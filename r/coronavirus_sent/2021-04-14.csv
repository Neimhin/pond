1,Same here.
2,I got my vaccine on April 4.
3,"&gt;Based on
experience with other vaccines any potential interference is most likely to result in a slightly
attenuated immune response to one of the vaccines."
4,"There is no evidence of any safety
concerns, although it may make the attribution of any adverse events more difficult."
5,"Because of the absence of data on co-administration with COVID-19 vaccines, it should
not be routine to offer appointments to give this vaccine at the same time as other
vaccines."
6,"Based on current information about the first COVID-19 vaccines being deployed,
scheduling should ideally be separated by an interval of at least 7 days to avoid incorrect
attribution of potential adverse events."

8,You're acting like like there isn't an opportunity cost to waiting.
9,"Maybe in US, sure it's a small cost, but elsewhere, no."
10,Unless there's future complications...
11,Which seems entirely possible.

16,*
17,I have one schedule for tomorrow AM don’t worry.
18,Just super confused how fast I’m working through symptoms and wondered if anyone else had it like this
19,Yeah I wish this was more known.
20,Just off health insurance because I'm 26 and was worried I wouldn't be able to get my second shot.
21,Maharashtra should be blamed on Maharashtra.
22,"I may not typically trust the center, but I definitely will never trust the Penguins."
23,"My wife just got that, and she's in her 30s."
24,.
25,.
26,.
27,Forget it.
28,I don't need to be worrying anymore.
29,I'm just glad we are vaccinated now.
30,Fuck.
31,I have not read the details.
32,Would not be surprised if it means they just let you die if doctors in your network are too busy.
33,Please read the headline and my comment again.
34,"Or like, more in general."
35,Individual people becoming sick and requiring medical attention is something that drags down the whole economy at some level.
36,"Having a publically funded system that focuses on preventative care, and distributes cost throughout the population means fewer people have to choose between their wallet and the care they need, and can live life without a lot of stress and with greater freedom."
37,most people who work are eligible which is how everyone I know got their vax
38,"You didnt this to be fair, but it is logically inconsistent to say the denominator is smaller for the risk (which is fair and may be true), but while also supporting removing access to everyone."
39,"If you're going to point to certain groups of people at risk for the risk rate, than you should be advocating for restricting it for just those groups of people"
40,Yes yes yes yes!
41,"Bye bye Covid, off to the history books with you."
42,The sympathisers can forget about their 'common cold' fantasy.
43,send them to me in australia.
44,"Get a covid test, only way to know"
45,"Pretty sure these vaccines aren't being stopped because of blood clots or other rare cases, but because of what those cases suggest long-term."
46,But that's just me.
47,I've had COVID.
48,It sucked.
49,Still can't smell anything since January.
50,32 years old.
51,Don't really care what anyone calls me.
52,I'm never taking a vaccine.
53,I've had allergic reactions to too many things in life and have an autoimmune disorder.
54,I know what I get if I get COVID again.
55,I don't know what I'd get with a vaccine.
56,Now or in the future.
57,Not an anti-vaxxer.
58,Never will be.
59,These ones?
60,Scare the shit out of me.
61,I think private businesses are free to do what they wish.
62,I’m not talking about target or Walmart requiring cards to enter.
63,"I’m talking about vaccinations being required for air travel, cruises, festivals, concerts, and so forth."
64,"Yes, I think it’d encourage those on the fence about the vaccine who wish to participate in those things to get the vaccine."
65,Funny how Scandinavian countries are often seen to be logical and base countless decisions on empirical data yet are totally kneejerking about this vaccine.
66,The number of clots in millions of cases is so miniscule it's statistically irrelevant.
67,If you vaccinate MILLIONS of people youre going to be vaccinating people with underlying health conditions (these are those people initially vaccinated!)
68,and chances are they would have experienced similar from just existing within that same period of time.
69,"January: We can probably ditch masks and social distancing by Memorial Day

April: May is too early, how about July 4?"
70,Well congrats!
71,"It took me reading what you said like 3 times before it sunk in, haha."
72,"Anyways, okay sure, regardless that will still be a shit load of people that would need to be classified as a Covid death after fully vaccinated."
73,"With millions of people vaccinated, and a large portion of them 65+ or with serious comorbidities, anyone of those hospitalized or dying within 30 days of a positive PCR test will need to be reported."
74,And that will definitely at the minimum be tens of thousands.
75,That’s if they want an apples to apples comparison to what we have been reporting for the past year.
76,"Oh, two doses are definitely the goal, that is not the question."
77,"The reason we are getting and discussing one-dose efficacy is, well, because most people ony got one dose and it will take up to 3 months (12 weeks) to give a second dose."
78,"So all we can do in the meanwhile is keep testing and checking how well it is working at the moment, or sit on our asses for 12+2 weeks before we discuss how both doses perform; I think the choice is obvious."
79,"It matters to see how they are performing at a midpoint, because it is if nothing else an indicator to see how they might perform in the long term."
80,"And regarding stability, and effectiveness, be vary of over-simplifications."
81,"The numbers shared (67, 82, 93 percent) are, as you can see in this thread by other people and relevant sources, based on different studies, in different environments."
82,"Also they are mostly based on the phase 3 or phase 4 studies, which are realistically a small subset of the population (I think around 25k, not sure)."
83,"We have different strains, and some vaccines' effectivenes depend on the strain: you can see how this could skew results in favor, or agains any specific vaccine."
84,Apparently J&amp;J is much better at the South African variant than most others (including Pfizer/Biotech).
85,"Apparently, both AZ and Pfizer are having very similar real-life effect rates in the UK, where both are administered, but I am not sure what the numbers are."
86,"&amp;#x200B;

P.S."
87,Continue to follow the guidelines even after the second dose.
88,"It is my understanding that any vaccine, including this one, helps with the immune system, as in, it does not prevent infection, but symptoms/death."
89,"So it basically might be making you a *certainly asymptomatic* carrier, and your body might kill the virus fast(er), but not fast enough to stop spreading, so we should all keep wearing masks and such until herd immunity is achieved (and not until me or you get vaccinated)."
90,"*\[Last paragraph is my personal understanding, not a statement of fact, feel free to research before you take it for granted.\]*"
91,"Yeah you must be young, no offense."
92,The amount of stupid out there is high and you get it hamfisted up your arse in the business world.
93,Fortune 50/100.
94,It's ... unsettling sometimes.
95,And Australia hopefully.
96,"Don't worry mate, at the rate my country is going we're expecting to get vaccinated by about 2036"
97,The CDC recommends you do not get a covid shot within 2 weeks of another vaccine shot.'
98,My state (NY) specifically asks you if you got another vaccine within 14 days and will not let you schedule if you say yes
99,Nearly all people on here are data illiterate.
100,I don’t care what they think.
101,Ba- boom!
102,So far the second jab appears to not present much risk.

104,Then you'll be very disappointed at the end of the summer when they're still in place.
105,Sorry.
106,How did so many people get doses?
107,"I know a few counties have opened up to 18+, but until the 15th, most people under 50 are ineligible."
108,Did everyone just fib?

133,"Probably a combination of survivors building an immunity, non-pharmaceutical interventions like masking, distancing, hygiene and quarantines, and possibly the virus mutating to a less destructive endemic form."
134,You can still find genetic traces of the 1918 pandemic in today's seasonal flu strains.
135,Ever heard of a little thing called herd immunity?
136,One person vaccinated - when the majority of the herd is unvaccinated = need to wear masks still.
137,It’s not forever and your post completely removes the context of the reality of the situation in bad faith.
138,Yeah same thing tell customers its free and they seem genuinely shocked.
139,"I had my second Pfizer on Monday and about 18 hours later got hit with what felt like an intense flu: 100.8 fever, chills, shattering teeth, totally exhausted and some stomach cramps."
140,Lasted only three hours and have been fine ever since!
141,It really seems to be so different for everyone!
142,Go to the cvs website for covid vaccines and there is a link specifically for people who just need their second dose and got their first dose elsewhere.
143,"Keep checking there for availability and you’ll likely find something, that’s what happened with me."
144,I thought I was tough until a Rez doctor pin cushioned me with freezing finally after the 8th attempt at finding the right spot I went out
145,"I have no idea why you'd suggest such a thing, then, knowing how strongly southerners care about their rights."
146,"I mean, I personally saw a store manager get laid out for telling a guy to put his mask on."
147,"Granted, I wasn't wearing one, either, but half the other shoppers weren't, as well."
148,"I mean, honestly, do you think this is going to work?"
149,Who would enforce this?
150,The police that won't wear masks or may not even get vaccinated themselves?
151,Let's use some common sense here before we start suggesting random shit that makes no sense.
152,Me too I got mine on the 9th.
153,I’m 35.
154,My anxiety is 9/10 as I am on day 5 and most people are experiencing this on day 5-10
155,Ask.
156,A.
157,Doctor.
158,Not Reddit.
159,Nobody here is qualified to help you.
160,LabCorp is still chasing me down for insane labwork fees I refuse to pay for.
161,My doctor ordered a Vitamin D test for me (turns out I do have a Vitamin D deficiency).
162,Insurance decided they randomly don't cover Vitamin D tests...as if I would have known that somehow.
163,I get a bill from LabCorp for $500.
164,For a single test.
165,"After a year of back and forth arguing with insurance, they tell me I have to file an appeal with a letter from my doctor."
166,"I call the doctor's office, they say they have no idea what I'm talking about, and they don't write appeal letters."
167,Fuck that.
168,"On another occasion my labwork was supposed to be insurance covered, I got a bill in the mail for $1200."
169,WTF.
170,"I call my insurance, who tells me that it was denied because I got the test out of state."
171,Except I didn't get it out of state.
172,So I call LabCorp.
173,"Turns out they sent the claim to insurance from their central billing office, which has an address in the next state over."
174,They say they can't fix it and I need to call insurance company.
175,"I call insurance company...they say they can't fix it, I need to call labcorp."
176,Eventually said fuck it I pay thousands of dollars per year for insurance they can fight it out themselves.
177,"Been 6+ years without paying, somehow hasn't dinged my credit score yet."
178,these pearls don’t clutch themselves
179,It's simple get the shot or get sick your choice.
180,There's significant overlap between the set of people who've gotten COVID and the set of people who've gotten the vaccine.
181,"You can't just add the 30% who've gotten COVID to however many have gotten the vaccine, because of that significant overlap."
182,Does that include people who take the morning after pill in the case of a known error or breakage with condoms?
183,That has much fewer side effects than being on the pill ongoing.
184,Of course I would also take an abortion over being on the pill.

186,"I hear people don't cancel their vaccine appointments when getting their vaccine shot sooner somewhere else, it's just going to delay herd immunity so much further"
187,Except that a) the vaccines provoke a better immune response than infection and b) real world data which has been posted in this sub show excellent protection against infection at least by the mRNA vaccines.

190,"Why bother, when people essentially ignore them, anyway."
191,"And now, with a vaccine, people truly think ""it's no worse than the flu"" - ignoring the fact, of course, that we have no real idea how well these vaccines functi9n, over longer periods of time."
192,"Correct but doctors don’t explain this, at least they certainly didn’t to me"
193,I wouldn’t.
194,"I would however, insist that the governments stop the lockdowns."

279,What about Brazilian and South African strains?
280,What about the double mutant indian strain?
281,"If anyone has any idea with the latest developments please let me know, was curious."
282,Are all the strains just an increase in transmission?
283,Increasing infectiousness and decrease in virulence is usually the normal lifecycle of a virus is it not?
284,Canada gets its vaccine from exactly the same location as Israel (the EU).
285,Israel simply paid more money and gave Pfizer more Data.
286,Which is a strategy that works as long as no one else pays Pfizer even more money.
287,Which would end up in a race who can shove the most money into Pfizer to get their population vaccinated slightly earlier.
288,Which would be stupid and beneficial to no one.
289,I didnt advocate for anything.
290,I just pointed it out its not correct to say risk is just 1:1 000 000 when some group of people are at much higher risk.
291,I explained with other examples.
292,It is and that is kinda my point.
293,"My risk level is lower, and I'd still take the vaccine risk over the covid risk"

310,I've been told that reimbursement is higher on the second dose.

339,"Like I really don't get this, we trash them about vaccines, but they live longer."
340,Maybe they have it right.
341,The CVS website didn't word it as free it just said it could be free with government assistance program which most of the time is social security required so we just wanted to see be ready how much money to bring when I take him in the am.
342,There's been a lot of articles about kids and covid recently.
343,they did nothing
344,Which is great.
345,I hope it lasts 5 years.
346,My point is to start banning people from concerts when we don't know is laughable.
347,"If we have to start getting boosters every year, the logistical nightmare of updated vaccine status with the federal government will be a NIGHTMARE."
348,i signed up my mom for the local hospita; bc it was the only one i could find since i had been looking for like 2 days in my area since her group was able to.
349,when i got back from work and called her she said they had charged 70 for the service free.
350,is it free or are they still supposed to do that?
351,I truly don't understand people who could be so laissez faire about there own health during a pandemic.
352,"My boss told me that Scott and white had a scheduler set up for it, instead of other sites where you had to call."
353,"I tried it and managed to nab an apt for that day, and ended up leaving that meeting early to head out."
354,"He was happy I got one, but a bit annoyed as his was scheduled for a week out still."
355,"I'd heard about the risks of blood clots with bc pills before, but didn't think it was that big."
356,Did a Google search and have found articles dating back years of young girls having died because of it here.
357,"Makes me  wonder though, why are these used so much when there are other types of bc that are much less dangerous."
358,Lucky!
359,"I don't get paid and I got chills, massive headache, knee pain and some fever... :( I haven't been able to work for 2 days (I got my vaccine on Tuesday)."
360,Thank goodness I have sick pay though.
361,"India's going through a second wave, and my parents need to get their AZ second dose within the next two weeks (6-8 weeks gap b/w the two shots)."
362,"My city's pretty much exploding with cases, and there are few reports of vaccine shortages as well."
363,"People will begin coming for their second doses within the next few weeks as well, so that may worsen the situation."
364,"Should they wait it out a couple of weeks for greater long-term efficacy, or should they get vaccinated ASAP?"
365,I think what they're implying is that so few people want AZ that they just have loads sitting around.
366,I looked it up and they're opening clubs at 50% capacity from the 29th.
367,"I have a hard time picturing a general gym with a broad clientele (children, elderly, family people, single people, etc.)"
368,doing that.
369,An MA gym is largely going to be young single adults all with a shared interest.
370,MA gyms operate more like clubs and even cults sometimes as opposed to a gym where just anyone walks in and does their workout and leaves.
371,I’m getting my first dose of Pfizer today in CA!
372,They just opened eligibility to everyone in state.
373,It feels like I’m finally at the end of the tunnel.
374,Just a little bit farther.
375,"Not at all, we’re dead last in vaccinations in the EU, third in deaths."
376,"Clubs open at the end of the month, though."
377,"People just don’t want to vaccinate with AZ, we have a big Pfizer delivery coming over the next month, so a lot of them are waiting on that."
378,Most are just scared off vaccinations now.
379,Alot of people get it because they don't know it's still experimental.
380,Both of these facts should be publicized so people can make a fully informed decision.
381,Well that's to be expected in America who has ever had free health care.
382,The servers can get vaccinated too if they are that concerned
383,"They haven't reduced production, they have stopped shipping to EU."
384,"The reason is that under their contract, they aren't denied of liability and are therefore are staying on the safe side"
385,Did they also manufacture?
386,My point is western governments are inefficient and without pharma companies and the private sector we'd still be sitting at home.
387,"Companies don't have a money printer, they need to make profit."
388,"No, the companies are liable in the EU but not elsewhere."

404,"Senor, es gratis?"
405,Everything I have heard is that you should still get the vaccine because anyone who had a mild case of covid may not have had a strong enough immune response to ensure they have protection from re-infection.
406,It's safest to do the vaccine just to be sure you have the best chance of avoiding reinfection and be best protected from the various strains.

409,"I’m all fairness to Pfizer they’ve reduced the storage requirements, but yes it’s still far more expensive than any other vaccine."
410,I also find it quite odd that people are taking whatever Pfizer report as the truth.
411,Do people really think that they’re not cherry picking data to sell their products?
412,Can’t speak for the other governments but the universities in the UK (public gov funded) have done a significant amount of the research.
413,Oxford / Astra Zeneca for example was 97% public funded.

417,I personally have 6 friends getting vaccinated between tomorrow and the 18th.
418,All healthy late 20s/early 30s WFH tech workers that badly want the vaccine but have been waiting their turn.
419,"There's two more that want to be vaccinated but are waiting for ""higher risk people"" to get the shot first."
420,This is mostly them not paying close attention since we are at over 50% of our adult population vaccinated in King County but I have no doubt they will have their first shot by early May.
421,"King County is going to come in with a way higher percentage than the nation at large, but I think the idea that everyone on the West Coast that wants one has got one is missing the mark by a lot."
422,Only the wealthiest countries have been able to afford testing on such a widespread scale that they are able to actually confirm that their recently deceased were infected with the virus.

438,I think actually a lot of the concerns so-called 'antivaxxers' (who vary in crankishness) have about vaccine safety *are* recognised by regulators and printed on the vaccine leaflets as possible side-effects.
439,People get denounced as conspiracy theorists a lot even for mentioning those things.
440,"In a limited sense, we're all anti-vaxxers now, by certain older definitions."
441,"The issue is that 'antivaxxer' is not a well-specified term, so it includes both reasonable and unreasonable people."
442,Now you're bringing probability back into it.

467,My father got vaccinated like 1 month ago.
468,He is a journalist and they asked everyone in his company if they want to be vaccinated.
469,My father does 3 magazines and very rarely sees people or goes to events.
470,"Also on the vaccination place my father asked if they can also vaccinate his girlfriend, who was waiting for him outside."
471,They vaccinated her as well.
472,They are both in their 50s

474,Yep.

498,AstraZeneca is the one company that does not make a profit from its covid vaccine.

512,Thanks I will keep doing that.
513,Otherwise I guess it's okay to get the second dose 4 weeks apart.
514,We can easily not recommend it for specific demographics.
515,"Save for the over 50s, or just men, or let it continue on with a waiver."
516,mental health is a backseat concern for the world right now.

520,It's bad.
521,"i live in minnesota, its been high demand for a vaccine."
522,i got in by staying up late and booking with cvs.
523,just checked and they have doses in rochester and duluth available now.
524,not even checking late night.
525,"so, at least in my area, demand is satisfied."
526,"if it was a month ago, i might agree with you."
527,"but, its also a matter of PR."
528,we cannot have anti vaxxers have even a shred of a legit argument.
529,the pain from that will go far beyond covid and into the next pandemic.
530,and even if JnJ was the ONLY vaccine available i still wouldnt support CDC keeping it going.
531,thats a presidential level decision.
532,You could just look at how many people were fully vaccinated 2 weeks go for a rough approximation.
533,What are the chances that a pcr test comes back as a false negative if I tested 2 days after exposure?
534,Is it?
535,Like of you develop side effects you get free treatment?
536,Do you get free medication with the shot?
537,"https://www.asbmb.org/asbmb-today/science/040421/how-effective-is-the-first-shot-of-the-pfizer-or-m has some information on your question

Apparently the body takes around 2 weeks to build the antibodies, so you have almost no additional immunity the day after the vaccine but it increases sharply 2 weeks after the vaccine."
538,That’s why the CDC uses 2 weeks after the second dose to determine fully vaccinated.
539,"If that person isn’t a troll, that’s absolutely insane."
540,One died.
541,Six others affected.
542,I believe the term “fully vaccinated” they’re using is referring to 2 weeks after second dose.

544,and i think you're unnecessarily putting a large amount of people at risk and playing monday morning qb in a field you don't really have expertise in....
545,"Yeah, this political move is really helpful, even though it wasn't needed at all."
546,"To add, an obvious difference is how much a small error matters."
547,The polls in 2016 were a few percentage points off.
548,That has minimal impact on issue polling but results in completely different outcomes for an election.
549,Article stated little over 396 hospitalization and 74 death and 40% being of the infection being of the age 60+
550,Good.
551,In about a month almost everyone who wants a vaccine will have one and pretty much all higher risk people have been offered.
552,If you don’t want to go out stay at home.
553,"I think Polis (and DeWine here in Ohio) has been a good job balancing public health with education, the economy and mental health unlike Desantis or Cumuo who both went the opposite directions of wrong."

564,It means you weigh the risks of the vaccine against the risks of giving vaccines slower.
565,I'm not convinced the CDC is really appreciating that.
566,"And yes, that's also an argument for approving Oxford/AstraZeneca, or at least for considering it more than they are now."
567,[removed]
568,This seems like a pretty easy problem to fix
569,"It will certainly be interesting to see what direction the virus goes evolutionarily 

It is definitely true that there is a beyond coincidental occurrence of E484K and E484K like mutations across variants."
570,It does seem like most variants are converging on a subset of similar mutations on the same regions
571,The fact that new variants might be more easily spread/caught by children and the fact that long COVID also effects children plays into this as well.
572,"I know, I've been reading so much literature regarding that, but it'll be hard to not stress if anything happens withing next 2 weeks."
573,I know it's very miniscule but still wouldn't want her to become a part of that 4 in a million statistic.
574,"Not bashing the vaccine, it's very essential here for the lack of other options and surge of cases, but thanks for the heads up."
575,Just wait til anti-vaxxers complain about how unfair the big pharma is to the woke people
576,The US export ban was announced in December 20 if I'm not mistaken.
577,That's way after investment were made for vaccine production.
578,"Say it the way you want, that's a selfish policy from the US and we can be proud EU have keep their market open."
579,Concur.
580,We might be at peak rate as hesitancy and laziness are going to start slowing the rate down.
581,"Hopefully I am wrong and as it gets easier, lazy can be defeated."
582,"I don't expect this to actually matter, but it's dumb to rule out allowing schools to do something this soon."
583,"I mean if the pandemic is pretty much over at that point, then schools aren't going to be interested in requiring masks anyway."
584,This is the exact scenario we have right now in Ontario.
585,We've vaccinated our LTC residents so we're seeing very few outbreak deaths and overall deaths are currently low as well.
586,"But our ICU numbers are the worst they've been during the entire pandemic, and ICU admissions are trending towards much younger people than they were in the last wave."
587,"So we got forced back into lockdown because although our deaths are low, our hospitalization and ICU numbers are insane."
588,"Even with restrictions, they're preparing triage guidelines where you get routed to palliative care rather than ICU if some online tool assesses you have a 12-month survival probability of less than 20% (moving up incrementally as the situation becomes more severe)."
589,"We're expecting vaccinations will eventually turn the tide, but not until around mid-July."
590,So our politicians grudgingly had to re-implement lockdown.
591,"Everyone is just as pandemic-fatigued here as elsewhere, but it got so bad that we had no alternative."
592,"The U.S. may not go down this path though, since you guys are doing much, much faster with the pace of your vaccinations, so an ICU crunch can be starved off by pace of vaccination is my guess."
593,[removed]
594,"or dying from being struck by lightning, for the matter."
595,the necessity for speed doesn't mean you throw away good judgement.... if you want speed then go tell the good folks at the fda that they need to go approve the oxford vaccine too because by and large these are the same concerns as the jnj one right?
596,Are you considered Gen-X?
597,Just scheduled my first dose for Pfizer.
598,Connecticut is really killing the vaccine game over here!
599,Then we do it all over again with the variants booster.
600,Then we will be in a very good place.

611,Sorry to spoil your confirmation bias.
612,"this is so sad to hear about...where I am there's quite a vaccine shortage and people's appointments are getting cancelled/postponed, and I would imagine even more so since the pause was called on J&amp;J."

623,Mine took almost 2 hours..
624,"depends on where you are located, i guess."
625,Here in the northeast few or none of the policy decisions that were made were overcautious in any meaningful way.
626,In fact we almost did too little and/or didn’t move fast enough.
627,"We locked down pretty hard and our hospital and mortuary systems were still teetering on the brink of collapse in some places during spring 2020, particularly NYC"
628,To be fair that is very confusing at face value.
629,"Whenever I set up an appointment to get tested it had me submit my insurance info and referring physician, even if there wasn't one."
630,I can definitely understand how some people would see some of the prompts and go 'oh well I guess I can't do it then'.
631,At least in Rhode Island it was fairly confusing at first.
632,Now there's a comparison people should be making on the news when they talk about it.
633,I saw someone saying they were worried it was a scam when they were offered the vaccine for free..
634,I really hope this message gets out there.
635,Is this new surge due to variants?
636,This article is discussing how there will not be a mask mandate in Florida in the fall.
637,I am saying that’s not going to be a public health problem.
638,I still have no idea what you’re trying to get at
639,"And BioNTech and Pfizer [are testing a freeze-dried version of their vaccine](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/covid-19-tracker-johnson-johnson-aims-to-test-shot-kids-president-trump-talks-firing-fauci):

&gt;UPDATED: Wednesday, March 31 at 3:45 p.m.
&gt;Pfizer and BioNTech plan to test a freeze-dried version of their COVID-19 vaccine, which if proven safe could ease delivery of the shot to rural areas and low-income countries."
640,A powdered formulation of the vaccine would allow transportation and storage at normal temperatures instead of the ultracold storage it now needs.
641,"If successful, the new form of the vaccine could be ready early next year, Pfizer told investors on an earning call last month."
642,Yea I can’t believe how far behind Canada is compared to the US.
643,"It’s like you’re still trying to vaccinate your elderly while, we’re almost at the point where we’re struggling to find people to administer it to."
644,I’m sure that will mean supply will start shifting your way.
645,But I wonder why your rate of supply and administration is so much slower?
646,Day after my second Moderna shot had a headache and took a nap.
647,My wife had zero side effects.
648,"Fauci said something like it's obviously women in child-rearing age, might be hormonal/birth control related."
649,It's anyone's guess at this point though.

651,I would stay far tf away from this place.
652,Good news.
653,How long will this take?
654,The biggest bandaid in the universe that gets bigger and bigger as we vaccinate more people.
655,Soon the R value will be negligible because so many will be immune from the vaccine or naturally.
656,"If there aren't that many people left to catch it,  there won't be people to spread it and die from it."
657,All vaccines?
658,What?
659,"Can't believe 34,163 in Florida were too stupid to do that before they died"
660,"Yeah what the other guy said is that 'Indian government has not invested a penny yet', which is categorically untrue."
661,I got denied the claim of my Covid test at a cvs even after I called.
662,Would have to pay $149; had to call back like a month and half later to complain since it was supposed to be free... took them like another 2-3 weeks to approve my claim
663,Let’s see the actual hospitalization situation when the time comes.
664,"80% of 65+ year olds in the US have a vaccine shot in them, that eliminates quite a bit of the risk of being overwhelmed."
665,Weird that they bother then.
666,"That's clearly much less than how much it actually costs to get a shot in the arm, so why bother mostly subsidizing but not fully subsidizing it?"
667,Get a vaccine
668,"Damn, it didn't take long for America to get blamed for this somehow, first comment right out of the fucking gate!"
669,"Nothing is so simple as to be “the entire point.”

Vaccines reduce your individual chances but more importantly they reduce transmission."
670,"(Yes, when the EUAs were granted, they hadn’t been evaluated for transmissibility but studies on that have since come out.)"
671,"But even on an individual level, it will stop *most* (but not all) people from getting sick at all"

676,"&gt;They also get to join a special club called the do not fly list

I landed in JAX last week and all around me were GAs announcing ""if you do not wear a provided mask, you will never be allowed to fly on our airline again"" over and over, which was shocking coming from DC lol."
677,Why only 4 hours?
678,Agree.
679,"It is a common mistake  to miss by a power of 10 when dealing with percentages, I was just pointing that out in case you missed it."
680,"To be honest, I don't really think we know and that's the point."
681,I got a $40 ‘administration fee’ bill and my insurance basically was no help.
682,I’m a little peeved as my second shot is tomorrow and I’m gonna get a second bill for that.
683,The beautiful thing is they are 95% effective in preventing even asymptomatic cases so it almost always makes the recipient never get it.. A study in the US of vaccinated hospital workers was done.
684,"A few still had cases, but nothing like you'd expect if they'd been unvaccinated."
685,They tested them weekly.
686,The cdc published the report.
687,"Studies from Israel, the UK, and South Africa all confirm the same finding."
688,"&gt; Is anyone else tired of

Yes."
689,I'm sure we're all tired of most of this
690,Isn’t this what Public Service Announcements (PSAs) are for?
691,Is it still possible to reach the masses via television commercials?
692,"Do we have the equivalent of the PSA agreement that we have with television stations with social media companies, like Facebook or even Reddit."
693,Anything with paid advertising could be a mode of reaching people.
694,We didn't find the cure for polio either but eradicated it through vaccination and herd immunity...which is the whole point here
695,"Well being hospitalized for Covid could cost $10,000 so they can only assume the vaccine costs something under that number..."
696,"Ah, I don't fly either of those!"
697,"JetBlue was the most stringent by far between them, SW, and AA."
698,I can’t even imagine trying to organize census in India.
699,How accurate could it possibly be?
700,"Not everybody has TV anymore/watches news, keeps up with social media."

702,"Even then, it is rare that a cure works 100% of the time."

707,I got mine at the DOH for my county and never left my vehicle.
708,Japan has received 15 million vaccine doses from Pfizer and is getting more by the week.
709,It's a farce that they've only vaccinated 1.7 million people.
710,Cute.
711,"They floated that as a possibility, and then quickly backtracked after public outcry."
712,No one is stopping you from doing that.
713,Right.
714,"Just being conservative since I'm using assumptions and rounding because people on this thread would nitpick and say ""wellllll actually it's 98% because...""."
715,Even 90% is amazing!
716,!
717,The key point here is how much this will cut down rates.

724,"Right, and being unable to test for it is a great reason to tell everyone to make homemade masks and start wearing them."
725,Lying to the public never works.
726,"The public finds out, and it kills your credibility."
727,"A message of “masking is critical, but please don’t go buy N-95 because healthcare workers need them more” would have worked."
728,"The same people who were buying up N-95s still would have bought them, and the same people donating them to hospitals still would have."
729,But a several month head start on masking would have made a huge difference.
730,My area has had much lower case rates than the surrounding ones.
731,"A part of that is that local women got organized in early March, and started making thousands of masks."
732,"The entire county got really good masks that way, earlier on."
733,Quality of masks definitely affects willingness to wear them too.
734,The difference between wearing a well firing one and a shitty one is huge.
735,"Yes, the last guy (I’m guessing this subs overactive auto mod won’t like his name) did the most damage to the US effort, and bringing 500,000 manslaughter charges against him would be more than reasonable."
736,But that doesn’t excuse the WHO and CDC fuckups.
737,The refusal to say that covid was airborne for months was about as bad as the masking debacle.
738,"Every other coronavirus is, but instead they had people freaking out about surface spread and doing cleaning theater, when what mattered was ventilation."
739,"Again, the ripple effects of that decision has a massive death toll."
740,This crisis has proved public health is in desperate need of reform.
741,"If we let the fact that we got lucky on vaccines, and the logistics experts did their job well hide the fact that the public health people completely failed, we’ll pay the price in the next crisis."
742,We need to get rid of insurance companies.
743,That’s the problem here.
744,Even with current rate of vaccination 70%+ of adults in all EU will get their first shot by this July.
745,"So it's not just likely, it's pretty much certainty at this point."
746,"Get shot on Monday and if you get symptoms that are bad enough to keep you home, you get to stay home"
747,I'm hearing that minimum wages are still $12 us?
748,[removed]
749,No one cares?
750,Pfizer didn't even apply for approval and sought orders first (clear bully).
751,And all the British media (and government...) were screeching that it was all being made up by jealous Europeans who hated the British vaccine.
752,"Over two weeks after the events that this article is describing, even a respectable paper like the FT had Kate Bingham come on to say AZ were ""heroes"" and accuse the European countries that were investigating these issues of ""bickering"" and engaging in ""geopolitics""."
753,Agree with everything except for that last bit of language.
754,"You tell those stragglers that the guv'ment is ""rounding up the kids"" and shotgun shells will fly everywhere."
755,Language really matters here.
756,People freak out easy.
757,They had no idea how widespread Covid was because we had no way of testing for it.
758,"It's easy to say that now, knowing what we know."
759,"But we didn't even know about it until 12/31

The person who shoulders the most blame, that downplayed the pandemic the most by telling people it was nothing and that it was going away, was fired."
760,In November
761,"&gt;I heard, the UK is paying three or four times as much per dose as the EU

Its nowhere near that."
762,"Haggling on costs is what got the EU into the trouble it finds itself in while other countries acted sooner and embarked on a spending spree to ensure they had the supplies - fine example of this, the UK."
763,So why are Pfizer doses being exported to the U.K. now if the EU has priority?
764,Why don't they just simply ask somebody if it's free..
765,No.
766,Because all medications have potential side effects.
767,Risks vs rewards.
768,You're discounting the seriousness of it.
769,Here's a quote about the AstraZeneca vaccine which is similar.
770,"&gt; Health authorities estimate the syndrome affects four to six cases per 1 million AstraZeneca vaccine recipients, but it can cause a death rate of up to 25% when it occurs."
771,"Say you vaccinated 23 million people, roughly the population of Taiwan, then 138 people get the clotting issue."
772,"25% of those die, so 35 people die from the vaccine."
773,Which is still a lot of people dying from just an injection when they only had 11 deaths in the whole pandemic.
774,The cure is literally 3 times worse than the disease.
775,You would definitely want to pause that vaccine and see if you can get some better monitoring or workaround for when the clotting occurs so people don't die.

785,Only now that a UK doctor is saying this can we be confident it is true.
786,Sorry what?
787,Have you read the article?
788,"EDIt: well your posting history speaks volumes, it must be incredibly hard holding such vitriol towards the British that you would be blinded to the facts laid bare in this article"
789,Covid was widespread in January and February.
790,April 2nd is way fucking late.
791,There initial response was a blatant lie that masks would do nothing unless they were professionally fitted medical masks.
792,"They did it in part to try and preserve the medical supply chain, which a moments thought would tell you would collapse regardless."
793,And in part because they didn’t want to admit that they had been dead wrong about the effectiveness of masking for decades.
794,"They had claimed for years that masking wasn’t the reason Korea and Japan had lower flu rates, and they didn’t want to lose face."
795,"Slow down the early growth of cases, and the total number would be a fraction of what they are now."
796,That’s hundreds of thousands if not millions of lives.
797,"The month of March is the time that mattered, and that’s the time they made the dumbest, most shortsighted decisions."
798,"Firing everyone involved is worth it, both to bring in new blood, and to send the message that you don’t keep your job when your fuck up has a six figure body count."
799,Was that an actual 0 deaths on that day?
800,Or was it due to bundling of data from deaths?
801,"It's called a joke bro, get the stick out of your ass."
802,And either way your point is shit.
803,"&gt;people who are worried about the cost of the vaccine are not the same people who are getting out of paying their taxes

So?"
804,"Whether they get the vaccine or not their taxes remain the same, so why does it matter if the person worried about the cost pays taxes?"
805,First you miss my obvious joke and now you are trying to use dumbass logic to justify your pointless comments.

817,"&gt; And the understanding as to why this variant is growing is very simple, viruses multiply."
818,"That's not the point, it's growing as a proportion of all variants."
819,"&gt; As I pointed out and is clear in the report you linked several other variants, such as P.1 (another E484K carrying variant) are actually outpacing it and that’s in conjunction with widespread proliferation of B.1.1.7

Yeah that's not good either, the fact that variants we are concerned about for various reasons are growing as a proportion of our overall variant mix."
820,"the variants, my friend."
821,the variants.
822,the maskless idiots spread new variants ( the new york variant and the UK variant in NYC) and as of right now the 3 vaccines offer some protection against 2 of the three dominant variants but if the idiots keep spreading then new variants will emerge.
823,"Look there is no way out of this: it's a pandemic, the virus is deadly, masks and preventions are the only way."
824,It's not a joke: we can't afford maskless idiots anymore.

831,Everyone will know immediately.
832,Eventually all kids are going to have to be vaccinated in order to attend school.

834,Someone has to do it.
835,"Delusional bong, lmao."
836,"because lockdowns worked so good in the past, we for sure need to keep them going."
837,for example - do something about the lack of ICU beds after 14 months instead of saying how we need to protect the healthcare system
838,"Somebody check my math please but it looks like the death rate is almost the same, about ~1-2% in both populations."
839,The obvious difference being the probability of catching it drops dramatically if you've had the jab.
840,"It's great news, but if you do catch it you are just as likely screwed."
841,"British media is such garbage, lmao.."
842,"Hundreds of articles about how there was no such link, and now when its proven, its a ""Uk doctor"" who found it, lmao."
843,The information in this tweet wasn’t submitted in the paper that was released when this article was published.
844,The tweet came after the publication.

846,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.06.21254882v1.full.pdf
847,Does anyone know if you can still spread the virus although you have developed immunity(for example recovered individual who has developed anti bodies)?
848,"Maybe I am daft but the most alarming thing from this article is that 78 deaths out of 5,800 breakthrough cases."
849,Means a 1.2% mortality rate if you do get covid after being vaccinated.
850,That seems completely the same as an unvaccinated person.
851,But they found a way not to fuck up their economies that much.
852,"Just order the plebes to stay at home except for work, blame them for not staying at home enough when this strategy inevitably fails."
853,What?
854,"If you look at the countries that have eliminated COVID they aren't accepting people carte blanche.. regardless of if they have previously had covid, or who have been vaccinated."
855,They require all visitors to go through quarantine - and even that isn't 100%.
856,All other approaches have failed.
857,We're catching up very fast.
858,Average vaccination rate is 2.4mln per day now.
859,One month ago it was just 1.3 mln.
860,We've vaccinated as many people in the last month as we did in first 2.5 months of vaccination.
861,"I know that reddit paints the picture that EU is nothing but a failure in that regard, but in reality we're only several weeks behind UK and US and will likely vaccinate majority of adults during this summer."
862,Jesus Christ.
863,The pandemic started in earnest in mid March.
864,"By April 2nd, the CDC told people to wear masks

We weren't prepared."
865,Science changes.

868,😂😂😂 Participants being all white has next to nothing to do with efficacy and safety lol.
869,But it's also been tested in India and it showed the exact same efficacy.

874,Shame of those Europeans for dying of blood clots and undermining public faith just to get back at the UK for Brexit!
875,All vaccines were developed like that.
876,The risk from what I read us how people react to common Coronavirus after the vaccine.
877,A virologist that worked for bill gates said the  mRNA shots will diminish our own body's ability to fight common Coronaviruses.
878,74 deaths in 5800 infections is about 1.2% fatality.
879,"So either there are a lot of infections going unreported, or the fatality rate (once infected) is about the same as for unvaccinated people."
880,Not really.
881,"There weren’t enough cases to formally link these events to the vaccine, the MHRA were being less cautious than the rest of Europe likely due to UK reliance on the vaccine."
882,"Yeah, that very racially diverse source."
883,"You don’t need to retain antibodies to be immune,"
884,That’s the point.
885,"They found it at the same time, just some people made a public song and dance about finding out about it whilst others were more conservative and used more official channels."
886,Seems like for some doctors it’s a bit of a vanity project to have found this link
887,"Yeah, I don't know what the holdup is."
888,"Japanese appliance manufacturers even made an extra 10,000 super-cold freezers just for storing and transporting the Pfizer vaccine, so it's not like they weren't making an effort to prepare for it."
889,Yeah we do.
890,It's just how numbers work lol
891,If you read the article it is evident that the doctors likely came to the same conclusion at similar timeframes it’s just their approach to how they shared that information differed significantly.
892,"It seems the British doctor decided to formally share this information with worldwide colleagues through official channels whilst the Germans wanted to publish a paper and thus made this a big PR stunt for them and didn’t share their specific findings with the wider group, pretty abhorrent if you ask me."
893,Like the media reporting this article that didn’t go with that?
894,Easier said than done: not falling pray to the nocebo effect (which is the opposite of the placebo effect).
895,Pfizer&amp;Biontech is main one at the moment.
896,"AZ was supposed to be main one, but after so many blunders with it we signed additional purchases from Pfizer&amp;Biontech and just use remaining stock of AZ (though some countries have completely stopped using it)."
897,Redirecting to using  Pfizer&amp;Biontech as main vaccine is basically main reason why vaccination rates are finally going up in EU.
898,"What I mean by ""they"" is whoever responsible for all the Olympics events, like all of them."
899,"And think IOC will lose a lot of money for cancelling it altogether, I don't think it's even an option."
900,The only logical explanation is that they're losing a lot of money by what's happening and postponing it even more will cost them even more money.
901,I don't know what makes them so confidant that the pandemic will be under control in 2021.
902,No shit but the people who are worried about the cost of the vaccine are not the same people who are getting out of paying their taxes.
903,You're literally being contradictory just to be contradictory
904,These types of people don’t care about facts.
905,They want the new guy in charge to bungle things as bad as the last guy who was in charge.
906,"It’s not happening that way, so rather than admit they were wrong about the previous guy, they create false narratives and downplay the new guy’s success."
907,"It’s straight-up gaslighting, but it doesn’t work for anyone with a working brain because we can literally see the progress."
908,Yeah for sure.
909,He knew about the risks and still said that.
910,"Of course, me being me, and hearing that J&amp;J is having the same issues as AZ, I’m definitely going to avoid those in favor of Pfizer."
911,I’m super grateful the AE reporting is so robust that we can discover even rare occurrences and make our own informed decisions.
912,The medical and clinical systems we have in place are impressive—it’s a pretty incredible time to be born during this pandemic response during an information-rich era.
913,"The current numbers from ECDC on administered doses are Pfizer 70.2m, Astra 20.2m, and Moderna 6.5m."
914,"There's various reporting delays and omissions in these, the numbers from the national authorities are more complete."
915,"The deliveries of the J&amp;J vaccine had just started when it was suspended, so likely none have been administered."
916,E.g.
917,"Sweden received their first batch, but have put it on hold."
918,"Outside of the EU purchase, Hungary has administered 1.0m Sinopharm doses and 0.69m Sputnik V doses."
919,"A few other EU countries have ordered and received Chinese and Russian vaccines that are not approved by the EU, but there's no numbers on the actual administration of those."
920,Wasn't there an article with a doctor dying from taking the MRNA vaccines and 30 + people getting some type of blood disorders.
921,"Makes you wonder why the not-for-profit vaccines get singled out, while the vaccines making billions don't"
922,"This might still not be reflective of the efficacy that someone should expect in the general population because the vaccinations, up to this point, have prioritized senior citizens, and seniors are the ones whose immune systems are most likely to not develop the needed response, since as you age, your immune system weakens."
923,"As a european, i do not agree with this."
924,Ill take a week paid off.
925,"“Have you heard of research”
“Billboard for ignorance”

926,They went back on that stuff far as I can tell
927,Until you have to prove that you have had a booster shot for one more variant.
928,Then the real trouble begins.
929,I don't know what I can say that hasn't been said about Bolsonaro so far.
930,What a piece of garbage he is for a human being.
931,"Just to add perspective to this, 5800 cases, 396 hospitalizations and 74 deaths among 77 million fully vaccinated individuals is extremely good."
932,"Even if those numbers were just for one day, rather than four months, they'd represent just 7 percent of cases and 8 percent of deaths while making up roughly 25 percent of the total population."
933,"There are more vaccines out there than J&amp;J or AZ, so I understand those that want to wait for other options is all I'm saying."
934,"There is no point in judging those people for not wanting to die from side effects that they have an increased chance of getting due to medical reasons and wait a bit longer for a jab of, let's say, Pfizer."
935,"After all these people might have families to take care of, or who knows what other personal circumstances they have."
936,Let's not forget that we are also humans and not just numbers.
937,I bet it'll stabilise by mid July but also the new variants may decrease sooner than the original one so you may be right.
938,"Meanwhile people going bonkers in massive religious gathering and the data from those places seem sketchy as hell, so the numbers may be even higher."
939,"In any case, states should put curbs on election rallies atleast."
940,Like our state has not declared lockdown and we all know it's only because election drives have not ended yet.
941,"Although the election drives are being conducted hastily now, after certain lockdown hints are coming up so rapidly."
942,"As sad as this is for Cambodia, which has so far done very well during the pandemic, this is a very sensationalist and misleading headline."
943,"With 1,000 new cases and 35 deaths within a week this neither seems out of control nor a disaster to the extent we are facing in other parts of the world."
944,It also seems that the government is addressing this and that the population is largely compliant.
945,The vaccine has also hugely reduced infections.
946,Study out of Manchester uni demonstrated.
947,We can begin opening up slowly and carefully with a good test and trace plus community monitoring system and expect to be fine.
948,"Of course what we will do is all rush to the pub at once, while a mate of Matt Hancock pockets all the test and trace budget then find out if the other variants are effectively suppressed by the vaccines we already have in a massive uncontrolled experiment."
949,"Still, will be interesting."
950,It would appear authoritarians are particularly bad at managing pandemics
951,That the two events are related?
952,"for this ""horror"" scenario your vaccine will not do much as P1 widely escapes immunity."
953,its not a believe.
954,its reasonable human behavior.
955,stressing out over a miniscule risk is not healthy behavior.
956,"&gt; keep in mind that the virus is constantly mutating

its more likely to get less virulent."
957,even if it becomes more contagious.
958,its also one of those moot points as thats simply what viruses do.
959,you are not losing sleep over the flu suddenly becoming more deadly again.
960,which has happened just 2 years ago btw.
961,stay calm and collected and don't overreact is all I am saying.
962,For California?
963,I’d say 80-90 is doable.
964,Good chance all the protests we had over black shootings wouldn’t be nearly as large as they were.
965,"Probably around Eric garner protest level big, so still substantial but the protests we saw over the summer were probably the biggest the west had seen in decades."
966,And honestly I wonder if that Sarah Everhard story would even make it out of the UK.
967,Furthermore obviously not such a large increase in anti-Asian hate and violence.
968,On the downside Biden might have lost to Trump.
969,Or through our taxes.
970,Everything costs someone money.
971,Insurance is supposed to cover things like vaccines free of charge.
972,200 thousand + seems more descriptive than 0.2 million
973,I’d take whatever I can get.
974,"But I’m happy we have the better/best options here, and glad that the vaccines we have the most of aren’t being pulled or getting negative attention."
975,There was one death from J&amp;J vaccine in the US.
976,"You can focus on the person, but you can also focus on the 6.8M other people that took the J&amp;J vaccine, that will be protected from death by nearly 100% for the next year or so, even if they become infected as Covid is still raging."
977,"The side effects and death are a tragedy, but many lives will be saved from gasping to death in a Covid ward."
978,"Since we have an alternate vaccine, we have the luxury to use them instead."
979,"If we lived in a parallel reality where only J&amp;J was available, we would be better off to take it."
980,"The people that have already taken it, lowered their risk of death considerably even considering the clotting side effect."
981,"Nope, it was Slovakia's equivalent of FDA or EMA that found the discrepancies"
982,"There would be some political ramifications in the 2020 Presidential, Congressional, and Senatorial Elections."
983,"I won't speculate what they are in case it is against the rules, but the pandemic and the perceived response or lack thereof did measurably change things in the United States."
984,"Amidst the vaccine drives, people have stopped wearing masks and forgot about social distancing."
985,"As a result, second wave has hit the country that I live in."
986,The cases have gone double than the first wave last year.
987,Really terrified because vaccination will take months to complete given the population.
988,The official numbers are far higher.
989,There's a lot of underreporting going on.
990,The only thing I can possibly think of is that they believe some fucking conspiracy about vaccines implanting microchips or some shit like that.
991,"No matter what it is, while I love to joke about *natural selection* and all, the fact that they are promoting this kind of shit is just killing more people and leading to people uninvolved in their BS to get infected."
992,Small correction.
993,Blood clots associated with the vaccine.
994,With such small numbers it’s impossible to firmly establish a connection.
995,It seems likely based on a known rare side effect of DNA vaccines but is no more than a correlation at the moment
996,"Could also be tripping out on power, lord of his small kingdom of muscle-heads"
997,"Believe whatever you want, but keep in mind that the virus is constantly mutating."
998,"Hopefully it won't get worse than it already is, but there is a real chance that new variations will emerge which are more capable of infecting and more dangerous to children."
999,"The facts will change as time progresses, so it's good to keep your eyes open to the latest data and avoid *absolute* statements like ""COVID will do nothing to your kids""."
1000,"(adding a ""probably"" in there would have improved your statement)

The statistics in Germany might be good, but as you can see in the article I linked above, ""0.58% of Brazil's 345,287 Covid deaths to date have been of 0-9 year olds - but that is more than 2,000 children."""
1001,"If the newer variants in Brazil spread to other countries (and they probably will), the situation will likely worsen."
1002,"Canada's population is 38 million, it's not ""a few million""."
1003,"Canada produces airplanes and other advanced things, expecting them to manufacture vaccines isn't unreasonable."
1004,"They just felt that it was advantageous to them to sell off their manufacturing facilities to private entities and make money, and are now crying foul that other countries (specifically the US) aren't prioritizing Canada ahead of their own citizens."
1005,The UK didn't have much manufacturing capacity but realized it would need it and invested heavily last year.
1006,What did Canada do?
1007,Nothing.
1008,"&gt;To understand the problem, we need to go back to the 1980s."
1009,"At that time, the government-owned Connaught Labs was producing vaccines here in Canada and decision-making was in the public realm."
1010,But Connaught was partially privatized and then finally allowed to be sold to the French company Merieux (now part of Sanofi) by the Conservative government of Brian Mulroney.
1011,"&gt;Fast forward to the 2000s, when Québec-based vaccine manufacturer IAF BioChem went through a couple of sales and ended up being owned by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)."
1012,https://theconversation.com/the-roots-of-canadas-covid-19-vaccine-shortage-go-back-decades-154792
1013,"No, they should be way more worried about that."
1014,Worrying about life threatening vaccine complications is like worrying about getting struck by lightning.
1015,But I really doubt anyone actually thinks that (about the vaccine) and if they do it’s not coming from a place of reason.
1016,Does anyone have any data on masks for people who work in a healthcare setting but have no patient contact?
1017,I work in healthcare (admin) and do not have patient contact.
1018,I am new to the job and have not been given any specific guidelines.
1019,I was wearing a cloth mask when I came in on my first day and my boss didn't say anything.
1020,She personally doesn't wear a mask unless someone is actually talking to her at her desk.
1021,I work in a room with maybe one other person.
1022,"I walk through the hospital once a night, but do not enter any patient rooms or interact with any patients or other employees."
1023,"Employees that I do see wear masks, but I am not in contact with them."
1024,A coworker told me off for wearing a cloth mask and said that it wasn't safe.
1025,There is no guideline that I know of and no one has said anything other than this one person.
1026,I can't find and good data about whether or not wearing a cloth mask is reasonable with no patient interactions or contact.
1027,Imagine being THIS racist.
1028,Sorry didn’t add that- I did contact my GP straight away and I’ve been referred to various consultants.
1029,"It’s an ongoing issue it seems, I don’t want to go into too much detail because of anti vaxxers."
1030,I suppose I was more surprised that no one had contacted me.
1031,Gp also reported it
1032,"&gt;""I think we get to 150 million vaccines."
1033,"I think we struggle to get to 160 million,""

Obviously he means 150M fully vaccinated since we're about to hit 200M vaccines already."
1034,"Since he's on the board at Pfizer, I hope they're not planning to cut us off when we get to those numbers...."
1035,"Anyway, this is preposterous."
1036,I'm pretty sure we'll get to at least 70% vaccinated and probably more.
1037,When all is said and done it will be closer to 90% than 50%.
1038,i’m just some dickhead on the internet but reading the tea leaves i get a sense we won’t see that type of stuff until the end of summer if that.
1039,"in my state we’re projected to be around 50% fully vaccinated in june, 70% by a little after july 4th (know all this could change) and knowing how wishy-washy (but cautious for good reason) the folks are who are setting the guidelines/looking at their recent language of “just keep at it, we gotta see,” i have a real hard time seeing any sort of normalcy return in early summer but hope to be wrong."
1040,"i mean even at the most basic level, something along the lines of “ok, you sacrificed for over a year for the good of the vulnerable, if you did your part and got the vaccine and waited two weeks, go live life again!” more resoundingly would be nice and literally seems like exactly what people need to hear but we’re just now still learning how long these vaccines provide protection and it seems like a lot still to learn about what the spread looks like as more and more people get vaccinated."
1041,i can’t see people (at least in chicago where i live) giving their blessing to go all-out back into the world of massive street fests if it’s contrary to cdc guidance and i don’t see cdc guidance being that forgiving for a long time.
1042,again really hope to be wrong and if someone has an opposite take on this i am all ears!
1043,i’ve been a good sport w all this shit but that “small gatherings” wishy washy language is starting to piss me off.
1044,give folks a conservative date by which the vulnerable population we all just had to lock down for will have had adequate vaccinations and let people assume some risk for themselves.
1045,i get they have to slow play it incrementally to see how #s look and any longer term implications and trends but it’s fuckin annoying lol
1046,Whether it’s a good idea or not people aren’t going back.
1047,Once summer hits?
1048,Forget it.
1049,"It doesn’t matter if it’s a good idea or not, it’s the reality."
1050,Got my second Moderna dose at 9am PST.
1051,Currently 7:30PM PST with zero major symptoms except a sore arm.
1052,"&gt; Anyway, because of this different coverage you can't use US and UK data to compare Pfizer and AZ."
1053,"Agree, but the hysterical reaction against AZ is perplexing when the UK has the biggest sample size for the world to see results from."
1054,"Get the pamphlets out to the meth dealers, weed growers, food stamp people, and include a coupon for a free pint of spirits, problem solved."
1055,It's almost as if roughly half of older new yorkers have been vaccinated...
1056,"When I tried to get the vaccine, I was told I needed to provide my health insurance card, which I don't have and the lady was like sorry, but we need your insurance."
1057,So to say I walked out pissed is an understatement.
1058,My Walgreens wanted insurance.
1059,[removed]
1060,Imagine being able to get a vaccine?
1061,My state still not available.
1062,Wow!
1063,Still trying to persuade my 50 yr brother who is a free rider ( everyone else in the family is vaccinated)
1064,"I'm really curious how they came up with this number - if 7 million were questioned or prompted if they would take the vaccine if it's free, wouldn't the surveyors tell the participants that the vaccine is free after the questionnaire thus invalidating this entire claim?"
1065,Yea I just edited my comment to add yet.
1066,I’m going to get the vaccine but There’s no reason for me to rush in and be another test subject.
1067,Surely they would only do this with knowledge that they have speedy access to enough mRNA.
1068,Isn't not dying the goal though?
1069,[deleted]
1070,How hard is it to google shit??
1071,"“Hmmmm, I’d like to get the vaccine but I wonder if it cost anything?” - 30 seconds later I find the answer on a government sponsored website saying it’s free regardless if you have health insurance or not."
1072,What about it?
1073,[deleted]
1074,Are you saying you don’t believe the data?
1075,It’s just made up?
1076,Luckily the easily-googleable statistics on just how low the risk of serious illness from covid in children holds true regardless of what mean names u/Bongs-Akimbo calls u/mangomochi567 on Reddit
1077,Only thing I see is claims by the thoroughly discredited Rebekah Jones.
1078,"OK, thanks for clarifying."
1079,"I still believe from the many medical professionals in my social network who work in hospitals across Japan that it is accurate to say they are overwhelmed (and heavily overworked), but I guess it depends on how you look at the data."
1080,This post appears to be about vaccines.
1081,"We encourage you to read our helpful resources on the COVID-19 vaccines:

1082,Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) if you have any questions or concerns.
1083,*
1084,Yeah that's a huge no from me dog.
1085,We don't even know if the vaccine is effective after 6 months...
1086,I stand corrected.
1087,I am happy you are right.
1088,"In a thread about how a whole country stopped using a vacine due to the health concerns, no less."
1089,"Can't have a guy share his opinion that maybe it's not wise to use something so unpredictable right now, if there are alternatives, nope."
1090,Now you're going on about Iraq?
1091,Dude.
1092,Seek help.
1093,"When you increase vaccinations in other age groups, I think this tends to happen."
1094,"Someone at my job asked me how much I was paying to get the vaccine, around $500?"
1095,I was gobsmacked.
1096,"Ok honest question here, I don’t see this talked about anywhere but there are news articles all over about needing to reach 80% vaccination rates to reach herd immunity."
1097,However no one ever adds already infected into this number.
1098,Doesn’t this mean with current known infections and the 40-60% asymptomatic cases AND current vaccinations that we a much closer to herd immunity ?
1099,I honestly don’t understand why infections aren’t included in this number if natural antibodies are just as good as vaccines.
1100,This is insane to me.
1101,It's almost like having a bunch of kids spending extended time with each other exacerbates the spread of infectious disease.
1102,Last I looked was the day the governor was inviting other states to come over.
1103,I can’t find the exact quote but he opened it up fully on the 7th.
1104,"https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-prem-mass-vaccination-site-gary-roosevelt-high-school-tt-0413-20210414-w72si2wuovfthbbg2avk2lvhha-story.html%3foutputType=amp

So you’ve had tons of people jumping to Indiana to get shots."
1105,I know when I looked at the Gary site it was wide open with appointments.
1106,Shortly after that is when the Chicago news pushed the story.
1107,"If you’re having a hard time now, it’s probably because you’re fighting out of state people."
1108,I tried vegan.
1109,Felt awful and added in fish and seafood felt much better immediately.
1110,That’s what I’ve heard.
1111,"I’m feeling a little drowsy, kind of like after you take a Claritin, and the sore arm."
1112,"Hints of other things, but all very faint."
1113,"If it only takes you 2 hours to get shot then they can only give you two, it’s just up to 4 not minimum."
1114,At least in my state
1115,"My understanding is that Merced had 10.1 per 100000 cases, so they petitioned Tuesday to make an exception since they were just .1 off and were just accepted today, after the original statewide update."
1116,For most people?
1117,Yes.
1118,We'll take those doses off your hands please and thanks
1119,You do realize this is how it has always been right?
1120,There are places that are allowed 50% capacity but can not actually get to that number because of the size and layout of their space right now.
1121,"What do you expect them to say ""we are opening up to a percentage of capacity that is unique to every location based on their space, layout and function that does not at all correlate with our plans which are to just say that percent of capacity is no longer a restriction but social distancing is""??"
1122,most people understand that 100% capacity means capacity is no longer the restriction.
1123,Just like when they opened for indoor dining but still have mask rules.
1124,"Practically speaking you can't, but you can get sued/fired for it later if your employer finds out you lied somehow."
1125,To me it just feels awkward to be unmasked and enjoy the services of someone who potentially wants the vaccine but couldn’t secure an appointment yet.
1126,"As somebody who’s had to sell lottery tickets to germy people who would sacrifice their lives for scratch offs this entire pandemic, I prefer to limit unnecessary customer service interaction until the pandemic is over."
1127,"I order plenty of take out, and these guys have enough bullshit to worry about without wondering if my maskless mouth is vaccinated"
1128,Diet matters too.
1129,If you exercise on a shitty diet you’ll still feel like shit and the exercise itself will be harder and less enjoyable.
1130,It’s got nothing to do with lib or con.
1131,The same thing happened in the build up to the Iraq war.
1132,"A bunch of gutless cowards, who were mostly not libs, bought into the lies that the WMDs are real and we had to go to war."
1133,"Then when the invasion happened and it was proven that there were no WMDs they said “oh we didn’t know.” Well how did I know, then?"
1134,Same with this.
1135,"People joining in the frenzy and then at the end they say “we didn’t know.” So how did I know, then?"
1136,"I can't imagine how one would prove lack of vaccination, not gonna lie, lol."
1137,...or you're just an idiot.
1138,Good luck...
1139,The two flights I just took were jam packed.
1140,Not a single available spot on the plane.
1141,The airports were also PACKED.
1142,absolutely packed
1143,"While I don’t believe it should be mandatory, I’m pro-vaccination and have been getting my flu shot every year for my children, so I don’t really have much to argue with that."
1144,👍🏼
1145,My symptoms started after about 6-7 hours.
1146,"The first 12 hours were the toughest with body aches and fatigue and then it got better, though I was pretty fatigued for about 24 hours."
1147,"You don't pay either way, but your insurance company will pay for you if you do have insurance instead of the government covering it."
1148,Spread the message.
1149,That's why they ask for insurance if you have it.
1150,Vitamin D too.
1151,Our moronic species also avoids the sun and doesn’t supplement.
1152,That's better than the US.
1153,"The CDC is still trying to beg people to wear ineffective cloth masks, and at best ""double mask"" (which the communication on that is terrible \[cloth+surgeons is what they recommend media is saying ""double mask everything"" \[which creates problems\])"
1154,Ah that sucks.
1155,I live in murica where its been a mad dash free for all.
1156,"I had to hunt for a while, and I'll have to drive 3 hours away but I found pfizer vaccines for my whole family."
1157,"Israel and Chile don’t manufacture their own vaccines, nor do most of the other 38 countries ahead of Canada in vaccine rates."
1158,Canada waited too long and bet on the wrong horse when they made a move.
1159,Yes being in good physical shape also helps our mental state.
1160,Many people don’t get this and seek out depression and anxiety medications which only mask the problem.
1161,My employer has recommended that we get it on our day off with a full second day off.
1162,I'm not sure if it is paid or not though.
1163,Of course the $100 bonus pretty much covers lost work time.
1164,I work claims for a major insurer in the USA.
1165,"I’ve seen claims come through where the vaccine itself is billed for $0.00, but the administration of the vaccine is billed separately for various amounts and we pay a small amount on that line."
1166,So if places can bill insurance for the administration they’re going to.
1167,But government is paying for vaccine itself.
1168,That’s what I’m seeing anyway.
1169,Healthcare/ Insurance stuff isn’t ever as straightforward as it should be.
1170,"No, it probably inches upward."
1171,Dose two is primarily an attempt to make it last longer.
1172,"No, protection will continue to increase, whether you have one dose or two."
1173,See the UK.
1174,Fine.
1175,"If Covid mutates into Captain Trips, we’re all doomed anyways."
1176,"If you’d like to live your life expecting and hiding from all of the most outrageous worst-case possibilities that you can imagine, well, all I can say is, good luck with that."
1177,"For those who’ve had a second Moderna shot, two questions: 1) did any of you have equal or less intense symptoms after your second shot?"
1178,2) how long did it take for the intense symptoms to kick in?
1179,"I had my second dose 10 hours ago and, so far, as the kids would say, “this edible ain’t shit.”"
1180,I’m still gonna get it but I’m not in a huge rush.
1181,Definitely not rushing to get AstraZeneca.
1182,"i mean, if it was a problem with moderna or pfizer."
1183,it would shown up by now.
1184,The risk is so absolutely minuscule that any side effects she experiences are far more likely to be unrelated to clotting.
1185,She’s in fact more likely to get a clot unrelated to the vaccine.
1186,Just a heads up to not stress too much if she gets leg pain or something
1187,If you have insurance they'll still bill you for things like covid tests and vaccines.
1188,"The point is that you won't have to pay, but the government wants insurance companies to pay for those they cover."
1189,"Yep, one of those things that your brain says, ""you are statistically totally okay, and you should not worry at all."
1190,.
1191,".^^you ^^should ^^worry ^^because ^^she ^^could ^^totally ^^die ^^and ^^you ^^will ^^grieve ^^for ^^the ^^rest ^^of ^^your ^^miserable ^^life."""
1192,Stupid monkey brain.
1193,Thank you.
1194,"I did some Googling after your reply, and I see that the insurance company is in the wrong."
1195,I'll sort this out.
1196,"The $37ish charge isn't a hardship or anything, but it's about the principle."
1197,And it causes people like me to initially spread the narrative that the shot isn't free.
1198,I'm sure that doesn't help.
1199,Thank you.
1200,"I did some Googling after your reply, and I see that the insurance company is in the wrong."
1201,I'll sort this out.
1202,"The $37ish charge isn't a hardship or anything, but it's about the principle."
1203,And it causes people like me to initially spread the narrative that the shot isn't free.
1204,I'm sure that doesn't help.
1205,By lying about your insurance status you took an action in bad faith that resulted in financial loss for walgreens.
1206,As you caused that loss through malicious action it would be 100% liability.
1207,You've had your period for 16 days because of getting the vaccine?
1208,?
1209,I think people keep discounting how much natural immunity already exists at this point.
1210,It’s has to be more than double the 30mil confirmed positive cases at this point.
1211,That goes a long way towards herd immunity with help of vaccines
1212,We have enough vaccines right now.
1213,"In my area, they’re doing large events where no appointment is necessary— people can walk in and get vaxxed."
1214,And some doses are still going unused.
1215,The problem is “vaccine hesitancy” among adults.
1216,It is way too high right now.
1217,"If it continues for, say, four more months, there won’t be enough time to get enough people fully vaxxed before school starts."
1218,"As I said, the future can’t be predicted."
1219,"But unless a miracle happens, that’s how I see it."
1220,Why do I feel like Foo Fighters are always involved in this shit?
1221,It’s like they are Tom Hanks of rock bands.
1222,They usually are practically brain dead
1223,"Yeah, it's location dependent."
1224,I live in an area with some of the lowest hesitancy in the country (good!)
1225,and they haven't fully opened the floodgates (they did lower the BMI threshold to 25 so a lot of adults qualified starting April 5th).
1226,"Then it'll take a few weeks to get appointments for some people, then 1 month+ between first shot and fully vaccinated, especially for the Moderna folks."
1227,"So it might be more end of June, though by then cases might be so low that it might not matter as much anyways."
1228,"There's also the complicating fact of the missing J&amp;J, as that was being used for a lot of community clinics and was plan A for vaccinating those without homes, etc."
1229,"So for some, it being off the table will be a major problem."
1230,"I mean AD viral vectors up till the Ebola vaccine were used for gene therapy applications, where they used the viruses to deliver genes."
1231,"The last I heard about them was their usage to treat cystic fibrosis patients, which didn't go that well."
1232,How/why would they possibly sue you for that

1237,"Not to mention, the AD viral vector will loose effectiveness the more booster shots you give to a patient unlike a lipid nanoparticle that elicits no immune response."
1238,"I got mine at a Walgreens too, but they did ask for my insurance card."
1239,"&gt;More people will die of Covid from us being down a vaccine than can even come close to dying from the vaccine

you can't really say that... with this hitting a particular demographic harder (youngish women)... you could have a situation where taking the vaccine is more dangerous for this segment than actually catching covid...

you don't know that until you assess it... which is what they are doing... it could turn out  that these women just gave birth or on birth control.... or have another disease or other medication....

we're trying to find out.... and once we do we will have more confidence in the safety profile... right now you would be asking people to assess risk with incomplete information...

we can do better than that... especially when we have other vaccines and especially when we can unpause with better understood parameters around people taking the jnj or oxford vaccine so they have a better safety profile.... 

if we wind up pausing jnj for a month... that's not really slowing much down... the risk is if we don't administer jnj at all... but in that scenario we would be having larger revelations than what we are having now and confidence in it would be low.... we're nowhere near that yet...."
1240,Sure as shit doesn't help when CVS requires insurance info if you say you have insurance.
1241,"This is marketing 101 - put ""BOTH VACCINES ARE FREE"" on every single form/page no matter what."
1242,Most people are not reading articles about this like Reddit is.
1243,Well I live in the UK too and what I outlined above has been my general impression.
1244,"Certainly there's an element to what you're saying about the messaging, but that's the case in most countries."
1245,It doesn't help that they ask for your insurance info when booking an appointment.
1246,Will “100 more days” become the new “two more weeks”?
1247,Stay tuned
1248,Send them to meeeeeeeeeeeeee...
1249,"&gt; So like I said in another post, are you going to worry about your neighbors getting the flu shot every year?"
1250,"Yes, I absolutely believe that we should do more in regards to getting the population vaccinated."
1251,"If primary and secondary schools required it for attendance, I wouldn't bat an eye."
1252,"If employers started paying $100 to employee's who got the influenza shot, I'd be happy."
1253,If employers started requiring it for employment?
1254,Works for me.
1255,"If public employers negotiating it into their agreements with unions that influenza vaccination was mandatory, that would receive kudos from me."
1256,A federal or state government wanted to use tax dollars to make the influenza vaccine free for everyone?
1257,Full support from me.
1258,"As a society, we don't take influenza seriously enough."
1259,We should do more and I have hope that maybe we can work on some mRNA vaccines for influenza that can be produced with lower lead times than the current egg-based production so that scientists can more accurately predict the likely strains.
1260,"With higher efficacies, I think we'll get more people willing to get influenza shots and we would be able to reduce the loss of life from influenza."
1261,"&gt;If you get the vaccine, go to Disney and live your life happily finally and forget about the pandemic."
1262,And if Disney decides they want to require everyone to get a vaccine before coming...
1263,They should be allowed to do that.
1264,That's what you told me.
1265,Because that's actually where the discussion started.
1266,It didn’t reach your brain cold!
1267,"Lol
That sensation of cold is part of the vasovagal response not the tiny bit of lukewarm vaccine."
1268,Vaccines are warmed prior to being given.

1270,"I want it so bad, I have insurance, good-great insurance(according to a relative that worked in a doctors office for 40 years I have go over my benefits with me to help me better understand it) through the Fortune 500 company I work for."
1271,"I still have to pay all kinds of copays, hidden lab fees, the pain of searching for a doctor in your neck work, fucking LAB FEES that even when they are charged they don’t notify you how much or even if they aren’t covered until you get them back, I can’t get the mental health medication that works the best for me because there isn’t a generic for another few years and the brand name costs 250 for 30 pills AFTER my insurance so I take an older drug that attempts to accomplish the same but is much worse at it, I would be terrified to go to the emergency room for anything and would only take ambulance if I were really really close to dying and I still know I would be in debt forever if I ever go through a car wreck or something."
1272,Medicine in America while on the bleeding edge technologically is so utterly ratfucked that even people with great insurance get fucked unless you’re in the one percent because it’s a scam.
1273,The people that are against it baffle me.
1274,I can’t imagine being happy with you’re health insurance in any way.
1275,It just needs to be a service
1276,One might also point out children were in school in 2019
1277,"Funny how the people crying ""what about mental health from lockdowns"" are the same people who refuse to support improved mental healthcare or, more immediately better covid testing that would allow for less strict lockdowns"
1278,I would say this one dominates in places where there were large scale infections already.
1279,In Delhi we barely got impacted by b117 but this is fast growing.
1280,And even if you don't have any suprises your deductible still might be 1/3 of your yearly take home pay so you just never go to the doctor.
1281,But I sure am glad I get to keep this plan!
1282,No way do I want M4A
1283,Sinopharm and CoronaVac (from China) and Covaxin (from India) are also inactivated vaccines.
1284,[removed]
1285,"I don't think this is the case, talking as a UK resident."
1286,"The message has always been the vaccines are a path out of this, the vaccine is better than no vaccine and the risk of the side effects is lower than the risk of covid."
1287,That message has not changed.
1288,From my perspective the NHS doesn't come into it.
1289,"We know that all adults in the US will be able to get a highly effective vaccine by May

We also know that risk of serious illness from covid is extremely low in children

The two combined are enough to make decision about schooling in the fall

Unless you’re saying you don’t believe the data on vaccine efficacy?"
1290,Or don’t believe the data on how low of a risk covid is to children?
1291,Or don’t believe that we will have enough vaccines in the US for every adult very soon?
1292,No?
1293,But you can’t force children to take something that isn’t fully approved.
1294,I’m about as pro vaccine as you can get
1295,It's purely a problem of bad incentives.
1296,"Regulators care more about deaths they more directly cause than deaths they allow to happen, potentially by 10-1000 times as much."
1297,"The deaths they could have prevented, are never specifically identified so there is no victims when they allow them to happen."
1298,"But when they sign off on a drug that kills someone, there is a very easily identifiable victim."
1299,"What that means is we need regulators  that will put public safety ahead of their own personal image, but this is hard and it is easy for regulators to weasel out by claiming they don't have enough data (there is never perfect data, they are experts so they can use their judgement in the face of imperfect data, if there was perfect data we would not need experts opinions.)"
1300,Stop lying!
1301,You are openly anti-vaxx and covid denier.
1302,Why should we trust anything spews from your lying mouth?
1303,BECAUSE EVERY GOOGLE SEARCH TELLS YOU IT COSTS MONEY.
1304,"When they first brought up the COVID virus, I causally mentioned to my employer that the only way I would get it is if it was free."
1305,I got my first shot last week.
1306,&gt;Canada has wack jobs too.
1307,"They seem to be concentrated in that vast nothingness between Alberta and Inland BC 

Don't worry, we have them everywhere... Just generally not enough to meet critical mass and be significant players outside of those areas."
1308,Stupidity is a human condition and knows no borders.
1309,"This is based on E-health records, so as I understand it, is just based on people with COVID."
1310,This is why each country must make it's own decision based on the scale of the pandemic within their borders.
1311,"In Brazil, for example, it's much more likely that you will catch COVID and then be subject to this higher risk than in Denmark, which is why the latter has suspended the AZ vaccine for now."
1312,“Doctors hate this one thing that helps in the sharing and gaining of knowledge”.
1313,Dude it’s literally the first sentence of the article.
1314,I get it it’s tough to read a lot of articles but how pathetic have we become that if the answer isn’t in a quip we don’t have time to find it?
1315,"&gt;	Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, says the recommended pause on the Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid-19 vaccine is just that: a pause -- and not a cancellation -- and will likely last days to weeks."
1316,"I think the cdc needs to start making appeals to the ""this needs to start ending"" group."
1317,Wearing 2 masks outdoors after being fully vaccinated is a poor place to be at right now.
1318,"They should make a suggestion of ""if you're vaccinated you dont have to wear a masks outdoors."""
1319,"I think a alotta states will take that as a sign that they are willing to give them a bone instead of states like NH where the governor is like ""well CDC isnt making forward progress on this at all so I guess I will."""
1320,"“Harm reduction” is the idea that overly restrictive recommendations lead to low compliance and, paradoxically, spreading the virus faster, because humanity has a limited amount of patience."
1321,"We learned this (slowly, painfully) during the AIDS crisis."
1322,"Obviously the only *real* way to end the spread of AIDS would be for mass abstinence, but that’s not going to happen."
1323,"And as soon as people started figuring that out, they threw all caution to the wind and started having risky sex, because “virus gonna virus” (sound familiar?)."
1324,"Eventually, the medical establishment realized that normalizing condom use and regular HIV testing, while less than ideal, was a lot easier for regular people to follow, which led to much higher compliance, which is what helped slow the contagion enough for treatments to be developed."
1325,"Widespread extended lockdown is the only way to stop COVID in its tracks, but it’s simply too hard for a lot of people to comply with."
1326,"We can debate whose fault that is, we can rage at how selfish people are, but it’s a true statement of fact."
1327,Widespread extended lockdown is simply too hard for a lot of people to comply with.
1328,"Knowing what we know about harm reduction, we could have said “obviously staying home is the safest course of action, but here’s other stuff you can do to slow down the spread of COVID” (including and especially masks) and allowed schools, businesses, and entertainments to reopen at limited capacity after the first two or three weeks of lockdowns, we would have had a much higher rate of compliance and COVID wouldn’t have spread as fast or as far as it did."
1329,"Instead, we have a bunch of people who believe that “virus gonna virus”, because they’ve been led to believe that the only things they can do to stop COVID are things they personally find too difficult to comply with, so they abandon *all* preventive measures, including masks."
1330,We could have kept less effective preventive measures going into 2022 with a high rate of compliance.
1331,Instead we have significant numbers of people pushing for zero compliance beginning with last summer.
1332,What does that have to do with anything?
1333,Its an f'ing pandemic.
1334,Please don't start telling me its a hoax or any bs like that.
1335,I'm a little torn on this.
1336,"Sure it makes sense to get people out asap and get society going again, but lets not forget that the young population has been kept at home for over a year to save the boomers."
1337,"Boomers are the first in the vaccine que, and they will get these passports sooner."
1338,So where are the rewards for the young population in all this?
1339,He’s saying that so that people don’t start flaunting the remaining rules that remain in place.
1340,It’s not really the same; you don’t even use AZ and you are far ahead into the vaccination campaign with enough output to compensate j&amp;j supply.
1341,"“May”

Also, Earth “may” be obliterated by a giant asteroid tomorrow"
1342,"You can't calculate fatality rate like that, it makes no sense."
1343,It makes even less sense to compare it directly to the real fatality rate of covid.
1344,"Nah most of the EU countries were vaccinating general population with AZ and vaccination health care workers with biontech 

They have orders lined up with biontech for 2022 but current orders are not that large in comparison to their AZ orders"
1345,Do you live in south africa and brazil?
1346,Go look into israel's green pass.
1347,It's a one time authentication through a blockchain.
1348,It's pretty simple actually.
1349,And you could easily have it attached to airline tickets and venue tickets
1350,Thanks for the answer!

1352,"&gt;In over 480,000 people receiving a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (Pfizer or Moderna), CVT occurred in 4 in a million."
1353,CVT has been reported to occur in about 5 in a million people after first dose of the AZ-Oxford COVID-19 vaccine.
1354,Massive CI but is this saying the mRNA vaccines may be having the exact same problem?
1355,"If it's the German plant supplying the extra, that's a Biontech facility."

1368,"So yeah...unironically that thing you said, because it was never an A/B choice and it's time to admit that."
1369,Explain?
1370,I literally deal with patients all day who lost their medicare benefits because social security thinks they died.
1371,Our government can't do shit right.

1379,"If you live in the United States and have been waiting for your turn to get vaccinated, it's your turn."

1381,At least try.
1382,The vaccine is free.
1383,"If you don't have insurance, it's still free."
1384,It's free.
1385,"I understand some people aren't eligible yet, but you are likely eligible on the 19th, which is Monday."
1386,Don’t depend on your local pharmacy to have a dose for you.
1387,There are likely more appointments available at your nearest mass vaccination sites.
1388,"Both of the mass vaccination sites I've been to are absolutely top notch, well run, clean and efficient."
1389,The Walgreens I took a relative to was not.
1390,FWIW it’s very anecdotal but the few people I know who had covid and are now fully vaxxed all said they experienced worse symptoms after dose 1 than dose 2
1391,Also iirc they supplied the missed doses a few weeks later.
1392,Do you mean states that have been underreporting cases and deaths?
1393,Postmaster general is appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate.
1394,To compare them to ups or fedex is stupid.
1395,&gt;most of it was focused on AZ vaccines.
1396,Huh?
1397,"It wasn't apart from the UK, which isn't EU."
1398,Ok but the US did shove a bunch of money into Pfizer and Moderna.
1399,What’s the argument here?
1400,That Canada chose to sit out the bidding process but now it’s incumbent upon the US to help them jump the line because reasons?
1401,I buy 2 seats when I travel.

1404,Too late.

1407,"Well, they happened and no state did anything about it."

1409,Germany should based on delivery infos even without J&amp;J and AZ afaik.
1410,"I thought that to, like it should be a Black Friday type first come first serve register on site."
1411,But I think it's more political.
1412,"I know most states re-opening language is tied to an ""available vaccine""."
1413,I think if they open it up that technically the vaccine is available and they would be forced to open up the state.
1414,I guess not forced but legally there could be business lawsuits around it.
1415,No I can't.
1416,Tried.
1417,Won't let me.
1418,Not in the age criteria yet.
1419,USA too.
1420,We have morons who stand behind misinformation and spread lies through social media.
1421,I'm not a Canadian but in the US that would be difficult to do.
1422,Serving liquor without a license is a criminal violation and cops enforce criminal code.
1423,Health code violations are usually civil matters which cops usually don't get involved in unless/until things snake through the courts and there are court orders to enforce.
1424,"You can still get infected after two full doses, just much more likely."
1425,We had around 6000 such cases in Poland among only 2M vaccinated.
1426,Seems a lot but it was calculated to show around 80% efficacy for the vaccines (we use AZ and Pfizer).
1427,I agree with you that's a fair point; I'm just pointing out eveyone making that fair point should realize the policy implications of that point
1428,It means the virus is firmly established in a country that doesn't have the resources to treat the cases.
1429,"The Marburg plant is just Biontech afaik, not Pfizer."
1430,Though they use a Pfizer plant to fill &amp; finish.
1431,The pause is to allow time to get the right treatment information to clinicians.
1432,This rare type of clot can’t be treated with normal blood thinners - it actually makes it worse.

1438,lockdown for u!
1439,for me !
1440,for everyone!
1441,lets lockdown for another yr.
1442,Definitely better to not talk about it and let providers scramble to treat these patients.
1443,Who cares about young healthy people dying?
1444,"Lol, what science is that?"
1445,"I think they're damned if they do, damned if they don't."

1467,It has supposedly killed a 48 year old women today so at best I suspect that age could be raised.
1468,Lol it was literally snowing in London earlier this week.
1469,"I don’t understand why six people in six million (J&amp;J,) is this much of a concern."
1470,Seems like the virus is much more dangerous.
1471,Using a balance of risks approach and the data we have available as the general public this seems to be very much the wrong call.
1472,Covid is far more dangerous than this shot is.
1473,"To be consistent, they should probably ban the birth control pill as well, which also elevates clot risk."
1474,It’s as if there are 50 billion reasons to kill non-profit vaccines.
1475,Because I thought it was strange to get all my insurance info and verify it just for a waitlist.
1476,"Sure get it from me when the appointment becomes available, I understand that."
1477,I wound up getting an appointment at another hospital where they took my info at the appointment.
1478,"&gt; What we do know is that the vaccine is safe

We don't know this, though."
1479,I'm am American citizen in Kenya - we can't get the shot :: basically we're being told to hope the Kenyan government gets it sh$t together and depend on them for the vacinne.
1480,Wish I was stateside right now
1481,"&gt; Without the vaccine, I’m pretty sure it would have been a death sentence for my aunt and uncle given their health issues and age."
1482,"It's never a death sentence, at most you get 33% chance of death."
1483,So everyone is going to be taking laughing gas (NO is laughing gas).
1484,There’s going to be a run on Whip-Its
1485,Because nothing involving the health of the working class is literally NEVER free in America.
1486,You're gonna pay somewhere.
1487,So why would this be any different?
1488,"I see that now, but I was just saying it’s been on the news too about the fee."

1490,34 year old living in Japan.
1491,Please ship one for me.
1492,Why?
1493,We've seen in numerous states that lifting the statewide mandate didn't result in case explosion.
1494,Yeah mine only took about 30 minutes total including the drive to the local pharmacy.
1495,I was in and out in under 10 minutes.
1496,"When they asked what questions I had about the vaccine, my only question was which one I was getting, just so I would know."
1497,But I’m sure they get some real doozies.
1498,&gt; Eventually all kids are going to have to be vaccinated in order to attend school.
1499,Unless over the next 18-24 months we see pathogenic priming in vaccinated individuals.
1500,I've pulled this for politics because the title focuses on one single (political) aspect of the Quinnipiac poll.
1501,Please feel free to resubmit an article that covers the poll results more holistically.
1502,Also some nurses hold the vial wrong.
1503,They hold the glass when they should hold the metal part.

1505,There's already a system set in place to compensate vaccine injuries.
1506,&gt;what has been done to address this?
1507,Nothing.
1508,It is unbelievable.

1520,"Current takw of this sub is: don't suggest that hospitalizatiins and deaths can still occur among the vaccinated just at a much lower rate since trials showed 100% protection against hospitalisations it must be 100%, not 90 or 94% lile real life data suggests."

1526,"Stupid, you know what reduces the risk of spread of covid on airplanes?"
1527,Temporarily lower the number of planes flying until this pandemic is over.
1528,It's free to the consumer not free completely.
1529,If we didn't charge insurance the feds would have to pay more money and the whole thing would be a LOT more expensive to american taxpayers then doing it this way
1530,Because this will directly lead to people dying.

1532,You people are honestly mental.
1533,Do you let your kids swim?
1534,Do you let your kids be driven in private vehicles?

1536,Life is dangerous.
1537,"You can mitigate the risks, but eliminating the risk is a lot harder."
1538,"I know some of them were on hospital workers who are definitely exposed, but yeah, it's a lot of guess work."
1539,Pfizer/Moderna and AZ/J&amp;J aren't comparable due to the different technologies they are made of.
1540,Production of mRNA vaccines is much more reliable than the one of live vector ones.
1541,On what age group?
1542,"It's very clear that if you take the population as a whole, the benefits of AstraZeneca outweights the risks, as the virus is really deadly for old and at-risk patients."
1543,No one but anti-vaxxers can doubt that.
1544,"The real question is wether, say, a 20-year-old female (or even a 35-year-old male in a low-incidence country) should be offered it."
1545,"In Ontario they opened it up to 55+, and they're now targeting high risk neighborhoods, although I don't think they actually have the supply to do it, so it's likely still just 55+."
1546,"It's quite disgusting really, the US has the benefit of manufacturing itself and has banned exports to Canada."
1547,"We've only been getting trickles from EU, India, and South Korea."
1548,It seems that our government made some big bets early on that in hindsight were all wrong.
1549,We've purchased more vaccines per capita than any other nation yet weren't able to negotiate early delivery.
1550,Why?
1551,their God Trump had it.
1552,wasn't fauci in charge of that too?
1553,how can they weigh the risks themselves if we have no idea what's causing it?
1554,we're effectively in a phase 4 .... if these side effects were happening in the trial they would be pausing too to understand the side effects better ...
1555,"7 weeks delay, but it means another summer with heavy restrictions."
1556,I think that’s why the government is not completely ruling out using adenovirus vaccines in the future.
1557,Sigh.
1558,This is going to cause a lot of anxiety.
1559,Neither this article nor the linked study provide any age/demographic/sex information about the mRNA vaccine recipients who reportedly experienced CVT.
1560,There's also no information about how long this CVT risk is.
1561,"Are you in the clear after a certain amount of time, or will the incidence rate climb as more time passes?"
1562,P1 has been attacking younger patients with a vengeance.
1563,See Brazil.
1564,It's actually more likely the opposite.
1565,Just one thing: The Canadian system is also cheaper in *tax dollars per capita*.
1566,You do not have to raise taxes for universal health care.
1567,[The damage has already been done to the J&amp;J vaccine's reputation.
1568,](https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2021/04/15/johnson-johnson-vaccine-confidence) We went from 26% of people thinking it was unsafe before the pause to 39% after (+14%!).
1569,They saw the exact same thing with the AZ vaccine in Europe.
1570,"I hope that the Moderna and Pfizer don't get drug down with the J&amp;J, and that people start thinking it's safe again after they resume."
1571,14% of Americans is over 45 million people.
1572,"so, over a year of ""we need to protect our healthcare system"" while the government did absolutely nothing to actually help the healthcare system"
1573,I guess attacking someone’s Reddit credentials is a nice default when you have zero argument of your own
1574,I don't think many thought it would really last this long.
1575,But lockdowns only prolonged the pandemic trying to keep hospitals from being overwhelmed.
1576,"Yeah when I said Texas was doing relatively poorly in total vax'd I was going by rank, not by gap."
1577,"As you say, the gap is not all that impressive."
1578,The rankings I got from the NYT vaccine rollout tracker.
1579,Scroll down to the table with all the states.
1580,"click the heading for Fully Vaccinated, and you'll find Texas way, way towards the bottom."

1586,"My comment was removed for ""incivility"""
1587,on top of that in the US we have alternatives where we can allow anyone who wants the vaccine to still get one.... this isn't preventing or slowing down anything when we're pausing for 2-4 weeks... if we only had the adenovirus vaccines i'm sure we would still be continuing jabs....
1588,"Yeah, I too hate when the pandemic breaks their promises."
1589,"Coronavirus said it wouldn't mutate and now it is, what gives?"

1595,Long-term COVID sufferers have been found all over.
1596,7 weeks total delay is what I read if we drop both J&amp;J and AZ.
1597,Not too bad.
1598,Fauci saying this will change approximately zero minds.
1599,The people who tuned him out tuned out ages ago.
1600,This whole mess with Fauci should be taught in public relations classes for eternity.
1601,“How not to message a public health crisis to the public”.
1602,"Yeah, so if anything, it makes the rate of cases among vaccinated people look even better by comparison."
1603,Since the same can be said about the total cases among total population to-date.
1604,"Well, at least it’s outdoor."
1605,"If your data is correct, the only common factor to vaccines and Covid itself is the spike protein."
1606,This whole thing may be unavoidable in some people because your immune system must be exposed to spike to generate immunity to it
1607,Yeah but why deal with the 1 in 4 million odds of developing a blood clot when you can just spend the rest of your life locked indoors to avoid covid and develop a more natural form of heart disease?
1608,?
1609,Just switch to the different chart.
1610,They are based on amount of cases in a particular area.
1611,"Low risk area, medium risk area, and high risk area."
1612,So they do take fluctuating numbers into account.
1613,No vaccine has ever been perfected.
1614,There isn't even a *mechanism* for perfecting a vaccine because there are people without functioning immune systems.

1623,"&gt; Covid just happens to need a high percentage of vaccinations in order to jump start hwrd immunity

What does this even mean?"

1749,"They won't have one, cause contraceptives cause an increased risk in DVT, while Covid and the vaccine have a small boost in cerebral sinus vein thrombosis CVT (head and neck) through completely different mechanisms."
1750,The cause for the CVT is proposed to be similar to the paradox reaction to long term heparin blood thinning: Antibodies against a specific coagulation factor.
1751,While DVT (in the legs) is caused by a multitude of factors that very slightly increase several parameters that boost clotting.
1752,Like reduced blood flow in the veins etc.

1773,"How do you think you're going to find and vaccinate every bat, cat, field mouse, mink, pangolin, etc?"
1774,"And of course, that's assuming you can get it out of humans in the first place, which certainly isn't happening anytime soon."
1775,"Where do you get the idea that this is possible, other than from countries who have *temporarily* done it and continue to have mitigations reimposed because they can't keep it out?"
1776,I’m a pretty big proponent of removing all restrictions once every adult who wants a vaccine has had the chance to be fully vaccinated.
1777,But it’s going to take some time before that happens.
1778,"If we assume that within 3 weeks of the vaccine opening to all adults that all adults who want a first dose have a first dose, and that it takes 5 weeks from the date of your first dose to when you’re 2 weeks past your second dose, that puts you at 8 weeks past April 19th, or June 14th."
1779,I think that’s a good date to drop all restrictions in the US.

1790,They were going to make a green tier but instead decided to throw out the blue print June 15th (but keep masks).
1791,I would recommend &lt; 93 deaths in the US per day for 2-4 weeks.
1792,That number is the 2019 flu deaths.
1793,"The moment it is less deadly than the flu and we think the vaccines are protecting us from having it spike back up, we should be great."
1794,93 = 0.28 deaths per 1M pop.

1819,Unfortunately there are many people who DO think that having a drivers license creates a two tier society.
1820,At least here in the US.
1821,"I mean, people think requiring ID to vote is a form of discrimination."
1822,There are always people who think that any sort of registration or proof of competency or protection is a form of discrimination ~ these people should be ignored.

1830,For most young healthy people covid was never a massive risk.
1831,"Now it's 5% of the previous risk of even getting sick, and maybe 1% of the previous risk of having serious illness or death."
1832,Good enough!
1833,Damn near every patient admitted from my ER with Covid had elevated D-dimer labs.

1842,I’m no anti vaxxer but how on earth is this a good argument?
1843,"I mean, if we are gonna need boosters, won’t that mean we have to do a whole other round of vaccinations even with the ones we’re doing aren’t over?"

1850,That's probably still lower than your chances of catching covid and getting a blood clot from that.

1852,🤷‍♂️
1853,"If vaccine reactions were worse for 2nd dose, can we expect 3rd to be even worse than 2nd?"
1854,"If I can beat this “disease” with distance and a mask, why would I even consider a vaccine?"
1855,"Looking at this, not getting the vaccine seems to have the best odds."
1856,"Yeah I heard that the Pfizer and Moderns tests were when infections were still ramping up, while AZ and J&amp;J tested later, when there were a lot more cases overall."
1857,There's a good chance that skewed some of the results.
1858,Not getting the vaccine still
1859,"I would not, because I understand that vaccines are not infallible."
1860,"I understand your first point but it distills down to “well I just simply won’t catch covid”, which hasn’t worked out well so far and becomes harder and harder the more people adopt that viewpoint as you’re moving from trying not to catch it in the space of a year to trying not to catch it for the rest of your life."
1861,"The news originally broke about ""6 young women"" but there've been 9 cases that are being looked at including 1 vaccinated young man, 1 placebo young woman, and a 59yo woman."

1864,I had my first 2 days ago.
1865,"I felt tired, had soreness in my upper arm to shoulder, and mild chills."
1866,These came on about 6-8 hours after the shot and were gone by 24 hours after I got the shot.
1867,I have a young child.
1868,"Luckily all the grandparents have gotten vaccinated, but had any refused I would have said if you want to see your grandchild you need to be vaccinated first."
1869,I'm probably overly cautious and overly protective.
1870,But the decision is ultimately up to you.
1871,Your son will probably be fine even if exposed.
1872,Key word is probably.
1873,I'm not willing to accept my child probably being ok from someone who is anti-vax/vaccine-hesitant.
1874,England doing hotel quarantine is well.
1875,It make3me so fucking angry that they locking healthy people under the guard and make them pay for it.

1878,"Now, it is only recommended to self isolate after the travel, and after 15 May it could be mandatory."
1879,"Not sure about that, reinfections are rare and seems to me that natural immunity is better than immunity from the vaccine."
1880,"He should have still been vaccinated though, all people who have not been infected should be vaccinated."
1881,"Yes yes and that's good and all, don't get me wrong, I am 100% pro vax, but wouldn't you feel better getting something that does not cause clots at all?"
1882,"I don't get that argument, just because getting the AZ vaccine is still a better choice than getting nothing, it is absoulutely reasonable for people to prefer other vaccines over it."
1883,It's good to know for people like you.
1884,It's good not to recommend it for people in a higher risk group.
1885,It's not necessary to stop use for everyone.
1886,I'm curious to know how your second shot goes?
1887,I had Covid in January and got my first Moderna shot a couple of weeks ago.
1888,"Had bad chills for a couple of days, worse than when I had Covid (but at least I didn't have any of the other Covid symptoms to deal with)."
1889,The rest of your life.
1890,How can you even claim this.
1891,COVID's been around for just over a year.
1892,No they should compare the risk of you catching COVID to the AZ vaccine.
1893,Then it starts to make more sense why people are hesitant
1894,"If they wanted to stress the difference between rural and urban, they really should've made two maps."
1895,One with all urban counties and one with all rural counties.
1896,This is very true.
1897,"Especially as the pandemic seems to be winding down in places like the US and the UK, the chances of actually catching covid are lower."
1898,"Germany is mostly vaccinating the second priority group right now (16 million people, group 1 was 7 million)."
1899,"This includes a lot of different jobs (teachers/police), people with certain health related risk factors, people older than 70 and in some cases contacts of these people (partners of pregnant women, carers of old people and so on)."
1900,Some states opened up AZ to everyone over 60 to make sure that there is enough demand to get rid of delieveries.
1901,"Group 3 (~12 million people) will start soon-ish, this includes people older than 65 and once again a whole lot of other people at risk."
1902,This is a valid point as long as you’d be willing to not interact with others until you could get a different kind of shot.
1903,"That shouldn’t include social distancing, wearing mask etc and still going out."
1904,If you have the opportunity to get vaccinated and choose not to I don’t believe you should have the right to increase risk to other people regardless of precautions.
1905,[removed]
1906,I had a similar question several weeks ago and I'll paste the best response I got.
1907,The main issue is Moderna elicited CD4+ T cells but NOT CD8+ T cells (whereas Pfizer elicited both).
1908,It looks like this doesn't matter but the jury is still out in the long run.
1909,"https://immunology.sciencemag.org/content/5/53/eabe8063

""Although the induction of antispike nAbs is the key component for an effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, it is well known that T cells, and particularly TFH cells, are critical to generate antibody-producing plasma cells and long-lived memory B cells."
1910,"In patients with COVID-19, high nAb titers correlated with strong CD4+ T cell responses, and the lack of functional TFH cells reacting against SARS-CoV-2 was shown to be detrimental... A final issue to consider is whether high quantities of vaccine-induced CD8+ T cells at local sites need to be elicited by future vaccine candidates."
1911,"If the initial group of vaccines in clinical trials that are primarily focused on generating an effective nAb response provides recipients with long-standing protection, then it may not be necessary to invest in such efforts."
1912,"However, if problems emerge in the vaccinated population with breakthrough infections, waning antibody levels after vaccination, and/or the emergence of new viral strains, then it would be wise to reconsider vaccine approaches specifically designed to induce functional CD8+ TRM responses in the upper respiratory tract."""
1913,"What if, hear me out, I don’t like the idea of either."
1914,I’m pro vax and got the moderna.

From the article:

1923,"""I doubt very seriously if we're talking about weeks to months,"" he told CNN on Wednesday."
1924,*
1925,How the turn tables!
1926,Overall chances of either are still super low.
1927,"Comparable to the risk of dying from some non-natural cause next week ([table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micromort#Baseline) for comparison), or riding a motor cycle to work."
1928,Or simply _living your life_ for a week.
1929,"Heck, I wouldn't be surprised if just being stressed about potential side effects of the vaccine is more deadly."
1930,There will always be _some_ risk.
1931,"Yes, you should avoid high risk situations, but you can't live your life avoiding _all_ risk."
1932,"This vaccine is very low risk, and the reward is getting your (and everyone else's) freedom back."
1933,"The only argument that I've heard that might hold water is as follows:

Equipment involved in things like MRNA manufacturing processes are very much supply constrained."
1934,If you opened patents then there would be a scramble to purchase the equipment and cause costs to rise to slow down distribution as different groups competed/stole equipment as needed.
1935,This would just increase costs and cause more difficulties.
1936,It is therefore more efficient to centralise on a single production line for a crisis like this.
1937,Not sure if this holds water (how supply constrained are precursor parts?).
1938,But it made sense if that were the case.
1939,This is an example of the trolly problem.
1940,By disallowing the use of J&amp;J we are allowing great numbers of people to be killed and sickened by inaction rather than cause the injury of less than 1 in a million by active measures.
1941,Awesome response and I completely agree with you.
1942,You actually laid out the groundwork of how this should be handled.
1943,If every adult can get a vaccine then why are we not talking about opening up?
1944,[removed]
1945,That's wild how different it is for everyone!
1946,Guess I'll have to see what happens after the second dose.
1947,A friend of mine is a week ahead of me for maybe I'll test vicariously through her as a preview...
1948,"I mean, I'm sure those dont help."
1949,"I randomly got tinnitus last fall, likely due to stuffy nose/allergies, and it's been with me ever since."
1950,"I don't notice it much anymore, but also the place where I currently live has a lot of white noise from a heater nearby, and I'm worried that when I go back home the silence will make it bother me more."
1951,Well the idea is you get up to at least 85% of the population and there aren't enough hosts for the virus to keep spreading and thus it dies out.
1952,"Even if you get infected and then recover you'd then still have some level of resistance or immunity for a time, so it doesn't necessarily have to be everyone vaccinated."
1953,"You can still have some people who could catch it, the idea is just that they won't come in contact with someone else who has it and thus once they recover and are no longer able to spread it that chain of infections dies off."
1954,Even just people using masks can help with that as even coming into contact won't guarantee the virus spreading to a new host.
1955,"I agree however that it's a seemingly unlikely outcome, particularly with the various mutations that are increasingly contagious making it harder to prevent their spread."
1956,The only upside in that respect is that generally speaking viruses grow increasingly resilient and contagious while often becoming less deadly at the same time.
1957,When viruses are too deadly they can disable and kill their hosts before they can spread which works against them eventually as they can't survive on their own without a host.
1958,Not to say this is necessary what has been happening or would eventually happen with Covid but it's possible.
1959,"I definitely agree with the sentiment that it's likely Covid just becomes a recurring ""seasonal"" virus akin to the flu that requires regular shots to keep up resistance to variants while never truly being killed off."
1960,In regards to younger children and such not getting the vaccine currently my understanding is that the main reason for this is that it's a combination of lower risk for serious conditions from actually catching covid combined with simply not having enough data on potential side effects of the vaccine in these age groups.
1961,The initial test groups did not include younger age groups and thus while it's largely believed that the vaccines would be safe for them we're waiting on further testing to ensure this.
1962,Meanwhile it makes sense to focus available doses on more at risk groups and those age groups that we have had trials on previously.
1963,Its stupid.
1964,All leaders need to be vaccinated.
1965,Idk guess?
1966,😒
1967,"This is a ""variant booster"" - to improve protection for current and possible future variants."
1968,For the past year and a half I've been wondering why this hasn't been done yet
1969,Not sure it matters what they say today since they can change their minds and say something else tomorrow.
1970,Next year they'll have to deal with whatever next year brings.
1971,Wait so what if you had covid in the past?
1972,Sadly this is nothing new.
1973,Fuck That satanic president
1974,"Yeah hormonal BC has a lot of side effects, which is why I don't use that shit either."
1975,"When you start by announcing you're not anti-vax, you sound anti-vax."
1976,And where'd you pull out this 1/10 infection rate from ?
1977,"Lol, what a load of BS 😂"
1978,"Absolutely exhausted since then but that happens when I get a flu shot too, so it wasn't unexpected."
1979,"Other than the fatigue, I feel totally fine."
1980,How are you?
1981,"&gt; In this case, the risk of catching COVID would have to be more than 1/8; from what I can tell the total infection rate in the USA is only about 1/10

You can easily see how your method fails in practice."
1982,"For example, the risk of measles is very very low."
1983,No one should be vaccinated because vaccines have more risk according to your simplistic method.
1984,"Epidemiology 101, you must know how contagious a disease is in order to assess risk."
1985,"Measles, is actually incredibly contagious with an R value 12-18."
1986,"Covid has an R value around 4, and it's only a matter of time before your 1/10 is 4/10 and then 10/10."
1987,The math gets even more complicated.
1988,Pfizer and Moderna are supplying approximately 23 million vaccine doses per month to the US vs 7 million J&amp;J.
1989,You only have to wait a week or two to get a safer and more effective vaccine.
1990,I think we are at the point now that our best action would be to see about the possibility of licensing production of Pfizer or Moderna vaccines to other pharmas - we clearly have a winner.
1991,"Um, yeah... but when you interact with someone who is anti-science, how does it make *you* anti-science somehow?"
1992,describe that mechanism for me....
1993,"When someone claims that chemtrails are turning the frogs gay, I don't respond to that by suddenly thinking the world is flat..."
1994,I would say a seven day daily average of *two deaths* should be more than enough to say that the restrictions aren't necessary.

1998,Yeah my fear and anxiety is experiencing anything remotely similar.

2003,The mental anxiety is certainly a hurdle and I spoke with my colleague this morning about it as he sent me a link to the local university here doing the vaccines.

2084,"I appreciate states that are ending mask mandates when most eligible residents are vaccinated, especially a state like New Hampshire where only one or two people are dying from this in a given day, but it's hard to say the mask mandate is really over when you can't go into a Target or Dunkin' without a mask."

b) if you get the J&amp;J vaccine, for example, then you have a 100% chance of getting that vaccine;  for less risk at getting clots from COVID you would only need a smaller than a 12.5% chance of getting COVID during the extra waiting time between when you can get the J&amp;J and a different vaccine."

2360,"We were supposed to have a slow period of J&amp;J deliveries around now anyways, I think, because of previous production issues."
2361,Seems like it all just sort of lined up timing wise.
2362,Hopefully once they give the go-ahead there will be some ready to go again.

2383,It took me a gallon of water to get through that first day.
2384,"But we're not refusing the investigate further, we've established all the meaningful information we need to make an informed decision."
2385,The viable alternative here is delaying your covid vaccination for a vaccine with a fairly inconsequential risk.
2386,"There are risks associated with that action too, by the way, to not only the vaccine taker but to other they might unwittingly spread the virus to, especially for peoples whos ability to successfully isolate is getting restricted, for the wellbeing of people who are stuck isolating longer as the vaccine rollout is delayed by people being particular over their vaccine."
2387,"We were ignoring these additional risk factor for the sake of keeping the conversation simple, if you want to start prodding at 'refusing to investigate further' you're only going to see your argument become less and less viable."
2388,Increasing my chances of dying this year from 0.8% to 0.8005% is not something i would consider a big deal.
2389,"But more than that, you're entire argument is flawed."
2390,IT relies on the idea that any path with risk is inherently stupid to take.

2405,"Definitely better to let someone who doesn't want to catch COVID get vaccinated instead, and you can wait until another carrot beyond that is added."
2406,If you do catch COVID in that time then you can have extra immunity after vaccination and you'll be doing your part to protect the community.
2407,"&gt; it’s literally life and death

Is it?"
2408,There are lots of people with hereditary clotting disorders - like 3 to 8 percent of Europeans have Faktor V Leiden Mutation.
2409,So far no increased risk from taking AZ has been found for these people.
2410,I doubt it unless the flu shot is also a mRNA vaccine.
2411,mRNA-lipidnanoparticle stability is low and I wouldn't be surprised if adding additional components reduces that stability.

2422,"What you are describing is not 100% effectiveness, it is a phenomenon known as herd immunity."
2423,Israel has reached a point where there is such a high level of immunity within the population that 1 case of Covid will on average spread to less than 1 new person.
2424,Here in the US 1 case of Covid will on average spread to more than 1 new person.
2425,This rate of spread is known as the basic reproduction number also called R0.
2426,"So Israel has an R0 which is less than 1, and the US has an R0 more than 1."
2427,"If we bring our R0 below 1 through high rates of vaccination, we can get back to normal life."
2428,"That is correct, we're piggybacking the EUs big contracts."
2429,We wouldn't be able to negotiate a better deal on our own anyway.
2430,Okay!
2431,So there hopefully wouldn’t be complications if someone was vaccinated with the J&amp;J vaccine and then got an mRNA booster shot?

2438,Sorry red shirts.
2439,I wonder if even small inducements could encourage it.
2440,"I think they allocated something north of $200 million for public-facing campaigns to target the vaccine hesitant after the demand dies down, but..."
2441,"I wonder if it would be better to use that $200 million to print up 40,000,000 $5 gift cards, or get the pharmacies &amp; retailers to gift-card-match and make them $10 for getting your vaccination."
2442,Dunno why.
2443,Government officials are very much vital to the operation of their country.
2444,They are the ones that a country can't really afford to get sick.
2445,Also it sets a powerful image of safety in vaccines if a leader gets it before others.
2446,"&gt;Yep, at 90% effectiveness, you have a 1 in 10 shot of still being susceptible to the infection

Sounds great to me."
2447,"I would say that's great at protecting me, not poor."
2448,"I looked it up, and R0 seems to describe infection rates."
2449,But my question pertains to the individual who has an amount of virus in their body that is lower than the viral load.
2450,What happens to *that* individual and the actual physical material of the virus inside *them*?
2451,Probably call CVS and ask again if it doesn't go down soon then.
2452,New Hampshire has no boarder controls.
2453,"Israel, has all of them."
2454,People who were infected previously with covid had strong reactions to the first dose and none to the second dose.
2455,I'm assuming people who had a strong reaction to the second dose wont have a bad reaction to a third dose.
2456,Lol wow what a piece of work you are 😂
2457,"&gt;90% efficacy means that if half the country is vaccinated and there are 100,000 daily cases, then 10,000 of them would be vaccinated people."
2458,"So, yes you are still at risk if the virus is widely circulating."
2459,But it is not correct to say it is poor at protecting me if I have it.

2514,"Michigan's 7-day rolling average is still rising, though may be near flat."
2515,I haven't calculated the crude death rate for a while but this is one of the few agencies reporting deaths by age and incidence by age so the mortality rate and can be calculated.
2516,"https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Daten/Klinische_Aspekte.html

However it may hinge on our definition of young."
2517,I am counting it as people between 18 and 49.
2518,Also it presumes we know the incident rate which requires a lot of testing.
2519,Germany appears to be doing sufficient testing but it is probably slightly skewed
2520,"What really fucking annoys me in many of the answers here is *only* comparing blood clot (or rather CVT / ""brain clots"") risk between Covid and AZ/vaccines."
2521,Instead of mortality / side effects / long term effects (off both) in general.
2522,"Yes, AZ might have a higher risk of CVTs than Pfizer/Biontech, and yes, it might ""only be n times less than the risk of those from Covid"" – but Covid can cause death / hospitalization / long term lung or neural damage / ""Long Covid"" / watever IN ADDITION to blood clots / CVTs."
2523,"And yep, even in ""the young and healthy"" (although with lower probability than in the elderly / other groups at risk – but still quite a bit)."
2524,Sounds really fucking short-sighted thinking to me.
2525,"Yeah, it might be best if everyone would get ""the good vaccine"", but not everyone can (ask Europe or even better, ask ""poorer countries) and in really the very most cases even ""the bad one"" sooner is still much better than getting Covid and dying from blood clots or any of the other many ways it can kill you – or suffering from any of the long term effects."
2526,"On top of that: Getting yourself vaccinated sooner does not only protect your individual sorry corpse, it also protects others by reducing potential for further spread (and mutations) and of course protecting those who cannot get vaccinated or whose immune system cannot build as effective an immune response with the vaccine (""vaccine non responders"" is the term, iirc.)."
2527,"What I'm saying is: no, it's not just ""AZ clots vs Covid clots vs Biontech clots""."

2539,And so many people who live here and work in Massachusetts?

2758,I’m interested to hear how fully vaccinated people do with prolonged exposure to someone infectious.
2759,[removed]
2760,Same thing with this vaccine.
2761,The vaccine is free but they still bill your insurance for the administration.
2762,"To be absolutely clear, they will not bill you for any cost associated with the vaccine even if you do not have insurance."
2763,Just saying how they are still going to play their typical bullshit games.
2764,The restriction isnt capacity that's all.
2765,Capacity doesnt mean amount of customers we can serve at any given time.
2766,It literally means what is the legal limit of the maximum number of people the fire  department says can be in the room before it poses too large of a fire danger.

2778,He is a 50 year old free rider re: herd immunity (definition below).
2779,I don't know how to convince what I see as selfish people.
2780,Vaccination may be discouraged by the incentive to “free-ride”.
2781,"Referred to herein as “free-riders” in vaccination, these individuals avoid the cost associated with vaccination while benefiting from other individuals' vaccination."
2782,PS  SO GLAD YOUR DAD CAME AROUND!!
2783,!
2784,"In the trials the symptom onset curves diverged almost entirely on day 11, implying protection from infection a few days earlier."
2785,Yea no prob!
2786,That’s a big issue.
2787,Wish I had an answer
2788,I think I got the basics right.
2789,I should have rephrased the part about the spike and protein conformations.
2790,AstraZeneca is a chimpanzee adenovirus which has its own surface proteins + the genetic sequence for the sars2 spike protein.
2791,An immune response is triggered for all of those antigens.
2792,"ALso as far as I know Astrazeneca doesn't use the proline method like BioNtech which makes the spike have a more stable conformation that cause the spike to adopt a prefusion-stabilized conformation reducing the membrane fusion ability, increasing expression and stimulating neutralizing antibodies."
2793,This results in a more targeted immune response and less side effects.
2794,I'm proably not spitting facts here but I assume this is the reason for the increased efficacy of mRNA vaccines as oppsed to viral vectors.
2795,Never really saw anyone doing that
2796,"(Checks to make sure I’m not on /r/covid19, where anecdotal discussion is bannable)

About two months ago, both my aunt and uncle got sick after being fully vaccinated with one of the mRNA vaccines, and spread it to several of my unvaccinated family members in turn."
2797,"Aunt and uncle are in their 80s with major health issues, and since central NC is not currently experiencing a vaccine-breaking surge of a new variant, I’m guessing it was just that their immune systems aren’t working at full capacity."
2798,"Luckily it was a mild course for both of them, and all the other family members also recovered, although one of them had to go to the hospital a couple of times."
2799,"Without the vaccine, I’m pretty sure it would have been a death sentence for my aunt and uncle given their health issues and age."
2800,Per other vaccines research you should probably wait 12 weeks.
2801,We will probably have data on boosters eventually.
2802,"There was another anti-worm drug that a lot of people were screaming from the rooftops about, but they were relegated to the lunatic fringe."
2803,I almost turned down an extra one at Walgreens because the pharmacist asked for an insurance card.
2804,When I said never-mind I don’t have insurance was the first time I had heard it was free.
2805,"Its not an either or with masks, shutdowns and kids."
2806,You are correct that stats do state children are less susceptible to covid than adults.
2807,one needs to realize when looking at stats of children vs.
2808,"Adults that we don't compare generally what percent of a 100k population are children vs. adults and we only compare children to children, and adults to adults."
2809,Otherwise the groups become skewed by comparison as children only counts humans 0-18 and Adults counts every human above 18 yo.
2810,"That said, yes children are less susceptible."
2811,"However we do need to begin to expect and plan for the effects of the vaccine on adults, lessening restrictions in general and their effects on spread, the expected rise in cases among children, etc."
2812,We need to try to assess the difference masks and social distancing have had thus far on the spread of covid among children and what it will be without them.
2813,"Data suggests it will of course be higher but possibly counter acted by vaccinated adults, but to what extent."
2814,I hope it will be low as vaccines continue and rollouts expand.
2815,Data should drive all approaches to covid so watch the children case count and react accordingly.
2816,What's that supposed to mean?
2817,The problem is for YOUNG women.
2818,[deleted]
2819,“.... study finds” — that’s a rather important part of the headline to leave out!
2820,"I mean, yes and no."
2821,"The vaccine is free, but someone still has to be paid to administer it."
2822,"I understand it, but the whole vaccination process is not free and they WILL bill your insurance."
2823,"Every doctor knows how to treat blood clottings, it's easy."
2824,"This is why they said on the news ""don't take prophylaxis, it's not worth it"", for some reason, because this was most doctor's first idea."
2825,I believe it was actually briefly (?)
2826,required in another department where I work.
2827,"(Either that, or literally 20+ people started double masking one day and haven’t stopped...)"
2828,Nothing is free!
2829,I think strains that are both more contagious and more virulent (especially for younger people) will make a round or two though the unvaccinated population and magically people will want the shots.
2830,P1 is on it's way.
2831,Have you seen them gather around Starbucks sharing each other’s drinks?
2832,"Maskless, except for the one who had Covid (overheard as they stand in the middle of the sidewalk.)"
2833,No shit!
2834,It's remarkable that they were able to figure this out in just a little over a year.
2835,True geniuses at work.
2836,It's standard but they say it doesn't really matter.
2837,"Seems like it would be more sure to get a system-wide response,  but I guess that's pretty sure anyway."
2838,congrats!
2839,:)
2840,I was just looking up a link as I knew Astra Zeneca provided the vaccine on a nonprofit basis (pretty sure the Oxford university scientists requested this).
2841,"It may not be nonprofit for ever (or even for long) though:

https://www.ft.com/content/c474f9e1-8807-4e57-9c79-6f4af145b686"
2842,"This is what I think would’ve happened if we had a slow vaccine rollout like Canada:

People would’ve probably assumed that the virus was on the same path as last year, since the Northeast is having a surge now and March/April is when the tri-state and Michigan got the brunt of their first wave last year."
2843,"Fauci would probably predict a summer surge for southern states and CA, and the public health guidance for all holidays this year would remain, “whatever your plans are, cancel them”."

2845,Looks like NY's cases are starting to drop off
2846,"Remember when y'all were screaming ""conspiracy theorist"" when we warned you of exactly this"

2858,I just recently found out it's free.
2859,I don't have insurance so was waiting until I could afford it.
2860,Thankfully that's not an issue.
2861,"I'm online often and I hadn't previously seen it was free for everyone, kinda surprised I never seen that information while searching Covid stuff online."
2862,"Bad analogy, we are not stopping vaccinating."
2863,We just stopped using the one type we receive the fewest of.
2864,In our vaccination plan this just means that the last group (Healty 30-34 year olds) will be done 3 weeks later than planned.
2865,17% have gotten their first shot and 8% is fully vaccinated already.
2866,"To be fair, Americas response (or lack of), case numbers, death toll, etc have been, like, well out of the ordinary."
2867,We don't do anything in a small way in America.
2868,"Once again, a messaging issue."
2869,I make sure I tell everyone I know that it is free.
2870,"Median time to symptoms is 5 days and pcr test starts working a bit before symptoms, so maybe 60-70%?"
2871,"Rough estimate but still, it's early enough to be pretty useless."
2872,Do not stop isolating based on that.
2873,&gt;that the positive of keeping the economy going outweighs all the lives that will be lost.
2874,It obviously doesn't.
2875,"The economy is ""open"" because otherwise capitalists would lose their grasp over the population."
2876,"Yeah, and airlines will do that when hell freezes over."
2877,But this is the biggest BS of healthcare... the billing is horrendous.
2878,"So many errors, so many screw ups, so much time and stress."
2879,"If you don’t deal with fighting their errors and procrastinate paying, you end up being hounded by some ahole collection agent that doesn’t care if the bill was legit or not."

2888,I know someone who was shot in the back over a matter of $80
2889,"&gt; The messaging coming from Fauci is, “fully vaccinated?"
2890,Continue to stay home and do nothing!
2891,It’s still not safe to go to a restaurant.
2892,"No, it's just ""avoid crowds and wear masks until cases drop significantly and we find out if people who are vaccinated can still spread the virus""  

This isn't complicated."
2893,"The goal is to reduce the spread of the virus because the more it spreads the more we risk a variant emerging that either spreads faster, does more harm/kills more people, or evades the immune system of even vaccinated people."
2894,The CDC says that vaccinated people can travel and see friends/family (if also vaccinated) in their homes without masks or distancing.
2895,"Indoor dining right now is still stupid, but as long as idiots don't fuck this up by doing it anyway cases should drop pretty quickly now that more and more people are being vaccinated."
2896,"Once that happens I'm looking forward to going back into restaurants (I've got a growing list which ones I want to return to) but I've already waited more than a year, a few more weeks/months isn't a huge deal."
2897,Yes I got my first dose recently and my arm was really sore for awhile.
2898,"Feeling better now though, and just so glad to have gotten it!"
2899,"Exactly the same numbers as here in Finland, I see."

2922,"Luckily he oversees the time off for our department, and he is looking the other way if people don’t put in time off to get it."
2923,Probably.
2924,"And yet somehow I received a payment *from* my insurance after getting tested (and no, I did not pay anything out of pocket for the test)."
2925,"The whole billing practice seems super shady, and perhaps this testing and vaccination experience can be used to push us towards a better system."
2926,Would Alberta be more like Canda's Texas or Canada's Florida?
2927,"&gt;until like February

What month is it?"
2928,Still American logic though
2929,It's does here in Denmark.
2930,"If the spread of C19 is low, the chance of getting it before you have got your vaccine is minor."
2931,But if you get the AZ vaccine you are 100% curtain to roll the dice to see if you are the 1 in 40.000 that gets a blood cloth from it.
2932,You mean Because they know it’s untested poison killing people and CV19 (the flu) is only .03% fatal !
2933,No mRNA Vaxx Ever !!!!
2934,Don’t do it.
2935,"Take Vit C &amp; D, Zinc &amp; Magnesium."
2936,And yes that’s free information too 😉
2937,&gt;The important thing now is that they know how to diagnose it and they know how to treat it.
2938,"People under the age of 30, at low risk from Covid itself, can choose to have an alternative vaccine."
2939,"But nobody should say do not get vaccinated, said Scully."
2940,"&gt;“That is one message we cannot put across because it’s absolutely critical for public health,” she said."
2941,So the government can’t shut down the establishment since they don’t have a permit to operate anyhow...
2942,Shut them off for tax evasion then.
2943,Find a legal loophole.
2944,Canada has wack jobs too.
2945,They seem to be concentrated in that vast nothingness between Alberta and Inland BC
2946,&gt; But some folks just didn’t want to hear it.
2947,Lots of them are in here.
2948,[deleted]
2949,This made me snort laugh.
2950,*So* true.
2951,"&gt;  fatigue, shortness of breath, gastrointestinal problems, muscle and joint pain, and neurological issues."
2952,These symptoms are not unique to Covid.
2953,They are not all even typical of Covid.
2954,The people tested negative.
2955,Is it not possible that they suffer from some one of the other thousands of diseases that still exist?
2956,"not trying to argue either, just trying to explain why your initial comment might rub some people the wrong way."
2957,"I'm in the US too, so I totally get what you're saying about how getting two vaccines pulled would have totally tanked a lot of people's trust, and it was probably for the best AZ hadn't been rolled out in the US."
2958,"but yeah, saying that you don't understand why this study is being published is relevant because it isn't relevant to you (since you have access to better vaccines) is going to rub some the wrong way."
2959,"It's like if someone made a video showing a drop test between a more expensive phone and a cheaper phone and the cheaper one survives the drop better and someone comes along saying ""but if you get the $400 case that goes with the more expensive phone it survives drops better than the cheap phone with the cheap case, I dont see why dropping these phones without a case is relevant, the expensive one performs much better anyway"", that's also obviously gonna rub people the wrong way."
2960,"Woohoo, saw this headline and made an appointment right away!"
2961,"I understand that there are crazies everywhere, but going into this post, I would have put the odds that this was in Canada and not the U.S. very, very low"
2962,That's a very ignorant statement.
2963,The Indian census has been conducted since at least 1881 and is generally regarded as a reliable source of demographic data for the country.
2964,we get the same tv and the same internet you do - it was bound to be contagious.
2965,"for those not in BC, Kelowna is sort of covid-denier central in this province, although they are everywhere these days..."
2966,I have the same thing and I’m a bit concerned.
2967,How did you deal with the situation?
2968,"I remember in like May of last year when my area was at a low point, one of my friends told me their office had pushed back the reopening date to January 1 of 2021."
2969,"I remember thinking wow, that's pretty ridiculous, guess they decided to play it REALLY safe at that company."
2970,"Still not back in my office, 4/14/2021."
2971,Neither are they.
2972,"It's odd hat in the UK we have seen very similar post vaccination deaths for both AZ and Pfizer, yet it's only AZ that pops up on reddit."
2973,Almost as many people here have died from diarrhoea following the pfizer jab brain clots from AZ...
2974,And which doctor uses unfractionated heparin as a prophylaxis?
2975,"Same here, also sis in law in her 40s."
2976,Full vaccin Pfizer.
2977,Nephew brought home covid.
2978,"Still got symptomatic covid, but not that bad."
2979,What people seem to forgot is that a covid infection will still fuck your life up for a good 2 weeks  vaccinated or not.
2980,"That is.. with all the quarantaine,  testing, waiting for whole family to get better, fixing your groceries, not working etc etc."
2981,"I really wonder why the price of that ""non-profit"" vaccine is different for different buyers (last I heard, the UK is paying three or four times as much per dose as the EU)."
2982,[deleted]
2983,There is a weird double standard here imo.
2984,"There were perfectly fine healthy and young adults in Germany that took it because they wanted o contribute to the community and in exchange they died, This can't really be the risk management here."
2985,THese people would have been perfeclty fine with the standard covid safety guidelines.
2986,I'm glad really and really envious for how  AZ worked out in the UK but man knowing what we know now I ca understand why people wouldn't take the risk.
2987,That's why I'm glad that the core gorup of people that had these blood clots won't be treated with AZ anymore.
2988,And of those people how serious were the symptoms?
2989,I think that study showed 90% infection protection with 95% disease prevention.
2990,"&gt; Letting the virus circulate and mutate

Getting vaccinated won't stop you from getting the virus."
2991,It'll keep you from showing symptoms.

2997,We do the same thing with farming in the UK.
2998,"Farmers are subsidised pretty heavily for certain goods, but it's a security thing also, like you mention."
2999,They were sure if they provided sterilizing immunity.
3000,It definitely prevents or limits the disease.
3001,"Data is also showing that the mRNA vaccines do indeed prevent 90% of infection as well, which is what the CDC announced 3-29."
3002,"On Monday, we re-opened all non-essential shops, gyms, hairdressers, and outdoor restaurants and pubs."
3003,"indoor dining and pubs will come on May 17th and all restrictions end on June 21st, by which time we hope to have given the first dose to 70% of the population and would have achieved herd immunity."
3004,"(We've given the first dose to 48.2% and second dose to 12.2%, so we're getting there)."
3005,"&gt; People just simply no longer care and have developed a ""if I die, I die"" mentality with an absolute, complete, and total disregard for other peoples safety."
3006,We've been moving toward that ever since the beginning.
3007,I can't judge these people anymore.
3008,"If you were flaunting the guidelines in March and April of last year because you couldn't be bothered to inconvenience yourself for a few weeks to contribute to a worldwide effort to save lives, then you were an asshole."
3009,"But slowly over time, that's less and less the case."
3010,We're now past 13 months of living like this.
3011,It's not natural.
3012,Everyone has a breaking point.
3013,If you want your normal life back after a year of this crap...
3014,I can't judge you.
3015,I just hope you get the vaccine first.
3016,And it only took them close to 18 years and another pandemic to figure that out even though reports of MERS and SARS 1 spreading through the hospital ventilation system have been around since 2003.
3017,Amazing.
3018,"Don’t forget, Florida obviously is lying about their numbers."
3019,/s
3020,"Lol, I don't know if my entire state has hit zero deaths multiple days this month"
3021,"Yes, this is right."
3022,"It is needed, investigating is indeed good science."
3023,"Still there is no investigation, or better said consequences, for the pill."
3024,"The pill isn't even needed, so why argue that cases appearing as a side effect of the pill aren't as serious as those of the -urgently needed- vaccine?"
3025,Yeah everyone let’s get the vaccine and get back to work!
3026,"It is not mine, and it is not, as far as I can tell, wrong."
3027,And it’s worked.
3028,Also Florida isn’t in not-United States.
3029,The vaccine is widely available.
3030,literally.
3031,I dont think anyone ever flipped their shit over children getting the flu at school- its literally more dangerous to them than covid is...
3032,/r/Redditmoment
3033,"The only person in my D&amp;D group to not be vaccinated yet scheduled an appointment for next week, so we should be able to start playing in person again in June."
3034,"I am so excited, it’s just not the same playing over Roll20."
3035,What is the 7 day average?
3036,"If it's close to that, how the hell are you still in lockdown?"
3037,That's less than the 200 a day I think should free us in America when adjusted per capita.
3038,"This scares me a little, hearing 23 deaths and still in lockdown, but it isn't America so..."
3039,Trust the science
3040,millions of people are getting the AZ vaccine shot in India and no one's talking about blood clots.
3041,Me too!
3042,I cannot stop thinking this is for sure going to happen to me.
3043,So scared
3044,From what I've read yes.
3045,Large events may require proof of vaccination and/or testing depending on indoor or outdoor and size.
3046,And what they're calling common sense practices (i.e.
3047,"masks in most situations, still having sanitation stations and extra cleaning measures, etc)"
3048,Same here.
3049,"Got mine on the 6th, just sitting here at 230am wondering if this pain in my neck is a blood clot that’s about to kill me right when my covid anxiety was finally relieved."

3057,"That sounds great in theory, but that is not how things are playing out."
3058,"Half of the hospitalizations, for example, in Brazil are under the age of 40."
3059,"Now that's not the US, but the US does have quite a few spots right now where hospitalizations are increasing and that while I agree that vaccination efforts can really help us end this entirely from the perspective of having to manage capacity, the notion that young people who aren't vaccinated will not get hospitalized to an extent to cause some stress on the system is exactly what we are testing right now in places like MI, FL and other states where hospitalizations are on the rise again."
3060,"No, it'll almost certainly stop you from ""getting it""."
3061,"If it doesn't, it'll almost certainly stop you from getting a meaningful case."
3062,"Shortage of beds, medicines, icu wards, oxygen and vaccines and yet our PM is organising rallies and large gatherings."
3063,And the UK has only received 1/3rd of its expected deliveries from AZ.
3064,The response?
3065,Not triggering international arguments and undermining public faith in vaccinations.
3066,I heard that since first outbreak in wuhan
3067,2 big differences.
3068,you take the pill REGULARLY.
3069,you only take 2 vaccine shots.
3070,if adverse effects happen in those 2 thats definitely something that needs investigating.
3071,there is also no public pressure or requirement to take the pill.
3072,you do that by choice.
3073,they already begun to tie lessening restrictions to tests or the vaccine.
3074,once you are vaccinated you are allowed more things than when unvaccinated or untested.
3075,this does not nor has it ever happened with the pill.
3076,you should also inform yourself about what Denmarks reasons are.
3077,their COVID situation is fine enough that they decided its not worth the risk to keep giving out AZ.
3078,thats all there is too it.
3079,"they don't even claim that the EMAs judgement about the vaccine is wrong, they only say that they currently DO NOT REQUIRE IT AND THEREFORE STOP USING IT."
3080,risk vs reward.
3081,its that simple.
3082,"Something: Free of charge 

Americans: What's the catch?"
3083,Not surprised.
3084,You have to pay for everything in this country.
3085,How would they know?
3086,I don't think vaccination history is a requirement for any gym I've been to
3087,"i haven’t read the details of california’s june 15th, does that mean all restrictions lifted besides masks?"
3088,"100% capacity indoor dining, full sports stadiums, bars and night clubs open with full capacity and ability to move?"
3089,1  in 40.000
3090,[removed]
3091,"I mean, CA is pretty much opening up June 15th and it was one of the first states to go into lockdown ..."
3092,Why would anyone think it costs anything?
3093,"Not everyone who has been vaccinated has been exposed to Covid in a way that would cause an unvaccinated person to catch it, so just dividing the number of cases by the number of vaccinated people isn’t going to give you accurate efficacy numbers."
3094,&gt; Vaccine profits go straight to the corporation.
3095,"The Oxford vaccine is non-profit, it was mandated before joining with AZ for distribution."
3096,Quite a difference from he 50 billion plus Pfizer stand to make.
3097,If that is all the CDC knew than they knew less than many people on this sub reddit.
3098,That is sad.
3099,I really hope you are wrong about our public health officials.
3100,"*shocked pikachu face* after everything what this government is ""doing"""

3109,"I'm British Columbia, essential workers are also getting shots; so cashiers and the like are getting pricked"
3110,"The best medical guess right now (all this is still being studied) is that the vaccine provides much better, and much longer immunity than simply having had covid."
3111,"The immunity from having had the disease may last as little as a few months, whereas the first vaccines are already showing immunity that lasts 6 months or more."
3112,"So yes, you should get the vaccine as well - it’ll “re-up” your immunity for another 6+ months."
3113,read what the above poster has written.
3114,childrens immune system works differently than adults.
3115,its the main reason why the vaccines are NOT given to children so far.
3116,they currently do testing.
3117,"which I do not approve as children are safer from COVID then they are from the flu, but thats another topic."
3118,the long COVID or asthma fear is unreasonable.
3119,California is about 12% of the US population and cases are not going up its currently flat...
3120,And he probably didn’t believe you/assumed you were mistaken.
3121,"not saying it will magically disappear, but saying we i think we can go back to complete normal, maybe still wearing masks, even with covid cases around if 75% are fully vaxxed.risk of health system overrun is basically 0 at that point"
3122,How?
3123,It's kind of interesting how the discourse has tended to move around over the past 18 months or so.
3124,"Pre-pandemic, anybody who expressed concerns about any vaccine safety at all -- for example suggested changes in vaccination schedules as an explanation for changes in the population prevalence of certain illnesses -- was branded as a conspiracy theorist and an 'anti-vaxxer' (people like Robert Kennedy Jr.)."
3125,"Now that people have become more engaged with the issue, the discourse has changed without anybody really acknowledging it, from 'vaccines are completely safe and anybody who disagrees is an antivaxxer' to '*of course* vaccines entail risks -- all medicines do', and the prior animus against people who expressed concerns about even population-level vaccine ill-effects have been transferred to people who are improperly perceiving degrees of *individual* risk."
3126,"I have no axe to grind about any of that, it's just an interesting change."
3127,I just found this out last week from my friend who got it.

3130,"I went scavenging through reddit this evening and am horrified by how many people are out there who would read an article like this and think ""See?!"
3131,"The vaccine doesn't work at all!"""
3132,We're seeing an infection rate of like 0.008% at MOST in the fully vaccinated population .
3133,"As the vaccine is brought to more people, that number is only going to keep getting lower."
3134,"I guess that’s not entirely known, but I listened to a Yale professor say “essentially, yes” to your question."
3135,The virus wont magically disappear the day you hit 75%.
3136,"But it will starr to go down, until it reaches a very low level."
3137,"So, after vaccinations it will take a little time for cases to drop."
3138,"Its dropping already, but it will still take some time"
3139,"While a lot of it goes overboard, I do think that some of the extensive criticism of the media here lately is understandable."
3140,A few weeks ago there was a lot of insistence from some media outlets like CNN that a big fourth wave was coming to that US or specifically to the states that opened up quickly which was never very science-based and didn’t pan out at all.
3141,And before that there were all the articles about how variants would make things much worse for the US in February and March only for cases and deaths to instead drop dramatically.
3142,"So basically things often aren’t as bad (in the US, but many redditors here like myself are Americans) as the media often predicted them to be largely because of the vaccines."
3143,"However, when there is also wall-to-wall coverage of an extremely rare vaccine side effect and some articles don’t put that risk into perspective well there is reason to be concerned that the serious problem of vaccine hesitancy is going to get worse."
3144,We should also keep in mind that people are extremely tired of this pandemic and may be becoming less open to new perspectives now that they have had time for theirs to settle into their brains.
3145,So valid opinions tend to come off as overly hostile instead of being a source of good discussion.

3153,"In many countries they stopped the AstraZeneca vaccine for people below a certain age, mostly 60 years."
3154,"Since most countries start with the elderly population and work themselves down, this doesn’t have a big impact at the moment because young people won’t get vaccinated until June or July at the earliest."
3155,If you didn’t end up giving them your info then they treated you like an uninsured person and billed the government.
3156,"Doesn’t really matter, although I think we’d all like to see the cost of this come out of big insurance companies pockets rather than our tax dollars."
3157,"Yes, older people are mostly vaccinated in Brazil"
3158,yeah we’d use it and i’d take either as well.but think about how much higher the numbers of people who would be unwilling or very reluctant to take the vaccines if those were the only options available.some countries in europe over half the people don’t even want the AZ shot now because of how much a fiasco that’s been
3159,[removed]
3160,And it gets worse.
3161,Vaccine and raw materials manufacturing  is subcontracted.
3162,Corporations also profit from advance payments.
3163,Corporations then proceed to profit from each vial delivered.
3164,They are not held liable for any damages or for missing delivery targets.
3165,"Profits in 2020 - J&amp;J $13B, Pfizer $9B, Sanofi $3B, AstraZeneca $5B - and like that every single year."

3167,I have seen TONS more people out walking and exercising at my normal spots during covid.
3168,Lots of bigger people too.

3180,Cool!
3181,But 1.1 minutes is not OK. Got it.
3182,If you get the first shot tomorrow won’t you get the next one 21 or 28 days later?
3183,Why?
3184,"AZ is safe for elderly people, and J&amp;J is statistically very very safe."
3185,One fatality per million doesnt compare to the Covid-19 fatality rate.
3186,"If AZ and J&amp;J is what we had, it's absolutely what everyone would use."
3187,I'd have no issue taking either vaccin.
3188,Seems like this is something we should be able to expedite.
3189,There is some vaccine hesitancy around the emergency use status.
3190,Yeah you're right.
3191,Places like brazil have it easy.
3192,And those same people (the ones who wouldn’t wear masks and wondered why shutdowns were happening) are now refusing to do THE ONE THING THAT WOULD END THIS SHIT - get vaccinated.
3193,Are they “living in fear” of a little ol’ vaccine?
3194,I'm just amazed that we didn't see much harm reduction strategies in the US.
3195,Some states were strict locked down for months at a time.
3196,Did government really think that people were not going to socialize?
3197,"Instead of doing it in a place with rules like social distancing, masks requirements, table limit sizes."
3198,"Governments said ""Just stay home"" and closed everything, so people just went to each others houses instead with no masks or anything."
3199,"""Just stay home"" was like telling someone to ""stop using heroin if you don't wanna get HIV or overdose""."
3200,"When we run needle exchanges and give our narcan, we're not telling people ""go out and use heroin, it's great!"""
3201,"we're saying ""Heroin is bad for you, but if you're going to make a decision that's bad for your health, try to make it as safe as possible with clean needles and narcan""

But so many US states got puritanical and said ""Just stay home"" with their rules and messaging."

3217,Your analogy doesn't work because the reason my car only goes 40 is because of a restriction placed by the same people that made the speed limit 80.
3218,"So allowing me to go 80, when you limit my car to going 40 is a BS way of having the speed limit you want."
3219,Do you not see how manipulative and BS that is?
3220,It's like gaslighting or something.
3221,It's like some silly BS that parents make up to kids.
3222,"Like telling your kid if they clean their room, they can have ice cream."
3223,Then locking the door and not allowing them to go in their room.
3224,"You can BS say the restriction on ice cream is due to the uncleaned room, not the locked door, but that would be BS."
3225,We are not children.
3226,That logic shouldn't work on anyone.
3227,Sorry.
3228,"But there is no 100% capacity because of social distancing, and claiming otherwise is lying."

3234,*
3235,In May/June all they knew was that the lockdowns had slowed the spread.
3236,"Then in the summer they said that if cases aren't brought down the fall will be awful, and it was."
3237,What's the total death toll so far?
3238,More than all 20th century wars combined?
3239,And you're saying they overreacted?
3240,What is going to be unfortunate for them is if this turns in to a super spreader event for the whole world with a new strain linked forever to Japan.
3241,That is going to be stain that will be hard to remove from your country’s history.
3242,What could possibly go wrong.
3243,They are.
3244,And my phone sometimes deletes them.
3245,It DID say that the chances are astronomically low.
3246,"There have been stories in the news, periodically, about a for-profit clinic offering vaccine, and then charging hundreds of $'s for the ""service"" of injecting the free vaccine."
3247,"Those stories get reported on local news, of course."
3248,Some people never get past that point.
3249,Has anyone read or heard about any proposed theory(s) of what might be causing the clots directly related to the vaccine itself?
3250,I haven't.
3251,"I understand the CDC and FDA will continue to investigate, just wondering if there were any ideas being floated as to the cause of said clotting...."
3252,Until more people start demanding this if there elected officials they will drag there feet until the vary last moment.

3254,Again an IUD is the least likely to cause side effects.
3255,Also it takes time for birth control to work its way out of your system where as an IUD can be removed and you are back to normal within 24 hours.
3256,You are also making the pain of IUD insertion to be a bigger deal than it is.
3257,That is the sexist line of reasoning doctors used to deny young women without children IUDs for literally decades.
3258,Was it painful?
3259,Hell yes.
3260,Did I want to die for like an hour afterward?
3261,You bet.
3262,Do I trust a 16 year old to decide for herself if she can handle it?
3263,Absolutely.
3264,I'm not advocating for lying to anyone or forcing anyone into anythjng.
3265,However if my 16 year old daughter was going to have sex as her mother I would tell her than an IUD is her best option.
3266,It is the most effective option (so least likely to result in an abortion despite your BS anecdote) and the least likely to cause side effects.
3267,It is also the least likely to cause breast cancer because it doesn't habe estrogen (particularly important for my theoretical daughter because literally every woman in my family over 50 has had estrogen based breast cancer).
3268,Unless someone has a really low pain tolerance or happens to be one of the unlucky ones that has really bad side effects from the IUD (which they won't know until they try it) it's going to be their best option.

3270,Are you?
3271,What data are you referencing here?
3272,Let's find out.
3273,Hope you find a new lobby for the next round of lockdown :)
3274,Wat
3275,[removed]
3276,Texans aren’t as dumb as people on Reddit like to stereotype them
3277,Ive also read a comment where persons coworkers didnt want to get it in fears of losing the privilige of working from home
3278,"Not an anti-vaxxer, but I’ve been skeptical of these vaccines since the day they were announced."
3279,It quells my worries that they’re taking the risks found so seriously.
3280,"No, they laid out the *metrics* for reopening and the metrics haven't been met."
3281,All I can say is my whole life I have often felt sick after a flight.
3282,"I don’t doubt that the air circulates well, but I won’t fly until this pandemic is over."
3283,But I also hate flying and am not so eager to get back on a plane anyway.
3284,.
3285,.
3286,"I know n=6 is very small but when no men or women over 50 have had this, I'd think pausing only for women under 50 would be more reasonable"
3287,They bill if available but will not cost you or affect deductibles or anything else on your insurance.
3288,Dont have it they bill the government I think?
3289,Heard immunity is local.
3290,So areas with low vax rates will have outbreaks until enough of them acquire natural immunity or die from it.
3291,"If your city hits 70 percent, you won’t have community spread."
3292,Though you might get some cases from travelers.
3293,Should be business as usual in those places.
3294,Their loss.
3295,"Apologies I meant B1.351 which is the SA variant, I encourage you to look at page 12."
3296,The variant is clearly increasing as a proportion of overall infections.
3297,&gt; And B.1.1.7.
3298,"still continues to drastically outcompete B1.135, as is said in one of the first lines of that report."
3299,"For now, all new variants which became dominant start from somewhere, and growth tends to be exponential in fashion."
3300,"&gt; On top of that, that report is from April 1st and includes data up to March 11th."
3301,"The data is up to the 31st of March as is clearly shown throughout the document, you are probably referring to the previous breifings which go up to the 11th but don't concern what data is included."
3302,Just count the garbage from space.
3303,"&gt;The air being replaced every 3 minutes is nice, but meaningless if it's the sick person next decides to take their mask off because they're ""eating"" the whole flight."
3304,I have flown multiple airlines in 2021 and every time FAs yell at pax if they leave their mask down between sips of water.
3305,"I had a similar sore arm for both shots, nothing really else."
3306,"If you are uninsured, it likely highly unaffordable."
3307,"Actually, it's often unaffordable even if you are ""insured."""
3308,Imagine being this much of a moron - India's population is way younger than the USA on average so their deaths will naturally be a lot less.
3309,"In addition, lesser rates of obesity, diabetes, Vitamin D deficiency and greater exposure to pathogens all play a big role in decreasing its death rate."
3310,Infection rates will continue to spike but I doubt the death rate will get anywhere close to what USA experienced.
3311,They could always lift restrictions earlier.
3312,"Dropping restrictions based off of vaccinations would set a minimum, and could potentially speed things up."
3313,"that's one state lol

fauci says ""we don't know why texas numbers keep dropping"" 🤣

again this will be over in June, and you will be like a deer in the headlights"
3314,Have you not heard of density?
3315,Have you not looked into the fact that the majority of the population in these low-density states live in cities?
3316,Have you not looked into the fact that those cities still have the mandates?
3317,"Texas, Florida, Iowa, Mississippi, Arkansas, all states that dropped the state-wide mask mandate, still with *some* localities having them."
3318,Whence cometh the surge for these states?
3319,what is the actual probability?
3320,I'm sure you are incredibly relieved.
3321,&gt; The Denver counties have indicated they want to remove all health code restrictions on May 16th.
3322,Does that include masking?
3323,[removed]
3324,Sure.
3325,"But before I give it, can we agree that this isn't over yet?"
3326,Not everyone who wants to get vaccinated is yet.
3327,I'll assume we can agree on that.
3328,Let's use a grocery store example.
3329,"You're all vaccinated, great!"
3330,Me too.
3331,"So say either of us want to to to the grocery store, but don't want to wear a mask."
3332,"After all, we're both vaccinated, and if others aren't, not our problem right?"
3333,"Well, what happens when some jackass who isn't taking this seriously, and doesn't plan to get vaccinated gets to the store, sees us walking around without masks?"
3334,"He's going to say ""fuck this, I'm not wearing one either."""
3335,"And now there's a greater risk of spread to others who maybe do want to get vaccinated, but haven't been able to yet, because after all, masks do more to prevent you from spreading illness than they do to protect you from illness, unless you're wearing a properly fitted N95 mask."
3336,"Now imagine that keeps up for a while, and a new variant emerges that our vaccines aren't so great against."
3337,Back to everyone wearing masks.
3338,You want that?
3339,This is a global problem that requires a global solution.
3340,"Just because YOU are out of the woods, doesn't mean everyone is, and unfortunately, adults in 2021 are having a real difficult time acting like adults."
3341,"Set a good example, help others feel comfortable while they wait to get to where we are, etc."
3342,It's really not that hard.
3343,"We're really close, and this won't have to go on for much longer if we don't fuck this up."
3344,I didn’t say they they were sending it to your doctor.
3345,I said it’s recorded somewhere besides the card they give you.
3346,You can still transmit the virus after being inoculated so theres still the potential to kill a loved one.
3347,I take it you get the flu jab every year right?
3348,"Maybe if we had a functioning healthcare system and didn't treat healthcare as an exclusive privilege of the rich, people wouldn't default to assuming that."
3349,"My husband and I both noticed pains in our joints after the first pfizer dose, both in areas that we already had issues."
3350,I assumed that we were having an inflammatory immune response.
3351,Joint pain is listed as a side effect.
3352,I think you are freaking yourself out.
3353,"We did have covid last year as well, my 2nd dose was a cake walk."
3354,[removed]
3355,"You mean Fauci running around with two masks and proclaiming that it's not safe to eat in a restaurant or go to the movie theater, even if you're fully vaccinated?"
3356,"The messaging has been: get vaccinated, masks, and social distancing will continue."
3357,Even the places that are thinking about requiring vaccines still maintain that masks and social distancing will continue.
3358,That is kinda sad he can't handle needles himself lol
3359,"The clots commonly associated with birth control usually occur in the legs, the same as those common in pregnancy, and while dangerous are usually treatable."
3360,The clots from the AZ and JJ vaccines are much worse.
3361,They occur in the brain and are usually fatal or permanently disabling.
3362,The latter are way way more serious.

3376,The only vaccine I wanted to take was the J&amp;J one and they took it away so I gotta wait and see if they'll bring it back.
3377,I just told you the main reason they’re asking is to get reimbursed for administering the vaccine.
3378,"So therefore it will be recorded with your insurance company, but this does not mean your insurance company tells the doctors you see."
3379,But go ahead with *your* general experience with this...
3380,"They’re already requiring it for bills games, and I suspect more sporting venues/teams will add it before the fall season."
3381,"Many if not most American Universities already require vaccines for admission, they will just add this one to the list before fall semester."
3382,Ya depending on the company they definitely might add that to your medical records but the primary reason they are asking is most definitely for the admin fee

3410,There are a lot of good people that work for airlines in the country even if some of the airlines blow.
3411,My insurance also has my vaccine on record within my portal.
3412,They had planned more easing that has now been paused.
3413,I think what you are forgetting is how terrified so many Americans are of engaging with the American healthcare system.
3414,I’m not surprised at all that millions of people don’t know it’s free.
3415,Millions of Americans think of healthcare as unaffordable.
3416,"Sure, but it's still laughable because cleaning is pretty unimportant compared to *sitting less than a foot from a sick person."

3434,As it stands the annual risk of death for my age and sex is 1 in 1200.
3435,"An additional risk of 1 in 20,000 is so small that it doesn't even visially change the overall odds for any given year, this holds true for anyone old enough to receive the vaccine."
3436,When rounded to whole numbers its literally nothing.
3437,I’m right there with you but I’m relaxing this procedure on May 1
3438,"&gt; I'm not trying to come off as argumentative, but this sounds a lot like We don't know if vaccines, even though effective, will actually prevent spread."
3439,It just seems more like yet another reason why we should continue to put life on hold indefinitely.
3440,"It's all good, I enjoy a heated and passionate discussion."
3441,We know vaccines are 95% effective for Pfizer and Moderna.
3442,We know people can still asymptomatically carry and spread.
3443,We know variants can develop and that can evade vaccines.
3444,Why push it?
3445,**No one is saying indefinitely.
3446,** Why are people hearing that?
3447,The original comment is arguing that they're emotional gut feeling trumps the CDC.
3448,The CDC is being rational as a public health advisor.
3449,Anyone re-opening at this point isn't doing it for public health reasons.
3450,Right?
3451,Every single public health official has been consistent about that.
3452,"No one in public health was yelling, ""time to end your mask mandates"" at Texas."
3453,There's not just a public health angle to this thing.
3454,We've had way more death than necessary for the last year because a lot of America has prioritized the p-word you can't talk about here over public health.
3455,That's all.
3456,And we all have different risk tolerances and ideas about what kind of loses we think are acceptable.
3457,I personally think easing restrictions 2 months early when we do have a vaccine is needlessly reckless.
3458,If this were going to continue for 10 more years then fine.
3459,But we know there's a pretty good finish line.
3460,Over 65's are already at almost 80% and still rising.
3461,"I know they have more incentive, but I try to be optimistic."

3463,"Have you ever heard of the term ""density""?"
3464,"Do you know what a ""virus"" does in places with high ""density"" versus places with no ""density""?"
3465,"It's been a year, you should know this by now."
3466,Well my vaccine is recorded in my insurance so that seems to be the reason they’re asking.
3467,So I’m pretty sure that is not true.
3468,They are collecting your insurance because there is an administration fee.
3469,If you do not have insurance the federal government will reimburse whoever is administering your shot the admin fee.
3470,However if you do have insurance then your insurance company will pay the admin fee.
3471,That happened to me.
3472,Hit my head on either a wall or the floor(idk).
3473,I now have a disability that's very likely a result of that head injury.
3474,"Except the risk of even getting the blood clots is less than the risk of covid, assuming worst case scenario."
3475,And the logic is that 1 in 40k is bad odds if everyone takes it.
3476,A lot of people *do* die from cars every single year.
3477,But those odds aren't awful on an individual level.
3478,"I'm sure you have ridden in a car, haven't you?"
3479,"So herd immunity for some, but only small miniature American flags for others."
3480,If I read that correctly the hospitalizations and deaths from that group may not even be Covid related?
3481,"Makes me think that the tiny group that has tested positive is very old, and/or very very immunocompromised."
3482,[removed]
3483,just go live your life.
3484,hell of a lot more things more likely to kill you than covid post vaccination.
3485,It will be interesting to watching things play out over the next year and compare vaccination rates.
3486,I saw a chart showing that 80% of California adults intend to get the vaccine.
3487,I wouldn’t be surprised if that number is even higher in the Bay Area.
3488,So it will be interesting to see how much better they do if cases really start to increase again next winter.
3489,I really hope states stop dragging their feet by planning dates for full business reopenings but not saying anything about a real full reopening.
3490,"If a bar can pack a large number of people in, then there is no reason why masks will be necessary."
3491,"Like I want my state governor to say when businesses will be 100% open AND when all measures will be lifted, maybe not this second but there won’t be any excuse within a couple months."
3492,"No worries, I assumed it was an automated thing!"
3493,Because it’s a good idea doesn’t mean it’s being implemented...
3494,Pfizer and Moderna do not have the rare side effect of blood clots.
3495,They are not the same type of vaccine as Johnson &amp; Johnson or AstraZenica.
3496,Things will be back to normal once we reach herd immunity.
3497,You can be part of that by getting vaccinated
3498,"You're aware the vast majority of people have not been fully vaccinated yet, right?"
3499,Pretty hard to say Fauci isn't data driven when the vast majority of people don't meet the criteria you've arbitrarily selected.
3500,[removed]
3501,"I understand your comparison with the trolley problem, and in general I am on the side that it is wrong to kill a person to save five."
3502,"However, the difference with the trolley problem is that vaccination is voluntary."
3503,"I think the most moral option is to give people all the available information and give them the possibility to make an informed decision, instead of deciding for them."
3504,"Ah I see, I thought strokes were caused by high blood pressure and not blood clots."
3505,Perhaps it’s both?
3506,I’m more concerned about long term effects.
3507,We’ve only been vaccinating for a few months now.
3508,The law firm cites its sources.
3509,Here’s another https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/717043
3510,"If vaccine uptake is lower than desired, just open things up anyway."
3511,Kids are at less risk than the flu; adults who don't get the vaccine are signing themselves up for the risk.
3512,If no breakthrough cases were reported I’d be more concerned about fudging the data tbh
3513,[removed]
3514,"I just got my second shot today at Walgreens, they billed my insurance less than $3."
3515,They're only allowed to recover administrative costs and I don't believe they can deny/charge people who don't have insurance.
3516,"I cannot believe she unironically said ""flatten the curve"" again."
3517,Like everyone is just gonna forget how the last time we took two weeks to flatten the curve it turned into an entire year
3518,We know that COVID is killing people.
3519,We know that vaccines are extremely effective CRT I’ve at preventing deaths.
3520,"Delaying adenovirus vaccinations and vaccinating people with mRNA will delay vaccinations, even if the US can still hit its targets."
3521,That means a certain number of people will die of COVID while waiting for a vaccine.
3522,The question then is how the known risk of dying of COVID compares to the unknown risk of dying of blood clots caused by the vaccine.
3523,"No, we can’t know exactly what the risk of the vaccine is, but we can estimate it based on what we currently know, and ask how much worse it would have to be in order to justify stopping J&amp;J vaccinations."
3524,There are no perfect choices in risk management.
3525,You’re always working with imperfect information.
3526,You have to weigh what you think you know versus what could possibly be.
3527,"In this case, the effects of the J&amp;J vaccine would have to be wildly worse than what we’re currently seeing for the risks to outweigh the benefits."
3528,"And the benefits (preventing COVID deaths) are known, whereas the risks are yet unknown."
3529,No.
3530,They realize.
3531,"When you sit them down, show the plain and simple facts, the response is *always* ""well maybe they shouldn't have wasted money on (literally anything they bought prior to illness)*."
3532,There is no reasoning.
3533,A good third of humanity *wants* to watch the two-thirds suffer.
3534,I knew it was free as I had gleaned that from various things I'd heard before I got my shots.
3535,"However, I must say that I do not recall recently hearing that it is free."
3536,At all.
3537,I went to the ER for a panic attack.
3538,"I:

-	Sat in the waiting room for an hour
-	Talked to a doctor in triage for 5 mins
-	Got an EKG
-	Had 1 vial of bloodwork drawn
-	Got 1 Ativan to calm me down

Total bill was $4,200."
3539,"As if stress, depression, and anxiety weren’t bad enough."
3540,Feeling good...???
3541,Should be feeling great!
3542,These vaccines (particularly the mRNA ones) are turning out to be insanely effective!
3543,"Like this is blowing past expectations, and I for one am giddy about it."
3544,I want to hug everyone who put in the endless hours to make these happen.
3545,Darwinism?
3546,You are only contagious for a while—so that could also explain why nobody got sick.
3547,"But yea, a properly fitted n95 is very effective."
3548,But masks like the average person wears (loose cotton or paper surgical masks) don’t offer that level of protection.
3549,"Naw, that's nonsense."
3550,"I can't even begin to count the number of couples I've seen walking around the past 13 months -- her with a mask, him without."
3551,And now we're seeing the same pattern with vaccinations.
3552,"Zero surprises, a lot of guys are selfish 'tough guys'."
3553,“so”effective... and safe.
3554,not.
3555,i’ve worked in clinical trials and these trials have no controls.
3556,they don’t introduce the actual virus in the trial.
3557,so you’re the trial now.
3558,"I have seen most places, the shot is free but some may charge a fee to give the shot."
3559,The albertsons subsidiary I got it at in Cali made me give insurance info
3560,Healthcare *is* unaffordable.
3561,Anybody who says otherwise actually hasn't been ring through the medical system; or is exceptionally wealthy.
3562,"Okay then, that was always allowed."
3563,I don't care.
3564,Yes  .... more offerings for Moloch.
3565,All according to plan.
3566,Buy Microsoft products.
3567,Try telling her you'll pay any cost?
3568,You know it's free and maybe it'll convince her?
3569,My sister wasn't going to get it until I told her it was free.
3570,"Get the word out, some people just don't know."
3571,"I did not know that, media here is always talking about how bad they are."
3572,Guess it's media confusing people as it likes to do
3573,&gt;To me it just feels awkward to be unmasked and enjoy the services of someone who potentially wants the vaccine but couldn’t secure an appointment yet.
3574,They are getting paid again.
3575,By someone who has 1 20th .the likelihood of spreading covid to them as opposed to some other irresponsible person who didn't get vaxxed.
3576,I honestly recommend going out and enjoying.
3577,"Give the public the data gathered so far about what the risk is of taking the vaccine

Let people decide if they think it's right for them/worth the risk"

3599,You are not correct.
3600,"They can charge *your insurance* for the administration fee if you have insurance, but the provider must pay for all of that and not cost anything to you whether you have insurance or not."
3601,I literally can't because Texas still doesn't let anyone under 65 have it unless they have a pre-existing condition
3602,So people *are* paying for it.
3603,Just with deductibles and price hikes due to having insurance payouts.
3604,Neat.
3605,"Absoloutely agree with you there, but for once I think the US made the right choice in how we acquired and are now distributing vaccine- getting our own citizens protected first, then lessening the burden elsewhere."
3606,"To be fair, we do have the 3rd highest population of any country the world over, so vaccinating ourselves fast is not particularly counterproductive."
3607,If mRNA vaccines are really 90% effective in the real world (as seems to be the case in Israel) then the herd immunity threshold is much lower.
3608,"The US is probably the only country in the world which could globally vaccinate using just our logistics and supply chain expertise, maybe China, but they don't have an mRNA vaccine yet, just in trials."
3609,"Once we get most of the population who wants to be vaccinated, I could easily see us moving into other countries and doing mass vaccination there and gaining back so much of the goodwill towards the US that was lost."
3610,"Yeah I bet 10,000 of them died"
3611,I guess anything is possible.
3612,Mine took 11 mins.
3613,Walked into cvs for my apt..sat down immediately and the guy took 1 min to give me my shot and then I had to sit in a chair for 10 mins to make sure of no allergic reactions.
3614,In and out.
3615,Super easy.
3616,You paying for the air you are breathing right now?
3617,sounds like some things can be free.
3618,If all we are left with is 7mil unvaccinated we've far surpassed herd immunity and we are safe.
3619,Did the public ever embrace that?
3620,Even my most COVID-conscious friends stuck to one mask.
3621,"If I had to guess, we hit a turning point with COVID fatigue."
3622,That sucks and is apparently extremely rare.
3623,"CDC just posted data that says 1 out of every 19,000 fully vaccinated people gets infected."
3624,"So, something very odd about a couple both being infected."
3625,Makes you wonder if they got their vaccine at the same time at the same place and therefore likely to have been mishandled vaccines.
3626,&gt;You are giving something to healthy people without them even knowing about this potential risk.
3627,My stipulation is you let people know the risk before hand and allow them to choose and sign off on it
3628,Exactly.
3629,[removed]
3630,"Well, you were [wrong](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2021-04/05-COVID-Oliver-508.pdf) (p.10, though the ""first"" page 10 is incorrectly numbered, it's the second page 10), it's extremely close to 19%."
3631,such as?
3632,I think kids are much better off not getting the vaccine because its so rare that any have serious complications from COVID.
3633,"Now I get it, they could spread it to mom and dad and gma, but they HAVE the choice to get the vaccine."
3634,"If they dont, its on them."
3635,"Man, you worded that point well."
3636,I will borrow that.
3637,"I feel the same, but it’s sometimes hard to word things."
3638,Probably.
3639,I've had the J&amp;J vaccine.
3640,Can I go get the Pfizer if offered?
3641,"No, like recycle on a molecular level."
3642,You get what you pay for lmaoooo
3643,I am honestly a bit surprised they stopped J&amp;J since it only affected women.
3644,Bless you.
3645,I wish Americans had this mentality.
3646,We are going to be the last ones out of this
3647,Unless you don't pay taxes
3648,A law firm.
3649,Seriously?
3650,"But wouldn’t the reason be that we are reopening, and yet they are not getting vaccinated while the rest of us are?"
3651,Hence their rates have increased while ours have not.
3652,"Oh and just to further back this up:

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2036242

This is from the Pfizer study, effectiveness tested 7 days after."
3653,Good on you but not absurd.
3654,That’s the reason we’re in this position in the first place tbh
3655,I’d rather bill my insurance.
3656,"Pay up, Blue Cross."
3657,"I did however, tell someone who didn’t have insurance “You don’t need fucking insurance.” when the pharmacist tried to make it seem like they needed it to get the vaccine."
3658,"If you’ve ever been to India, social distancing is impossible."
3659,Like literally can’t be done.

3664,Just use the address of where you’re currently staying
3665,Well...
3666,I understand it may be hard to transition to a pre covid world but at some point it just has to start.
3667,If you get vaccinated you aren’t posing a risk by eating in doors.
3668,Oh baby that’s illegal
3669,"It's crazy, this is a literal article about the vaccine being free and there is still so many people in the comments saying something along the lines of ""I got the vaccine and am waiting to see how much the bill ends up costing."""
3670,"Much lower than expected, I'm guessing some other infections also occurred but were so mild they went unnoticed and unreported."
3671,Not even 0.01% of total vaccinated people
3672,[removed]
3673,Usually your state holds your vaccine records.
3674,I requested mine from GA the day after my shot via email and they sent me a full print out of my vaccines from birth including both covid shots + the lot number of the Pfizer for free.
3675,Now I have a backup in case my card goes missing
3676,Well it’s not burnt if they pay out it full.
3677,So your classifications are wrong.
3678,Also idk what insurance you have.
3679,"I’ve had 2 of the majors in the last ten years, and I’ve never had much trouble."

3684,[removed]
3685,I did on Monday and I would do it again even knowing what I know.
3686,The risk seems extremely low and them taking precautions on such a small subset of people having serious complications just makes me trust the vaccines even more.
3687,I’m also a female and in my 30s.
3688,People are dumb
3689,"Hmm, i realize we’re not docs or scientists in here (me at least), but by recycle does that mean if it was the thing causing blood clots, that the issue could still come up even further down the line (years)?"

3691,Endangers is a bit strong.
3692,Its somewhat more risky.
3693,But going to the story for non-essentials is more risky than staying at home.
3694,Is going to Target ENDANGERING yourself and others?
3695,The political shitfight has lead conservatives to refuse to accept that masks are a fairly easy way to reduce risk.
3696,But it also has lead liberals to believe mask are much more effective than they really are.

3717,"But if you end up with scenarios where hospitals are getting to capacity, any state that is taking a science based approach will absolutely consider additional restrictions."
3718,"Yeah, I’d classify weeks/months of worry over whether you’ll be on the hook for a massive bill as “burnt.” Even if they pay out in full, it sure makes you never want to use your insurance unless you’re damn near dead."
3719,[removed]
3720,Precisely right.
3721,"To be honest I’m not quite sure, and don’t want to give medical misinformation, if anyone can link to this information from the Pfizer clinical trial please do, the CDC just lumps information so that wouldn’t actually be helpful"

3724,This is mostly image reactionism from countries.
3725,"Decisions are run by media and public voting opinion, and not by math or science."
3726,Same thing happened with nuclear power in places like Germany.
3727,"They essentially ended their whole nuclear program after Fukushima, which meant replacing it with coal and gas, which in turn SINGIFICANTLY increased deaths due to carbon pollution."
3728,But they can say they reacted in kind to the Fukushima for the safety of the people...
3729,"So if it safe for kids, in the closed space of the classroom, it must me safe for everybody, no?"
3730,Or kids are vaccinated already??
3731,"Let’s ban outside gatherings 6 feet apart, and take everything in the small(class size) interior spaces, where you can be 3 feet apart!"
3732,Much safer according to CDC.
3733,"Also, I have seen a report that one person in my state (TN) is having clotting complications from the J&amp;J vaccine while the state health department says that no patients in TN are among the 6 with clotting complications."
3734,"This leads me to believe that there are more patients with these complications, similar to the fact that covid was clearly spreading in the US weeks before it was officially acknowledged to be."
3735,I'm absolutely pro vaccine &amp; have had the 1st moderna dose myself.
3736,I'm also absolutely pro pausing J&amp;J to study the side effects more and even eliminating it if necessary to vaccinate the country as safely as possible.
3737,I agree we should be.
3738,Canada's government years ago decided they would not prioritize their own pharmaceutical industry and they let the industry they had leave for other countries.
3739,"Even if Canada threw several billion dollars at the pharmaceutical industry at the beginning of the pandemic, that would not be enough time to build up the factories, r&amp;d departments, etc needed to bring them on par with pfizer."
3740,Those things cannot be done quickly and take time.
3741,"It is why it is dangerous to allow all of your critical industry to leave your country, and it is why the US also maintains certain industries in the US."
3742,"For example, circuit fabrication and battery factories will never fully leave the US due to national security concerns."
3743,"Even if we had to literally burn money to keep those industries here, we would just to have them on hand if a war or other international disaster were to occur."
3744,To the point we should be building factories everywhere and governments everywhere should be financing it for the current and future safety of their populations.
3745,You may want to check your math.
3746,"...

...you win this round!"

*ding!"
3749,"* 

Glad to see the broadening realization and acknowledgement that people are, by and large, done complying, and any more lockdowns and restrictions are pointless."
3750,"Walensky’s suggestion to close down and “go back to where we were last spring” is asinine and laughably out of touch, especially with so many at-risk people already vaccinated."
3751,"She and the other people making such suggestions would be better off not suggesting it at all, because it’s only going to turn more people off to whatever she wants to say."
3752,The social end of the pandemic is here - better get used to it.

4 PM - feeling oddly good, temperature 99.8
6 PM - feeling okay, get food delivered to my

7 PM - taste and smell completely gone, but a new cough
Just now - temperature 98.7

What is going on?"
3758,(For the record - Last Thursday and this Monday: negative Covid tests through work
3759,Unfortunately there are still places and pharmacies charging people for it.
3760,"No idea why or how, but it’s quite literally not free in certain places."
3761,My own government is still pushing the vaccine a lot and saying it's safe (the astra zeneca) yet Denmark is just saying fuck it I don't want it.
3762,Conflicting information.
3763,I don't like it at all.
3764,Thanks for that.
3765,The vaccines target the spike protein.
3766,There is only so much variation that can  occur before it can no longer infect human cells.
3767,Its just not a concern.

3852,Oh that's a relief to hear it's mostly under 60?
3853,She's safe I hope then.
3854,Do you know any particular symptoms we should look out for?
3855,I'll Google them anyway but just in case you know.
3856,"I agree it, that all makes sense to me :) Thanks for the helpful summary."
3857,I'm surprised there's been so many comparisons in the media between contraceptive induced clots so people are rightly pointing out the difference between the clots.
3858,But it seems Covid itself can also cause this more serious and scary sounding CVST and it has even affected healthy young people.
3859,I had no side effects after the second Pfizer dose.
3860,First one I had minor flu like symptoms and a crazy sore arm 24-48 hours after
3861,Herd immunity via exposure + the virus mutated into less lethal strains like influenza A
3862,[This polling](https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-march-2021/) is more recent and breaks down the responses into more categories.
3863,"Percentages look much better, with ""Definitely not"" at 13% and ""Only if required"" at 7%."
3864,"Meanwhile the ""Wait and see"" category is steadily shrinking."
3865,The genie is out of the bottle.
3866,"The social end of the pandemic is here, like it or not."
3867,Yeah but very recently.
3868,Some other people on my floor aren’t

3870,"IMO way way worse if it looks like the CDC is hiding something and it comes out later that it causes clots, rather than them being open and showing how the process works."
3871,"That's for the first year of ""typical use,"" for women whose intended method at the beginning of the year was condoms."
3872,"It includes women who sometimes don't use a condom because they ran out, or didn't have one with them during a hookup, or their partner begged to go without because it just feels better, etc."
3873,"If you use condoms consistently and correctly, they have a 2% effectiveness rate."
3874,"That's 1 in 50, not 1 in 6."
3875,You can improve that somewhat by using Plan B if the condom breaks or slips off.
3876,"Health care providers do tend to prefer to have their patients use longer-term birth control, or, failing that, birth control that's taken every day rather than used in the heat of the moment, because there's less room for that inconsistent or imperfect use - they know their patients are human."
3877,But this is where knowing yourself and your partner is important.
3878,I'd be inclined to agree.
3879,"I also think that in Michigan, they should continue to administer J&amp;J to anyone who wants it."
3880,I find every part of the US healthcare system a scam.
3881,Dont get me wrong the canadian system isnt perfect we need to fund it better.
3882,But I've never waited for anything and never spent a dime other than parking.
3883,But won’t taking blood thinners be a one way street?
3884,Once you start you can’t stop because your body will adjust to the thinner blood and stopping would suddenly increase pressure and increase risk of stroke?
3885,What about Canada?
3886,"Shaming people for being hesitant about an experimental unapproved drug only being given for emergency use with known health issues that can cause death, a bit reckless of you no?"
3887,Sources please?

3889,"Of course the real experiment that matters is the actual mass vaccination rollout in each country, and with the US still seeing 20-30 times the number of daily cases and deaths compared to the UK (majority vaccinated with just ONE dose of AZ), you really have to wonder how effective the Pfizer vaccine actually is?"
3890,I would love to have you tell me more.
3891,"I generally feel cautiously optimistic about post-vaccine life, but it's hard to feel certain."
3892,Hell yeah!
3893,I've walked over 300 miles in 2021.
3894,No gym membership.
3895,Most of those days it was below freezing too.
3896,Does this really matter after someone is fully vaccinated?
3897,It's a total scam.
3898,"The US: don’t always make good decisions, but will solve bad decisions with technology, at 10,000x the cost if the mistake was avoided in the first place."
3899,"Oh well, at least that money spent is going back into the economy somewhere... sigh."
3900,But the reason they are continuing the pause is because we don’t have all the numbers.
3901,Half of the 7 million J&amp;J shots were given out this week so we don’t have a full picture of the rate yet.
3902,Hence why they are waiting to make a decision to see if more cases happen.
3903,It apparently takes 6-14 days to see the clots happen so we need to wait until everyone who received the shot is out of that window.
3904,San Diegian here and I just got dose 2.
3905,"I’m extremely nervous about medical things, but got through it."
3906,Beaches and beers soon.
3907,You're worried about blood clots?
3908,The condition is very rare and mostly observed in women under 60 so she's not at great risk.
3909,Just monitor for symptoms for a couple weeks.
3910,You can also talk through your concerns with her doctor.
3911,What's their hospital bed utilization?

3917,"They said ""extremely effective"" which is a true statement."
3918,"The next response said ""90% effective"" which is also a true statement."

3933,"In fact, she’s more likely to die if she doesn’t get vaccinated."
3934,“CDC continues to recommend at least 6 feet of distance...In community settings outside of the classroom.”  It makes you wonder how 3 feet is safe in a classroom.
3935,It seems like they relaxed the rules due to schools being so critical to keep open and the impossibility of keeping 6 feet of distance in many classrooms.
3936,And maybe taking into consideration the low risk of serious illness in children.
3937,"There is a curve, some particular aircraft tend to lean on the nose heavy end while empty, some on the tail heavy end."
3938,If we have a full flight typically we can trim out the CG with minimal trim.
3939,"However, aircraft that have a light load typically are touchy and more sensitive, and if everyone is at the back or front we can see some anomalies."
3940,For the most part though lighter loads give the aircraft better performance.
3941,"It’s a combination, but usually we can get the passengers and cargo in the optimal spot so then the issue becomes how much weight there is."
3942,"Please let me know if I need to explain further or if you’re confused, this is a great question and I wanna make sure you get the answer."
3943,You’re basing this on the anecdote of the world’s most infamous country for handling Covid?
3944,Really?
3945,A shitty lockdown is better for the economy than no lockdown at all and that holds true especially when you look beyond that dumpster fire.
3946,Canada’s economy has responded incredibly more positive than the US.
3947,"And it’s not just that they have shitty lockdowns, half their population is actively rebelling against any sense of reason."
3948,Furthermore the regions that did more lockdown had a massive bias toward blue areas and as a result a heavy bis to cities that are several times more population dense than the “open economy” red regions that greatly benefited from a sparse population.
3949,"That’s not to mention again the half of the population actively undermine their efforts, much of which reside outside of the cities and totally undoing the efforts that were made to lock down."
3950,I’m sure there’s a hell of a lot of nuance more than that but regardless the US is still an anecdote and still an example of a country that hardly locked down at all in many circumstances and had a measurably worse death toll per capita as well as a significantly worse economic impact than most of the rest of the developed world.

3978,We're 3rd in the G20 in people vaccinated and will be 3rd in the G20 in total doses shortly.
3979,People whine that we're behind UK and USA who both have a significantly amount of capacity to manufacture their own vaccines.
3980,"Is there any concern that as the number of vaccinated people increases, so does the test positivity rate?"
3981,Just by merit of vaccinated people not getting vaccinated while the ever-shrinking pool of unvaccinated people continues to get tested.
3982,"If Dr. Fauci himself published a peer-reviewed answer to that question in a respected medical journal, would you believe him?"
3983,Would you even understand it?
3984,"Ok, so then why are you asking?"
3985,"This was hidden in that earlier AP/NORC poll from mid-February that a lot of people cited to generalize about ""vaccine hesitancy"":

https://apnorc.org/projects/safety-concerns-remain-main-driver-of-vaccine-hesitancy/

Some have noted 15% of all adults said they were certain they would not get vaccinated."
3986,"Alternatively and contrasting the overall adult hesitancy, 7% of people 60+ yrs old said they were certain they would not get it."
3987,"50.7% of all adults had not committed to getting a vaccine (86% unvaccinated of which 59% combined would... (only) probably get a vaccine, probably not get a vaccine, or definitely not get a vaccine)."
3988,"13% had been vaccinated already, including 9% (72% of those 13%) having just one shot, and 1% of those 9% = 0.1% not planning to receive all required doses."
3989,So ~51% of adults had not committed (yet) to being vaccinated.
3990,"Of those 51% uncommitted, 35% thought other people needed it more than them at that time, 10% were concerned about cost, and 7% had not been recommended by their doctor (all together 52% about cost, doctor, and priority, of those 51% uncommitted)."
3991,"So the fraction of all adults who hadn't committed to vaccination included ~26.5% of adults who were waiting for their doctor, their turn, or the cost."
3992,"The new guidance accounts for that, since it'd possibly be zero feet if kids couldn't spread it."
3993,3 ft is a logical compromise for a group that can spread the virus but isn't at risk because 6ft is a lot to ask in some classrooms.
3994,People want to be free.

3999,It sounds like your body is reacting normally to the vaccine.
4000,"The clotting problem, which is exceptionally rare, doesn't show up until a few days later, if I'm not mistaken."
4001,And it mainly affects women.
4002,"&gt; I don't blame you if you're in the US, and you'd prefer for yourself to get a mRNA one due to these issue, even if that causes a slight delay of a few weeks at most."
4003,"People have their own risk tolerances, and one can't really argue with another's personal risk tolerance."
4004,This is really all it is for me.
4005,&gt;You're comments went far beyond that though.
4006,"So for that specific comment you quoted, that's a fair criticism of yours to make."
4007,"My intent was a reaction towards how... unsympathetic it felt to me to just say, *oh well let's just give those to India and we, the '1st world' will get the mRNA*."
4008,"However, after considering it, I realize these people were more likely saying that the cost/benefit for these countries that are facing much worse infection rates than we currently are would likely make the nominal risk worthwhile."
4009,Especially if they may not have access to mRNA vaccines any time soon.
4010,I acknowledge that I likely misinterpreted that.
4011,"&gt;Or where the CDC said the J&amp;J was ""irresponsibly developed""?"
4012,What I was pointing towards is that **if** it turns out that they knew there was a risk of blood clotting than that would be highly irresponsible.
4013,As they could have simply moved over to mRNA full-time.
4014,"Still, I should have been more careful about splitting my specific issues away from those I was basing off the CDC reports."
4015,&gt;Also stop acting like the CDC / experts are some monolithic entity.
4016,"If you listened to the meeting today, there were plenty of experts saying the J&amp;J decision is a disaster."
4017,The whole resolution of the meeting making no recommendation is because the committee couldn't come to a decision due to internal disagreement.
4018,There were clearly members that wanted to immediately resume for certain demographics due to the relative risks.
4019,"Okay sure, but I think we can both agree that putting a simple halt was the responsible move here."
4020,"There is a clear, albeit small trend."
4021,It is the FDA and the CDC's responsibilities to ensure that medication and vaccinations reach certain standards prior to public consumption.
4022,"Again, these are vaccinations that may reach the billions."
4023,"If 1 in 40,000 is relatively close, that's a massive loss of life."
4024,One that could be avoided by altering our path forward in regard to vaccinations.
4025,"One thing I want to make completely clear, I am pro-vaccination here."
4026,This isn't the polio vaccine though.
4027,It's a unique form of vaccination and with that uncertainty comes many variables that we can't always prepare for.

4034,"Here in Seattle, the giant vaccine site in the stadium's only running two days a week because it can't get any more supply."

4054,"Have you forgotten the existence of vaccines or the data showing that covid risk to kids is very low, as I keep citing"

4106,"I'm pointing out, that the EU is still exporting vaccines."
4107,BCBS and Cigna are already covering costs for COVID tests and associated visits.
4108,The admin fee for the shot is charged to insurance and paid by them regardless of if you've met your deductible.
4109,It completely goes around those requirements.

4115,My immediate family is now almost fully vaccinated a long with a lot of my extended family :-)
4116,I think we partially agree.
4117,"We both want life to get back to normal for kids, but maybe we think that process looks different."
4118,Should adults get vaccinated?
4119,"Absolutely, we’re in agreement there."
4120,But what does being mindful of community spread look like?
4121,"If spread rises, do you cancel school sports and ban socializing with more than three households?"
4122,That’s just subjecting kids to more harm.
4123,"Yes, children are part of “everyone.” But this virus also poses little risk to children, so it makes sense that we return to normal before kids can get vaccinated."
4124,Parents who don’t want their kids to participate in normal are always welcome to make that choice for their family.
4125,Not an option for me.
4126,I get random drug tested for work.
4127,"Right but to date

* 32,143,423 unvaccinated people have gotten covid
* 564,000 unvaccinated people have died
* 5,800 vaccinated people have gotten covid
* A handful (source needed) have died from covid after getting the vaccine

Obviously the timelines are vastly different since the vaccine has not been around 13 months like the virus, but any way you look at it there can't be criticism on the efficacy."

4138,Trying to explain that to someone who is already pretty low-information and distrusting of bureaucracy isn't going to help convince them to go get vaccinated.
4139,"Let's just say it's ""free"", ok?"
4140,&gt;Well timed message as hospitalizations in FL are on the rise.
4141,tl;dr: WINNING!
4142,there are over 100 million doses of pfe and mnra vaccine that have been shipped by the manufacturers to the federal government that are just sitting on warehouse shelves while everyone argued for months about how we can't just give them out to anyone because then a peleton instructor might get one before a 50 year old.
4143,10 million jnj doses are irrelevant in the scheme of things we are well at the over supplied stage its just all you muppets haven't realized it yet.
4144,This was the entire point I thought.
4145,The vaccine wasn’t going to make you never get it.
4146,It was to make the symptoms not so severe.
4147,So working as designed then?
4148,Cuz that's the end result of what people look like when they fall off their bike going fast with no gear on.
4149,"It makes sense that they want people to bring insurance cards, because the insurance companies are paying for some of the vaccine costs."
4150,"But, it shouldn’t be on the people acting as a third party to bring insurance cards for the insurance company to get charged."
4151,Only the US has a bit of a bigger problem considering who was president for the last 4 years
4152,"Wow, these side effects after the second Pfizer shot are intense!"
4153,"I’m a 21 yr old guy and I have a fever, chills, headache, lower back pain, and my joints are killing me."
4154,"It’s all worth it though, in 2 weeks I’m going to every club and restaurant in sight!"
4155,"Yes, always my question."
4156,"How was the severity, and how many people were hospitalized?"
4157,Age range and underlying conditions seems to be a major factor.
4158,So much data to go through.
4159,But UAE inoculated  older adults and those with health issues with Pfizer.
4160,"&gt;“True normalcy” in the age of a deadly pandemic = constant sickness and death

Perpetual war for perpetual peace!"
4161,I will admit I went in wondering if they would ask for insurance.
4162,"Figured it would be free (assumed, hadn't heard anything on the news or anything were I live) but was also prepared to give my information over to get it if I needed to."
4163,[removed]
4164,I feel like they can't just schedule one day where everyone has the chance to get the vaccine all the same day.
4165,"My manager told me that if we were given a chance mid shift, feel free to let them know and they will let you leave cause they know we have to take care of ourselves and being understaffed for a day isn't bad compared to multiple if sick or worse."
4166,I just made my appointment on my day off and had my days off for 2 days next just in case of side effects.
4167,I already had it off cause of school.
4168,Why are they doing so poorly?
4169,Shouldn't they be equally afraid of affording a hospital stay if they get infected with COVID-19?
4170,The thought of shots scares the piss out of me but I've had no issue with having people poke holes in my face.
4171,Same deal with my mom though.
4172,She's a phlebotomist.
4173,"I’d personally venture a guess at 2, 4, and also that perhaps some of these cases were before vaccines took full, major effect (approximately three weeks or so)."
4174,"Sounds good, let’s prevent all “avoidable” deaths in children."
4175,"When born, they should be separated from their mothers, to avoid the risk of abuse, and placed in a facility with 24/7 CCTV monitoring."
4176,"The staff will wear hazmat suits, and the children will only be allowed to play in padded rooms."
4177,They will receive education and training then only be released at 18 after graduation.
4178,"This will prevent children dying in car crashes, from abusive parents or through maltreatment."
4179,"If you oppose it, you find children dying preventable deaths acceptable."
4180,How many need to die before you will care?
4181,"And yes this is a over the top straw man, but hey so is your comment."
4182,"It's not going to ""end"" in the sense of zero cases, it sounds like the virus will become endemic like the common cold or flu, just with far worse consequences for those who aren't immune."
4183,They really just asked my wife if she had it because in our questionnaire there was one about blood and clotting disorders or something.
4184,I think they were just concerned that someone might need special attention if they were a bleeding risk.
4185,I didn't get the impression that it was related to the vaccine.
4186,"&gt;And now those vaccines are going to the people who would've gotten J&amp;J, when they would've otherwise gone to someone else."
4187,"that is not true... and that is what you are missing.... we are not at full capacity... we have decent supply thanks to pfizer...  all 50 states have enough capacity to offer vaccines to every adult... i made an appointment yesterday for a shot this saturday....

unless there's some massive bottleneck within the next two weeks.. everyone who wants a vaccine will get one in america with or without jnj....

the problem.. and it's not even that big of a problem... is if the delay runs longer than a month or two or three or indefinitely.... but that's probably not going to happen unless there are larger issues... and if there are larger issues then you're not going to want the jnj vaccine anyway...."
4188,"&gt; At some point we just have to say ""The vaccine is available, if you want to be protected go get it."""
4189,"And if someone doesn't, they're just taking a risk, much like motorcycling without a helmet."
4190,This is absolutely the case.
4191,"Once you have the opportunity to get the vaccine and you decide not to, it's over for you."
4192,"At that exact moment, it's no longer anyone's responsibility to protect you from this - you made your decision, you live with it."
4193,"And once the vaccine is readily available enough that that describes 99% of people, then... we're done."
4194,"There are a couple of major caveats with that though -

* The vaccine has to actually be available."
4195,"I believe Michigan, for example, just opened its eligibility to all adults like one week ago and it's still really hard to get an appointment in most places."
4196,So plenty of people there still have not had a reasonable opportunity to get it.
4197,* There is a lag time of ~5 weeks to actually be immunized (or at least 2+ weeks for the decent protection of the first dose).
4198,"It's not reasonable to open eligibility to everyone and then immediately go ""k lol vaccine is available, pandemic is over"" because people need a bit of time to get an appointment and then actually become  immunized once they've received it."
4199,"But when all is said and done, it doesn't matter whether we reach herd immunity or not."
4200,"Once 99% of American adults have had the chance to get immunized, then I don't see any legitimate argument that we should continue living like this, whether or not we've reached that big 70% or 80% or whatever."
4201,"In my state, we have seen basically no local news clearly stating its free, and the online registration required insurance information with zero indication that it would be free."
4202,If I had not been a Redditor I would have thought we had to pay if I didn't have good insurance.
4203,As it was I still wasn't entirely certain with the way registration was.
4204,"I assumed it would be covered by insurance but would not have been particularly surprised by a copay, even though I knew the government was *supposed* to pay for it."
4205,"Arizona, for reference."
4206,"But sadly, I don’t fall in the range."
4207,"Even though the BC government advertised AZ for people born in those years, I found out by booking and tuning up for a shot that you have had to already turned 55, not just born in 1966."
4208,So I am back in the general queue!
4209,Pisses me off that some people who are in that range and can get AZ are choosing to wait and therefore making others wait longer.
4210,"As of this morning, the BC Covid vaccination page still said had this misleading info  in the banner at the top of the page."
4211,I went over a week ago and was refused.
4212,I imagine others have too based on the info being put out by Bc.
4213,[removed]
4214,[deleted]
4215,Doesn’t have to be perfect.
4216,The media has made this pandemic so much worse and caused untold damage with their constant doomsday scenario’s.
4217,They’ve become a truly despicable institution.
4218,How is the situation in Canada?
4219,"California specifically opens up  vaccination availability to everyone 16 and up tomorrow, so I’m excited about that."
4220,"I know Canada doesn’t domestically produce any vaccines, but where are you guys in the process?"
4221,Hallelujah
4222,No one thinks it's controversial to put children at risk to covid once everyone who needs a vaccine is vaccinated.
4223,"The controversial part is putting them at risk BEFORE the vaccines are out, then announcing that you'll continue to do the same thing in 6 months."
4224,Keep up.
4225,If that is the case that still would mean the vaccines likely decrease you chances of severe infection ergo GET A VACCINE IF YOU CAN!
4226,"I'm British, and can read between the lines."
4227,I get what you're saying.
4228,"But from my perspective it is more difficult to lock Americans down than Europeans, so you had that going against you."
4229,"But America is good at throwing resources at things, so that's been going well for you."
4230,I don't know how you managed to infer that from anything I've said.
4231,"I watched someone die from TTP, so I know how miserable it is, the pause to investigate is part of good science, AND I think the relatively low risk as reported is outweighed by the benefits of the vaccine."
4232,That would assume everyone can schedule appointments at the same time.
4233,"B.1.1.7 is infectious enough that, with ~30 percent of the population vaccinated, the US is approximately where it would have been without vaccines or B.1.1.7."
4234,"We should start to see a real turndown in US cases when vaccination rates reach 50%+, as other posters have mentioned."
4235,That only applies if you are a foreigner.
4236,Japanese could come and go relatively speaking.
4237,"Easier to get that work done without Covid., it actually in HRs best interest for you to have a shot so you don't have downtime."
4238,Incredible.
4239,The vaccines wipe out covid to less likely than the flu.
4240,"Key section:

“By midnight, everyone in California ages 16 and up will be eligible to book COVID-19 vaccine appointments on the state’s MyTurn appointment system."
4241,The changes to the system were expected to go into effect sometime late Wednesday and be completed before midnight.
4242,"At that point, the rest of California’s counties will join the rest of the state in allowing all adults, as well as 16- and 17-year-olds, to book COVID-19 vaccine appointments."
4243,"In Southern California, residents of Orange and Ventura counties ages 16 and up will be newly eligible to book vaccine appointments through MyTurn."
4244,"Los Angeles, San Diego, Riverside, San Bernardino, Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo and Imperial counties have already made everyone 16 and older eligible."
4245,"Residents of the following counties will also be eligible to book appointments for everyone 16 and up through the MyTurn site by Thursday morning: In the Bay Area, residents of Santa Clara, San Mateo, Sonoma, Solano, Marin and Napa counties; in the San Joaquin Valley, residents of San Joaquin and Tulare counties; in the Sacramento area, residents of Sacramento and El Dorado counties; and on the Central Coast, Monterey, Santa Cruz and San Benito counties."
4246,"All residents 16 and up of Tuolumne, Siskiyou, Amador, Lassen, Glenn, Del Norte, Colusa, Inyo, Mariposa, Modoc, Sierra and Alpine counties will also gain access to appointments."
4247,"MyTurn officials said the online system can handle up to 300,000 transactions per hour, and that they expect it to handle demand."
4248,Officials planned to release a new version of the MyTurn website Wednesday night with the new eligibility and include language support for the first time in Arabic and Farsi.
4249,"People can also make appointments by phone at (833) 422-4255, with language support for more than 200 languages."
4250,"The MyTurn website is an attempt by the state to produce a main gateway to find and schedule appointments, but sometimes, not all available appointments show up in the MyTurn system."
4251,"Alternate ways to book appointments include through healthcare providers, such as Kaiser, and pharmacies that offer vaccines, such as CVS, Ralphs, Rite Aid, Walgreens, Costco, and Albertsons/Vons/Safeway/Pavilions."
4252,"The city of Los Angeles has a separate vaccine appointment portal, operated by Carbon Health, that is not integrated into the MyTurn system."
4253,"All vaccines are free to everyone living in the U.S., regardless of immigration or health insurance status."
4254,Officials were optimistic that the vaccine rollout will not be affected too much by the recommended national pause on distribution of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine.”
4255,This post appears to be about vaccines.

4258,*
4259,"Should not be controversial at all  if we educate ourselves on covid risk to children, but I guess that’s not something we do round these parts"
4260,""" marginalised groups where take-up of the vaccine is lower ""

\- I have no sympathy for groups that are ""marginalsed"" by their own choices."
4261,"In fact I would argue self-choice means its not ""marginalisation""."
4262,"It would me madness if the law prevented us moving in certain directions just because a minority said ""no""."
4263,Lol Canada is going 16 weeks after first dose you’ll be fine.
4264,Most things would have run the way it has had been running since forever.
4265,"Here's a few things that wouldn't have happened if the pandemic weren't there:
1."
4266,"People wouldn't have spent time at home with family members, which is good assuming the family is functional
2."
4267,"Most people now know the value of saving money for the longer run, in case of times like these
3."
4268,"Companies wouldn't have realized that work from home for longer periods of time is actually a possibility
4."
4269,"The lockdown gave us some time to retrospect and work on ourselves, which otherwise wouldn't have been easier to achieve
5."
4270,"It made us prepare for the worse, which might be yet to come!"
4271,I think it has to do with the amount of travel from outside in those particular areas.
4272,"Alberta, BC, and Ontario have a higher amount of American travellers because of Alaska and Ontario being a big business hub in the same vain as New York or California."
4273,Basically you can tell how American a Canadian city is by the number of Apple stores.
4274,"They probably do, tbh."
4275,Though I don't know how credit scores work in Canada.
4276,"Either way, the company that owns this place is apparently one of the centers for covid deniers in Canada (at least in BC), so it isn't unexpected, I guess."
4277,"&gt; In terms of efficacy and and safety we know already

No we do not."
4278,Older population getting vaccinated combined with Denmark having relatively good control of the virus which is a big factor.
4279,If infection numbers go bad at some point this decision will be revisited.
4280,Some people don’t keep up with news.
4281,It's really not as can be seen in germany
4282,"&gt; I still don't understand what would motivate anyone to ban someone from a gym for *being vaccinated*, though."
4283,"Some kind of fucked up ""virtue"" signalling to other like minded morons would be my guess."
4284,"Those single digits were young people that thought like you ""I'm taking this to help society and be safe"" only to end up in the grave because of it..."
4285,"It is totally valid for people to be afraid of a certain vaccine that has caused clots in the brain and a low platelet count for reasons unknown, and that seems to affect one gender more than the other, specially if they have a medical history that will make them more susceptible to clots."
4286,"Yep, and its just the media running with one soundbite to create a clickbait article."
4287,"Sure, [this study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.29.21250653v1.full.pdf) looked at antibody titres of people who have had covid + one vaccine vs not had covid + 2 vaccines, but also compared the side effects of the two groups and found they were similar."
4288,Additionally [this study](https://covid.joinzoe.com/post/vaccine-after-effects-more-common-in-those-who-already-had-covid) by the ZOE covid group in the UK has found a similar effect.
4289,This was with the pfizer vaccine so was unlikely to be an immunogenic response to the adenovirus vectors.
4290,Also sorry my wording probably came across dismissive I was just trying to explain why some people tend to experience more severe side effects but that they aren't harmful and actually a sign of a robust immune memory.
4291,"They might as well ask who you voted for, your credit score and your mother's maiden name"
4292,In terms of efficacy and and safety we know already.
4293,Your not liking it changes nothing.
4294,Wtf?
4295,They are saying so themselves and are ordering it LOL
4296,Well what else would you expect.
4297,"Till today, there is really no real hard lockdown."
4298,"Only leisure activities seem to be prohibited, work in offices still goes on."
4299,"Some cities have a 9-5 curfew, but that is not enforced at all, and even if it were there are the 'personal excercise/walking my dog' excuses."
4300,"Parties have shifted from bars and pubs to houses, and people just reach before 9 and stay till 5."
4301,"Unfortunately not at all surprising, and I think the situation will get way worse before getting any better, mainly due to continued government inaction."
4302,"What is needed is a hard lockdown, and I mean  a real hard lockdown, where you are arrested if you step out of your house for anything other than essential shopping, like it was in India in the early days."
4303,ps: with regard to the PPE comment they never said masks did nothing and they did say they didn't want to impact public supplies.
4304,I got it from public health.
4305,But LoL at asking what the cost is!
4306,No one truly knows until it’s processed by insurance.
4307,I learned this after spending hours on the phone trying to get an estimate for a CT I got in February.
4308,It ended up being less than I thought so that was shocking and nice.
4309,But no one would tell me what I’d need to budget until after it was done.
4310,The pharmacy staff is always cool about letting me pay the $15 cash price instead of the $87 insurance price for my meds.
4311,It was a pharm tech who suggested it.
4312,Why do they care who pays for the vaccine administration?
4313,"Disclaimer: The vaccine is free, but there‘ll be a fee for each infection prevented for the rest of your life."
4314,"Since there is no way to know this, we settle for a flat rate of $500/year."
4315,I feel like reasoning for continuing restrictions is getting mighty thin.
4316,We should have capacity limits for businesses because there is a chance for a new variant that will evade the vaccine even though currently no variant does and since we can’t control the rest of the world this virus is going to continue to mutate anyways?
4317,Or is the reasoning for capacity limits is because we are so “close” even though we have flattened the curve for hospitals and vaccinated the most at risk.
4318,Just sort of feels like there is crowd who doesn’t want to let go of having some sort of lockdown or restrictions.
4319,They don’t want it to switch to personal choice for every individual.
4320,CDC makes a lot of recommendations that people don’t follow exactly.
4321,I think this is no different.
4322,Its not lying though.
4323,It *IS* the right emphasis.
4324,It is the lockdown thats behind the reduction in cases.
4325,The vaccine has reduced the seriusness and hospitalisations.
4326,"Right, but we would not be doing that testing without being supremely confident."
4327,"That’s why child trials are starting now, a year after adult ones and after over 1% of the planet has had the vaccine, not last year."
4328,Let’s not forget UPenn from which the candidate was derived
4329,Yeah Canada was a perfect little utopia before that
4330,Extreme confidence still has to be tested.
4331,[removed]
4332,"&gt; It will absolutely let us go back to normal, though when is a valid question."
4333,The more people hesitate to get vaccinated the longer it will take unfortunately.
4334,But yeah the great thing definitely is that all of the vaccines work and were developed in record time.
4335,It really is quite an achievement.
4336,"Yeah, it's looking like both Denmark and Norway might end up refusing the use of adenovirus based vaccines."
4337,Thereby significantly delaying the vaccination program in both countries.
4338,"On the other hand, with more research into the sideeffects we might still use the vaccines."
4339,"As it's currently only younger women that have been affected, to my knowledge."
4340,+ American.
4341,Thank you UPenn!
4342,"It isn't that they can't shut them down, it's that they don't have a business license to revoke, because the one they applied for was denied since they're clearly against public health regulations."
4343,"They've been ticketed multiple times for operating without a business license and disobeying public health orders, so the next step is almost certainly going to be in court."
4344,"Unfortunately, courts are very backed up worldwide, so I'm not sure how long this would take to go through."
4345,The question is whether kids have a risk of long covid symptoms.
4346,"That’s unknown, and those are no joke."
4347,"Given that I believe the car ride to a vaccination site is much riskier for a kid than the vaccination, it’s a no brainer."
4348,That’s how I feel about vaccination.
4349,Worrying about it isn’t healthy.
4350,Covid is another matter.
4351,"Again, what is the 7 day average?"
4352,You've already crushed COVID.
4353,You have it far below the daily average deaths from a bad flu season.
4354,So it doesn't make sense to be locked down at all.
4355,"If the US was at 200 deaths a day, we would be fully open."
4356,We fret about deaths.
4357,If we had your daily deaths we would have been open a month ago.
4358,200 739
4359,Obviously not dying of Corona gives one an unfair advantage.
4360,"&gt; The US is the only major vaccine producer not exporting any vaccines

Not true."

4369,&gt; and getting my kid the shot.
4370,Massively safer than getting covid.
4371,I am in no way against vaccination.
4372,not in general at least.
4373,we still decide on whens it reasonable an when its not.
4374,"kids have (and thats not negiotiable, its a scientific fact) way more to fear from the seasonal flu than from COVID."
4375,"here in germany its recommended (not really, its more like a mention) that kids get flu shots."
4376,most don't do it as the risk is still very minimal.
4377,its even less for COVID.
4378,just saying that people should not overreact or feel unsafe when there is no real reason to.
4379,"thats not healthy behavior, mentally speaking."
4380,"Ah you’re right, misread it there :p still pretty damn impressive"
4381,How different would things have been if the pandemic never occurred?
4382,"I know it's a simple, probably stupid, question, but I'm intrigued to hear y'all's take."
4383,Obviously there would be no COVID/pandemic and things would hopefully be smoother.
4384,But how different would 2020/Q1 2021 have been if COVID never happened?
4385,What do y'all think?
4386,"It's really important to remember this, and I have to remind myself of this when it feels like we are so behind."
4387,"4, 5, 6 weeks feels like a long time but it's probably because I am still largely restricted to my house and grocery store and the days are getting longer (sunlight)."
4388,"My entire US family is vaccinated at this point, I am partially vaccinated but only because I have a chronic blood disease."
4389,Nobody else my age is being vaccinated in my country.
4390,"&gt; Sputnik V is one of the best vaccines in the world

We will see."
4391,"&gt; Luckily, many countries in the EU will be using Sputnik V

Because... You said that?"
4392,Imagine being racist
4393,Think Covid would affect your work far longer.
4394,As in years
4395,This really annoys me considering that there are many poorer countries with more wiling recipients.
4396,"Japan is actually starting to have more cases than my country now, and its heavily suspected to be under-reported due to insufficient testing."
4397,I can fully understand and not mind that they get the vaccine ahead of us.
4398,But to see them just lying idle and not using it...ugh...
4399,"At the current speed, the US will hit herd immunity just in time for July 4th, and current speed is likely not the maximum yet so that point might well be earlier."
4400,Judging from everything we know Covid is not going to be a huge issue in the US this summer.

4428,Like a boss he stuck me on the first go.
4429,I was just stunned at how he got it right the first time.
4430,I don't know for sure but I think some nurses got a reaming out after I was admitted.
4431,On the bright side I had bruises on my arms.
4432,It looked like I'd lost a heavy weight champion fight.
4433,I joked with my friends that my bf beat me.
4434,The look on his face was priceless.
4435,He's the most timid person ever and would never lay a hand on me.
4436,(partly bcs he knows I have no issue laying him flat if he tried but mostly he's just not that kind of person.)
4437,I'm actually totally fine with this.
4438,Temporarily.
4439,Yup this will also be forced onto people who can be urged to get more dangerous vaccines because of their higher risk to have covid complications due to age.
4440,"They also have a new plant in Marburg, Germany!"
4441,Pfizer/Biontech are really saving us.
4442,"Yes, but we don’t start testing it on any kids until we’re incredibly confident it will be safe for them."
4443,That isn’t the same thing as certain.
4444,"We’ve given these vaccines to a substantial percentage of the entire planet’s population, with no significant issues."
4445,We’ve given them to large studies worth of slightly older kids.
4446,"Both are reasons to be extremely confident they’ll be fine for younger kids, and that’s why they’re doing the studies."
4447,There isn’t a magic difference between a 15 year old and a 16 year old which makes the vaccine only safe for one of them.
4448,And that extends down the line.
4449,"If it’s been fine in the study of 12 year olds, it almost certainly won’t cause problems in 10 year olds."
4450,"If I had a 14 or 15 year old, I’d absolutely be looking for a vaccination site that wasn’t bothering to check IDs, and getting my kid the shot."
4451,Massively safer than getting covid.
4452,Afaik 60% of cases in Mumbai are from the new double variant
4453,It seems they're just restating and clarifying.
4454,"We've heard so much conflicting advice about distancing in US which may also have been given in UK, e.g., studies have shown 3' apart is ok for schools, that it's good to be reminded that essentially nothing has changed regarding aerosol Covid."
4455,&gt; the base for the main vaccine that the USA is applying now?
4456,Moderna is not that behind lol.
4457,"Yeah, as somebody pretty far from being vaccinated, I don't get the idea that this is a bad thing."
4458,"Sure, there's a lot of stuff I can't do right now, but why should I be mad that people who are fundamentally different in terms of health risk to themselves and others can?"
4459,That would just be spiteful.
4460,"In addition to that, allowing vaccinated people more freedom in turn allows them to keep small businesses, bars and restaurants afloat so that the rest of us can enjoy them when it's out turn."
4461,Quite true.
4462,This seriously could be a breakthrough on the level of antibiotics or variolation.
4463,That’s why I can’t get the degree of pessimism or instance it doesn’t work.
4464,"It will absolutely let us go back to normal, though when is a valid question."
4465,"It absolutely blocks almost all infection, it’s just a question of what tiny percent it doesn’t."
4466,Same with transmission.
4467,"If the best vaccine we got was 70% effective, we’d be thrilled."
4468,And half of this sub is sure this miracle won’t do the job.
4469,you have that backwards.
4470,you test it on SOME kids to make sure its really safe for ALL kids.
4471,"in germany a total of 12 kids, ranging from 0.9 have died."
4472,out of 3mio cases.
4473,thats with or from COVID.
4474,the risk of dying or adverse effects from COVID is so neglectable that a vaccination is effectively redundant for kids.
4475,"if it makes you feel safer and better, go for it."
4476,I support peoples informed decisions.
4477,wether or not I approve.

4486,"This reading is actually what we assign to first-year undergrads in an introductory molecular biology course that I TA, and it's typically pretty well-received."

4489,Thanks!

4492,I got the Pfizer vaccine and it's pretty cool knowing that I have a part of history running through my body.
4493,"But yeah these mRNA vaccines are the biggest breakthrough since the mapping of the human genome, which was a huge advancement in and of itself."
4494,India?
4495,Not at the time though.
4496,That's pretty much how it is here.
4497,They prefer you try and schedule on your day off but they'll put you in for vaccine time off including up to three days unpaid with no attentence penalty if you do miss work due to adverse reactions.
4498,Plus $100 once you have had both shots and your card to confirm.
4499,It's a very difficult and time consuming task.

4501,"And avoiding healtcare makes it more expensive in the long run, which is one of the reasons why the USA has the highest cost per person for medical care."
4502,Free market makes things cheaper right?
4503,Right?
4504,Don't they already?
4505,I thought it was just an even lower risk than J&amp;J and astra.
4506,but children can pass it onto family
4507,Regarding J&amp;J I have a hard time figuring out how Denmark is going to use  it when we won't use AZ.
4508,Denmark ignored the large dataset for AZ in the european adverse effect database EudraVigilance and relied on a much smaller danish/norwegian dataset with relatively more severe cases (but very few in absolute numbers) to arrive at the conclusion.
4509,So how can we use J&amp;J based om EMA approval when we don't trust EMA to analyze and evaluate adverse effects correctly?
4510,"1-2 severe cases was enough to tip the use of AZ for at total of 150K vaccinations given in Denmark, so how can anyone guarantee that?"
4511,Just report him.
4512,Who would have thought that producing a cheap and effective covid vaccine at cost would end up being bad PR?
4513,I don't know how to break this to ya ...
4514,But we aren't what we were a few decades ago.
4515,"US govt is all about red tape and saying ""eh good enough""."
4516,"""well run government program"" is LOL at best."
4517,The ONLY reason this one is doing okay is because we are throwing an absurd amount of money at it.
4518,Probably paying 5x more what an efficient system could do with similar results.
4519,I look at the USPS and think it's a massive waste of money and should be eliminated.
4520,If you're still relying on daily mail youve gotta be like 90 years old at this point.
4521,Imagine buying a stamp and mailing something?
4522,Feels like using a telegram or something.. foreign to me.
4523,Anyways It's easy to do 4 hour waits for vaccines with retired people and teachers out of work.
4524,Trying that with 30 year olds who won't even get sick from corona anyways?
4525,Yeah good luck.
4526,Please give me definition of severe case in both Sinovac's and J&amp;J's trials.
4527,"The statistic about risk of AZ clots is wrong, in the press conference they said it was 1:40.000, which may be due to danes being more genetically disposed than others."
4528,"But I respect you for changing it sir, kudos"
4529,I know its free but why do they ask if you have insurance?
4530,My sister and her husband got their first shot and on the form it asked if they had insurance (they do).
4531,I understand answering some questions pertaining to health but if its free why ask about insurance.
4532,"The Pfizer vaccine is still being tested at these temperatures, so that could change."
4533,"For those who are as desperately lacking context on this as I am, this is London, Ontario."
4534,"Still worth reporting but not as earth-shatteringly different from the narrative as it would be if this were London, England."
4535,"The bigger London actually has less than twice as many daily cases, despite 20 times the population."
4536,The flair is therefore misleading.
4537,No.

4539,"Aside from *maybe* some hospitals, nobody has installed ventilation systems in order to curb Covid spread in enclosed buildings."
4540,You can hardly expect a business to have a window  or their door open.
4541,"And we’ve known that the primary mode of transmission is the airborne aerosol form for just under a year (really it seemed obvious the whole time), and what has been done to address this?"
4542,"I used to, but there are now 180 covid related bookmarks (that were formerly tabs), so I gave up."
4543,74 deaths/5800 infections sound really bad...  Perhaps the 5.8k infection count is a significant undercount.

4554,I've (26M) had the Astrazeneca vaccine about a month ago.
4555,All my family and friends have too.
4556,The only side effects I experienced we're feeling tired for 1-2 days.
4557,Nobody i know has any significant side effects.
4558,I will be getting my 2nd jab as soon as I'm offered it.
4559,Many of us are getting vaccinated now.
4560,I would think any further shutdowns would be unfair to those of us who have become fully vaccinated and have immunity to the virus.
4561,"At some point we just have to say ""The vaccine is available, if you want to be protected go get it."""
4562,"And if someone doesn't, they're just taking a risk, much like motorcycling without a helmet."
4563,"There’s only one aircraft that I know without a recirc fan and that’s a CRJ-200, not sure where this no recirc thing is coming from."
4564,"Sure there’s a filter in there, but there is absolutely recirculated air that’s mixed with the bleed air."
4565,That said I think most people don’t even understand that bleed air exists so I agree with most of what you said.

4568,They’re probably confused by the fact that the vaccine centers ask you to bring proof of insurance to get the shot
4569,"OWS was a great policy to secure doses that is benefiting us now, but Trump didn’t have any major distribution plan."
4570,"To be fair, I suspect that’s mostly because Trump stopped doing any semblance of his job after losing to Biden (which is a huge red flag in and of itself), so we’ll never really know if he would have formulated more of a plan had he won re-election."
4571,"I, at least, am glad we never had to find out."
4572,people vacationing here too
4573,It takes time for the vaccine to work.
4574,No rush!
4575,It's not like thousands of people are dying from not getting the vaccine.
4576,50 percent is not going to cut it.
4577,"That will not get us to herd immunity, and again, this is JUST the dominant strain right now."
4578,We need to be at 70 percent or more for herd immunity.
4579,"Until we have achieved that, any discussion by policy makers of what life might look like after COVID should begin and end with “Let’s wait and see.” 

Americans are dumb and shortsighted."
4580,"We want what we want, and we want it yesterday."
4581,But viral pandemics don’t care what we want.
4582,"They don’t care about the economy, or jobs, or how we are tired of Zoom."
4583,Viruses only care about spreading and mutating.
4584,We still need to focus on that.
4585,I get that it has been a year of hell.
4586,It has been a long slog of 12 months.
4587,But people need to realize that there is no expiration date.
4588,"If we don’t want many more deaths, we need to make decisions based on science, not based on the economy or boredom."
4589,"I’ve been telling people all along: If all your customers die, how will you keep your business open then?"
4590,"If 30 percent of your students die, how will it be in your classroom or school then?"
4591,We are better at predicting the path of hurricanes and the strength of earthquakes than we are at predicting the path and mutations of this virus.
4592,And we’re not great at getting people to evacuate before a deadly storm or before a 7 Richter quake hits.
4593,And it’s one thing to have been contrarian/pessimistic about the vaccine when it wasn’t a real option for you anyways.

4637,But people deserve to know the risks and dangers no matter how small and make their own mind up.
4638,It’s also confusing because in Texas they ask for your insurance card during the sign up process.
4639,Before you get an appointment you are supposed to provide your insurance information.

4642,"I agree that kids should have to wear masks at the very least in schools until they are able to be vaccinated, but I don't like this 'no deaths' rhetoric, like people are going to die from covid, so yes some amount if acceptable."
4643,"100-200 kids die from the flu every year, with the mrna vaccines being so effective and covid likely being less deadly than the flu that number should be lower, but it won't be zero, not even for kids"
4644,Hospitalizations or MIS-C aren’t fun as well.
4645,Plus we don’t know the long term effects yet.

4676,You'll never find out.
4677,The only way to know is to have the procedure and get a bill.
4678,"Could be a couple $1,000, could be a $25,000."
4679,Spin the wheel.
4680,This is all because insurance companies want to negotiate discounts with service providers in exchange for making them in-network and sending them customers.
4681,"Hospitals can't really afford discounts, so they instead jack up the base price and then discount it back to what they actually want to charge."
4682,"Now understand that there are a lot of insurance companies, and they each have lots of different groups, and each of those gets different negotiated rates, etc."
4683,All those rates are secret because insurance companies don't want their competitors to know what they're paying.
4684,"Because the hospitals inflate their prices to made up numbers, huge numbers of insured people can't afford their bills."
4685,The hospital makes up for this by passing the cost on to insurance companies for the insured and we're now in a vicious cycle of price inflation.
4686,"The law should be changed so that medical services must be billed at exactly the same rate to all customers, no matter what insurance they have or don't have."
4687,I think all companies should send out emails to their employees and encourage them to get vaccinated and say that IT IS FREE!

4717,"&gt;In a statement, the Danish Health Authority emphasized that the shot's benefits outweigh the risks for those who do get it, but said they had decided to discontinue its use because of its possible link to rare cases of blood clotting and the ""fact that the COVID-19 epidemic in Denmark is currently under control and other vaccines are available."""
4718,"The European Medicines Agency and World Health Organization both continued to recommend its use, and many of those countries resumed vaccinations within a few days following a preliminary EMA investigation that concluded its benefits outweighed its risks."
4719,"Wednesday's announcement comes exactly one week after the EMA said rare blood clotting events should be listed as a possible side effect of the AstraZeneca vaccine, but stressed that it has been proven to prevent severe disease, hospitalization and death from COVID-19."
4720,I tried for over a year to get my insurance company to commit that a mandated 100% covered procedure would actually be covered at 100%.

4746,Basically it’s payment for their time and resources.
4747,The Trump administration was also getting doses to the states in significant numbers.
4748,Vaccine production and delivery was always going to ramp up.
4749,"It is no point, you have made your points graciously, some people just don’t want to understand."
4750,The guy is completely ignoring seasonality too.
4751,It'll be different for every state
4752,"We had tripled the amount of J&amp;J we were using last week, now it’s down to zilch."
4753,I suspect the pause will definitely hurt Michigan the most out of any other state as a result of that + the situation we are in rn.
4754,I’m lucky I got my J&amp;J last week.
4755,"It’s very hard to find appointments in the Detroit metro area atm, especially if you don’t have access to a car."
4756,"Edit: or at least it was difficult to find one last week, not sure how it is now though"
4757,Not really.
4758,Kids already have a habit of not wearing their masks correctly at school.
4759,Go to a Trumpy city/village.
4760,No queues
4761,I guess the next step is to pay people money to take it...
4762,Yet another article says we have 50% of Americans over 18 vaccinated already....
4763,What a wonderful time to live in Taiwan!
4764,I envy the fast response that shut out Covid before it became entrenched.
4765,That makes sense that the positive was from lingering traces from his illness in December.
4766,It is surprising traces are still found after so many months.
4767,&gt;all it took was someone taking it seriously.
4768,Or vaccine production and delivery to ramp up.
4769,Cant cure stupid
4770,Have you seen how much they hate Europeans over there?
4771,They are not happy at all.

4779,"Goodbye, Doug Ford."
4780,I mistakenly got flu shot 17 days after my first pfizer shot.
4781,When can i get the second pfizer shot?
4782,14 days after the flu shot?
4783,Or do i have to start over altogether
4784,I started a new job and don't have insurance until July 1.
4785,"Can I still go to walgreens, vs,  or rite aid and get one free?"
4786,Older republicans aren’t the fucking boomer nut jobs on Facebook.
4787,They still believe in medicine.
4788,It’s the 45-65 age range Republicans that are going to go for broke on the anti-vax
4789,I mean is it more risk?
4790,Out of what’s been given shots for Johnson you’d have like a death rate of .000014% in the US and with even just 20-29 if we are talking young getting it to worst vaccine wise covid has had a death rate of 0.2% to those that caught it.
4791,-this is ignoring all the known long term damages it can cause-
4792,You came at me about things I never said.
4793,Go take a walk.

4808,Not an asshole.
4809,The US gets shit on all the time here.
4810,It’s nice we’re actually doing something right during this whole covid thing.
4811,So yeah I’m bragging.
4812,They bill far more parties than that.
4813,"Check your local state portal, even the CDC has a decent list under vaccine reports."
4814,You know all of the other ways children die that you listed are already governed  by extensive safety regulations.
4815,The Florida state government hasn’t come out and said “car seats aren’t mandatory for babies” - that’s because we all recognize the need for protection.
4816,"School buses and traffic near them as well as school zones have safety protections of speed limits, distance to stopping, requiring kids to be seated, etc."
4817,"It’s not a reasonable comparison to say children shouldn’t be protected from Covid when the federal, state and local governments have extensive regulations protecting them."
4818,Finally
4819,If you don’t get vaccines often you might not know.
4820,"Besides Covid vaccine, I just get a flu shot every year which my work offers for free anyway"
4821,&gt; Indiana is begging people from other states to get the shot so their numbers don’t look like shit.
4822,"I don't doubt you, but where are you seeing that?"
4823,I'm in Indiana and was eligible to sign up 2 and a half weeks ago and literally signed up for the first available appointment....which was today.
4824,"I have other friends who have theirs over the weekend or next week, and they are the same age as me."
4825,"Now maybe living in the Indy area skews that, but there's definitely still demand."
4826,Any source on the 17% thing?
4827,"Following German media, I never heard that"
4828,They aren't charging the recipient.
4829,They bill the insurer to get some of the administrative costs of giving the shot.
4830,"It's right on the CDC website:

“COVID-19 vaccination providers can: Seek appropriate reimbursement from the recipient’s plan or program (e.g., private health insurance, Medicare, Medicaid) for a vaccine administration fee""

4832,I'm just really glad you're not in charge.
4833,[removed]
4834,How exactly do you get burned by insurance?
4835,Read and understand your benefits and they can’t burn you.
4836,They asked for my insurance and primary care physician.
4837,But I didn't know my insurance company and I don't have a doctor.
4838,They said it didn't matter and left it all blank🤷‍♂️

4840,"We had like 4 months of strict lockdown, it has paid off."
4841,[removed]
4842,The FDA also has to take into account future public confidence in the medical system.
4843,"In a hypothetical USA where J&amp;J was the only vaccine available, I would agree with you, because delay could easily cost tens of thousands of lives lost to COVID versus just hundreds of lives saved due to holding off the vaccine."
4844,"In a USA that has plentiful supply of safer and more effective mRNA vaccines, I edge more on the side of holding off on J&amp;J, even if it costs a few hundred lives in the short term."
4845,"If we continue to push a vaccine with known issues when we have better alternatives already available, antivax sentiment will be fueled for years."
4846,"""Earth could be wiped out by an asteroid strike"""
4847,"It works both ways, the employer could require being unvaccinated to work from home, and then demand you show proof of being unvaccinated or come to the office."
4848,They just can't ask your doctor.
4849,I got paid by my work to get mine…
4850,"With respect, the person you’re responding to never made the argument that the vaccines weren’t extremely effective in stopping infection altogether."
4851,"&gt;	Exactly, none of the vaccines are **intended** to prevent infection entirely."
4852,"It doesn’t matter if I catch it now, it’s not going to jeopardize my health in any significant way."
4853,They made the point that it wasn’t the initial intent.
4854,Which it wasn’t.
4855,The initial intent of any of the vaccines was to reduce severity of symptoms and reduce hospitalization.
4856,"We’ve always known mRNA had a really good chance at also reducing transmission, but that always required more data, which we’re getting."
4857,"They’re also making a completely factual, valid, and accurate point even if you disregard my above point; that the vaccine doesn’t prevent infection entirely."
4858,"Even if you’re basing the efficacy off of the 95% number, that’s not 100% and that’s not “entirely” is it?"
4859,"Point is, we’re seeing a really strong effectiveness from the mRNA vaccines in particular and that’s great, but they don’t prevent infection entirely."
4860,No matter what way you look at it.
4861,Acclrdong to the Dutch government it is more deadly than covid for young women.
4862,About 1/100k-1/500k will die from either.
4863,Here in America everybody gets the vaccine if they want.
4864,I got a Pfizer vaccine yesterday and I’m not at risk at all.
4865,My friend went out to eat last night and they were offering vaccinations at the door if you wanted.
4866,[removed]
4867,Thank you for the reply.
4868,What.
4869,I had no idea it was free.
4870,I thought it was free for people on medicaid and all that but I didn't know it would be free for everyone.
4871,"Hm, I guess I'll have to try to get it then!"
4872,I think all of them should be vaccinated.
4873,"But if you are concerned with the Great Replacement conspiracy, wouldn’t you want to stay healthy so you won’t be replaced?"
4874,When I was at Walgreens they asked for my insurance and asked if I was the cardholder.
4875,Dude looked like he had to type info from my card into his computer
4876,The population of London is about that of Michigan (or of Pennsylvania if you’re counting the metro area) to give a comparison.
4877,"I’ll be honest, I have it and I didn’t know it was free"
4878,I live in America and got a vaccine easy.
4879,Anybody gets one here for free if they want.
4880,I’m just trying to point out the fact that there is still time for surges to occur again.
4881,Because it wasn't rushed through testing.
4882,"Redditors also desperately want kids to be at much higher risk of serious illness from covid than they actually are, apparently

Didn’t realize the easily-googleable statistics on just how low the risk is to children is a pOliTiCaL pOsItIoN"
4883,Me as well.
4884,I guess the CDC just lumps things together and people don’t actually look at the study or data.
4885,The JJ pause won’t have a significant impact on the vaccination rate.
4886,"Pfizer and moderna supply are about to exceed demand, and will have enough for everyone in the country."
4887,"Also, all current research points to the idea that each of the 3 vaccines are pretty much effective against any variant and that it won’t be that problematic."
4888,As for herd immunity?
4889,People are absolutely welcome to not get vaccinated if they want to.
4890,"I may think they’re an idiot, and i won’t feel sorry for them if they get covid, but i’m getting vaccinated to protect myself and other vaccinated people."
4891,I’m not going out of my way to protect anti vaxxers.
4892,"Time for PSAs on every radio station, commercials, YouTube ads, etc.."
4893,"You do all your reading on Newsmax, I’m guessing."
4894,I guess you’re not the owner of a gym that reopened despite lockdown orders that closed all the gyms.
4895,"Not much of a stretch to imagine a huge number of his customers — healthy young males in their 20s to 30s — dying of COVID, particularly in light of the fact that the gym owner is a Trump sucker who thinks masking is a liberal lie."
4896,"That same cohort is at risk of “long COVID,” like a friend of mine in her late 30s who couldn’t walk more than a few feet for six months."
4897,She’s still in respiratory therapy 10 months later.
4898,She hadn’t had so much as a cold in 15 years.
4899,Or the church choir that held rehearsals despite their better judgment.
4900,A bunch of its members died.
4901,"I don’t know why I bother giving you examples, though."
4902,They’re everywhere.
4903,You see them or you don’t.
4904,You might not believe them until it happens to your preschool class or your bar crowd.
4905,"Numbers don’t matter that much, either, until the one healthy guy who gets it and spends a week or two on a vent is you, or until the healthy infant who gets it is your baby daughter."
4906,"Since you’re still “rolling your eyes so hard” at facts, and the science that says WE CANNOT PREDICT where we will be in the fall, I’m wasting my  time with you."
4907,Stay safe and healthy.
4908,You’re important to someone.
4909,[source](www.google.com)
4910,No bill will come.
4911,If they bill you they are violating federal law.
4912,"If a bill does come, call them and they should cancel it."
4913,"If it comes to this, your insurance company is required to fully cover it."
4914,But I seriously doubt you’ll get a bill.
4915,You should take what a random person on reddit says with a grain of salt.
4916,You are hearing second hand information.
4917,I could randomly say that everybody in my workplace caught covid even though they were all vaccinated and people would run with it.
4918,"Unless this is confirmed elsewhere, don't take it too seriously."
4919,"as someone who also works in healthcare, i can also tell you that the actually administration of the vaccine is like $0.10 

not that it isn't about the principle, but yeah, just for knowledge sake"
4920,Watched some pinky and the brain the other day.
4921,We still tell the exact same healthcare jokes today.
4922,I know about 12 people who got tested for covid19 and two of them had to pay for the tests.
4923,"There are two large testing sites in our county, yet when you google ""covid test free"" they don't pop up."
4924,You have to know someone who knows where it is and that it is free...
4925,I had an adverse reaction from the first Moderna vaccine.
4926,"This is a valid concern now after two doctors visits, two urgent care visits, a dermatologist visit, and two er trips one via ambulance because I collapsed."
4927,"The entire time being told ""it's been six days, you shouldn't be having a reaction"" when you can have a delayed adverse reaction from both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines up to 8 days later."
4928,(TLDR I broke out in full body hives and started having breathing problems and no one could figure out what was wrong with me so they drowned me in steroids that I also had a bad reaction to).
4929,This past week has been a freaking nightmare.
4930,They just changed it today and removed the age restriction in Canada
4931,I live in Canada and I saw an article headline that said something like “why you shouldn’t turn down astrozenca vaccine”
4932,Hasn’t been good for J&amp;J over the last few years.
4933,"In my experience, vaccines are free if you are insured."
4934,It’s preventative care.
4935,"You may be billed for administration (less than $100), but that’s never been my experience."
4936,Typically I get the flu shot every year and it’s totally free.
4937,Children who aren’t covered by insurance can get vaccinated for free under the Vaccines for Children program.
4938,Medicaid also covers all child vaccines so that they are free.
4939,"What team had more than ""a couple of players at a time"" or shut down for more than ""a week or two""?"
4940,We're way beyond reason at this point.
4941,"The ""stay home or grandma could die"" crowd is to the point of ""I'll gladly sacrifice you and your grandma because I'm too fragile to be alone any longer."""
4942,It's fucking sad.
4943,"COVID tests were supposed to be free too, but if you have insurance you get a bill later."
4944,"It’s not a lot, but I’m not surprised people don’t know the vaccine is free."
4945,What sucks is that some won't get it because they're doubting it or they're conspiracy theorists.
4946,Humans suck.
4947,"Our vaccination rate has been fantastic but we JJ just got put on pause for who knows how long, variants are already becoming dominant strains, and a very large percentage of the population are hesitant or straight out refuse to get it."
4948,"The vaccines are incredibly effective, but we’re still ways away from herd immunity."
4949,It’s a race against time .
4950,Where I got mine that had busloads of people coming up from Mexico.
4951,They asked for my personal info and that was it.
4952,They were desperately getting as many people vaccinated as they could.
4953,i might ask for an empty vial if they can.
4954,would be a neat pandemic souvenir years from now
4955,Parents being required to approve of BC does not necessarily mitigate this.
4956,There are plenty of holes in my own family tree beyond my knowledge and I am sure others could say the same.
4957,If your dad bounced like mine did that's a whole half of your family you don't really know about and mom may not either.
4958,By contrast requiring parents to be involved creates new risks for patients.
4959,There are very conservative/religious families out there who would flip if the topic even came up.
4960,Kids could end up physically/emotionally hurt and maybe homeless.
4961,Not strict at all
4962,I think it’s really important to track Israel’s vaccination rate and create a threshold off of that.
4963,"Once we hit that level, states should reopen completely and (eventually) remove mask mandates."
4964,We’re at a point now where we need positive vaccine messaging (which is valid and true) to convince people on the fence.
4965,"As for people that don’t want the vaccine, that’s their choice and need to live with the potential consequences."
4966,I was just wondering why they were holding off.
4967,"It was my first time at the hospital and I didn't have the necessary information right away so they just charged me directly, once I got the insurance information to them, then it paid for it"
4968,"My vaccine site didn’t have us show our cards to anyone, or enter it online when we made an appointment."
4969,By the end of spring at the latest is my expectation/hope.
4970,If you think the US is going to keep covid restrictions after most adults have had their vaccines I think you will be in for a rude awakening
4971,I think it’s more that many of us who can be vaccinated have been vaccinated so no
4972,It was just talk to minimize the amount of anti-lockdown people letting their guard down and buy some time for the vaccine to do it's thing.
4973,You sound like one of our American patriots.
4974,No more sacrifice for the great good of society.
4975,Obviously if you don’t want to indoor dine for whatever reason after you get the vaccine that’s your choice.
4976,No one’s gonna force you to eat at a restaurant.
4977,Looks like she even has a diagram of why PPE doesn’t work.. smh
4978,"Kill the Grand Poobah, eliminate even the toughest stains!"
4979,"Astrazeneca is refusing to even apply for an EUA, but also put it in the contract that the US isn't allowed to sell the doses, so there's really nothing the US can do about the situation."
4980,"The doses they already distributed to Canada and Mexico were technically ""loans"", and were still potentially a violation of the contract."
4981,"Hey can you explain why cases are going down, or should I?"
4982,You’re not very good with numbers.
4983,There’s these cool things called “fractions.” They can be converted to these things called “percentages” when you multiply the “fractions” by 100.
4984,"Check out the wiki for “multiplication.”

So, there’s also a concept called “time.” It gets a little confusing when you’re talking about theoretical physics, but for the purpose of this discussion, check out your watch or the clock and calendar on your phone."
4985,"This is “time.”

So like, you can compare “percentages” over “time” and come to a “conclusion” that *democRATS* are “full of shit” with respect to this issue."
4986,"It’s all very abstract, but give it a go!"
4987,!
4988,thats a lotta ugly infected dudes.
4989,With beards.
4990,"Like, isn’t blood clot caused by other pills too?"
4991,This comparison seems to happen because the side effects from the vaccine are more common for the young women (who are in one of the least risk groups from the virus) and they need to be convinced for what’s essentially a self sacrifice for quite a lot of them.
4992,Imagine getting a $5K bill for an epidural almost a year after your baby was born!
4993,Yes that happened to us.
4994,Still worth every penny though.
4995,If you mean this specific trial try here:  https://www.covidvaccinestudy.com
4996,I would still wear a mask in businesses that require it and around people I'm not familiar with for the sake of not making other people uncomfortable.
4997,"Other than that, I agree"
4998,And federal employees.
4999,My dad worked for USPS and I gotta be honest our insurance when I was a kid was pretty freaking good.
5000,I had a screw put in my broken elbow by a top surgeon and including the ER trip when the injury first happened I think the whole thing cost 500 bucks.
5001,"I don't blame you if you're in the US, and you'd prefer for yourself to get a mRNA one due to these issue, even if that causes a slight delay of a few weeks at most."
5002,"People have their own risk tolerances, and one can't really argue with another's personal risk tolerance."
5003,You're comments went far beyond that though.
5004,"&gt; Hell, there’s tons saying let’s give them to poor countries."
5005,"Like, really?"
5006,We should give the dangerous vaccines to the poor so we can have the proper ones?
5007,Many poor countries do not have any mRNA vaccines available.
5008,They absolutely must consider the balance of risks because there isn't a readily available alternative like the US has.
5009,This is what I was specifically addressing.
5010,"Also, point me to where the CDC said the vax was dangerous?"
5011,"Or where the CDC said the J&amp;J was ""irresponsibly developed""?"
5012,Also stop acting like the CDC / experts are some monolithic entity.
5013,"If you listened to the meeting today, there were plenty of experts saying the J&amp;J decision is a disaster."
5014,The whole resolution of the meeting making no recommendation is because the committee couldn't come to a decision due to internal disagreement.
5015,There were clearly members that wanted to immediately resume for certain demographics due to the relative risks.
5016,Does that number go down as time goes on before a second dose?
5017,Good points.
5018,I’d also add that if we let the virus spread completely it will also raise the risks of a mutation that evades our vaccines.
5019,"We’re not done with this thing until cases are negligible, not when most adults have had their vaccines."
5020,Covid March Madness
5021,Why would he pay for it?
5022,It’s free for everyone in the US.
5023,He doesn’t have to be a citizen.
5024,Undocumented workers are eligible.
5025,"Man, do guys like you have to make everything about how much you hate the libs?"
5026,You're exhausting.
5027,Media should be reporting that it has a smaller chance of clots than fucking birth control
5028,Scientific evidence that vaccine hesitancy strongly correlates with low cognitive ability.
5029,Beautiful.
5030,Nothing is free.
5031,And maybe those people just don't want it yet either.
5032,They likely want to take the conservative approach and keep this going until there's a shot for kids.
5033,Not saying I agree with it but it's the direction they seem to want to go in.
5034,Why are you implying that the country as a whole will have a resurgence despite an exploding vaccination rate?
5035,Maybe you aren’t anti vax necessarily but you are totally neglecting the efficacy of this vaccine.
5036,It’s more efficacious than essentially every other vaccine that exists.
5037,Lol limiting capacity somewhat
5038,"My understanding is that the vaccine is free, but they can charge you for administering it."
5039,Is that correct?
5040,"fauci doesn’t really know either, he’s taking an educated guess and setting the bar high so people don’t have the mindset that they won’t need to get vaccinated for the country to hit herd"
5041,It already has.
5042,"We just don’t know it, because everyone there is DEAD!"
5043,obviously /s
5044,Tl:dr-im drunk.
5045,Who the fuck doesnt know this shit.
5046,"Its the 24/7 news cycle, you cant turn on the radio without hearing a fucking bullshit CV commercial, and no one will stop talking about it."
5047,"😡

Yeah i used an emoji, and yes im mad as hell."
5048,"If you dont know this shit, you dont need a shot, because you have zero risk of catching the CV."
5049,You do you.
5050,"In the words of the late Tupac Shakur, “fuck everybody, thats why i”"
5051,"Yes, it’s covered by the CARES act."
5052,"They will ask for insurance info because they would like to bill the insurance company for the administration of the vaccine, but it is available and free for you, insured or otherwise."
5053,"I mean, yeah, a few weeks."
5054,But there’s absolutely nothing unreasonable about eating inside a restaurant after being fully vaccinated.
5055,There’s nothing unreasonable about hanging out with groups of other vaccinated people without masks either.
5056,It’s the vaccines job.
5057,"heavy emphasis on ""right now"""
5058,18 months long was my initial guess in January
5059,I did this as well last week.
5060,Phase 2 but able to schedule for this week (before it tech it opened up).
5061,I got my first dose there yesterday.
5062,Jealous Canadian here.
5063,I’m not refusing until the virus goes away... where did you get that impression from my post?

5067,Most Midwest states have pretty small populations tbh
5068,"Fun fact, you CAN walk into a CVS right now and get your vaccine for free."
5069,"So if the issue is big government, which is the dumbest excuse I've heard, just call CVS or Walgreens and get your shot."
5070,You don't even have to pay them because it is fully covered by the government which you oh so hate

5076,Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) if you have any questions or concerns.
5077,*
5078,"Over 40% of the vaccinated population is 60+ years of age, so the death rate from COVID will be skewed higher due to the increased risk of death associated with age."
5079,This is why the UK/US governments should reconsider their stand on the temporary waiver of intellectual property rights for Covid vaccines.
5080,This is a huge roadblock for developing countries like India to scale up manufacturing their vaccines.
5081,"If it's publicly funded, it should be publicly owned right?"
5082,What am I missing?
5083,[removed]
5084,Fuck it.
5085,I've gone back to licking gas pump handles.
5086,"&gt;clotting AND low platelet count

Exactly, low platelet count that causes bleeding."
5087,Don't edit titles.
5088,And the article makes no mention of the thing that has actually been attributed to AZ and J&amp;J -- the combination of low platelets with the dangerous clots.
5089,Titles like this only add to the confusion and make the job of scientists and responsible authorities harder.
5090,Good to know.
5091,"Omg USPS isn't run by the government😂😂

I feel bad for you that you've been brainwashed to think that government is just inherently bad."
5092,Yes a government can be corrupt and there can be issues with it.
5093,"BUT, government isn't just a bad thing from the start."
5094,If you elect the right people it can be a good thing.
5095,Issue is we've got dumbfucks such as yourself.
5096,"Yeah, better safe than sorry."
5097,"Plus the mutations and variants raging across the globe, it's better to disinfect."
5098,"We do know why they happen, its a big immune response."
5099,In the county I  live in I can't even get in.
5100,To get the vaccine
5101,Then why was I asked to present my health insurance card in Montana?
5102,"Lmao, UK media when [German team](https://www.dw.com/en/astrazeneca-german-team-discovers-thrombosis-trigger/a-56925550) discovered link between blood clots and AZ and even advised against using heparin to treat them back in mid March: ""EU is hating our vaccine"""
5103,Was the /s necessary?
5104,And the family can get vaccinated if they want.
5105,Certainly by next school year.
5106,At some point we must consider it a choice of personal responsibility.
5107,Heck yeah
5108,"But the deaths are kind of plateauing, no?"
5109,It's variants vs. vaccines.
5110,[removed]
5111,You're kinda dumb if you think that's how that would work.
5112,But remain ignorant for all I care.
5113,It has no impact on me
5114,"they are on the waiting list for it, order and turn depends on age and medical history"
5115,Not sure why you are getting downvotes for choosing to do what you feel comfortable with.
5116,You aren't hurting anyone with your decision.
5117,This subreddit is ridiculous sometimes.
5118,"&gt; or how we are tired of Zoom

Since when is anyone freaking tired of Zoom?"
5119,"Geez, the pro-COVID talking points are so tiresome."
5120,2020 taught me that what I really want out of life is *never commuting again*.
5121,I just had my most productive year ever because I didn't waste 10 hours a week sitting in traffic.
5122,I don't think the pandemic would have impact on the protests.
5123,If anything with no pandemic i think they would be bigger.
5124,"Let's not forget that we had mr ""fine people on both sides"" in office."
5125,Yes imagine how much better the economy will be when you have a healthy workforce.
5126,Who arnt avoiding the doctor because theyll go bankrupt.
5127,Their infinite skepticism is simply bizarre to me.
5128,They leave no stones unturned and no doubts sailing the air.
5129,This seems to be entirely motivated by their fear of getting bombarded with complaints about the harrowing symptoms of the vaccine.
5130,"To them inspite of the vaccine preserving our lives by a few more years, the gruesomeness of the symptoms people received from it are too hard to cope with."
5131,I mean I guess it depends on the new rate?
5132,Wouldn't it?
5133,"I probably would have become a full time remote employee, just later than I did."
5134,I work for a contractor on a contract doing I.T for a federal agency.
5135,They started allowing full time telework for us around late march.
5136,Before then working from home was only when there was nasty weather.
5137,Later in the year we learned that our company lost a bid to another company for a long term contract with the agency.
5138,I was able to transition to the new company but it was based out of Tennessee and did not have a physical location in Oklahoma where I live.
5139,So I became a permanent remote employee.
5140,I basically just kept doing what I had been doing since the pandemic started.
5141,Lmao what are you talking about
5142,My understanding is that the J&amp;J and AZ side effects are concerning mainly because they cause a combination of two separate issues: clotting AND low platelet count.
5143,"Please correct me if I'm wrong, but is this study showing that the vaccines have equal chance of ONE of those conditions (the clotting) while not addressing the second condition that complicates things?"
5144,"Seriously, it's been over a year and people still don't get this."
5145,So many are arguing so vociferously that everyone should do the bare minimum and then just accept the pile of dead bodies.
5146,[removed]
5147,Been hearing this for a while.
5148,People who got the Pfizer or Moderna shot get CVT at a rate of 4 per million.
5149,People who got the AZ or J&amp;J shot get CVT at a rate of 5 per million.
5150,People who get COVID get CVT at a rate of 40 per million.
5151,"Meanwhile, the rate of CVT in the general population before either Covid or the vaccines existed was estimated to be between 2 and 5 per million."
5152,"[https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/STROKEAHA.112.671453](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/STROKEAHA.112.671453)

But but but most of the vaccinated people who got CVT were young to middle age women, there must be a link."
5153,"Well, according to the study above, the rate of CVT in women between the ages of 31 and 50 is OVER TWICE that of the general population."
5154,Why are we pausing vaccines again?
5155,As a Brit I think Brexit would have been the biggest topic here as opposed to being somewhat overshadowed by the pandemic.
5156,I don’t really know whether things would be better or worse for the U.K. someone else may have more input.
5157,More like Super Spreader Pro Max 5G Dual Strain
5158,I’ll still be disinfecting surfaces as a precaution and as a new habit.
5159,"Sorry CDC, remember when you said masks were not needed?"
5160,"&gt;Peddlers of industrial bleach who urge Americans to drink the fluid as a “miracle cure” for cancer, HIV/Aids and other diseases have begun touting the product illegally as a treatment for the latest variants of Covid-19."
5161,"The appearance of a new marketing push out of Miami by peddlers of the bleach “cure”, often referred to as “miracle mineral solution”, or MMS, signals the FDA’s uphill struggle in trying to control the potentially lethal trade."
5162,"We are taking significant measures to block or quickly remove items on our marketplace that make false health claims, including listings that promote chlorine dioxide as a cure for Covid.”"
5163,Cambodia's population is only around 17 million.
5164,1000 new cases per day for Cambodia is like 17000 new cases per day for the US.
5165,And Cambodia has nowhere near the infrastructure of the US handle further surge in case count.
5166,"The affected population is also its capital city and its textile industry workers, both are crucial to Cambodia's economic growth."
5167,"Furthermore, before today, Cambodia did not apply lockdown but only curfew rules; meanwhile, 56 people who tested positive in a factory of 2000 workers ran away from quarantine."
5168,"This outbreak is really, really bad when you take Cambodia's population count into account."
5169,"I am hanging out with random kids, actually."
5170,I teach elementary.
5171,"That’s a big part of my concern - they don’t have the choice to get it yet, so I’d like to see masks continue at least in places with a lot of kids for a while."
5172,"Most are low risk, but not all, and I don’t want to get to a point where high risk kids’ families feel stuck between either being at risk or missing education."
5173,US 7-day case average is back over 70k now for the first time since February 17
5174,Yep.
5175,"Well, the ones for humans are."
5176,Pets are still expensive.
5177,"I’d this is true, I guess the recommendation to use other vaccines is not justified."
5178,On the other hand there was 5 cases of VITT in Norway on 130K AZ vaccines and 0 cases so far on more than a million Pfizer vaccines - but this could be due to different groups getting different vaccines.
5179,US went a whole week without 1000 deaths reported a day!
5180,I mean it’s known that doctors and nurses are all sick because they have been wearing masks for so many years.
5181,#sarcasm
5182,There are thousands of workouts on YouTube that you could've done.
5183,You would rather whine about the government than to get your workout in.
5184,"Yeah, the risk is always there."
5185,Brazil is just a big example of it.
5186,"I can't find anything about BC in particular, but I know that business owners in Ontario, Quebec, and Alberta have been arrested for violating COVID-19 restrictions."
5187,"I'm not familiar with Canadian laws, so I'm definitely not the person to ask."
5188,"I imagine that if they've known about it for this long, then the legal system in BC must require some kind of civil court session for this scenario, which is why it hasn't happened yet (courts are backed up worldwide, I doubt it's any different in Canada)."
5189,"Of course I don't know that, it's just my guess"
5190,[removed]
5191,"Canada didn't have those sites, a private company did and they were not ready to produce mRNA vaccines and Canada did fuck all to get them ready for production."
5192,Do you not understand this?
5193,"Do you not understand that countries like the US, UK, etc., invested huge amounts of money to re-tool existing vaccine manufacturing facilities to handle mRNA production?"
5194,Is this part not clear to you?
5195,Do you need diagrams?
5196,That's the first time I hear about that plant.
5197,Is it the Sanofi one?
5198,Are they already producing ingredients or finished vaccines?
5199,Level 2 or 3 surgical masks around here.
5200,Basically a true medical grade version of the blue paper ones.
5201,They should provide them or have a box available for non patient staff.
5202,[removed]
5203,You kind of prove my point.
5204,"Canada has a production site by GSK/Sanofi, whose vaccine ended up being delayed."
5205,"I.e Belgium has a huge manufacturing site by Pfizer, which ended up with the rights to a very successful vaccine."
5206,"Should we now simply flip a coin every pandemic who happens to have the right manufacturer in their country, and then all the big countries (the US) and the few small ones who happened to get lucky (i.e Belgium) get to be smug about it and keep it all for themselves first?"
5207,Should every manufacturer build a production site in like every single country purely to piss nobody off?
5208,"And no, a lack of money is not the issue here."
5209,I.e Biontech straight up said that no money in the world would allow them to magically create more production facilities than they were already building in the time frames that they needed.
5210,[removed]
5211,"&gt;but right now, we're not at a point where we need to chase people down to get their shots."
5212,"In your area, maybe."
5213,Most of my (non-medical-worker) peers (~40) have gotten their shots due to standby lists because so many people aren't showing up for their appointments or the age range that it was being offered to (60-70) simply weren't coming out in the numbers anticipated.
5214,They tell us to bring anyone else we know over 16 with us.
5215,True it will probably be smoother when everyone is allowed.
5216,My grandparents were vaccinated last week at the vaccination center in Sneek (Friesland).
5217,"The people working there told them that they had the capacity of 1400 vaccination per day, but are currently only doing 400 vaccinations per day."
5218,"My employer, a hospital, emailed everyone and said it was optional."
5219,They also said if we don't get it and get sick we can't use out PTO bank B.
5220,"Which is a second PTO bank that we can only use if we get a surgery, pregnant, or the flu."
5221,"It's a bullshit bank that you can't access, and when you do they use a week of bank A, before you can use B."
5222,Bank A is the one we can access for days off.
5223,We also don't get paid any of bank B when we quit or retire.
5224,Why the staff put up with this bullshit is beyond me.
5225,Luckily I can at least say I got the vaccine in December.
5226,Every other teacher I know.
5227,Haven’t heard a single one having trouble with kids wearing masks.

5231,&gt;Once the pandemic is over the vaccine passports will not be used anymore.
5232,RemindMe!
5233,"2 years

Or should be longer?"
5234,What do you think?
5235,If you care more about other people then you don't have the vaccine yet.
5236,There is no surplus supply.
5237,There's no sugarcoating it.
5238,If you've been vaccinated you took a spot from someone else.
5239,What about the data for specific age ranges?
5240,I don't think the headline incidence figure was never much of a problem.
5241,Like you making up a story to support an idiotic agenda?
5242,I haven't been to a theatre since the weekend Onward was released.
5243,Once my last round of vaccinations is done  Kong VS Godzilla is hopefully going to be my first theatrical film in over a year and I'm literally counting the days.
5244,We already have vaccine passports.
5245,Kids cant go to school unless they have thier regular vaccines.
5246,Why should covid vaccines be any different?
5247,"After all, we are talking about people dying, not just if they can eat in a restaurant or whatever."
5248,If they used even scientific evidence of that to prioritize men over women this country would have been burned to the ground by now.
5249,Even though we used the same statistics to prioritize non-whites over whites.
5250,I also thought most Americans did not want universal healthcare but it is not true anymore : [https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/09/29/increasing-share-of-americans-favor-a-single-government-program-to-provide-health-care-coverage/](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/09/29/increasing-share-of-americans-favor-a-single-government-program-to-provide-health-care-coverage/)
5251,I would go with the dumb option.
5252,Ivermectin.
5253,And they should be.
5254,Why?
5255,"Because those people (mostly, I’m generalizing) say why take a vaccine (preventative measure) when we have ivermectin that we have to take at 10+ times the normal dose?"
5256,Could ivermectin work?
5257,"Of course, but just like the vaccines have, they need to run be through safety and efficacy trials"
5258,I have no idea how it works in Canada.
5259,"I imagine that it needs to be brought to court, which is why it hasn't happened yet, since courts are so backed up."
5260,"I don't know that though, because I'm not familiar with Canadian business laws."
5261,&gt;The virus wont magically disappear the day you hit 75%.
5262,The virus will never magically disappear.
5263,We will never get to 100% vaccination rate and no vaccine is 100% effective.
5264,"The goal is not, never has been, and never will be to get to 0 cases or 0 deaths before we can reopen."
5265,Why can't they arrest the owners first?
5266,Anyone get extreme foot cramps/charley horses with the moderna vaccine?
5267,Just got my 2nd dose today.
5268,"Haven’t had a cramp in years but tonight I’m tossing and turning, they’re so painful"
5269,[removed]
5270,Evidence based science sadly takes time and.... evidence.
5271,Rarely will researchers jump on something with small amounts of data.
5272,Damn.
5273,Gonna be wearing these masks for a long time...
5274,What I don’t get is why in the mean time if you observe that they are operating a business without a business licence you would not just put police seal on the building as it is clearly in violation of operating without a licence.
5275,"If they found a bar here that was selling alcohol without a licence I’m sure it would be closed temporarily until they get their stuff in order, at least on the second visit."
5276,How can they just leave it be in the mean time is what I don’t understand.
5277,Nope
5278,Kind of.
5279,"But after the pandemic AZ can make a profit, although I think they are obliged to produce at cost for poorer countries and with the EU and US deciding not being interested in the AZ vaccine in the future that might stay the same."
5280,"However, an argument could be made that it should not only be non-profit but open license."
5281,That is to say that anyone should be able to manufacture it (provided they have a licensed facility).
5282,"I mean, it ain't free, we just already paid for them"
5283,"Maybe, but then every time someone posts a TIL about public libraries being free there are always a shocking number of people that turn up saying they're also just now learning that.. and the public library system has always been free."
5284,&gt;Kids under 12 aren't even on the vaccination radar yet.
5285,"Actually, multiple studies are already underway on the vaccine for kids under 12."
5286,And the hospitalization and death stats for the demographic are extremely low.
5287,"&gt;Also there's too many unknowns with variants 

Good thing that (if you read the actual studies instead of the clickbait headlines), all of the current vaccines are still very effective against all of the known variants."
5288,"The article states 40% of the 5,800 cases were over 60 years old."
5289,It's a bit less permanent than the article suggests.
5290,If the situation changes it can still be reversed.
5291,"Such changes could include missing delivery of alternatives, and increased number of infections."
5292,"This decision is basically ""so long as there are few cases, and we get alternative vaccine, we won't use it."""
5293,They live in a country where healthcare is basically a scam an any interaction with it runs the risk of financial ruin.
5294,They probably just tune out any talk of medical anything as not for them.
5295,"Let us not talk about the implication this would have on ticket price, pollution..."
5296,This is a false solution to what isn't a problem.
5297,"At this point unless there is a real reason for physical presence of a very specific person somewhere further than can be driven to, there is no reason to take a fucking plane."
5298,I don't know how enforcing this would work but I am sure as shit that it would leave more than middle sits empty and reduce risks even further.

5301,Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) if you have any questions or concerns.
5302,*
5303,Shot #1 can be rough too if you've had covid and already have antibodies.
5304,I mostly dealt with fever/fatigue/headache/sore arm and I was pretty miserable but thankfully it only lasted a couple of days.
5305,"Not looking forward to doing it again for my second dose in a couple of weeks, but it's still better than having covid."
5306,Why is vaccinating against a rapidly mutating virus a choice?
5307,I'm not allowed to walk around with a frag granade in a public place
5308,Oh I envy you so much.
5309,Not sure when we get there in Czechia.
5310,A few μg of mRNA more or less isn't relevant for the effort that goes into production.
5311,"Ultimately you have to put your mRNA into stable, handable units and the most effort goes into creating these units, in this case sterile multi-dose vials."
5312,Por que no los dos?
5313,"My GF's mom is in this number, thanks to a scare of family members catching Covid and her realizing how easy it would have been for her to catch it."
5314,"She wanted to only get one shot, and we kept telling her go get the pfizer or moderna, to no avail."
5315,"Well, after her scare she went and got the pfizer shot."
5316,Lord Modimort
5317,How about the statistics for how many Americans are working too many hours and can't take the time off of work to get one?
5318,Or who have 3 weeks of travel back to back?
5319,Yeah I'm not planning on getting one until towards the end of May hopefully...At least it'll be like a video game release...the vaccines will have a patch or two on 'em by then?
5320,Lol jk
5321,could be that you pride yourself in that.
5322,"if so, good for you."
5323,But doctors as a whole have a much higher than average rate of NPD than the general public.
5324,So it isn't like medical professionals are any less selfish.
5325,"I and pretty much everyone out there appreciate your job as much as any other high risk and necessary job, like construction, police, electricians, plumbing, etc."
5326,Still doesn't mean I am willing to risk or sacrifice myself for some slobs I'll never meet.
5327,[removed]
5328,Not all women are on birth control...
5329,Which is why getting vaccinated by an mRNA vaccine in a couple of months is a great idea.
5330,The difference in efficacy against variants compared to the AZ vaccine is higher than the ~2% additional risk while waiting for the better option.
5331,"You don't know whether or not my maths (it's mathematics, with an S on the end; it's plural) check out because you don't know which demographics I fit into, nor how old I am."
5332,Once again: I will take my chances.
5333,“I’m not going to spend my prime years being worried about this.”   I think leading climate scientists and epidemiologists have a different take on this based on their scientific studies.
5334,Nobody should be apologizing for the inconvenience considering the whole world was warned many times.

5342,*
5343,The biggest issue IMO is that the JJ vaccine is the one that most of the world needs.
5344,"So just minimizing risk by using an alternative works great in the West, but in places were perfect cold chain and storage is an issue there is no ""if you're at risk or scared, use the mRNA vaccines"" since you just can't get them to say rural Ethiopia, or in the Amazon."
5345,"Pfizer has a booster in the works too:

[https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/25/is-more-simply-better-why-pfizer-thinks-a-booster-of-its-covid-vaccine-might-work-against-new-variants/](https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/25/is-more-simply-better-why-pfizer-thinks-a-booster-of-its-covid-vaccine-might-work-against-new-variants/)

It doesn't sound like either booster is targeting the Africa or Brazil variants directly, which sound like the greatest threat."
5346,This is one of the most helpful things I have seen on AZ and maybe the thing on Reddit that will most impact my life.
5347,I am likely to be eligible for AZ soon and in a low to medium risk area (4 per 10k but rising).
5348,I am going to sign up rather than wait two months for Pfizer or Moderna.
5349,Thanks.
5350,"Either way, the incidence of either happening is incredibly small, I don't get why the population at large is putting so much weight into this."
5351,"I get why the science community and doctors/scientists are discussing this, but your chances of getting having a stroke due to having had COVID is so incredibly small to begin with."
5352,"Some of the articles and people on this sub make you believe that if you had COVID, it's a matter of time until something catastrophic happens."
5353,Everyone I know bar my 98 year old great grandmother had COVID and got rid of COVID without issue.
5354,Agreed.
5355,It’s complicated.
5356,"Like you said, the chance of getting covid is at play here."
5357,"The 1/10 number is after a years time, and shouldn’t be used to compare your chances today while you wait."
5358,The latest numbers I saw was 70k more confirmed cases out of 230m people.
5359,So the current rate is 0.03% of the total population was infected.
5360,"But since 30M already have been infected, it’s 0.035% of possible people (assuming no reinfections)."
5361,But then there are people who are vaccinated.
5362,Do we remove the 123M that have had one shot (0.09% rate)?
5363,Or the 69M that have gotten both (0.053% rate)?
5364,"And like you pointed out, you can reduce your chances of being infected by social distancing, masking, etc."
5365,and the infected rate number should go down as people are vaccinated.
5366,"But there is the issue where if everyone is now delayed 30 days to get a vaccine due to the reduced supply, it means more infections not just for those people, but additional infections as it spreads."
5367,"Personally, I think the real question should be looked at at a country or world view."
5368,We need a few data points.
5369,"One is if we have AZ / JJ vaccines, how many people get covid now till herd immunity."
5370,"Second is if we pull AZ / JJ, how many people get covid now till herd immunity."
5371,"And finally, if we keep AZ / JJ, how many people get blood clots."
5372,But I get the ethical debate of known healthy person with a potential blood clot bs unknown deadly virus
5373,"""Some places"" isn't good enough, it has to be every place."
5374,It is 100% different.
5375,Incivility isn't allowed by the automod but bizarre covid conspiracies are?
5376,I'm out.
5377,Fuck this sub.
5378,I don't want it at all.
5379,"With 10% of the population having been confirmed sick with COVID, this is such a moot point."
5380,It's basically net zero anyway.
5381,If nobody takes the vaccine your likelihood of getting infected would be higher.
5382,This will age beautifully.
5383,I've had surgery 4 times.
5384,I believe the risk of dying during anesthesia is several times higher than the risk of blood clots from AstraZeneca
5385,I'm not sure how people still trust Pfizer after the statement they made about their endemic profit model and yearly boosters
5386,"It should be of deep concern that the experts who are parsing all the data coming in have decided to pause the JNJ jabs, and in many cases the AZ."
5387,I have trouble believing it's just a small number of blood clots they're hearing about and trying to get to the bottom of.
5388,"""Watch what they do, not what they say."""
5389,And what they're doing seems to be trying to get a handle on a much bigger problem.
5390,"Yeah, nah, I’m good, thanks."
5391,There is *always* going to be the possibility of some scary variant (or - get this - completely different virus!)
5392,lurking around the corner.
5393,"Always has, always will be."
5394,Get used to it.
5395,"If you want to live the rest of your life worrying about every worst-case scenario, good luck with that."

5397,I mean I know it's bad there but haven't they been saying this for a few weeks now?
5398,There are places where government IDs are free for low income and easily accessible (often by mail) and it still limits access to require the ID.
5399,This isn't different.
5400,Definitely agree that at a certain point we don’t need to worry about people who are choosing not to get the shot.
5401,That’s their choice and it will be up to them to manage that risk they have chosen to accept by not getting vaccinated.
5402,We just aren’t there yet.
5403,how long has this study been done?
5404,It was not meant as an evil comment..
5405,"I do understand why the benefits outrank the issue here, but still, it will be really useful data for the world."
5406,"Hey, Dwight."
5407,This is literally the intent of all vaccines.
5408,If everyone who get vaccinated gets it then herd immunity actually starts working as intended at whatever percentage of population for the specific virus.
5409,Covid just happens to need a high percentage of vaccinations in order to jump start hwrd immunity
5410,I think the idea may be that some people will use this an argument against vaccines so the article is maybe getting ahead of that.
5411,"Herd immunity will not ""kill off the virus completely""."
5412,Herd immunity will just slow the spread.
5413,"Its quite difficult to prove a negative,[ but heres a PBS article on covid herd immunity ](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/how-will-we-know-weve-reached-herd-immunity-for-covid-19)

&gt;The goal is to get to “herd immunity,” which is when enough people have immunity, either from vaccination or a past infection, to stop uncontrolled spread."
5414,"&gt;Herd immunity doesn’t make any one person immune, and outbreaks can still flare up."
5415,"It means that a virus is no longer easily jumping from person to person, helping to protect those who are still vulnerable to catching it."
5416,Herd immunity will not kill off the virus completely.
5417,That's just flat out wrong.
5418,"It will reduce the speed at which it spreads, and therefore reduce the number of cases."
5419,The virus will still be around though.
5420,&gt; Had this been the case then the mRNA vaccines wouldn't have been developed at all.
5421,No country would be willing to invest in vaccine production infrastructure if the reward was getting a spot in line according to your population.
5422,How would you get to that conclusion?
5423,"Especially since Pfizer/Biontech did not even take any upfront money for development of the vaccine or infrastructure, except 500 Million € from the EU and Germany, that as far as i know, had no sort of exclusivity attached."
5424,"The reason Pfizer does not export from the US is not that they got an especially sweet deal, its that there is an executive order that orders for all Americans to be vaccinated first before there can be exports."
5425,Its also why there are 10s of millions of AZ doses sitting in the US even though its not even approved there.
5426,"&gt; But I'm struggling to understand why citizens of a ""smaller"" country like Canada, which has chosen not to invest in its own production capacity or work with manufacturers to set some up, deserves ""equal access"" to something another country spent billions to produce."
5427,My whole point is that it is simply not feasible for every nation of 10 million + people to have production sites for every single kind of vaccine.
5428,Would Belgium be especially smart for having a giant Pfizer mRNA production site in their country and simply banning export before all Belgians are vaccinated?
5429,Is Canada dumb for having a Sanofi/GSK site instead?
5430,"If Sanofi/GSK would be the big winner of the vaccine race, should Canada ban exports to any other nation and pad itself on the shoulder for its superior vaccine investment strategy over those Belgian mRNA idiots?"
5431,&gt; Canada has the money and they could've done what Israel did but they chose not to.
5432,Think this through.
5433,Everyone has this brilliant idea to simply pay what Israel did.
5434,Everyone simply pays more.
5435,"Instead of 50 billion profit, Pfizer now makes 100 Billion."
5436,Do you think that leads to any noticeable improvement in vaccine supply?
5437,All the vaccine manufacturing in the world is maxed.
5438,There is little you can do to improve supply in complicated supply chains over such short time frames.
5439,"Just look at the giant mess the chip industry is in right now, which has very similar issues."
5440,There simply is not enough capacity and building capacity takes time.
5441,I certainly agree that the vaccine vs the virus is a pretty clear equation at this point.
5442,Because usually Americans get gouged with anything related to healthcare.
5443,"What we’re doing with the vaccine rollout IS absolutely incredible, but when we’re used to paying out the ass for healthcare costs, the fact that it’s free is somewhat surprising."
5444,"Before vaccination hospitals were prioritizing beds, so proportionally most hospitalizations were among those with severe symptoms."
5445,"With reduced pressure on the healthcare system, doctors may have been comfortable admitting people with moderate symptoms for treatment and observation."
5446,In that context patients benefit from a reduction of symptoms due to vaccination as well as early intervention.
5447,Severity in fully vaccinated people is probably going to be difficult to pinpoint.
5448,"Israel started vaccination with highest risk populations, so they initially would have represented more of the fully vaccinated population."
5449,Adding variants of concern could also complicate the discussion.
5450,"Since it has been women only so far, I think they have to look at the factor of birth control."
5451,I've always read that birth control can increase risk for blood clots.
5452,I take a low dose aspirin to be on the safe side anyways.
5453,That doesn't take into account that numbers fluctuate.
5454,"I got Moderna so I don't know how long it is before you're fully immune with AstraZeneca, but you can get it now while numbers are pretty low (I'm only talking about my area) or wait until they start going up, make an appointment, wait for that and then wait for the vaccine to kick in."
5455,"The cases went from around 20 a day to 300 a day almost overnight in my area, that adds a ton of risk."
5456,Plummeted isn't better than zero.
5457,Well said.
5458,Yea alright dude.
5459,This is coming from the guy who said don’t change the subject even though you were the one who brought up the government first.
5460,"Again just because you don’t like it, doesn’t make it any less true."
5461,Brush up on actual facts and not just emotions to guide you through life.
5462,"Dude, with the talk of variants, people are clueless with the risk of COVID19 related to age."
5463,People think young people are just as at risk as older people where I am (Canada) because the media and doctors are making it out this way.
5464,It's leading to a call - even from medical professionals - to vaccinate essential workers in their 20s instead of the general population in their 50s.
5465,"It's really bad, and unfortunate."
5466,I don't think that's going to be the end of the story.
5467,The blood clot scare will be forgotten and the millions or billions of people in poor countries who will get this vaccine will be grateful for it.
5468,And the rich countries will be grateful that covid will be wiped out instead left to simmer in the slums of the world to mutate to variants that are resistant to the more expensive vaccines.
5469,Not sure why you are getting downvoted.
5470,This is a major factor.
5471,Birth control does increase your risk of blood clotting.
5472,Women are also at a higher risk of developing blood clots than men in general.
5473,These are both well researched and understood things in medicine.
5474,I’m sure it plays a role in this situation.
5475,[removed]
5476,"And yet, despite people thinking healthcare is unaffordable and mind bogglingly complicated to navigate between all the jargon and insurance co-pays and usual and customary rates and deductibles and shit.... people still get mad when we talk about going to a single-payer system to reduce costs and make administration and use simple and easy to understand

5483,"Don't test, don't tell was super effective."
5484,I'm kind of surprised.
5485,I figured all the world leaders were fully vaccinated by now.
5486,Hasn't it already been confirmed by medical professionals and scientists that covid will most likely stick around like a flu?
5487,"Gender is a social construct, it doesn’t matter"

5491,Hugo de Jonge please take notes
5492,"I mean, yeah.. masks aren't 100 percent protection."
5493,We've known this for over a year
5494,I get this totally - I was scared to get my second Pfizer but ended up with just a very sore arm.
5495,Stay very hydrated and try not to let the horror stories get to you.
5496,That is great to hear.
5497,"In my country we don't have mRNAs around, only Astra and the chinese one."
5498,"Not sure if they apply to the same percentage, but it would be nice."
5499,"&gt; The last timely shipment of the Moderna vaccine arrived in Canada on March 11, according information provided to The Globe and Mail by the Public Health Agency of Canada."
5500,"Since then, shipments of hundreds of thousands of shots have arrived later than expected, and that trend will continue in the weeks ahead, PHAC said."
5501,I think this part is what's important from the article.
5502,"A lot of Moderna's shipments have arrived late and in multiple batches, apparently due to quality control issues."
5503,Hopefully things can start to smooth out once the US is finished with their campaign and we can get the doses from them instead of having to fly them in from Switzerland/Spain.
5504,i read somewhere that insured may still get hit with a copay charge.
5505,"&gt;When the state that is the most populous in the union with 10 million more people has less *deaths per capita* than one state with 10 million less people that’s how you know Texas has a shit government

You should seriously evaluate your critical thinking skills dude."
5506,UK is doing set of trials using alternating doses of different vaccines.
5507,"1 pfizer, then one AZ &amp; vice versa."
5508,They are expanding it to included J&amp;J and Novavax.
5509,They will be using the currently approved original Moderna.
5510,Hopefully this will help give an idea of vaccine compatability on top of finding out if using different vaccines give might give even better immune response.
5511,The last I read pfizer was planning on testing a 3rd dose of their original covid19 vaccine to see if it improves response to variants and are considering making a different vaccine specific to variant(s).
5512,Novavax is already working on a variant specific vaccine.
5513,if i remember correctly they are consdiering trial with it in the same shot with their original vaccine as well as a solo booster.
5514,"Of course it is *possible*, but we have no evidence to suggest that is currently going to happen."

5518,"No, take a look at Israel - their cases have plummeted."

5520,Vaccines are.
5521,"Fact of the matter is, a big proportion of the population is terrible at risk management."
5522,"They don't understand the magnitude of probability, so if a lot of people are doing assessments they're doing so erronously."
5523,Yeah we're going to need a source for that claim.
5524,"All the data from the clinical trials shows 66% efficacy for symptomatic Covid after J&amp;J, closer to 80% in the US, and 100% efficacy for hospitalizations and death."
5525,"There are confidence intervals around all of those numbers but nothing I've seen has shown it to be ""below 70% effective at preventing severe Covid and hospitalizations."""
5526,"Well,  that statement is a flat out slap in the face to medical professionals."
5527,"Yes, the public as a whole is very selfish, but I pride myself in seeing to it that they are saved from their own ignorance."
5528,“Won’t someone please think of the children!” - Helen Lovejoy
5529,Hence why I took the first jab.
5530,I see it as the lesser evil compared to covid.
5531,"The brain fog, forgetfulness, struggle to think behaviours terrify me."
5532,The risk being worth it or not can be calculated.
5533,Calculate the risk of you getting it multiplied by the risk of you developing serious complications or death then compare against the risk of the vaccine.
5534,That's why some countries are starting to recommend older people to continue getting the vaccines since their risks from covid is higher while young people are told to wait because their risks are lower.
5535,Unfortunately people will read this headline and think that this exonerates AZ.
5536,"The choice isn't between Covid and AZ, but between AZ and other vaccines."
5537,It's not like I'm gonna purposely inject myself with the virus.
5538,"Despite massive mistakes done by countries like US, Canada or Europe generally, they're not even close to what happened and is happening in Brazil."

5544,I'm fucked up with anxiety.
5545,"I didn't get covid until now, and I do whatever I can to stay home as much as possible, avoid seeing other people and so on."
5546,"Still, I fear I could get covid with the new variant here."
5547,"The new variant is filling hospitals with young people from 20 to 40yo, putting them into ICU and some of them dying, even without any comorbidities."
5548,"It's fucked up to think about, to hear about it..."
5549,"The hospitals are full, the medications are lacking."
5550,The vaccines exist but are not going as fast as we hoped for.
5551,"My only choice is to keep protecting myself as hard as I can and hoping I will persist untouched by Covid until I get vaccinated, so I can at least ease my fears of dying of it."

5553,April 30th is their last day of blocking middle seats.
5554,They are succeeding in preventing deaths.. the rest is yet to be seen.
5555,The countries that have reduced the risk to zero are not ever going to take an unnecessary risk given the economy is back to almost full employment and their population can act as normal right now.
5556,There is nothing to be gained.
5557,All data coming in seemingly confirms the findings in the clinical trial
5558,"I thought after 2 weeks, one dose provides 80% protection?"
5559,It's just natural.
5560,"Humans are often workshy and seek distraction, especially in postmodern times."
5561,Are there even percentages?
5562,In J&amp;J it is about 6 cases no?
5563,"Then if there are roughly 6x fewer young men vaccinated, we have nothing to go off of."
5564,Similarly in EU there is no vaccine for young people and UK is fairly small in terms of population.
5565,"It would be great to see if there is anything, but it is entirely possible not enough young people have been vaccinated."
5566,"Sorry, corrected, sometimes my english fails me and the autocorrect was unhelpful."
5567,"Preventing hospitalization is not really the criteria to ""kill off the virus completely""."
5568,As long as theres variants that survive in someone's system theres a chance for them to mutate into something more deadly over time.
5569,"My city requires masks outdoors and maybe 20-25% of people do it, to be fair we have a large amount of tourists here who don't care."
5570,Only eight times?
5571,"That's worrying because that sorta implies that the AZ vaccine isn't safe, due to the fact that the rate of covid causing these clots was extremely high and dangerous."
5572,1/8th of really fucking bad is still pretty fucking bad.
5573,Or more likely a combination of both.
5574,Bullshit talking point.
5575,"The Canadian system and quite as lot of other universal health systems are much less expensive (in tax dollars per capita, that is even *before* you factor in private spending) and produce better results than the US system by just about every metric."

5577,"Sure, you can SEARCH for information on anything, but there is not a single mention of blood clots here https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/coronavirus-disease-covid-19.html"
5578,I would totally ignore this study.
5579,There is a strong conflict of interest.
5580,We know the AZ (coproduced with Oxford University) is troubled and Oxford University conducting this study is pure bias.
5581,"The point is that not everyone will be immunised or have caught it developed immunity, so there will always be some floating around, like the flu, and it’ll come back every year, like the flu, as it’s so easily transmitted, like the flu."
5582,It’s not like small pox that can be cornered and driven off by a vaccine.
5583,Is this a big deal?
5584,Anglo media/nation/interests not admitting they got not a very good vaccine and pushing to use it no matter what.
5585,Why J&amp;J vaccine was stopped and not AZ?
5586,Is it because US has more than 1 vaccine developed?
5587,Your argument would make more sense of the only complication of covid was a potential brain clot.
5588,"You are saying weigh the risks of brain clot from vaccine vs. one from infection when really, since these clots and anaphylactic reactions seem to be the only major risks of the vaccine we should be weighing those risks vs the risk of getting covid, which include: hospitalization, permanent lung damage, brain damage, cardiac injury, pulmonary embolism, stroke, death, etc..."

5627,Somehow things CAN get worse for Sweden
5628,My job... posted information about a single location we could get it at.
5629,That’s something right?
5630,"Well with what you’re suggesting, it kind of does lol"
5631,Both my wife and I are vaccinated and we have a 9 month old daughter.
5632,"I know the mortality stats - I’m not worrying about her getting Covid and dying; I’m worried that she gets it, recovers, and then a year later develops asthma which limits her breathing ability for the rest of her life."
5633,I would 100% enroll her in a vaccine program that’s extending the age group of a vaccine already tested on millions.
5634,"&gt;you are far more likely to die going for groceries in your car, driving as safe as you possibly can, than die from a blood clot from one of these vaccines."
5635,In the advanced countries you do groceries walking.
5636,The store is close to your house.
5637,You would run this risk anyway.
5638,Taking this specific vaccine is a choice.
5639,Is the Russian vaccine as dangerous?
5640,Because in Argentina they use the Sputnik and I haven't heard of deaths.

5648,"Even by the danish head of the health board own words, it's 1 in 40k, cut women out of it, and it's probably lower, let's say 1 in 60k if half of all danes got az, less than 40 people would suffer serious consequences."

5665,&gt; I guess you’re not the owner of a gym that reopened despite lockdown orders that closed all the gyms.
5666,"Not much of a stretch to imagine a huge number of his customers — healthy young males in their 20s to 30s — dying of COVID, particularly in light of the fact that the gym owner is a Trump sucker who thinks masking is a liberal lie."
5667,"Gyms opening up during lockdown was stupid, but physically fit 20 and 30-year olds are not dying *en masse* from COVID."
5668,People like you who overblow the whole situation are why others refuse to take it seriously.
5669,I believe the UD also put J&amp;J on hold and never approved AZ.
5670,They're daily death rate is still 2 times higher per capita tha NL.
5671,"They'll  get to 50/60% vaccinated before NL,  but I expect they will struggle more with getting reluctant people on board."
5672,It will be interesting to see what happens in the fall with cases and deaths between different country that achieve different vaccination acceptance rates.
5673,"Oh, man."
5674,"I'm not trying to argue, homie."
5675,I'm also not going to apologize for asking questions.
5676,"I'm genuinely curious as to why its relevant, because I care."
5677,I can't know how things work in other places without asking questions.
5678,That's why I asked.
5679,"I wasn't condescending, or acting superior."
5680,Just asking.
5681,"People will get offended by anything, and everything, and that was not my intention."
5682,People from other countries use this website.
5683,I'm also sticking by what I said.
5684,I'm glad we didn't have the AZ rolled out here.
5685,"We have a lot of anti-vaxx fools, and having 2 vaccines pulled at the same time would make life much harder."
5686,People are bad enough as it is here.
5687,"We've had a lot of people die, and get sick."
5688,It's wrecked my finances.
5689,"I'm not taking pleasure in anyone else's problems, just commenting."
5690,"I mean, if folks are that jealous of the USA on vaxx availability, and roll out, it's completely ignorant of our governments totally botched response and our death toll."
5691,"I'm sure there are a lot of folks saying, ""I'm glad I wasn't in the USA."""
5692,"And, I would agree with them on that."
5693,"Oops, I thought they were responding to HopefulAnybody’s comment (below yours) about this."
5694,My bad...
5695,Quite high as general guidance is to test 3 days after or more
5696,Idk my guess is the IT system was thrown together quickly or the desk forgot to get your info while you were there
5697,So ~3%?
5698,Who cares
5699,"i think you should probably take a close look at the vaccination numbers in these next few weeks and determine for yourself how many people were actually not vaccinated... 

here's a hint... we would not have had 30 more million vaccinated just because we have 30 million doses of oxford sitting in some warehouse..."
5700,"Pfizer CEO allowed it by saying no matter how much it costs, I want a vaccine asap."
5701,And they made many extremely difficult decisions - it was all or nothing.Watch Mission Possible: The Race for a Vaccine on YouTube.

5708,"If my government decides to make vaccines mandatory, I will effectively throw myself off a cliff before any virus or vaccine kills me 🤣🤣"
5709,I mean it's already a wasteland...
5710,I'm also Australian but don't share your conviction that were past lockdowns.
5711,I think there's a fairly high chance of more lockdowns if our hotel quarantine program continues to have major weaknesses.
5712,Especially headed into winter with most virus cases now arriving being more virulent than the strain that caused the Melbourne outbreak.
5713,There's still the potential for disaster in Australia unfortunately.
5714,The past is not really behind them- there is still the scandal around the comfort women and no way in hell has China forgotten what that happened to them.
5715,"&gt; There eventually has to come a time where the economic and mental health toll isn't worth the lives being ""saved""."

5717,"Until then, there's no question which gets priority."

5720,"I'm guilty of just reading headlines a lot but I read a lot of the double-masking articles because I was skeptical it was necessary and the messaging was often ""double-masking can help you get better filtration and a tight seal on your face."""
5721,"Which is great and all, but if you flip that around it's basically ""if you have a tight seal and good filtration, one mask is good""

So yeah, I feel like a lot of people shrugged hearing that and just kept on like they were."

5734,"&gt; official numbers

there[ was a study](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X\(20\)30544-1/fulltext) indicating that official numbers were under counting cases by a factor of 30."
5735,J&amp;J will get the job done even if it isn't as good as Pfizer or Moderna.
5736,I'm sure there'll be a booster specifically designed for the variants out some time in August or September.
5737,Until the  you should be fine.
5738,"To be fair, we all just expect to go bankrupt from a routine checkup, let alone a vaccine."
5739,Well it’s Canada so...
5740,Is there any clinical trial where they intentionally infect the subjects with a deadly pathogen?
5741,I think we all know that the answer is no.
5742,I can imagine the lawsuits if one of the employees (or their family) gets really sick.
5743,But they didn't take a number.
5744,They only know the insurance company but not my member Id etc.

5746,"So....not banning the people likely to spread/die....but those who now are safer and lower risk are banned.....

American logic right there."
5747,Allll depending on your county or state.
5748,"I was temping for a large company over the holidays, paying flexible spending and health savings accounts amongst other things, and I absolutely got bills especially from Florida, especially from a certain large employer there, and I absolutely had to pay people back for their covid tests, that they did, indeed get billed for."
5749,150.00 the usual cost.
5750,"Hi, any opinions on whether I should get my 2nd dose of the Moderna covid vaccine in the same arm or the opposite as the first?"
5751,Thank you!
5752,Your husband is a great boss.
5753,That and closer investigation.
5754,They were being closely followed and tested.
5755,Sub clinical and mild infections are probably more common than the 5800 but that never gets recorded.
5756,Just further proof the vaccine is doing its job
5757,I'm high risk though getting a bad draw in the genetic lottery and I've been super careful this whole time.
5758,I'm not in a rush to head back to normal life while there still are plenty of unknowns out there.
5759,"Lots of other people feel otherwise and that's fine, I hope they have a good time."
5760,Right now I'm happy making food and eating with friends in my backyard.
5761,May or June once we start running out of people who want to be vaccinated we'll play immunization Santa Claus and drop pallets of vaccines into the stockings of good little allies and friendly nations.
5762,"Ho ho ho, Merry Vaxmas."
5763,I mean I saw that without a vaccine.
5764,I don't think anyone was within 15 ft of my friend and I.
5765,"At least in Germany, the government already said that the current, somewhat tighter lockdown measures will extend until late May or early June."
5766,Realistically this means we’ll have them we’ll into the fall.
5767,The lockdown that started in November?
5768,The one that we’ve been in for six months while the government did absolutely nothing to improve the situation?
5769,That was supposed to be two weeks to save Christmas.
5770,"We’re still vaccinating people at a snails pace and, with the J&amp;J vaccine probably not going to be used under 60’s, I’m really not hopeful about the “end of September” time line."
5771,"yes, but you go on to question why this study is relevant."
5772,it is relevant to many other places that may not have the resources to give out optimal vaccine dosing.
5773,For now Canada is pretty much only vaccinating people 60+ or people that work in the healthcare industry but it varies between provinces.
5774,early stages?
5775,i've had my niclosamide at the ready since september 2020. it needs to be combined with something like bromhexine to more completely inhibit viral entry.
5776,the knowledge has been out there for a long time.
5777,i hope future investigations can reveal the massive failure of the way evidence based medicine is practiced in preventing the unnecessary deaths of so many people.
5778,"last thing, niclosamide has poor bioavailability so it needs to be crushed into powder form to aid absorption."
5779,I just thought the US crazies were the loudest.
5780,I guess the lesson is if you stop acknowledging the pandemic and ban public health measures it will just go away.
5781,Yeah that's clear
5782,Middle seat gets both armrests.
5783,It’s the only perk of the middle seat.
5784,Pretty sure they said $100 AND two paid days off.
5785,Not $100 to cover two unpaid days.
5786,"This is probably a stupid question and the answer is probably obvious but I'm just curious if it weren't for the excellent rollout of vaccines in the US, how bad would the situation be here right now?"
5787,"I know we have new leadership so maybe things would be a bit better, but looking at the individual states that are mostly or fully open, it is up to the state government and something that the federal government and Biden's administration can't really do anything about."
5788,Would we be looking at a surge much worse than November and December?
5789,Would we be worse than Brazil and India?
5790,"No no, this is on y'all this time."
5791,Don't drag us into your horse shit just because you can't admit that Canada has asshats too.
5792,Exactly.
5793,I never had a issue with a two\three week shutdown if hospitals are overwhelmed.
5794,Other than that the other costs will be worst.
5795,Well they moved on from imperialistic war crimes well enough
5796,And I think people are already at a greater risk from COVID.
5797,The problem is most people have to go to a clinic and you still have to pay copays if you have insurance or the whole visit if you don’t.
5798,This is like your new girlfriend bringing up your ex girlfriend every time you fight.
5799,"I wasn't gloating, or shitting on anyone."
5800,I'm thankful for what we wound up with.
5801,"Healthcare in my country is generally shitty, unless you're rich."
5802,I'm not rich.
5803,"So, yeah, I'm fortunate, and grateful we had access to the Pfizer."
5804,I don't see anything wrong with stating that...in a single sentence.
5805,"Apparently, that's a major trigger for folks."
5806,So it's only a riskier proposition for the low-risk under 30s.
5807,Why aren't we just age restricting it while they do their risk assessment?
5808,Gettin paid for pain
5809,All adults will be eligible by May 1st and the risk to kid is astronomically low.
5810,It was never 100%.
5811,"it IS very good, but it was never 100%."
5812,That bogus number came from the trials that were mostly done with younger people who were not going to die in the first place.
5813,Some of them had zero PLACEBO COVID deaths!
5814,Would you therefore conclude that the PLACEBO prevents 100% of deaths?
5815,"[https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/03/pfizer-moderna-and-johnson-johnson-vaccines-compared/618226/](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/03/pfizer-moderna-and-johnson-johnson-vaccines-compared/618226/)

 

The two vaccine trials that did explicitly report hospitalizations as an efficacy outcome make this latter issue very clear."
5816,"For the [AstraZeneca](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/assessment-report/covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca-epar-public-assessment-report_en.pdf) vaccine, one person in the control group had severe COVID-19, but eight people were hospitalized; for [Johnson &amp; Johnson](https://www.fda.gov/media/146217/download), 34 people in the placebo group had severe COVID-19, but only five people were hospitalized."
5817,It’s true that zero vaccinated people were hospitalized in either study after the vaccines took effect.
5818,"But with numbers that small, you can’t draw a reliable conclusion about how high efficacy may be for these outcomes."
5819,"As Diana Zuckerman of the National Center for Health Research [pointed out](https://www.center4research.org/testimony-of-dr-diana-zuckerman-of-nchr-before-the-fda-advisory-committee-on-j-j-covid-vaccine/) about the Johnson &amp; Johnson trial, **“It’s misleading to tell the public that nobody who was vaccinated was hospitalized unless you also tell them that only 5 people in the placebo group were hospitalized.”** She’s right."
5820,"And you can’t be confident about predicting effectiveness precisely in a wider population outside the trial, either."
5821,"For example, some of the vaccine trials included relatively few people older than 60 as participants."
5822,You can see how fragile these numbers are by looking at those compiled for severe disease.
5823,"**In the** [**Pfizer trial**](https://www.fda.gov/media/144245/download)**, for example, just one vaccinated person developed severe COVID-19 versus three in the placebo group—which meant that a single bout of disease made the difference between a calculated efficacy rate of 66 percent and one of 100 percent."
5824,"** 

For the [Novavax](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-covid-19-vaccine-demonstrates-893-efficacy-uk-phase-3) and [Oxford-AstraZeneca](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/assessment-report/covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca-epar-public-assessment-report_en.pdf) trials, there were zero people with severe disease in the vaccinated group versus only one in the control group, so adding or subtracting one would have been even more dramatic."
5825,**The problem is even greater for deaths.
5826,"For that efficacy analysis, only two of the vaccine trials—for Moderna’s and Johnson &amp; Johnson’s—reported any COVID-19 deaths at all in the control groups."
5827,**
5828,Sure I agree with that if you have that option.
5829,"EU: ""wHaT hAs ThE uK eVeR dOnE FoR vAcCiNeS!?"
5830,"We get nothing back so we have a right to steal their AZ supplies!"""
5831,&gt; Massive CI
5832,Yeah so that is pretty good when you put it like that.
5833,Thanks.
5834,But if no one sits middle everyone wins two armrests lol
5835,Yes.
5836,But many states are dropping the mandates too early already.
5837,I think a lot of women would argue that the pill is necessary; lots of secondary issues controlled by it.
5838,"Migraines, debilitating cramps, anemia from excess bleeding, sex work, abuse relationships etc."
5839,There are continued studies about BCPs.
5840,"Hormonal birth control can increase breast cancer risk, but requires no procedures to use."
5841,"I would consider BCP cases, as those with pregnancy and COVID, to be something  worth considering in risk analysis."
5842,Is it worth taking the pill to control severe migraines if there's a low risk of TTP?
5843,The government here (The Netherlands) is holding a test event in a few weeks with 10.000 people where everyone is tested beforehand.
5844,"Meanwhile I can't go to uni, can't do sports, can't go to restaurant (even outside)."
5845,"All these testing events will cost us 1 billion, and is only available for a small number people."
5846,"What event will contribute is a mystery, as everyone will be vaccinated in the coming months.."
5847,This makes me feel a little better.
5848,Thanks.
5849,What are you talking about?
5850,"That's a very straight forward statement, and saying ""heh"" about it shows you have little empathy."
5851,You clearly don't work in a field where you are responsible for human lives.
5852,Just because the situation was also dramatic several months ago doesn't mean the new situation can only be called dramatic when it exceeds the previous numbers.
5853,Who are you to question the health care workers' feelings?
5854,"I am not a vaccine expert, but I help but be disappointed by a pause of J&amp;J for everyone in the US."
5855,We had a local clinic scheduled for J&amp;J for adult men who use a drop-in homeless shelter.
5856,"Outreach had a difficult to convince these residents to get a 1 dose vaccine, trying to convince these residents that a 2 dose vaccine is something they can do is even more difficult."
5857,These folks will be even more screwed if they get COVID (not to even mention the risk of spread within the shared shelter facility) than the possible rate of this specific type of blood clot that's being investigated.
5858,"Democrats: “voter ID is racist, it discriminates against those marginalized."
5859,"“

Democrats: “vaccine passport is a great idea, it won’t discriminate against those marginalized”

Pick one."
5860,"If you think voter ID is racist than carrying around your vaccination records with your picture along with, birth date etc is also discrimination."
5861,"You also need to consider alternative options, such as getting a different vaccine."
5862,"Gotta ask the Palestinians, living in Israel"
5863,People should be allowed to choose that is all
5864,"You also have to take into account the decision is not ""get the vaccine or not"", but it's more something like ""not take the AZ vaccine and get Pfizer in 3 months with less chance of rare brain clots""."
5865,Masks work -  but so do vaccines.
5866,"So as vaccines roll out, we can start laying the groundwork for eliminating mask mandates."
5867,the evidence has been there.
5868,"the problem is demanding 100% certainty, particularly in the context of a killer pandemic."
5869,"for instance, a retrospective study early on showed that daily aspirin use was associated with 50% lower covid19 mortality."
5870,"rational person would say, tell people to take daily aspirin at symptom onset, especially since they would be choosing between it and tylenol/ibuprofen anyways."
5871,the fundamental problem is at the heart of decision making in medicine.
5872,a more bayesian model is appropriate.
5873,"Yeah there must be some explanation, I just thought it was the case that the government was covering all that, and that would be why the one in my county is 100% free to the recipient no questions asked."
5874,"If I has to guess, I'd say it's a local / state government thing."
5875,"Like you said, maybe the state (or county or whatever) is funding the admin costs of our center."
5876,I’ll probably not feel better until May tbh.
5877,I have a pain in my stomach and last night I was up pretty late again.
5878,I’m gonna come back here and check on all of you every 4-5 days until we are all safe lol.
5879,"People working 3 jobs, gon' get paid."
5880,[removed]
5881,I think of you ask my friends this is what they would say about me as well
5882,"Right, but no one gets to choose if they get COVID."
5883,If people don't get vaccinated everyone will get COVID.
5884,To me there’s a real question that gets into ethics around whether AZ and J&amp;J should still be surged into developing countries with outbreaks (see: Brazil).
5885,"Feels elitist, but those countries probably around getting huge doses of Pfizer/Moderna anytime soon

Would seem to be a huge net save of lives"
5886,That's true but most countries will have enough supply when they will need to vaccinate under 30-40 people.
5887,Especially the EU.
5888,"Yeah, they definitely need to get to the bottom of it."
5889,"Like you said, if you had a choice, get the one that’s not causing issues."
5890,"I guess what I worry about it’s the increased vaccine hesitation in general because of this, which could end up costing more lives in the end."
5891,Yeah but the fruitcakes believe that God wants them getting the COVID brain clot and not the COVID vaccine blood clot.
5892,I would like to congratulate EMA and the European Union for yet another wise decision.
5893,Thanks for putting us in risk and prolonging lockdowns.
5894,"&gt; It would be better to describe it as about 10% per year so far

But will it be more than a year between AstraZeneca and mRNA availability for an individual?"
5895,"For someone living in a developed country, probably not"
5896,It doesn’t.
5897,It compares the rate of known COVID-positive cohort with an equivalent mRNA vaccinated cohort ( and those with influenza for reference).
5898,Only those can be used for any purpose.
5899,Got my first dose of Moderna yesterday.
5900,"Into the night the injection site swelled up and became rather painful, and I feel exhausted."
5901,In the middle of the night I felt  almost feverish - the kind of feeling right before fever kicks in during a bad cold.
5902,Woke up this morning being off with a headache.
5903,"If this is what a “very mild” case of COVID feels like, I don’t even want to imagine the real thing."
5904,P.S.
5905,: Never got adverse reaction beyond a sore arm from vaccines before.
5906,"Ah, that makes sense."
5907,"There are many confounding factors, such as vaccinated people being older in age on average."
5908,"Overall, it could be that the same characteristics that make the vaccine not work well in a person also makes them more susceptible to dying if they catch COVID with or without the vaccine."
5909,"&gt;In this case, the risk of catching COVID would have to be more than 1/8; from what I can tell the total infection rate in the USA is only about 1/10 and for someone who's taking precautions like masking and distancing, it's almost certainly even less."
5910,"If we don't get rid of covid-19, the probability of getting it becomes nearly 100%."
5911,It's only a question of time.
5912,"The risk of a serious healthy outcome even in young healthy folks is still minimally 1/1000, which is waaay worse than risk of negative vaccine reaction"
5913,Agree
5914,"Seems very reasonable, if Isreal is any indication we're 1-2 months out from very low numbers."
5915,We've also had a lot more natural infection than Isreal.
5916,Thanks for the award!
5917,They r freaking out for no reason whatsoever.
5918,Birth control has 1 in 1000 chance to develop clots whereas the vaccine 1 in 1000000.
5919,Yet we use birth control.
5920,The risks outweigh the benefits!

5922," I am from India, and I know 4 doctors who got hospitalized with severe symptoms even fully vaccinated."
5923,I think people who are downvoting me think that I am talking about the US.
5924,Typical Reddit Bias.
5925,Yeah that's what I meant by overall benefits to personal health in my last sentence.
5926,It's the direct comparison to COVID-related blood clots specifically that I think is unproductive.
5927,This reminds me of Va-poo-rize!
5928,But still if this works it would be an incredible asset to the fight against Covid!
5929,We have to use something to measure...
5930,I've seen individuals teams post to their social media giving shots to players.
5931,I think because eligibility rules were different in each state it would be harder to coordinate a date to bring a bunch of players together without some being see as skipping the line.
5932,"It would be nice now to see the NBA do something, maybe a PSA with images and clips from those team clinics."
5933,"&gt; The question of using AZ is not a non-question or hysteria, as some here claim it to be."
5934,Its a matter of risk assessment.
5935,Which people are hilariously bad at.
5936,Exactly.
5937,The vaccine side effects are definitely worth it vs getting extremely ill or dying of COVID.
5938,Here’s the thing though.
5939,"If everyone decided to not get a vaccine over the 1 in a million risk or whatever, the chance of getting COVID in the next few years is probably north of 50% since it wouldn’t go away 

Not getting a vax over side effect concerns is very selfish."
5940,It’s basically “everyone else take the 1 in a million risk and I’ll reap the benefits of herd immunity”
5941,"That's not a fair statistic, because out of all the vaccinated people, I'm assuming most of them still quarantine themselves."
5942,&gt;With a B.C.
5943,"ski resort at the centre of a P1 variant of concern outbreak, a local epidemiologist is sounding the alarm over outdoor COVID-19 transmission."
5944,"&gt;Cynthia Carr, an epidemiologist and founder of EPI Research Inc., says the outbreak is the largest P1 variant outbreak outside of Brazil."
5945,"&gt;“Outdoors, we want to be clear, that it is safer, but it is not safe."
5946,"An increase in risk indoors is also an increase in risk outdoors,” said Carr."
5947,"&gt;The P1, commonly known as the Brazil variant, is two and a half times more infectious than the original virus."
5948,While this variant has yet to be detected in Manitoba Carr given the opportunity to spread it will.
5949,"&gt;“With every person that transmits this virus is the opportunity to for mutations to occur,” said Carr."
5950,"They are choosing the role the dice on catching a very likely to catch disease that is many times more dangerous over all, including for brain clots than the AZ or JJ vaccine."
5951,"Vaccine: NOT a drug, administered to a HEALTHY person."
5952,"There is zero sense in comparing the risk introduced to a HEALTHY body by a man-made medical compound and the risks brought upon by a virus if and when a contraction causes a particular manifestation of the disease - at least unless you are a British publication ""defending the honor"" of a British vaccine with a specific risk profile."
5953,"I know a doctor who is ""fully vaccinated"" but does not have a detectable level of antibodies still."
5954,"This is in Brazil and with one of the Chinese vaccines, but still... that would be #2 on your list I guess."
5955,Great answer!
5956,Not seen it put like this before.
5957,Yes she’s pretty solid.
5958,I’ve no problem with her.
5959,Bit miserable but whatever.
5960,It’s not actually true that each county has a department of health.
5961,"Delaware County, PA does not have one and it has a population of over half a million people."
5962,I would bet rural counties with small populations don’t have them either.
5963,"Depends on how much longer COVID continues to be prevalent in the community, what kind of precautions an individual is taking against it, what local case rates are in one's specific community, etc."
5964,All just things that go to show that it's not apples-to-apples and everyone's situation is different.
5965,"But yes if for whatever reason someone is unable to speak to a doctor about their own personal situation, my opinion is still that the prevailing advice should be to get vaccinated."
5966,Certainly the countries that are much more dependent on non-mRNA vaccines than the USA should not be turning their noses at it.
5967,The CDC has messaging issues because of the way this whole thing has been politicized.
5968,They have to be very careful about declaring things safe because whatever they say is going to be attacked.
5969,"Back in the early days, we were told to stop buying masks because there were mask shortages and hospitals were having a hard time getting ahold of them."
5970,Then we were told to wear masks when it was discovered how easily transmissible it was in the air.
5971,To this day people use that as an attack on the CDC.
5972,"""First they tell us *this* and then they tell us *that."
5973,* They keep chaining their minds.
5974,"They don't know what they're doing."""
5975,"Because of this idiocy, I can understand why the CDC would drag their feet on this."
5976,"Because if last May they declared surfaces to be safe, and then a few months later on discovered that surfaces aren't as safe as they thought, it would create a lot of confusion in the public and it would give the Republicans a new line of attack to try and discredit the CDC."
5977,No.
5978,well that settles it officials should definitely ban Covid too
5979,Context matters.
5980,"If the expected is 2 out of 1.5 million, 6 out of 1.5 million is WAY above expectations."
5981,Triple the number in fact.
5982,"Sounds scary, sounds huge, but then you see it's still 6 out of 1.5 million, and your risk of doing many every day activities is vastly more dangerous, and then you see that the risk of COVID causing this type clotting is greater than this ""elevated"" risk."
5983,"I can accept a ""pause"" if it's mainly to make sure health officials have the necessary guidance to look for and treat this rare issue, but if it turns into the sort of ""pause"" where they eventually just drop it quietly like some countries have done with AZ, it's a shambles, and sets a terrible benchmark."
5984,"What if they find something equally rare but ""concerning"" with the mRNA vaccines?"
5985,"We going to can those because of a miniscule risk and just say ""whoopsie, guess you gotta just dodge COVID instead because that 1 in a million risk is too high :)""?"
5986,I go the virus.
5987,"Fuck this, I was super cautious the entire time and I still got it, because my roommate went to work everyday and he contracted it probably in public transport or somewhere at work."
5988,"So far I am feeling fine, but the incubation period isn‘t over so yeah."
5989,I thought I could escape the virus but here we are.
5990,Be cautious people.
5991,"IMO, the J&amp;J is getting a bad rap."
5992,They paused the vaccine due to 6 serious issues out of almost 7 million doses.
5993,Like most vaccines there is a small risk of serious issues and even death.
5994,You have higher odds of dying from Covid if unvaccinated than dying from getting the vaccine.
5995,"When hospitals charge you $80 for a pair of socks during outpatient procedures, you can imagine how terrifying it is to think about a shot that is really in demand."
5996,This is how Ohio has been for awhile now.
5997,"No capacity limits, but masks and social distancing."

6005,I had made this same statement a while back complaining that the math is much more complicated.
6006,Someone had replied that someone else had already done the math for me.
6007,Here is the link on the total risk of getting Covid and having severe disease compared to getting the rare HIT like clotting issue from vaccines.
6008,https://wintoncentre.maths.cam.ac.uk/news/communicating-potential-benefits-and-harms-astra-zeneca-covid-19-vaccine/
6009,Why?
6010,"They didn't design the vaccine, that was the BioNTech."
6011,They partnered with Pfizer testing and manufacture.
6012,"I don't disagree that they deserve credit and remuneration for this, but they didn't develop it."
6013,&gt;It doesn’t nor attempts to study the rate on Ad vector vaccines.
6014,It gives us a statistic for unvaccinated COVID cases that is useful for *evaluating* the rate seen in the adenovirus vector vaccines.
6015,"I think Memorial Day will be a turning point, even if they don't officially drop mandates or open things up."
6016,At that point I think basically anyone that wants to be vaccinated will be.
6017,I got $122 bill(after getting student discount on a $420ish bill) just for getting a COVID and COVID antibody test.
6018,Good I have the insurance to cover it.
6019,So I won’t be surprised if they are actually charging people for vaccine if they didn’t have insurance.
6020,OMG bring this to Germany please 🥺 we need this badly
6021,"See, I told you these vaccines don’t even work."
6022,/s
6023,I understand and I agree but I also find it funny how all those British papers comes up with excuses for using their vaccine when there is another choice which has not been linked to causing blood cloths.
6024,"If someone is concerned they can always get the other one, AZ and JJ needs to find out which subset of people are having issues with their vaccine."
6025,"Given the choice between on that gives me a small chance of complication and another that does not, I want the one that doesn’t."
6026,I have a question.
6027,This article says it’s hard to fight misinformation coming from these people because they’re posting factual articles.
6028,It also says that we’re caught in a temporary vacuum of real guidance as we investigate what’s going on with the blood clotting.
6029,Does it seem a little bit like we’re holding onto these vaccines based on faith?
6030,"That in the face of some (admittedly rare) negative side effects and a lack of conclusive evidence that they’re of no concern, we’re just holding our breath and stepping out in faith?"
6031,"Are we saying “I just know in my heart that the vaccines are safe,” and waiting for the science to catch up with that belief?"
6032,"If so, it doesn’t seem much different from those on the opposite side of the fence, who “just know” that the vaccines are dangerous."
6033,"Are we willing to change our opinions based on evidence, as we insist they must?"
6034,Please double fact check reddit posts.
6035,"More often than not, people spout bullshit on here that's just convincing because they speak with authority and post too many links for you to actually check in any reasonable amount of time."
6036,She said she'd wait until it's allowed for her
6037,"It could be an undercount, but more likely is that the people who get infected despite being vaccinated are strong candidates for death already."
6038,You can't really measure it the way you're trying to.
6039,"At my city's vaxx event, we were told it was for covering administrative fees."
6040,Still uncharted territory for how this will effect long term efficacy!
6041,How about the 1% death rate?
6042,Or 0.1% with a 1/10 catching?
6043,Seems higher than the blood clot
6044,Go get the J&amp;J Vaccine in 6 months when you’re due up again if you’re not concerned.
6045,"Interestingly, the US is exactly where Israel was when they began their steep decrease in early February."
6046,"On February 7, Israel reported 37.7% with at least one shot and 22.2% fully vaccinated."
6047,"Today, the US is 37.3% and 23.1%, respectively."
6048,"Obviously Israel was moving much faster with its vaccination campaign which likely compounded the effect of the nosedive in cases, but I'm excited to see how the US fares now that it has reached a point where we could theoretically see vaccination effects start to take place."
6049,"I'm still feeling great about the vaccines as well, but I feel that it should be pointed out that lots of those 77 million haven't had much time to get infected."
6050,"For instance, some who became fully vaccinated yesterday would be in that count but literally wouldn't have had enough time to get infected, develop symptoms or realize they should get tested, get tested, get their test results back, and have that result included in official numbers."
6051,"I mean financially it’s going to make sense for the employer to have his entire workforce vaccinated as soon as possible, so he made his mind to make his incentives strong."
6052,Heart of gold aside it’s a savvy move and it also makes him look good
6053,"I was convinced that my regular provider would find some way to monetize this and I would get stuck with a bill, so I went to a local pharmacy and got the injections there."
6054,This is my thought too.
6055,More people are going to end up getting infected with Covid because of a 1 in a million chance that people develop these blood clots.
6056,Public health decisions should be focused on the broader situation and not individual outcomes with this low a level of issues imho.
6057,Probably it is useful to take a look at greater time scales.
6058,The long term risk of getting covid depends on immunization of the people.
6059,If you chose not to take the vaccine you can be lucky and belong to the 30% protected by herd immunity or you get the disease eventually.
6060,In this picture of herd immunity the individual risk of blood cloths is independent from the infection rate.
6061,Then a comparison between vaccine and disease may be appropriate.
6062,"I honestly don't know and from the comments I've seen here and talking to some friends, they are just scared completely witless and won't feel comfortable until there is something that they feel is 100% protection."
6063,"It's weird to me that some people so completely embrace the disruption and fear, it's like they have been wanting this to happen and finally have their excuse."
6064,You are getting downvoted because you imply you know a lot of vaccinated hospitalized individuals.
6065,That's not statistically possible.
6066,"""I know quite a few people who got vaccinated even with the second dose get admitted to the hospital with severe symptoms. """
6067,"For the younger and/or healthier they are being asked to either take the low risk of catching a disease which has an even lower risk of harming them, or taking a vaccine which for them may be a largely unknown factor."
6068,There aren't many places where you can ask sincere questions about vaccine risk without being met with some form of hostility.
6069,Sorry for calling you a troll.
6070,I know new information is coming at us left and right.
6071,Did you see this too?
6072,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/covid-brain-clot-astrazeneca-vaccine-b1831876.html
6073,"It doesn't say how many of the deaths were over 60, though."
6074,That's the stat that matters here.
6075,I'm also guessing many of the high profile players are refusing to get vaccinated.
6076,Would you be surprised if Kyrie thought it was all a hoax?
6077,Part of me wouldn't even be surprised if this happened even though they never even asked for insurance.
6078,"Heh, this is pretty much the vaguest statement ever."
6079,"Of course the situation in ICUs is worsening, as the case tally was growing fast until a few days ago (and it's still growing although not as fast)."
6080,"Still doesn't mean by itself that the situation in hospitals is ""dramatic""."
6081,The chance of catching covid is more than 1/10.
6082,"It would be better to describe it as about 10% per year so far, given that COVID still exists and continues to infect new people."
6083,"This differs than any risk associated with the vaccine which is a one-time risk, rather than an ongoing risk like getting COVID."
6084,As a result the magnitude of risk with covid is higher than what your back of the napkin math is suggesting.
6085,It's not a big deal.
6086,"The vaccines prevented hospitalization and death in the trial, but in the real world you run into situations where people have factors that make the vaccines much less effective."
6087,If you did analysis on these 74 deaths you'd likely find that there other very significant risk factors at play that made the vaccine a long shot for them.
6088,"You have to understand we've vaccinated hundreds of millions of people, there are going to be some people that the vaccine just isn't going to do much for."
6089,"This is a tiny number, though."

6185,We’re looking at vaccinating maybe down to people in the 30s?
6186,"There are still going to be tons of young adults and kids who won’t be vaccinated who will catch it, often without knowing, pass it on and it will mutate away."

6193,"The rationally self-interested actor will evaluate a simple formula to determine whether to take the vaccine: if risk of vaccine &lt; risk of COVID x probability of COVID, then you take the vaccine."
6194,Otherwise you reject.
6195,"This is why I actually fundamentally get the inherent skepticism of anti-vaxxers, because IF there are rare side effects, health experts and government agencies would have tremendous incentive to hide them because it’s still better for society to be vaccinated, even if they have to break a couple eggs along the way."
6196,"If people realize they can effectively still achieve zero risk of contracting a disease by herd immunity while avoiding the vaccine themselves and avoiding any side effects or risk, then the rationally self-interested decision is to reject vaccination."
6197,"Problem is, if too many people do it, society won’t achieve herd immunity in the first place."

6202,"If MRNA vaccines could be proven to be safe as a general thing, and the infrastructure could be set up to quickly make the things, we might be entering a new era of rapidly rolling out specifically targeted vaccines right away when we hear about a new virus."
6203,Sure.
6204,I think it would be madness to keep vaccine passports beyond the end of the pandemic though.
6205,"As soon as we’ve gotten to a point where deaths become a rounding error in the grand scheme of things, I can’t imagine there’s any need for a vaccine passport."

6221,Because getting to world-wide herd immunity is hard and very unlikely.
6222,"We've been trying to eradicate polio for decades, and that vaccine is much easier to store and administer and far cheaper."
6223,"It'll probably be like measles, where first world countries have herd immunity, but still get flare ups due to reintroduction from a reservoir in the third world."
6224,that's not the case... in the US pfizer and moderna are by far doing the heavy lifting on vaccinations anyway.... jnj was only accounting for 3% of the vaccinations... what's the problem with pausing those when you have more than enough supply to ensure anyone who wants vaccines can get one?
6225,Change in cases day over day is essentially meaningless and not really relevant to any sort of analysis on how the pandemic is going.
6226,If it's a social then its following toxicity is not far.

6233,But the high rate of clot with AZ could just be covid...
6234,"That's a great point -- the vaccine clotting risk definitely appears to be higher for healthy young women (than average), and could make the decision tougher if a healthy young woman is also less likely to be severely ill from COVID (than average)"
6235,Airborne is not the same as droplet.
6236,"In terms of viruses, an example of airborne disease is measles."
6237,"It can spread through the air, and remain viable in the air for hours."
6238,"Airborne spread allows the virus to float freely on its own, as a viral particle."
6239,Droplet spread is different and it isn’t airborne.
6240,"The virus is coated in respiratory secretions, mucus, or saliva, so it can’t exactly float in the air the way an airborne virus can."
6241,"The liquid surrounding the viral particles falls to the ground, taking the virus with it."
6242,"The virus can’t survive well after the liquids around it evaporate, which is one reason it’s unlikely to become infected by touching a surface then touching your eyes, nose, or mouth."
6243,"The droplet, though it travels through air for a short distance, is not considered airborne."
6244,Covid can (and does) aerosolize and become airborne.
6245,"It happens when a patient in the hospital is having a breathing tube taken out, because of the techniques used in the procedure."
6246,"It’s a really specific scenario to the hospital setting, though."
6247,"In the “real world”, or day to day life, it would be very unlikely for you to encounter the virus in an airborne state — for example, if you walk into an unoccupied room, you are unlikely to become infected by virus in the air leftover from people in the same room an hour before."
6248,It’s the close contact (less than 6 feet apart and unmasked) with an infected person that will spread droplets.
6249,I guess the data we're missing is how many times higher is the chance of these clots for people with covid?
6250,Kids don’t need to be vaccinated.

6255,"Normal, within the range of expected reactions."
6256,I don't get why everyone mentions covid in the terms of death or hospitalization.
6257,"Even for some demographics that it can be comparable to the regular flu, it can suck losing your sense of taste/smell or being sick for a few days."
6258,"As far as I understand, most hospitals only take the more sick people anyways."

6261,Between Dec. 27 and March 26

6263,Vaccines aren’t always effective anyway.
6264,"In the UK (and lots of other places I assume) all people over a certain age or who are vulnerable are offered a flu vaccine, and still thousands die every year."
6265,"Covid is even more contagious than the flu and while it’s knocking around children and young people without causing too much trouble, barely even being noticed, it could well keep on mutating away and coming back every winter like the flu."
6266,"Sometimes it’s a mild variant, sometimes it’s more deadly."
6267,I’m gonna report this like I did the other day and tell you individual numbers are meaningless
6268,Then again there’s a huge lack of this kind of experiments for ethical reasons.
6269,"I’m glad they’re going through with it and it could provide useful data for the next pandemic (I mean let’s be honest, this will happen again)."
6270,Event venues and clubs never even got a chance to prove they can do it right.

6280,"I recommend you wait, I wish I had known I was at such an elevated risk"
6281,"In Australia, it’s basically impossible to get anything except AstraZeneca- my scheduled first vaccination was cancelled because blood clot risk."
6282,My mum died of Covid and my partner is immuno compromised.
6283,"1 in 200,000 risk of blood clots that you can screen for by getting a blood factor count  to see if you’re at increased risk (I’m not) and you can take aspirin for a couple of days after the vaccine to reduce the risk further."
6284,I’d love to have Pfizer available here - but the WTO / TRIPS waiver bullshit is affecting a lot of the world while nations that shit the bed handling the pandemic fuck with the rest of the world’s ability to manufacture vaccines now they’re available to preserve the political fictions.
6285,We’ve achieved *infinite spread*
6286,"&gt; People are worried about getting this rare clot from vaccine, when they are significantly more likely to get it from COVID."
6287,Do you know if this is the same rate across all ages or just an average?
6288,If the blood clot from covid risk is lower for the female &lt;50 range that could affect the comparison.

6361,Hard to say but I think people think of this as being some magical threshold where you cross a line and then the disease vanishes.
6362,It’s not.
6363,It’s a point where individual infection isn’t likely to lead to chains of infection.

6400,People that are not specifically seeking out information would know nothing.
6401,They wouldn't know when they are eligible let alone what the cost is.
6402,It's shocking compared to how much they communicate for completely innocuous things like spraying for moths.
6403,They send multiple letters and send someone to knock on everyone's door just to explain that we don't need to take any action other than to expect low flying aircraft.

6421,"It seems like people who live in big cities are more likely to want the vaccine, but there’s lower uptake in rural areas."
6422,"But the big cities is where the worst of the spread was happening, so even if rural areas never hit herd immunity, the cities having it might be enough."
6423,Exactly.

6506,It's on the news 24/7.
6507,It's like the first GD thig they say.
6508,It's free.
6509,Don't let anyone tell you it isn't.
6510,People just don't read or pay attention ffs.
6511,It's like people are trying to be stupid.
6512,Yeah I bet it’s more about “not Indy” than anything else.
6513,Here in IL any decent ish sized city was booked out forever.
6514,As soon as you hit red IL though it was super easy to book next day vaccines.
6515,I got my first shot I’m Danville.
6516,I set up the appointment the day before and was one of three people there.
6517,Walgreens put my second shot like 4-5 weeks out so on my third week I just hit another hick town that was closer for a next day appointment.
6518,"Now Chicago has its own odd set of restrictions so the Gary site might as well be for Chicago at this point, heh."
6519,"Anyway, congrats on the jab!"
6520,Definitely more symptoms/side-effects with second shot.
6521,"Had the shot about 9am and didn't feel anything until the afternoon, and that was just some mild aches (and crazy arm pain just like with the first shot)."
6522,The mild aches lasted a day or two.
6523,"The most difficult part wasn't until about 6:30pm, and thankfully it was a relatively brief period of time."
6524,"Severe chills and myalgia set in about 6:30pm, along with high fever (103.7 at its peak around 8 or 9pm) and some dizziness throughout."
6525,I shook for maybe 2-3 hours because I couldn't get warm.
6526,The myalgia made it hard to walk (seriously!)
6527,and get comfortable when sitting or laying.
6528,It was painful.
6529,My fingers (and everything else) hurt quite badly.
6530,"I was concerned about my fever being so high, but thankfully, as quickly as it all came on, by 11pm those significantly painful and impairing side effects dissapated."
6531,I was then back to those initial mild aches and nothing else.
6532,It was worth it to now be vaccinated and I'd do it again.
6533,Those 4-5 hours were debilitating though.
6534,I'm so thankful the worst of it didn't last any longer.
6535,100%
6536,"Maybe the community vaccination center is fully funded one way or another and does not need to recoup administration costs, compared to a drug store chain that is going to want to recoup its administrative costs from either the insurance companies or the government."
6537,&gt; The people not vaccinated are young and healthy.
6538,I'm young and healthy AND partially vaccinated.
6539,At this point I don't care much after being fairly careful this whole thing.
6540,"Yea, no one is suing anyone over $80."
6541,But then some good for nothing lazy bum will be insured while I will be working.
6542,/s Republicans.
6543,"I mean, open stuff, but wearing masks and keeping some distancing seems like a reasonable thing to do when numbers are creeping back up and we can’t snap fingers and instantly have everyone vaccinated."
6544,It was 90% according to CDC for Mederna and Pfizer.
6545,We understand so much more about this virus now than we did last summer.
6546,Last summer yes it was kind of necessary.
6547,Hardly anyone alive has been through something like this before so I “get it”.
6548,But it’s been a year and a half.
6549,I need the “experts” to fucking come on now.
6550,Enough with the hedging and double talk.
6551,I was actually surprised by this post
6552,[removed]
6553,I’m struggling to understand why we are seeing increasing covid cases in the US with people not receiving the vaccine (plus the fact that so many people have gotten COVID already).
6554,Is this simply because all states have not opened up to gen pop?
6555,I would think younger age segments are the true spreaders.
6556,PS.
6557,I’m a believer in vaccines and this isn’t written with any intention to understate how amazing it is that vaccines are being distributed
6558,Well how do you quantify that?
6559,A friend in Vancouver tested positive Sunday.
6560,No vax.
6561,His temp went to 99.2.
6562,Light cough.
6563,That's it.
6564,The effects on him were nil.
6565,So...
6566,Well veganism works for me and that's all I care about :)
6567,My vaccine was administered at my work by Walgreens in January.
6568,"They asked for my insurance information, I was told that there was a $50 administration fee."
6569,"Insurance companies say something that should be covered isn’t, so they refuse to pay."
6570,"Then you have to dispute it with them, which can be a frustrating experience even if you’re 100% right and they pay out."
6571,Brilliant analysis.
6572,Agree completely.
6573,"&gt; If 30 percent of your students die

[So according to the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm), out of the 545,751 deaths involving Covid, 258 of them have been aged 0 to 17."
6574,"Do you have any idea how far off from ""30% of students"" we are?"
6575,What an absurd thing to say.
6576,"If I had an Az or J&amp;J appointment for tomorrow, and that was the only choice, I'd get it with no qualms whatsoever."
6577,"The pandemic is still raging, and we're talking single digits out of a million of severe side effect or death from the vaccine, vs. a few orders of magnitude higher risk of death or hospitalization over the next year from the disease itself."
6578,"It’s becoming clear that some states are likely going to struggle to get to 50% vaccinated, while others are going to hit 80%+."
6579,"Multiple theories

A. it's plain not true."
6580,Information does get distorted easily even without intentional distortion.
6581,B.
6582,"Bad vaccine batch (if they worked together they could have vaccinated together)

C. They are all asymptomatic/very mild."
6583,So vaccine did work at some level...
6584,I didn’t know it was free but went anyway cause I want this nonsense to be done with and hope everyone gets it
6585,It’s pretty ridiculous.
6586,The CDC’s decision is definitely going to do more harm than good.
6587,What State?
6588,Why is it not available?
6589,"Sorry I’m on mobile, fixed the link now"
6590,[removed]
6591,Do you realize how many people need to get this vaccine to find something like this?
6592,Like if other medications had this problem their is a good chance we never know about it.
6593,Exactly!
6594,People who dont believe that covid is real probably already got it from uncle JimBob's Superbowl party.
6595,They can be skeptics all they want but they cant deny the antibodies (unless they get measles and their immune system resets).
6596,-_-
6597,I wonder in there maybe a correlation with interactions from birth control?
6598,Like a moderate to bad cold
6599,&gt;There's a reason we're ahead of the EU in population with a first dose AND in total doses per 100 people.
6600,USA.
6601,That's literally the only reason.
6602,It's not rational to keep high transmission places like schools open and instead restrict activities that aren't linked with frequent transmission when your goal is to reduce the number of new infections.
6603,&gt; I get a bill from LabCorp for $500.
6604,For a single test.
6605,The same test is $50 at a walk in lab
6606,"Colleges were
Supposedly supposed to be reformed as well."
6607,They came through unscathed.
6608,[deleted]
6609,You *always* pay for it.
6610,Some transactions are just more straightforward than others.
6611,"This is 100% a ""both-sides"" thing."
6612,"One side made it political by saying ""we don't want to wear masks for [insert whatever reason here]"" and then the other side responded with ""NOT WEARING MASKS MAKES YOU BAD AND EVIL AND YOU ARE AN EVIL PERSON FOR NOT WEARING THEM"" which did not help in the slightest."
6613,Can you give a citation for this?
6614,Meanwhile I wouldn’t let my kids go maskless until they were vaccinated.
6615,"Their safety would come before “normalcy”, but you do you bro."
6616,But Dr fossey said there was extremely minimal risk for sending children back to school and that all children should go back to school!

6634,but how do you know what % of people this side effects impact when there's a 2-3 week lead time on this?
6635,"further since this is heavily skewing towards a certain demographic... their risk factors could be approaching their risk of catching covid and getting hospitalized.... hospitalizations rates for 20-45 yo women is quite small also...

we can pause jnj for 2-4 weeks and still hit every target.... the alternative is to keep giving people vaccines with side effects that you don't understand.... if this happened in trials were they going to get EUA's when you try to handwave these side effects?"
6636,I've been wondering about this and if such an effect existed.
6637,Do you have any furt information on that?
6638,I'm curious to read about it.
6639,"I have really good health insurance and when I logged onto my healthcare portal with my doctor, all I had to do was register for a group."
6640,And when the state made that group available they immediately had appointments for me.
6641,Thanks!

6643,"If 30 percent of your students die, how will it be in your classroom or school then?"

6645,"That being said, if by August every American who wants to be vaccinated can get one, I don’t care what happens to the antivaxxers."
6646,They can play their stupid games and win their stupid prizes.
6647,You guys got paid to get the vaccine?
6648,All I got was some chills and a sore arm.
6649,I got ripped off!
6650,At least wait until everyone will have been given the chance to get the vaccine.
6651,"It's easy to say ""go get it."""
6652,"But a lot of people who want vaccines aren't eligible yet, or there aren't enough appointments available."
6653,Walgreens told me to go CVS because I have Aetna insurance.

&gt;There is a misconception that children are at zero risk for Covid, says Dr Fatima Marinho, who is also a senior adviser to the international health NGO Vital Strategies."
6737,Marinho's research has found that a shockingly high number of children and babies have been affected by the virus.
6738,"&gt;Between February 2020 and 15 March 2021, Covid-19 killed at least 852 of Brazil's children up to the age of nine, including 518 babies under one year old, according to figures from the Brazilian Ministry of Health."
6739,But Dr Marinho estimates that more than twice this number of children died of Covid.
6740,"A serious problem of underreporting due to lack of Covid testing is bringing the numbers down, she says."
6741,"&gt;Dr Marinho calculated the excess of deaths by unspecified acute respiratory syndrome during the pandemic, and found that there were 10 times more deaths by unexplained respiratory syndrome than in previous years."
6742,"By adding these numbers, she estimates that the virus in fact killed 2,060 children under nine years old, including 1,302 babies."
6743,…
6744,Yup.
6745,"No matter how brief the pause, the damage has been done."
6746,More so than previous years?
6747,\&gt;and the anticipated incidence is roughly in the single digits per *million* individuals &gt;vaccinated.

6749,"They didn't stop using it for no reason in the under 60 age group here in Germany and I really wish these posts that go out of their way to minimise the risk, would make it clear that they don't really know the exact incidence rate any more than the people that might inflate the incidence of the blood clots."
6750,"Really what the EMA and WHO have said is that the ""risk is worth the reward"" and that statement is probably true from a raw numbers standpoint."

6798,"Later in the autumn and traditional 'flu season', were we had a delayed (compared to EU) peak, maybe that caused people to relax, but because spread was incresing - so has the mitigation steps been doing too during december, and that re-initiated effort begun showing effect until currently when the more transmissable mutation has more or less taken over."
6799,"I would say it's in the balance still to introduce stricter yet recommendations/mitigations, but increasingly more unlikely as vaccinations are progressing pretty well."

6984,"We also went an entire week with under 1,000 deaths every day"
6985,"America big, Europe small"

7014,The problem with using transmission rates is that masks lower that.
7015,"Lockdowns in the UK weren't formally tied to transmission rates, but they were obviously used in the decisions, and we saw how that went: Transmission rates were low enough to end lockdown, without lockdown transmission rates went back up, and it was back to lockdown."

7018,I’m just overly cautious about it.
7019,My class has gone all year without any of the kids getting sick or quarantined and I didn’t want it to start now.
7020,Besides if they show symptoms within 2-3 days of being at school (so by Sat or Sun) we all have to quarantine anyway.
7021,Well yup.
7022,It is a pretty mixed message.
7023,And the people that are skeptical are probably not listening to reputable information sources to begin with.
7024,They need to figure out how to get a more positive message in front of these people's noses.
7025,"An ""expert"" getting both shots and then continuing to wear two masks and avoiding indoor public places is not that message."
7026,It will take time to get used to normalcy again.
7027,"If you are around other vaccinated people the risk is very low, even if the J&amp;J vaccine is not as effective as the mRNA ones."
7028,I would suggest taking your time and slowly increasing your expose to others.
7029,That’s not reassuring.
7030,"Considering kinds and considering COVID is pretty much nothing for kids, vaccines which cause rare diseases are a no go for them."
7031,And then it becomes questionable until which age is it beneficial to get such a vaccination.
7032,Since New Hampshire isn't conservative this will receive a fraction of the blowback Texas got for ending their mask mandate
7033,"I know several people, myself included, who have had allergic reactions to other vaccines are were explicitly told to get J&amp;J. I had an appointment this week that was cancelled and I’m pretty devastated."

7035,How is the counting making here?

7037,"&gt; Russia, Switzerland, South Korea, Brazil and South Africa are all producing doses but lag behind the five producers on our chart."

7076,"What if J&amp;J can be used again but those of us who got J&amp;J before no longer feel comfortable with it and don’t want to get a booster of J&amp;J, would we be able to get a booster shot of one of the other ones?"
7077,"Probably aren’t answers to this yet, but any insight would be very helpful to ease my anxious mind."
7078,Thank you!
7079,I'm thinking that part of the reason for such strong reactions among a pretty high percentage of people is because of how close the booster is to the initial shot.
7080,Most boosters are further apart.

7082,"It's called a josh brother, an object needs to be removed."

So?"
7084,"No matter if they receive the vaccine or not, their taxes are the same so why does it matter if the person worrying about the cost pays part of their income and purchases to the state?"
7085,"First, my obvious joke has flown over some individuals heads and now I question the importance being brought up in regards to comments in this thread that have been stated."
7086,"Obviously the vaccine isn't ""free free,"" but the average individual understands that governments use taxes to run and that actions they do with the taxes they receive is technically not free, so individuals who like to point out that stuff from the government isn't free are stating the already known."

7098,"No vaccine is 100% effective in preventing serious illness, that in itself should have been a huge red flag that the pharma giant was lying about its product (shocking I know)."
7099,Less density.
7100,Biden's original stated goal was 100M doses in 100 days.
7101,We're now close to 100M doses *per month* in 100 days.
7102,Does this mean that grade schools won't be able to make students wear masks?
7103,I was able to get an appointment for the Pfizer vaccine.
7104,"I had wanted Moderna, as it seemed safer."
7105,Should I be worried?
7106,It’s more like 20% fully vaccinated and 56% have received at least one dose.
7107,what about: mandatory for those older than 50?
7108,New Hampshire is at 56% vaccinated so it’s somewhere around Israel’s level of vaccination.
7109,I honestly think it’s time for them to do this and I’ll be interested to see the results
7110,"What I can’t get my head around: If you are vaccinated and get COVID mildly, does it mean you will always get it mildly?"
7111,(Whenever you get it).
7112,It’s not clear.
7113,"Because these 74 people that died, obviously got it within a specific time frame (and that time frame has been quite short as we haven’t live with vaccines for very long yet)."
7114,"If the virus is here to stay, and it is not ‘guaranteed’ you get it mildly, after you have had the vaccine, that means this 0.0001% chance of still dying or whatever, might get magnified by the amounts of times you get exposed to the virus, until you eventually catch it severely."
7115,"All these numbers seem meaningless to me until it becomes clear whether one can or can’t catch it severely, after repeated exposure to it."
7116,Does it make sense?
7117,[removed]
7118,"thats why all eyes will be on Israel, Usa and Uk when they reach 75% vaccinated"
7119,"I don't give a shit about anybody in New Hampshire, but I do find it weird that they'd end mask mandates now instead of line a month from now when more people have that vaccine you mentioned."
7120,Donald Trump's daughter got the vaccine and posted about it but was met with hate.
7121,This kind of headline makes me more inclined towards antivaxers agenda
7122,Interesting moral conundrum.
7123,"However, if you did everything in your reasonable power to prevent infecting the town of southern Baptists by getting a vaccine and properly wearing a mask for as long as your government required it, and anti-science jackasses still suffered an outbreak due to their poor risk analysis skills and disbelief in reality, then I'd say you not ethically responsible."
7124,Blame covid.
7125,"I'm in rural TX, the big multi-county vaccine hub my county participated in will be closing due to a significant drop in demand."
7126,They started vaccinating in January and got through the waiting list by the beginning of April.
7127,Every adult who wants a vaccine can get one now here.
7128,So it looks like everyone in our multi-county region who wanted one got one.
7129,"After they shut down the mass vaccine hub, people who decide they want a vaccine here will have  to find a pharmacy administering them."
7130,"I mean, they did administer thousands and thousands of vaccines from January to April."
7131,But in terms of the populations of all the covered counties combined?
7132,"Vaccine coverage is still low out here, many people opted out."
7133,"The J&amp;J efficacy seems to be increase over time, with limited data the efficacy at 40+ days looked very strong."
7134,The trial was also conducted partially in South Africa which had a particularly difficult variant that seems to have broadly lost out to more transmissive variants.
7135,"So by and large I feel safe, and will feel even safer once I reach that 50 day mark."
7136,"cant, cause any study is worthless if you add variants"
7137,J&amp;J is extremely good at protecting you from severe illness.
7138,"I would go about your life as normal as possible, as I'm hoping to do in a little more than a week when my J&amp;J is fully effective."
7139,"I will likely keep wearing a mask on public transport for now (until our total case number goes down, it's quite high at the moment and vaccine demand is still high), but other than that the mask is coming off when the state mandate is removed."
7140,But you have to look at this beyond just what the article is saying.
7141,If we need a booster shot there will always be medical people who are too cautious saying we need to maintain some level of covid mitigation.
7142,That idea needs to be torpedoed immediately...

7150,*
7151,They only looked at severe symptoms.
7152,They didn't just test people to see if they had mild or asymptomatic infections.
7153,I thought that this was pretty well-known.
7154,it's why it didn't tell us if people could still catch and spread the virus after vaccination.
7155,[removed]
7156,That’s Pfizer you brain dead fuck...
7157,Endemic virus laughs at your futile masks
7158,But how will pharmacy's get freezers for -80C?
7159,Yeah the EU really over promised and underdelivered.
7160,I’m honestly not sure why they were so cocky with their supply.
7161,concerts sport people?
7162,banned for at least 2 more years.
7163,"students in schools depends on the numbers of infections+your leaders

everything else: leaders"
7164,They're certainly morally superior to the UK who sent 800.000 shots to covid free Australia while thousands of people are dying every day.
7165,That’s why I don’t understand about people saying they don’t have to mask outside.
7166,"I can’t step foot outside without immediately seeing someone, or being within a few feet of someone."
7167,"You see, if I take the ""get your free flu shots"" coupon for Walgreens that I get every single year at work since I started working, I never had to worry about risking it."
7168,I read that as Some Religions Resist but that’s probably even more accurate.
7169,"I see, lots of sites don't specify between one dose and fully vaccinated."
7170,Did you mask up and distance during flu season when you were near newborns and older people?
7171,Wow!
7172,Id suggest there is a very blurry line between some of the more public scientists and the media.
7173,I haven't calculated the crude death rate for a while but this is one of the few agencies reporting deaths by age and incidence by age so the mortality rate and can be calculated.
7174,"https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Daten/Klinische_Aspekte.html

However it may hinge on our definition of young."
7175,I am counting it as people between 18 and 49.
7176,Good point!
7177,J&amp;J is much more stable than Pfizer and Moderna at reasonable temperatures.
7178,Still a huge logistics challenge though.
7179,But Pfizer has similar risk of clotting according to UK data.
7180,Norway is part of the EU's vaccine procurement program so in that regards it's pretty much the same
7181,%95 efficacy is tested with limited number of people during phase-3 studies.
7182,So it is not multiplicative community protection.
7183,"With enough number of people to be vaccinated, that number can easily get to %100."
7184,"The %95 number is for personal protection, because phase-3 studies are not done by vaccinating whole society and evalutaing its effects on potential herd immunity."
7185,"That's phase-4 we are experiencing now, and Israel example shows it can be %100 effective given enough people (~%60-65?)"
7186,is vaccinated.
7187,I wonder if in theory they could find a way to combine a flu shot and a covid shot into a single shot to make it even easier on people.
7188,"Vaccination of the elderly, especially those living in nursing homes."
7189,It's probably going to be dependent on global spread.
7190,That's what's driving all the variants that erode vaccine efficacy.
7191,Suppression measures are going to turn out to have been more important than many Western countries choose to acknowledge and a global vaccine regime will be required to slow down the mutation rate.
7192,"I expect it will take some time before either of those things happen, especially because global vaccination likely means breaking the patents/IP protections around the MRNA vaccines."
7193,I agree but remember Israel had a lockdown just like the UK so there caseload is much lower.
7194,They will have much fewer breakthrough cases than the US.
7195,[removed]
7196,Massholes will be heading home quickly.
7197,"Conversely, not everyone that doesn't die from COVID is ""ok"""
7198,"I can’t go out of my way to protect the elderly - who lived their life already- for a year 
It’s not even fda approved yet
I will re evaluate when the phase 3 trials are completed."
7199,"Until then, if you are scared or a high risk person, you should stay away and let everyone else live on and get herd immunity"
7200,It depends on what the R value of the UK variant is if no masking.
7201,Measles is not contained by 75% vaccination (for a vaccine that gives almost 100% sterilizing immunity).
7202,It’s definitely possible.
7203,It’s also possible cases will be so low in a year that we won’t need a booster.
7204,My main concern is the availability.
7205,Is it gonna be another shit show with getting your booster or will it be as available as the flu shot by then?
7206,"Gotcha, I understand now, and agree."
7207,"no, why waste money doing that when re-vaccinating everyone is easier?"
7208,"Question for the people who got the J&amp;J vaccine, 

How confident are you about somewhat going back to normal (obviously follow the rules), and less stressed about Covid?"
7209,Does the lower efficacy rate cross your mind?
7210,Do you feel like it’s over for Covid for you?
7211,"The reason I’m asking is because I’m fully vaccinated with J&amp;J, but we’re having a surge in my state, and I have been extremely careful this whole."
7212,"I am actually not a high risk, but for some reason I feel like I can’t really shake off the anxiety about catching Covid and end up with some long term effects.. also the lower efficacy rate is in the back of my mind.. are my fears ridiculous?"
7213,"I just want to see how everyone is approaching this, I think I just need little encouragement lol."
7214,"Here you go, since apparently you can’t use google:

https://fox8.com/news/pfizer-ceo-says-individuals-will-likely-need-third-dose-within-a-year-then-annual-vaccines/"
7215,Yeah but people aren't going to try and force social distancing and masking because if the flu shot.
7216,"Okay, thanks."
7217,"Honestly though who cares if you get covid after vaccination as long as you’re not going to get hospitalized on a vent, have long term affects, or die."
7218,That’s what I thought the point was.
7219,So you’re safe from the WORST outcomes.
7220,I don’t care if I get sick for a few days as long as I’m not dead or permanently damaged from it!
7221,haha.... sending the fire trucks to a different neighborhood fire after they've already arrived at the scene in your neighborhood
7222,People taking a hard stance against a situation that doesn't exist yet by weighing it against a situation that doesn't exist yet
7223,"It's also that, of course."
7224,"But if everyone is offered a vaccine and it protects them from serious illness, we might be a bit easier with that."
7225,If it was %80 protection against severe illness instead of ~%100 I would agree more.

7231,*
7232,This was me basically.
7233,I don't have insurance at the moment and when I signed up for the vaccine it said to bring ID and insurance.
7234,"It didn't say anything about insurance not being necessary but I was pretty sure that if I showed up they'd still stick me, especially since my local area is struggling to find arms."
7235,"When I showed up to my appointment and told the pharmacist I didn't have insurance I could tell that he wasn't used to hearing that because he had to pull out a reference sheet that told him how to handle that, but other than adding a few minutes of me standing there, it wasn't an issue."
7236,I wish that would have been more clear on the website though.
7237,I have this issue too and I’ve been unable to stop taking birth control.
7238,"I’ve tried, and my life is miserable without it."
7239,"As someone in my early 20s with both doses of Pfizer, from the UK, don’t be an asshole"
7240,&gt; They should start by enlisting leaders in the communities most resistant.
7241,"From personal experience, this means non-English speaking ones."
7242,I have to fight off garbage Spanish-language youtube junk every day.
7243,"Locally for me, Chicago-area, there's medium-level pushes from the news channels to help but I doubt that is happening for the rest of the state."
7244,I can only guess similar is happening in other non-English language groups.
7245,"There's a lot of people trying to fight against bad info in English, as it's the world's most common language, but not as much fight against junk in other communities...especially ones that already distrust authority for other reasons."
7246,[removed]
7247,"Exactly, it's a really offensive headline!"
7248,"People, not just women, are comparing the risks of lots of things to get some perspective on it all, plus it's opened up a dialogue about the risks of the pill."
7249,It's not like women are missing the nuances or something like it implies.
7250,For older people who have a higher risk the benefits outweigh the risks.
7251,But most of those have been vaccinated in Denmark.
7252,Just for the record ... I’m not advocating for ignoring Fauci just for the sake of it.
7253,"I’m saying that his extremely conservative approach is no longer realistic, is no longer data driven, and is arguably contradicting of what his &amp; other epidemiologist’s roadmap for a return to normal had us doing at this time."
7254,We have evidence to suggest vaccinated people do not spread covid.
7255,We have evidence to suggest covid variants to not affect the vaccines ability to prevent severe disease.
7256,The extremely conservative approach is overkill at this point.
7257,Loving that 69.420 getting closer and closer
7258,What does this have to do with anti vaxxers?
7259,"Ive been relatively careful, got infected 3 weeks ago but also got my first shot this week."
7260,I’ll say it the fact that we shut down the entire world for this is kinda asinine
7261,I work for a primary care and the only time we receive the vaccine charts is if a patient provides our name/info  to the pharmacy and then we receive it from the pharmacy.
7262,Never once have we received one on behalf of insurance.
7263,They mostly collect insurance info to get the small payout it they’re offering for administering the vaccine/using their resources and also for statistical purposes.
7264,Chicago bars were packed and ignoring limits immediately but we know from 13 months of this that those limits are theater.
7265,Limits and distancing inside a bar or restaurant do nothing.
7266,You can't go to a closed room without a mask for long periods and be safe if you're not fully vaccinated.
7267,Re-opening sends the message that it's safe.
7268,Further we want to limit variants.
7269,That means continuing to minimize infections until we hit that vaccination herd immunity.
7270,Of course it should be regional but aggressive reopenings in many states have been mostly to make a different statement than public health.
7271,"Chicago, for instance, isn't fully open to all for vaccination yet."
7272,The rest of the state just opened to people under 65 on April 12th.
7273,I'd bet by May 12th plus 6 weeks we can pretty much go back to normal.
7274,Who goes to bars and restaurants?
7275,People under 65.
7276,The CDC isn't being overly cautious.
7277,"Local elected officials are just in a delicate balancing act between safety and the ""p-word you can't say here"" ramifications of not caving in to people like OP."
7278,"Here's what needs to happen: Explicit messaging that the only way to end mask mandates, restrictions, and social distancing is to get vaccinated."
7279,Period.
7280,No more running around with double masks.
7281,Officials need to make it very clear that they believe the vaccines work.
7282,That will encourage people to get the vaccine.
7283,"And no, coercion is not going to work, either."
7284,"&gt; The disparity is in part because vaccinations were initially offered to healthcare workers and the elderly, groups that are disproportionately composed of women."
7285,"But it also likely reflects longstanding patterns of men engaging in riskier behavior and paying less attention to their health than women, experts say."
7286,"&gt;around 9 staff recently got covid19 despite fully vaccinated with Moderna in Ontario

Ok. THAT is scary."
7287,"Clusters of that size should be VERY unlikely with a 90-95% effective vaccine..

Of course, the vaccine batch could have been bad..."
7288,"I'm angry because ""We're taking blood clots seriously"" is inversely ""Birth Control?"
7289,"We don't give a fuck unless you're fertile""

Ad in a decade of ugly endometriosis pain and ""We won't do a hysterectomy in case you want more children""

This is barely the surface of my opinion of the medical community that I've been unlucky enough to see with luck in the flavor of the loser at russian roulette."
7290,"I'm shot, taking other people for shots -- just really tone deaf to report on blood clots like it's some rare new risk that we super care about NOW."
7291,Belgium is still aiming for July.
7292,They are using AZ for 55+ which should still make it possible.
7293,"If J&amp;J don't deliver any at all, it will be trickier, although Pfizer might pick up some of the slack."
7294,Plus we should also get Curevac before July.
7295,"Agreed, it doesn't sound good."
7296,I got downvoted to hell yesterday for pointing this out when an American said that they should just keep the *good* vaccines for themselves and sell the *bad* ones (J&amp;J) to e.g.
7297,Europe.
7298,"He responded with ""am I an asshole for giving a homeless person my leftovers""... really irked me, vaccine nationalism is distasteful and that was just such a bad analogy."
7299,Thank you.
7300,That link was really informative.
7301,My mother just took first AZ shot.
7302,I know what to look for now and even suggest treatment if side effects of clotting creep in.

7375,"Ah, you mean people being paid to just sit around and not do work."
7376,Yeah I agree there's definitely a subset of people who are having a cushy experience at home and don't want to go back in-person for that reason.
7377,Profit incentive will cause businesses to slowly stop doing that over time though
7378,[removed]
7379,This happened in Peru.
7380,How bad was the reaction?
7381,If it’s extremely bad you should have contacted a doctor because the scheme is basically a feedback submit thing.
7382,Absolutely.
7383,Today's variants aren't much of a danger to vaccinated people; it's tomorrow's variant-of-a-variant that'll be trouble.
7384,"Get a variant now while it's 10% different from what you're immune to, not 20% or 30% or however deep that rabbit hole can go."
7385,"Excerpt: 

&gt; A man took his adult children to receive COVID-19 vaccinations over the weekend, knowing it was important for them to be immunized against the disease."
7386,"&gt; But he didn’t feel concerned about his own risk of catching the virus, despite the fact that older people and men are more likely to die from COVID-19, Barbara Ferrer, L.A. County’s public health director, said this week."
7387,He had not made plans to get vaccinated.
7388,"&gt; “I was worried about him, and so were his children,” said Ferrer, who encountered the family at a Los Angeles vaccination site."
7389,"“What’s staggering to realize is that the very group of folks who have the higher mortality rate are now also the group of folks that have the lower vaccination rates.”



&gt; Throughout the pandemic, men worldwide have been far more likely to die from COVID-19 — because of a mix of biological and behavioral factors — but also less likely to have been vaccinated against the disease."
7390,"&gt; The data from L.A. County paints a troubling picture: Here, 153 of every 100,000 women have died from COVID-19, while 289 of every 100,000 men have."
7391,"&gt; But while 44% of women in L.A. County have received at least one dose of a vaccine, only 30% of men have."
7392,"&gt; And in the 38 states that have published a gender breakdown of vaccination rates, more women have been vaccinated than men in all of them, according to Kaiser Health News."
7393,U could poke me with just about any shot and I faint.
7394,"Tattoos, I faint, piercings I faint, cut myself to bad, faint."
7395,It sucks.
7396,"The truth is, it was my first time to read from an expert from English speaking country clearly pointing out the 50% was for entire range of clinical symptoms."
7397,Pfizer even didn’t publish that data.
7398,Some suspected it would be less than 50%.
7399,You’re... I’ll be nice... you’re not thinking about this accurately either
7400,"I mean, that's pretty good number for you guys considering the country size with a population near 330M people."
7401,"Clearly, it would be better if those 7M people could be communicated with better but it still seems a pretty reasonable number given the logistics."
7402,Japan didn't have an election to rig.
7403,"Naturally, Coronavirus is met with appropriate concern over there

It's not fucking real."
7404,It is REAL.
7405,It's this last year's flu variant.
7406,If that.
7407,Why are you letting Fauchi make decisions about your life?
7408,Get a vaccine and go out and live your life.
7409,I registered on my counties website.
7410,It asked which kind of insurance I had but I wasn't able to enter the info for it.
7411,It said the shot was free but my insurance will be charged for the administration of the vaccine.
7412,"I booked my appointment, showed up on the day and tried to hand them my insurance card and they didn't take it."
7413,That was my experience with it.
7414,Watching the mail to see what bill comes.
7415,No one knows if you've been vaxxed or not.
7416,"Welp, it's now gone from a few day pause to at least a 10-day pause that will lead to potentially millions not being able to get vaccinated."
7417,43% of NYC adults have had at least one dose of a COVID vaccine; I'm guessing we're starting to see the impacts on the numbers.
7418,"I asked about that and got told they would have to do it along with a tubal ligation, or something like that."
7419,It’s been a while though so I can’t really remember.
7420,You’re acting like the mRNA vaccines don’t exist.
7421,"As a potential passenger, I would prefer vaccine passports because that's the best way to ensure a safe flight."
7422,"But then some people can't take vaccines, so that's a bit unfair to them."
7423,"Other than those exceptions, people who don't want to get a covid vaccine shouldn't fly."
7424,"Sorry, that was my bad then..."
7425,Ibuprofen has a higher risk profile imo.
7426,...
7427,Well one of the reasons so many here aren't is Virginia's restrictions on who can get it.
7428,"Personally, I’d like 75% but I know that due to children not being able to get it yet and people not getting it, that might not happen."
7429,Even a majority (so like 66%) is still good.
7430,"&gt; I can handle bodily fluids with ease

Should be in your Tinder profile."
7431,Yeah in your specific instance if you live with someone that is immunicomprised then it's definetely important to get the Astra vaccine
7432,They announced that they’re stopping it either May 1st or sometime in May (I forget which).
7433,But I do believe you are right that they have been doing it this whole time.
7434,What’s funny is the EU spent months crying about having no AZ despite not negotiating for it.
7435,They almost indirectly caused domestic terrorism as a result of it (the NI border situation).
7436,And now they won’t use any AZ
7437,or just close your facebook account...
7438,[deleted]
7439,Your experience is opposite of mine.
7440,All my close friends and family have gotten at least one dose.
7441,Nearly half of adults have gotten at least 1 dose with that number being ~37% of the general population.
7442,"I bet we could make it to half of the population even without vaccinating children, and that seems like the biggest limiting factor once we've gotten to that point."
7443,I assume most adults who've been vaccinated will do the same for their kids when possible so I can easily see about 66% of the population getting vaccinated.
7444,"At that point, assuming ebough of that last 33% are covid skeptics who've already been sick, I'm still confident we will see herd immunity in the US very soon."
7445,I'm just a regular guy though.
7446,I like that your version of their dad calls them niddles.
7447,Began showing symptoms after one week or caught it after one week?
7448,Uh... it's not.
7449,"Apparently covid has significantly higher chances, since y'know, pandemic virus."
7450,"Like, hundreds, thousands of more times likely to cause the same blood clots."
7451,"25  here, got stabbed with J&amp;J last week in rural south U.S."
7452,[removed]
7453,Perhaps that is one of the many factors in play.
7454,"With the restrictions, Michigan may have less natural immunity."
7455,It does seem that states with the toughest restrictions are seeing an increase in cases.
7456,"I know it's not completely the reason, but it's one of the many factors in play."
7457,"On the bright side, between the vaccine and your natural antibodies you’re basically super immune once you’re better."
7458,Even more so if you caught one of the strains that emerged after the vaccines were released.
7459,"I have a lifelong fear of needles, about 7 years ago I had to start injecting myself twice a month."
7460,"I went to the doctors office for maybe 6 months every 2 weeks to have them do it, and eventually it was just becoming too inconvenient."
7461,"The first time I injected myself, every fiber of my being was saying “no, do not do this” I did it, finished injecting, and immediately threw up on myself."
7462,"Even to this day, I am not completely fine with giving myself injections"
7463,"For most people, “getting it over with” has nothing to do with the virus but the restrictions they bring."
7464,Nothing makes the restrictions last longer except for politicians saying they will last longe.r
7465,Women make up a large portion of the medical field and live longer so have been disproportionately prioritized early.
7466,We're seeing the gap start to close in places that are further along with vaccinations.

7473,"It seems Hawaii is going to ease restrictions very soon, but their Governor is very stubborn."
7474,They're in the process of discussing allowing vaccinated people to travel there without restriction.
7475,I'd hold out until the bitter end if you can.
7476,I don’t handle needles well either - and I’m a seamstress!
7477,I still got my vaccines though &amp; I did not cry at the 2nd dose!
7478,"Yeah the problem was AZ botched their trials so we had no clue how it worked in old people, until their updated results came out and it became clear that it was effective in old people"
7479,"I can get shots fine, but I pass out easily when having to have blood taken."
7480,I HATE it!!!
7481,!
7482,That was my point lol.
7483,"I was arguing for your side...

Sick of people gaslighting with weird semantic arguments."
7484,"We have to because all the vaccines are emergency approved not like fully fully approved , not that I didn’t get it cuz I did but that’s the situation"

7486,How is this being upvoted lmao.
7487,You're literally saying you're going to try to get sick with a variant?

7502,"This is purely speculation on my part, but I think the fact that it's mostly pre-menopausal women developing clots is very interesting."
7503,"I wouldn't be shocked if there is a link between being on the hormonal birth control pill, which itself can cause an increased risk of blood clots."
7504,"Side note: very interesting to see such a ruckus being raised over the vaccines risk of clots when the hormonal birth control pill has a much higher incidence and sees, in the long run, more widely and prolonged use."
7505,Yet no one kicks up a fuss about that.
7506,"👀

I am definitely not a professional, someone feel free to correct me if I'm wrong about anything here."
7507,I think demand will drop a lot after 170 million first doses.

7511,I think you're just inferring it.
7512,(Disclaimer: most of the article is paywalled)
7513,Yeah this is bizarre.
7514,"You should study if x gives you more blood clots than control, not if you get more blood clots than something completely different."
7515,One of those rare instances where your own stupidity matches advice giving to the public.
7516,Of course it must be very exciting for you.
7517,Gloating is natural.
7518,Didn’t Europe cheap out the deal between manufacturers?

7524,"3,525,204 administered

78,498,290 fully vaccinated (23.6% total pop, 30.3% adults)

34,844,584 above 65 fully vaccinated (63.7%)"
7525,This article made me feel a sense of hopelessness.
7526,"I know the vaccines weren’t 100% and I expected breakthrough cases, but I had unrealistic hopes that were just crushed by reading this article that COVID would go away."
7527,"I understand I was dreaming and overly hopeful, but it really makes me sad that COVID is going to be an issue for the foreseeable future."
7528,I just had a reality check.
7529,The only thing I find interesting is that 74 people died.
7530,I thought the vaccine prevented deaths and hospitalizations by 100%?
7531,Incredible achievement.
7532,I think 90% in that group should be our ultimate goal.
7533,It will be tough but I think it is possible with a concerted focus around the country.
7534,General public has zero fucking clue what peer reviewed means.
7535,That shits blew out the window years ago.
7536,Atleast I’m not a wussy
7537,Im interested to see how high we can get.
7538,The US has been hording Astrazeneca vaccines equal to three times the population of Belgium and only shipped out a tiny bit of them when pressured (to Mexico and Canada).
7539,Astrazeneca is not even FDA approved yet so currently unusable in the US.
7540,"Meanwhile Europe is still shipping vaccines all over the world because guess what, one country finishing first with their vaccination will do jack shit to this virus going away, you have the vaccinate the *entire* world population."
7541,Which is why I say it's only a matter of time before getting it.
7542,"You'll better be vaccinated the day you'll get it...  
Also, why the down votes?"
7543,"Yes, if you're going up into the mountains, definitely stick to Mt."

7545,No other interesting areas up there.
7546,"Nope, just Mt."
7547,Washington.
7548,You tourists feel free to leave the other trails to the locals...
7549,There is a difference between critical and uncritical skepticism.
7550,This is a really good point.
7551,I think it would be interesting to study how effective it is to give a Pfizer booster shot to someone who was initially vaccinated with Moderna and vice versa.
7552,😬😬😬 Its already almost as bad as it used to be.
7553,I do not look forward to having drunk and obnoxious tourists trying to enter my apartment building again thinking it's their hotel.
7554,I've only had that happen once in the past year.

7577,I got vaccinated to do my part in helping humanity as a whole rather than out of fear of catching COVID-19.
7578,So then it’s a wash. Doctors learn how to treat it among recently vaccinated individuals and we move on with vaccinations.
7579,Win/win.
7580,You are MOST CERTAINLY right.
7581,What about other complications that are more frequent with the other vaccines?
7582,Deaths not related to the blood clot?
7583,I think there are more deaths due to other even unknown causes from the vaccine.
7584,We might want to ask why this story is making big news in the first place.
7585,Something is fatally wrong in how particular news gets out and more critical news is not.
7586,"In a country where you can dine out, go to nightclubs and do pretty much everything “normal” a outside mask mandate does not do anything."

7608,I got my second dose about a month and a half ago.
7609,I’ve been following along for updates on how the US and other countries’ vaccination campaign because my lizard brain likes seeing numbers go up.

7627,At some point we're gonna start to see the number of first doses decrease as various states and counties reach the point where demand &lt; supply.
7628,she's *taking a shot* though
7629,It is counting the number of incidents and comparing them.
7630,It isnt hard to do.
7631,So much of it is going to depend on how many people refuse to be vaccinated.
7632,"If enough people refuse, the virus is still able to spread and mutate and we will likely need to get boosters, similar to getting annual flu shots."
7633,Totally expected yearly boosters early on in the pandemic.
7634,"As someone who received Pfizer's vaccine in the trial back in September, guess I'll look forward to getting the third booster this September."
7635,"The number of people in ICU increasing from 1 to 2 people would be ""worsening"" a 100% daily increase and so on."

7642,So true what you said about polio and morbidity and mortality.
7643,"Antivaxxers always refer to the graph of deaths caused by polio, where you can see that the death rate was already decreased when the vaccine was first introduced."
7644,"This is so annoying, because as that might be true they leave out all the crippled and disabled kids that polio caused."
7645,Has all the data linking J&amp;J to blood clots been peer reviewed?
7646,"""This is breaking news."
7647,"Please check back for updates."""
7648,It's not unusual for breaking news to be vague.
7649,I think it's more about full protection from variants.
7650,It's really good against variants so far.
7651,"&gt;Yeah, I'll still wear one in stores and other public indoor places for two reasons

I wish I had that choice lmao."
7652,"I frankly don't care if people are uncomfortable, I have every right to not wear a mask as a fully vaxxed person."
7653,"I know it sounds like ""evil"" pharma-bro stuff to do, but I think the indemnification Pfizer wants is critical."
7654,"With all the hysteria around AZ and now J&amp;J, imagine if these companies would have to be embroiled in litigation over often spurious claims of harm."
7655,"IMO if a government wants to be serious about mass vaccination, they need to get some skin in the game and cover any liability within reason (exceptions for gross negligence of course)."
7656,[removed]
7657,No where near the level of mass hysteria over covid.
7658,The safety of having normal social interaction with other fully vaccinated people should be strongly emphasized.
7659,"I've seen it mentioned occasionally, but it's a big one."
7660,80% of Americans over 65 have received at least one dose.
7661,"I don't think we're going to crack 90%, I'd find it very surprising, but I think we're in a fantastic spot for that population."
7662,"I expect that deaths from them are going to approach irrelevancy very shortly, which is just amazing to say considering Americans over 65 contributed to around 80% of American deaths."
7663,"We're in a great position right now, I'm very optimistic."
7664,Another nice milestone is that 30% of American adults are *fully* vaccinated.
7665,I expect it to be one in three before the end of the week.
7666,"We're also at a seven day deaths average of 764, and I predict that it will continue to decline due to the most vulnerable members of the population nearing a ""completed"" vaccination effort."
7667,I think that soon we're going to reach the lowest it's been since the first wave.
7668,"That number would be a seven day average of 547, which happened on July 7."
7669,"Obviously hundreds of people dying every day isn't *good,* but I think it will be very uplifting for the vaccination effort to put us in a position where less people are dying of this than before it all began."
7670,It's a bit of a psychological victory and I'm excited about it.
7671,"I think 200,000,000 doses will have been administered tomorrow."
7672,"I know Biden has a goal of 200,000,000 doses in one hundred days, but I'm not totally clear on how many doses were administered under Trump."
7673,"Either way being the first country to reach 200,000,000 doses is just absolutely fantastic."

7675,"Sure, there will be hold outs but they'll become the minority."

7682,"Man, you're just all over this thread spreading this shit aren't you?"
7683,"Because of many factors and some bad luck with manufacturing yields, can't put all the blame on the US, not even most of the blame."
7684,[removed]
7685,Am I incapable of reading or is that quote not in the article.
7686,"The quote from him says:

&gt; So I think for planning purposes, planning purposes only, I think we should expect that we may have to boost."
7687,That seems very different from the headline...
7688,The CDC gave guidance back in July that gloves were not necessary.
7689,Ditch 'em!
7690,"I guess you could say this, but the root of the problem is that the vast majority of people are going to listen to their family over their teachers."
7691,"Even in places where everyone learns about evolution in school, people with creationist parents grow up to be creationists (in general)."
7692,"Likewise, for the most part, peoples’ religious views match those of their parents and peoples’ political views match those of their parents."
7693,This is true even among very educated people.
7694,"It is’t a problem that is easily solved with schooling alone, but also schooling is the only way to correct it, so we have to try."
7695,To me this very obviously looks like covering for AZ.
7696,Lotta money tied up in the industry right now.
7697,I am sure some big players are getting upset their ez cash cow darling isn't the perfect investment.
7698,They've said at least six months because that's all the data they have since it's been six months since the first people were vaccinated.
7699,"It will likely last longer, but not forever."
7700,"This is possibly the most useless, vague article I've seen recently."
7701,"What is the actual full, unedited quote from the CEO?"
7702,Why do I have a feeling that CNBC is embellishing this?
7703,Why are people pretending that blood clots are the only bad thing a covid infection can lead to?
7704,Just got my second dose!!!!!
7705,!
7706,"""epidemiology is an ineffective vaccine magically starts working even though it just masks symptoms"""
7707,"It's fine to look at something a CEO says and be skeptical, but if the evidence bears it out then what else are you going to be waiting on?"
7708,Nah.
7709,I’ve got a blood disorder that leads to clots and doctors said I’d be fine to take any of them.
7710,I think unless you’re specifically told you are susceptible to clots it’s fine.
7711,But it never hurts to call your doctor and check if you’re concerned :)
7712,"Canada took the doses we got from COVAX which I think is fair, but we should also have given way more money to COVAX"
7713,"Curious, could a 3rd dose alone be able to protect against multiple, divergent variants?"
7714,"For example, if there are certain strains that have one set of mutations that cause immune and vaccine evasion (E484K variants plus any hypothetical future mutations), but there are other strains that are different from those strains and the original ones that have different set of mutations (E484Q, L452R, and any other hypothetical future mutations), would a 3rd dose mrna dose cover all of that?"
7715,"Realistically it is vaccine vs COVID...this pandemic will never really be over until we reach herd immunity, and the only way there is for a very large majority of the population to either be vaccinated or infected."
7716,"So I guess you can say I’ll hunker down, but for most people that’s not the best or a viable option - we are after all a service based economy and interacting with others is a huge part of most of our jobs."
7717,"What we should do is say, risk of certain syndrome in general population vs vaccination vs COVID."
7718,What’s crazy is people don’t realize greater than 1 in 1000 people have thrombosis/DVT/PE (blood clots) each year in the general population!
7719,We’re going to expect at least that relative rate in any vaccinated group...
7720,Yeah that doesn't make any sense.
7721,Maybe there was some outside factor or something?
7722,I feel like something like this would have been spotted in the trials.
7723,"What, does the virus choose where to spread based on population and if they have mask mandates or not?"
7724,"""Oooh Iowa dropped their mask mandate we can spread here more...Oh wait they're too low of a population never mind"""
7725,"&gt; Link flair ATM is Canada

Oh, I'll fix it."
7726,I'm on the case!
7727,You're doing it wrong.
7728,Sucks to suck.
7729,"Youre  assigning risk and hypothesis as though they are the same, which they are not."
7730,"Youre logic asserts:

There is no risk of a world was 3 occuring because it hasnt happened and is not falsifiable to say there is."
7731,"Aliens havent visited and since you cant prove they exist until they do, the risk of that happening is literally 0."
7732,"I face no risk of loss if I bet against the Bengals winning the superbowl, because ""the bengals could do it someday"" is not falsifiable, as we have never witnessed it and I cannot say there is a chance."
7733,"Youre completly right, those are claims that make a valid hypothesis."
7734,You can look for evidence to prove them wrong.
7735,They are also completely wrong.
7736,That a claim fits the framework of the scientific method does not mean that it is reasonable to use in a statistical setting.
7737,"The fact that your falsifiable claim *can* be proved wrong means that by definition, there is risk."
7738,"You would need to manage to prove your claims for that risk to to away, and the fact thay a few women got it does not prove that men cannot get it."
7739,"The fact that youre asserting that ""men cannot get clora from covid"" requires the scientific process implies that there is still a risk factor for men."
7740,"Your hypothesis is also built on assumptions and limited information, its questionable to begin with."
7741,"The less information, cases, studies, test, the less confidence you can speak of regarding risk."
7742,To say a risk is zero is a pretty damn weighty claim.
7743,"What I said is that the risk is not at all zero, because whether you like it or not, we can look at circumstances, precedent, similar cases, and say things like 'we cannot immediately count out that something almost genetically identical to a human woman will not get this yet, so we should look into it deeper before we say for sure."
7744,Its not exactly uncommon for things that happen to women to happen to men.
7745,"The CDC can raise confidence in a vaccine people are massively skeptical about by making sure they do not kill people because a redditor was not happy enough with their logic""."
7746,Think about the common sense behind what you are saying before jumping to a hypothesis test.
7747,"All of this to say, ""there is zero risk to men because only a few women have had clots so far"" is scientifically laughable."
7748,Yeah I do understand how pharmaceuticals work.
7749,And yes the do have side effects.
7750,"And yes you have a choice in refusing treatment, but that’s less to do with pharmaceuticals, it’s a pillar of medical practise."
7751,"No one was forcing AZ upon you, that’s the vaccine that was available, you have a right to refuse the vaccine (I believe it’s stupid to do so in a country lagging so behind, the benefit outweighs the risk and many experts agree likewise) and you can and did."
7752,You don’t have a right to demand your choice in brand.
7753,I say this being vaccinated twice with Pfizer.
7754,I think some of it is also language and they don’t know it’s free.
7755,These students would do well to listen to their wise canid leaders.

7763,The re review is because people were still getting the vaccine even yesterday.
7764,There will be more data in a week.
7765,"Read the page, it is the 

&gt;**Increase** in the share of the population aged 65 years or over between 2009 and 2019"
7766,OP could put a link to the [percentage point wiki article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point) in the notes section.
7767,"It's good for people to learn statistics concepts, since situations like this often show up in daily life."
7768,"Sorry, but saying risk is just 6 in 7 million is not correct because obviously risks are higher for certain group of people."
7769,You cant pretend difference in risks dont exist and group everyone together.
7770,Thats like saying breast cancer isnt such huge problem in general because for men the lifetime risk of being diagnosed with breast cancer is about 1 in 833 and women have 1 in 8 chance.
7771,That means in general population risk of being diagnosed with breast cancer is around 1:420.
7772,"Doesnt sound so horrible like 1:8, does it."
7773,Or another example.
7774,"Overall chances of child having down syndrome is 1:700, but differences are huge when we compare women in their early 20s with women in their late 30s."
7775,"Do you think it would be fair to just say ""oh, dont worry, risk is 1:700 for all women"", when chances for 20year old woman is 1:1450 and for 40year old woman is 1:85?"
7776,"You cant ignore differences in sex, age and race."
7777,"That doesnt mean we shouldnt investigate how something affects men, but we cant group everyone together and say ""yeah, thats the risk""."
7778,You might be taking a higher chance of unwillingly dying by not taking the vaccine.
7779,Humans are bad at balancing active risks Vs passive risk.
7780,Nope.
7781,Too many vaccinations have been done for this to happen on this scale.
7782,There will be tons of small town outbreaks amongst the unvaccinated this summer but no huge state wide surges on this scale.
7783,"""Members of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices said they didn't have enough information to recommend changes, or even to suggest extending a pause in administering the vaccine."""
7784,Slow clap.
7785,You are nailing this guys....
7786,"Sure, but the priority groups weren't (and probably shouldn't be) specific enough to account for that."
7787,"I think group 1A basically everywhere was just medical professionals and LTC facility workers and residents, all of which definitely slants female."
7788,"Even when 1B was added (65 or 75+), you've still got a solid slant towards women."
7789,"The age groups were an attempt (and a fairly good one) at targeting the people who were most at risk, but it isn't perfect."
7790,"Even if you vaccinated 100% of people over 65 you'd still have quite a few more women, although I don't know the actual split."
7791,"It's likely that personal choices are also playing into this to a degree, but it isn't as big a factor as it might appear at first."
7792,"I did not contradict myself, most countries having ineffective lockdowns that were still much easier on the economy than nothing at all does not mean lockdowns are bad, it means most countries have incompetent poor leadership that buckles too much to idiotic pressure."
7793,"Just to reiterate, having no lockdown at all has always been much harder on any economy when there's Covid about (there's a year of clear evidence of that) and you're saying that government incompetence means the proven-to-be-right strategy isn't so."
7794,At no point in time did I or anyone else claim that much of the world did not lockdown properly.
7795,You were just now pretending that I claimed the world locked down properly.
7796,Yet despite that the countries that locked down more effectively **somehow** all have had better economic outcomes.
7797,I see a lot of people saying that there’s nothing wrong with vaccine passports and I get where they’re coming from but the people complaining are largely not talking about having to get it for school or work but they’re talking about the idea of having some app with a QR that you scan to go into the grocery store and if you don’t have it then you have to wear a mask or do distancing stuff and that’s the kind of thing i get not wanting.
7798,It’s also good to keep in mind that that’s likely not going to happen.
7799,Well it may mean more vaccines for us so I’m happy.

7852,"They only just started their infant trial, so that's probably 6 months out, but they are trialing 6 months to 12 years, which, assuming the child tests go as the adults do, means we'd have coverage for essentially everyone."
7853,Babies would get their first set of vaccinations and have COVID as part of it.

7919,she was hospitalized for 3 days but thankfully is okay.
7920,She was at one of the best hospitals in the US and the cardiologists/infectious disease doctors said that it was almost certainly the result of an immune reaction to the vaccine.

7935,Anything above 70 is an absolute no.
7936,I honestly haven't been following the UK.
7937,That said Israeli HMOs have reported 90+% efficacy with millions vaccinated.
7938,Basically echoing what Pfizer and Moderna have observed for the last 6 months.
7939,"So you're either telling me that Pfizer does worse in the UK than all these numbers indicate, or you're telling me that AZ has done just as well."
7940,"Either way, Israel is reporting at about 200 cases a day now for a country of 9 million."

7946,Give me a rational reason why fully vaccinated individuals should continue to wear a mask?
7947,If it's merely to keep up appearances I don't buy that.
7948,If I don't pose a threat to others and I'm protected it is not my problem.
7949,"Nope, they lumped Moderna test with Pfizer."
7950,Pfizer was tested after 7 days
7951,"The thing is, we're focusing on the idea that we want to stop all spread period."
7952,That isn't the plan.
7953,"if 40% of the population of a region is vaccinated, that's 2 of every 5 patrons that can not pass or contract the virus, lowering the likelihood that covid will spread in a closed space (and yes, we have evidence now to suggest that vaccinated persons do not spread covid)."
7954,&gt; Further we want to limit variants.
7955,That means continuing to minimize infections until we hit that vaccination herd immunity.
7956,"I'm not trying to come off as argumentative, but this sounds a lot like *We don't know if vaccines, even though effective, will actually prevent spread*."
7957,It just seems more like yet another reason why we should continue to put life on hold indefinitely.
7958,"As of now, we have no evidence to suggest that any future variant will negate the vaccine's ability to keep people out of hospital, which is the goal of all of this."

7976,"Nope, 2 weeks: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/second-shot.html"
7977,How can you say it's absolutely false and then contradict yourself by acknowledging that some countries didn't have effective lockdown procedures.
7978,Your no true Scotsman approach to lockdowns doesn't invalidate the reality that the majority of the world had the bad kind of lockdown to which your initial argument does not apply.
7979,They really put a blind eye on this issue.
7980,"🤦‍♂️I'm still thinking it's too early for the Olympics to happen, should've postpone it to 2022"
7981,Hive mentality and people parroting false information is common on Reddit unfortunately.
7982,As a fun fact Canada is actually giving more 1st doses per capita than the US is right now.
7983,Though that is partially because Canada did choose to delay the second doses.
7984,However with studies such as with Astra Zeneca being more effective with longer time between doses it'll be interesting to see if that affects things later in the summer.
7985,"To add to this, DOH is a great resource in general if you’re uninsured."
7986,"Some definitely go further than others, but they will at least vaccinate you and keep you stitched up to the best of their ability."
7987,"Your comment about offering vaccines- I read it as vaccinating for hep a and b and hiv, which made me google hiv vaccine?!"
7988,"And turns out, 2 days ago, they determined a novel hiv vaccine is safe and effective... so wow!"
7989,That’s awesome.
7990,Get hep c and we’ll be on a roll.
7991,He’s not wrong LOL and I’m from Europe
7992,CONGRATS!!
7993,!
7994,Just finished up my second Moderna shot.
7995,Lets keep it going.
7996,"Sure, the gap may not ever close fully, but it won't remain this disparate for long either."
7997,"If the EU is now where the US was 7 weeks ago, but the rate of vaccination/deliveries is quickly increasing (it is) it can still be that the EU is where the US is now, in 4 weeks time."
7998,Future weeks and past weeks are different and “behind” is ambiguous to which ones is referred to.
7999,It's still effective against severe disease and death which is what we're trying to prevent.
8000,my roommate just got covid :(.
8001,"Thankfully I got my vaccine, but only 1 week ago (J&amp;J) How worried should I be?"
8002,Should I avoid home as much as possible?
8003,Keep all the windows open?
8004,"Well, if it wasn't for the clots I don't think AZ and J&amp;J would have any significant problems."
8005,AFAIK in the UK AZ and Pfizer performed on the same level.
8006,I only wore mine outdoors if I was in a relatively crowded area like a parking lot.
8007,"Walking down the sidewalk where I only passed a person every ten minutes, hell no."
8008,&gt; A much more reasonable response would have been to send out a press release saying tell those who administer the vaccine to look out for particular symptoms in particular demographic groups because of a very rare but serious potential side effect while more data is gathered.
8009,This would do much more long term damage when people find out the CDC already knew about complications and didn’t inform the public.
8010,The pause is not good news but it’s the best thing they could’ve done.
8011,So I'm in the nursing program and in pharm class I learned about how even otc meds that we take without thinking about it has a *shit* ton of possible side effects.
8012,"Ibuprofen can cause heart failure, heart attacks, GI bleeding, hepatitis, and Steven Johnson syndrome."
8013,These are all life threatening complications but we still take them regularly.
8014,I'm freaking out too after 2 days after my vaccine but at the same time I recognize that it's a *very* small risk and there's no vaccine or medication ever that can't mess you up bad if you're particularly unlucky.
8015,"IMO it's good that these issues are being brought to light, but the media is doing it's same bs again where ""we're all gonna die and you should be very afraid right now so keep reading our articles to stay informed""."
8016,"They're not all like this obviously, but I mean shit, I just read an article about how a healthy 25 year old died 3 months after getting the vaccine."
8017,"Funnily enough, they never actually said that it was from the covid vaccine but act as if healthy young people never die."
8018,Though they didn't start AZ until some time in February.
8019,Dec 27th was the start for Pfizer-BioNTech.
8020,"On e they figure out who is susceptible to clots with Oxford and JnJ, just give them the Pfizer or moderna vaccine."
8021,Anyone with no chance of blood clots can easily take the AstraZeneca vaccine.
8022,Let’s give the scientists and researchers a little more time.
8023,They have done amazing work so far and they can even address this issue.
8024,I am very hopeful of a positive outcome.
8025,Should be.
8026,"The term ""booster"" is a little bit confusing because it's really a completely independent vaccine, similar to how you get a different flu shot each year."
8027,Incidentally there's a whole bunch of different companies that make flu shots with different processes and there doesn't seem to be any need to stick with one company.
8028,"pfft, it's only one nitrogen atom."
8029,can't possibly make a difference.
8030,now where's my H2O2?
8031,It's a ridiculous argument and smells of PR.
8032,"But it's only 10% per year until you get a different vaccine, and possibly much lower depending on the progress of the vaccination campaign (but could also be quite higher of we don't reach herd immunity but vaccinate enough people to remain open with healthcare saturation - in which case the spread in the non vaccinated population might end up higher)"
8033,"Anytime there are two things, you have to do one of them."
8034,The people talking about breaking the patents are seriously missing the boat.
8035,The patents are the reason we got all these for-profit companies to race for the vaccine in the first place.
8036,Playing Lucy and the Football is a short-sighted strategy that will screw us when the next pandemic happens.
8037,"And the people talking about the ""research"" being publicly funded are totally missing the boat."
8038,How about the years of expertise companies like Moderna have acquired with mRNA vaccines?
8039,"That wasn't ""publicly funded""

I don't want the Government attempting to make vaccines itself for the next pandemic."
8040,That sounds like a nightmare scenario.
8041,"Put aside your concerns about ""fairness"" for a second, and take a look at the process of trying to create a vaccine for a pandemic disease:

1."
8042,"The government tries to create the vaccine itself with its own money, and then gives it to the public for free."
8043,2.
8044,The government lets private companies make the vaccine and negotiates a price with them that the Government will pay.
8045,"Given the urgency of the situation, the Government may also choose to subsidize this vaccine development, production and testing in order to get the vaccine out quicker."
8046,3.
8047,"The government does the same thing as 2, and leaves private companies under the impression that profit will happen, but then expropriates the IP after the vaccine turns out to be useful."
8048,"Now, no one will ever trust the Government in any future pandemics, and IP rights will be strongly weakened in general, leaving the Government with 1 as the only option."
8049,"Given the behavior of the Government so far during this pandemic, (1) is clearly NOT a good option."
8050,"The Government has consistently underestimated the time it is possible to have a vaccine in, and this would likely be a self-fulfilling prophecy if they decided to try to create a vaccine themselves."
8051,"Government scientists and ""public health experts"" consistently cast doubt on the mRNA technology and likely would've chosen a different tech if they created the vaccine themselves."
8052,Government has been mostly a total disaster when urgency is needed.
8053,No thank you.
8054,"(2) is clearly a better option than (1), will clearly save more lives and get the economy back up and running, so why do people want to try the disingenuous (3) which will inevitably lead to (1) being the only option in the future."
8055,Of course these companies should make a profit.
8056,"They should make a much bigger profit lol, the Government should've offered massive prizes to companies who quickly made an effective vaccine."
8057,The small price the Government has to pay for vaccines is minuscule compared to the massive economic benefits from a vaccinated population.
8058,"""The Government funded it"" is no justification for ""there should be no profit"" unless someone actually believes the Government would be able to make the vaccine itself."
8059,There are masks that don't do that king
8060,Only time I ever notice my tinnitus is when I’m going to sleep.
8061,Have to fall asleep with rain sounds or something similar playing.
8062,But I probably sleep better with that than complete silence anyway.
8063,"In Canada, it's starting to become ""not take the AZ vaccine (or J&amp;J when we receive it) and not get any vaccine at all"", as most vaccines entering the country are AZ."
8064,I believe the point is that 14 isn’t a magic number.
8065,"For some people it might be a little longer, for some people a little less perhaps."
8066,It’s not like 100% of people have immune systems which go “hey!
8067,"It’s 14 days we’re 96% safe now!”

There is some variability there, which means over a massive sample size of tens of millions of vaccinations you’re going to have some people who take a little longer for the “full” immunity to develop"
8068,Which is exactly what the CDC says you shouldn't do.
8069,Restaurants and gyms are still high risk.
8070,"Hanging out with friends, inside, without masks is still high risk."
8071,"The CDC is still recommending you wear a mask, keep 6 feet apart, and limit your time in indoor spaces."
8072,"One thing we don't know yet is do the people who get infected after being vaccinated get long covid or the organ damage they are finding with non-vaccinated, asymptomatic people."
8073,It's not a risk I'm willing to take.
8074,[deleted]
8075,"Thank you, this is great!"
8076,"They don't necessarily need them, they just use them because they're still safe, and used as a preservative."
8077,But lots of people have become hesitant because of misinformation over the years.
8078,So without them should calm their nerves.
8079,Hyperbole.

8092,"Oxford's research was publicly funded because, get this, it's a public research institution."

8100,"Granted I haven’t seen a whole lot on this from either of them, but the little that I have seen that is relatively recent comparing the two implies that the t-cell response is similar."

8105,Exactly so to compare apples to apples you should look at the cases during the same period of this article for those unvaccinated.
8106,"let’s say that is (example purposes only) 120,000 cases for 220M unvaccinated people."
8107,"And then take the reciprocal of  (5800/77M / 120,000/220m) which is 14%

Meaning the efficiancy in the real world is 1-0.14 or 86%

8140,Since last week it’s confusing cause now the general practitioners are also vaccinating.
8141,And it depends - as always - on the individual German state.
8142,"Some states are faster, some states are slower."
8143,"In Canada right now, the time in between the first and second shots of Pfizer vaccine has been stretched to 4 months due to supply.."
8144,Well this is promising.

8146,imagine this combined with being vaccinated you are literally invincible.
8147,"&amp;#x200B;

in all seriousness this is amazing news."
8148,i cannot wait for this to get approved and distributed worldwide.
8149,i see it being possible.
8150,&gt;It may be something closer to like a 30-40% lifetime risk of infection depending how the pandemic plays out and how old you are.
8151,This seems insanely optimistic to me.
8152,"We have flu vaccines and 5-20% of people catch the flu every year, with vaccines reducing your chances of catching it by 40-60%."
8153,"The covid vaccines are more effective which reduces community spread, but covid is also vastly more infectious to begin with."
8154,So why do normal vaccines need metals in them?
8155,He was how the the antibodies from the vaccine would outcompete the body's innate immune response when a common cold occurs and that would make it tougher for the body to fight normal viruses.
8156,I don't know if there's validity to that.
8157,&gt;The ingredients in both the mRNA shots are some of the safest we've ever used.

8166,"Asking someone to take on a 30x increase in risk for their own benefit is selfish, not the other way around and is why most countries have implemented alternative vaccines for women under the age of 30 as the risk/benefit was not in their favor unlike every other demographic group."

8172,It does not.

8251,"I wouldn't normally go to the hospital for a 102F fever unless it was sustained... vaccine side effects should go away within 24-48 hours, so I'd give it that long unless he's in serious pain or discomfort."

8261,"The cdc guidelines say that as a vaccinated person, you can only gather with up to 1 household of unvaccinated people."
8262,It doesn't seem overly cautious to say that if that's the case then we should probably not be getting rid of mask mandates in public yet.
8263,"As time goes on we get more people vaccinated and masks removed based on how safe it is to mix vaccinated &amp; unvaccinated folks, no?"
8264,There is no scientific evidence for wearing a mask outdoors.
8265,None.
8266,Ziltch.
8267,Nada.
8268,They're counting incidents of clots from Covid infections v the vaccine.
8269,If you are asymptomatic you won't have a clot therefore there is nothing to count?!
8270,!
8271,Can you tell me how you coped?
8272,"Look at my original comment, I wasn't whining about anything."
8273,I was saying exercising outside isn't always feasible where I live.

8275,&gt; I fucking hate my boss.
8276,"I don't even work there and I hate him too, what an asshole."
8277,Please.
8278,My guess is they probably think it's better getting it and having a natural immunity especially since they don't get the flu every year.
8279,But getting the vaccine is really no different to the immunity you get by just getting the flu.
8280,"That being said, it doesn't necessarily keep you from getting a severe case of the flu."
8281,It reduces your chances but you can still get it severely despite the vaccination.
8282,"Also, if you get the flu shot early in the season, by late season the shot you got could be ineffective and you can still get a severe case."
8283,"That being said, they're getting better with the flu shot and having it be more effective to variations so the early season shot is good through the whole season most years."
8284,"Regardless, it's still worth getting in my opinion."
8285,I freaking hate the flu
8286,of covid or with covid?

8288,Yeah I can't find any quote that matches the headlines of these articles.
8289,More about planning for future possibilities with different variants.
8290,That's too light and clunky.
8291,Im thinking of doing some concrete work maybe.
8292,"It does, but vector immunity doesn’t stay consistent, it wanes with time and that’s possibly the reason AZ’s vaccine is more effective with a longer dosing interval."
8293,"J&amp;J might find that providing the booster, say, a year later negates vector immunity issues."
8294,Same.
8295,"My BF made appointments for the two of us, but if it wasn't for him, I probably never would have gotten vaccinated."
8296,"I'm not working, and am young with no health conditions, so I figured it wouldn't be worth the $100+ cost of getting it done (since the tests were supposed to be free and I ended up paying like $120 both times)"
8297,I never got the flu shot or the flu so.
8298,Fear doesn't motivate me.

8303,"And again, the variants will play a key role.”

“It is extremely important to suppress the pool of people that can be susceptible to the virus,” Bourla said."

8307,"You want people to die do you?"""
8308,"every time then tell me who the outrage generator is

Of course nobody ever responds because that would force people to actually think about their opinions and what reasons they hold them for"
8309,You want to criticize it?
8310,Go to your local council meeting or write your politicians but to come on reddit and whine about it  is just fucking lame.
8311,"The idea of a permanent ""COVID zero"" situation was always a pipe dream."
8312,It's a highly contagious brand new virus that has animal reserves.
8313,COVID will be around forever.
8314,But vaccines are going to allow us to mostly ignore it until it's time to get a booster at some point so we can keep antibody levels high and keep herd immunity around.
8315,Lol Pfizer just said another shot is needed in around 12 months .. also if it becomes like a flu shot- you should look up the % of population that actually receives one yearly...it around 45-60% and that’s with certain instructions requiring one and mostly young kids n elderly

8333,Yup.

8337,It’s insane.
8338,"It's less about ""majority"" and more about ""herd immunity."""
8339,But I won't be wearing a mask in any group of folks that I know who are vaccinated.
8340,Partly a cultural difference I think.
8341,UK politicians - and I imagine it’s the same in Germany - have to at least pretend that they’re no more important than other public servants like teachers and nurses.
8342,Special treatment of any kind goes down like a lead balloon.
8343,I think there is also a massive difference in the role the UK PM and German chancellor play in their systems compared with the US president.
8344,"They don’t have anywhere near the same personal power, at least in theory."
8345,"nope, the ceo of pfizer did in fact say that ""“A likely scenario is that there will be likely a need for a third dose, somewhere between six and 12 months and then from there, there will be an annual revaccination, but all of that needs to be confirmed."

8350,"In a given population of COVID infections, you’re either symptomatic or asymptomatic."
8351,"8x’s based off only symptomatic cases would be higher than if it were based off ALL infected, which would include asymptomatic as well."
8352,You’re “infected” either way.
8353,The opposite may also be true.
8354,"The adverse reactions are more common for the second shot, or the first if the person had covid in the past."
8355,If the antibodies are still in the body its reasonable to expect that the third shot would be as bad as the second.
8356,Start shipping to Canada and mexico while we wait for people to remove their heads from their ass.

8363,Serious question: why wouldn't we at least continue to wear masks in some situations?
8364,"Like during flu season on public transit, or having medical professionals always wear them when coming into contact with patients (who might have unknown infections), or even around vulnerable people like grandparents or immune-compromised friends?"
8365,"I get that masks can be uncomfortable but I don't understand why people are angry about the mandates when it really costs nothing to wear one, and as far as I can tell will only benefit our general health if worn appropriately and reasonably."
8366,It's funny what happens when you don't let the virus run wild for political points.
8367,Keep up the good work!
8368,Maybe take a breath and think about it for a second.
8369,Many diseases require booster shots.
8370,There's no reason why this would be any different.
8371,"BUT, ""the whole point"" is that we can keep community spread down to a tiny amount, so that we don't have to worry about it ripping through society once we eliminate all restrictions."
8372,"You get your shot now, so that we can crush the number of cases down to a tiny amount (like in Israel right now), and then go back to normal."
8373,You could possibly require a booster at some point down the line so that we can keep things normal.
8374,"Whether you're sick of it or not, the pandemic continues to be a thing that's happening to us, and vaccine boosters sound like a much better option than possible lockdowns every few years if COVID manages to come raging back."

8378,CDC should suspend administering COVID-19 until they can analyze more data.
8379,That's a common difference between a parliamentary democracy and a presidential one.
8380,Neither the Chancellor of Germany nor the British Prime Minister is voted on directly by the people but by parliament.
8381,"They also have much more limited powers compared to the US President or the French President, not even to mention the Russian President."
8382,"No Executive Orders or stuff like that for Mrs. Merkel, she isn't even the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces."
8383,Chancellor Merkel or Prime Minister Johnson could be removed from office any day if they lose the backing of the majority of members of parliament.
8384,I mean we saw that in the UK a bunch of times in recent years.
8385,"Without there being a general election because he lost the confidence of his party Cameron got replaced by  May, who then herself got replaced by Johnson."
8386,"Has been a while that that happened in Germany, think last time was in the 80s when half way through the term the smaller coalition partner of the Social Democrats the Free Liberals switched and  supported the Christian Democratic candidate, making him Chancellor."
8387,It is also affected by precautions taken and the weather.
8388,"Covid has a ""native"" R0 somewhere in the 2.5-5 range, but wet summer weather cuts that by about 20%."
8389,"Then masking cuts that further, and social distancing some more."
8390,"So if you are taking some precautions, even with only 60% immunity you have the pandemic thin."
8391,"Ah, good to know."
8392,"""You didn't get caught so there's no reason to criticize the restriction"" Great argument there, you're a smart little guy."

&gt;A top expert on the pandemic said on Sunday that Israel may have reached “a sort of herd immunity” and could safely ease further restrictions."
8431,"Eran Segal, a computational biologist at the Weizmann Institute of Science, told Channel 12 that ***with most Israelis immunized, even the reopening of swaths of the economy and gatherings over the Purim and Passover holidays had not contributed to a spike in cases."
8432,***
8433,"For all the information we have in this sub, I’m pretty disappointed in the people who are whining here."
8434,"Yes, it’s inconvenient, yes needles are scary, etc etc etc, but your immune system just won’t be able to protect you on its own after 6 months or so, hence the booster."
8435,Then you have continued immunity provided you are getting vaccinated on schedule.
8436,We are probably all going to have to get this shot yearly at a minimum (just like we should be getting the flu shot).
8437,Be thankful we have vaccines... Epecially since they are effective against these very contagious and dangerous new variants.
8438,My father couldn’t get the shot in time to protect himself this year (age group).
8439,"He likely unknowingly had Covid while he was getting vaccinated, and the only place we can figure he was exposed was on a trip to the hardware store a few days before."
8440,"Tested positive yesterday, and has had a fever and horrible cough for the last 4 days - the fever just won’t budge."
8441,It’s extremely worrying.
8442,"If you are lucky enough to have had your second dose and plan on whining in this thread about having to get a third one in six months, keep your unwanted opinions to yourself."
8443,Isn't that just an extra argument to use Pfizer/BioNTech in the EU?
8444,"Use the expensive vaccines in the rich countries, and the cheap vaccines in the poorer countries."
8445,thats almost guaranteed.

8461,I’d rather have people with enough integrity to admit they were wrong than to keep a harmful course.
8462,This is the dumbest analogy I think I've ever heard.
8463,Get vaccinated.
8464,"I agree with your comment, but I thought I’d mention that the 61% figure for the UK is adults only."
8465,If we’re looking at total population the percentage is currently 48% (compared to 38% on the same metric for the US).
8466,I think at this point it's in the USA's self interest to start releasing its AZ and J&amp;J rights to other countries that want them and/or donate.
8467,"To someone who won't get any vaccine until the fall at the earliest, the 1/1,000,000 odds of getting a dangerous but treatable blood clot is a absurdly low risk, especially if you're over 60+ or high risk for death if you get covid."
8468,"To someone who can probably pick or choose their vaccine in a month, they'll want the mRNA vaccines with less known side effect risks and probably higher efficacy against infection and the variants."
8469,"The biggest long term risk to the USA isn't completing the vaccine campaign, which will move on to persuasion and kids soon, if not imminently."
8470,"Instead, it's that covid will develop a variant that gets into the country before a booster can be safely developed and deployed."
8471,Less covid in the world reduces that risk.
8472,"Or, it's like dominos, if the variant takes over China, South Korea, and Vietnam, it will eventually spread to the rest of the world and threaten America."
8473,"But if the government isn't mandating things like n95's or double masking they clearly aren't actually as concerned about the spread as they make it out to be, it's theater so they won't be criticized."
8474,We have a crime spree in this community.
8475,"We need to double the number of police on every street to protect you, also if you see anyone breaking the rules make sure to report them."

I disagree for a few reasons."
8485,"First, this age demographic tends to be under medical supervision often enough and they will be encouraged one on one by their providers to get vaccinated."
8486,"Second, the numbers indicate that this group is still getting vaccinated at a high rate considering only 20% remain to initiate the process."
8487,"At the current rate, they'll be at 90% in a month."
8488,"Of course it will slow down so I'm not saying that it will be a month, just that there is still a lot of momentum."

8496,"Finally, I think in general there is an unwarranted pessimism about the numbers who will eventually get vaccinated."
8497,We've reached greater than 90% of the population with other vaccines and  hopefully we will with COVID vaccines as well.

8551,Everyone is commenting about the effectiveness after one shot… why are we even bothering with the second shot if that’s true?
8552,See also: https://www.axios.com/pfizer-coronavirus-vaccine-booster-shot-a82ee84a-a5f4-4150-b5aa-7b216d182bd3.html
8553,But she's still a head of state.
8554,I don't see why she can't jump the line without controversy.
8555,"If you want to make conspiracy theories come true and probably help start a civil war, then sure."
8556,*This* is what fucking scares you?
8557,"Not the virus which killed a million people, the vaccine which killed *maybe* one person?"
8558,"I'm sorry, I'm just fucking done with people."
8559,It's just...
8560,I cannot even at this point.
8561,I just got my moderna shot on 4/13.
8562,I called my pharmacist today to schedule my second shot and he said I can come in today (4/15).
8563,Does that seem right?
8564,I thought I’m supposed to wait 28 days before I get my second shot?
8565,Is there new information on this?
8566,The exact number is hard to pin down.
8567,But there are a lot of documented cases about it.
8568,I linked to an article that links to the survey of studies on it.
8569,"And again, that's with the most-risky outdoor activities mostly banned."
8570,"&gt;Again, the goal isn’t zero cases and zero risk."
8571,COVID is endemic and it’s not going anywhere.
8572,Of course?
8573,I never said otherwise.
8574,Although Obviously we expect the community spread of COVID to be a lot lower after enough people are vaccinated.
8575,We'll all be safer just from that alone.
8576,"For comparison, the flu kills between 33 and 167 Americans per day on an annual basis ([source](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html))"
8577,This has been driving me crazy.
8578,"If you see the pause of J&amp;J and your first thought is ""well this isn't going to help our case against anti-vaxxers,"" then your priorities are way off base."
8579,The actual safety of the vaccine is more important than winning an argument against a group that will never accept evidence that doesn't fit their biases.
8580,1.
8581,Young healthy people die and are hospitalized too.
8582,2.
8583,Kids and some people with health conditions can’t get the vaccine and they depend on others to get it.
8584,Anyone who doesn’t get vaccinated puts them at risk.
8585,3.
8586,The more it spreads the greater the chance that it mutates to a form that evades vaccines.
8587,4.
8588,We don’t know the long term effects of Covid.
8589,"With all the unique damage that it does to the brain, heart, and lungs, there’s the chance that it could lead to serious problems like heart attacks later on."
8590,"Yeah, it was really surprising to see the pause."
8591,Just can't understand it considering the climate we are in.
8592,Is it just me or is Israel's stats kind of telling us that herd immunity is closer to 60% than what we have thought it is at 75%?
8593,"Yep, I think the CDC came out and said you have about a 1 in 10,000 chance of catching covid via surface transmission."
8594,If people get their shots we won't have a problem.
8595,Pretty simple.
8596,Encouraging to hear
8597,"Me too, though it is noticeable, but I am usually able to just ignore it."
8598,"No point in getting worked up about it, as that would simply be pointless."
8599,I believe were I live vaccination sites will start to close as well.
8600,I’m not ignoring them.
8601,The study is the one comparing them on basis of blood clots so that’s what I’m responding to.
8602,The selling point shouldn’t be I’m more likely to get a blood clot if I have covid versus getting the vaccine.
8603,That doesn’t make me want to take this particular vaccine at all.
8604,We are just starting our AZ vaccine type saga in the US.
8605,J+J was pulled less than five days ago.
8606,&gt;I am willing to take my chances here.
8607,But if you were a young woman with a clotting disorder maybe you wouldn't be.
8608,"And that's the reason for pause, to identify if there is a specific demographic at risk, and to advise them appropriately."
8609,People are mad at the FDA because it's a 1 in 1.1 million chance that you can develop a blood clot from the J&amp;J vaccine based on available data.
8610,"Just for comparison, birth control pills have a 1 in 1000 chance of causing blood clots in women."
8611,"It is the moral thing to do to let people know that this is an *exceedingly* rare side effect, but when it is this rare, you should not halt distribution, and you should let people make the decision for themselves."
8612,You're more likely to die in a car crash or die from COVID for Christ's sake.
8613,This is just the complete wrong move and will have drastically negative consequences for the rest of the world since it is the easiest of the vaccines to distribute because it only requires one dose.
8614,So indoor seating is an issue due to air circulation and COVID-19 being airborne.
8615,Nothing to do with fomite(surface) transmission.
8616,So having people wipe down chairs would be a bit pointless.
8617,[removed]
8618,Hey!
8619,I'm 43.
8620,You callin' me old?
8621,"And public health officials, being well intentioned, failed to appreciate how bad most people are at grasping what a one in a million chance really means for their behavior, advised caution when they saw something that is like a blurry shadow of a pattern, and inadvertently caused many more people to die because of the vaccine hesitancy that this whole post is dripping with."
8622,"The public health response was correct if this wasn't a contentious political issue and the efficiency of the vaccine rollout wasn't instrumental in saving lives; but for this covid vaccine, they could have been transparent without causing a panic and driving people away from getting vaccinated all together."
8623,This website is turning into a complete political propaganda site jfc
8624,&gt;The only upside in that respect is that generally speaking viruses grow increasingly resilient and contagious while often becoming less deadly at the same time.
8625,Only ones that face large selection pressure to become less deadly.
8626,That's not the case with COVID.
8627,"It only kills a small percentage who get it, and even that small percentage has weeks to transmit it."
8628,It is contagious before symptoms and in asymptomatic people.
8629,It is not facing any sort of strong selection pressure to become less deadly.
8630,[removed]
8631,OCD havers unite!
8632,It’s been a bad year.
8633,"Ironically, my fear of germs has gotten way better."
8634,I think the whole thing’s acted like involuntary exposure therapy.
8635,But then I just ended up with depression and different compulsions as a trade off...
8636,Part of it is the nature of this sub's visitors.
8637,Check post histories sometime--you'll see some... interesting... subs.
8638,If it is only 6 people then it will be short while they narrow down any common risk factors between the patients with adverse events.
8639,If there were a bunch of asymptomatic or subclinical cases then the pause will (rightly so) be longer to sort out the data.
8640,Full meaning available to people of all ages (including kids)?
8641,Pretty crazy how accurate they have been.
8642,This is something to celebrate?
8643,So depressing.
8644,I dont think I've worn a mask outside for the entire pandemic because it's completely unnecessary.
8645,Got my second shot yesterday.
8646,And boy did that make me feel like shit.
8647,I didn’t sleep a wink.
8648,"Fevers, sweating, headache, every bone and muscle hurt."
8649,But less than 24 hours later starting to feel much better.
8650,Can we please ban people from leaving said places without a vaccine?
8651,The rest of of sane folks want to go back to normal :(
8652,Fine them out of business

8659,This is bad scientific thinking.
8660,"The question is whether you are more likely to develop this clotting issue if you get vaccinated, period."
8661,Not whether the issue is more likely among people confirmed to have COVID.
8662,Many millions are unconfirmed cases of COVID.
8663,Many more millions won't even get COVID
8664,'Cult of the Cloth'?
8665,"Get a grip, bro."
8666,Masks are our best protection against transmitting covid short of vaccinations.
8667,"We're fucking lucky that a mask could offer such protection, and it does ffs"
8668,I've been vaccinated before every year of my life for seasonal flu and I got sick every time  I'm definitely not taking this one and I haven't gotten sick since 2019
8669,My frustration comes from the kids being at school all day.
8670,If they were exposed they were “supposed” to stay home until they knew whether or not someone was sick.
8671,And that the kids could still carry a viral load that could expose ME and get ME sick even if they don’t get sick.
8672,But the district doesn’t give two shits about the teachers.
8673,[deleted]
8674,Yep.
8675,"The US acquired a total of 250 million vaccine doses so far and only about 20 million are J&amp;J, of which about half have already been used."
8676,I saw a news report yesterday that said many of the uninsured or those in rural areas don’t realize that the vaccine is free.
8677,So the campaign strategy really needs to start telling people they don’t have to pay to get it.
8678,I have to wonder if more people will get vaccinated if they realize it won’t cost them anything
8679,I will be getting my Titers checked instead.
8680,Of course they want to vaccinate in 6 months.
8681,They make the damn product.
8682,What we need is a video.
8683,It starts out with a block of 370M people or so representing the population of America.
8684,Then it highlights (zooms in and colors) how many have already had COVID.
8685,And then how many had serious symptoms.
8686,And then how many have died.
8687,Then make a second block with everyone getting vaccinated and how many people would have serious symptoms from vaccination.
8688,And then those that would die from it.
8689,Then compare the two blocks side by side.
8690,*science is when web articles agree with me*
8691,"Oh boy, I love taking medical advice from big pharma CEO's."
8692,"Coronaviruses have a self-correcting mechanism when replicating that makes it mutate far, far more slowly than the flu which mutates a lot."
8693,"Meanwhile, Moderna is already working on a booster shot for variants that will probably be ready as early as this fall."
8694,Variants are probably not going to be a huge deal in the grand scheme of things once the world gets vaccinated.
8695,I lost all enthusiasm to get my second vaccine shot now.
8696,I have it scheduled but this is just sad.
8697,Good.
8698,The kid needs to stay home for awhile even if kid is negative - hope if they don't enforce it you can speak out.
8699,"No, Government officials in Germany are priority group 3 (out of 3, half the population is in no priority group), same as over 60 years old."
8700,So Merkel is in that group both due to age and her job.
8701,how do you know if you're developing blood clots in your brain?
8702,do you show any symptoms before it's too late?
8703,Everyone will likely need it.
8704,"From talking to people involved in conducting the Pfizer durability studies, antibody quality remains high (90%+) but antibody quantity diminishes to half of what people produce after the second shot in as little as three months."
8705,This is behavior is present even in young healthy individuals.
8706,Less than 10% is anywhere between &gt;0 and &lt;10 and no one is giving a figure that you can hang your hat on.
8707,"Again, the goal isn’t zero cases and zero risk."
8708,COVID is endemic and it’s not going anywhere.
8709,Try looking up the stress-diathesis model of disease
8710,"India is running a $20B/month trade deficit now which is huge enough to be causing devaluation of the Rupee, changing 50% in the last decade."
8711,That puts huge pressures on the upper middle class who have enormous political importance and now face purchasing power stagnation of their wages.
8712,"I would not blame the government if they prioritized domestic vaccination, but the trade deficit is so critical to keep under control if they want to keep the key demographic happy."
8713,People are frustrated at the number of misleading headlines from the media and how it seems to have tricked people into believing the vaccine only gives immunity for 6 months.
8714,"&gt; The same people who are saying, “it’s too early, give it just another month or two”, will be saying the same thing in 2 months."
8715,I don't understand why this strawman is so popular.
8716,"I'm extremely strict, and I've been telling people to wait a few more months."
8717,And you know what?
8718,"I'm planning to hold my first maskless hangout in June (starting outdoors, and then relaxing even more)."
8719,"Believe it or not, some of us are basing our decisions on the facts."
8720,The facts right now are that thousands of Americans are still dying every week.
8721,"It's going down, and it's likely that very few will be dying in June."
8722,How has the recovery been if you don't mind me asking?
8723,"I just had the same thing starting about 4 days ago minus the hearing loss, and the vertigo has been hell every time I move my head and is not improving yet."
8724,Diagnosed as vestibular neuritis from the first neurologist i could get in with.
8725,I don't see how it could have been from Covid as I've been extremely cautious but haven't been tested either.
8726,I'm now waiting on an appointment with a better neurologist to confirm diagnosis and hopefully start treatment.
8727,I keep seeing mixed messages on how successful recovery is and the whole thing is just very strange and out of nowhere.
8728,"Why can't they just give out the same anti clot medication i had to take when i went out from the hospital after having covid in ukraine, seems that could help the whole situation?"
8729,🤔
8730,US media is obsessed with race.
8731,"Doesn’t matter who is in the Oval Office, there’s always somebody to scapegoat."
8732,Last I heard they should have to quarantine for 7 days until dad is no longer contagious  then another 10 days to make sure mom isn’t sick.
8733,But it changes every week
8734,I bet subsequent shots won’t nearly be as bad but I guess I don’t know for sure

8739,Get a set of Powerblocks.
8740,Pound for pound they are an amazing option.
8741,Best single piece of equipment to own IMO.
8742,I assumed that we would need a booster every six months for the next three years to combat the variants and then an annual shot after that.
8743,It's time we start looking at agile vaccine development the same way they do agile software development.
8744,The dose I get next month is going to be different than the dose you get today.
8745,And the dose someone gets two months from now will be different than the dose I get next month.
8746,The vaccine will need to be tailored to the current emerging strains the same way they do for the influenza vaccine.
8747,But they will need to compress the timeline for doing they.
8748,Does the government shut down the city annually to get everyone’s oil changed?
8749,I think that’s the concern a lot of people have.
8750,Same for me.
8751,Woke up with chills last night.
8752,Took meds and they went away.
8753,Now I’m achy af with a 99 fever and I’m super tired.
8754,Worth every second.
8755,Estimated infection rate is closer to 24% ([80MM of ~330M Americans](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/burden.html)) per the CDC.
8756,So a little better than 1:4 chance you caught it already.
8757,"Odds will probably go down next year, but only because people are getting vaccinated so aggressively and exposure will also start to move us towards herd immunity."
8758,"On top of your excellent point, it's not a binary choice either."
8759,"It's AZ, one of the safer alternatives (in a little bit), or nothing."
8760,Given the odds are so low of catching it in a given month (1:40ish?)
8761,It's probably worth waiting a month or two for pfizer or moderna.
8762,This thing has animal reservoirs.
8763,"it'll keep popping up, but probably only small, localized flair-ups."
8764,Massachusetts resident checking in: we have an outdoor mask mandate still.
8765,"Adherence ranges from 90% of people wearing them to ~5%, depending on the town/city."
8766,"At least in my county, your class wouldn't have to quarantine if the kid is negative."
8767,That being said kids in our county aren't allowed back in school/ day care for 10 days if anyone in the household tests positive (even if the kid tests negative).
8768,I would walk out if my school/ day care allowed a kid with a positive parent to go to school before quarantine is up.
8769,That's insane and I'm sorry if they do that to you.
8770,"Seriously, report that shit to the FBI whenever you see it - they are taking it very fucking seriously."
8771,"Even if it's just a casual discussion on facebook, your screenshots can help narrow things down."
8772,These assholes can get upwards of 10 years for fraudulent forgery (plus fines) and I am sure federal prosecutors will happily make examples out of these fuckwads.
8773,They are being downvoted because the vaccine induced thrombocytopenia is not like other clotting issues caused by things like birth control.
8774,It is thought to be an auto immune reaction that has proteins bonding to platelets which causes a platelet reduction while simultaneously causing clots.
8775,The patients have widespread clotting and internal bleeding at the same time.
8776,That huge jump in a week for 18-29 is huge as in my county that age group tends to be  the one with the most cases.

8792,"government: ""hey instead of us using statistics and graphs and science to convince them lets treat them like children and use colorful cartoons or celebrities etc."""
8793,But this isn't saying that kids are now a higher percentage of the overall infection number.
8794,It is saying the rate of infections in younger age groups are rising.
8795,That has nothing to do with the other groups' rates of infections.

8800,I’m still feeling good about the vaccine.
8801,It's frustrating when the right thing to do is so freakin' obvious and they can't be bothered because of money.

8817,"If the government were knowingly giving healthy young women a vaccine that’s potentially more deadly for them than the disease, wouldn’t that fuel the anti-vaxx crowd?"
8818,Committed anti-vaxxers will latch onto any bad news about a vaccine.
8819,But there are many regular people who would lose trust in our vaccine safety standards in the scenario above.
8820,The issue here is lost trust in the J&amp;J vaccine versus lost trust in all vaccines.
8821,Well timed message as hospitalizations in FL are on the rise.
8822,I thought evidence so far suggests that the increased risk of blood clouts are limited to a very specific group?
8823,Why are they stopping it for everyone?
8824,Going off the current US data with 6 cases and 7+ million doses administered that leaves the possibility at a 0.0001% chance of a blood clot (assuming 7mil exactly and not more).
8825,A 1/1000 chance with birth control is a 0.1% chance.
8826,It's wild how hyped up this is getting.
8827,I'll continue to avoid people like I did even before covid.
8828,"You realize there is still quite a lot of the country without access to reliable, affordable high speed internet, right?"
8829,It’s far from done.
8830,It’ll be back
8831,Polling for public opinion tends to be different from political polling.

8833,"Healthcare is not free in that country for anyone under 65 (and even then not everything is covered, there's plenty of co-pays)."
8834,It's really not unreasonable for people to think that this would not be free.
8835,This is a very rare exception.
8836,Unless you heard about it prior you probably would assume that like everything else it has to be paid for.
8837,This is pure gold.
8838,It's going straight to my Facebook feed with the anti-vaxxers on it.
8839,"This is embarrassing, but I am a doctor and didn’t know it was free."
8840,(I thought it was and thought it should be but didn’t know for sure)
8841,They had signs at the health department that said to have your insurance card.
8842,I was very nervous when I got there because of that.
8843,(I have the kind of insurance where you pay 100% of everything)
8844,"I agree, but with a lot of states not even giving metrics on what it would take to end the mask mandates, they give a lot of room for premature ending of mask mandates."
8845,100% this.
8846,"And if you miss normal life and normal activities, like going to the gym, travelling, eating out, going to the theatre, meeting your family, practicing ""vain"" self care like getting your nails done etc., then people portray you as a privileged, ungrateful asshole."
8847,"During the shorter lockdown last spring, the measures sucked but there was an end in sight."
8848,"Now the measures are even stricter and they only get worse and they are always extended, so it feels like there's no point in following them."
8849,I imagine many people have stopped following the rules because why bother?
8850,It's not like anything changes.
8851,"To me, the rules seem increasingly pointless and increasingly desperate."
8852,"In my town, you now have to wear a mask in the car if you're not a member of the driver's household."
8853,"So, if I meet a friend, I can hang out with her maskless all day, but then when she drives me home I have to wear a mask 🤪  Maybe there's a sensible reason for this rule, but to most people it just seems like an annoying and pointless inconvenience."
8854,"Dont see how they couldn't just ""loan"" a bigger amount then."
8855,"The mexican AstraZeneca factory is complete and utter crap, over a month delay for the first doses to come out and an incredibly reduced amount"
8856,It's like no one at the CDC knows what a cost-benefit analysis is.
8857,According to the National Safety Council the chance of dying in a car accident is 1 in 103.
8858,I'm much more likely to die in a car accident than to have a bad reaction to the J&amp;J vaccine.
8859,Any of the vaccines is a worthless waste of time.
8860,&gt; vaccine herd immunity years out.
8861,"Either most places get to herd immunity inside of a year, or the chance of this thing mutating again and bypassing all of the vaccines goes up so high I would honestly consider moving to the middle of nowhere and starting a vegetable farm."
8862,"In other words, the vaccines are massively successful and doing what they're supposed to do."
8863,It's just the way they said it almost made it sound like they didn't care how high the risk is and then casual mention (the risk is probably low).
8864,"I was just teasing kind of lol

BTW happy cake day"
8865,He didn't actually say that.
8866,It was certainly qualified in terms of meeting certain criteria.
8867,It's amazing that in the US there's even a possibility this wouldn't have been free.
8868,Huh?
8869,That's not how that works.
8870,This is an increase in absolute numbers in this age cohort versus what was being seen previously.
8871,Vaccinations should actually help reduce the spread in all cohorts as more people are effectively immune.
8872,"&gt; but there have been 20 hospitalizations and three deaths among this group

That’s worrying..."
8873,In argentina we're getting some weird russian ones.
8874,They're called sputnik or something
8875,Do a little digging just in case.
8876,Because they make you sign that you're ultimately responsible for the cost they are very on top of billing you but can be super lazy chasing down the money from insurance.
8877,"Your insurance might not have paid it yet or they could have coded it wrong, but if they accept your insurance they have agreed to bill at a certain rate and you only pay the portion your insurance designated."
8878,We got a ridiculous $300+ bill and then nearly a month later I got the statement of benefits from insurance showing the payment in full.
8879,Wife's routine appt with standard labs.
8880,We have awesome insurance at a very low cost through our employer but the medical system in the US is still one of the absolute worst.
8881,"As someone in CA, my city's subreddit is pushing everyone to sign up and just lie about qualifying due to medical conditions."
8882,"My friends all over the state under 50 have gotten it through different avenues - lying, waiting for extra doses, etc."
8883,"My city just changed its dashboard to stop showing the % of over 16 population that has gotten the vaccine to the % of 75% of the population over 16, since they now claim that is the goal."
8884,Pretty telling they decided to switch.
8885,I'm guessing they see 75% as a stretch goal at this point.
8886,And I'm guessing CA will be a higher vaccination rate than many other states.
8887,"Israel only has 54.8% fully vaccinated *right now*, so that's not right."

8892,So you would die taking something that was meaning to prevent death...
8893,That happened to me too.
8894,It was actually a medical bus that came to the job to do the covid test.
8895,We had even got an email saying it was free.
8896,I got a bill for $200 from the lab and was shocked.
8897,I had to call the lab and argue with them.
8898,It was a mess and very discouraging.
8899,Lord of the rings reference 😉
8900,"My second shot was better, my arm was less sore and for a day less, though I worked my arms out before and after the shot."
8901,Felt slightly achy after 18 hours but it was almost negligible.
8902,I was expecting full flu like symptoms.
8903,You are correct.
8904,Some of our larger vaccination sites don’t even want your insurance info.
8905,They said it slows them down too much.
8906,I am surprised such a large number of people are not aware the vaccine is free.
8907,"In my state it has been stated countless times in the news, advertisements and social media."
8908,Even the forms we fill out for the vaccine says if you have no insurance it is still at no charge.

8915,"Covid tests were supposed to be free here in Minnesota, but I got a bill in the mail 2 months later for $180."
8916,Took about 3 hours on the phone with my insurance and the state to straighten it out.
8917,"The way the bill was structured, private insurance pays 100% of the administration fee."
8918,"If they do not cover 100% or they demand a copay, they are breaking federal law."
8919,Anyone who does not have insurance or does not give the clinic their insurance information is covered by the federal government.
8920,This includes if you are simply too lazy to bring your insurance card.
8921,"If you receive a bill for ANY amount for the vaccine, someone along the line has broken federal law."
8922,"Again, refusing health care because they fear the cost."
8923,Terrible.
8924,I really thinking people close to others influenced vaccine hesitancy.
8925,What’s hard is penetrating those “pockets” of holdouts
8926,you dont' know that they are rare enough for certain demographics... how do you know it's not a manufacturing defect?
8927,medication combination?
8928,medical history?
8929,and the rate at which we are getting blood clots now start increasing?
8930,there's very little harm in pausing since we have other vaccines... we are very likely to still vaccinate well over 3mm americans per day... what is a 4 week pause going to actually hurt?
8931,"where it starts hurting significantly is if its signifcantly longer than that... but if that starts happening then it's either:

a) we are going to hit vaccination targets with moderna and pfizer anway... like in denmark

b) or there are much more dangerous revelations about the adenovirus vaccines...

in either case the prudent thing is to pause and assess ... if this happened in trials would this have gotten authorization?"
8932,no?
8933,then why on earth would you choose to blow past it now?
8934,"They don't think of Healthcare as unaffordable, they know it isn't."
8935,"I just had a $7,000 bill from when I crushed the tip of my thumb off at work in November of 2019 arrive in my mailbox."
8936,"Had to argue with the place I used to work at because they had already closed out the workers comp claim, but finally got it paid."
8937,Why they waited over a year to send the bill is beyond me.
8938,Lol like anyone cares about your antivax opinion.
8939,"I hope you get banned from air travel, concerts, venues, and other areas until you're vaccinated."
8940,We don't need you to screw everything up
8941,Except for kids tho.
8942,"Many kids don't want to have it, spread it, or experience neurological (or heart, etc.)"
8943,impact for the rest of their lives.
8944,"Many kids want it to avoid those things, but have no chance under any circumstance to get vaccinated by May."
8945,The experts say maybe August or September.... others say not until 2022.
8946,"As adults, we would do well to care for our future generation by protecting them until they can get vaccinated so that they can continue their lives without any long-term or future covid effects (such as possible early onset parkinsonsn for example)."
8947,For once the US has it together.
8948,"Southern Louisiana, US here—33."
8949,Getting my second Pfizer dose Monday.
8950,Just got my second shot at the health department.
8951,No one was asking for insurance either time.
8952,Not since ACA.
8953,Now only your age and location is taken into consideration.
8954,"Oh and smoking, they can charge you more for that."
8955,i wanted the J&amp;J shot.....it causes blood clots.....i want to know the side effects of all shots now.
8956,"Yeah, I think the FDA came out early against anything other than the 3-4 weeks tested at large scale by Pfizer or Moderna, but other studies have shown pretty high efficacy from just a single dose."
8957,"And for some populations, you’re right, it’s not easy to get 2-dose so if the option is no vaccine or a single shot of Pfizer or Moderna it’s much better to get the single shot."
8958,"unless you're salary, then hurry up"
8959,"It actually messes up communication for small children to a very great extent, not a small inconvenience"
8960,Fair for now.
8961,Id suggest other people get comfortable right damn quick tho.
8962,I’m assuming you didn’t see the edit to my comment above (I apologise for that as I have a fragmented thought process).
8963,I’m just trying to bring up a meaningful conversation on the inherent misogyny in medicine and the cavalier attitudes towards women’s reproductive health.
8964,Like in said in my edit above; why do clots from the AZ vaccine (1 in 25000 people) merit banning of the vaccine (Denmark) while clots from birth control pills (1 in 1000) were not subjected to the same level of scrutiny from the medical profession?

8976,It might not cost you money.
8977,"But trust me you, it’s not free!"
8978,I'm surprised the state isn't enforcing any consistency across the different counties.
8979,I have bcbs in California as well and I did the exact same thing.
8980,Not risking a surprise charge if I’m already paying taxes anyways.
8981,That's the issue with rushing vaccines.
8982,There's not enough trials.
8983,All of us are basically in the trial when we get the shot.
8984,I'm all for getting the vaccine (actually getting it on the 26th because Canada was slow rolling it out)but it feels like all of the vaccines right now were rushed and I get it they had to be rushed but still.
8985,"Yup, just imagine the cost to the economy when it finally goes single payer and all these jobs disappear."
8986,I’m 23 and had mine a month ago (UK)
8987,Not just websites.
8988,Got mine at my local grocery stores pharmacy.
8989,They asked for my insurance info and acted surprised when I said I had none.

9013,Yup.
9014,I asked the clinic I was going to once if they accepted my insurance.
9015,"Made sure multiple times, including asking my insurance about the doctor."
9016,Everyone said it was covered.
9017,I go to my appts (multiple in a 1 month period).
9018,I ended up getting billed $1600...took me a year or more to pay that surprise bill back after all this.
9019,Why the hell not?

9033,Your comment makes me happy as there’s nothing better than hearing a testimony from boots on the ground.
9034,Would you say that vaccines are definitely working for you guys in Cali or is it just that the people have decided to social distance/mask up and stop gathering etc.

9038,We need to get NASCAR on board with vaccine requirements.
9039,That should do the trick!
9040,I bet those 7 million know everything going on in the life of their constituents on Facebook though.
9041,"Yeah, but I guess the question is: should you take the vaccine and risk your health or stay indoors and not?"
9042,Especially when there are other vaccines out there that seemingly don’t have these issues.
9043,"I think I think these vaccines (ones that can cause clots in rare situations) overall are still the right thing, but I can also see why governments would put them on hold too."
9044,All my fam in the other side of the pond took astra zeneca and they're doing just fine
9045,I already caught covid and recovered fully.
9046,"Personally, I’m over this."
9047,Just waiting for the restrictions to end.
9048,Get it.
9049,Demand is becoming an issue.
9050,80% of 65+ have gotten it.
9051,"What do we know about the immunity granted from getting infected, say, in July 2020 against the new variants becoming dominant?"
9052,Is it the same pretty much as with the vaccines?
9053,There' has indeed been several reported cases of blood clots associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections.
9054,"The important thing to do here, which several countries are taking into account, is to look at the risk-benefit of taking the AZ/J&amp;J vaccines in certain populations."
9055,We know that the mortality rate in the more elderly population for example far exceed the risk of VIPIT and therefore it is still wise to take the AZ vaccine in the population given the rarity of VIPIT.
9056,The other factor to keep in mind is that many developing countries do not have the liberty of being able to meet the requirements for the storage of the mRNA based vaccines.
9057,I've mentioned elsewhere that I personally agree to the move several countries are taking in vaccinating the older population (and those living in countries which  are less developed/unable to meet the storage requirements of mRNA based vaccines) with AZ.
9058,Furthermore we've seen that  hospitalisations were prevented following one dose of AZ  by 94% so there's no doubt that it's an effective vaccine.
9059,What it ultimately comes down to is being able to provide a choice/alternative for the higher risk groups where the risk-benefit ratio is not so clear cut.
9060,How is what they're doing now not extending the pause?
9061,"Either, it's continuing to get administered, it's being discontinued, or it's paused."
9062,How can it be something other than those three?
9063,"Hm, yeah, I suppose you're right."
9064,That's just semantics though.
9065,"The second sentence in this article is quite a read:

""Denver on Friday will move to ""Level Blue,"" which allows restaurants and gyms to operate at 100% capacity, though six-foot social distancing will still be in place, limiting capacity somewhat."""
9066,Can’t you just get it and not tell your employer?
9067,I literally live on a boat off of an island lol
9068,There is a good argument to be made that medical service should be a public service like fire or police service.

9073,"I mean, 1 flight attendant for every 50 passengers, it’s sometimes hard for them to track everyone onboard"
9074,It’s kinda weird being a 18 y/o woman who’s had AZ.
9075,"Not that there aren’t any others of course, however it’s odd to think you’ve had a vaccine that is now banned across the world for your age group."
9076,"Don’t regret it for a second, get the vaccine folks."
9077,Torn on whether to get my first dose of Moderna tomorrow or not which my school is offering.
9078,I had covid back in December and I’m 22.
9079,Given demand &gt; supply still for vaccine I can’t help shake my thoughts that someone else should get this dose instead of me - literally anyone that hasn’t had covid or is older.
9080,So Pfizer has requested authorization for 12+ but I don't see anything ab on it when the fda might review this and when we could expect to see a ruling on it?
9081,Those are some crazy numbers!
9082,I'll be getting my second dose on Friday!
9083,If there was a path that was known for pieces of aircraft to constantly have pieces fall on it and there was a slightly longer path next to it where that did not happen you are pretty idiotic to take that more dangerous path.

9172,Not sure why you’re being aggressive but it’s recorded to my insurance account.
9173,Everything is linked and it’s the easiest way to keep that record at this moment since people can get a vaccine almost anywhere.
9174,You actually can’t say that in the future a primary’s office won’t get a record of current patients who have had their vaccination just for the pure ease of it as opposed to hoping their patient can wrangle up a card and present it to them in the future visit.
9175,Now there’s a record of the dose along with a specific id number as well as the prescribing doctor somewhere digitally saved which is far more efficient.
9176,That’s all also linked to your primary who’s also on that insurance card.
9177,It’s most likely just another column added to an excel sheet.
9178,Thank you.
9179,I’m not anti-vaxx by any means.
9180,I didn’t have a choice for the vaccines.
9181,I’ve been trying to stay as informed as possible.
9182,"Given the choice, I would definitely choose the Pfizer over all the others."
9183,"It appears to be the most stable, and effective."
9184,"I live in the USA, and AZ wasn’t approved here."
9185,"Given the issues, and pauses, I’m thankful for that."
9186,"We have a lot of anti-Vaxx here, and having to pause vaccines is going to add fuel to the fire."
9187,"After I got my first does, I continued to follow guidelines."
9188,I don’t really care how effective it might be with 1/2 of the vaccine series.
9189,"The end result, with the least complications is the goal."
9190,"The vaccines that are pulling ahead, with least problems, and best efficacy should be pushed."
9191,Rather than trying to prop up ones that aren’t as effective.
9192,"I get we want to get as many people inoculated as possible, worldwide, but getting them the most effective medicine is important."
9193,"The parameters of the study seem strange, as they’re addressing a mid-point, and not the end point."
9194,"One dose is not where you should stop, in a two dose treatment."
9195,They want to see if there are any more reactions in the 14 day window post vaccination.
9196,Honestly I don’t think it’s unreasonable given theyll have a lot more data since most J&amp;J has been administered less than 2 weeks ago.
9197,Also gives them time to study the cases of side effects and see if there are any more cases they did not count.
9198,Best case scenario two weeks from now we have a large surplus of J&amp;J ready to ship.
9199,Worst case scenario we completely ban J&amp;J and finish vaccine program maybe 2 weeks to a month later and there is increased vaccine hesitancy.
9200,It’s not the end of the world either way and I suspect this won’t have much of an impact on most people’s opinions.
9201,"You mean places like TX who lifted it, then tried to sue cities for keeping them?"
9202,"You're out here crediting the mandate lifting while ignoring the efforts to stop cities doing their own thing, and simultaneously celebrating the low numbers relative to past months because the cities did their own thing."
9203,Funny indeed.
9204,"This strayed, so to recap: you supported your initial dismissal of my comparison with the argument that ""adequate"" lockdowns lead to ""better economy""."
9205,If we take US for example the lockdown was not adequate nor was it well timed.
9206,So in the case of US my initial comparison still stands.
9207,"Again, feel free to disagree."
9208,That's all from me at this point.
9209,"I don't want exact dates as much as commitments like ""when x happens restriction y will be removed""."
9210,"If you just say May 1st, you're just saying ""fuck it"" with people's lives."
9211,"Instead, if you say ""when the state experiences fewer than 100 cases per million for a week straight, then you're being clear and going off the data."
9212,"The case data is going to get better as vaccination rates rise, have faith in that."
9213,Especially as younger/more risk tolerant folks can get the shot and cut the spread.
9214,"Isn't it also important for people to know Covid can also sometimes cause CVST, albeit probably rare?"
9215,"You know the new safe distance for social distancing is 3 feet, according to CDC."
9216,So yes?
9217,You could take a vacation in Sweden.
9218,"Even more complicated when those 6 were perfectly healthy otherwise, and as it seems so far, younger."
9219,Wise move.
9220,"Well, yeah."
9221,I'm not saying eat a diet exclusively of Twinkies.
9222,"The problem is, Twinkies are easy to get, packed with sugar, and probably cheaper than a healthy meal."
9223,"I don't have no clue what number we need to get too ,I just stop at that number because it just seemed to make sense to stop there."
9224,Israel is at about 65% with vaccinated and natural immunity and experts think they have hit herd immunity.
9225,So about 55% vaccinated is a good number to aim for

9232,So still 4x as dealdy.

9264,But the executive order requiring counties to adhere to the dial is expiring in a few days.
9265,"And on top of that the dial has been changed so many times (in fairness, each change has worked out) that I can only assume it would be dropped before most counties actually meet the current one."

9305,I've been trying to get info but all I manage to dig are news about how the vaccine is unsafe.

9324,The definitive statement was originally in response to someone saying the expect to get infected eventually which argued that such a belief was absurd because the vaccine prevents infection.
9325,My position is the accurate one.
9326,Now I agree with you that this is ultimately an argument about how to propagandize.
9327,I'm just taking the position that incorrectly pretending that there is no risk if infection after vaccination not only feeds the anti-vax folks but also creates increased risk during the transition period until we reach herd immunity.

9363,"** (The red zone is defined as having 100 or more new cases per 100,000 residents in one week."

9481,There exist some non-zero risk.
9482,"However, at this point I think the risk is pretty damn close to zero."
9483,"First off, there are MANY health risks that are higher for men than women and vica versa."
9484,Just because it affects one does NOT imply it will affect the other.
9485,The fact that they are genetically near identical is not how biological works.
9486,There are hormonal differences between men and women which create different interactions.
9487,"To go even further, saying because they are genetically similar there is reason to believe they are going to have similar interactions is... silly."
9488,You know old people and young people are genetically nearly identical?
9489,"And yet, despite that, old people and young people have very different health risks."
9490,"Genetics is one part, environmental and contextual is another massive part of medicine."
9491,"The fact that after millions and millions of injections there haven't been any cases of men getting clots implies, at the VERY least, that men are less likely to get it."
9492,The odds of this many women having symptoms and NO men is nearly very unlikely if they have the same risk.
9493,"So yes, I am going to go ahead and take back assertion that there is zero risk."
9494,That was wrong.
9495,"However, at this point in time, until SOME cases of men show up with the symptoms, the most scientific statement is near zero risk."
9496,"If I simply missed the story that there are men with cases, I'll immediately withdraw."
9497,No question.
9498,"But based on what I am currently aware of, there is no known risk to men."
9499,"Nice idea, but it feels anvilicious."
9500,I see this kind of outreach devolving into scapegoating and condescension.
9501,But maybe not.

9521,There's also the severity and the (perceived) degree of control.
9522,"It's like when someone says, ""why are you scared of flying, car accidents are more common?"""
9523,"Yeah, but your chance of surviving a plane crash is basically nil, and when you're driving your car, you can at least know that you're doing your best to be safe."
9524,"Same thing with blood clots (which are an actual anxiety of mine, unlike flying)."
9525,"It's the fear that it sits there, undetected, then boom, you have a few seconds/minutes to realize you're dying and it's all over."
9526,I think part of the problem was IOC committee gave Japan an ultimatum.

9534,"I mean you challenged the proposition of 

\&gt; risk of vaccine side effects outweighs risk or covid for younger people

and stated that you're the expert in the field."
9535,I think you should do some more research because most of what you are writing is nonsense.
9536,You even get the basics wrong.
9537,I think what you and most people who never studied medicine don’t understand is sometimes side effects take decades to show up.
9538,"Your find today, but 30 years down the round you will develop a tumor, cancer, or maybe have liver failure."
9539,"Sometimes they don’t even effect you, but effect your unborn child."
9540,That’s why there is so much red tape.
9541,Hell even sometimes the red tape fails to keep out a dangerous drug.
9542,In the end this whole thing was politicized.
9543,Shit was/is disgusting to watch.
9544,"If someone doesn’t want to get the vaccine, because they don’t know if it’s safe, there is nothing wrong with that."
9545,"Injecting yourself with something without verifying the side effects, is a lot to ask."
9546,Kids are safer from the virus.
9547,"Normally I’m one for giving as much power to the individual as possible, but there are a few issues here."
9548,"We don’t have full data on who’s impacted and to what extent because there was a massive surge in J&amp;J vaccines last week, and these clots take 1-2 weeks to develop."
9549,It’s wise to stop vaccinating to get the data that can be used to inform the public.
9550,"If the only people impacted are young women, then great, give J&amp;J to everyone else."
9551,"Also, regulatory bodies for medicine exist for a reason."
9552,J&amp;J risks losing its approval here.
9553,Should the government administer a vaccine while they investigate whether it should lose its approval?
9554,Yeah that person is a special kind of stupid.
9555,They were obviously in clinic studies because we need to find out exactly how to keep other people from becoming this dumb.
9556,But there’s not a safety risk to wearing masks.
9557,"So if you have a small but real risk without them, and you can mitigate that risk by wearing them, why wouldn’t you do so?"
9558,"Hey, we 1965 and 1966ers are NOT Boomers."
9559,Thank you.
9560,"(We are still old and probably just as annoying, but NOT Boomers)"
9561,[removed]
9562,Probably not until it got to this same point further down the road.
9563,The percentage is so low we're *only* seeing it after millions of doses administered.
9564,"I disagree, that's a very big number."
9565,For herd immunity we need everything we can get.
9566,People who don't realize it's free are likely easier to get vaccinated (tell them it's free) versus antivaxxers or hesitant people who are going to new much harder to convince
9567,The article doesn't give the number of 'fully vaccinated' people that have been tested for COVID post-vaccination.
9568,"So it's 5800 out of whatever that number is, not 5800 out of 77 million."
9569,It would be helpful to have numbers to compare positive percentages between vaccinated people and unvaccinated people.
9570,Hopefully the vaccinated people are far less lately to test positive.
9571,"Over the last 3 months, it really seems like testing has been deemphasized from what some people did for the first 10 months of Covid."
9572,The people in charge of things really haven't done a good job of messaging lately.
9573,We have one vaccine that has been stopped for possibly causing blood clots less frequently than birth control.
9574,The CDC director changes her mind every other day.
9575,The vaccinated face of 'experts' is talking down vaccines and talking about what he won't do while vaccinated.
9576,It might become apparent in the next 3 months that things are being bungled here.
9577,Yea that’s why they said social and not business or government.
9578,Most copays are 25 or less.
9579,Where are you seeing unaffordable copays?
9580,Saying viral vectors are on their way out and will be gone tomorrow are totally different.
9581,I think for typical vaccine development on their way out could mean 10+ years.
9582,Not only is it free but it makes your belly button generate a wifi that the government uses to spy on you.

9586,do you have any idea how many people won't just go for the mrna vaccines within the 2-4 weeks it takes to assess this situation?
9587,how many people are just going to lose access period to a vaccine for two weeks?
9588,"the jnj vaccine was a whopping 3% of vaccinations so far.... pfizer just said they can increase capacity to deliver more than 10% more vaccines through the end of may...

who exactly is not getting shots that want it?"
9589,The future is now thanks to science!
9590,I got J&amp;J two weeks ago (I’m excited to start doing stuff again).
9591,Should I be at all concerned about clotting after the first few weeks?
9592,Is there a chance i could be at risk for the rest of my life or something like that?
9593,maybe women just care about other people more than males do.
9594,This is literally socialist communism!
9595,Is it free with no insurance?

9614,We don't generally think about it.
9615,I will admit I'm not qualified to compare one to the other and certain drugs are more dangerous depending on people's medical history but this is why having multiple options of treatment or vaccination is better for everyone.

9626, My sister received a $50 bill from Kroger for administering the vaccine.
9627,What’s up with that?
9628,"This may also be a worse comparison, because the second dose doesn't appear do much for viral vector vaccines (because of viral vector immunity)."

9643,"It was there just like my car insurance, if I crash and burn I won't be in debt till I die."
9644,Getting the vaccine was one of the weirdest feelings in my life.
9645,"Had a knot in my stomach before and after, all the time sort of wondering when I was supposed to get my credit card."
9646,Fucking hate medical care here.
9647,&gt;If they knew this was an issue with AZ and it could show up since they are a similar technology I would have appreciated knowing that risk ahead of time.
9648,That's super understandable.
9649,"Remember that one hypothesis (which we now, unfortunately, have to consider less likely to be true) is that the problems with the AZ vaccine were related to the non-prefusion-stabilized spike protein in the AZ vaccine, whereas the spike protein produced by the JnJ and mRNA vaccines is prefusion stabilized."
9650,"Meanwhile, the JnJ and AZ vaccines are based on different Adenoviruses."
9651,(The AZ vaccine is based on a modified chimpanzee adenovirus; the JnJ uses a human adenovirus.
9652,"The Sputnik vaccine uses a pair of human adenoviruses ... and if you believe Russia, it doesn't cause clotting issues - although I'm not sure we should believe Russia."
9653,"Cansino is also an adenovirus-vectored vaccine, and they're claiming no clotting issues, although, again, how much do we trust them?"
9654,"So while before we were aware of these JnJ incidents, the idea that the adenovirus vector might be the culprit was certainly one of the possibilities (and I wouldn't be surprised if they discovered these clots because they were looking, because of the AZ virus) it wasn't the only one."
9655,"To say it's a ""similar"" technology is true as far as it goes, but there are actually somewhere around a dozen AD26 (the same as the jnj vax) viral vector vaccines out in the world (albeit they're almost all still in trial stages): for Ebola, Zika, Malaria, RSV, filovirus, and others, without, as far as I know, reports of clotting issues (with the big caveat that the numbers are too low to have confidence that they'd show up)."
9656,"So at the the time they gave you the shot, the best they could have said is ""The blood clots with AZ might be caused by a viral vector similar but not identical to the viral vector we're using here, but they also might not be."""
9657,"Like I said, I order plenty of takeout so the restaurants I would normally dine in at are still getting my money."

9715,can you actually quantify how many people won't be vaccinated at all due to this pause?
9716,meaning people who will forego vaccinations altogether and not simply move forward with either of the mrna vaccines?
9717,no?
9718,then how can you possibly know it's costing actual lives?
9719,"Right, but even going back to the denominator being:

* March 1, 5,800 / 25,446,405 = 0.0227%

Still muchhh lower than general population, and I'm sure the 5,800 was lower 6 weeks ago as well"
9720,"Um the data we have that the risk of hospitalization or death from covid in children is very low is what is objectively true, meaning that any additional risk-lowering gained by making kids wear masks in the fall is marginal."

9729,I was so surprised at how cheap it was.
9730,FYI I paid zero.
9731,"It's definitely great, as there are 12 times more cases every day."
9732,Hence it's definitely highly effective.
9733,"However, I would not devide 5,800 by the number of vaccinated people."
9734,"One, because I think they count two weeks after the second dose, and two because the number has increased with time."

9779,It's been a great transition.
9780,"The only issue I seem to have is coming across lots of hostility in online spaces :))
Perhaps you just weren't eating the right foods?"
9781,"&gt;I’ve been telling people all along: If all your customers die, how will you keep your business open then?"
9782,"If 30 percent of your students die, how will it be in your classroom or school then?"
9783,If this is what you have been telling people then its no wonder nobody is listening to you.
9784,This is an absurdly outrageous hyperbole that neither has nor has ever had any basis in the reality of the CV situation.
9785,Talk to your doctor.
9786,Not Reddit.
9787,bruh why would they try and do that to someone...
9788,"In x months you'll say ""We don't even know if the vaccine is effective after 6 + x months""."
9789,"We don't have time machines my man, literally the best we can say is ""we've followed patients for a median of 6 months, haven't seen any major drop in antibodies, and still see 90+% efficacy"", which is exactly what Pfizer and Moderna have said with their latest updates this month."
9790,"The fact that they haven't observed any drop offs in effectiveness, and that it looks like they can handle variants just fine gives a pretty solid reason to expect them to provide lasting immunity."
9791,I feel the same way about Vegans.
9792,"In a completely nonjudgmental way, I’m curious what makes you want to enroll your child?"
9793,Are you nervous about adverse affects?
9794,Asking because I am a mother of three young children and would fear the worst but am intrigued at the prospect of not having to worry about my kids getting Covid.
9795,&gt; Michigan is a bloodbath.
9796,"Looks like their case count is nearly at their high from a few months ago, and their death count is slowly rising."
9797,What I'm interested in -- and what we won't know for a month or so -- is if the deaths rise as much as they did a few months ago too or if they're lower.
9798,"It's great but the denominator has increased with time, so it's probably a higher percentage in practice"
9799,Then you should report the place because that's illegal.
9800,Thanks!
9801,"Well, I wouldn't call 2 newspapers (Handelsblatt and Bild), one of them a tabloid, running a wrong story for one day a firestorm."
9802,"But you're right, AZ is not responsible for that particular mess."
9803,* My opinion is betterer because it's a bullet point.
9804,Link?
9805,Saying that a vaccine passport creates a two tier society is like saying a driving license does.
9806,It’s about reducing the risk while we are in the pandemic.
9807,You can allow vaccinated people to do more safely than unvaccinated people.
9808,Once the pandemic is over the vaccine passports will not be used anymore.
9809,"But not a COVID one, yet."
9810,Surprised Michigan is so sparse.
9811,Is Detroit really that empty?
9812,What is severe case in Sinovac and J&amp;J trials?
9813,"I have undocumented friends, and what I heard is that is fine to show up to the vaccine appointment with zero documents like a passport or something; meaning, if you think someomes afraid to get vaccines because they fear deportation, encourage them to attend their appointment with no documents that could put them at risk."
9814,"if the person at the front or whatever doesn’t know that they have to vaccinate you anyway, escalate a little (as is safe) and a store manager will help you proceed."
9815,"(most people checking appointments are not always familiar with the nuanced immigration statuses) 

anyway, popular post and buried bla bla but if you’re reading this help us spread; whether or not you agree with undocumented immigrants getting rights or whatever, is way better for our public safety that they get vaccinated, so please help us get the word around!"

9823,"No, I know."
9824,But I’ve had so many billing and processing errors that I just can’t force myself to willingly involve my insurance.
9825,I wouldn’t have been able to handle it if the admin.
9826,fee turned out to be like a “free” annual physical.
9827,What if I fucked up and asked a question?
9828,Would it suddenly be billed as an office visit?
9829,Who’s going to fix it when the billing is incorrect in their favor?
9830,I don’t have time.
9831,I can’t afford to miss work to play their games.
9832,People don’t trust that anything can be free with insurance because it never has been.
9833,Avoiding the vax due to fear of a surprise bill is the one antivax excuse that I can emphasize with.
9834,It sucks and hopefully educating helps get more people scheduled.
9835,"Florida, once again supporting their well-earned reputation."
9836,Same.
9837,Get vaccinated and get all your friends to get it too!
9838,Need to make it an awesome summer

9842,"They don't do anything better than a well run government operation and by global standards, the USA is absolutely killing it in getting shots in people's arms."
9843,"IIRC, a government agency put a man on the moon, pioneered the Internet, pioneered GPS and many many more technologies."
9844,I would love to see UPS or Fedex do the job of the USPS all while their capital is being strangled by bullshit pension funding rules designed to cripple them.
9845,how will you ever be a super spreader then?
9846,It's been a dire scenario ever since the curve started spiralling last year.
9847,"We were terrified of a complete collapse back then, and the imminent second wave was always on the horizon even if Politicians very vehemently spoke otherwise."
9848,"Add to that, a massive chunk of the population that would put evangelical boonies to shame, and you can see why the situation in India keeps getting worse."

9850,If you were wearing a mask there is a good chance you are safe.
9851,"Best thing to do is to social distance for a few days, make sure to take care, and test when there has been enough time."
9852,thanks for sharing!
9853,"if more people have info like this, spread it!"
9854,you never know who’s one of the 10 thousand today
9855,5800 out of 77 million?
9856,So less than 1 in 1000?
9857,That means the vaccines are even more effective in the real world than in the trials.
9858,Birth control also causes blood clots 50-1200 cases in 1 million patients.
9859,That’s 0.05 - 0.12%.
9860,Women under 40 are usually the ones who take birth control so the chance for them to develop blood clots is higher
9861,Saw three people with a bullshit antivax post on their insta stories right after I had gotten my second Pfizer shot so I responded accordingly by posting my Covid card out of pure spite.
9862,"One of them viewed my story then deleted their antivax post, ngl felt good meng."
9863,Don’t get me started.
9864,She also said she knows a person whose husband was paralyzed from the waist down because of it.
9865,She said that after the previous claim and that caused me to say “wow you must know a lot of people!” which made her pretty pissy.
9866,I then told her I flat out don’t believe her and that if that were true then it’s either a one in a million case or if it’s as common as you’re saying then a year from now if you go out in public you’re going to see people in wheelchairs everywhere.
9867,I hope some part of her realized how her claims just don’t add up.
9868,"I mean, wouldn’t the hospitals be absolutely slammed right now even if there was a severe adverse reaction of even one percent?"
9869,And yes... the “mainstream” news would indeed be reporting it if it were true.
9870,She’s too far gone sadly.
9871,I regret even engaging her.
9872,There’s nothing to be gained.
9873,Sorry for the rant lol.

9875,You are a good and reasonable person :)
9876,"""Papers please."""
9877,"I really hate the implications and what it could mean for future oppressive actions, but admit the idea of protecting us from _those people_ is compellingly attractive."
9878,It just could be a bell that we wouldn't be able to un-ring.
9879,Why is the long COVID feel unreasonable?
9880,"That shit fucks people up, possibly forever."
9881,We wouldn't be testing it on kids if we weren't incredibly confident it was safe.
9882,Thanks for the info
9883,"200,739."
9884,Nicely done.
9885,I see people go out and about without masks  and they just don't care.
9886,"They absolutely don't, unless it's someone close to them who gets admitted."
9887,"Its like Schrodingers cat, to these people the virus doesn't exist until someone in their close social circle gets it and dies then it suddenly becomes very real for them."
9888,"I am predicting that we gonna get , 500k cases per day by end of May when it finally stabilizes."
9889,A lot of people are gonna die.
9890,Why?
9891,Most people recover from covid at home.
9892,What else can you expect when a hyper-religious chunk of an already struggling nation just doesn't care?
9893,"If we weren't extremely confident there was no risk to the kids, we wouldn't be testing it on kids."
9894,"Sure, happy to help."
9895,"Firstly - no shame, no embarrassment."
9896,"I tried to tough guy through it for far too long, but having a hyperactive vasovagal is not something that I can control."
9897,Be totally up front with your Dr/nurse that you have a history of fainting due to vasovagal issues.
9898,"They will appreciate being told, and they will help you as if you faint on site, much more paperwork for them!"
9899,For me - I make sure I am lying down when I have it done.
9900,It doesn't hurt at the time at all.
9901,"However, because of the vasovagal reaction I know that if I get up I will faint."
9902,So I ask them to slowly lift the bed from flat to sitting over a period of time.
9903,"My reactions are very severe, so this can take up to 30-45 minutes."
9904,Do everything really slowly.
9905,"Once you are sitting on the edge of the bed, stay there for a few minutes too."
9906,Then have a walk round inside before you leave the building.
9907,For a long time I used to feel really guilty about taking up so much medical professionals time for something that for 99% of the population is standard and done within a minute.
9908,"I actually got through this injection without fainting (the staff were brilliant), but I fainted the next morning getting out of bed."
9909,I got out of bed quite quickly (needed the toilet!)
9910,"thought, 'don't feel so good', thought of the injection, and then was gone."
9911,"So even the next morning, take your time."
9912,Hope this helps
9913,Dope.
9914,Thanks for the info
9915,Yeah pretty much but at least I got a mRNA vaccine.
9916,[removed]
9917,"Because the cost of producing and supplying it to different buyers is different and depends on many factors such as where batches for each buyer are produced and the associated different wage costs, transport costs, infrastructure costs etc etc."

&amp;#x200B;

They just discontinued it like Denmark."
9922,"And thinking that they then, in some kind of magic show of welfare will give out free jabs to anyone who likes it, is insane."
9923,That's not how the world works.
9924,Much more likely is the vaccine then to be shipped to states who would like it.
9925,"In AZ that's all you NEED too, but it asks if you have insurance and I think that might get some people worried that they're going to get billed."
9926,"Oh I know, I'm not saying it's nefarious or anything."
9927,"I just have seen some websites that don't stress that you wont be billed, and I think your average person not looking too deep is going to think, uh, if I need insurance I'm going to have to pay for this."
9928,Great reason to shut them down for ever  !
9929,"10usd for Pvt test, free govt test."
9930,I got a moderna at a pharmacy and another person I know got J&amp;J at the same one.
9931,What cost though?
9932,The time lost?
9933,Wait till you can wander into a pharmacy.
9934,A sore arm?
9935,"It's your brother, explain you'll be punching him in the arm until he goes and gets it."
9936,"Hell, you get free donuts and shit if you go get one."
9937,* **Every post has to have one utter fucking moron to give less hope to humanity....**
9938,"Upstate NY, isn't it"
9939,It doesn't even have to be specifically 3 weeks to the day - it's currently recommended for 21 days but 16-42 are considered acceptable (iirc - the range is something like that).
9940,Any time of day is fine.
9941,"UK domestic AZ production is 2m a week, that would be 1 year to vaccinate every adult ignoring other vaccines."
9942,It is the vaccine shortage that is hurting us right now plus all three variants are running wild up here as an extra kick to the teeth.
9943,"&gt; Would much rather be charged $100

Sounds pretty selfish to me."
9944,There are reasons that they are vaccinating people other than you and your $100.00 does not make you more important.
9945,"This is why public health care will NEVER work in the USA

In Canada, all people that I have talked to are HAPPY to wait their turn while the vulnerable and front line workers, teachers etc."
9946,get vaccinated.
9947,"On the bright side, the more people that are vaccinated are more people that won't infect you."
9948,Massively
9949,"Yeah, the first dose, or first dose plus two weeks number is what matters."
9950,0% to 80% matters more than 80% to 95%.
9951,"&gt; I told them this was the rare time the government truly made something free

Aren't all vaccines free in the US?"
9952,"I want it, but it's out all around me."
9953,No one is 'advocating' anything.
9954,They are reporting on preliminary trial results.
9955,It doesn't matter anyway as it's hardly like you can just go out and pick a vaccine and stick it into your arm.
9956,At least in the UK.
9957,"If you have had the AZ vaccine for your first dose, you will be given the AZ vaccine for your second."
9958,Nope.
9959,"The meaningful milestone is first shots, or maybe two weeks past the first shot."
9960,The jump from 0% protected to 80-90% matters way more than the jump from 80-90% to 95%.
9961,"That's the metric that matters, and instead we mostly see two dose numbers, when one dose should be the headline number."
9962,"I'm not going to fully change my behaviour till two weeks after the second shot, but my area is very low caserates and I'd happily hang out inside at a friend's house, or eat indoors at a restaurant."
9963,Govrnment wants this to be the last ever lockdown.
9964,So they're crushing covid while also going for the 70% herd immunity.
9965,"It means that when we're fully open in June, we'll be back to normal."
9966,Whereas countries like the US and EU are still fretting about cases and rising hospitalisations.
9967,do you think the virus can mutate so hard in a year's time that not even T-cells recognize it?
9968,"Or just antibodies (which go away relatively quickly)

honest question, im trying to learn about the role of T-cells in covid"
9969,"A study finds is certainly more legitimate than ""people on reddit baselessly speculate""."
9970,It wasn't rushed.
9971,If they wanted to rush it we would have had them way before the predicted winter peak.
9972,😂 that's fucking great
9973,Thatsthepoint.jpg
9974,You’re implying that’s not what Fauci is already saying
9975,/r/Fragilewhiteredditor
9976,"""our"" public health officials."
9977,You're in China.
9978,I'm still okay having got moderna lol
9979,"Aaaahhhhh yes, patience with that super overused phrase ""we are now in the most critical phase/wave/time"""
9980,"My employer is not only overnight shots on-site, they’re giving $100 to every employee that fully vaccinates."
9981,How about european federalism without patriotism?
9982,"Does the second dose have to be 3 weeks later **to the hour**, or anytime during that day?"
9983,"Fairly soon the unvaccinated population and the vaccinated one will look fairly similar, as eligibility opens all the way up."
9984,"If anything, the vaccinated population will skew old, and therefore more likely to die of other things."
9985,I'm pretty sure extra will go to mexico and canada first.
9986,"That’s potentially 100,000 more unneeded deaths."
9987,"&gt; it's because your canadian government decided to make foreign workers exempt from travel quarantine

Do you have a source on that?"
9988,"Cause it seems like one of those things that's, you know, not true...

Another explanation for why it's spreading is that it's more easily transmissible, like the UK variant, which is actually spreading even more."
9989,And also they're doing more sequencing.
9990,"According to Søren Brostrøm, who is responsible for the Danish Research Institute (SSI), it has only been removed from the national vaccine program."
9991,You can still get it if your doctor thinks you can tolerate the vaccine.
9992,So I think we will still keep many of them.
9993,"Also, a large portion of them will soon be too old to use."
9994,Damn only 4 hours?
9995,Your nation is insane.
9996,My girlfriend had two days of fever after the vaccine and she get paid leave for three days (counting the day she get the vaccine).
9997,"(still, our vaccine plan sucks)"
9998,"What is really exciting is how much potential this technology has for other diseases, and all the good the giant pile of funding will do for that."
9999,Looks like we're getting an AIDS vaccine out of this.
10000,Maybe treatments for chronic fatigue syndrome.
10001,Even potential for cancer I believe.
10002,Sounds like pretty damn well.
10003,"My strong guess is that will the vaccine doesn't magical prevent any covid virus from entering your system, it lets you kill it before it gets even a toehold."
10004,Which means you never have enough virus in you to be shedding it and transmit.
10005,"So in any useful sense of the words, it prevents both infection and transmission."
10006,"Hey, come on, they are urging patience."
10007,Don’t say they are not doing anything
10008,"&gt; Argentina isn't a third world country

10011,Yup.
10012,"We don't need perfect, we need R &lt; 1."
10013,That's it.

10015,"hear, hear"
10016,"If you got your shot at a pharmacy , we have teams on the back end verifying all uninsured submissions so it's possible that the record will be corrected."
10017,Also you can just ask us what the cost is ?
10018,Lol .
10019,Gratz on your vaxx
10020,The cure for covid the disease?
10021,No.
10022,The cure for covid the pandemic?
10023,Abso-fucking-lutely.
10024,"The mRNA vaccines are effective beyond our wildest dreams, so much better than what we were hoping for."
10025,"Smallpox vaccines left a scar, and polio vaccines paralyzed my grandmother, and still cause outbreaks today."
10026,But they're still good enough to (nearly) eradicate a disease.
10027,"We got incredibly lucky, and people insist on being insanely pessimistic about it."
10028,"It's both incorrect and unhelpful, since it discourages people from getting vaccinated."
10029,Mostly because AZ wasnt delivering the dose that were schedule to the EU while still deliver to other country.
10030,Why not now?
10031,Do you happen to know the 7 day average?
10032,"I mean if you have flu deaths at the same rate as America, then you are currently below deaths per day that your nation would see from a bad flu season."
10033,"So why not open now, considering you would be open with the same amount of people dying from the flu everyday?"
10034,Lots of banks and consulting companies have started travelling already albeit in limited numbers.
10035,Will ramp up massively in May.
10036,Religious people the world over are a special kind of stupid.
10037,Just tell them if they get the vaccines they will get 1000 likes in whatever shitty social network they are
10038,"assumedly that's what ""fully vaccinated"" means."
10039,does your sister have thousands of friends?
10040,It's been apparent since they lied to our faces about masks not working that the entire thing would be bungled.
10041,"Getting it wrong every single time is kind of impressive, you'd have better odds flipping a coin."
10042,"Yes but, I can walk instead of drive."
10043,The same as isolating instead of not isolating.
10044,YOU get vaccinated if YOU need it.
10045,"A young 20 year old with no at risk contacts doesnt need it, and the risk IS NOT COMPARABLE."
10046,Your risk of an average 20's year old of covid death is lower than AZ vaccine.
10047,"Most results are skewed and dont factor age of deaths, their quarantine habits, contacts, and in the UK, ANY death 28 days after a positive result is counted as a covid death... which is asinine."
10048,"If you don't pay taxes and get the vaccine, then it's ""really free"" because your taxes did not pay for it because you didn't pay taxes."
10049,thanks for the anecdote!
10050,&gt; I’m guessing it was just that their immune systems aren’t working at full capacity.
10051,"this is likely, unless they were engaging in other high risk behaviours"
10052,Covid can cause fatalities in children.
10053,"[In Brazil 1,300 babies have died from the virus](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-56696907)."
10054,The new variants can spread to children more easily compared to the original type that was prevalent last year.
10055,But how many did they spread it to?
10056,And that is only comparing cases.
10057,If you look at deaths it's a muchhhh larger difference
10058,Heard that too!
10059,But then I counter with the Pope saying it was OK.
10060,Maybe discuss these things with your doctor instead of reacting to misinformation on Reddit.
10061,"5,158,422 since 2/1

So if all 5,800 infections were since then (some likely before) then 0.11% of all infections were in vaccinated people"
10062,If they’re that loose about it why not just schedule company holiday
10063,We’re in the early stages but it seems promising.
10064,A pill based cure for lung cell fusion caused by the virus would alleviate some of the chronic long term lung damage we see in patients today.
10065,"We’re relying on robotic technology to assume that this drug would work, but I’d love to see some actual clinical trials on patients."
10066,Not trying to be a jerk here.
10067,But at this point would you need to be living under a rock for this to apply to you?
10068,The news is everywhere.
10069,You can’t look at any form of media without an ad blasting you with covid vaccine info.
10070,Are there people out there that solitary?
10071,And it's not FDA approved.
10072,And JnJ just pulled their vaccine because people are dying from it.
10073,It’s not super significant.
10074,Probably just an observation they discovered after the fact
10075,"&gt;I do not see how this is so shocking, controversial, or unexpected

Probably because this is in no way shocking or unexpected."
10076,Controversial is pretty easy to see.

10102,I was looking a little bit for something on medical ethics about this whole thing.
10103,"Like obviously the greater good would be served by vaccinating as many people as possible despite the rare side effects, but the same thing could probably be said for Novavax."
10104,Probably good argument for releasing vaccines that had successful phase 2 trials.

10109,"They may think that it is ""free"" as in they will be billed later or they don't have to pay for the vaccine itself, but they do have to pay for the syringe, doctor/nurse/pharmacist to administer it."

10143,Agreed.
10144,I’m in LA and a lot of the Mexican immigrants in my neighborhood won’t get the vaccine because their church pastor told them it’s made out of aborted babies.
10145,Targeted messaging in every language under the sun is key.
10146,&gt;but providers can bill for the cost of administering the vaccine.
10147,And that cost can't be passed on to you plus they can't charge an office visit fee if that's the only service provided.
10148,It's entirely free and if for some reason you were charged you can get it reimbursed.
10149,&gt;So 10 million people will be getting their vaccine 9-12 days later than they otherwise might have.
10150,"that is absolutely not true.... here in new york... jnj vaccine appointments were cancelled but there are still open modern/pfizer appointments as we speak.... no way it is anything close to 10 million people not getting any kind of vaccine within the next two weeks....

you also realize we are sitting on 30 million oxford vaccines also right?"
10151,are you also advocating that we blow those through the gate and shoot them into the arms of people also?
10152,And in reality florida hasn't really followed rules.
10153,They may as well announce plans to have warm weather next summer.
10154,I'd be equally shocked.
10155,"And now those vaccines are going to the people who would've gotten J&amp;J, when they would've otherwise gone to someone else."
10156,"Look at the numbers - in most of the country, we're still giving out almost all the vaccines we can, almost as fast as we can."
10157,"Despite all the open appointments you mention, New York has still used 83% of the vaccines it's gotten."
10158,"In most places, demand is still high."
10159,"We could've used that increased production to vaccinate still more people; now, we have to use it to backfill for J&amp;J instead."
10160,I know it is frustrating.
10161,But there’s a pause because of the already high anti vaccine sentiment and distrust during a deadly global pandemic.
10162,It’s largely PR because the effects of not addressing it could have a huge impact on people taking vaccines and ending the pandemic.

10170,"You do realize that this isn’t an issue found only in the US, right?"
10171,That every nation deals with this.
10172,"Until we get to 100% vaccinated or whatever the upper ceiling is, we'll never know the ""true"" percentage because the denominator of # vaccinated is constantly changing, as well as the people who were vaccinated and still get covid."
10173,"But I mean c'mon, even if it is 5,800 out of 20 million (which is is not) it is still significantly lower case rate than general non-vaccinated population."
10174,"There have been 77,000 **daily** cases in US, so certainly 5,800 cases out of total vaccinated people is nothing short of a miracle."
10175,"I don't get what the point of searching for the ""number of 'fully vaccinated' people that have been tested for COVID post-vaccination"" is when it's obviously very very good"
10176,"But that's not how this sub works, the hivemind has decided that anything short of saying that the vaccines have solved all our problems is verboten."
10177,"Initially COVID testing was at ""no upfront cost"",  ""no cost at the site"", or ""no cost to you"" which means you definitely will get a bill in the mail some weeks later especially if you don't have insurance."
10178,If there aren't neon signs and bullhorns making it clear it is completely free no catches some people just won't do it.

10182,"In my state, people are becoming less and less compliant by the week."
10183,"All businesses are fully open with no restrictions, offices are reopening, masking and distancing is fading away."
10184,"All the big box stores still require masks, but I expect that will probably only last another couple of months tops."
10185,And then look at Michigan.
10186,"They're in the middle of one of the worst surges seen in this country to date, and they aren't even doing anything to stop it."
10187,The political will is just not there anymore.
10188,"Hell, look at the entire world."
10189,"Cases across the planet have skyrocketed back to roughly tied with their highest point ever, in record time in the past like 8 weeks."
10190,Most places don't even seem to care.
10191,"I swear if an immune-escape variant actually emerged (unlikely as that is), the entire human race would experience a collective mental break and that shit would just rip through unchallenged and take whatever 50 million lives or whatever were projected in the original ""herd immunity"" calculation."
10192,"Luckily, at least in the US, the medical end to the pandemic is hot on the tail of the social end."
10193,It's maybe 8 weeks behind or something.
10194,We could've done a lot worse.
10195,"&gt;there’s a similar problem happening over here in WA where its super easy to find shots everywhere other than seattle, i’m kinda baffled they didn’t factor in more what areas were likeliest to have high uptake rates

I took advantage and drove to ""an area with a low uptake rate"""
10196,"Do we know just how significant, though?"
10197,"Even bearing that in mind, I still see potential for the anti-vaxxers to eventually infect themselves out of being a threat."
10198,The trial didn't do that.
10199,There was an independent study from the CDC stating 80% efficiency &gt;=14 days after 1st shot.
10200,"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7013e3.htm

""Partial immunization (≥14 days after first dose but before second dose) provided preventive benefits with vaccine effectiveness of 80%."
10201,"This finding is similar to an analysis of Phase III trial results (1,2,7) and two other recent estimates of vaccine effectiveness for partial immunization with Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine among health care personnel, including a vaccine effectiveness (≥21 days after first dose) of 72% (95% CI = 58%–86%) against PCR-confirmed infection identified by routine testing in the United Kingdom (4) and a vaccine effectiveness (&gt;14 days after first dose) of 60% (95% CI = 38%–74%) against PCR-confirmed infection identified by records review in Israel (5)."
10202,"This finding is also consistent with early descriptive findings of SARS-CoV-2 employee and clinical testing results by mRNA vaccination status in the United States (8,9)."""
10203,They litterally found one in 40000 got the clots and compared a Mass vaccination of 200k ppl VS how many would die with out.
10204,As denmark got the virus under control and never where hit with the third wave its 5 possible deaths VS 1 death.
10205,I know inasane math.
10206,And it only push the full vaccination program back 2 weeks and restores Faith in the system and vaccine....
10207,Easier to blame other people...

10234,The average IQ is 100.
10235,The other part is a bit facetious.
10236,It is meant to highlight the fact that most people are too dumb to survive without the infrastructure and technology built by a small segment of the present and historical population.
10237,I think it's actually not so bad if you follow precautions.
10238,It's closed on the weekend due to lockdown (except for tourists) so it's a rare opportunity for you to see a busy city like Istanbul totally emptied out.
10239,"You can't eat indoors anyway, and that's where most of the spread is."
10240,"People are definitely getting infected due to gathering indoors, most likely (another reason why lockdowns that force people inside don't make much sense anymore but whatever)."
10241,You can also easily get tested in the airport.
10242,I'm only suggesting this because I met up my boyfriend in Istanbul (we are also long distance and didn't have too many options at the time).
10243,We got tested in and out and were negative...we were also paranoid but pretty much behaved how we would at home anyway...mainly going for walks outside or staying inside...
10244,My daughter is in preschool daily.
10245,I'm way more worried about Covid-19 than I am about a vaccine that's already been very heavily vetted (and they would shut the trial down at the first signs of danger).

10255,"There are certain school districts that are only just now coming back to in-person learning, and that’s not necessarily even five days a week

Many districts have had school closures through the beginning of this year as well

I also just don’t think that “eh we might as well” is a very good argument for keeping covid restrictions for which we know the benefit is marginal, especially by fall

My point is that there is far too much focus on covid restrictions on children that provide little benefit, over the clear and significant harm done by school closures"
10256,I imagine they probably have many meetings about covid even if they arent actually doing anything with covid.
10257,Also increased stress for fear that a patient may be infected but not tested for it yet.

10266,Of course.

10268,Covid is only going to be eradicated when  enough people are vaccinated and follow the guidelines to stop spread.
10269,"yup, this is the real issue (and really has been all along)."
10270,the main point of the restrictions is/was to keep hospitals from getting overwhelmed.
10271,"The good news is that with most older people and those with preexisting conditions now being vaccinated, we theoretically shouldn’t see high hospitalization rates even if cases go up"
10272,"I think it's a combination of vaccines and, unfortunately, the large number of people who got infected over the past year and have now developed immunity."
10273,"Also, I work in the hospital, and the older, more vulnerable people that are likely to require hospitalization if they catch COVID have now largely been vaccinated."
10274,Very few of the younger people who are now catching COVID would likely require hospitalization.
10275,"It looks like COVID has largely run its course through California, of course barring a major mutation that renders the vaccines ineffective."
10276,We've already been gradually opening up for the past month without much increase in cases.
10277,Best of luck with the situation in Canada.
10278,It looks like there's been a big shortage of vaccines for you guys?
10279,You guys do seem to be much better at following social distancing rules than us though.
10280,Is 6ft even meaningful inside of large congregate settings like this?
10281,I'd be curious to see any study one way or another.
10282,Probably not.
10283,If high risk groups get vaccinated like they’re supposed to the vaccine will do it’s thing.
10284,The pandemic is ending.
10285,By the end of this pandemic nobodies going to have intestinal worms anymore!!
10286,!
10287,"Let's assume these 5,800 cases are since 2/1 for this hypothetical:

5,158,422 cases since 2/1

US Population over 18 is: 209,128,094

25,446,405 fully vaccinated March 1st (got at least 1 dose ~2/1)

* 5,800 / 25,446,405 vaccinated people= 0.0228%

183,681,689 unvaccinated march 1

* 5,158,422 cases / 183,681,689 not vaccinated people = 2.81%

So you have a 90% lower chance of getting covid if you have the vaccine."
10288,This has been well documented and reported by Pfizer &amp; Moderna as well.
10289,"Yes the numbers and %'s may fluctuate, but however you look at it they are extremely efficacious"
10290,Hospitalized?

10300,I am very lucky that I have insurance so hopefully it won't be too insane but who knows.
10301,If it is there are payment plans.
10302,Too bad it takes weeks for the vaccines to actually protect people.
10303,It's going to get worse in Michigan before it gets better.
10304,Some of us are going to use this information in all the right ways
10305,"Uh, teachers here?"
10306,Where's your evidence other than your class?
10307,Yeah we have had that discussion but it seems very dangerous over there right now with the spread.
10308,"Personally, I’ve never had an issue with insurance beyond a dispute of a few hundred dollars."
10309,But you’re missing the point.
10310,The whole point of this article is that 7 million Americans believe the vaccine isn’t free.
10311,Are these 7 million people the brightest among us?
10312,Maybe not.
10313,"And yes, I’d classify months of unnecessary stress—especially if you’re recovering from an illness—as getting burnt."
10314,Continuing to spread various strains is still a concern.
10315,Especially because one will eventually mutate to where the vaccines aren't effective.
10316,"Yes, but just today to give some perspective \~0.02% of Americans have tested +ve."
10317,Today.
10318,About 3% of the people who're currently getting vaccinated each day.
10319,"So, a little more than 180,000 people won't be getting shots each day of the pause."
10320,"If they're getting mRNA instead, that means someone else won't be getting that mRNA shot."
10321,There're no free shots; every one would be going to someone.

10343,I used to feel relatively safe when going to the grocery store.
10344,It wasn't as packed with people and everyone who was there was following social distancing and mask orders.
10345,"This past weekend however when I went to the store, it was completely packed with only half the people wearing masks and there was hardly any social distancing."
10346,I ended up walking right back out.
10347,I'll be doing curbside pickup until I am fully vaccinated because grocery stores are officially no longer safe.

10370,"Well the additional part is, there were no hospitalizations or deaths in the vaccinated group."

10400,"I read that was in the trials though, correct?"
10401,And it was at the rate at which is in the general population so they didn't associate any causality.
10402,Was the clots and other blood issues observed in the trial for AZ?
10403,Of course no vaccine is able to be perfectly safe across what will be the vast majority of the world.

10406,"I understand a lot of people don't have that privilege, esp in Europe where the roll out of vaccines has been pretty lackluster to say the least."
10407,They are talking about masking/testing/social distancing even in the FALL semester?
10408,"So even with 8-9 months of vaccinating by the time the school year starts, That wont even be enough to go back to normal?"
10409,SMH This type of messaging is a complete disaster.
10410,Nobody is 100% sure yet what normal is going to look like anyway.
10411,But it will take europe until august at least  to vaccinate about 70% of adults.

10430,"Let's say you socially distance, you quarantine, you do everything right, but then you get ran into by someone is rushing to work and isn't paying attention, also anti-vax and is a carrier."
10431,All of a sudden you catch it and you are unvaccinated against it and you die.
10432,Is the chance of that scenario happening more than 39 in 10 million?
10433,"I would accept the argument that its very rare to the point of being similar, or indistinguishable."
10434,"But now let's think of the other limitless ways your plan could backfire, unsanitary grocery store, family not getting the memo, people not social distancing in public from you (its not all in your control)."
10435,Etc etc.
10436,Would you still argue that the chance of a clot was worth the potential risk of catching covid?
10437,"People are asking you to potentially risk your life to take this vaccine, but that already happens countless times in your every day life."

The list could go on and on and on but the point is, you risk your life for 39 in 10m every day, multiple times, and I will be blunt and honest, it could turn into the biggest and most regrettable mistake of your life not getting this vaccine, even if you think you are doing everything right."
10441,Please re-evaluate.

10443,Just get vaccinated.

10463,The original article quotes Professor Peter Openshaw who sits on Nervtag and is a part of SAGE who agrees that this variant is extremely concerning and also that this outbreak in London of said variant is concerning.
10464,He also said if the variant begins to spread rapidly we may have to reimpose lockdown.
10465,I am merely pointing out that the variant is growing and there isn't really an understanding as to why it's growing.
10466,Whilst levels are low now if the above holds it won't stay that way forever.
10467,There is a theory that it has something to do with the quantity or type of platelets that are produced during the immune system response.
10468,Trust the science here... not sure what you're background but there's nothing risky.

10610,I don’t think he really gave a reason other than he considered it unacceptable.
10611,I haven’t found any data sources showing recovered people who have been vaccinated.
10612,You could crudely estimate that if 10% of the general population has had COVID then 10% of vaccinated population has too.
10613,So 40% with one dose plus 10% recovered is not 50% with protection but very roughly 46%.
10614,It’s also worth considering that it takes 2 weeks for 1st shot to offer some protection so in reality today’s progress towards herd immunity is actually representative of shots given up to March 31st.

10627,Students that were remote but chose to come back full time are like night and day.
10628,[removed]
10629,Of course there will be school.
10630,"But contrary to some people's beliefs, many students do thrive with distance learning and it's only to become more commonplace in the future regardless of pandemics."
10631,Some people learn better independently with instruction from a distance and don't require face to face contact.
10632,Usually these are kids who already have good study habits and are resourceful enough to teach themselves.
10633,Shouldn't be an all or nothing decision.
10634,"For some subjects and for some students, distance learning works well and no reason to abandon it, especially with all the effort done to make it work smoothly."
10635,They are recommending it.
10636,"Unfortunately thanks to Republicans the governor has no legal authority to order that, the state legislature would have to and good luck convincing them to do that."
10637,Politicians don’t always choose the best path.
10638,"A lot of needless deaths will happen due to the governor not being allowed to order another lockdown, but the vaccine will eventually catch up and stop the surge, just not as fast as if there was a lockdown."
10639,"The problem is that kids can still get sick, some will get very sick and a few will die."
10640,What’s the level of avoidable deaths of children that’s acceptable to you?
10641,Is it larger than zero?
10642,Are you willing to say  they don’t have masks because at most only a few kids will die?
10643,"Is that 10 kids, 20 kids, how many need to die before you care?"
10644,Oh yeah that reminded me to go check my statement from my last doc appt.
10645,"Am insured, got standard checkup and follow up labs (I agreed they were necessary)."
10646,That'll be $340.72.
10647,"This is too much, I can't take it LOL"
10648,It’s one or the other.
10649,"You can be at 100% capacity if you can meet social distancing requirements at that capacity....considering that Max Occupancy is usually way past comfortable capacity, they probably should have worded it differently because I seriously doubt there are more than a half full of businesses who’s max occupancy is less than 1 person per six square feet."
10650,Florida never ceases to amaze
10651,"Their death rate is 1,865 per million compared to the US' 1,738 per million."
10652,"Interesting that the UK's case rate of 64,230 is two-thirds of the US' 96,682."

10661,I'm 32 in a Tennessee county that's ahead of the state and I just got my first Pfizer shot.

10671,"I had the first shot at CVS, and even though I stated I had not insurance when I scheduled the appointment online, they still asked me for proof of insurance three times while checking in, despite the day before I stopped by to ask and they told me that if I had not insurance then it'd be covered by some federal program."
10672,But honestly I'm expecting that some sort of bill will show up by mail at some point in the near future.
10673,Gotta love overblown politics on something.
10674,When almost everything you can take over the counter has a higher bloody risk.
10675,This is literally why I have been afraid to look into it.
10676,I no longer have insurance and my money is running out quick.
10677,I didn't even want to think about medical expenses eating up the last bit of money I have.
10678,Hopefully my business takes off.
10679,"He was talking to the majority of people, not ONLY vaccinated people."
10680,"He DID NOT EXPLICITLY SAY ""vaccinated people should not dine indoors."""
10681,Do they not teach critical reading and writing anymore?
10682,?

10688,[deleted]
10689,We can thank the for profit system for that.
10690,The cdc is recommending lockdown
10691,GASLIGHTING???
10692,"You've immedietly lost any sort of argument you wanted to make considering you don't know how to use the word gaslighting

Pointing out how words can be twisted to form an agenda and bits and pieces can be taken apart and put back together is not GASLIGHTING."
10693,[deleted]
10694,Where has the CDC said that vaccines won’t eventually stop the spread?
10695,"That highly depends on the age group, though, and also just generally isn't true in the numbers you state, from what I have read."
10696,[This is from the 'low exposure' scenario of infographic being circulated by the UK](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d135842e29bf8c89d1c5bbbe08e89c114d3c0cac/0_0_1896_1054/master/1896.jpg?width=465&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=c835bed41f3b1b489c63bf3e15497732).
10697,"It's estimated that you prevent about 70x as many COVID ICU admissions as you get serious side effects for AZ in the 60-69 age category, but that drops to 0.7 ICU admissions prevented per case of serious side effects, in the 20-29 age group."
10698,"So there do certainly seem to be subsets of people for whom giving the AZ vaccine appears more likely to cause harm, than prevent harm."
10699,That's why the UK is being so cautious about giving this vaccine to the younger age group.
10700,I mean indoor dining never closed where I lived but I’m definitely eating in when we’re both vaccinated.
10701,"Lives could just as easily be saved as a result of this, if AZ and J&amp;J doses now go to older people in poor countries that need them instead of young people in rich countries that are just waiting an extra month for more expensive vaccines."
10702,Had an allergist send some labs off to check to make sure my hives weren't something more serious.
10703,"Got an $800 dollar bill from University of Nebraska, which was odd as I've never even been to Nebraska."
10704,Call up insurance and literally got talked down to by the rep because it's apparently my responsibility to make sure lab tests stay in network???
10705,And that it's my fault for not asking since my doctor didn't have signs posted about where they send labs to???
10706,I told them to shove that right up their butts.
10707,Insurance will look for ANY excuse to not pay.
10708,I work in healthcare and the amount of time I've had to spend defending why they actually should pay me for my services makes me want to gag.
10709,I didn't go to school for 6 years just to have to explain to someone not in my field why I should be paid.
10710,"If this pandemic doesn't wake people up to the nightmare of American healthcare, I don't know what will."
10711,Many Native Americans still don't have running water and electricity in the U.S.A!
10712,Do people not read the news...
10713,Turns out you had to protect at risk individuals all along.
10714,"It’s been 10 hours since I got the shot and so far, so good!"
10715,"Had a SUPER sore arm after the first, super hard to lift it up (probably would’ve taken ibuprofen but I just didn’t think of it) and this time a very mild soreness, less than my flu shot soreness."
10716,We’ll see what hits in the morning.
10717,"(19 y/o and female, never had COVID to my knowledge)"
10718,Clearly you think you are smarter than the experts at the cdc
10719,How is this anti vaxx?
10720,"I have my second shot in a week, Jesus"
10721,For Florida?
10722,Going up 3 weeks in a row.
10723,Next question?
10724,"There's a ""you get what you pay for"" mindset at work."
10725,"""If it's so great why can't they charge for it?"""
10726,"&gt;you probably already had covid without realising it

Can you back this ad hoc hypothesis up?"
10727,We don't need to shut down literally every person who has a bad experience with a vaccine.
10728,Sometimes they hurt and that's fine.
10729,This is crazy.
10730,Canada has public and private (or employer) insurance.
10731,"Public covers hospitals (less nightly fee of like $100), and doctors, etc."
10732,"Private covers prescriptions, hearing aids, glasses etc.."
10733,I don’t understand why people are so determined to separate the two.
10734,"UK has 66 million and today had 2,491 cases."
10735,Now THAT is a success story.
10736,See it’s weird because I totally buy these figures.
10737,But I was having some trouble squaring away that the resistant Republican demographics tend to skew older and that the 65+ Age demo is going to cross 80% vaxxed soon.
10738,I was thinking that some people are saying “No” to pollsters but quietly getting vaxxed anyway.
10739,I guess one can only hope.
10740,"This is the right choice in a broad sense, but god the optics of sending a vaccine we think isn't safe enough for us to less wealthy countries are really, really bad."
10741,Will COVID19 likely mutate to a less destructive endemic form?
10742,Ahh.
10743,Well my bad then.
10744,"I still wish OP would look this up and find the information from a reputable source and not rely on Reddit for any medical advice, straightforward or not."
10745,[deleted]
10746,"I mean I'm in favor of the idea in concept, like there are certain times and places where it would be good to know if people are vaccinated (not sure if a concert is one of them)."
10747,"But how can you college and store a unique identifier, someone's name, age, and vaccination status, in a way that is easy to collect and store and share with an app but is also secure, across state lines?"
10748,The world has never seen such a thing.
10749,Yeah those are notorious for not working correctly.
10750,No human should have a temp that low.
10751,Anything below 95 is hypothermic.
10752,What about if you're an expat coming back to the country and don't have a permanent address yet?
10753,I have made it quite clear I am speaking for myself and that my situation allows for some delay.
10754,You clearly have issues with something else.
10755,Pursue those instead of projecting them onto me.
10756,I haven’t said anything that the CDC hasn’t implied over the past couple days.
10757,Take it up with them.
10758,Nope.
10759,"Lol not even close to what I said my bad hombre 

Because if there are 100 people and 50 people don’t have access to healthcare,  45 people have access to okay healthcare, and 5 people have amazing healthcare."
10760,It’s objectively better for society for 100 to have access to healthcare and those 5 people to go from amazing healthcare to okay healthcare.
10761,"If I lower taxes, it’s going to hurt someone."
10762,"If I keep taxes the same, it will hurt someone."
10763,"If I raise taxes, I will hurt someone."
10764,Losing weight is calories in calories out.
10765,This has been shown to be true for decades.
10766,Metabolic damage is also still unproven and from the research that is available seems easy to recover from (if it is true).
10767,The guy who popularized “metabolic damage” admits there is no proof for it but was something he thinks he observed in figure competitors who dieted down to extreme levels for competition.
10768,Obese/overweight individuals are not in “danger” of metabolic damage or the misaligned starvation mode.
10769,In less than two weeks Michigan has jumped from 42nd to 40th for cases per million.
10770,They'll probably be 38th by Friday.
10771,Dont bother.
10772,This person is not arguing in good faith.
10773,Probably a healthcare industry lobbyist who'd be looking for a new job if universal healthcare ever becomes a reality.
10774,The idea being that the risk of a blood clot is lower than a risk of serious or fatal COVID for ppl in their 20s
10775,"My Mum caught coronavirus last year in April, she still can’t taste things properly, a lot of tastes have changed for her (seems permanent) - peppers taste like perfume, for example."
10776,Whitmer needs to restrict access to the lawn and garden sections of home improvement stores as she did last April.
10777,That stopped the spread of the virus last year.
10778,"Actually Loudoun, Dulles Town Center on route 7 15 miles East of Arlington."
10779,Same story though.
10780,That's assuming vaccine demand stays steady.
10781,"Expect a drop-off at some point, then we'll have the challenging task of getting the lazy and/or vaccine hesitant vaccinated."
10782,"Well, when I went to my state's health department website to sign up for the vaccine, the form asked how I was paying for it (cash/insurance)."
10783,"It ended up being free, but it surprised me because I knew it was free."
10784,Charge more.
10785,Those that want these flights pay more.
10786,See how the market shakes out
10787,"J &amp; J has been paused in the US because of a small number of aparently similar clotting events, while nothing similar has been reported for Moderna or Pfizer."
10788,So it's not looking great for the adenovirus vaccines in general :/
10789,I actually never heard that it was free.
10790,No one told me it was.
10791,Nobody is saying these things.
10792,Stop projecting
10793,You aren’t even tracking my point.
10794,Just going on some irrelevant rant.
10795,The issue is of such great concern that the CDC feels the need to hit the pause button.
10796,"Nonetheless, the mRNA vaccines are excellent."
10797,I will be getting one when it’s made available to me.
10798,Congratulations on the long post about nothing relevant though.
10799,"If your point requires that many metaphors, maybe the issue is that you don’t understand the actual point."
10800,Which you would if you had been following these comments correctly.
10801,Take it up with the CDC if you want.
10802,"Couldn't find any source on your ratio of cases caused by schools, care to share it?"
10803,What would be an acceptable ratio for you?
10804,It can't be 0 of course and it might have been a lot higher without all the precautions taken.
10805,I really doubt we get much higher average than we do now.
10806,"We might have a few days higher but throughout most of the country, you are able to get same day shots."
10807,"We will hit demand problems really soon, we may already have hit them."
10808,Birth control is used for treatment of all sorts of menstrual issues.
10809,It's pretty frustrating to me that society has decided that this treatment that is legitimately pretty dangerous is fine for women and we don't seek out other treatments for issues that can be debilitating.
10810,No this is a common misconception.
10811,The CDC has lumped the guidance for Pfizer and Moderna together.
10812,"In the clinical trial, the effectiveness for Pfizer was tested at 7-days and Moderna was tested at 14 days."
10813,Some other countries unclumped this misconception.
10814,So it’s 7 days after second dose of Pfizer but still 14 days after Moderna.
10815,"It's not a different brand, it's a different product."
10816,"I think people are overreacting to the blood clots but it's not a matter of snobbery, which seems to be what you're implying."
10817,I live in the southern U.S. and we're about to see supply exceed demand.
10818,I don't think excess demand for a particular vaccine is really the nightmare scenario here.
10819,"Well, I live in the UK and I can tell you there wasn't much of a lockdown in reality."
10820,All schools opened early March too and there's been no uptick in cases a month later.
10821,"Israel has only got really low case numbers since mid-march, and they are not significantly better than UK (relative to nearly 7 times the population), and that has required a really huge 2-dose vaccination rollout compared to the UK prioritising 1-dose."
10822,"Also, if the recent publication suggesting Pfizer vaccine only generates one third of T-cells compared to AZ are proved correct then that would worryingly suggest that protection from Pfizer will decay much faster than AZ and revaccination will be necessary more often."
10823,"Considering Pfizer is almost 6 time more expensive than AZ and requires expensive storage and handling facilities, that would not be good."
10824,"First mini horses, now this."
10825,Once I get a vaccine I'm going back to normal.
10826,This is the end point.
10827,The whole point of all of this was to limit hospitalisations and deaths.
10828,Getting a vaccine does that.
10829,"Agreed

Let people see the current and assess their own risks."
10830,Some people are way too at risk to catch Covid and die then what appears to be an exponentially less risk of dying from a vaccine.
10831,Did people actually think that the official covid cases were even close to the real count?
10832,I wouldn't be even a little bit surprised if 400 or 500+ million people on India have covid antibodies.
10833,Oh yess.
10834,The same attitude of “how come you get paid so much?” When in reality.
10835,"I should not have to put $60,000 (or far more) into education to look for a job with a better wage."
10836,Why isn't more being done to help spread the word that it's free?
10837,Bit dramatic don't you think?
10838,Woo!
10839,"I finally get to add to the count (I guess technically tomorrow's list, but whatever.)"
10840,Got Moderna at the Indy Motor Speedway today.
10841,"Great view while getting a vaccine, and the entire operation was super efficient and well run."
10842,25 minutes from the time I pulled into the track until I pulled out.
10843,"Super sore arm/shoulder and some chills this evening, but all and all not too bad."
10844,I got my vaccine through a middle school.
10845,They didn't ask for anything but my name.
10846,So yeah no payments even my insurance wasn't looked at.
10847,The article starts off with a hypothetical and the entire article is based off that hypothetical
10848,Exactly.
10849,Everyone denying this is just living with their head in the sand.
10850,"If you’re at risk you should get the vaccine, if you’re young and healthy there’s really no point."
10851,Downvote away.
10852,Not when you’re sitting on the ground at the gate and you’re cooking to death because the AC isn’t running.
10853,"That has nothing to do with the video itself LMAOO


You haven't watched it?"
10854,"Like u/ridgegirl29 said

&gt;Its a 15 second twitter interview!"
10855,"1% of all Corona straints in Germany are SA variant, 90% is british variant."
10856,This fact makes it a bit more concerning.
10857,“Vaccines are safe and effective”.
10858,Facebook and Instagram fact checkers should be sued
10859,I have my shots and I go to dinner and bars whenever the fuck I want.
10860,Join the club.
10861,Enjoy your life and the fact that we are in the position to do so.
10862,Perhaps you should read the article first.
10863,Evidence of more mutations has already been established.
10864,Just a matter of time for the virus to mutate into COVID-21.
10865,I got my first shot 2 weeks ago.
10866,Before I signed up I had no idea it was free.
10867,Only found out because I was looking up prices(I have no insurance)
10868,I'd imagine the entire purpose of this pause to decide just who that at risk group is.
10869,"Yea I get it man, thanks, I didn’t read your comment in a bitchy way don’t worry, I also didn’t mean my comment in a bitchy way lol"
10870,The problem is that the level of risk is not being put into context.
10871,The American Academy of Pediatrics reports that “0.00%-0.03% of all child COVID-19 cases resulted in death” (source https://services.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/children-and-covid-19-state-level-data-report/).
10872,We will NEVER reach a point where we are 100% certain that no kid will die of covid.
10873,"But even now, before the majority of the population in the US is vaccinated, the chance of death for a child that contracted covid-19 is literally near zero."
10874,Any additional benefit from making kids wear masks would also be near zero because the risk is so low to begin with.
10875,"I mean, do you just straight up not believe the mortality statistics for covid in children?"
10876,"Like, do you think the American Academy of Pediatrics is just making this up?"
10877,Sorry the facts don’t fit your fantasy.
10878,I have still not heard one good reason why we should be forcing kids to wear masks in school in the fall
10879,"It is better for providers as well and not just from a paperwork stand point, fighting to get paid sucks."
10880,"Early in the pandemic, I remember epidemiologists characterizing covid as being ""not used"" to humans, that it was too strong for its own good, and would eventually become something less dangerous as it mutated."
10881,"I never saw anything more official than that, than a few experts suggesting it would get less harmful in time."
10882,But they seemed to correlate a coronavirus's maturity with being less destructive.
10883,Men have to work longer hours.
10884,Anti British sentiment.
10885,Its stunk of it from the start.
10886,80 percent after 2 weeks.
10887,Canada only doing 55+ with it too.
10888,It's frustrating.
10889,I'm 37 i'll take anything just fucking gimme something i want to leave the house.
10890,"It's authorized for all ages, but most provinces are only giving it to 55+ because the national advisory is for 55+ only."
10891,"Yes, free to everyone is the law."
10892,"If their system doesn’t allow it, just give them a fake address or something."
10893,Ugh same in Chile.
10894,We had around 2k cases daily (national population of 18m) in December ish.
10895,Then everything opened up for the summer months (December - March) and vaccination began in February so things seemed to going very well and suddenly we now have 9k cases daily and the vaccine has been proven to be only 50% effective at preventing infection.
10896,We have more daily cases than we did on this day a year ago.
10897,Well that’s the beauty of having a nuanced take is you would still issue a pause for at risk people.
10898,"And we call those people ""idiots""."
10899,It's all advertised as being free
10900,I’ve never related to a comment more.
10901,"Today I watched the SAG awards from a few days back and was like, “really, they’re doing a zoom thing again?” Why can they do the Grammys outside but nothing else?"
10902,Give us some sense of hope/normalcy.
10903,"Today, the Stanford health Vaccination clinic was a mess."
10904,Crowded lines inside the building starting from the fourth floor working down the stairs.
10905,No temp checks or sanitizers.
10906,2 hours to get through the appointment while the vaccine part of the process took only minutes.
10907,The rest of the time was validating paperwork and taking insurance info.
10908,"They made it come across as, there is no cost for the vaccine but there is an 80 dollar administration fee charged to insurance."
10909,"Horrible bedside manner, way too long spent holding people in a tight space so their insurance could be collected and billed too, while all their other info had been collected well in advance."
10910,I'm sure that people would be scared away by the poor communication.
10911,It freaked my family out and we have insurance and could pay the cost if we had known we were expected to.
10912,The posting on their website describes it only slightly better by elaborating that its insurance or the government being billed.
10913,it wasn't announced anywhere vibrantly during the registration and appointment process but wow was money the focus today.
10914,It was way weird especially in contrast to my experience going to Sutters' drive through clinic where I was a respected human being from start to finish.
10915,Everyone should be comfortable going to get their vaccine but im certain many will be scared off by treatment like that.
10916,"Yeah I get it, can get in the weeds."
10917,Not trying to be contradictory just pointing it out I guess.
10918,"  As someone who has lived on both sides of the boarder, I'll take the Canadian system."
10919,My mother had to wait for operations in Missouri as well.
10920,Canada has its issues but many of them are related to Rural medicine and that is an issue everywhere.
10921,I trust BCBS about as much as I trust Charter/Spectrum.
10922,I work in healthcare.
10923,I understand that the state is covering administration costs for the uninsured and insurance is supposed to cover it for their customers.
10924,But I got my first dose in January.
10925,That’s a brand new $8k deductible!
10926,I marked uninsured because I was afraid that there would be some kind of exclusion or billing error.
10927,I kept thinking that I might “accidentally” be billed some absurd amount since I haven’t met my deductible.
10928,"I don’t have time to spend hours dealing with phone calls, appeals, and ultimately being wrongly sent to collections."
10929,Sorry for sending you the bill California.
10930,If you don’t like it then you should regulating the insurance industry instead of allowing these companies to traumatize us all.
10931,Thanks!
10932,I just discovered a gov site so I could get on more waiting lists — the ones I was using were just for pharmacy appointments.
10933,Fingers crossed!
10934,"But the weather is so nice, a road trip also sounds great :)"
10935,So far the data isn't showing that it is more lethal but it is much more infectious overwhelming the health care system by sheer number of cases.
10936,You gave the same advice a doctor would have given him.
10937,And he could have easily died from COVID or have had a stroke from COVID.
10938,"On top of that, there are ***a lot*** of people getting vaccinated right now."
10939,"The odds of that number overlapping with the number of people who were going to have a stroke this week anyway, regardless of vaccination status, are extremely high."
10940,Don't stress it man.
10941,You absolutely made the right call.
10942,"Arguably another issue is that healthcare is so consistently expansive in the US that even when it’s free, people would never naturally come to that conclusion on their own."
10943,America #1!
10944,"Listen dude, it's a temporary pause to figure out the path forward on a vaccine because an otherwise healthy young woman died from it."
10945,"These stats aren't just numbers, they are people...  have some fucking respect."
10946,[removed]
10947,Literally a scam.
10948,You have to risk your life in the military in order to get healthcare.
10949,In what world is that not a scam?
10950,!
10951,What do you mean?
10952,That's physically impossible.
10953,If social distancing is enforced then it's not 100% capacity.
10954,Not now.
10955,But very soon.
10956,Like before June I'd bet.

10958,"Anecdotally, in my experience, women are more likely to be anti-vaxxers than men."
10959,"An otherwise healthy 25 year old man experienced it as well following the J&amp;J vaccine, so it looks like it’s not just women (although they’re in the majority)."
10960,How about get vaccinated.
10961,"I heard that reduces the shit out of the risk

No vaccine... no boarding card."
10962,"Yes, but it’s not a scam."
10963,The federal government provides [better care](https://www.rand.org/news/press/2018/04/26.html) than the private sector.
10964,It’s a better model for reforming national healthcare than public insurance.
10965,"Oh and they’re also vaccinating spouses and caregivers, because of a recent change in the law"
10966,Nothing is free
10967,"Almost 50% of the 18+ population has received at least one dose, but only 37.3% of the total population has, according to the CDC website."
10968,[deleted]
10969,20 out of how many?
10970,Nobody ever said the vaccine was 100% effective.
10971,Other studies have shown vaccines offer protection against the SA variant.
10972,It also has to be acknowledged that one dose of Pfizer  or Moderna is also an option.
10973,"Sure the ideal is 2, but many other countries are either doing only one shot or delaying the second shot 12 weeks like the UK or up to 4 months like Canada."
10974,If you’re really in the small percent of population that can’t get 2 shots and can’t get J&amp;J it should be really suggested as a 1-dose alternative for those groups.
10975,Are there concrete numbers yet in regards to how much protection you get after one dose of the Pfizer vaccine?
10976,That's a very small amount of Americans.
10977,"This right here should be an incentive to get vaccinated though unfortunately, at least in the USA, those who refuse often don't care too much about the environment."
10978,I got Moderna at the Etihad on Wed morning too.
10979,"Took the opportunity to get a McDonald's breakfast and a mooch round the big Asda, obvs."
10980,Good point.
10981,Hold my beer and watch this?
10982,Ignorance.
10983,"It's not about socializing or not, it's about how to learn most effectively with the technologies all kids are going to have to use now and in the future."
10984,"It's 2021, not 1930."
10985,Can't expect schools to look the same.
10986,"There are other significant factors contributing to blood clots in women, like taking birth control, calcium supplements and other medications."
10987,Covid is not the first thing to spread person to person on an aircraft.
10988,But it definitely seems like it’s the first thing that people feel you should just shut down air travel for.
10989,Don’t want covid?
10990,Or cold?
10991,Or flu?
10992,Don’t fly.
10993,"Not sure what else to tell you, but the rest of us will be flying around having a blast without you."
10994,What about sex?
10995,I don't think you understood what I was saying at all.
10996,"Hard to explain since you're not a New Yorker but rest assured if an establishment in New York is using the excelsior pass, you can present your CDC vaccine card as well."
10997,I know from experience.
10998,Dont you have to be a vet to go to the VA?
10999,As a non American are other vaccines not free in the US?
11000,Like if I lived in the states and wanted my child to get the Polio Vaccine would I have to pay for that?
11001,Massive eye roll
11002,"Right, my county health department bills insurance for your COVID test if you're insured, but use a state grant to cover the cost if your not insured."
11003,"Doing it that way means they can provide more tests, but the individual getting the tested will never be expected to pay out of pocket for it."
11004,Yeah honestly I understand how tough it is for the kids if we close our schools.
11005,If their goal is to keep the schools open I think we need to accept the fact that cases will inevitably go up at some point and there’s not much we can do about it.
11006,I’m not a big fan of the 9:30pm curfew but I could live with it.
11007,"However, 8pm in mid april is just too much for me."
11008,"My cousin, when we tried to get him to take the vaccine, started spouting You-Know-Who's talking points."
11009,That man and that party is already responsible for so many deaths and will be responsible for more.
11010,I went for my birthday in February and it was awesome and that was like mild crowds.
11011,Have a blast.
11012,My 100 years old granduncle got AZ vaccine and had no side effects.
11013,I’m from South America so I don’t really know how you guys are doing over there.
11014,"But I just read a comment that said you were effectively in lockdown, why are schools open then?"
11015,What’s the rationale if parents are working from home I assume?
11016,"""Virus may become something"" Why the fuck is this an article"
11017,&gt;	I find every part of the US healthcare system a scam.
11018,Dont get me wrong the canadian system isnt perfect we need to fund it better.
11019,But I've never waited for anything and never spent a dime other than parking.
11020,"The VA is not a scam and if your income is low enough, they actually pay transportation costs too."
11021,I don't blame them.
11022,That's because nothing about Healthcare is usually free in this over priced country.
11023,Shocker.
11024,As if history doesn’t repeat itself.
11025,Right.
11026,"While I don’t get why everyone is so butthurt about wearing masks, if the goal is for 0 children to die we should definitely mask up for the flu, ban bike riding, ban school sports, ban pools etc."
11027,Only if we prevent the conservatives from carrying out their voter suppression.
11028,We are only at the top of the 4th inning.
11029,Covid restricting aren't going away for another year at least
11030,"The other people say because of Bolsonaro but that is just half (or even less) the answer, Brazil is a really big country, and not a rich one like the USA, tens of millions of Brazilians live day to day and NEED to go outside to work or else they'll literally starve to death, this is one of the reasons Mexico never went into lockdown as well."
11031,"Going into lockdown on a poor country ain't easy, look at cases in India, they've increased 1200% in about 2 months, yet they can't go into lockdown, it's just not possible."
11032,No it's a complete waste of resources.
11033,Kids can home school if they are scared of being around other children.
11034,Really well said 👏
11035,You think a priority for men wouldn't be called out as sexism.
11036,Similarly if we find out that J&amp;J is indeed unsafe for women it would be part of the sexism against women.
11037,"For clarification I am not MGTOW, I am gay."
11038,The side effects of the AZ vaccine were severely downplayed in my country (a family friend was told by the doctor that there's only a slim chance of high body temperature and nothing else) and it's my opinion that they're still being downplayed.
11039,When there are alternative vaccines any loss of life is not acceptable (imo).
11040,Our government bought mostly AZ due to the much lower price and vaccinated (it was optional but there certainly were pressures for them to get it) government workers with it.
11041,"It's different from country to country but AZ was and still is ""good enough"" for the general public, with certain sectors (teachers, etc.)"
11042,being pressured to vaccinate.
11043,"Highly likely only because the vaccine is cheaper than Moderna with the availability being the second, less important, factor."
11044,"At the end of the day anyone can decide for themselves to get it or not, let's just not downplay the negative effects by laser focusing on the ""the greater good"" angle."
11045,Already there in much of the country.
11046,May 31st.
11047,Plenty of time for full immunity to kick in for everyone that wants it.
11048,"One of those corporate labs had the gall to actually send me a bill for ""lab services"" for a preemployment drug screen."
11049,"Ya, that bill went went straight in the shredder."
11050,"They are worried that, yes, the vaccine is free."
11051,"But it's $30 for the alcohol swab, $500 for the syringe, and $40 for the band aid afterward."
11052,The lack of quality public messaging and quality PR in attacking/testing covid and taking the vaccine started terribly with Trump but hasn’t honestly gotten a whole shit ton better under Biden.
11053,It’s frustrating.
11054,"I think there are a lot of factors at work, including the unfortunate American obsession with everything being controlled and administered at the state and local level, preventing a one-stop, universally true FAQ on where to go, who is eligible, cost, etc."
11055,"Ideally there would be a simple federal website, QR code’s everywhere, a simple three digit (ala 911) hotline people could call, etc."
11056,as well as clever incentives to get vaxxed.
11057,"I saw anti-vax propaganda on a bittorrent search site, of all places."
11058,It made me angry especially as I wasn't expecting that crap to show up there of all places.
11059,Thankfully none of the residents actually were sick.
11060,Who cares?
11061,Some people definitely like to keep up a persona that aligns with their political beliefs.
11062,"I constantly overhear my coworker talking about conspiracy theories and stolen elections to other people of similar beliefs, yet he told me he was looking for a vaccine appointment a few days ago."
11063,Here I thought he would want a bleach or light injection instead.
11064,🤷‍♂️
11065,Wow the government needs to blame from the mountains that the shot is free!!
11066,!
11067,Yeah.
11068,We just have the highest case load per capita in the EU currently.
11069,You ok with people dying because they're overreacting to 6 cases of a side effect?
11070,"I think you guys aren't getting the issue.. People can avoid dying by not getting covid, or even with getting covid, without a vaccine

You are acting like people are gonna make some noble sacrifice to line up to have a chance to die.. lol

People do not want to die, regardless of whom else their deaths may save."
11071,"If everything gets completely opened, no masks or anything, why are you assuming that kids won’t see an enormous jump in infections?"
11072,We have to ease into this until kids can get vaccinated.
11073,I’m not calling for anymore shutdowns but we can easily continue to wear masks and avoid high risk situations like concerts and crowded bars.
11074,“If all your customers die”?
11075,“If 30 percent of your students die”?
11076,*rolls eyes so hard they fall out of my head*
11077,Are you saying that we do not have data to say that kids are at extremely low risk of serious illness from covid to begin with?
11078,"Like, do you think the data doesn’t exist?"
11079,Or has been fabricated?
11080,Really unclear
11081,"I highly doubt the average parent is going to be of much help, they don't neccessarily know much more if anything about the risks either or are any guarentee of making sure the teen gets the information they need."
11082,"Education in school health or whatever classes on this topic is important, and quite possibly some education and enforcement of making sure doctors and pharmacists properly educate girls and young women properly on the risks."
11083,"i agree idk if we’ll ever get to 85. my questions is ok if we stall out at 75 and cases are pretty low, no risks of hospitalizations breaking the system, deaths low.are we going to keep things in place hoping that 10% change their mind, force them to do it (highly unlikely), or say well they had their chance and overall at this point cons of restrictions outweigh the risks"
11084,There will be no bill.
11085,The vaccine is free for you.
11086,"They want insurance info to file with insurance companies to cover the administration, otherwise it is covered by the CARES act."
11087,"If you receive a bill from the pharmacy for the covid vaccine, then they are violating federal law."
11088,I doubt CVS would do that.
11089,I got lost on all the arguments today.
11090,One was about mandatory vaccinations.
11091,I give up.
11092,Lol
11093,Are you sure it’s not men mansplaining if we are ok with birth control pills we should also be ok with these vaccines’ side effects?
11094,"It has that, “you’ve ignored that risk to be a bad girl, now be a good girl and do as I say” feeling."
11095,Almost all large commercial jets* do recirculate air in meaningful volumes and do run through HEPA filters.
11096,Usually a 50/50 or so mix.
11097,It helps keep the already low humidity from dropping to absolutely ridiculously low proportions.
11098,Composite planes like the 787 can actually have very high recirc mix (higher than 50/50) because they keep humidity relatively high (for airplanes at least).
11099,That humidity comes entirely from folk's breath.
11100,This is doubly so in low passenger count flights (the pax count is actually used by the circ system to estimate mix to keep humidity right).
11101,"Now, of course, every time the air recirculates, it reduces the proportion of ""twice recirculated air"" by about half."
11102,"But plenty of air lives multiple ""generations"" through this cycle."
11103,HEPA is not a buzzword on a plane.
11104,"HEPA might be overkill, but I don't want unfiltered recirculated air blasting in my face."
11105,"*Some smaller regional jets (e.g., CRJ200s) do not use HEPA filters."
11106,All air from vents is brought in from outside and none is recirculated.
11107,They(CVS) billed my insurance.
11108,I believe policy are different from state to state and site to site.
11109,I think it is they do not bill the cost shot but they sure can bill the labor to give you the shot.
11110,"I took my wife to the city’s massive site they did not ask for anything other than ID

Edit: CVS billed $28.93 ICD10: Z23 CPT:0031A"
11111,personally i've gotten fatter but good for you.
11112,40 million might not get it even if you paid them
11113,I thought usa was one of the countries that didnt allow you to be a dual citizen?
11114,Maybe I'm misinformed.
11115,I'm UK/Aus citizen.
11116,And how many kids have been infected so far?
11117,If everyone declares the pandemic over and lets the virus run free then how many will be infected then?
11118,"How many more deaths and hospitalizations, MIS-C and yes, long term effects too."
11119,we deserve the next pandemic
11120,The covid vaccine is free.
11121,Covid is not.
11122,Go get vaccinated.
11123,"You are not required to have insurance to get the vaccine, it’s free for you under the CARES act."
11124,Sounds about right.
11125,"I'm lucky I have it with work, but the sign up process made it seem like if I didn't have insurance I would be paying something out of pocket."
11126,Got mine as CVS.
11127,This is what happens when you go to school for a literature degree and never really have to solve problems.
11128,"Your knee jerk reaction is to simply say “well those people shouldn’t have that anyway.”

As intellectual as you think you are your thought process is incredibly shallow."
11129,Instead of rolling your eyes maybe pay someone’s medical bills?
11130,Do you need health insurance to get it for free?
11131,"Pfizer is 3 weeks, AZ is 12."
11132,"Some others are different as well, I just rounded up since we can’t discuss second doses until everyone, including the slowest, gets the second dose."
11133,"Also, priorities I guess."
11134,"The question is that, if first doses allow for adequate interim protection, then we can stretch the second dose (from 8 to 12 weeks) since it’s maybe safer to have 2x people have one dose in 3 months than just 1x having two doses."
11135,"Yeah, I know it’s not 2x precisely, it depends on rollout but you get the idea."
11136,So it’s still worth looking into as a possibility.
11137,I would still be cautious.
11138,"On the covid positive sub, a number of people reported getting covid twice and the second time the symptoms were more severe."
11139,I would just expect some red tape to bill me somehow/ some way.
11140,Was amazed it was *actually free* when i got mine.
11141,"I was thinking the same thing, 7M is really small but everyone should know either way."
11142,"Sounds like maybe kids should never ride in a car or bus, or walk, to get to or from school."
11143,Or swim.
11144,Or ride a bike.
11145,A non-zero number of them will die in accidents every year.
11146,How many need to die before you care?!?!
11147,?11!
11148,"Yes, it’s free."
11149,"14,500 is about 25% of flu deaths per year (‘19-‘20 season, per CDC)."
11150,"So like I said in another post, are you going to worry about your neighbors getting the flu shot every year?"
11151,Because it is about 4x as deadly as COVID in (Covid) vaccinated individuals.
11152,"Im not saying any of this doesn’t matter, I’m saying once you’re vaccinated there’s no reason to worry about what someone down the street is doing."
11153,This all started with a Disney World argument.
11154,"If you get the vaccine, go to Disney and live your life happily finally and forget about the pandemic."
11155,"i hope that they don't get it, because I want to keep the mask mandates permanantely, because it's better to just wear a mask so i don't have to put on makeup"
11156,Idiot.
11157,Seriously.
11158,They bill the insurance company for the administration of the shot.
11159,Insurance companies must cover it as it’s preventative care.
11160,i’m also confused as to why he says july 4th we should be able to have “small gatherings”.idk if we’re 75%+ vaccinated by then i don’t see why we couldn’t have full blown normal fourth of july with concerts and full baseball stadiums and packed bars
11161,People like that are spineless cowards and should be reminded of that fact every day for the rest of their lives.
11162,Distance learning isn't going anywhere.
11163,Not now.
11164,So better find some babysitters for your kids other than public school teachers.
11165,I went to a state run site for my vaccine (NY) and they didn’t even collect my insurance info.
11166,Don’t sweat it!
11167,That’s a violation of federal law.
11168,This is a great point.
11169,[removed]
11170,Oh I see what you’re saying.
11171,Good to know that’s the case in NYC.
11172,Ought to be the case in Erie county.
11173,Where I’m from.
11174,"This is still being studied, but currently it seems to be a low risk"
11175,"&gt; Been 6+ years without paying, somehow hasn't dinged my credit score yet."
11176,"I could be wrong, but I don't think medical debts that are sent to collections get reported to the credit agencies."
11177,At least that's what I was told when a hospital fucked up one of my bills and incorrectly sent it to collections while I was disputing it.

11184,"If they ask you for the payment of an administration fee, decline it."

11213,everyone seems to automatically assume it’s lack of demand cause it’s a very conservative state but idk based on my experience it seems like it’s more the administration of it than the demand

11231,"It took a bit of reading to understand they are free even without insurance, which in hindsight makes most sense, they federal government did purchase them for that reason"
11232,If you know people are going to die from covid if you don’t act then are you not knowingly and intentionally letting them die I.e killing them?
11233,[removed]
11234,TIL the Covid vaccine is free
11235,It's Xoom not Zoom I believe.
11236,The classes that are being run on xoom on a daily basis are the ones that should be held in person.
11237,That's why schools will be open.
11238,1.
11239,I don’t think death is the only silent measure.
11240,It’s reductive and ignores the impact of serious illness and/or long COVID in children.
11241,2.
11242,Cases in children are rising.
11243,Transmission happening in sports is starting to be noticed because of required testing.
11244,3.
11245,Children are getting sicker.
11246,More children are in hospitals in Michigan now than ever before.
11247,4.
11248,Children getting sick will continue to be vector of illness.
11249,We need to lower the overall stubbornly high level of case and we can’t do that if children keep spreading and circulating virus.
11250,"Maybe by the fall we won’t need masks, depends where we are."
11251,"Making the statement that masks can’t be required in the fall is just a political move along the lines of saying vaccine passports won’t be allowed, even though it hasn’t been discussed."
11252,These are political points made prematurely.
11253,I keep wondering if science has a way to predict which variant beats another variant in a population; which is most fit?
11254,"For instance, would B.117 or this new one take over as dominant?"
11255,"Working for these chains, all they do is incessantly email, expecting us to give a shit."
11256,Probably never be mentioned again
11257,I believe it.
11258,"Healthcare has got to undoubtedly be one of the most complex and important industries out there, and it's going to be an ongoing battle for a long while to make things better."
11259,"All shots are fully paid for, it's just prohibited by federal law to charge the recipient."
11260,"“May”

(Also, the way that these articles are written that makes it sound like the virus is some sort of evil sentient being, consciously trying to mutate for nefarious purposes, bothers me."
11261,"It’s just a way to try to ratchet up the fear, making it sound like some horror-movie monster.)"
11262,Huh?
11263,Zoom school is what they are doing now... pretty sure most zoom schools insist on cameras on.
11264,Also eight year olds are not like independently-studying college students.
11265,"And good luck with getting a first grader who doesn’t know how to read to “learn independently”, what the fuck LOL"
11266,Refresh my memory how someone is dying from me traveling?
11267,Is this bieng sold in INdia?
11268,Under what name?
11269,My brother is getting this tomorrow i think-HELP
11270,"I would love to see actual proof of such a thing, and not just hearsay from reddit fearmongers."
11271,"Honestly, if you have GAD, you need to stay away from this sub due to the rampant fearmongering."
11272,Just get your COVID-19 briefings from the White House.
11273,literally.how disheartened we would be if they failed miserably and the two shots that we were pinning all our hopes on were AZ and JnJ.we’d be feeling in a really dark place right now today if those were our only two options
11274,"I don’t disagree with your main points, but I have multiple risk factors for blood clots and fall within the demographics at risk."
11275,If they knew this was an issue with AZ and it could show up since they are a similar technology I would have appreciated knowing that risk ahead of time.
11276,"I hate what this is doing for public trust of the vaccine and J&amp;J is a great option for a lot of the world, but I’m going to be stressed for the next two weeks and I just wish that they had been more upfront about the possibility."
11277,It’s not just about businesses.
11278,It’s how many communities and art/music scenes will be destroyed.
11279,For some reason the lockdown fanatics just don’t care.
11280,The Bells Palsy episode also corrected itself eventually in the trials in the 5 or so patients it occurred in

11284,WTH is zoom school?
11285,You don't even need to video chat or see anyone by video most days to do your studying.
11286,"It's not about simulating a typical class virtually, it's about teaching kids to learn independently."
11287,[removed]
11288,"I basically don’t use the pills for hormonal reasons, I like my hormones the way they are."
11289,Blood clots just gave me another reason.
11290,"That said, it doesn’t mean I’m not for birth control and protection."
11291,There are other methods after all.
11292,Wtf are you talking about?
11293,"Calling me a moron, calm down big guy."
11294,Sounds like you're off your meds.
11295,Get vaccinated.
11296,"Once enough people are vaccinated, the restrictions will go away for everyone because cases will plummet."
11297,Refusing to get vaccinated until the virus goes away is incredibly illogical thinking.
11298,So the answer is zoom school?
11299,LOL what
11300,"Well, 70+ is not the only age group that get 80+% vaccinated."
11301,The 60+ group also has a high vaccination rate but the number is still increasing.
11302,They can bill ***insurance*** the cost to administer.
11303,"Per the federal law, no one has to pay so much as a penny for the entire process of getting the vaccine from driving to the clinic to driving home."
11304,"Expressing concern is one thing, but suggesting things that are just going to get a roll of the eyes and a middle finger isn’t helpful to get people to listen to them on things that are actually useful at this point (like getting vaccinated with J&amp;J after they review it)."
11305,"School should be primarily about learning math, science, English, languages, history etc."
11306,Not athletics and school dances etc.
11307,That nonsense is why kids are getting smarter in other parts of the world and our kids are getting dumber.
11308,[removed]
11309,“Long-term effects” JFC people are really grasping at straws.
11310,Fact is that hospitalizations and death from covid are VERY rare in children.
11311,"From the CDC: “...hospitalization among children (8.0 per 100,000 population) is low compared with that in adults (164.5)...” source: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6932e3.htm

Sorry are we supposed to be pretending like we don’t have the data on how low hospitalizations and deaths from covid are in children?"
11312,I really wish that had been told to me as a young homebound person who thought J&amp;J was my only option.
11313,"I’m now stuck waiting the next few weeks, and I probably would have chosen doing one shot of Moderna if given the option from the beginning."
11314,Only vaccines for Ebola have been viral vector before and Ebola for the most part is a 3rd world disease.
11315,They may not be tracking it well for rare symptoms.
11316,Novavax and Valneva are the traditional vaccines.
11317,Same
11318,HIPAA protects you from your employer finding out without your permission.
11319,"If your employer requires the vaccine, that's different."
11320,You'd have to show proof of vaccination or leave.
11321,"But if they don't show proof and the employer doesn't actually require it, they'll be fine."
11322,This is incorrect.
11323,"Covid units are at capacity in some prefectures, not hospitals generally."
11324,"Osaka has only 210 beds for covid patients, Tokyo around 500 I think."
11325,Even if they go to 100% that does not mean all medical infrastructure is overwhelmed.
11326,"Now, the lack of beds for covid patients is another issue... Scummy Japanese medical industry basically refusing to treat people because of risk."
11327,It's really sad.
11328,My family friends in India had a house warming party (smh).
11329,One of the people who attended was looking after a covid positive spouse.
11330,"And now everyone caught covid and one of the elderly ladies is in hospital on oxygen

People are actually idiots."
11331,And this is meant to be educated middle class folk too
11332,"You can’t get Covid from the shot, it isn’t that type of vaccine."
11333,Those 3 million are infections of the entire population.
11334,You would need to compare those 12 deaths to children in that age group.
11335,"Children also experience adverse effects, and we still don't know the consequences of long-covid in children."
11336,"What we do know is that the vaccine is safe, and possible adverse effects from the vaccine are nothing compared to the risks from covid."
11337,[removed]
11338,Meanwhile most of the formula 1 grid still isn’t
11339,"You're not being cruel, you're being daft."
11340,Just like the Indian government who are allowing religious events and political rallies.
11341,I thought the AstraZeneca shot was one dose?
11342,"Anytime I see an argument where someone says “I don’t want to pay for other people’s care”, I immediately ask them to explain to me how insurance works."
11343,They aren’t even that bad.
11344,Daily deaths are down circa 80% since January and are showing no signs of a resurgence.
11345,"The case load is high because few people are dying, and we see it as a worthwhile tradeoff to stay open with lots of sick but few deaths, as opposed to staying locked down with maybe half the death toll and half the spread."
11346,"I think it's indirectly seasonal in England normally - summer people go out open the windows, stuff doesn't spread so well."
11347,"Winter inside shut the windows, down the pub, spread stuff."
11348,Same for colds flu etc.
11349,"Deaths are less reported at the weekend, but not completely unreported, then these get reported on Monday and appear in the statistics on Tuesday."
11350,Presumably there are some paperwork issues at weekends and holidays.
11351,The UK messages a average over a week to smooth out these weekend under reporting.
11352,"Currently the UK death rate is running at 234 deaths per week, that is 33.4 per day."
11353,https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/
11354,Am I being cruel for thinking the Indian Gov wants people to die to thin the population?
11355,Study also finds air lines don’t give a crap about people except for their wallets.
11356,&gt;These vaccines (particularly the mRNA ones) are turning out to be insanely effective!
11357,"Yeah, let's not forget that 6-9 months ago, the bar for a vaccine getting approved was set at &gt;50% efficacy and we thought that if we got lucky we might get one with 75%."
11358,Instead we got two with 95% and a bunch with 75%+.
11359,Live free and die
11360,Well your comments suggests that’s why you are getting angry.
11361,Is your anti British racism affecting your comprehension skills?
11362,"Seems like you are also anti American, why are you even bringing America into this?"
11363,You sound like a sad nationalistic European and should probably try some therapy
11364,"I fully support lockdowns but at this point, what other option is there?"
11365,"IF the vaccines failed (Which I don't think they will), are people supposed to just stay in their homes forever?"
11366,How many years in lockdown is too many?
11367,"If another lockdown rule is enforced, I will follow it, but at this point I agree that vaccines are basically the end game."
11368,"Many insurances will cover ""preventative"" treatments at no cost."
11369,"Like vaccines, not only COVID, but things like flu shots."
11370,Check your own insurance.
11371,I didn’t know it was free
11372,They absolutely straight up lied about masking.
11373,They admitted they did it because they were trying to preserve the medical mask supply.
11374,They certainly don’t seem to have known what they were doing.
11375,Back of the envelope math tells you that the surge in medical demand alone will overwhelm the supply chain.
11376,A seconds thought tells you a substantial fraction of the public will call bullshit on the whole “masks do nothing unless professionally fitted” thing.
11377,"So all that lie does is slow down universal masking, and make some people more resistant to it."
11378,That doesn’t seem like they knew what they were doing.
11379,"Neither does deciding that since we haven’t proven covid is airborne yet, we’re going to assume it isn’t."
11380,"Personally, if I was working with a novel virus, I’d assume it had the same characteristics of the others in its family until I got more information."
11381,"And every other coronavirus is airborne, so that seems like a good starting point."
11382,"Plus, way better to figure out it isn’t and lower precautions, rather than admit it is months late."
11383,"My guess is they thought the words “airborne virus” would cause people to panic, so they refused to admit it."
11384,But an early focus on ventilation would have had huge effects.
11385,The early decisions alter the trajectory way more than later ones.
11386,"Overall, they had a real problem with being unwilling to say anything until they had a study proving it."
11387,"For example, repeatedly saying “the vaccine does not prevent transmission” instead of saying “the vaccine almost certainly prevents transmission, but we don’t have results back yet”."
11388,"So no, as best I can tell they don’t seem to have known what they were doing."
11389,"Even now, the CDC seems to be changing its mind constantly on what’s safe for vaccinated people."
11390,I’d be all for a commission and reform.
11391,"I just worry the overall success at dealing with the pandemic will mask the failures, and the public health community won’t have that introspection and come to Jesus style debrief."
11392,"Don't forget that it's a rare enough condition that many doctors wouldn't recognize what's happening, and neither would their patients."
11393,It's important to keep in mind that it's 6 people _that we know of._ It's also important to keep in mind that all 6 patients were young women.
11394,Was there a drug or treatment they were all taking when they got vaccinated?
11395,"That's not publicly known, but if it's the case, and it's related, it's easy enough to recommend that users of that drug or treatment to get a different vaccine."
11396,"If we ignore everything else, and assume that 90% of blood clot cases were NOT properly identified and reported, and that only third of the blood clot deaths were identified (not unreasonable for this to be identified at a higher rate, unexpected deaths usually get investigated), then it's 60 cases, and 3 deaths."
11397,"That's still a 0.000882353% chance of blood clot for someone who takes it, and a 0.000044118% chance of death

Still, it seems like you didn't pick Taiwan randomly."
11398,"Since they've only had 1000 or so recorded cases, _of course_ their recorded deaths would be low."
11399,"Thats the nice thing about not having hospitals that are not overrun, the case fatality rate can stay ""relatively"" low, at about 1%, which is higher than the other percentages I listed."
11400,"Even in a country which has things mostly under control so far, you can expect to get covid-19 at some point if you never get vaccinated."
11401,"British rags have on idea what the word ""fact"" constitutes."
11402,I dont care if they claim its first.
11403,Your farce of being pro-EU.
11404,"Is just that, a farce."
11405,"When every british rag, like the american ones, feels that the UK is somehow criticized by itsbpeers, its jumps on to the defend it the same way as the hardcore nationalisr publication s. Its just the way it is."
11406,It is simpy funny how they make an example of this doctor while a few weeks ago they were rediculing the EU.
11407,J-Lo must have an incredible manager to get her all these big gigs.
11408,She has maybe 4 noteworthy songs and she uses ghost singers all of them.
11409,"This is like when they say more younger people are going to the hospital, and the response is that ""well, a lot of older people are already vaccinated."""
11410,It makes no sense.
11411,Like there is some baseline of hospitalizations that need to be filled one way or another.
11412,"Our vaccine acceptance is already sky-high, and these passports are only planned to come in well after indoor hospitality is open (outdoor hospitality and all indoor shopping having just re-opened), so I personally don't think these are necessary for domestic use."
11413,This is a ridiculous comment.
11414,Their best clearly isnt good enough then.
11415,There are a lot of useless leaders around the world it seems to me.
11416,"The title of this does not suggest that the UK doctor was the first, just the doctor in the UK who found the link."
11417,"If you read the article it’s clear a number of doctors from various nationalities came to a similar if not same conclusion at similar timelines, just that some made a more public song and dance of the fact."
11418,The Guardian is probably the most EU friendly newspaper in the UK so don’t trash it suddenly as anti European because it hurts your fragile world view that UK doctors couldn’t possibly have also found this link.
11419,You notice they don't call it the Oxford vaccine anymore.
11420,"I remember Boris thumping his chest, making sure everybody knew the vaccine was from Oxford."
11421,Now the bravado and swagger have shrivelled away.
11422,The most shocking thing to me is that people like this have gone a year without getting it.
11423,I don't understand how that is possible.
11424,Covid 19 is not low risk for babies less than &lt; 12 months.
11425,We already know this.
11426,No comment on your incompetence.
11427,The technical term means that the adenovirus can only replicate in an engineered cell line where the host cell includes parts of the viral genome.
11428,"The virus particles produced lack those parts, so when they infect other cells, they cannot replicate."
11429,"This way, the vaccination does not cause a propagating adenovirus infection."
11430,"This crisis has proved that we need competent political leadership and that organizations like the CDC and NIH should have no political interference whatsoever

Do you believe that the scientists had no idea what they were doing?"
11431,Or that they straight up lied?
11432,"And if they straight up lied, what would their motivation be for that?"
11433,I do not disagree that we need to look at everything about this crisis and inspect it 9/11 commission style
11434,Antivaxxer scum.

11440,I’ve literally never seen that happen 💁‍♀️
11441,"&gt;The EU currently has a portfolio of 2.3 billion doses from several companies

The 1.8 billion is on top of that."
11442,"Even accounting for boosters against variants, this is an extraordinary number for a population of 450 million."
11443,Hopefully we'll be able to donate some of them to very low income countries and defeat the pandemic globally.
11444,I'm not sure how the rollout was handled in the US but in Europe most of the first people to be fully vaccinated people are very old people so that could explain a lot.
11445,Not at all.
11446,I didnt say they didnt need to wear a mask lol.
11447,I also didnt say they didnt NEED to be vaccinated.
11448,"For the time being, all adults have the option to get the vaccine."
11449,THEY should be getting it.
11450,"If there's MORE complications with the vaccines for children than the virus itself, then kids should skip it until they get it solid but if mom and dad and grandma and grandpa are vaccinated then everything will be ok!"
11451,!
11452,Here's some data from Germany as published in Paul-Ehrlich-Institut safety reports.
11453,"Unfortunately there's no data of CVST cases from the covid infected groups, only from the vaccinated group."
11454,"&gt;According to the Robert Koch Institute, 14,381,068 vaccinations had been performed by April 2, 2021, including 10,722,876 vaccinations with Comirnaty, 713,067 vaccinations with Moderna, and 2,945,125 vaccinations with Vaxzevria."
11455,"&gt;  
&gt;As of 04/02/2021, 42 cases of central venous/sinus vein thrombosis have been reported following vaccination with Vaxzevria."
11456,Thrombocytopenia was also reported in 23 cases.
11457,"In one case in which central sinus vein thrombosis with cerebral hemorrhage was detected postmortem, the platelet count could not be reliably determined."
11458,"&gt;  
&gt;All but seven of the other cases involved women aged 20 to 63 years."
11459,The men were aged 24 to 58 years.
11460,"Eight patients (5 women, 3 men) died."
11461,"In individual of the patients who suffered sinus thrombosis with thrombocytopenia after vaccination, high platelet antibodies (PT4) were detected, which together with the clinical picture suggest a clinical picture similar to autoimmune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (aHIT)-."
11462,"In aHIT, thrombosis can occur even without the administration of heparin."
11463,"&gt;  
&gt;The Paul Ehrlich Institute has numerically more case reports of sinus vein thrombosis after vaccination with Vaxzevria in women (83.3% vs. 16.7%), with young women being particularly frequently affected."
11464,"However, women were also vaccinated more frequently than men, according to the Robert Koch Institute."
11465,"&gt;  
&gt;For women aged 20-59 years, significantly more cases were observed (n=33) than would have been expected based on the background incidence."
11466,"&gt;  
&gt;Seven cases of sinus vein thrombosis were reported after vaccination with Comirnaty."
11467,No cases reported thrombocytopenia.
11468,Three women aged 34 to 81 years and four men aged 81 to 86 years were affected.
11469,"The number of reported cases, taking into considering the doses inoculated compared with the expected Number of sinus thromboses not increased."
11470,"&gt;  
&gt;(Standardised Morbidity Ratio, SMR, 23.57; 95% CI: 16.22-33.10)."
11471,"The same was true for men aged 20-59 years (SMR 27.20; 95% CI: 10,94-56,04)."
11472,"That's good, because this is the first I've heard of CVT side effects in mRNA vaccines, and I know many experts have been watching for it."
11473,"This may be a dumb question, but what is the rate of CVT before the world knew about COVID-19?"
11474,"Did they compare to that, and if not, should they have?"
11475,FR Massive respect for her doing this
11476,Can someone explain if the az/jj vaccines have similar blood clot rates to Pfizer why isn't there absolutely any outcry about Pfizer and their vaccines?
11477,How come countries like Norway or Denmark aren't reporting deaths or clotting from Pfizer?
11478,How come those countries aren't banning or halting Pfizer compared to az?
11479,Surely they can't be that similar or else Pfizer would be paused to right?
11480,And they're correct.
11481,[removed]
11482,And who did the study?
11483,Liberal scientists!
11484,I don't trust it!
11485,-you know who
11486,Thank you for saying this!!!
11487,"I keep seeing this touted everywhere, but it’s a false dichotomy that’s really not useful to the discussion about the vaccine itself."
11488,Hate speech expert isn't a job in the US because there's no such thing as hate speech in US law.
11489,My dad talks like that and I think it legit messed me up as a kid and almost passed on that thinking to me.
11490,"I just thought it was normal, and couldn’t even realize how disgusting it was until I got much older."
11491,One specific example I remember because it was a family member on his side I didn’t really know was poor and had lots of health problems.
11492,My dads whole family lived in the sticks other than him because he moved out and went to college to be an engineer so he thinks he’s hot shit who earned his money and no one can take it from him.
11493,"Well this uncle or whatever of his decides to go to a Alabama football game, and this just set my dad off for some reason."
11494,"He wasn’t even the one who had lent them money, it was my grandparents."
11495,I guess people that have to get help from others are never allowed to have fun again.
11496,Start exporting then.
11497,I felt like I had a mild hangover the next day and it got worse around the late afternoon (about 28 hours later).
11498,I’d take a sick day if I were you just to be safe.

11500,I think a lot of people round 99% up to 100% in their minds and don't realize that 99% means 99%.

11502,Well can you blame us?
11503,"We have to pay to have children, stay alive if we're diabetic, get any professional help, etc."
11504,And they don't exactly advertise that it's free.
11505,It’s about recognising risk groups.
11506,"If you take a large enough sample size, anything will disappear to background noise."
11507,"If you start limiting to things like under-30, taking birth control etc, the rate is different."
11508,"It appears that if you give AZ to non-risk groups, it is similar to the others, but is worse in certain subsets of people."
11509,"Nonono, Astra Zeneca is being shit talked to revenge brexit."
11510,It makes no sense.
11511,I in general agree that we need more concrete plans for how to get out of this I think picking a date is too arbitrary and our goals should be based on case numbers and vaccination percentage with soft general dates to let people know when that might be
11512,"I know some public universities don't feel comfortable mandating the vaccines until it has full FDA approval, as well."
11513,Ah thank you for revealing this dude to be a waste of human life.
11514,An absolute 0 of a person.
11515,"Yeah, the reduced cases of death compared to the reduced number of cases is also important."
11516,The vaccine doesn't necessarily prevents you from getting Covid.
11517,"You will still be infected, but the chances of needing hospitalization or dying of it is way lower than what you would face if not vaccinated."
11518,"That the sole purpose of vaccines, reducing hospitalization and deaths."

11525,Isn’t it hard to calculate the risk?
11526,I agree with everything except your comparison argument.
11527,COVID is not only dangerous because of blood clots.
11528,So the real comparison is  % Risks of blood clots of Vaccine vs % ALL significant health risks of COVID.
11529,What is it with these comments that pop up *everywhere* claiming that significant numbers of people *want* to stay locked down and masked up forever?

11557,"As far as vaccination history goes, I have not heard of any adverse effects showing up after several months."
11558,Why would this be different in the covid vaccine?
11559,The chances of something adverse happening after such a long time is infinitesimal.
11560,"I am not a virologist, but I cannot see any logical interactions that could lead to such effects after a long time."

11571,Wall Street Journal article this morning.
11572,"I wonder how much of 5,000ish did not end up in the hospital."
11573,"it doesn't qualify as ""mass hysteria"" just because lots of people are making decisions you're unhappy with."
11574,I'm also pro-vaccine and a science teacher.
11575,But I'm certain this has been spun into mainstream media by the PR department/CEO for whoever developed the AstraZeneca vaccine as a way to partially recoup their losses/hold onto their market value on the stock exchange.
11576,I think it is also being done to force countries into taking their vaccine.
11577,"For example, I'm Australian, and until the news of clotting hit, AstraZeneca was the preferred vaccine choice by our government due to a deal."
11578,"Now it's changing so that it will only be used in those over 50yo (which I also don't understand - surely there must still be a clotting risk if you are older, not to mention everyone is unique in terms of their genetics and fitness)."
11579,I bet AstraZeneca is trying to position so that the Aussie government needs to take the previously agreed vaccine amounts.
11580,There are millions/billions of dollars at stake.
11581,Maybe I’m just confused about what the actual success metrics are.
11582,"I get that the bulk of the gains happen with the first shot, but surprised to see so much downvoting on the idea that we track how many people get both."
11583,I also believe most people have an inability to comprehend the life of someone who has had different life experiences.
11584,So if person 1 is not high risk then how could person 2 possibly see this as an issue.
11585,[removed]
11586,The masks went away a long time ago in many areas.
11587,So you can’t say they’re not going away anytime soon.
11588,I’m certainly not going to wear mine anymore once it’s no longer required given I’m now vaccinated.
11589,I'm much less likely to get covid if I let everyone else take the clot risk for me.
11590,"Yep, that's what I had seen as well (in a different format)."
11591,"The vaccine is unquestionably worthwhile for anyone over 29; however, for younger patients and pediatric patients the adenovirus vaccines may not be a great tradeoff."
11592,You’re misunderstanding what the MHRA is.
11593,It’s a medicines regulator.
11594,"The equivalent in Europe is the EMA, which throughout has taken the same actions and had the same narrative at the same time as the MHRA."
11595,The equivalent to those European national advisory bodies is the JCVI in the U.K.
11596,I rented 2 movies to watch for the day after I got my second pfizer shot because I assumed I would be just stuck on the couch feeling sick all day.
11597,I had seen so many posts about it that I thought it was a sure thing.
11598,"Second day came and literally felt 100% fine besides a sore arm, still watched the movies though."
11599,So yeah you may have side effects but it's also possible you won't.
11600,Either way it'll be over soon!
11601,Yeah I thought that.
11602,This might explain why AZ and J&amp;J are linked to clots but the MRNA ones aren’t.
11603,"A really bad reaction to a traditional vaccine can be like having a really bad version of that disease, because you essentially have said disease."
11604,If COVID can cause blood clots so can a non-MRNA COVID vaccine.
11605,Politicians have kids and they don't wanna deal with having their kids at home.
11606,Yes but have ever considered that maybe that sort of birth control isn’t great in the first place.
11607,"Kinda funny how any ‘male pill’ gets stopped in trial phases due to ‘too many side effects’, yet the pill many women take has those same effects"
11608,"yeah but if we already have pfizer and moderna, is covid more dangerous in the week or two more it'll take to source one of those than it is to take AZ now?"
11609,"The gap has narrowed, but according to Bloomberg, CA has been given 31 million shots."
11610,"It has 40 million people, so \~0.78 shots/person."
11611,"NY has been given 15 million shots, has 19 million people, so \~0.79 shots/person."
11612,"TX has been given 21 million shots, has 29 million people, so \~0.72 shots/person."
11613,"The gap has narrowed over the last two months, but even today, NY has been given nearly 10% more shots than TX."
11614,"I have no idea how they decided to allocate the shots, but some have speculated that it's based on the age of the population or number of people in certain age groups."
11615,And also better efficiency.
11616,Dallas has nearly everyone wearing masks too.
11617,It's not only Austin
11618,Because the same people are using the “logic”
11619,Too fucking high for a vaccine to have that risk at all.

11626,"Seems like the US is in a long plateau, hopefully that changes in the near future."
11627,"Indeed, as apparently [the authors themselves state](https://twitter.com/kakape/status/1382657237978640385) ""I think our data say actually nothing about the AZ vaccine."""
11628,"What you are saying, in statistical terms, is that “the death rate, conditional on getting COVID after full vaccination, is identical to the death rate, conditional on getting COVID without vaccination”."
11629,"That may be true, but it’s not very worrying."
11630,That’s because you have a much lower chance of getting COVID at all if you are vaccinated.
11631,"So your overall chance of death is much lower once vaccinated, but if you do happen to be one of those people that contracts COVID after vaccination, your probability of death is roughly the same."
11632,I don't use birth control for that exact reason.
11633,That argument is really weak.
11634,"I am 24 years old and I do take covid seriously, so I social distance, wear mask etc."
11635,My risk of getting covid and dying from it aren't bigger than dying from the vaccine I 100% will use.
11636,"If AZ or JJ were the only ones avaibale sure, I would take them."
11637,But if I just have to wait like two months to get another vaccine without those sideffects I rather wait.

11650,How ever this type of conversation is not allowed and will be downvoted as the majority of people do not want to hear opposing positions.
11651,Instead they just attack and label you as an anti vaxer.
11652,"They only follow science when it fits their agenda and the people that have died from the side effects, well they make up excuses why that happened."
11653,Their deaths don’t matter to them.
11654,They even hope that all the “republicans” die of the virus.
11655,These are scary time we are living in and so many people have lost their sense of humanity.
11656,Compassion is now rare.
11657,"Women on BC are at a much higher rate to get blood clots than either the AZ or J&amp;J vaccines are causing, and nobody is doing anything about it."
11658,What is this bullshit?
11659,Why would most vaccinated people quarantine themselves?
11660,"That's a great Twitter thread, should be mandatory reading alongside the posted article."
11661,"Why does this remind me of the whole ""he [Floyd] wouldn't have died if he didn't have fentanyl in his system""."
11662,"Like I feel like, if I just open this guy's comments..."
11663,And let's talk about the birth control rate of causing blood clots.
11664,"1 in 1,000."
11665,But it's fine for women to be on birth control...
11666,Such a double standard.
11667,Can they not just get a strand of hair from each of them then use the DNA pattern in the transporter buffer to revert them to their non-infected selves?
11668,"Just based on what I have heard, I am planning a light day the day after my 2nd shot, I have heard of people getting their butts kicked."
11669,"Went to a restaurant last night and our waiter said his plan is to get really drunk on the day that he gets his 2nd shot, so when he wakes up in the morning, he won't be sure if it is side effects or a hangover."
11670,Your mileage may vary.
11671,100 percent of people in alot of places are garunteed to get the vaccine tho?
11672,So maybe we still get a proper fucking vaccine that's adequately tested.
11673,If you’re waiting for a zero side effects vaccine of any type you’ll be waiting a long time.
11674,they went through their clinical trials to evaluate effectiveness and safety.
11675,they could run clinical trials for 5 years and release the vaccine and still run into unexpected side effects.
11676,They do their best to enroll participants from a broad spectrum of people but there is absolutely no chance they can test all possible scenarios.
11677,I agree.
11678,I’m not sure how we came down to death as the sole factor.
11679,Sure then we should use the whole population vaccinated with the J&amp;J shot at the denominator 6 out of 7 million.
11680,Not 6 out 1.5 million.
11681,&gt; Why cant people understand that there is a subset of people at significantly higher risk?
11682,Western thinking in general is big on one-size-fits-all solutions &amp; discursive reasoning which causes more problems by looking at problems in isolation.
11683,In terms of number of deaths maybe.
11684,Maybe not if you’re the one getting blamed for people dying of blood clots which you then caused as opposed to blood clots caused by a force of nature.

11724,You can get in a car accident on the way to the vaccine or a COVID test and end up with a worse outcome from either the vaccine or COVID.

11730,"Didn’t see anything glaringly antivax, far right, or religious."
11731,"So, I gave them the benefit of the doubt"
11732,They basically just ran the trials until enough people in the trial got COVID.
11733,Then they compared how many of them were placebo to how many were vaccinated.
11734,"Doing it that way, all a lower or higher community exposure rate does is change how long the trial takes to complete."

\- Historically it has been believed that there were two distinct forms of airborne transmission: 1) droplets which typically fall to the ground within 1-2m moments after being exhaled, and 2) aerosols which are comprised of droplet nuclei that can remain suspended for minutes to hours and travel far beyond 2m."
11776,\- This historical interpretation is incorrect and rather than being a dichotomy it's actually a spectrum.
11777,"Droplets come in many sizes and like anything else, surface area and mass determine the relationship between the opposing forces of gravity and air resistance and thus how long the object can remain suspended and how far it can travel."
11778,"Additionally, there is the question of viral dose and viability within droplets."
11779,And sometimes it is.
11780,"Reddit was always claiming mask work and the virus is airborne, it took CDC a year to admit the same..."
11781,"Yeah it affects everyone differently, hopefully you don’t feel too bad but regardless congrats on getting dose 2 soon!"
11782,Very exciting!

11787,Well put.
11788,"In addition, I would add that a person getting COVID despite vaccination might not be independent with the propensity of COVID to kill someone."
11789,"There could be underlying factors that make a person more likely die from COVID in the first place AND for the vaccine to not work well, for example."

11804,Getting first Pfizer vaccine today.
11805,Should I expect any side effects?
11806,This study quotes two previously healthy young men who died from these rare clots from Covid.
11807,It's clear there should be a cost/ benefit analysis but also it does appear to affect young people.
11808,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214751921000037
11809,Is there any study cohort showing that a simple aspirin daily for a week could be protective?
11810,Seems like a rare reaction that could be prophylaxed
11811,Interesting.
11812,"Fauci has been very, very conservative in his projections lately so his private conversations must be signaling pretty loudly that the pause will be over soon."
11813,The coverage of yesterday's meeting made it seem like a weeks/months pause is on the table.
11814,The good news is we are about 150 million shots away from it mattering.
11815,The 7 million only matter for the last 7 million shots.

11820,*
11821,But do people know that?
11822,"That isn't a side effect from the vaccine, but shit luck and/or acting stupid (no mask / distancing /etc) because of a false sense of security."
11823,"A vaccine with 95% efficacy means there's a 5% chance it won't do shit for you, so keep masking up and such even if you're vaccinated."
11824,"Compared to others, no."
11825,&gt; This surprised me but I had an interaction at work a couple days ago re this.
11826,"Asked someone if he'd gotten it yet and I said ""nah, I can't afford that shit."""
11827,"In Maryland, when we register for your shot, the first question is whether or not you have insurance."
11828,"Even though there's text on the page that says it's just for recordkeeping purposes, I wonder how many people just say ""nope, no insurance"" and then sign out."
11829,"As it’s been all along, the cases number isn’t always enough."
11830,We need to know the age distribution of the cases.
11831,It’s my understanding that the average age of cases and those being hospitalized has dropped.
11832,"Which, if we continue to follow the patterns of the data to date, deaths won’t be as high in the new cases if they are younger people."
11833,Also having a federal system doesn’t help rn
11834,It's not one on the other.
11835,You can talk about it while not doing any pause.
11836,"Ah my bad, nevertheless..."
11837,She compares well to other leaders.
11838,AstraZeneca already tested this.
11839,It didn't work.
11840,Good.
11841,The risk with kids was always that they’d spread it to an adult.
11842,"Adults will have been vaccinated for months, so that issue is gone."
11843,The risk to kids alone is far to low to justify a mask mandate in school.
11844,"Yes, but there's a 100% chance of catching the vaccine if they give you a needle."
11845,"Prepare for the worst, hope for the best"
11846,[removed]
11847,I think its a joke on the state motto (live free or die)
11848,It is absolutely false that “every kid in America has lost a year of schooling.” It’s so incorrect it makes it hard to take anything you are saying seriously.
11849,"All the schools around me have had the option of in person learning for six months now (with masks, and the kids don’t complain about them at all)."
11850,Even the few holdouts on the west coast that waited longer than everyone else are mostly open for in person now.
11851,"And even if you think virtual isn’t as good as in person (I agree), it’s not the same thing as having nothing at all."
11852,I think it’s reasonable to say they didn’t learn as much as they would in a normal year.
11853,It’s not reasonable to say they lost a year of schooling.
11854,As far as masks - the CDC recommendation is age 2+ wearing masks.
11855,My school has kids age 5-12 or so in them and I have not heard a single complaint from kids.
11856,It really doesn’t bother them.
11857,I feel like more information is needed about how they obtained these numbers.
11858,"Are they getting the 290 positive cases from the number of people who sought a test, or did they set up a study with a random sampling?"
11859,Exactly the reason why lockdown must continue.
11860,Opening up now is madness.
11861,"Not gonna lie, she didn’t do everything perfectly, but I’ll miss her when she retires this year"

11875,They were using single doses of AstraZeneca for most of the pop

11877,It's my two week-iversary since I got my second shot!
11878,No doorknob is going unlicked!
11879,Let's say we have 1 million people non vaccinated and 1 million people fully vaccinated.
11880,In the non vaccinated group 10'000 people might get covid and 100 might die (1% fatality rate according to your calculation).
11881,In the vaccinated group 100 people might get covid and 1 might die (1% fatality rate according to your calculation).
11882,So if you just see this flawed fatality rate you might think it is not working but once you compare the two you see that your chance of dying is dramatically lowered if you get vaccinated.

11896,Good
11897,That's just not true at all.
11898,If that were the case you'd see far far more numbers than what is being reported.
11899,"In my city for that matter, they've reported only 10 deaths by COVID while local news agencies are quoting atleast 40 being cremated by COVID protocols."
11900,"Now I'm no expert, but I'm pretty sure there would simply be more than 10 deaths by heart attack or accident in a mid-large sized city in a given day."

11906,Don’t piss on America just cuz this is Reddit.
11907,We are outpacing every other country by a YUGE margin
11908,Evidently 7 million Americans are stupid.
11909,"But with 210 million adults, it’s expected to have at least this many stupid people - so nothing to be alarmed about."
11910,Not even in bad financial positions.
11911,"My tiny county (they don’t even have a website) offered free bi monthly 2 hour cleaning service for the elderly, they will also come by and fill pill containers if you need that, among other things."

11919,Correct.
11920,"Article is truly amazing, “Improving indoor ventilation and air quality will help us all to stay safe”."
11921,Who would have known?
11922,Also why would anyone under 30 take AZ If offered a mRNA alternative?
11923,It's not just about safety but efficacy is also slightly better.
11924,"Not saying AZ is bad or not valid, not at all but this data looks a bit sketchy without seeing hard numbers."
11925,Also it might wildly change depending on what's the probability of catching covid-19 in the first place.
11926,This appears to be the UK variant so it's spreading quite quickly.
11927,Things are going downhill rapidly because of that and the fact that the apparent index cases are from the crowded place where people get drunk and take no protective measures.
11928,"To make matters worse, there're some assh-- \*ahem\* irresponsible people who actively sabotaged the containment efforts by witholding their travel history, or taking flights right AFTER the positive test results."
11929,"Hang in there guys, we're arriving at the destination f\*\*ked and will be with you guys soon."
11930,Agreed.
11931,Same with Moderna.
11932,The individual surgeon and his/her preferences are a big factor in that price variation too.
11933,"Surgical supplies are expensive as fuck, some significantly moreso than others that do the same thing."
11934,"For example, with gallbladders specifically (usually done laparoscopically) pretty much every laparoscopic instrument set has lap scissors in it."
11935,"Many surgeons don't like the feel of the one that comes in the set, so they opt for a single-use disposable lap scissors that needs to be opened separately."
11936,That alone can add a few hundred dollars to your bill.
11937,Rinse and repeat for every action in every surgery that has an inexpensive way to get job done vs some fancy toy that costs a fuckton and you can see why the total pricetag varies so much.

11979,You're more likely to get hit by a falling coconut than get a blood clot from AstraZeneca.
11980,&gt; It's looking more like the covid vaccine will become an annual or bi-annual vaccine (like the flu shot).
11981,What data are coming out to suggest that?
11982,Question: we know that Pfizer has 90% efficacy or whatever.
11983,We also know that it takes 2 weeks for full protection to kick in.
11984,Is the vaccine 90% effective against people with full protection after 2 weeks or 90% effective among everyone who took the vaccine regardless of how many weeks it’s been since their second dose
11985,"Right, but do you get in a car on a regular basis?"
11986,Use a gas stove?
11987,Or any of a million higher risk things that most of us simply ignore the stats on?
11988,Why do you care more about this way of dying than cars?
11989,Im curious about the type of blood clots caused by the mrna vaccines.
11990,As every source states that they cause serious clots but not once stated it is the exact same type of clot as AZ.
11991,If theyre causing similar clots to COVID then Id argue theybare still safer than the adenovirus vaccines.
11992,Moderna has also reported through their own analysis their vaccine does not cause these specific clots.
11993,I will agree the adenovirus vaccines had unusually bad press about low efficacy when they came out.
11994,You teuly cant compare results of efficacy in one study against another that had different variables.
11995,&gt;How so?
11996,"Herd immunity will eventually kill off the virus completely

That doesn't really seem to be happening in Brazil for instance, with lots of re-infection cases."
11997,Hard do say for sure though.
11998,"Because death is the worst case scenario, or so we think."
11999,"After 562,000 people have died, you'd think getting a shot might be something to do for yourself and your fellow man."
12000,"It’s because women take birth control, which can cause blood clots on its own."
12001,The vaccine was effecting females menstrual cycles.
12002,"I got kicked out of the Covid vaccinated sub, I’m not anti vax, but that’s what’s happening."
12003,This is my big question too.
12004,People aren't going to be happy if they can't get a booster shot simply because they initially got the 'wrong' vaccine.
12005,"People make this assumption, but is there any evidence that the vaccines aren't effective against every variant?"
12006,And by effective I mean prevent hospitalisation.
12007,Apparently it will be compatible with Pfizer because they are both mRNA
12008,"This is by no means a proper study and is certainly an annecdotal account from working with many endo and cerebrovascular neurosurgeons, but there has been a significant increase in the number of aneurysms and clots since covid came around."
12009,Clippings and coilings are up while overall surgery numbers have gone down.
12010,If you are already at risk with your current issues I think it's fair to assume your risk would increase even more with covid.
12011,"You are kind of in a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation."
12012,[removed]
12013,"Thanks I'll edit my comment, I didn't read as I assumed this all pertained to AZ."
12014,I'm well aware of that.
12015,I make those decisions every day.
12016,There's a great difference in giving vaccines with potential of causing serious harm to an healthy individual compared to treating a sick patient.
12017,"While the risk may be worth it for a society (in this case), it may not be worth it to an individual."
12018,"I haven't seen a lot of people mention factoring in undermining confidence in the vaccines, but this is the thing that really gets me."
12019,"We already have so many people who are skittish about getting them, and with the media breathlessly reporting everything that could possibly go wrong, this is not helping to persuade them in the right direction."
12020,How many more people will die because we can't get a handle on this fast enough?
12021,I fear we're about to plateau in our efforts soon and it won't be enough.
12022,This should be used for sure!
12023,for women who use birth control they should be monitored or just be offered Pzifer or Moderna.
12024,To me that's still ridiculously cheap.
12025,I probably paid more in petrol to drive to the vaccination centre than what the vaccine cost.
12026,I don't see the point of bickering is it $2 or $3 when the cost to the economy for one person to stay out of work because of lockdown is many times that.
12027,"The US stimulus bill was $2T, which is about $6000 per American."
12028,It doesn't really matter if the vaccine costs $2 or $20 or even $200 when compared to that.
12029,One day in ICU costs more than £1000 in the UK.
12030,"If the UK got any priority in getting the AZ vaccine because it paid $1 more per dose, it was definitely worth it."
12031,That’s 1 million families suffering... really hope we get out of this soon
12032,Yeah it’s almost like getting coronavirus is bad.
12033,"I think the point is that it’s going to be like the flu, that never really goes away even though people get immunised or catch it and survive (thousands die still) there’s no herd immunity that then makes it disappear."
12034,I'm very pro-vaccines as well.
12035,"I think this vaccine is statistically a positive force for the overall community, because a few people suffering from side effects is much better for the community than COVID being left alone and affecting many people."
12036,"But for a given individual, the risk isn't negligible, and the gain is not extreme."
12037,The gain is especially not high if remaining confined and waiting a little until you can get a shot of a safer vaccine is an option.
12038,My parents go their first shots of AstraZeneca.
12039,"My mom had a bad day, like many people, but recovered perfectly on the next day."
12040,My dad had his shot while recovering from bad bruises on the thighs.
12041,"The bruises tripled in volume, got extremely painful for about a week before they started to go back to normal."
12042,"He was crippled during this period of time, and my parents were scared as hell."
12043,"I know this is anecdotal evidence, but yeah the first person I know that took the vaccine got really bad side effects, so it's hard not to be biased."
12044,"My advice: take AstraZeneca if you:
- Can't get another vaccine soon,
- Is in perfectly good health with no bruises, recent surgery, or other factor that increases the risk of side effects."
12045,"Otherwise just wait, wear your mask, stay home and be careful, and take a safer vaccine when you get the chance."
12046,"If you don't put anyone at risk in the community by strictly respecting the guidelines until you get vaccinated, you're not compromising the community and you're potentially avoiding complications."
12047,The anti vaxxers will find a different excuse...
12048,its bad for business.
12049,stop the hysteria.
12050,Surely you can just not get the AZ?
12051,"Just keep wearing a mask and social distancing, that’s what I would personally do in your situation since you are working from home, give it a few months and I’m sure they’d be a more suitable vaccine choice available"
12052,"Yes, it has been the case for most capital's hospitals running low on some drugs needed to treat patients, having to use similar but not ideal drugs, mixing drugs up and so on."
12053,The worst though is to not have proper medications to sedate people going through intubation.
12054,"Not many cases happening, but there are reports since yesterday of some hospitals on Rio having to intubate people with diazepam or morphine instead of the proper medications to sedate people and relax muscles, so they are fully aware of what is happening."
12055,"Some even need to have their hands tied, which is basically torture while trying to keep them alive."
12056,"We're in a dark place in Brazil and I hope all the help other countries can give come to us soon, if anyone decides to help, despite the horrible president we have."
12057,"It would be important to save lives, and reduce general transmission and infection of Covid and the breed of new variants that could be dangerous not only here but to the rest of the world too."
12058,"My only thought was that those people who are experiencing a breakthrough infection are possibly people with more risk factors that cause the weakened immune system, so they may need supplemental oxygen and more treatment."
12059,Question: we know that Pfizer has 90% efficacy or whatever.
12060,We also know that it takes 2 weeks for full protection to kick in.
12061,Is the vaccine 90% effective against people with full protection after 2 weeks or 90% effective among everyone who took the vaccine regardless of how many weeks it’s been since their second dose
12062,"Vaccines are weird in that they are given to perfectly healthy people, in theory."
12063,Don’t underestimate unvaccinated folks blind faith in positive future outcomes.
12064,Other medicine is presumably taken to counter an already-existing problem.
12065,"Due to the number of variants and the lower effectiveness of the vaccines against them, it is possible that COVID will become similar to the flu, with a recurring vaccine tailored to the variants at the time."
12066,I feel like COVID probably kicked mRNA vaccine research up potentially by a decade.
12067,"Not only did you get basically blank cheques to do whatever they wanted to make vaccine come faster, but they got crazy data on what happens when large amounts of people are vaccinated, and on possible side effects."
12068,Lol op is part of Reddit’s 1% and has the job of pushing this type of shit
12069,"In the US, it's pretty much ""not take the J&amp;J vaccine and get Pfizer/Moderna within a few weeks""."
12070,"In some areas, you can get a same day appointment."
12071,"Only hang up is that J&amp;J is one shot, so some people may still prefer that one or can only get that one right now (e.g."
12072,homeless populations).
12073,"Want to expand on that, Dwight?"
12074,That’s great and all but we don’t even know how long the immunity from these vaccines is going to last.
12075,"That being said I was among the first group of healthcare workers to get Pfizer, and I would have taken this one at the time knowing the risks, but why choose this one when you can just wait for a vaccine that isn’t causing blood clots."
12076,"“Getting back to normal” is also a pipe dream, at best we will settle into a more stable “new normal”"
12077,"&amp;#x200B;

To win a lottery ticket is one in a million."
12078,Buying 50 tickets does not give you 50% chance of winning.
12079,the Az vaccine increase change of blood clot by 1/8.
12080,But what is the actual chance to have a blood clot?
12081,Refer to the lottery ticket example.
12082,Ack.
12083,"Lets just say that *the vast majority of Americans are interested in only their own welfare*, because I, for one, have been working at my clinic to *help others* and staying home otherwise to *mitigate the risk to others as well as myself*."
12084,Surprised to see the top comments about a pro-vaccine article having some nuance here on reddit.
12085,"1/8th less of a chance than getting clots from COVID isnt super reassuring for me to get my parents the AZ shot, especially when they arent going outside much and can wait for Pfizer or Moderna."
12086,"Well yes, but people are stupid."
12087,Vaccines aren't failing.
12088,"That's going to be the strategy everywhere - if you think eventually the places that have (temporarily) eliminated it won't open up and have cases... well, I'd like to see you get everyone in those countries on board."
12089,"Elimination isn't a global strategy, and there will *always* be cases."
12090,So I have 8 times more likelihood to get a clot from COVID.
12091,"The prerequisite here is to catch COVID, which if proper social distancing and masking is done is very low, and then hit a very unlikely side effect."
12092,"Vs
AstraZeneca the prerequisite is taking the vaccine."

This isn't true."

12098,"I think the poster means ""efficacy"" and is making the mistake of comparing the published efficacy numbers between vaccines even though it's been explained over and over that the numbers can't be compared unless the two vaccines are tested in the same trial."

12102,Surely the point is that there is a link between the immune response to the spike protein (regardless of whether it's the vaccine or covid) that causes these issues.
12103,Therefore I'd guess that all vaccines for covid will cause the same issues regardless of who designed them.
12104,"RNA vaccines may be different as they ellicit a different type of immune response, but I'd not be surprised if it was the same."
12105,Get your vaccines.
12106,India simply has too many impoverished people for COVID restrictions.
12107,Lockdowns require governments support their people and India isn't capable of that in its best years.

12109,I fear you are just another anti-vax nurse
12110,well it's also dumb people think they are immune right away after getting the shot.
12111,"&gt;If we were truly making data driven decisions about risk, we would be seeing the following policies: 

&gt;1) fully vaccinated people can do whatever they want."
12112,"No masks, no distancing, nothing."
12113,There is growing scientific consensus that says vaccinated persons do not contract or spread covid (the likelihood is extremely small).
12114,"And ***I***, who also performs complex risk assessments in the environmental field, correctly understand that stores, concert venues, clubs, bars and restaurants do not have access to that very high resolution data that allows them to adequately determine who is likely to contribute to a localized outbreak due to not vaccinating and who isn't."
12115,"These places would be filled with irresponsible types who lie and say ""yea I totally got it, yup"" when they are really an anti-vax nutcase and barely 1/3 of the country has been vaccinated."
12116,"Lol, are you advocating for ***vaccine passports*** now?"
12117,Seriously give it up with these strawman arguments.
12118,"Yep, that effectiveness at preventing even asymptomatic cases (assuming a high enough vaccine uptake) will mean we will basically be able to kill the viral spread within a population."

The paper doesn't actually study the frequency with the AZ vaccine."
12123,"They just lift those numbers from the EMA, but the rest of the EMA numbers would say that CVTs are much lower with mRNA vaccines, so it seems a bit of a nonsensical comparison."

12140,"These are compounding categories, yet the media spins them as all being separate things."
12141,"Any time I talk to someone who is worried about a rare thing happening, I bring up car accidents."
12142,It's a statistic that not a lot of people think about.
12143,A friend of mine caught covid pretty bad and now she's posting all over her Facebook and Twitter that masks don't work and she wore a mask every where she went and still caught it (and she went everywhere-I almost feel like she was trying to catch it purposely).
12144,Then someone wrote that the masks are more for the carrier of covid to not spread the virus and she went nuts on him 🤦‍♂️
12145,I’m not sure saying no to AZ and then getting Pfizer in a few months is an option in the U.K. Only women under 30 are given any choice in what vaccine to take; I really don’t know what would happen if someone else said they’d only take an mRNA one.

12149,"The key isn't luck, it's domestic production and producing enough to keep the supply above demand."
12150,Most countries don't have domestic production and those that do may also have export obligations and thus can't just take care of themselves exclusively and first.
12151,"Two people with 80+% immunity is better than one person with 95% immunity, so in the interest of reducing the susceptible population as fast as possible many countries have opted to extend the time between doses."
12152,"Not because they want to, but because they have to."
12153,"Not going to lie, when I read comments made by Americans showing a lack of understanding about how vaccine production in their country and anti-export legislation has had a massive hand in their successful vaccine roll out, it can be grating."
12154,so we are at like 197 million vaccines given right?
12155,how many are fully vaccinated?
12156,but with 197 million that is still like 0.002%

12159,"What people don’t seem to get is that if you are low risk and not personally worried about Covid, when given the choice, you are more likely to choose a better vaccine."
12160,Pfizer/Moderna are both higher effectiveness and come with no bad press.
12161,Can anyone actually say if they had a choice between AZ and one of the above they are choosing AZ?
12162,It offers no advantages.
12163,I am pro-vaccine.

12174,The article being from the UK is irrelevant though since it's talking about the vaccine in general and the article is just as relevant to Australia where I am based right now.
12175,The Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are completely different than the AZ and J&amp;J ones (mRNA vs Viral Vector).
12176,As far as I know there isn't any evidence of blood clots with mRNA vaccines.

12187,Because you haven’t looked.
12188,We’ve known about covid causing clotting issues early on.
12189,I think you should compare the risk of covid and its symptoms to the risk of the vaccine and effects.
12190,Anyone with a brain will immediately realize that any vaccine that is approved for public use is safe enough to provide favorable results when comparing the risks associated with covid versus the vaccine.

12213,However when I was making my appointment through one Healthcare system they wanted me to check a box saying ill pay administrative fees (looking at you HartfordHealthcareand UCONN).
12214,So I went through a different system (called VAMS) I don't think they can charge you that fee if you don't previously agree to it.
12215,"Anyway, I didn't end up having to pay anything."

12249,"Why not pause for women between 18-60, but leave it open for everyone else?"
12250,There are plenty of men and older women who are still not vaccinated and their risk is elevated for covid.
12251,"Even for women 18-60, the risk of covid is still very real."

12262,Let's just say that trust in the government doesn't run very high in parts of the US.
12263,Except that's not how efficacy was calculated in the trials.
12264,"You're looking at absolute risk, efficacy was reported as relative risk."
12265,It's more like in the unvaccinated population the odds of contacting COVID in a period of time was 10% and for the vaccinated it was 0.5% meaning the vaccinated group was 95% less likely to be infected than the unvaccinated for any given exposure.
12266,"Maybe a stupid or weird question but: If you have often haemorrhoids, are you more at risk developing brain clots too (by a vaccine) and should not take AstraZeneca?"

12280,Generally the older group has been more vaccinated than the younger.
12281,"This also means that a case among a young person is far less serious than an older person, so while we might have more cases there should be far less hospitalizations and fatalities."
12282,The younger people are also becoming immune through exposure.
12283,Whenever people are outraged by the beach and house parties they should be happy about the fact that they indirectly increase herd immunity.
12284,A 40 year old male is more than twice as likely to die of Covid as a 40 year old female.
12285,"If women were prioritized early, it could be possible that many men aren't aware of their increased risk, especially given the fact of national leaders high fiving unmasked and bragging of their 'immunity'."
12286,"Sure, go for it, but don't ignore the mass vaccination sites."
12287,"Normal occurrence of CVT is about .5 for 100K people, so 4 per million is what you'd expect with or without vaccine."
12288,"Likewise, it occurs more in women then in men."

12299,Along the way ever increasing vaccination rates will help chip away at new infections.
12300,Otherwise I agree!
12301,I’m going to throw this on too.
12302,"People on average become a lot less careful once they’re vaccinated, meaning that vaccinated people may have a higher exposure to covid and more opportunities for infection."
12303,Here’s a study from 2007 about how vaccinations cause people to take fewer preventative measures: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17688401/
12304,I think the correlation between the two could extend beyond just personal immune factors.
12305,"I would thing vaccinated people would be much less likely to get Covid tests if they are asymptomatic, which means the incidence of “infection” are probably way higher than the 5,800 number, and the ratios for those who are symptomatic, hospitalized, or die over those infected is way lower than measured."

12364,There's no indication that people wants to get vaccinated less here.
12365,There were when the az vaccine was being given.
12366,The government and experts made the right call for us.
12367,"I can't speak for any other country, only how things are here."
12368,And another 7 million won’t get it because of Facebook misinformation campaigns.
12369,"If the US did better contact tracing and publicized the results, we could have proven to people long ago that being outdoors - reasonably spaced out and mindful of the types of activities and the size of the groups we are in - is safe."
12370,"Gotcha, well I am from India."
12371,So maybe there is a bias then.
12372,Just personally I know a few doctors aka 3-4 people hospitalized.
12373,Lockdowns work great in theory.
12374,In practice we've all seen the effectiveness isnt great because compliance will diminish the longer a lockdown continues.
12375,No excuse to not wear masks though.
12376,Thats the easiest measure to take to end the nonsense.
12377,AZ shots for sale!
12378,Git your AZ shots!

12380,There is nothing to indelicate otherwise.
12381,No one has reached heard immunity and it’s not clear when we will.
12382,Until then cases will go up.
12383,🤷‍♂️
12384,You can read the article.
12385,"&gt;Wieler said the situation in intensive care units was worsening, with most cases belonging to the 15- to 49-year-old age group."
12386,&gt;It also found that a stunning 90 million U.S. residents feel some form of vaccine hesitancy.
12387,We Americans are not the brightest.
12388,"I truly can't understand how anyone could have pride in this ignorant, lazy, violent country."
12389,It's depressing.
12390,It’s free?
12391,Then why do they demand insurance information?
12392,It may be no cost.
12393,But it’s not free!
12394,There is a difference.
12395,Or so says the state attorney when I was informed for advertising something free for people because the insurance paid for it.
12396,"The SaNOtize treatment is designed to kill the virus in the upper airways, preventing it from incubating and spreading to the lungs."
12397,"It is based on nitric oxide (NO), a natural nanomolecule produced by the human body with proven anti-microbial properties shown to have a direct effect on SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19."

12405,"Per the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/vaers/index.html), the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is used to collect reports of adverse events after vaccination from the general public."
12406,This is primarily used to identify potential topics to further investigate with regards to vaccine reactions.
12407,"However, because the event data in VAERS is often not verified and is often self-reported, it should not be assumed that the adverse events in VAERS are actually associated with or cause by the vaccines, nor is it possible to estimate the frequency of these adverse events from these data."

12410,*
12411,If this is the background rate then why have no CVST events been reported to VAERS after Pfizer and only 3 for Moderna (none with low platelets) after ~200 million doses?
12412,"I mean they did say it’s 95% effective, not 100"
12413,Seems like the comments are more [against the close groups](https://www.reddit.com/r/raleigh/comments/fvo5ye/people_in_north_cary_park_playing_volleyball_and/fmkwh47?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).
12414,Even this WaPo article says that distancing is important outdoors.
12415,You can't have 6 feet between yourselves when you have 5 people on each side of a volleyball net and they're all slapping hands and breathing heavy.
12416,"He's been tested for infections, and nothing has came back."
12417,He was transferred to a different hospital for more testing.
12418,That’s what it seems like...
12419,"What you're saying is true, but my point is that we don't know to what extent the risks are higher for certain groups of people because unlike the other examples you gave, we have a miniscule sample size."
12420,"If men and women are equally likely to have this complication, there is a 1/64 chance that we'd see the pattern we do."
12421,"I'm not saying we ignore differences in sex, age, and race - I'm saying we don't know what they are yet."
12422,I expect that airborne covid particles are like exhaled cigarette smoke.
12423,"If you are close enough to a covid positive person, or in an environment with poor ventilation that if they were a smoker you could smell their smoke you are probably breathing in their exhaled viruses."
12424,"It's unfortunate that we can't smell covid, although dogs apparently can."
12425,My husband had a stroke from what doctors believe was covid.
12426,He felt I'll in April of last year.
12427,But his stroke was on July 1st.
12428,He has a Protein S deficiency.
12429,Which alone is extremely rare.
12430,He was a healthy male before this.
12431,Conspirty theory time.
12432,Given all the investment in vaccines.
12433,If there was a easy cure for covid symptoms then it would make vaccines almost redundant.
12434,"It is hilarious that you are being downvoted so much, as I’m sure I will as well."
12435,"I called the huge explosion for MI a couple months ago when the infection rate showed a clear upward trajectory, breaking from the trend of every other state in the nation."
12436,"I was derided then, and saying that the majority of states today are showing the same trajectory today will draw equal hate I bet."
12437,"Unless vaccines put a damper on it, I expect many states to be in a similar situation as MI in the coming weeks / months."
12438,"I hope I’m wrong, but this is my read of the data trends I’ve been seeing."
12439,"I haven't downvoted you, but it does sound implausible that you personally know ""quite a few people"" who were hospitalized after both doses."
12440,"RI recently studied this and only a bit over 1/1000 people in the population were diagnosed with covid after vaccination and only 20/200,000 were hospitalized for any reason (not necessarily covid)."

12449,Just read the Johnson meeting notes.
12450,"They said out of the 6 out of the 1.5 million doses given to 18-45 year old females, that these blood clots in the brain are way above expected cases."
12451,"Also, 3 million more people are still in the stage where it can develop so they are waiting for people to come forward."
12452,I’m not feeling too good about the “higher than expected” result.

12460,I hope CDC is competent enough to leave that option open when shit really hits the fan where neither the field hospitals and real hospitals are enough to handle all the COVID patients.
12461,"For now (reads immediate future), keeping the infected away from the neighborhoods are the better solution than telling infected people to stay home."
12462,You can't really trust people to 100% follow the isolation procedures and not putting the rest of the population at risk.
12463,"It is my understanding that the JnJ is also mRNA, it just uses DNA as the delivery method as opposed to single strand RNA."
12464,Which is why JnJ is a single shot and the others require two doses.

12471,&gt; Why they meddle with the patent rights I dunno though.

12475,can't vaccinate more than you get
12476,I got my second Moderna shot yesterday.
12477,I’ve never been so happy to feel like such shit.
12478,"Looking forward to a booster in the fall, side effects be damned."
12479,Which doesn't mean that countries not using them can't be correct too.
12480,"For Poland (15 daily deaths per million people in the last 7 days) the decision is not the same as for Norway (around 0.6 daily deaths per million people in the last 7 days, i.e., 25 times less)."
12481,"Other countries, like the US, are at some point in between."
12482,"The US however is swimming in mRNA vaccines, which Poland isn't, so no wonder the US is not in a big rush to use viral vector vaccines either."
12483,"That's a pretty simple thing to find out, but it would take a lot of work."
12484,"You'd pretty much have to go day by day, look at the number of vaccinated people infected vs non vaccinated, then adjust for the relative % of the population."
12485,I.E.
12486,"if say 100 nonvax are infected and 2 Vaxxed are, but vaxxed make up %25 you'd have to multiply by 4."
12487,"Then you can say infection is at a 2:25 rate, which would be 92% effective."
12488,"You'd do this for every day and then average it all together, but I don't know what the best way to find that would be, but I'm sure math people know."
12489,"Well we can never know for sure, but at least one poll so far shows a 15 point drop in the public perception of the safety of the J&amp;J vaccine after the pause."

12496,Oh sorry for the confusion - I think we're on the same page!
12497,I shared this article because I think it makes another solid point for getting vaccinated.
12498,"People are worried about getting this rare clot from vaccine, when they are significantly more likely to get it from COVID."
12499,"With birth control, I'm not 100% sure, but I believe birth control has much higher instance of blood clotting than COVID vaccine, but it's a different type of clotting than the CVT"

12509,"I am going to just like, not go, until mask mandates are lifted because a concert or club full or masked people just sounds fucking weird and grim to me

You can go if you love the idea of that so much

My point was that I do not think I’m at all alone in thinking that certain settings just don’t lend themselves very well to mask mandating"

12523,"Totally, and people need to remember it is not reflective of most people."
12524,Most people are not very engaged with things.
12525,"I thought you were saying that like birth control, covid doesn't cause the rare brain blood clots, which would be false."
12526,Covid causes the rare brain blood clots more than the vaccine does.
12527,Hopefully it doesn't keep people from vaccinating.
12528,Since AZ is currently paused for young people it makes sense to save the available Biontech vaccines for them
12529,How come the sets look ten times better when it took place ten years BEFORE Kirk's Star Trek?!
12530,That's the problem with prequels.

12532,I am a 35 year old female that has PCOS and irregular periods steady so during their cuts I have been asking them some stuff.
12533,They all say it’s safe to take the shot and this is very rare to get a clot from either birth control or a vaccine but it IS happening and they are looking into it.

12535,Yes.
12536,Very much so.
12537,"Although it will still rely on quick testing, diagnosis and availability."

12540,I have a right to be there to work.
12541,"Foreign travel is allowed for Japanese citizens who can come and go as they please to most countries in the world, even as tourists."
12542,"If Japan really cared about the spread of covid they would not allow this, and would take actions domestically."
12543,They are not taking it seriously at home and not vaccinating as well.
12544,So I got my first dose of Moderna last week.
12545,"If I wait until next week (around the two week threshold for it to kick in), about how ""safe"" would it be for me to visit another individual who is currently fully vaccinated?"
12546,"I'm definitely aware that I'm not fully protected without the second dose, but I may not have the privilege of waiting for it before this specific meeting has to happen."
12547,This argument gets made a lot unfortunately and it is quite shortsighted.
12548,2-4 weeks of US supply make quite a difference for a lot of countries struggling with supply and surging cases currently.
12549,The sooner they can start exporting the better.
12550,Yeah I've come across slower stores who just incorrectly bill people because they didn't have the help required to get through this and care.
12551,I'm lucky to be at a store that already had more tech help and I'm still burning out pretty hard recently.
12552,Honestly my main reason for giving a shit about proper billing is just that I know how much money many pharmacies in my chain are losing even before vaccines.
12553,"I'm pretty nervous the hammer is gonna fall hard when all this is over and we'll have more tech cuts, hour cuts, etc."
12554,The MHRA (UK regulator) said that from the UK at the moment there isn't a clear gender discrepancy.
12555,"More women than men in the UK had the side effect but more women than men had the AZ vaccine and when they corrected for that, there's currently no effect."

12557,It’s supplementary.

12561,Thanks for the correction!
12562,Do you have any idea what happens to AZ refusers?
12563,"I’d obviously rather get AZ than nothing, but I’m totally content to be at the end of the queue if that will mean an mRNA one is available."
12564,I’m a WFH introvert anyway...
12565,Don't expect useful data from Poland.
12566,We lost around 2M doses of vaccines in some kind of logistical hell.
12567,"It *is* weird, of course, I don't deny that."
12568,"What Im saying is that it says a lot about you that such a simple ""weird"" thing turns down your plans."

12577,"&gt;And a much more important note:  
&gt;  
&gt;Risk of blood clot from COVID is **eight times higher** than from a COVID vaccine"
12578,Criticizing yellow journalism is as fair and reasonable as journalism criticizing things.
12579,Several vaccine sites have charged money.
12580,Two Americans I know paid $340 and $190 for Pfizer.
12581,The person who paid $340 did not have insurance.
12582,There is no legal barrier to any vaccine site arbitrarily choosing to charge money for it.
12583,"Remember, in the USA, healthcare isn't a right, it's a privilege for the wealthy few."
12584,"I'm sure it's free in states which have made that a requirement, but don't distort the facts here and claim it's the Americans who simply don't know."

12593,That seems more in the realm of behavioral science and psychology.
12594,"This might sound weird, but a not-insignificant part of me enjoyed my J&amp;J after-shot side effects."
12595,"I haven't had a guilt-free stay on the couch for a long, long time."
12596,"My girlfriend and I got our shots at the same time, so we ate leftovers and watched a baking competition on Netflix all day."
12597,"Yes, I was so fatigued that it took all of my body's energy supply to get to the bathroom and back, but because I knew the symptoms would fade within just a couple days, it was comical, the grunts and the moans."
12598,"I was feverish so I cuddled under blankets the whole time, cozy and snug."
12599,I was achy so I was very gentle and kind with myself.
12600,"Being sick is not as good as being healthy, but especially when it's a vaccine side-effect with no reason to be alarmed or upset, it makes for a day of deep rest and relaxation."
12601,"By the next morning, I felt almost normal."
12602,"If after all of that you still feel anxious, then I would suggest that somebody in your past *made* you feel bad for being sick, and if you reflect on that and can figure out who it was, you might be able to give them the middle finger from under a pile of blankets next week."
12603,"If the US made a serious attempt to do tracking, they could."
12604,"Automated methods, based on cell phone proximity, could accomplish the purpose very effectively."
12605,"Privacy concerns, of course, but the technology is definitely possible."
12606,Do post a link for those who are unaware....please?
12607,"Sure, but for example in Denmark it is."
12608,Probably in the US too (with J&amp;J).
12609,That's why they stopped with AZ all together.
12610,Where are you getting this from?
12611,"The MHRA (British regulator) said when they corrected for the ratio of male to females who had received the AZ, they weren't seeing a gender discrepancy at the moment at all."
12612,"Yeah, no."
12613,"I am going to trust the cdc on this, not the preprint by people who didn't mention the British cases for months."
12614,"More details from a local article:

How is summer 2021 looking?"
12615,"Asked about what he sees the summer season looking like for Market Square Day and other large scale events, Sununu said, “I really mean it, plan big, plan big.”

He asked businesses and citizens to think how things will be two months from now."
12616,"“Everyone who wants a vaccine is going to be absolutely fully vaccinated … everyone who wants a vaccine can get in the system now,” Sununu said."
12617,"“Our case numbers are going to be up, I think, through April and even early May, but the fatality rate is down.”

He predicted COVID case numbers will “come down drastically in May” and by June there will be “very low case numbers, very low fatalities, a fully vaccinated population … with a lot of cash in people’s pockets.”

“They all want a vacation, they want that vacation they didn’t get in 2020 and the word is out New Hampshire’s the place to be,” he said."
12618,"He also encouraged communities to “plan big if you’re planning parades or festivals, don’t think about like it’s April 14, think about it like it’s July 4th.”"
12619,"Same, gotta get that summer body ready."

12627,"Feels good to live in CT (our officials here have been doing a great job throughout tbh, feels weird complimenting them but here we are)"

12630,Pfft!
12631,Is that the same as Trump's injectable sunlight?!
12632,'.
12633,I think that it is obvious (for both AZ and J&amp;J vaccines) that the benefits outweigh the risks.
12634,"But it still leaves the question, *which ones of all the COVID-19 vaccines* have the best side effect profile."
12635,I understand that currently it would be impractical to right away pull out all the vaccines that show some downsides.
12636,"Because the side effects have been minor enough, and we want to keep the ball rolling."
12637,"But in the long run, I think it is good to pay attention which vaccines are the very best."
12638,Gradually move to better and better vaccine selection.
12639,[deleted]
12640,It says right in the article thay coronaviris causes these same rare blood clots 8 times that of vaccination.
12641,Did you read your article?
12642,The 5m from India never arrived i believe
12643,USA should do the same with our extra doses

12645,Ahh.
12646,"So they went from ""not even wrong"" to just plain wrong."
12647,“Bullshit claims” are you saying the data isn’t there?
12648,It’s made up?
12649,Fabricated?
12650,"https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=covid+risk+children

Y’all are really, really that butthurt that the risk to kids is very low?"
12651,I disagree.
12652,I think it would be seen as a coverup of some sort.
12653,The fun of skiing outweighs the risk.
12654,I don’t think the benefits of going maskless outweigh the risks yet.
12655,If numbers continue going down or vaccines become available to kids?
12656,Sure.
12657,"But currently the risk outweighs the benefits, particularly for those children who do have a health condition that puts them at a higher risk."
12658,I’m even willing to say we might be at a point where the benefit of being without a mask outweighs the risk in the fall.
12659,"But we don’t know right now, so I think it’s foolish for Florida to go ahead and say you can’t have a requirement."
12660,There are currently no variants that require boosters.
12661,I'm not sure what your argument is here.
12662,"Letting it rip certainly isn't covid zero, so I guess I'm glad you've dropped that useless goal."
12663,"Well, I do, but pride cometh before the fall."
12664,"I do it out of compassion, because I feel others pain and sadness as though it were my own."
12665,"God made me for a purpose...to *help* the needy, suffering, and the ignorant, alike....even you."
12666,My people!
12667,"Female in late 20s, and I got my vaccine about 12 hours before the news came out about clots and the pause."
12668,"I've been extremely anxious the past two days and unproductive at work, thinking every little pain or pinch I feel in my body is a blood clot."
12669,"I thought I would be less anxious after getting the vaccine, but now have to endure this for a few more weeks (or more)."
12670,I don't think I will ever get the anti-mask stuff.
12671,In an absolute worst case scenario you are mildly inconvenienced and the mask is useless.
12672,That's the worst case.
12673,I get the opposition to lockdowns and restrictions as those have an economic impact on people and their jobs but masks?
12674,I don't get it.
12675,"Looking at my local ICU data, no doubt people in the broad age category of 40-59 are gaining representation as % in the ICU, but people 60+ are dwindling, so it makes sense people that are now the next level of risk and are exposed to the public with their jobs are starting to take greater representation."
12676,"Added to this, the 20-39 age category has been flat as % of representation from pre-variant to now."
12677,"It is true that more are getting sick, but it is not affecting younger people more than older people and, in fact, the composition has remained similar to pre-variant cases."
12678,"It is still sensible to vaccinate older populations before younger populations, especially now that in my area we are vaccinating the population most represented in our ICUs."
12679,"If you throw in immune compromised people and healthcare workers who are more like to high level exposure, that increased risk of death cohort is even larger."
12680,I don't have access to the raw data but this could even mean that the vaccine drops the death rate of those infected down by a cohort.
12681,As in 85+ dies at the rate of 75+ and so on.
12682,"""The issue is this is a factual report,"" said Sarah Roberts, an information studies professor at UCLA."
12683,"""But the people reading the report either have such deeply-held preconceived notions about its meaning or they lack appropriate context to receive the information."""
12684,If it's a factual report what is the issue really?
12685,Is it productive to shut down someone who is giving factual information because that person has incorrect beliefs and someone else might misinterpret what they are saying?
12686,"Isn't that just going to further entrench the conspiracy theorists view that ""they"" don't want the truth to come out?"
12687,Serious question Does the phrase you are the product when the product is free apply here?
12688,Or is that just internet data related
12689,"LOL I guess most Reddit people really haven’t been in a concert or club before

Yes, precisely, it is “weird”."
12690,I am going to bet that I am not in the minority when I say that
12691,"That family who got their 90 year old grandfather infected, bribed for bed space, and then want their money back since he didn’t live long in the hospital..."
12692,"Birth control and others have higher instance of clotting, but not this super rare type"
12693,"pretty much no german politicians are vaccinated, they are in priority group 3

the older ones have a faster chance getting it through their age, like this"
12694,Do you have a source showing that most of the MRNA vaccine recipients who got CVT were young to middle aged women?
12695,Day 6 for me.
12696,We're almost there!
12697,You pay nothing no matter what.
12698,"The insurance is supposed to pay if you have it, the government pays if you are uninsured."
12699,"I am not arguing anything with you, son."
12700,Calling you out for what you are.
12701,A month old sub designed to troll COVID subs.
12702,Your history speaks for yourself.
12703,Your spamming the same message over and over again reinforces it.
12704,Your insistence I have no argument to refute your claims because I won't indulge your bullshit claims seals the deal.
12705,This is a troll account.
12706,1 month old.
12707,Avoid engaging it.
12708,"Yeah, I’d pay anything to not get covid."
12709,Once i’m fully vaccinated I’ll begin to ease off some of these measures.
12710,"That's why she takes AZ, because now we know AZ is 101% safe."
12711,Which is fair for the COVID vaccine.
12712,"If they aren't going back to normal after being fully vaccinated, there is literally no point."
12713,It wouldn't be unheard of for mixed vaccines to produce a combined stronger response.
12714,But by the time the trials finish many nations will already be committed to the double jab course.
12715,i'm sure you would just like there are many who are willing to take risks with challenge trials... but we don't actually have that much information about these side effects besides what's been reported... how do we know if it's not a manufacturing defect or medications or a reaction to a new variant?
12716,how do we know it's not going to get worse?
12717,this is how our health organizations behave.. they react to new information and assess it.... it's no different than recalling foods with listeria.... i'm sure many people would take risks with contanimated food especially if they're not pregnant but why take that risk when there are readily available alternatives?
12718,The Venn diagram of people who’s confidence is going to be increased by this pause and people who were already 100% getting the vaccine regardless of anything that came out is a complete circle.
12719,Years?
12720,"I'm on the same boat of being done with this, but hun this last for one year, lol."
12721,"if your comment got an upvote for every life this vaccine will save, and a downvote for every life it will take, you would have the most reddit karma of anyone ever."
12722,i'm gonna start by giving you an upvote.
12723,have a nice day.
12724,I'm so excited!
12725,I leave in 20 minutes for my appointment at Walmart to get my first shot.
12726,Really grateful for [the vaccinespotter website](https://www.vaccinespotter.org/)!
12727,I mean....  do they not pay attention... it’s literally everywhere.
12728,Billboards.
12729,Tv.
12730,Commercials.
12731,Hospital walls.
12732,Company emails.
12733,Etc...   if you don’t know you aren’t paying attention or are intentionally living under a rock...
12734,She's achieve many impressive things in her career but a leader taking the vaccine with the most hesitancy behind it to build confidence is just common sense.
12735,Not like she's taking a bullet.
12736,Perhaps she is...
12737,"I don’t actually think that, but I wouldn’t be 100% surprised either"
12738,"Something doesn't add up here, yesterday we had news from Denmark stating risk of blood clots for AZ is 1 in 40000 for certain age group."
12739,Granted I don't know if that number is accurate either but considering Denmark suspended it for good they must have a good reason to do so.
12740,The polls in 2016 were extremely accurate.
12741,The problem was actually just that you don't understand them.
12742,"I got my vaccines in Washington state and there was never any mention of insurance, period."
12743,Think Ireland is the only country doing mandatory hotel quarantine in Europe so far and it’s been an absolute shambles.
12744,"People threatening to bring it to court and being let out, sports teams given exemptions even though it was stated “no exemptions would be made” and now the hotels are overbooked so people are coming in without having to even go to their hotel because there is no rooms."
12745,Prof forgets that his vaccine have had huge delivery delays to countries like Denmark and that the choice is not between AS and no vaccine at the moment.
12746,AZ have delivered a very limited number of doses to Denmark and deliveries are far behind the schedule.
12747,The delay in the vaccination program caused by not using AZ is perhaps even in the single digit days for groups with extremely low mortality.
12748,"I agree it’s a good vaccine, but for countries like Denmark and Norway it’s not unreasonable to evaluate the vaccine and decide to use other vaccines."
12749,You can still study COVID-19 LOL you need to educate yourself my guy
12750,Over 60 year-olds get mainly Astrazeneca in Germany now
12751,"It's free no matter what, but certain sites (for sure most pharmacies) are supposed to take insurance info still for billing."
12752,"At my chain, if someone is uninsured, we have to ask for their state ID number or social security number and get audited and not paid if they had insurance after all."
12753,Coworker and wife got their second vaccines (Moderna) 5 weeks ago.
12754,Both positive for covid today.
12755,It’s especially frustrating for those of us who have followed the guidelines from the beginning.
12756,"When you do your part and others don’t do theirs, it’s easy find yourself mentally fed up with the situation."
12757,"Even if the side effect is two orders of magnitude worse than it currently appears, it’s *still* a net benefit to continue inoculating people."
12758,"Furthermore, all the clots so far have occurred in women under 50."
12759,"Recommend pausing the vaccine in women under 50, and keep going for everyone else."
12760,*We can have our cake and eat it too.
12761,*
12762,"In florida, it's not free was told yesterday unless I have insurance its 128$ so guess I'm not getting it"
12763,"Some fields of work may require it in the future (medical, military, etc)."
12764,But since it's still EUA AND some areas have shortages they're probably playing it safe and holding off requiring it for now.
12765,It’s like we are conditioned to expect to pay for healthcare
12766,"""Some doses unused"" doesn't mean vaccine hesitancy is too high, it means that you're at the point where all the people who wanted to rush out to get it right away have gotten it."
12767,"Now your area is at the point where people who weren't so gung ho or needed to wait for it to be convenient for one reason or the other are getting it, and it's going to be a steady stream of vaccines for a while."
12768,"Of course we wish that people would get them asap, but ultimately you're going to see a lot more people vaccinated."
12769,"[In March](https://khn.org/news/article/covid-vaccine-hesitancy-drops-among-americans-new-kff-survey-shows/) we were already at 62% who had gotten it or would get it as soon as possible, and another 17% saying they'd ""wait and see""."
12770,"The wait and see group has been steadily shrinking, and I would bet the April results will have us closer to 70% who have it or want to get it asap."
12771,We'll get there.
12772,Your post was removed because we cannot verify that it is a reliable source.

12782,Yes we do.
12783,You're stupid for a million reasons outside of a vaccine.
12784,[removed]
12785,Had my gallbladder out a couple years ago.
12786,It was scheduled a month or so in advance and they ran it through my insurance to give me the cost I’d have to pay.
12787,"Gave me the total, said they’d knock off 10% if I paid in full beforehand."
12788,"I was able to pay upfront, and that met my deductible for the year lol."
12789,Twice in the following year I got a bill for the amount from the hospital.
12790,Just had to keep telling them I’d already paid and showed them the receipt.
12791,"All non-vaccinated will be now known as ""Squids"""
12792,It means capacity is no longer one of the restrictions.
12793,Have you ever seen a resturant literally at their capacity?
12794,There is a reason it is set for safety sake.
12795,A resturant does not have nearly enough seating for the number of people they are allowed at capacity at any time regardless of social distancing
12796,"I can see it for Gary, and the Region...because that's pretty much Chicago anyway."
12797,But I really doubt people in Marion and the donut counties around Indy are competing with out of state people.
12798,They'd have to pass over dozens and dozens of other rural sites before they landed on Indy.
12799,"There really is still some demand, but there are areas that are probably quicker."
12800,"The day 30+ and then 2 days later when 16+ opened, it was 2 or 3 weeks out to get an appointment in the Indy metro area (at least when my friends and I looked that day)."
12801,Today was my appointment finally.
12802,The only friends I had in this phase that were able to get it sooner drove about 50 miles away.
12803,"Yup, I know 3 people here in New York had to pay a $25 copay at the pharmacy."
12804,"""Out it's self"" lol, or trying to cover their asses in the upcoming lawsuits"
12805,The people not vaccinated are young and healthy.
12806,No reason to keep stuff shut down.
12807,Open it all.
12808,If you're at risk stay home until your vaccine appointment.
12809,If it’s free maybe they shouldn’t ask if we have insurance or ask people to bring their insurance card.
12810,Figures.
12811,"To all the people who want to go back to ""normal""...start looking for a time machine."
12812,What makes you so confident that vaccine passports will be abolished when the pandemic is over?
12813,What makes you confident that there will even be an official pronouncement that the pandemic is over at all?
12814,What's the chance that the person administered my vaccine in the wrong location?
12815,"I checked after I got home and the band-aid she put didn't even cover the shot, lol."
12816,Probably selling members healing crystals and essential oils to protect them from the rona.
12817,I remember a time when money was all you needed.
12818,People need to stop pushing their fucking beliefs on others.
12819,Live and let live
12820,"I just got confirmed astrazeneca for this Saturday, but I'm now reading these news."
12821,"I am 21y/o female, good immunity, my only weak spots are that i have HPV and some allergies to environmental factors."
12822,Should I cancel the appointment or should I go with it?
12823,I can't ask my parents for advice because they are antivaxers... so any feedback would mean the world to me.
12824,It will be floating around forever (or way past any future we or our descendants will see)
12825,"Life goes on: Movies wouldn't have been delayed, I would've seen BTS in concert, EDC Orlando and other festivals wouldn't be pushed to 2021, honestly like any other year but ya know...no damn pandemic."
12826,"The last thing I did in March before lockdown and the virus began to hit hard was party my ass off with some tourists from Japan up in NYC, I miss that RN and hope after my second vaccine is a slow return to it."
12827,Have they reached any milestones?
12828,Or is the virus the participation trophy?
12829,Good thing that you have made tha vaccine available for foreigners.
12830,You are really giving some hope to those who can travel to the US.
12831,[removed]
12832,"True, but isn’t that how trial 3 for these vaccines a calculated their efficacy?"
12833,They had no clue how many in the study were actually exposed to the virus
12834,"Yet, there have been far more cases per capita so far in the Czech Republic, despite a slew of increasingly absurd ""measures""."
12835,"After reading the study, it seems to me that their statistical evaluation is a bit sloppy."
12836,"First, they compare blood clot data in people vaccinated with Moderna in the US to the same data in people vaccinated with AZ in Europe - for the latter they did not conduct their own analysis but simply cited data from the EMA."
12837,That's not necessarily correct from a statistical standpoint.
12838,"Also, nowhere in they study they provide a breakdown by age, except for the unvaccinated cohort."
12839,"All in all, the study is about the risk of CVT in people with COVID vs. vaccinated people, it has very little to do with the comparison between different vaccines."
12840,Didn’t the orange satan initiate some healthcare pricing transparency actions?
12841,It was a part of the healthcare reform he was pushing
12842,How long?
12843,I am surprised too.
12844,"Particularly in my country, where our health minister was upset with EU's comments on AstraZeneca and a few proeminent medical experts made some unpleasant comments about how hundreds of people die every year from secondary effects of various medications, so a few hundreds deaths from the vaccine are no big deal."
12845,"I was, and still am, extremely angry with these comments."
12846,Which is good considering how some of their roster is anti-vax (Nia Jax for starters).
12847,"Nations who invested in the vaccine have get it cheaper, also different contractors making the vaccine have differing costs."
12848,Naturally more volume is cheaper to produce than smaller volumes.
12849,"2% is the known CFR, not the presumed IFR"
12850,"You're insane if you look at any state in the United States and declare their covid response as ""it worked""."
12851,And I have no idea what your non-United States comment means.
12852,2% is the known IFR not the presumed CFR
12853,That's over a period of 10 years tho and with something you take almost every day.
12854,"And again the point is that it's the government promoting a vaccination that for a group would be similar levels of dangerous or even more dangerous that what it is supposed to protect from, which seems  quite unethical."
12855,Try billions... we’ll be seeing the remains on our beaches for the next 100 years
12856,"I dream of the day when our country is filled with educated, rational, and logical people like you."
12857,"Oh, and my kids 9 / 6 are super pumped about vaccines and I wish I could get them vaccinated."
12858,Glad I have spent literally zero money on useless disinfecting products
12859,My country is using every other option available.
12860,Even an indian one that I dont even know the name and has been approved in like 2 other countries.
12861,I think having those two options only would be a blessing for some.
12862,Michigan is 10th out of 50 states in population.
12863,I would definitely not call that small
12864,"&gt; If it can save one person by banning it, wouldn’t you ban it?"
12865,"Definitely not, this extreme risk aversion is completely opposite to what we do in every other area of life (including covid restrictions) and goes against all rational risk/reward logic."
12866,I would hope by next year we don't need them but god help us if anyone's on track to extend this thing to 2022 it's Florida.
12867,"I believe most cases occur 5-16 days after the shot, the longest suspected case (not confirmed) was 19 days, that's for AZ but JnJ will likely be similar, I would stop worrying entirely after 3 wks."
12868,That's a good point.
12869,"Looking at pics of people ""socially distanced"" over the past year and it's amazing how much 6 feet looks like 3...."
12870,The only the thing my county asked me was the name that the appointment was registered under.
12871,They didn't even ID.
12872,They don't need to.
12873,"Even if she's worried about being billed to the addressed being used for registration, I'm sure a mass vaccination event could be run without asking for that either."
12874,I think they might have been slightly smaller because the unemployment levels would not have been nearly as high.
12875,Since so many people weren’t working they were able to go protest.
12876,74 deaths/5800 infections are out of how many people that got 2 shots?
12877,There are 77 million people who got fully vaccinated but the article does not report the exact number of people that this article includes.
12878,So it is also important that if those records are from 100k fully vaccinated people or 10 million fully vaccinated people.
12879,"I could not get any information at that article, does anyone get?"
12880,Younger women got those blood clots the most from AZ.
12881,Seemingly older women are also less at risk just like men.
12882,"As the comment above pointed out you are comparing a number from ""deaths or serious side effects"" to ""deaths"" and then concluding that you are X more likely to die."
12883,Surely side effects are much more common than deaths.
12884,You’re assuming I disagree with you but I don’t.
12885,Thank you so much.
12886,I got some people to talk to then.
12887,Problem is that this number explicitly disagrees with the EMA's estimate and all the other data we have.
12888,Certainly this number is not plausible as an average over the full population.
12889,Also note - CVT risk is much higher from Covid!
12890,My leg muscles were definitely more achey
12891,"because this is America, land of the unaffordable copay"
12892,I’d say that there’s a chance of some slow downs this fall and winter as they craft the booster shot.
12893,But I’d say it’s more the 6th inning.
12894,"And obviously this summer enjoy yourself, things should be broadly normal except international travel and concerts"
12895,Halting the vaccine definitely was not responsible - it's pretty clear that regulators like the FDA are optimising for the appearance of being sensible rather than any rational risk calculus.
12896,1 in 40000 is an obviously wrong number.
12897,Does anyone know if the federal government has a plan to get vaccines out to embassies and consulates for US citizens abroad?
12898,And why wouldn't the city of Kelowna simply put concrete blocks in front of the doors of a business that is operating without a license?
12899,"Yes, between 100% and 67% according to https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/gjgst2/variation_in_falsenegative_rate_of_reverse/

""Over the 4 days of infection before the typical time of symptom onset (day 5), the probability of a false-negative result in an infected person decreases from 100% (95% CI, 100% to 100%) on day 1 to 67% (CI, 27% to 94%) on day 4."
12900,"On the day of symptom onset, the median false-negative rate was 38% (CI, 18% to 65%)."
12901,"This decreased to 20% (CI, 12% to 30%) on day 8 (3 days after symptom onset) then began to increase again, from 21% (CI, 13% to 31%) on day 9 to 66% (CI, 54% to 77%) on day 21."""
12902,"This is an older study, I have seen a newer study saying you should get tested on the day of symptom onset, and the accuracy goes up to 90%."
12903,Username checks out.
12904,Only one person died in 6 million doses.
12905,I'm sure you'll be fine.
12906,"Lolol, but if a private business wants to deny goods or services to someone who is unvaccinated, they have every right to do so"
12907,Delta at least is keeping middle seat blocked until May
12908,wow you got it that fast when you went??
12909,both shots i had to wait 20-30 minutes
12910,Vaccinated people slew older especially as of March
12911,Idiots
12912,"The number of beds is not the most relevant factor anymore, when the people who would work in care around those beds have quit, are suffering, or have died because noone protected them sufficiently."
12913,Agreed.
12914,At least you only have to push it back two days?
12915,&gt; The reality is that the chance of avoiding dying from COVID is about five thousand times greater that the chance of getting a blood clot.
12916,"Not when you are young, healthy and female."
12917,Hardly anyone who fits this description dies of COVID and they are on the other hand really overrepresented among those who got those blood clots from AZ.
12918,"""He said his first repeal would be the mask mandate""

This should be the last restriction to go"
12919,Brag away dude.
12920,UK was heavily criticized as well.
12921,My sister in law told my wife and I that anyone that died of a heart attack or was killed in a car accident was being listed as a covid death to inflate the numbers.
12922,The opposite appears to be happening.
12923,Who should I believe?

12925,Problem is that some hospitals in NJ charge an administration fee of like $50 a shot.
12926,It’s the price they don’t talk about.
12927,I’ll still clean my phone every one or two days.
12928,Sounds like a good idea regardless.
12929,I remember reading some antivax bullshit about people somehow shedding viable live virus from their vaccines.
12930,"So some wackjobs believe that they're going to get the full covid from just the spike protein, and that you could then infect others if you had the vaccine."
12931,"Ironically, these are often the same people who tell you not to worry about the virus and to not wear a mask."
12932,Anytime some article says “we don’t know what’s in it” or “it contains metal particles” just assume it’s misinformation promoted by deliberately misleading scumbags.
12933,If it can be done effectively with life-saving vaccines it can be done with any product or service.
12934,my best friend’s stepdad got the vaccine and did catch corona but it’s because it was within like a week or something and he was exposed elsewhere.
12935,i assume that happened to that coworker as well.
12936,"This is quite high, they seem to have had as many as Michigan and more than Oregon with much smaller population."
12937,Maybe they are counting it differently.
12938,"&gt;Anytime I see an argument where someone says “I don’t want to pay for other people’s care”, I immediately ask them to explain to me how insurance works."
12939,Exactly!
12940,I've been saying this for years!
12941,"The ""I don't want to pay for other people's care"" is a completely nonsensical argument, even when you ignore the utter selfishness of it."
12942,Because that is exactly how insurance works!
12943,"Ugh, it's so frustrating."
12944,"Meanwhile, people are needlessly suffering and dying from preventable conditions."
12945,"Not in Canada, we are currently spacing our doses 4 months apart (unless you have immunocompromising medical conditions) to enable a faster rollout."
12946,But the gap will probably be shortened as our supply pick up.
12947,"""Pausing a vaccine because it might very rarely kill people will decrease vaccine hesitancy"" is the weirdest idea I've seen all pandemic."
12948,Has anyone saying this ever actually met any vaccine hesitant people?
12949,It's way more likely to just cause vaccine sceptics to be suspicious of any vaccine.
12950,"Do you seriously think that the number of vaccine hesitant people who see suspensions of a vaccine out of caution and then decide to take it outweighs the number of people who just hear a snippet of news about authorities suspending a vaccine and then decide not to take any vaccine ""just in case""?"
12951,This seems obviously ridiculous to me - of course this is going to decrease confidence in all vaccines (this is exactly what's happening in the US right now after the J&amp;J suspension).
12952,So what do you want them to do then?
12953,What is your expectation?
12954,They leave on a capacity limit they dont intend that DOES restrict capacity for most because saying 100% isnt always true??
12955,In my analogy you left out the part where not every car can only go 40.
12956,What about the cars who can go 75?
12957,90?
12958,You are saying that because you can only go 40 then the speed limit isnt removed??
12959,It makes no sense.
12960,They are two different restrictions.
12961,Just because they impact eachother doesnt mean they are the same.
12962,Looks like a yoga studio to me
12963,Wasn't the NBA going to do a big PR event where all the players got vaccinated?
12964,What happened to that?
12965,TLDR american healthcare is a crock of shit
12966,"Duh.. 
study finds that social distancing will limit the spread of the free virus."
12967,Study finds that flying on a packed Airbus A380 has higher infection rate than a Cessna 401
12968,Yeah that pause was incredibly stupid on the govt’s part.
12969,Tons of people are already super paranoid about the vaxx
12970,Get vaccinated ASAP with the first vaccine available to you.
12971,The trials results are not necessarily comparable to each other because they took place in different regions at different times.
12972,"In a direct side-by-side comparison, the AZ and Pfizer produced the same level of antibodies, and the AZ had a superior cellular response."
12973,"See https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/mqqil1/single_vaccination_with_bnt162b2_or_chadox1_in/

In real life data, the UK reported that single dose AZ slightly out-performed single dose Pfizer in preventing infection in the elderly."
12974,"See https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/03/pfizer-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccines-may-offer-high-efficacy-elderly ""The investigators found that one dose of the Pfizer vaccine was 57% to 61% effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 after 4 weeks and that the AstraZeneca vaccine was 60% to 73% effective."""
12975,"This may be a better comparison than the trials because the UK used those two vaccines in the same nation as the same time, and it's a fairer head-to-head comparison."
12976,I look forward to seeing their 2 dose data (not available yet because the UK largely delayed the second dose)
12977,I think Covid likes it there too.
12978,"I got my first Pfizer shot two and a half weeks ago, and I'm getting my second shot on Monday."
12979,I still have a bruise from my first shot.
12980,Has anyone else had a bruise that lasted that long?
12981,Should I seek medical attention?
12982,Almost all adults will get a shot before summer.
12983,I expect Canada/Usa borders to be open this summer with a proof of vaccination.
12984,This post appears to be about vaccines.

12987,*
12988,Bolsonaro has blood on his hands
12989,"i thought i was gonna have to pay literally til i got the the wallgreen’s, just assumed because we are in america that we would get charged though admittedly i hadn’t googled the cost or anything"
12990,Maybe even 6 months.
12991,I think people really wanted to rally around the flag.
12992,A little bit of empathy would have sealed it.
12993,But Trump can't be who he isn't.
12994,Precautionary shutdown.
12995,This is really cynical reporting by CBS.
12996,The study's main takeaway is clearly that CVT clots are more common after COVID-19 than after vaccination.
12997,"Now, the thrombocytopenia appears to be missing, so that needs further investigation, but the mortality rate of the two is roughly similar."
12998,done - thank you for flagging that.
12999,Quite right - weed out the weak!
13000,The theater I went to was probably 40% capacity.
13001,"It was more than I was comfortable with, but that's part of dipping your toes back into society after being vaccinated and trusting the science."
13002,I didnt feel safe going and risking it prior to getting the shot.
13003,And hopefully the vaccine is making for less severe cases too.
13004,The government isn’t doling out passports to enter buildings on whether I’ve tried weed or not
13005,They also can't force US military to get vaccinated without a full approval.
13006,"Probably same thing in other situations where they'd typically vaccinate, like the unaccompanied minors at the border."
13007,Except we aren’t limited by supply right now and those 10M can go get a different vaccine.
13008,They don’t?
13009,"They should cause it’s much safer than getting Covid 


*ok I think the analogy is beyond broken by now*"
13010,Let’s also not forget that the British public has done exceptionally well in following the lockdown rules for almost 4 months now.
13011,Yes people run to pubs and Primark like zombies the moment we reopened but people had shown exceptional restraint so far.
13012,Nothing short of amazing where we are at the moment.
13013,If Trump had managed to be presidential for just one year I think that would have helped the down ballot candidates and probably kept the senate for the republicans.
13014,Millions of pairs of single use gloves and hand sanitizer bottles later.
13015,I think you're under estimating the number of people who view going back to normal as a lightswitch.
13016,"I know for me, minus masking in public stores etc for a little while, I'm going right back to normal."
13017,"Thanks, looking forward to the second dose being easier."
13018,"Some media organizations are clickbaiting, sure."
13019,Many others are just reporting what scientists tell them.
13020,It’s been already paid for so they no reason not to.
13021,"As far as your speed limit analogy, I remember back when there used to be all those people arguing how wearing a seat belt is bad because in a crash you want to be thrown out of the car rather than burn a fiery death."
13022,I guess they also thought cars explode on impact like in the movies.
13023,People don't change much.
13024,They'll believe a lot of crazy shit to reduce cognitive dissonance and avoid anxiety.
13025,Part of the reason why the car manufacturers had to be regulated into providing decent seatbelts was because they didn't have enough consumer pressure.
13026,Not if they're a head of state.
13027,You don't want your leader dying of a perfectly avoidable virus.
13028,Congratulations.
13029,"Unfortunately due to the way i was raised, i cant be ignorant like you."
13030,"Also, im educated in the matter to know that the vaccine went through the proper steps to get a EUA and its not just you that is at risk, but also the people you come into contact with."
13031,"If you are more worried about the vaccine than covid, well that says everything i need to know."
13032,Luckily that way of thinking is in the minority for obvious reasons.
13033,Is the fear overblown?
13034,Probably.
13035,But the concern is that there are variance in efficacy in vaccine when variants are infecting the population.
13036,Pfizer and Moderna seems to be most effective in this area but that’s why experts are keeping eye on things.
13037,May be something to do with Covid.
13038,I can already see the advertisement.
13039,3 week stay minimum.
13040,Get one shot on the way in and one on the way out.
13041,"No, you don't understand."
13042,"They run the trials until, say, 300 people are infected and then stop and compare the control group to the vaccinated group."
13043,"If there are a lot of cases where the trials are conducted, getting to those 300 people will take less time."
13044,But it doesn't change the ratio or the data.
13045,Sadly I have kids who can’t get vaccinated yet
13046,"good, thanks for the info"
13047,Without the eu canada would be in shambles.
13048,We now know who our true friends are.
13049,We certainly wont forget
13050,Plus a lot of non European countries are getting their vaccines from europe because the us production isnt being exported.
13051,"Canada got some AZ vaccines from the usa because the usa had them, but it wasn't even fda approved and they were going to expire."
13052,So canada got some in exchange for vaccines later.
13053,"Canada literally has to pay back in vaccines...

Canada is isn't giving the second dose right away anymore."
13054,Just isn't enough vaccines to do two so we are delaying second dose quite a long time.
13055,"Yeah, the head of intensive care units in the netherlands is furious about stopping wit AZ and trombose experts also say that they don't understand why the government acts the way it does."
13056,"We have almsot 800 people with covid on IC and 400 normal ones, which is at like max capacity due to personnel shortage (not machine shortage)."
13057,And it's like that for months now around 700-800.
13058,Nurses are exhausted and many are thinking ablut quiting.
13059,"I would get the AZ tomorrow, but it isn't allowed."
13060,Now they are just laying somewhere unused for all under 60.
13061,"I like this take, and I do think that day is coming relatively soon, when reasonable people collectively relax."
13062,People throw around the May/June timeframe here and that seems right.
13063,What happened with AZ and the Gates foundation?
13064,[removed]
13065,"Lol can’t tell of serious or typical la redditor sarcasm, but the way I have seen the whole social media/covid fanatics change their entire lives and demand that everyone else do too has made me a lot more cynical than ever before."
13066,"If I was an elder or a person who unluckily had other health conditions- then maybe, but I don’t."
13067,And even then.
13068,It wouldn’t be a “pandemic” if everyone could just mask up and survive lol.
13069,It’s a pandemic cause it’s gonna kill people
13070,A lot of the less educated population thinks of J&amp;J as a traditional style vaccine.
13071,"Plenty of the older white males that lean right politically were willing to take j&amp;j, but not the mrna ones due to conspiracy theories"
13072,"Doesn't matter what people say, listen to the scientists."
13073,"We don't practice that stuff for everyday disease because we have herd immunity, not like everyone gets Polio who is unvaccinated."
13074,Yeah but the way they've been doing it here they'll call out over the store intercom asking if anyone wants one.
13075,"So unless you're in the store at the time, you're not getting it."
13076,Most people here don't realize they could get one and are just going by state guidelines.
13077,Then throw in how they ask for an insurance card and it makes people think it's not free.
13078,"Oh there will be people pushing that, they should be ignored."
13079,This is the real argument.
13080,I have a surpressed immune system and I got the first Astra vaccine before the Australian government advises not to get it if you're under 50.
13081,"If the other option was don't get vaccinated, I'd get vaccinated 50 times over."
13082,And I've had a autoimmune reaction to drugs that's 2 per million.
13083,You might survive covid but the ever lasting effects can still screw with your life.
13084,Herd immunity doesn't mean that it stops existing.
13085,It means that you don't have large chains of infection.
13086,It's not a binary where you hit herd immunity and the virus disappears.
13087,You'll still have pockets of it.
13088,"In places where people don't vaccinate at high levels, your odds of being part of the cohort needed to achieve herd immunity are pretty high."
13089,"Assuming the estimates of 70-80% are right, odds are you'll be in either the infection group or the vaccination group."
13090,This is especially true given that we're being told that we'll need boosters annually.
13091,"Take off, eh!!!"
13092,😁
13093,Agreed.
13094,"There's also going to be an overreaction to the first severe case because people don't realize ""100% effective in preventing severe cases"" actually has an implied ""in the trial"" after it."
13095,"I wish the messaging were a little more nuanced, but I guess many people would just get confused by that and turn to simpler messaging."
13096,Is the booster shot to extend current immunity or to fight new virus variants?
13097,It's safe.
13098,"The CDC's guidelines are that vaccinated households can have unvaccinated people from at most one other household indoors with them, maskless."
13099,This is literally the trolley problem come to life.
13100,And the answer is you fucking switch the tracks.
13101,No thank you.
13102,"I agree, but I love ramen too so I might be an outlier."
13103,I'm on the first shot of AZ right now.
13104,Hope this isn't my last post.
13105,"I feel fine, get my second in a month."
13106,"""we don't know the risks, so let's extrapolate anyway, hooray!"""
13107,No it means that 5% of the vaccinated population will get COVID.
13108,"So if 1,000 out of 1,000,000 people will get COVID without vaccinations, if you vaccinate that entire population of 1,000,000, only 50 will still get it."
13109,It would be safe per CDC guidelines.
13110,Where meeting maskless and only one party is unvaccinated is okay as long as everyone else is vaccinated.
13111,"MI's case counts are at best flat, unfortunately."
13112,It's still going strong here.
13113,"A lot of the worst counties have flattened at a high rate, while others that were at a moderate rate are seeing increases."
13114,See [here](https://covidactnow.org/us/michigan-mi/?s=1755676).
13115,You are making it sound like a good thing
13116,Obnoxious formatting on your paragraph separation
13117,The issue here was people coming too early.
13118,"I did mine yesterday and it took longer showing my appointment barcode (3 times, scanned twice) and driving through the cones setup."
13119,"Then the 15-30 min wait but it was very smooth, everyone was nice and verbose on instructions."
13120,Lucky that COVID-19 isn’t from a lab...otherwise it would be lethal &amp; transmissible /s 🤯
13121,"Nah, their voices and opinions count too."
13122,[removed]
13123,[removed]
13124,That’s not how efficacy works
13125,So are we supposed to lock down untill everyone decides to get vaccinated?
13126,At some point we'll have to accept the risks.
13127,"Unless you want to round up all the antivaxers and put a shot in them by force, some amount of covid will exist."
13128,"Mutations will happen, boosters will be had."
13129,"Eat well, drink water, excercise, get your vax and hope for the best."
13130,The *safety* is not the issue.
13131,The *permission* is.
13132,"Tell people they can get together and have a barbecue with no masks and that if someone asks them to mask up they're allowed to tell them where to go, and then you've given them an incentive."
13133,[removed]
13134,"&gt;90% efficacy means that if half the country is vaccinated and there are 100,000 daily cases, then 10,000 of them would be vaccinated people."
13135,"10,000 people who for the most part will not get seriously sick or go to the hospital."
13136,"Also, areas with higher vaccination rates will almost certainly have less cases so in practice it will be less than 10,000."
13137,This is what we see in Israel.
13138,"Well, that's not what 95% efficacy means."
13139,95% efficacy means that 95% of the people who would have gotten the virus without a vaccine will now not get it.
13140,[removed]
13141,"Look up covid vaccine tracker, select NH."
13142,56% of the population has received at least one dose
13143,"Be sure to leave your shoes at home, too."
13144,"But say for those people that either will choose to attempt to evade covid until the end of time, is it possible they just do it long enough until here immunity and then the chances become low enough that they will be able to get neither and be fine?"
13145,I dunno.
13146,I think masks are cool.
13147,Makes me feel like the Blue Bandit.

13157,"Up until the vaccine rollout, I don't think Israel's handling of the coronavirus can exactly be considered a success."
13158,We had one of the highest infection rates in the world last autumn (albeit with a very low morbidity rate) and by the third lockdown this winter there was widespread flouting of the rules.
13159,"I do think that we've done better than a lot of countries in terms of distancing and getting businesses to adapt their spaces for the situation, but by the time the vaccines were rolled out a lot of the population was complacent/had given up on the rules."
13160,"There are no odds in this list at all, just categories."
13161,With vastly different probabilities for each outcome.
13162,"Also similar is, only so many people have been affected."
13163,Back at the beginning of all this in the UK everyone was saying only so many infected on so many dead.
13164,That’s because it wasn’t well established yet.
13165,What happens now with AZ when people go for the booster or 5 months down the line when the immune systems responds to something.
13166,"What’s the risk of death of covid, what’s the risk of severe disease, what’s the risk of bloods clots?"
13167,All are very small so why risk anyone having this response to AZ
13168,5800 out of 66 *million* got infected.
13169,That's slightly under 0.01%.
13170,"And of those 5800, 74 died, which is 1%."
13171,So your chances of dying after you've been vaccinated is 0.0001%.
13172,These statistics are just insane.
13173,"The vaccines are nothing short of miracles and once we can get these damn logistical challenges out of the way and if governments could take their heads out of their asses (see: Europe), this pandemic should be completely over."
13174,Rather just live my life.
13175,Haven’t thought about covid in over 8 months.
13176,I’m also not an at risk age group - I would be more worried about an in finished clinical trial vaccine than the covid flu
13177,It doesn't happen only to women.
13178,"It seems to happen more to women, but even that isn't certain, because more women have taken the AZ vaccine so far."
13179,The bad news is that there's going to be a vocal minority who demands masking and social distancing perpetually now.
13180,Not sure where you go those numbers.
13181,I'm showing 26.7% of NH being vaccinated.
13182,Seems a little trigger happy to me.
13183,"Yes, basically."
13184,You'll either stay vaccinated or eventually odds are that you'll get COVID at some point.
13185,"The word ""endemic"" is being spoken for a reason."
13186,It's not going away.
13187,"https://twitter.com/ayeeee_samii/status/1382758630689173506?s=21

This is the messaging I see regarding the vaccine all over the place."
13188,They have completed failed with vaccine messaging and all it’s doing is fueling anti vax people and making the return to normal that much harder.

13190,Ship them to Canada and Latin America.
13191,Eight times a number so small it would be rounded to 0.
13192,Fear-mongerimg
13193,I don't know what that is.
13194,"I get a flu shot most years, but the flu doesn't generally get reported on very much."
13195,"IF we need Covid boosters, hopefully it will be at that level of interest in a few years."
13196,Do you feel it’s an inevitability to either get Covid or the vaccine?
13197,Like is it one or the other?
13198,I wonder about the age of the 4 dead people...
13199,"I understand the argument, but where's the data that poor mask usage increases the risk of catching COVID?"
13200,"Yeah, the guy who masked his face but left his nose dangling in the wind is a jackass."
13201,But isn't covering the mouth give him greater protection than nothing at all?
13202,"Or the guy who fiddles with his mask makes some sense that he might be creating another vector, but is that guy touching his face materially increasing his risk for COVID, especially as we know that the spread is probably driven by floating droplets and poor ventilation?"
13203,Why wouldn’t you?
13204,"It’s free, it’s accessible, and it may lead to a sore arm and a few days of feeling sick at most vs. a potentially far longer and more serious case if you were to contract COVID."
13205,"Plus, the more people get vaccinated as quickly as possible, the faster your area will be in a position to lift restitutions."
13206,Every person vaccinated is closer to herd immunity so why wouldn’t you do your part to contribute if you want restrictions eased ASAP?
13207,"Holy shit, I was expecting it to be low but thats *strikingly* low."
13208,This vaccine is serious stuff.
13209,what would you say would be the average daily case count when the pandemic ends?
13210,I think in the US it would matter who it was.
13211,A state legislator jumping the line would be roasted.
13212,A Senator or Congressman doing the same would probably get the same treatment.
13213,If the President did it he'd get shit from the other party just because that's how politics work these days but I don't think any of us common folks would mind.
13214,This guy has his finger on the nuclear trigger.
13215,He should probably be as healthy as we can keep him.
13216,So basically like a second flu shot every year?
13217,I'm going to start walking into every store without a shirt on and say I'm being discriminated against if I'm asked to leave.
13218,I just got my second dose yesterday and this is by far the worst vaccine side effects I’ve ever had.
13219,It definitely feels like the flu.
13220,"Fever, chills, body aches all over..."
13221,"I am very pro-vaccine, but right now, I’d be lying if I said I’m not hesitant on getting a booster."
13222,I suppose I may change my mind when I’m not feeling like this?

13232,"When it was still in development I would constantly see pictures of a random Oxford scientist saying ""this is the person working to save humanity"" but never anything for the other vaccines."
13233,Over half of the entire population has received at least one dose.
13234,"Also, and more importantly, 100% of people in new hampshire are eligible and able to get an appointment to get vaccinated."

13243,"5% of vaccinated people will still get Covid, statistically."
13244,But people are stupid.
13245,"They will justify injecting the vaccine ""gives you a chance"" of blood clot, and also just take their chances of not getting covid."
13246,He's right though.
13247,Haha so true.
13248,"Ok you all are vaccinated but keep the masks on is not the best way to convince people to get a vaccine, especially the younger ones."
13249,"Aggravated with Costco, local store showed up as starting to vaccinate earlier this week after my J&amp;J shot was canceled."
13250,"Site didn't say if it was Phizer or Moderna just ""Covid Dose 1""."
13251,Arrived a bit ago to get my vaccine and they said they'd canceled it because all they ever had was J&amp;J.
13252,They had no explanation for why they let folks sign up after J&amp;J was to be canceled and J&amp;K was pulled from every other distribution sign up.

13270,why does that matter?
13271,I don’t understand why this bothers people.
13272,"Sometimes I find myself doing this because it’s chilly, or I pulled it up to pass some people and then forgot about it, or my hands were busy texting or picking up dog poop and I haven’t had a chance to pull it down yet, or it’s just easier to remember it if you put it on when you leave the house, and take it off when you return."
13273,I'm in the Northern part of the state and can confirm the desire to get the vaccine here is really high.
13274,My neighborhood FB group continually shares stories about sites in Southwestern VA and cities by the VA/NC border that were lowkey doing walk in clinics because of the lack of demand down there and people were offering to do carpools and stuff to these sites to get vaccinated.
13275,"I don't know if VA pharmacies are stricter than other states or if there is just no leftover doses up here, but I haven't heard of anyone just being able to get a walk in extra dose the way I've heard in other states."

13282,"Businesses don't want to scare off customers and risk an outbreak of their employees, so they require vaccinations."
13283,None of this is illegal or immoral.
13284,"Plus, by various groups following their own self-interest, society as a whole benefits."
13285,Then what?
13286,You recover and keep living lol
13287,"I’m curious - does this mean that 70% of the population would have to get a booster shot each year, so that we can live a normal life without lockdowns and such?"
13288,For most people it's quite mild.
13289,If it's not then you need the shot if you get it badly once your reasonably likely to get it again badly.
13290,"and for those wondering, bidens first 100 days ends on april 30th, which means he got about 14 days to administer 22 million doses."

13292,now tell this to those moron anti-vaxx
13293,Some do.
13294,But we can’t wait around all year being worried about “others”.
13295,Especially when those others are 65 years old who lives their lives already without shutting down their life for 1+ years.
13296,Harsh truth
13297,"According to Bloomberg, 115 million doses were exported under the EU's export control regime."
13298,"Add to that exports to Covax, Israel and a dozen other countries not subject to the controls, at least 140 million doses have been exported from the EU so far."
13299,Here's a hot take: a vaccine for Covid shouldn't result in a potential death for young healthy people.
13300,It should be 0.
13301,"It's not required to get though, and there's a lot of talk in congress about making this required."
13302,"Some people had terrible side effects, so excuse them for not wanting to put up with that every year because it's mandatory."
13303,"Sure it's better than having to lockdown the world again, but that doesn't mean you can't complain about it."
13304,Also you gotta realize there are some people out there just terrified of getting shots.
13305,"So yea, they may not be that happy about finding out they have to get it every year now."

13330,Except most developing countries won't without changes to the protocols for maintaining them.
13331,So not sure why you expect that.

13350,I'm certain I'll be wearing a mask everywhere I go until at least this time next year.
13351,I agree.
13352,I think there are a lot of people who would have been vaccinated if they could have been if targeted better.

13357,Which is pretty useless considering covid rates of transmission are extremely low in an outdoor setting
13358,Yes
13359,The metals you speak of aren't actually dangerous.
13360,They just sound scary to people who are easily misled.
13361,The ingredients in normal vaccines are safe too.
13362,mRNA is certainly an awesome technology with wide reaching applications and relatively easy to modify to counter other existing and future threats so it's really cool technology!

13389,your point sounded like you think that cnbc was trying to panic people.
13390,"what actually happened was that the article wasnt well written, which is very different from them trying to panic people since again, the ceo of pfizer said exactly what cnbc put in the headline"
13391,"No, like half the population"
13392,Isn’t that why he said “in the US”?

13403,I love these posts.
13404,It's nice to have something to cheer for.
13405,When do you all predict virus cases will trend down.
13406,My guess is May 1 they start declining as it's 2 weeks after most states had it available to everyone eligible.
13407,"Plus, warm weather."
13408,This number also doesn't include exports to countries such as Israel that are not on the EU's list of export controls.

13410,"How’s aboot send to Canada please, m’kay thanks so much, eh 🇨🇦"
13411,That's a good reason to avoid situations where you could contract a contagious respiratory infection.
13412,I wanna go visit my friend and his girlfriend (who are both fully vaccinated) at their apartment and hang out there with all of us maskless.
13413,I am only partially vaccinated.
13414,Would it be safe to go?
13415,"I live at home with my dad and my brother who are both partially vaccinated as well, along with a couple renters whose vaccination status and risk factors are unknown."

13434,I got very mild T from my first dose of Moderna.
13435,"I joined a support group for other people who got it (before yall say I'm a crazy antivaxxer, I'm not, I'm extremely pro vaccines, even my ENT and gp and the pharmacist who gave me my shot all agreed this is a side effect after getting reports of sudden T from others, it's also a rare but reported side effect for some of the vaccines, overall covid is much more likely to give you T)."

13446,As in barely think about it for anyone below 65?
13447,Can we please fat forward already
13448,I don't understand how that is possible because they didn't test people.
13449,They only looked at severe cases.
13450,"Look at the previous page, for example:

&gt;In the all-available efficacy population, ten participants had severe COVID-19 disease after Dose 1"
13451,That's not a cult or even cult-like behavior.
13452,That's just ignorance.
13453,Searching for 2 minutes on Google can show you that you need a certain quality of mask for them to be effective.
13454,"Those people are especially big pieces of shit because they are just trying to play along so they don't get flack for not wearing a mask, yet while still being a risk to everyone around them."
13455,Selfish cowards in every sense of the words.
13456,Unlikely.
13457,With flu you just get whatever the best shot is that year (or most likely best shot).
13458,I imagine it will be similar with COVID vaccines.
13459,There's also research going on now to determine if getting a shot from different types of vaccines actually gives you *better* protection.
13460,So a vaccine with an efficacy rate of 90% is poor at protecting me?
13461,Is the United States (and company) supposed to self sabotage and give vaccines to everyone else before protecting its own citizens?
13462,It’s like an airplane.
13463,You’re supposed to put your own mask on in an emergency event before helping others- even children.
13464,Most of the world do...
13465,No need for three words when one will do:  Morons remain hesitant....
13466,Doesn’t help that when you go get it they try to fight you over a pharmacy benefits card.
13467,Told them I don’t have one.
13468,It’s included in my work healthcare.
13469,They tried to give me shit about it until I finally asked “If the vaccine is free then why do you need to see my insurance card???
13470,?” That stopped the conversation immediately and they took me back.
13471,"While the virus is still highly prevalent in society,  I would prefer not to play an immunogenic version of Russian Roulette if I am not forced to."
13472,"Thanks, but as I mentioned in another comment, that quote was not in the article when I posted."
13473,The entire article was literally a paragraph.
13474,Usually 5-10 thousand miles depending ..which is much more than a few thousand.
13475,Also EVs are a thing
13476,I get it i really do.
13477,But when studies show those who live healthy and active have about 98% survival rate and they only preach vaccines its sus.
13478,Tomorrow I will be 7 days post 2nd dose of Pfizer.
13479,Going to take my family for outdoor eating this weekend i think.
13480,Not at all.
13481,Imagine you’re a tepid vaccine taker and for months the CDC has been telling you that these vaccines are safe and that they’ve done huge safety trials on tens of thousands of people and are totally confident that the vaccines are safe.
13482,"Three months later, the CDC says “well actually, we need to take a pause because we’re not so sure” after millions have already been vaccinated."
13483,"To those people, it feels like a betrayal."
13484,"It’s easy for us educated people to say “yeah it’s one in a million chance” and “yeah this about the worst the vaccine can do you”, but to those people who know nothing about vaccines, they’re losing their trust in the CDC who months ago told them everything was safe."
13485,"That quote was added to the article long after I posted my comment, which is exactly my point."
13486,That was fucking dumb.
13487,There isnt even a comparison in terms of efficacy.

13492,That's for if you had it weeks or months ago.
13493,Do you mean an antigen test?
13494,Nice try flipping the script after you’ve been buried.

13528,That's why I never liked this proposition.
13529,"The individuals who say ""it's too early, let's wait another month to remove mask mandates/restrictions"" are not saying ""Let's remove the restrictions in a month!"
13530,""", rather they are saying ""Let's wait for a month, see what the situation is and re-evaluate then""."
13531,Which is fair as long as you say what the metrics for removing mask mandates/restrictions are.
13532,"I would like concrete realistic metrics, not something vague like ""low spread""."
13533,"So when you say ""It's too early to end restrictions"", you have to say what metrics you have in your mind, then we can a healthy debate about the metrics."
13534,Hmmm I work for x institution and that institution has been beaten up lately about a vaccine.
13535,My reputation is tied to the institution.
13536,I’m not saying there is malice but to dismiss any bias would be ridiculous.
13537,"I totally feel you ,  I was very fortunate to get Pfizer back in December through my job, and after a year of treating Covid patients , wearing N95's everywhere it felt like a massive victory."
13538,People seem to never consider morbidity and only mortality.
13539,Look what polio did to the people it didn't kill.
13540,Thankfully all of my family qualified for vaccination and feb and most got moderna and some Pfizer.
13541,These mRNA vaccines have proven to be nothing but safe and EXTREMLY effective.
13542,"Not really, no."
13543,Not as far as I know.
13544,"Also, I live in France, we have quite a high level of mask compliance here."
13545,"Kids just don't like wearing the mask, that's really it , at least mine."
13546,"Also, kindergarten kids don't wear masks in France, so that can't be an issue."
13547,"Jesus, dude, you think."
13548,Social distancing makes 100% capacity impossible.
13549,Therefore the 100% capacity restriction has not been lifted and has no application is the real world.
13550,Silly rules like this will just allow law enforcement to arbitrarily decide when and when not to harrass a business.
13551,No cars can go over 40 in your analogy.
13552,"Every car is limited to 40, just like every place is limited by social distancing, which doesn't allow 100% capacity."
13553,You are being silly.
13554,"No place can do 100% capacity, therefore there is a restriction on 100% capacity."
13555,Period.
13556,"Um no, they're talking about these specific rare type of clots."
13557,"The rate of these type of clots is not extremely high in Covid, but it is 8 times higher risk than the vaccination."
13558,"Of course, Covid can also cause other types of clots, strokes, heart attacks, respiratory failure, organ damage, neurological damage and has killed millions of people worldwide from babies to old people."
13559,Not to mention to social and economic damage from the pandemic and mental health issues.
13560,For the EU probably more like 5.
13561,The vaccine roll out is going real bad.
13562,This is a damned if you do damned if you don’t situation.
13563,Confidence is going to fall whether it’s paused or essentially ignored.
13564,You just have to follow the procedures and pause it and notify everyone that the issue is being investigated.
13565,"Also, it's weird to compare blood clots to blood clots."
13566,They really should compare all organ damage of COVID vs AZ.
13567,Or deaths.
13568,"If the vaccine was 1/8 as dangerous, I don't know if that risk is with it or not (what are the chances you will get COVID before a safer vaccine is available?"
13569,Might be less than 1/8).
13570,But it's way less dangerous
13571,"I'm sure there are, but laws are written and enforced by those with money and power."
13572,Florida is also a right to work state so you can be fired for anything they they will make up an excuse.
13573,"When Covid started a group of ICU nurses were complaining about the lack of PPE and how the CDC at the time said it's not airborne, so you don't need negative pressure rooms or N95/duckbill/CAPR masks."
13574,So they all got fired.
13575,"Needless to say, once my wife finishes her DNP, we are getting the fuck out of Florida."
13576,"So when they calculate these “8x’s more likely” numbers are they including estimated  asymptomatic cases or just symptomatic, positive tested COVID cases?"

13584,"It's very odd to me, I didn't know about the risks until I took the vaccine (I have an elevated risk of blood clots because a number of factors) and suffered blood clot symptoms that I didn't at all expect and no one warned me of."
13585,( I took johnson and johnson).
13586,"After a hospital visit, still suffering from the effects of it, people need to know the risks."
13587,"I'm still numb over half my body with extreme muscle pain, and realize I would have preferred to stay careful myself."
13588,People do really weird things to further ingrate themselves in their own beliefs.
13589,Especially when those beliefs aren't really based on anything other then feelings.
13590,"&gt;Pfizer seems like one of the best and safest vaccines

Not for 2nd and 3rd world countries that account for a much larger percentage of the world's population who can't afford the higher price and the higher cost of storage."
13591,Agree but maybe for a decision like this input from someone with that expertise might be beneficial.
13592,This is a completely fabricated example but say 10 million people don’t take the vaccine because of this pause what does that translate to in net change in loss of lives?
13593,I don’t know that answer but it’s a reasonable thing to expect them to evaluate but to evaluate accurately you really would need input from a behavioral scientist.
13594,"That’s my point, not that this is the right or wrong call but that these decisions don’t exist in a vacuum."
13595,I feel the same way.
13596,I was in Moderna’s phase 3 clinical trial last summer and it’s super cool to think I was one of the first people in the world to receive an mRNA vaccine.
13597,If these vaccines end up being effective against HIV or cancer then I’m getting a NCT04470427 tattoo.
13598,"This is Lower Saxony, which typically, is lagging behind."
13599,"Looking at the stats https://www.n-tv.de/panorama/Alle-Daten-alle-Fakten-zur-Corona-Impfung-article22249335.html   
   
Bremen has completed vaccination for 6.6% of gen-pop."
13600,"That's not going to be 40% of 60+  
1st shot is 20.9% - so maybe?"
13601,bout time
13602,"I would say it's just as likely as the statement the other commenter made, that we will actually achieve herd immunity, let alone the fact that herd immunity in no way means the virus is eradicated."
13603,"There is the other PR nightmare of ""the government knew that the J&amp;J vaccine could cause blood clots and did nothing"" and I just can't tell which is more damaging to peoples perception of vaccine safety."
13604,Maybe they should've paused only for women but I'm not sure thats much better.
13605,Just wait until it spits it's dummy out due to political gains and kills more of it's citizens again.
13606,Did AstraZeneca pay this subreddit to defend it over everything??
13607,There are other vaccines with no controversial stories ffs
13608,[removed]
13609,Good job UK.
13610,I am curious about the ratio of people in London who has antibody now.
13611,[removed]
13612,[removed]
13613,"I believe Pfizer and Moderna ran studied with the British, SA and Brazilian variant and although there was a reduction in neutralizing antibodies, it was still more than enough for clinical efficacy."
13614,I'll try and find the papers I read for that.
13615,No it isn't.
13616,You were talking about Israel.
13617,They use Pfizer exclusively - so you need to get your examples straight.
13618,The other ones need a lot more work.. and time to be perfected.. as I say.
13619,Countries that can quarantine at their borders should do so for as long as it remains cost effective.
13620,"It's very cost effective at current, considering the alternative."
13621,And you're starting to become rude... if you can't speak with respect I think we should stop.
13622,Perfect answer.
13623,And adding to this.
13624,Covid comes out of the chaos that is nature.
13625,Astrazeneca  is a freely given out vaccine by the gouvernement.
13626,The government killing its own citizens.
13627,Corona killing random people.
13628,Its a huge difference even if its on a 1 in a 1000.000 scale.
13629,All eyes are fixed on vaccines.
13630,There is enough anti vaxing going on.
13631,Governments have to make sure that the citizens still believe them.
13632,"There is a very big difference between using it ""just for fun"" e.g."
13633,"easier sex, or as a therapy for medical issues like a migraine, I agree."
13634,"Even if we now see the pill primary as a medical instrument for migraine and stuff (and sorry, this is absolutely NOT what it is used for in the most cases), there is still a discrepancy between a med that will cure a single person and a med or vaccine that helps to end a pandemic."
13635,"So you are right,  this is what Iam trying to say, too."
13636,"AZ or now Johnson get stopped or banned over and over again, while the pill is highly popular and most doctors will give it out as if they are smarties, although there are many known and proven riscs."
13637,This isn't peer reviewed.
13638,That is all you  need to know.
13639,The CDC was 100% certain yesterday.
13640,This sounds like some slapped together paper with uneven data sets to make AZ look better
13641,Throughout the world it's looking like BioNTech has this whole thing figured out so much better than everyone else.
13642,"The government has repeatedly said that the Pfizer shipment arrives on time, in one batch, every single week."
13643,The MHRA has [already investigated and found no difference](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/mhra-issues-new-advice-concluding-a-possible-link-between-covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca-and-extremely-rare-unlikely-to-occur-blood-clots) between male and female.
13644,The skewing of cases towards women is due to more women having received the AZ vaccine.
13645,"When the data is adjusted to account for that, the clotting risks are the same for men and women."
13646,You should also be careful taking low dose aspirin unless advised by a doctor.
13647,Generally it is only recommended and seen as beneficial for those over 65 as the potential side effects outweigh the benefits before then.
13648,"Of course, personal circumstances may change that."
13649,"&gt;Northern Mariana Islands : increase from 0 yesterday to 1 today (increase of 1)

Guys i think we should go back into full lockdown, Northern Mariana Islands  saw an infinite percent increase in cases."
13650,"Mild inconvenience is still an inconvenience, and it will annoy people to varying levels."
13651,"You are applying your feelings on the world but everyone is different, with different tolerances, so you can’t do that logically."
13652,"So I tested positive for both antibodies on monday and then negative for PCR on wednesday, still they tell me I have to wait till the 19th to take another PCR test."
13653,"Im not sure if I have it, but right now Im experiencing a lot of nausea."
13654,How common is this symptom?
13655,"Is it even a symptom, its not on the official CDC symptom list but I heard elsewhere that it was."
13656,"I think the issue here is the combination of blood clots and low platelets, leading to the standard first line treatment for clots (blood thinners) actually leading to serious injury or death."
13657,"If it was just 'normal' clots, they'd issue guidance to keep an eye out for them and follow standard treatment procedure if any patients get them - but in this case, doing the standard treatment is dangerous and doctors will need to know, if a patient presents with clotting, whether they've been vaccinated with J&amp;J or AZ recently."
13658,Donate?
13659,Buyers are already lining up.
13660,[removed]
13661,I think this is a great point.
13662,"Many people are making it seem that that vaccine has absolutely no risk, or that the risks of the vaccine greatly outweigh the risks of COVID."
13663,"However,  risk profiles can vary from person to person."
13664,"I would question whether it is ""worth it"" to inject young, healthy people with a vaccine that could potentially harm them."
13665,"On the other hand, if you are 70+ or have other comorbidities, getting a vaccine makes more sense."
13666,"A friend told me everyone should get the vaccine, *even if it may harm them*, for the ""benefit of society""."
13667,"This is also a tricky ethical question, and I'm not sure where I stand."
13668,Not everything is so black&amp;white as people make it seem.
13669,Go go go New Zealand.
13670,There is a reason why Jacinda is loved a lot.
13671,In many countries leaders actually wait until is their turn (probably for PR).
13672,"Here in Sweden of all our ministers only one, the EU-minister has been vaccinated as he is 73."
13673,The king and queen are also vaccinated but they are also in their 70s.
13674,PhD literally me Doctor of philosophy.
13675,"It doesn't mean you studied philosophy, it's just the historical name we give to that degree"
13676,Increased clotting is well described in COVID patients.
13677,"Problem is that virtually all hospitalized COVID patients receive heparin, and the CVT clots they develop are due to heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)."
13678,"However, they do seem to be much more likely to develop HIT than non-COVID patients receiving heparin."
13679,And a small percentage will develop HIT without heparin exposure.
13680,I’m really interested to see what the data says.
13681,"Explain how the 6 authors have a direct conflict of interest, simply because another group of people in another part of the university designed the vaccine."
13682,He is a PhD and that PhD is in pharmaceutical engineering.
13683,That probably makes him more qualified than the average MD to talk about this...
13684,"If you have the choice to take the AZ vaccine now but you want to wait for the Pfizer vaccine, you're gambling that you won't contract Covid during that time, which carries a much higher risk of killing you and causing long lasting health problems."
13685,I don’t like that either.
13686,It’s because they erased the original series and replaced it with... whatever this is.
13687,It’s just so rude.
13688,People who took the vaccine ARE the study
13689,"this was known a long time ago, healthy people are not getting sick or dying"
13690,Great so add six months on to whatever time line they give.
13691,"Remember, folks, it’s just two weeks so we can have a nice Christmas."
13692,What age bracket's are Germany vaccinating now?
13693,you do for a while after being fully vaccinated with COVID vaccines.
13694,Most people do.
13695,"I had never heard about the viral load, and have been operating since February 2020 under the presumption that a single particle of the virus can be harmful."
13696,"But if a viral load is required, what happens to a smaller load of particles that enter the lungs?"
13697,"Do they sit dormant in the lungs, and become expelled through coughing or exhaling?"
13698,Does the body's immune system attack them?
13699,Thanks for your comment.
13700,I can’t believe (or maybe I can) that our media and public health betters haven’t framed it this way.
13701,"J&amp;j was tested after all the covid variants were a thing, the other vaccines were tested before."
13702,I was reading that they’re all likely equally effective.
13703,[deleted]
13704,What are you talking about every study literally says the mRNA vaccines have 96% immunity after 14 days.
13705,"I’m not going out and having orgies with strangers but you can be damn sure I’ll be back at restaurants, hanging out with friends and going to the gym again."
13706,I would wait for one of the two superior ones unless I had a job that required in person work.
13707,"Yeah I've specifically told a doctor I want a routine, annual physical."
13708,Apparently we said some magic words that coded the visit differently and I got billed for $200.
13709,"To take my height, weight, and blood pressure."
13710,HELTH.
13711,"But it's not just blood clots, covid also causes death in other ways, as well as causes debilitating disease and permanent damage at a much much higher rate."
13712,I'm pulling numbers out of my ass because I don't remember exact ones...
13713,But doesn't covid cause ER-level health issues in 5% of people?
13714,That's 50K/million.
13715,Juuuuust a bit higher than a handful of blood clots per million.
13716,Because otherwise you have to pretend it's not silly to have a faster than light star ship that's less sophisticated than a 2021 Prius.
13717,I'd much rather have a bit of canon discontinuity than have the show disappear up its own ass trying to explain why we have teleportation but not LCD screens!
13718,&gt; It sounds like it is a way of dropping it without saying that we're dropping it.
13719,This seems like the most considerate and sane thing to do.
13720,"Even if some of the low-population EU countries can manage without it, others in the EU are being hit harder and need all the help they can get, and 1 country openly declaring that they want nothing to do with X vaccine raises awkward questions for those continuing to use it."
13721,"Quietly suspending it indefinitely avoids that, if it has to be done."
13722,It's a shame that Denmark wasn't equally considerate for others.
13723,The science of every other negative impact lockdowns have had.
13724,Our freaking children don't even go to school.
13725,"Less than 0.25% of people have died, yet at least 70 million children had their education disrupted for over a year."
13726,"You laugh, but this not funny."
13727,"If you have lived through this, the science of reality and life say the lockdowns have been worse."
13728,What about my own personal experience?
13729,The way you responded makes it seem like a person can't just feel lile the lockdowns are worse.
13730,But we can.
13731,"If we all feel like we suffer worse, then we suffer worse."
13732,It isn't measured by how much money they threw around.
13733,Poor people suffered in ways none of you can understand and callously don't give a fuck about.
13734,The lockdowns are unquestionably worse than COVID.
13735,"And even if you disagree, do you think you have the right to fundamentally change my life?"
13736,You don't.
13737,The lockdowns are the worse things to happen to humanity in the last 100 years.
13738,"It has been worse than war, and its self inflicted."
13739,They need to end now.
13740,Was the J&amp;J vaccine getting the AZ treatment part of the plan?
13741,No backlog
13742,"There is an old saying in medicine, ""If It Has Zero Side Effects, It Probably Doesn’t Work""."
13743,"The equivalent of the US donating 51,5 million doses, assuming this means 800k single doses, even more otherwise"
13744,They really are!
13745,And it's awesome and I hope they keep up with it.
13746,"You can't ignore the fact that there are far too many people who are actively behaving in ways that are fucking things up, though."
13747,"It's happening in Canada, and I see it happening in far too many countries."
13748,"Now is not the time to stop trying, yes?"
13749,"To be fair, the only reason driving by mile is so warped is because of the adage ""You are most likely to get into an accident 10 miles from your home."""
13750,"Duh, that is where I do most of my driving."
13751,[removed]
13752,One of the major talking points about the vaccines is that they reduce the severity of cases on top of reducing the likelihood of infection.
13753,"Not suggesting that it isn't true, it's entirely possible that there are many more asymptomatic/non-tested cases which would lower the fatality rate."
13754,"Then again, that would suggest that the overall efficacy is lower in reducing cases, and possibly suggest that transmission is still probable for many vaccinated people."
13755,"Too early to draw conclusions, but also too early to say something is or is not worrying."
13756,"In terms of safety and efficacy, that does seem true."
13757,Honestly I've been saying the same.
13758,The ingredients in both the mRNA shots are some of the safest we've ever used.
13759,"No preservatives, no metals, food grade lipids, salts, sugar and the mRNA instruction."
13760,"When I heard they only had a few simple ingredients, just funny sounding chemical names that lamens may not understand I was super excited to get either mRNA shot."
13761,I got Moderna.
13762,"And this Sunday I will be 100% fully vaccinated, 6 weeks out total from first shot."
13763,And I'd do it again if it meant never getting covid.
13764,Cause f getting covid.
13765,I don't want to take any chances.
13766,I already had a virus in 2019 that destroyed my right ear.
13767,I didn't die or wasn't hospitalized.
13768,So I take super offense to people who say it only has a 1% death rate.
13769,Try living with a 10khz sound wave in your ear 24/7.
13770,It's not fun.
13771,"Oh, I gotcha."
13772,I think the previous comments were saying that time off is mandatory if you're getting the shot.
13773,Not that it was mandatory to get it.
13774,"Maybe I'm confused, who knows?"
13775,"And yeah, I misunderstood the bank B stuff."
13776,That's bullshit.
13777,There aren't some kind of laws preventing that??
13778,?
13779,"Maybe, maybe not."
13780,"From the article:  


&gt;Clinical anecdotes from doctors suggests the variant spreads faster, is more infectious, can infect entire families, but is less virulent and doesn’t cause dramatically more hospitalisations."
13781,"less virulent is actually a good thing, as elsewhere in the article they say a lot of the cases are asymptomatic."
13782,"So if it's a fitness advantage of infectiousness plus a diminution of severity, that \*could\* translate to a good thing."
13783,"But, as the article says all over the place, there isn't enough data to know one way or the other, on any of it's many claims(higher transmissibility, reason for the surge, less virulence, higher hospitalizations, etc)."
13784,My MIL and FIL have now had both jabs.
13785,"That was 4 round trips of 70 kms and big queues, since we couldn't get an appointment for them together."
13786,My wife accompanied them.
13787,"On one occasion they turned up before, instead of after lunch, and were thus 3 hours short of the wait period between injections."
13788,This meant the supervisor had to be called and consulted and give special permission for things to proceed.
13789,Wasting an hour - on top of filling out forms 8 times.
13790,"My FIL, 92, was quite upset at the sight of many frail and older people struggling physically to get through this."
13791,I'm not surprised that many couldn't make it.
13792,The cdc was very clear about the lack of this kind of event in moderna and Pfizer.
13793,They were quick to finger J and J.
13794,US has been giving out the mrnas by the hundreds of million.
13795,I am sure that this will turn out to be true.
13796,Just like the other preprint saying Pfizer want effective against SA variant.
13797,"Also all the alarmist ""studies"" over the British variant being more lethal etc"
13798,The UK variant is already confirmed to not effect vaccine effectiveness so that one probably won’t be an issue.
13799,The SA variant and the Brazil variant could be though and I personally don’t see Biden lifting travel restrictions to those countries anytime soon.
13800,Can you link or provide additional context i can search for?
13801,"0.03% of all kids is, like, 20,000 kids?"
13802,That's your line?
13803,Ok.
13804,So you don't have a plan.
13805,"Vaccines in perpetuity for diseases is exactly what we do for, you know, everything else."
13806,We already have multiple vaccines that don't require those cold temperatures (J&amp;J and AZ) and the others are in testing for more normal temperatures.
13807,"In countries that can't afford it, they'll let it rip just like they have been for a year now."
13808,"Quarantine for the countries who ""can"" doesn't even make sense - how long are they quarantining?"
13809,Forever?
13810,Otherwise they can quarantine for the next 5 years and *still* be facing variants at that point.
13811,Get some help for your hysteria.
13812,The real issue here is people don't understand statistics.
13813,"Take the worst case scenario, it's like a 1 in 6 million chance you die from the covid vaccine."
13814,There's also around a 1 in 100 million chance you die per mile driven.
13815,This means the covid vaccine has about the same chance of killing you as driving 15 miles.
13816,"Exactly, people used to use this skittle analogy as to why we should do lockdowns to save the at risk group when the death rate is around 1%:

""If you were given 100 skittles but one of them were poisonous, would you still eat the skittles?"""
13817,This same analogy works for the blood clot risk in the vaccines.
13818,"Yet, for some reason those same people who used it for lockdowns will instead call you crazy if you say you'd rather not have the AZ vaccine and say things like the OP article."
13819,I don't get it.
13820,Just let me choose what I put into my body.
13821,We develop nearly all medical technology and the number of life saving MRI machines we have available in the US far outweighs that of Canada by 4x.
13822,Care to explain that one?
13823,"""Tinted supplements""

Lmao I wish my protein shake had free PEDs"
13824,"30yo itaian, hopefully we get the first shot before christmas"
13825,Somebody got Bells Palsy after taking the Pfizer vaccine.
13826,No vaccine is guaranteed to be perfectly safe.
13827,Especially ones that will be taken by over a billion people.
13828,We will be aware of every rare side effect.
13829,"People don't want you to die because of a vaccine, people want you to understand the risk."
13830,Spreading vaccine hesitancy over a 1 in a million chance side effect is crazy and dangerous.
13831,"if the 1 in a million chance is too high for you to justify getting a vaccine, fine, don't."
13832,But to spread around the internet that the vaccine is dangerous because of a 1 in a million complication invites criticism from people who work with risk and understand numbers like those.

13834,I didn’t say it’s a form of oppression?!
13835,"Why would we need masks and testing at say, a high school, where 95-100% of students and staff will be vaccinated?!"
13836,"If the risk is too large we should ban soda, alcohol, driving, and sort of fun, and stay home, masked and socially distant of course, indefinitely."
13837,Walmart in Hodgkins had this whole week wide open when I checked on Sunday afternoon.
13838,"I was frankly shocked but signed up for tomorrow morning, a.k.a."
13839,the first free time on my work calendar.
13840,It's only a few miles away.
13841,I'm strangely excited.
13842,I think masks won't be mandated by July @ Disney.
13843,Same for Universal.

13848,*R. Kelly has entered the chat*
13849,"The manufacturing and logistics, you can thank Pfizer for that."
13850,thats like going out to buy an extinguisher while the house is already half burning
13851,I want to point out that “re-open” isn’t a binary statement.
13852,I’m not saying that Fauci et.
13853,"al., should be recommending a full 100% return to normal, but a slow opening that is consistent with vaccination rates in the community."
13854,"The messaging coming from Fauci is, “fully vaccinated?"
13855,Continue to stay home and do nothing!
13856,It’s still not safe to go to a restaurant.
13857,You can *maybe* see another couple in the back yard”.
13858,"Excuse me, what?"
13859,I’m not suggesting that we let a restaurant open with 100% maskless capacity and let 100 unvaccinated 20 year olds spill drinks all over each other.
13860,I’m saying we should slowly start to open.
13861,"Again, it isn’t an all or nothing solution."
13862,that's probably part of it but I don't get why my back still hurts when I breathe then.
13863,Used to live in Danville.
13864,Bout as backwards as a place as you can get and I was raised in southwestern Virginia 🤣
13865,Does this mean that some people didn’t get antibodies at all?
13866,"(7% for Pfizer and 13% for AZ) 

Good news for AZ T cell response though!"
13867,Hopefully the Pfizer number went up after the 2nd shot.
13868,You probably don't watch football then
13869,"Not really, look at France where most people would not take AZ nowadays."
13870,"Well to clarify, just in case you're under the ***false*** impression pushed by skeptics that the virus is merely the flu or just slightly worse than the flu, the sub has not been saying for the past 13 months that ignoring Fauci and not following his recommendations is good for states."
13871,"Quite the opposite, in fact."
13872,"The sub for the last 13 months has said to follow the data and to take the virus seriously, mask up, social distance and only go out when you need to."
13873,Only recently had that changed slightly to account for vaccine distribution that has ramped up thanks to good national leadership.
13874,"Still, opening when state data doesn't support a complete absence of mitigation efforts is a minority view."
13875,"Now there was a point in time where the sub was being brigaded by those trying to undermine the virus mitigation efforts, but that was short lived."
13876,Just want to point out those areas where you appear confused.
13877,it helped when the logistical requirements were relaxed so that they can been in normal freezers up to 2 weeks.
13878,"Not many states are seeing this wave, Michigan is an extreme outlier right now."
13879,I’m not conservative.
13880,"It’s just what I believe, and it’s clear from the way things played out imo"
13881,Hi!
13882,So it definitely can be scary hearing about all of these things in the news -- I think it's important to note that 1) these more serious side effects are *literally* one in a million and 2) there is no evidence that the mRNA vaccines have similar side effects either.
13883,"The infertility stuff was started by a conspiracy theorist who, simply, has lost touch with reality."
13884,"Here's his explanation: he believes that the spike protein is similar to a placental protein, so therefore, he thinks that the vaccines will cause autoimmune attack of placenta."
13885,That is just wrong on so many levels.
13886,"First, if that was the case, we would see the same phenomenon with actual COVID-19 infection, which we clearly don't."
13887,"Second, the *proteins are not similar at all* -- they have an 11% similarity."
13888,"For context, we say that two proteins are *barely* similar to each other at all when they hit like 20-25% similarity."
13889,"11% is comically low; if the body attacked anything with 11% similarity to something it had an immune response against, the immune system would have wiped us all out long ago."
13890,"It's total nonsense, but unfortunately, this person has been spreading this misinformation, hence the rumors floating around about this."
13891,"Finally, on the topic of long run side effects -- just based on the underlying biology, that really shouldn't be a concern."
13892,I actually did a similar writeup on this point in our FAQ a while ago that I recommend you read: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/wiki/faq#wiki_how_is_it_possible_to_create_a_safe_vaccine_in_such_a_short_period_of_time.3F) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/wiki/faq#wiki_why_are_existing_vaccine_testing_paradigms_useful_for_testing_safety_of_mrna_vaccines.3F).
13893,"I go a lot more in depth there, but just to briefly summarize: the actual vaccine component is going to be destroyed pretty quickly, so if there's any other issues, it's going to be because of the immune response."
13894,"But those sorts of autoimmune conditions will show up very quickly -- like 2-6 weeks at most, and at this point, we can comfortably say that they are not any sort of significant or vaccine-attributable risk."
13895,"Immune responses don't just randomly flare up years later, and even if they did, it's the same immune response you'd have now, so it's not as if something brand new is going to appear months or years after the fact."
13896,Hope that helps!
13897,Except for Dr. Shah.
13898,That guy's cool.
13899,[deleted]
13900,My only objection from a layperson's standpoint is that without an explanation I would have no idea what pp stands for.
13901,% even if it is slightly less acurate is much easier to easily understand especially if it expresses essentially the same thing.
13902,What did he say?
13903,"Yes, but your missing my point."
13904,"They will need access to customers who are not from the EU *nor* the US, to access those customers production will need to be based outside of these places, this will come at the expense of EU vaccine manufacturing because the EU relies of ingredients and materials externally."
13905,"If the EU had export bans from the start, either they will be sidelined by pharmaceutical companies (unlikely) or manufacturer's will set up within the EU with the intention of producing for the EU only and not countries outside the EU, which is what they are doing now."
13906,The vaccines they produce for export within the EU would need to be made elsewhere.
13907,A lot of women are also on hormone replacement therapy for early menopause.
13908,"It’s controversial, because there is also a cancer risk, but it’s also protective of women’s brains and bones to be on HRT."
13909,"Women have to make risky health decisions like this all the time because the medical establishment has not, historically, prioritized the health of women (and women of color even less so)."
13910,"For instance, the US has very high rates of infant and mother mortality during childbirth for a developed nation."
13911,"For instance, our access to abortion is heavily restricted in some areas of this country, either by law or availability."
13912,The Mirena IUD and progestin-only pills (ie mini pills) don’t significantly increase your risk for blood clots either.
13913,And how would AZ have performed under the same conditions?
13914,This is my point so far most of the numbers we are getting aren't really comparable because there are so many confounding factors.
13915,In a situation where we do get both AZ and Pfizer data under the same conditions in the UK we don't find much difference.
13916,Sounds like a panic attack
13917,yeah dude but you probably already thought and reasoned more about it in this few sentences than most antivaxxers have since the whole pandemic started
13918,Same for me in Virginia.
13919,"At 31, even though covid stuck me in the icu for 8 days in November according to our state guidelines I'm not eligible."
13920,They did it anyway because they have more vaccines than arms.
13921,"If you’re not sedentary, though, is around 22 minutes sufficient daily?"
13922,"I work on my feet most of the day and do a lot of heavy lifting, but I only work out at the gym 30 minutes a day 5 days a week."
13923,Cant you get endometrial ablation ?
13924,Or has that gone out of fashion ?
13925,Well they can get credit for enforcing this condition?
13926,"If you’re ever worried, call a dr"
13927,Testing and masks is hygiene theatre?
13928,Jesus crhist you act as if reasonable public health measures are some heinous injustice.
13929,Like how privileged of a life can you have to think this is oppression

13933,*
13934,Oh shit.
13935,I'm so sorry.
13936,I hope you can get better as soon as possible
13937,The whole point is to see if more cases emerge while the pause is on.
13938,"If after a few days it is still just six cases, then they will say ""one in a million carry on."""
13939,[deleted]
13940,Look forward to doing the same once I am 2 weeks beyond my second Moderna shot.
13941,"I will eat out, travel, visit family and workout at the gym like never before!!"
13942,!
13943,"Texas is doing alright now, y’all ;)"
13944,&gt; The way people are disregarding this danger and implying people should potentially let themselves die for the greater good is really outrageous.
13945,"At the height of the pandemic we had a lot of people in the UK saying we should go back to the office/public/businesses to save the economy, while there was no vaccine."
13946,"So this is like, not even peak ""give you life to help out vs the pandemic"""
13947,"I don’t think we’ll ever get to 85%, there’s too many skeptical people out there."
13948,Hopefully eventually they take into account previously recovered cases.
13949,69% would be nice though.
13950,No one is looking for an excuse for a lockdown.
13951,An advisor is just stating a fact that if a new variant spreads that evades the vaccine enough to significantly reduce efficacy against severe illness we'll have to reimpose restrictions.
13952,"It's unlikely, but it's a possibility, so it must be on the table as an option."
13953,Indeed
13954,"I'm not sure where you're getting your numbers from, but ~0.15% of the USA population has already died from covid-19."
13955,"Given that 1/4 to 1/3 of the population has likely been infected, we can guess actual chances of dying are closer to 0.5%."
13956,That's roughly 3 orders of magnitude greater than the 0.0003% chance you indicated.
13957,"Schools are gonna do this until kids are vaccinated probably (maybe im wrong idk), but do not (as it sounds like you are) take this as an indication of society at large."
13958,Everything else will likely completely be open without masks by that point except for schools and airports
13959,"J&amp;J is fucked, already seen as the most inferior vaccine, and now on hold for 1 death out of 7 million people, fucking great job FDA CDC and ACIP."
13960,I hope your pillows are never cold again.
13961,[removed]
13962,Heck Yeah!
13963,Finally got my first shot of moderna!
13964,"This is purely a political decision, but the signal to the world is a dangerous one."
13965,"Dr. Supriya Sharma from Canada just today spoke about how people are generally bad at evaluating risks and that this potential risk is so astronomically low, that it would be irrational/illogical to not take any of these vaccines because we believe it risky (all the while chewing on pills that are way riskier)."
13966,"Sure but if you know you are genetically predisposed to blot clots, do you still think it’s worth the risk?"
13967,"Mexico didn't ""straight up lied"" it's just that a lot of deaths go unreported"
13968,Europe have contracts for far more doses than it has received so far.
13969,"It could stop every export, pay for the doses and still be well within its contracts with the manufacturers."
13970,And every manufacturer would rather take the money and deliver the doses to Europe than have them sit in warehouses.
13971,"Stealing would be if Europe seized shipments of vaccines it haven’t contracted for, and then also didn’t pay for them."
13972,"To offset your experience, everyone I know has been fully vaxxed or at least 1 shot."
13973,Wow
13974,It is NOT free.
13975,It is either covered by your insurance or the government is covering the cost with more borrowed money.
13976,You may not have to pay for it at time of service but I can assure you the vaccine maker/distributor/administrator is getting money for their product and/or services.
13977,I am not saying we should be doing it any other way but free is not a word I would use to describe the vaccine.
13978,I would not blame private company for this unless Indian government had a deal with them to supply vaccines at a rate &amp; they are not fulfilling that promise
13979,So?
13980,He’ll come back 3 months later.
13981,You are a ware that the second shot of AZ has to be given 12 weeks after?
13982,Strange stories you are telling here.
13983,"Canada's issue isn't quantity of doses, it's logistics."
13984,"We're pretty close to dipping below a 75% utilization rate nationwide, and that's largely due to Ontario dropping the ball on sending doses to vaccination sites."
13985,"Something like 10,000+ appointments canceled in the next week, but we've got 1.5 million doses sitting in freezers in Ontario &amp; Alberta waiting."
13986,"Meeting again in 7-10 days to re-review...

Yeah guys no rush here at all!"
13987,Heaven forbid you order some pizzas and stay late for a day or two 🤦‍♂️
13988,"I haven't been keeping up with the vaccination in Europe, is there a reason it's mainly J&amp;J/AZ that is always talked about?"
13989,Why not Moderna or Pfizer?
13990,The US is at the point that literally anyone can make an appointment and get the vaccine and yet Europe is still struggling to get theirs going properly.
13991,[removed]
13992,"I did some digging around and found this study

https://redcap.healthinstitute.illinois.edu/surveys/index.php?s=LL8TKKC8DP"
13993,"I'm vaccinated, and honestly, I like wearing my mask."
13994,"It doesn't bother me at all and I'll continue to wear it as work for as long as they'll let me, since I work in a very germy place where we all get sick every winter *and* my department works with kids."
13995,"With vaccination rates going up, I don't really care one way or the other if other vaccinated people wear theirs, but mine makes me feel safer."
13996,"Plus, I had the J&amp;J so my understanding is that I'm more likely to catch a mild case than people with the two-shot vaccines are."
13997,My guess is that they don't want the PR nightmare that AZ has gone through and instead to skip straight to the end where the vaccine is used only for particular groups.
13998,Do you mean fully vaccinated?
13999,Because as of now 21.023% have received atleast first dosage and thats what I meant.
14000,https://covid19tracker.ca/vaccinationtracker.html
14001,Not in the UK which is where the article is talking about
14002,Why would you do it if you don't recommend it?
14003,"I am also pessimistic about increasing vaccination numbers, which is why I think that it would be wise to temporarily stop booking middle seats."
14004,I believe this.
14005,I’ve been helping the Latino community get their vaccines and my parents friends asked me how much it was gonna cost after I set up an appointment.
14006,I explained it was free and he was shocked.
14007,&gt;  Particularly when said phase 3 trials are conducted in different ways and shouldn't necessarily have their figures directly compared as many people do.
14008,"For citations see this: [https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment\_data/file/971017/SP\_PH\_\_VE\_report\_20210317\_CC\_JLB.pdf](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/971017/SP_PH__VE_report_20210317_CC_JLB.pdf)

Real world UK data where Pfizer and AZ are compared under the same conditions and you'll see they are both very similar."
14009,yea typo sorry
14010,Well yeah.
14011,Its tricking your body into thinking you're pregnant.
14012,What can you expect?
14013,Is that really true?
14014,Any source on that?
14015,"Illinois didn't ""move to reopen"" - early March was when the *metrics* for reopening were announced."
14016,"Numbers have increased since then, so they haven't moved to the next phase, but it wasn't because restrictions changed."
14017,[removed]
14018,Yes and this is probably innate immune system.
14019,&gt; The chance with either the AZ or the J &amp; J vaccine.
14020,Verbs are good.
14021,Anecdotal evidence is weird like that
14022,I could see that arguement but there are other versions of the vaccine to take.
14023,"I had the opportunity to take the the J&amp;J vaccine a month or so ago, but just decided to wait until Moderna or Pfizer was available."
14024,We are still locking down to some extent here in SW Illinois and I have the ability to wait it out for the one I am more comfortable with.
14025,Correct.
14026,That's what Brostrøm said.
14027,"Dont quite understand how it would only save one person from hospitalization, though."
14028,"Beware the fatally experimental, DNA altering gene therapy."
14029,Mwahahahaha!!!
14030,!
14031,"California is already vaccinating 16+, 16-18 can only get Pfizer."
14032,"Yes, a young and healthy life is absolutely more worth saving than an old and sick one."
14033,"When hospitals in Italy were full and there were no more respirators, they prioritized the young and healthy too."
14034,We absolutely should not sacrifice the young and healthy to save the sick and old.
14035,"Of course it doesn't sound nice, but comparing this to nazism is unbelievably wrong."
14036,That’s true but with the speed people are still moving around the planet and the billions of hosts this virus has to infect we are going to be in for a very bumpy ride .
14037,"Well, now we're actually not making jokes anymore, which is sad."
14038,But I think even in Wuhan almost nobody heard of the then-unnamed disease until January 2020.
14039,"I refuted an unfounded claim with a link to some evidence, and when that didn’t seem to sink in, hoped that CorgiOrBread would understand an anecdote better."
14040,There'll surely be a film about this some 5 to 10 years down the line when the covid fatique is gone.
14041,I don’t even know what you’re talking about with your last point.
14042,By this sub I meant this sub.
14043,"By articles in this sub, I’m referencing Canadian epidemiologists Isaac Bogoch and Raywat Deonandan who said in a CBC interview in August 2020 that vaccine rollout would mean a slow return to normal as we rolled out the vaccine age down."
14044,"So unless you’re referring to those two as “lockdown skeptics”, I really don’t get the point you’re making."
14045,Good.
14046,Let's keep em in America until the American population reaches herd immunity
14047,Do they not watch things?
14048,It will be soon.
14049,"Yes, exactly, maybe I should have said, we all live or die with our choices."
14050,I was thinking it.
14051,if it didn't so long to fly out to the Maldives i'd definitely would take a surf trek over there once i get my 2nd shot!
14052,"Just because they would rather let their people die than ask Russia for a vaccine doesn’t make them entirely correct, just correct in that narrow sense."
14053,"""6 people out of 10 million vaccinated have blood clots, pull the vaccine""

6 people out of any group of 10 million people probably have blood clots anyway."
14054,You pull me a group of 10 million people and statistically at least 6 of them will be mauled by a bull or hit by lightning.
14055,It's just a ridiculously meaningless statistic.
14056,"Also that's still way less risk than the 550k Americans that are dead from covid or 12,000 per 10 million of our entire population."
14057,Only just slightly higher than 6.
14058,"Tylenol kills 458 people a year, also very close to 6, no one is pulling it from the shelves."
14059,Just no.
14060,"Comin' again to save the muthafuckin' day, yeah!"
14061,"Couldn't we just export J&amp;J now, if we are not going to use them?"
14062,Yeah that's what I thought.
14063,"I feel as the number of vaccinated people go up, the closer and closer the population of post-vaccinated severely infected people will match the percentage of the efficacy rate."
14064,In the US the easiest way is to check which vaccine givers have which vaccine.
14065,I got mine at Rite aid which has moderna.
14066,"You are aware that quite a few vaccines require boosters, right??"
14067,?
14068,Ahh that sucks.
14069,I always follow these random things people say to see where they end up
14070,It's not recommended.
14071,"A shorter interval will likely result in lower efficacy than a longer interval, the shortest gap in the Pfizer trial was 18 days, the current recommendation is 21-42 days as per [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/clinical-considerations.html](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/clinical-considerations.html), some nations have gone to 120 days."
14072,This is incorrect.
14073,Think of the Phase 3 trials.
14074,It's assumed the risk (over a large) sample is the same between groups.
14075,"You don't force people to be exposed to the virus, or only count people who think they have been."
14076,Our education system has failed huge swaths of our society.
14077,"We can wring our hands and debate what to do about these swaths, or just let them be (and suffer as the results of their mis-informed actions) and try to do better with the future generations."
14078,I think the Olympic Committee told them it simply wont' happen if it's postponed beyond this year.
14079,I'm guessing next year already being a Winter Olympics year played a role.

14120,"You are describing [disease eradication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eradication_of_infectious_diseases), not herd immunity."
14121,"The intent of all or even most vaccines is not to eradicate a disease entirely, that is a task so enormous that a vaccine is only one tool in the process."
14122,[This article explains](https://www.pfizer.com/news/hot-topics/what_is_herd_immunity_and_how_does_it_work) how herd immunity works.
14123,"By definition, it does not itself eradicate a virus."
14124,It only dramatically slows the spread.
14125,&gt;Herd immunity occurs when the majority of a population is immune to a disease or virus.
14126,"Otherwise known as community immunity, it *helps to slow the spread of infectious diseases* in two ways

Achieving herd immunity and eradicating a virus are monumentally different tasks."
14127,"Humanity has only eradicated two infectious diseases in its history, smallpox, and rinderpest (a cattle disease)."

14131,"Per the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/vaers/index.html), the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is used to collect reports of adverse events after vaccination from the general public."
14132,This is primarily used to identify potential topics to further investigate with regards to vaccine reactions.
14133,"However, because the event data in VAERS is often not verified and is often self-reported, it should not be assumed that the adverse events in VAERS are actually associated with or cause by the vaccines, nor is it possible to estimate the frequency of these adverse events from these data."

14137,"According to the CDC presentation given yesterday regarding the J&amp;J vaccine, the 6 reported clotting cases were among **1,402,712 doses** administered to the affected demographic (women aged 20-50)."
14138,"So, for this demographic, the risk is actually a lot higher than one in a million."
14139,"According to the data, risk of clotting is *3 times greater* than what we would see in the general population (for this age/gender group)."
14140,"You can view the full CDC presentation slides here (From April 14th): [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/slides-2021-04.html](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/slides-2021-04.html)

Also, the 6 cases are only the ones that have been *officially* reported in VAERS."
14141,There are likely many others that have not been reported.
14142,"In my view, it is hard to know for certain what the risk-to-benefit ratio is, especially for young and healthy people."
14143,"As the clinical trials continue, we will have a better idea of the risks vs. benefits a few years from now, when we will be able to see population-wide effects more clearly."

14145,It's a solid argument.

14147,"So, if you don't need to rush it, you don't need to risk it either."
14148,"If you're vaccinating, and saying in a strict lockdown, I wouldn't risk it."
14149,"In the US you have a choice, my county portal let me search by specific brand so if I wanted Pfizer over Moderna or vice versa I could find the places giving those shots."

14159,that's putting the cart before the horse.
14160,It's not like any groundwork has to be laid for something as simple as a mask mandate.
14161,It takes less effort to mask up than to move your car to the other side of the road on street cleaning day.

14208,The problem with your argument is that coronavirus is not going away.
14209,"We are still looking at (at least) 20% of the population not having antibodies due to passing on the vaccine, being the unlucky 5%ish that don't develop antibodies from the vaccine, or those that antibodies fade after infection."
14210,"So ""waiting it out"" is is not really a factor here."
14211,"We will all be exposed eventually given enough time, and for places like Britain, astrazeneca is the only vaccine available."
14212,You're proof that FOXNEWS is also an information tragedy of the commons.
14213,Just got my 2nd Pfizer dose.
14214,"The thing I’m most glad about is not even that I can go back to normal or not wear a mask, but rather than I don’t have to worry every time I feel off physically."
14215,My anxiety has been worse than ever the last year and it’s gonna take some time to get over it.
14216,First step for me is not seeking out coronavirus news.
14217,If something is important enough I will find out somehow.
14218,It’s ironic that the only time I will be sick the last year will be due to getting a vaccine lol.
14219,74 deaths of most likely old peeps.
14220,Specifically because of the selfishness of the US.
14221,0 vaccine exports like what the fuck.
14222,"And if it's June 15th, only 10% of people have a shot, and appointments have been open for weeks with nobody interested... then still open up; they've volunteered to take the risk!"
14223,Oh that’s good.
14224,I thought that having no reaction meant that your body wasn’t building strong immunity.
14225,"Yeah, having 8 people get ill or drop dead in your state from the J&amp;J dab does that."
14226,I meant the understanding of the phrase.
14227,People associate it as you just described.
14228,I used the adage as another example of misunderstanding a phrase.
14229,"Well, vaccination is a choice, and people have to live with the choices they make."
14230,I'm vaccinated and everyone I know is vaccinated.
14231,"It's too early, and I have a lot of sympathy for people like myself who followed the rules and were until recently in a small (like 20% of the population) group who could not get the vaccine."
14232,I already felt pretty singled out when they went from being open to like 20% of the population to 80% of the population being eligible.
14233,"If they then remove mask mandates to put those same people at more risk before they even had a chance to do anything about it, it's quite shitty."
14234,"I was lucky in that I could volunteer at a clinic to get mine, but a lot of people don't have that opportunity."
14235,I'm all for ending mask mandates.
14236,But do it 6-8 weeks after the vaccine is available to the general public to give everyone a chance.
14237,"This is the end result of decades of teaching kids that if science doesn't match your belief system you can just substitute ""alternative science"""
14238,It doesn't.
14239,Not randomized.
14240,Different populations.
14241,Different dosing regimen than recommended.
14242,"It may tell you something, but it doesn't tell you much."
14243,The comment you replied to is collecting all possible outcomes.
14244,Assuming it's a useful start to later try and determine the likelihood of each and visualise actual combined risks.
14245,"Appeals for compassion are good, but not relevant here."
14246,I’m in a pretty mask heavy state NJ and rarely see people wearing masks outdoors anymore.
14247,I never bothered unless somehow I was going to be in a super clustered outdoor space.
14248,3 most for usa and eu the rest of the world will have to wait way more
14249,I fought for a year and a1/2 to get my insurance company to guarantee that a federally mandated procedure thats supposed to be covered at 100% wasn't going to cost me $2500-$3500 They wouldn't do it.
14250,MY Employers benefits department didn't help either.
14251,"As an add on bonus our mandated 100% covered yearly physical was always $150-$200

Is it any wonder that people don't trust their employers or their insurance companies?"
14252,That wasn't a randomized study and populations were different.
14253,"AZ may have some advantage, but the point is moot since you are comparing single doses for some pointless reason."
14254,These are both great vaccines and world wide the AZ vaccine may be far more important.
14255,"From what I understand, younger healthier people have more severe side effects on average as their immune system responds faster and more strongly."
14256,That's why you get the fever-like side effects.
14257,If my children’s grandparent refused to get vaccinated they wouldn’t see the child in person.
14258,"Others may feel differently, but I’m not risking my children’s health just because a grandparent is antivax and it sounds like in your case not taking precautions seriously."
14259,Pausing the vaccination means in my State that the vans rolling out to elderly homebound who are at very high risk have stopped.
14260,J&amp;J was the preferred vaccine for them specifically because it was one and done.
14261,Same thing for the homeless.
14262,This pause will cost more lives than continuing the J&amp;J injections.
14263,At the very least they could have paused it for women under 60 instead of blanket everyone.
14264,Second Moderna shot for me next Thursday
14265,"By this time next year, Mexico will be building a wall to us both out."
14266,The hardcore antivaxxers will.
14267,This will still help with some of the vaccine hesitant who aren't that far gone.
14268,Thanks!
14269,"I’ve seen that paper you posted before,  but I’ve since seen a few other (though not many, as I said) more recent things that suggest that moderna does indeed elicit cd8+."
14270,This is one example: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.27.433180v1.
14271,"It studies the response of cd8+ (and cd4+) t-cells elicited by both Pfizer and moderna, which means that there were moderna-elicited ones to study."
14272,I’ve also been told that t-cells are often tough to measure which could help explain why early on Pfizer found them but moderna didn’t...they maybe weren’t looking as hard or were using a less-than-ideal test or some of both.
14273,"I know this response makes it sound like I already knew the answer or was fishing for one that agrees with what I already think, and that may be true to some degree, but I’m more looking for additional info on this and to “confirm” these notions."
14274,"Like I said, there seems to be little info on this stuff in general and the guy who was mentioning that Pfizer had a better t-cell response than moderna seemed to know what he was talking about, but then I couldn’t get a concrete response on what he was looking at for the moderna info, so maybe not."
14275,"Long story short, I sure wish somebody had more concrete info on any of it!"
14276,They are smart
14277,"&gt;It's just that rural areas have a larger share of people in the most vaccine-resistant groups: Republicans and White Evangelical Christians,"" says Drew Altman , president and CEO of the Kaiser Family Foundation."
14278,"On a recent weekend in Hartsville, the local health department had trouble filling up even half the spots for a COVID vaccination event at the high school."
14279,Public health officials in Tennessee and other southern states have been far more focused on building trust with Black and immigrant groups concentrated in urban areas.
14280,I think there will be a subset of the population who will be.
14281,There was already a narrative among certain people that the vaccines hadn't had time to be tested properly.
14282,The hysteria over the this and the J&amp;J Vaccine is going to vindicate their hesitancy in their eyes.
14283,"As with most things to do with public opinion its not about true believers changing their mind, its the people already on the fence who are pushed over onto the other side."
14284,My 90something grandparents all had their shots given by an ambulance service in their homes.
14285,Bonkers to make the frail elderly go through that.
14286,Government bureaucracies are actually quite large.
14287,The largest employer in almost every state.
14288,Are you talking about vaccinating literally the 170 or so heads of state?
14289,That depends on the situation.
14290,If there is high demand they should definitely wait for signaling purposes.
14291,"Can we at least wait until six weeks after vaccines hit ""general availability"" before dropping mask mandates?"
14292,For those who are still on the front lines but weren't in the earlier groups it'd be nice if they could still have the limited protection of the masks until they had the full protection of the two dose vaccines.
14293,"It's not like wearing the masks hurts the economy, it's just a face covering, most businesses are open as usual."
14294,"Nope, not bad at all!"
14295,"In the trials, there were a wide range of reactions to the vaccine, and groups that had no reaction still had the same level of protection."
14296,You're just one of the lucky ones!
14297,Congrats on being vaccinated!
14298,"I have yet to find J&amp;J available anywhere in my state prior to the pause even if I wanted it which I didnt, finding Moderna and Pfizer is much easier even though appointments most likely will be a few days out"
14299,Wenn ihr tanzet will ich fuhren
14300,Why 6 weeks?
14301,I thought the second Moderna vaccine was 4 weeks after the first.
14302,Edit: Unless what you mean is it takes 2 weeks for full effect?

14323,"But thats the point, you don't take it all at once, the point is to do it over time to build up immunity as your body learns to handle it."

14344,"The fact that masks went away doesn’t mean that it’s working if you look at the #s

There have been places the entire last year where they weren’t required, I know that there’s plenty of people like you and even in this sub apparently but they’re not going away because there is a huge overlap of anti-maskers who are anti-vaxxers &amp; will cause the need to continue to wear masks in planes, public transport, and shared spaces like stores and stadiums."

14369,"Lmao, this is how you're selling this hot diarrhea now?"
14370,This is yesterday’s release.
14371,The 194.8M number was reported yesterday.
14372,198.3 was reported today.
14373,"Generally, when these threads are posted, they're talking about the previous day's numbers."
14374,"The way I live nowadays, my chances of catching covid are as close to zero as they could be."
14375,"I’m also relatively young, so the probability of developing severe disease, getting a blood clot, for me is really not high."
14376,"For someone like me, the AZ shot is probably not worth the risk."
14377,Though for a 70 year old man with constant exposure to the virus it may very well be.
14378,"His philosophy was, “you don’t have coronavirus unless I tell you you have coronavirus.” The guy doesn’t give a shit about other people."
14379,All he cares about is maintaining his metrics.
14380,This is ridiculous.
14381,Flagrantly ignoring a lethal side effect that you know to exist is how you get people to never get a vaccine ever again.
14382,And exposure to both armrests is up 50%.
14383,24 hours
14384,"we could always do better, but if that's the number it's not a bad one"
14385,Late 20s actually.

14387,No clue to her genetics though
14388,Israel is one of the most population dense countries in the world
14389,Judging from the rest of their Co ID response here in Germany where they went axactly against the advice from experts in the field I'd personally decided to simply ignore them on this matter.
14390,"Talked to three doctors, all advised me to take the Astra vaccine as a 30 something male."
14391,Social media is a disease to human kind.
14392,"Considering that a lot of people died from it, it could be one of the side effects that are not really looked into."
14393,"After all, failing lungs due to clots and brain clots could happens at the same time."

14413,It's not Facebook fault that morons use it as their only news source and it consumes the majority of their social life.
14414,People never really needed to wear masks outdoors.
14415,Follow the science and outdoor spread is slim to nil.
14416,About 1.9M so not really a small amount idk why he'd say it's a pretty small amount
14417,"Plus some countries already pledged to donate actual vaccines as well, just not yet and not necessarily through Covax."
14418,"Portugal, for example, promised back in February they'd donate the final 5% of its 2021 EU vaccine allotment to poor countries of the CPLP (the community of Portuguese speaking countries)."
14419,"that's the problem, we dont really know what's going to happen at a slower vaccine pace, Israel vaccinated so quickly that we don't really know what happens at each % vaccinated as we will learn with the US, and the UK."
14420,The CDC is the source cited by most of those article.
14421,"They revised their guidelines, and said that the odds of picking up covid from an infected surface are 1 in 10000."
14422,I thought the protection was only for 6 months?
14423,I would love to see this vaccine research lead to a universal flu vaccine at some point
14424,"From reading what they briefly touched on in the article, it sounds like it is for use early on after symptom onset, and rapidly reduces viral loads in the upper airwaye before it can spread to the lungs to cause the more severe symptoms."
14425,Basically it reduces covid to being like a common cold.
14426,I’m pretty sure COVID has fucked my brain harder than any vaccine ever could so please get vaccinated
14427,"it's not ""outdoor"" transmission per se, but masking when you're gathering with strangers."
14428,"Most ppl are out &amp; about visiting friends, neighbors, hanging out a lot more given our Work From Home schedules."
14429,It's this extended close contact interactions (even outdoors) which can promote spread.
14430,Of course if you're just out jogging or yoga or something with your family or roomies it's fine to be unmasked.
14431,"But let's face it, ppl don't go to the dog park for their pet's benefit."

14442,At least we know you will be fine.
14443,"Fuck everyone else through, right?"
14444,You are also being misleading.
14445,"In the J&amp;J clinical trial, two people had CVST: one in the vaccine arm (male) and one in the placebo arm (female)."
14446,"So out of the people who have had CVST &amp; J&amp;J, there have actually been 7 total cases if you include the male in the clinical trial: 6 in the 'real world', 1 in the clinical trial."
14447,"I actually believe they recently found a 7th case (female) in the 'real world', and we are probably going to find a few more since it takes 6-13 days."
14448,"In Europe with AZ, the female to male ratio for CVST cases is around 2 to 1, so if the mechanism is similar for J&amp;J, everyone going around parroting ""well all the cases have been young women, so the risk is only for young women, so you have to calculate the odds for young women only"" is also misleading."
14449,"At this point, we simply do not have enough data to conclude that this is only affecting young women, especially when the data out of Europe with AZ does not support that."
14450,"The fact that all 7 cases in the US in the 'real world' were female can totally just be chalked up to random chance at this point, especially when you consider that the one person who got it in the clinical trial was a male."
14451,"This is old...

14454,"Is the assumption on this that covid is no longer a risk after a certain amount of time thus 1-10 holds true indefinitely, when it could also be an issue we deal with for the next 2-3 years."
14455,While vaccines thus far have proven to be be effective against variants
14456,"What worries me even more is the fact that there is arily a major chunk of people who call this ""political drama""."
14457,Pathetic people.
14458,"economists, psychiatrists, and all kinds of experts should be involved in decision making, unfortunately we've delegated all of it to people in a very narrow field who are in way over their heads."
14459,"An economist would say ""hey, we're almost certain covid stops spread, the tiny risk of spread is worth getting far more people vaccinated by saying they can burn their masks and go party with 100 strangers in a nightclub with the shot."""
14460,From what I've heard anecdotally there are a lot of people in the UK who won't get AZ now and that it's hindered their vax efforts there.
14461,You aren't an antivaxer?
14462,Are you sure?
14463,Because you're obviously missing the point that it's comparing the risk of these specific rare blood clots.
14464,"They're not that common in Covid, but they are still 8 x more common in Covid than from the vaccine."
14465,"You've also decided to forget the other significant risks of Covid, including other types of blood clots, neurological and organ damage, respiratory failure, strokes and heart attacks being just a few and that the vaccination has real world data showing it is preventing hospitalisation and deaths."
14466,We could also compare the number of world wide deaths (millions) from Covid to the number who sadly died from the vaccination.
14467,If you thought about it a bit harder you would see that it's not comparing how likely you are to die from Covid vs the vaccine but in terms of CVST only.
14468,It won't change the minds of anti-vaxxers.
14469,"It might change the mind of people who are generally pro-vax, but just not for a brand new vax for a disease that is not particularly deadly to large swaths of the population."
14470,If you include the risk of getting covid and then dieing and/or blot clots aswell.
14471,Then it's fair to say that the vaccine by far presents the least risk when compared to getting clots from the vaccine.
14472,"Lower cases and positivity than last week, fewer hospitalized today than yesterday, but also a bit fewer shots than last week (our three-in-a-row record days for doses was last week) probably due to not having J&amp;J."
14473,Only 8 times?
14474,How many?
14475,I did not see it broken out yet.
14476,You think the PhD researchers don't know that there's an underlying risk of clots regardless of whether you're vaccinated?
14477,I'm under the impression that the clots seen have been different than those of organic origin and can be traced back to the vaccine
14478,I'm ok with vaccination being the end of it but I disagree about it being pointless.
14479,Other than contracting covid before lockdown last year I wasn't sick at all last year and it's now been over a year since I was sick.
14480,To me this proves that masks work as I normally get sick with whatever crud is being passed around the office or the church or the community in general.
14481,I plan to keep wearing them even though I'm now vaccinated.
14482,If people want to not wear them once vaccination rates go up I don't care.
14483,Is the risk increased if you already have low platelets?
14484,I’m on the fence until someone can answer this.
14485,Did i say im a moron?
14486,I don't remember doing so.
14487,"She's the head of government, but the president is actually head of state."
14488,Conveniently ignoring all the other short and long term effects covid may have.
14489,The Republican party isn’t so monolithic that this would work for everyone (there are still many Republicans who saw Trump as merely the least bad option).
14490,"All that said, this is a fantastic point."
14491,Putting Trump out there to advocate for “his administration’s vaccine” would work for a significant part of the conservative base.
14492,I do hope that Trump gets more involved with vaccine promotion in the coming months.
14493,"At this point, more people vaccinated makes everyone safer, regardless of political affiliation."
14494,"(Note: I use the term “his administration’s vaccine”, not because it is factually true, but because that would be a good way to market the vaccine in certain areas)."
14495,This was always a possibility.
14496,Hopefully it gets to the point where getting a COVID vaccine is as easy as getting a flu shot.
14497,I mean then we're no worse or better off than before but at least we're contributing to science.
14498,This post appears to be about vaccines.

14502,"Couldn’t tell from the article, are the boosters being designed differently to anticipate mutations?"
14503,I think there was a sentiment that for people in the most resistant groups there is very little that can actually be done to get them to take the vaccine.
14504,In the case of African Americans it's much less about resistance if you look at the polling and much more about access and getting people to figure out how to get the vaccine

14533,&gt; Forcing a vaccine that might have more dire consequences than covid is not a good strategy.
14534,It shouldn't be forced but people should be allowed to make an informed decision on the risks and choose to get it anyway.
14535,The overall risk is exceedingly low and depending on the country- the risk of death or debilitating injury from covid can be much higher.
14536,That the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have had zero serious side effects in hundreds of millions of doses is actually incredible- most drugs and vaccines carry some risk- however small.
14537,Does that speculative date count people that have recovered and may have some immunity?

14650,The video he is referring to is a video by Vox.
14651,"Vox is generally not a great source for accurate information; sometimes they are good, but I wish more people took a giant grain of salt with anything they put out."
14652,It's honestly pretty frustrating how relatively little I see this talking point emphasized.
14653,"Maybe it sounds callous, but doesn't every surge we go through only push us closer to herd immunity?"
14654,"Hell, say we top out at fifty percent vaccinated - shouldn't the scores of people already infected easily carry us to the eighty/ninety percent goal we're shooting for?"
14655,Is fifty percent vaccine uptake really a problem?
14656,"These are genuine questions, as I'm just a layman talking out my ass."
14657,At this point I think you have to write off anyone that yells at you as a weirdo.
14658,You weren't even going against the NY mandate in this situation..
14659,True story.
14660,I live in GA and there's a fairly large vaccination center in AL within 50 miles of where I live.
14661,They basically put out the call last month for anybody to show up and get shots ... so I went.
14662,I know lots of others from GA who did also.
14663,So what's scary is that 63% probably is only 63% because tons of people from out of state took advantage of the high vaccine availability there.
14664,"Same thing was happening towards the beginning of the rollout in the US (late January, early February)."
14665,"Geez, they were doing so well, too."
14666,Envy of the world until now.
14667,"Again, great questions!"
14668,"The short answer is: there has been, there have just been issues that have prevented the mRNA from getting into the cell before the immune system degrades it."
14669,STAT News did a great piece on this topic [here](https://www.statnews.com/2020/11/10/the-story-of-mrna-how-a-once-dismissed-idea-became-a-leading-technology-in-the-covid-vaccine-race/).
14670,"Basically, there are a couple problems that had to be solved."
14671,"First, there needed to be a way to prevent the mRNA from getting caught too quickly and degraded rapidly by the immune system before it even has a chance to get into the cells."
14672,This is independent of the RNAses I described above -- I'm talking about an actual immune response here.
14673,"Second, there needed to be a way to efficiently get it into the cells."
14674,"Third, you have to show that combining the previous two steps actually is effective in causing protein production in cells and gets degraded on a reasonable timescale in the cell."
14675,"These developments essentially were published in 2004, 2000, and 2010, respectively -- the biggest problem being the first one, of preventing the immune system from attacking the mRNA itself."
14676,The STAT News piece does a really good job going into the details here in an accessible way.
14677,"So the short answer is: we've known about mRNA for a long time, but actually harnessing it is based on more recent tweaks."
14678,"As for understanding the molecular biology, it really depends how in depth you want to get."
14679,"If you want a good understanding of it at a pretty reasonably accessible level, I'd suggest reading from Albert's Molecular Biology of the Cell on [making RNA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26887/) and [using RNA to make proteins](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26829/), an old edition of which is actually available for free."
14680,"This reading is actually what we assign to first-year undergrads in an introductory molecular biology course that I TA, and it's typically pretty well-received."
14681,"If you want a simpler explanation, I can see if I can scrounge something up, but I highly recommend trying out the Albert's section first."
14682,"(For readability in the above link, I recommend clicking ""Disable Glossary Links,"" but it could also be helpful to you based on your background.)"
14683,Hope that helps!
14684,"Wow, our case/ hospitalization/ death rates are going to begin plummeting really soon."
14685,"They’re theatre when they’re unnecessary, which they absolutely will be when vaccines work infinitely more than them and are widespread."
14686,We need vaccine funding?
14687,Should be postponed another year to be honest.
14688,Next year they could probably hold a more or less normal version of the olympics.
14689,Does the poll break out responses by how respondents viewed the vaccines before?
14690,It's not helpful if all of that 60% were the people already hell-bent on getting vaxxed.
14691,I think the messaging has been pretty clear that the vaccines are the path to normalcy.
14692,Where are people getting the idea that's not the case?
14693,"Data is showing the answer to be “not a whole lot, really.”

Like it or not, things are moving."
14694,It did.
14695,In early March restrictions were eased and bars allowed to stay open later and we saw a huge jump in cases and hospitalizations two weeks later and plans got put on hold.

14703,Lol imagine refusing a vaccine.
14704,"So if you had the option to refuse, how is that forcing AZ."
14705,That literally makes no sense.
14706,Do you get a choice of the brand of all your pharmaceuticals?
14707,Why not leave it to the experts  and grow tf up
14708,"I’m staying out of this argument either way, but I think you misunderstood their point."
14709,"It’s not that they expect smaller countries to have multiple vaccine production facilities, it’s that they fail it’s their own problem that they don’t."

14714,My skin did feel really hot for the entirety of the next day but it didn’t bother me.
14715,I don’t see anything wrong with that so long as you’re continuing with social distance and mitigation efforts.
14716,Birth controll has a 0.1% to 0.01% chance to cause blood clots over a 10 year period not every single time you take a pill
14717,"It absolutely is false, you're just ignoring the realities of the world and claiming that if something can work in theory it can work in real life."
14718,"In real life the countries that went into the ""open economy"" option suffered the most economic pain."
14719,"Governments being incompetent and not adequately locking down, instead bungling it up are just that, incompetent."
14720,"This is mostly because they wanted the best of both worlds and instead got the worst, they didn't truly lockdown properly and you're saying their lack of will means the truth isn't so."
14721,You’re trolling.
14722,What's restricted other than wearing masks?
14723,"You can lay on a beach, swim and dine outside (I think?)"
14724,like what you'd do normally in Hawaii anyways.
14725,Outside 95% of the time enjoying those trade winds and sunshine!
14726,I'd still go if it were me if you're not worried about testing and being forced to quarantine.
14727,"[A quick check-in with U.S. adults reveals that contrary to the prevailing view on Twitter, the decision to pause the J&amp;J vaccine due to a small number of blood clotting issues actually makes Americans more, not less, confident in the COVID-19 vaccines."

14729,"I’m thinking because there’s been so much more attention on the Covid vaccines, we just didn’t hear about it."
14730,"I’ve also seen studies now about people who had a bleeding disorder after getting the Pfizer and Moderna, so it’s not limited to just the adenovirus vaccines."
14731,It’s just an immune response that could happen to any vaccine recipient in rare cases.
14732,"I can't remember exactly what, but something to the effect of athletes are going to want to compete now because many won't be able to compete in the next Olympics 4 years from now."

14961,My guess is yes.
14962,Just like some people have problems with the yearly flu shot.
14963,Still much better than the alternative.
14964,"Typically occurred within days to a few weeks of the first shot, to my knowledge"
14965,"Nope, her age group is Prio3, being the federal chancellor is also Prio3."
14966,Well the good news there is it appears the vaccines significantly reduce transmission as well.
14967,"Once vaccines are readily available to everyone and everyone who wants one has gotten one, any restrictions and mandates that remain will be quickly dropped and everyone will be responsible for their own risk assessment."
14968,Don’t lose too much sleep over people who were offered the same chance you were to protect themselves and refused.
14969,That’s on them.
14970,Pfizer stonks 🚀
14971,Yep.
14972,I've already started stocking up on masks as the prices fall.

14974,"I may switch to a kf80 or possibly multilayered cloth mask for outdoor events, but I'm not letting my guard down - just letting my stress level fall a little."
14975,we'll need the vaccine annually for a few years at least for sure.
14976,I think in most of Western Europe it would be pretty scandalous for a politician to jump the queue.
14977,Here in the UK there’d have been an outcry if Boris Johnson had received an early jab.
14978,I get the logic that senior politicians should be protected but it just wouldn’t be politically acceptable here.
14979,It was only a nightmare because they had to built the logistics side of it from scratch.
14980,"For example, here in California the first couple of weeks were horrible."
14981,Possibly the worst in the country.
14982,Now we are pumping out a huge amount of jabs and are doing the best in the country.
14983,"Long as the supply is there, well be fine and continue to improve."
14984,That's a tough one -- I'd recommend calling your vaccination site and asking.
14985,"Like the other user said, you have plenty of wiggle room on the second dose, so they'll most likely just ask you to reschedule to 14 days after the flu shot."
14986,"Supply side is weak in DC due to being treated as a territory, meanwhile I get my first shot on Tuesday"

15032,"I live in the middle of bum fuck nowhere Maryland, the clinics down here are doing thousands every day for anyone 18 and over"
15033,"The past year has taught me reddit is full of outspoken extremist morons, either that or purposefully deceptive people with agendas."
15034,I think the current absolute numbers aren't particularly important.
15035,The number of daily deaths in Israel is a direct result of the number of deaths at the peak (which was pretty bad) + the reproduction number since then.
15036,"The latter is what really matters, and in Israel it has remained below 1 for over a month, despite close to zero restrictions."
15037,"In the US, the President would be replaced by the VP that same day."

15056,Don't think we are going to have annual shut downs as long as enough people are vaccinated.
15057,We only shut down because we had no answer for the pandemic.
15058,Now we have an answer and things are opening up.
15059,"Worse case we have to get a yearly shot, which the majority of people will do it seems like."
15060,"I don't even want to go anywhere that's not a destination of necessity (eg gas station, supermarket) with a mask."
15061,"Who wants to spend an easygoing night out with friends masked up at the local bar or try out a new restaurant, much less concerts or clubbing."
15062,The thing here is that the German head of state has nothing to do with the government.
15063,The president is more like the queen of England.
15064,"Of course Merkel is de facto the most important person in Germany, but not head of state."
15065,":)

But in Germany the independent federal ethics committee has decided who will be vaccinated when."
15066,"And they have placed top politicians very low, even below homeless people."
15067,That's not how vaccines work broseph.
15068,Waiting a week for more data to come in then re-evaluate.
15069,This should be stickied.

15082,theres 600k covid deaths in the us.. what do you think the ifr is ?
15083,"even if it was as high as 1 percent (its not), that would mean that 60 million people have already had it in the us, being 20 percent of the population."
15084,Ifr is probably more like .5% so 40 percent of the us has already had it.
15085,This is correct in Tennessee also.
15086,"Memphis, Nashville, and i think Knoxville have their own health depts but the rest of the state is under the TN dept of health"
15087,"I’m not saying that restriction-lifting should or shouldn’t be tied to % vaccinated or case numbers, but the fact is that in many places, it is."
15088,Getting vaccinated remains a practical step toward faster restriction-lifting whether you agree that it should be that way or not
15089,Never know when someone might jump out of the bushes at you and then you gasp and cough from the shock of it and a loogie lands right in their mouth
15090,If there are isolated pockets of people who are like that .
15091,.

15093,let them stay isolated.

15098,And no one stopped you from living healthy.
15099,You just weren't able to do it the way you wanted.
15100,You sounded like a k        aren.
15101,"Right, but before the vaccine became widely available, Israel was *ravaged* by infections."
15102,"They are 12th in the world in cases/million, and the only other country that even sniffs their population above them is the USA."
15103,My point is natural immunity is playing a significant role in their herd immunity.
15104,I imagine the US will have similar drops in data at similar thresholds of vaccinated population.
15105,Germany will start combining AZ with the 2nd dose from Biontech for people under 60 who got the AZ shot before it was suspended for that age group.
15106,We will have some real-life data about vaccine combinations soon.
15107,Right?
15108,"LOL, I *hate* talking to people at the dog park."

15113,I see get your vaccine and get vaccine questions answered ads on tv every single day
15114,Media Headline: VACCINES “MORE LIKELY” TO CLOT LIKE A COVID NFECTION
15115,"Hmm, hard to say how many you’ll lose."
15116,"I think a lot of sites are collecting some information from people, so they could follow up with folks."
15117,That should get most of the ones who just forgot.
15118,"If people were less nuts about vaccination, going door to door for those who hadn’t gotten it yet might make sense, but it’s probably too dangerous."
15119,"A few reasons: that’s what was tested, so it’s safer/easier to do that."
15120,"One shot for everyone first, then the second is likely a better strategy, but doing that is sticking your neck, so if you’re wrong you’re liable."
15121,What’s safest politically/career wise isn’t always what’s best.
15122,We’re not sure how long protection from just one shot lasts.
15123,And two shots does seem to be better than one.
15124,"A jump from 90% to 95% is double the protection, since it’s from 1/10 to 1/20."
15125,"Personally the British strategy of going for everyone getting a first shot, and then looping back and doing second shots makes a ton of sense."
15126,"I imagine a lot of other countries will do that, especially as we get data on how long protection from just one shot lasts."
15127,"

&gt;People have become so anti anti-vaccers on this site that they've gone to the opposite extreme and become pro-vaccine zealots that ignore any expert advice or testimony to the contrary."
15128,I fear for many it is more about being superior to anti-vaccers than scientific truth.
15129,1.
15130,The fact a vaccine was discovered to have side effects doesn't mean anti-vaxxers are right or smart.
15131,"It means they're absolute idiots because it proves that ""mainstream science"" (aka science) *does* care about vaccine side effects, *does* inform the public of vaccine risks, *does* adjust policy to protect citizens and not just medical companies, that the ""mainstream media"" *does* report on the objective truth of vaccines, and that rational people *are* listening to the experts."
15132,The fact this is happening actually proves how stupid anti-vaxxers are.
15133,"It basically blows apart their entire ""beliefs"" about dangerous vaccines and conspiracies."
15134,The fact scientists have said for decades that vaccines are safe isn't because there's a secret conspiracy to lie about vaccines - it's because the vaccines *are* actually safe and if/when an issue with a vaccine is discovered it's not kept a secret.
15135,2.
15136,"Pro-vaccine (aka rational) people *are* superior to anti-vaxxers, at least on this topic, because they're making a decision based on science instead of memes and feelings, and that's a superior choice."
15137,Anti-vaxxers aren't super-informed truth-tellers crusading for health and safety... they're just deluded and cringeworthy.
15138,3.
15139,It's anti-vaxxers who don't listen to expert advice or testimony.
15140,"Literally every health organization in the world can recommend something, and anti-vaxxers will ignore it because of their implicit science denial and then see a Facebook video from one lone  Dr Whoeverthefuck saying he feels he ""has to come forward and tell the secret truth"" and then they'll pat themselves on the back for ""listening to the experts""."
15141,"This is called confirmation bias, and everyone with any sense knows that's not how a rational person becomes informed."
15142,"You don't seek out one tiny, very dubious piece of info that confirms what you want to believe in an absolute ocean of scientific data to the contrary."
15143,"You listen to the vast, overwhelming scientific consensus."
15144,The herd immunity threshold depends on population attributes that are likely different from country to country.
15145,In particular it depends on how homogenous the population is in its ability to get infected and infect others.
15146,Israel has a relatively young population which might contribute to a lower threshold.
15147,Can some one who took AZ vaccine take any one of mRNA vaccine?
15148,"If yes, How long should they wait to get mRNA?"

15159,Not law.
15160,A recommendation
15161,They also seem to be harder to get right than vaccines
15162,"How much of that is due to *just you* wearing a mask, and how much is due to everyone else around you wearing a mask, surfaces constantly being cleaned, people staying home, etc.?"
15163,You're not going to see the same benefit at all (it will be greatly reduced) if you continue wearing a mask once the rest of these factors have gone away.

15165,"One week later.....on other news, we were wrong, please wear your masks again."
15166,Ok let me sign a waiver at pharmacy.
15167,"From the article:

&gt;Ricardo Garcia describes himself as a “research and development scientist” trained in chemistry at the University of Havana, though he also identifies as a real estate agent."
15168,Most of his customers in the US are Latino Americans.
15169,"&gt;He is also known to be offering to transport bleach in enema form to Europe for use on autistic children, at a cost of $680 per liter plus shipping."
15170,Sounds like he has no problem with poisoning kids.
15171,Its possible but its not something we can say will happen.
15172,I know people who got both shots with no side effects.
15173,I know people whose first dose had side effects while the second dose had none.
15174,It all depends on the persons body how the vaccine will react.
15175,Just got my second dose of Pfizer woohoo 🎉
15176,And some people here actually think we should mandate masks every flu season from now on.
15177,Lol.
15178,Most of those people aren't avoiding vaccination out of spite.
15179,"They're avoiding vaccination because they don't trust the government and pharmaceutical companies, or they simply can't be bothered."
15180,Many of the people with some minor issues with the vaccines would be much more motivated to get them if it meant they could go out without a mask once fully vaccinated.
15181,And morally I personally disagree with the idea that lifting restrictions should be tied to case numbers or % vaccinated.
15182,"IMO if vaccinations stagnate because of a lack of demand, we either need to lift restrictions for everyone or lift restrictions for vaccinated people (without any passports)."
15183,We can't drag on restrictions and wonder why people aren't getting vaccinated.
15184,"The data released by the EMA (European Medicines Agency) was about 1/150,000 for the AZ vaccine."
15185,Those 6 cases could be just the tip of the iceburg for J&amp;J and that's why the CDC/FDA wants to wait a little bit.
15186,They want to allow reports to come in for all the people that were just vaccinated and are in the window for clots.
15187,"I wish people would stop quoting the ""one in a million"" stat - that's likely not even close to the actual risk, it's just what has been reported so far when doctors weren't even aware to look out or report this issue."
15188,Who cares if she jumps the line?
15189,If the President of the United States was a 45 yr old and he got his shot before anyone I wouldn't care (though I can guarantee you the opposite party probably would).

15191,"&gt; the organ damage they are finding with non-vaccinated, asymptomatic people

Source?"
15192,I've heard this repeated quite a bit since the early days of the pandemic but I don't think I've actually seen any solid evidence that significant amounts of people are ending up with organ damage despite asymptomatic or mild illness.
15193,"Yes, that's what I meant."
15194,And I'm pretty sure I made the same spelling mistake once before and someone corrected me.
15195,Gotta remember this.
15196,7 million people being dumb as fuck has nothing to do with insurance companies.
15197,Knowledge is power.

15215,"Indoor masks will still ""feel"" mandatory until then and when it does happen, the dominos will really start falling."
15216,&gt;what else do you want us to do?

15241,He has really bad chills also.
15242,Is this something that will likely resolve or should I do something now?
15243,"Since the narrative seems to be that you need to get vaccinated yearly, won’t the logistics of distributing a two dose vaccine to everyone every year make a “return to normal” difficult?"
15244,How will the country navigate it?
15245,"When you go back to get vaccinated next year, do you need to then stay home six weeks till your two weeks after the second dose?"
15246,"yea based on the demographics of the people who are most likely to be hardcore anti-vax, that isnt surprising."
15247,im pretty sure i read somewhere that the feds were gonna start distributing based on demand but dont quote me on that
15248,We're right on the precipice of being able to operate much more normally.
15249,"The vaccine campaign in the US is going really well, and we're approaching 50% with first doses, which is about where we should start to see a more significant decline in cases/hospitalizations, and should spell the beginning of the end."
15250,"You're also vaccinated - according to the guidelines, you can be close and unmasked with other vaccinated people."
15251,"Sure, in public stores and such there are additional rules, but honestly even the most basic mask wearing seems to be no longer strictly enforced."
15252,Society is moving forward regardless of the guidelines.
15253,"The ""new normal"" is going to be with us for years - you'll see masks worn in public, people much more aware of others showing visible symptoms, remote work continuing to be a thing."
15254,It doesn't mean you have to be a hermit yourself - it's just going to take a while for people to adjust back to the way things were before.
15255,"Like it or not, this is the defining global event of this generation, like 9/11 was for my generation."

15263,Makes sense.
15264,But just because you don't get the vaccine doesn't mean you will get COVID.
15265,So it's not really a fair comparison
15266,True.
15267,I see so many people playing with their face/mouth when they have one on.
15268,May as well just lick everything.
15269,Uh.
15270,No.
15271,It's a global pandemic that is deadly and highly contagious.
15272,We have a solution to the problem.
15273,Get your vaccine and we won't face a giant outbreak that kills another 500k+.
15274,Really not hard.
15275,And it's free.

15277,"just a fyi but in california, you can take up to 80 hours off as paid sick leave to get vaccinated and recover from side effects, and your employer cant make you use your vacation or sick days for that."
15278,"this law affects employees of businesses with more than 25 employees and its also retroactive so if you used vacation or sick days, you can show your employer that law and they will have to give you those days back"

15286,"Even though trump handcuffed companies with exports, once the US vaccinates most every adult, those companies are gonna be allowed shipping to other countries."
15287,There is literally thousands of lives and billions of dollars at stake.
15288,There would be a world wide outrage if they just stopped producing or exporting vaccines after they vaccinate the majority of adults
15289,Ugh I know the headline is kind of misleading (like every article nowadays) but man I don't want to do this again and again.
15290,Yearly flu shots were kind of optional for people with good health/not too old.
15291,Covid is deadlier so it's not really a good comparison to a flu shot as we knew them.
15292,"If it's once every 5-10+ years or something, fine, that's like a tetanus shot, etc."
15293,But jfc where did this virus come from and where does it end if we have to keep getting jabbed so often.
15294,Because being punished with a lockdown for not getting a vaccine is even a discussion?
15295,Does that not sound evil to you?
15296,Honestly once this winds down my vote will go to anyone that vows to abolish public health related emergency powers
15297,&gt;1 in a million blod clot is a terrible idea.
15298,As someone who is part of the impacted demographic (young women) it is frustrating to keep seeing people cite the 1 in a million statistic.
15299,"Because given what we know, it isn't a 1 in a million chance for someone like me."
15300,"We don't know the exact risk, but it's probably more prevalent than 1 in a million for the demographic."
15301,"I got the J&amp;J vaccine, and perhaps I would get it again even with what I know now, but I'm glad they paused to investigate so they can better understand and inform people about the risk."

15311,"So I don’t think it’s a cult, more so people doing the bare minimum."
15312,Tbh I would have preferred govts making n95s mandatory last March and sending them to everyone for free.
15313,Would have ended the pandemic way faster than whatever else they’ve tried to do.
15314,That doesnt make sense?!?!
15315,They are counting the number of these rare clots recorded from Covid infection vs from the vaccine.
15316,"Why would you include asymptomatic cases....the clue is in the name....ie, no symptoms = no clots."
15317,"It's not looking at the rate of these clots from Covid, if it was then you would include asymptomatic cases."
15318,"So based on your argument the COVID vaccine is the same as the flu vaccine, but somehow you had no hesitancy or fear of death from the flu vaccine but won't get the COVID vaccine??"
15319,Not trying to be mean but your reasoning seems a little flawed.
15320,FYI none of the COVID vaccines in north america are attenuated viral vaccines (the flu vaccines are) so in that way they are fundamentally different.
15321,"So you can't ""get covid"" from the vaccine fwiw."
15322,Also the covid vaccines are proven to be much more effective.

15330,I've been getting one every year for over a decade now and I almost never get sick during flu season anymore.
15331,Worth the jab+minor inconvenience in my opinion.
15332,&gt; I don't know that it's any worse now than it ever was though.
15333,"Back when I was a kid everyone I hung out with had pretty much the same views 

It’s worse in that it’s easier to find like minded people with extreme views and extreme views are often promoted with algorithms because they are so engaging."
15334,Both Reddit and Facebook suffer from the first problem but Facebook (and twitter and YouTube) is considerably worse with the second one.
15335,"yes the classic ""if you haven't committed any crimes then you don't have to worry about the police on your block 7 days a week"""
15336,&gt; so is it any wonder why people are like this now?
15337,The people aren't like this now just because there were changes in the CDC guidelines.
15338,"Trump's administration has been against all measures to fight covid, yet here you are clinging to one thing, even if Faucci and the CDC updated their stance."
15339,I for one surely don't envy having to weigh all the options and choose.
15340,"Faucci made a wrong statement there, but it's not like the GOP follows him instead of Trump."
15341,I also get the flu shot every year.
15342,I've never had as many brutal side effects from any vaccine
15343,Very true.
15344,That will make things a lot smoother.
15345,"In before Pfizer says that we'll be needing one every year, just like a flu shot."
15346,Do you think it will be another Hunger Games-type experience to find a booster shot?
15347,"NC is 5 times it's size and about 1.5 million more people, 2444 more cases today and 18 deaths today too."
15348,My coworker was scheduled to get the J&amp;J on Wednesday and the provider canceled her appointment.
15349,Her new Pfizer appointment is now on Saturday.
15350,Some states aren't that efficient on the turn around.
15351,I'm definitely sure it was an episode of the animated series.
15352,There was a communication about a plague on Dramia II.
15353,Yeah I agree but there's no regulations for 2 masks (at least where I live or anywhere I've heard of).
15354,"As long as you have something over your face no one cares, no matter how ineffective it is, hence why I agree with the cult of cloth statement statement."
15355,"Oh lol, that's certainly interesting."
15356,Especially something that has such specific temperature storage requirements
15357,I hope you’re right.
15358,It’s already depressing enough being told to keep distancing and masking after being vaccinated with few very specific exceptions; to prolong this “new normal” even more is torture IMO.
15359,[deleted]
15360,And presumably boosters will be given more ad hoc/staggered instead of trying to vaccinate like 200 million people over the course of 3 months.
15361,"Low to middle income countries gets their doses from COVAX and thus not included in this statistic, as COVAX doses does not need authorization to be exported."
15362,"EU does export to low/middle income cpuntries as well, but it is not shown by this document."
15363,How is this a scam?
15364,This is how many vaccines work.
15365,We get a new flu shot yearly because the virus mutates.
15366,Why would this be different?
15367,I and almost my whole family have taken AZ and none have had issues.
15368,Sure there is a risk but it's outweighed by the probability of getting COVID.
15369,[removed]
15370,Personally I don't like the maintenance of off and on and off.
15371,I'm less conscious of it if I just keep it on whenever I leave the home.
15372,Of course they knew about them.
15373,"Here is a case study of two previously healthy young men under 30 who died from CVT due to Covid that was published in 2020. 

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214751921000037

Just because the general public and media didnt know about them doesnt mean anything."
15374,"All people cared about was that people were dying of Covid, not all the specific ways."
15375,"Deaths indeed appear mostly logarithmic, not 'spiking' per the headline - though daily cases are definitely spiking; their daily peak was 9151 on April 9th 2021; their previous high was 8122 on June 14th 2020, and their daily case curve over the course of the pandemic looks like a half pipe."
15376,"Still, including deaths in the headline is some clickbaity bullshit."
15377,That may happen - this case spike is pretty fresh - but it may not.
15378,"Also:

&gt; Celestino Aos, archbishop of Santiago, was hospitalized Saturday after testing positive to Covid-19, according to Fr."
15379,"Andrés Moro, spokesman for the Santiago Archdiocese."
15380,Aos was released from the hospital Tuesday.
15381,"Monsignor Alberto Lorenzelli, auxiliary bishop of Santiago who lives with the archbishop, also contracted the virus, Moro said."
15382,Both received the Coronavac vaccine.
15383,Those are pretty high-profile breakthrough cases.
15384,"Catholic country, Archdiocese of its capital city, two highest ranking members in the Diocese, live in the same household, both vaccinated, both infected post-vaccination."
15385,"It does cast some very clear, very public doubt on the efficacy of Sinovac (although the Archbishop was hospitalized on Saturday and released on Tuesday so it's entirely likely that its efficacy in preventing severe infection is much more effective than its efficacy in preventing symptomatic infection)."
15386,"Still, it's a bad look for the vaccine in terms of enthusiastic adoption for the remainder of the population."
15387,You're saying the entire class should stay home because they were around someone who hasn't tested positive?
15388,Oh god.
15389,I hate that I needed an /s there.
15390,Oh really?
15391,"Please enlighten me, oh great one, how it's so off brand to comment that vaccines causing blood clots hasn't been peer reviewed, in a thread about vaccines causing blood clots, in response to a comment about waiting until evidence is peer reviewed."
15392,that.... seems really low.
15393,AZ was 7 in 8 million right?
15394,Not reallllly.
15395,Not ones that are actually effective anyways
15396,AFAIK this number does not include doses sent to COVAX as those are exempt from the authorization process.
15397,"Yeah, I admit I was only a sporadic flu shot person myself."
15398,"No real reason, just never went out of the way for it."
15399,"I was young, healthy, I figured if I get the flu whatever."
15400,Obviously I jumped at the chance to get a COVID shot and will start regularly getting my flu shot now.
15401,I don't know how you can be so pro-COVID vaccine and still think getting the flu vaccine is a waste of time.
15402,"The doctors main concern is the virus, not the economy or people’s livelihoods."
15403,They’ll always recommend the conservative approach if it could potentially save even one person from the virus.
15404,Unlikely to be the case.
15405,"Look at the case numbers in Israel - once we achieve that level of drop off in cases/hospitalizations/deaths, there will be no more political will to maintain restrictions on most of society (although I imagine voluntary mask wearing may become a bit of a thing for a while)."
15406,"This sort of thing is to continue to keep the virus at bay - if it's needed at all, it will allow us to fend off any new major outbreaks, as there will still be large portions of the world unvaccinated over the next few years which will continue to lead to clusters popping up in the vaccinated world."
15407,"The idea is to crush the levels of COVID to a small number, and then continue to use boosters every year or so to keep antibody levels high and add additional protections to any new variants that might be causing trouble."
15408,"If we are successful at this, the rates of COVID spread in society will drop like a stone and remain very low for the foreseeable future."
15409,Take a look at the subs OP posts in
15410,It was a joke aimed at the guy who couldn't think of a pro for getting vaccinated early against a potentially deadly disease
15411,I mean the CDC did studies to show wearing 2 surgical masks or even a surgical mask + cloth mask is very effective.
15412,So you don’t have to get an n95 per say.
15413,"And yes I know some people have those flimsy cloth masks or even bandanas on their face, and those probably do nothing, but if I had to guess those people are just wearing a mask cause it’s a rule where they live, and they’re not too bothered with being protected."
15414,I’ll wear a single surgical mask if I’m just doing errands.
15415,"Easier to keep it on even outdoors vs taking it on, putting it back on etc."
15416,If I’m using public transit I’ll wear 2 cause let’s face it there’s always times when you’re on a crowded bus or some idiot sitting near you takes their mask off to sneeze and barely covers their mouth (happened to me a few days ago).
15417,Yeah and last fall the former director of the CDC saying he’d rather have a mask than a vaccine (wtf?)
15418,"Hello, conspiracies such as “the vaccine gives you a chip, the vaccine grows you a 3rd limb, the vaccine is made by the deep state, the vaccine killed X famous person, the vaccine is made out of x y z things that are found in x poison, the vaccine will make you infertile, the vaccine will make you a zombie,” just like that I can continue, just the spread of misinformation does not sit right with me personally."
15419,"to your point about the passports, yes, anyone with a working mind could notice that Covid vaccine passwords would be a thing."
15420,I do not think it is in the countries best interest to let people in their country carrying a virus that could kill their citizens.
15421,"Regardless, that’s a discussion for another moment."
15422,Cheers!
15423,If you really think 4 states are gonna hold out while 46 have done away with them I think you're in for a big surprise lmao.
15424,"They're all gonna be gone by August, feel free to !remindme"
15425,Ship them up to Michigan and other high rate states.
15426,[removed]
15427,"Yeah, the idea that immunity will not be for life is not surprising."
15428,"However, ""within 12 months"" is very specific."
15429,Yes
15430,I'm in the stats finally!
15431,Got my first shot of Pzifer yesterday.
15432,Really sore arm which is already better.
15433,[deleted]
15434,"&gt; but the way we treat covid is simply not the same as we treat the flu

Not right now, of course not."
15435,But that will change when it's no longer a raging pandemic killing thousands of people every day.
15436,"Then it will become more like the flu, and we will treat it the same way."
15437,"Well remember that Pfizer wasn't looking at infections, just serious symptoms in its trial."
15438,"Also, the trials had all sorts of problems since they didn't have many serious cases in the placebo control groups."
15439,"SO their efficacy rates can be very inaccurate:

https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/03/pfizer-moderna-and-johnson-johnson-vaccines-compared/618226/

&gt;The two vaccine trials that did explicitly report hospitalizations as an efficacy outcome make this latter issue very clear."
15440,"For the AstraZeneca vaccine, one person in the control group had severe COVID-19, but eight people were hospitalized; for Johnson &amp; Johnson, 34 people in the placebo group had severe COVID-19, but only five people were hospitalized."
15441,It’s true that zero vaccinated people were hospitalized in either study after the vaccines took effect.
15442,"But with numbers that small, you can’t draw a reliable conclusion about how high efficacy may be for these outcomes."
15443,"&gt;As Diana Zuckerman of the National Center for Health Research pointed out about the Johnson &amp; Johnson trial, “It’s misleading to tell the public that nobody who was vaccinated was hospitalized unless you also tell them that only 5 people in the placebo group were hospitalized.” She’s right."
15444,"And you can’t be confident about predicting effectiveness precisely in a wider population outside the trial, either."
15445,"For example, some of the vaccine trials included relatively few people older than 60 as participants."
15446,&gt;You can see how fragile these numbers are by looking at those compiled for severe disease.
15447,"**In the Pfizer trial, for example, just one vaccinated person developed severe COVID-19 versus three in the placebo group—which meant that a single bout of disease made the difference between a calculated efficacy rate of 66 percent and one of 100 percent."
15448,"**

&gt;For the Novavax and Oxford-AstraZeneca trials, there were zero people with severe disease in the vaccinated group versus only one in the control group, so adding or subtracting one would have been even more dramatic."
15449,**The problem is even greater for deaths.
15450,"For that efficacy analysis, only two of the vaccine trials—for Moderna’s and Johnson &amp; Johnson’s—reported any COVID-19 deaths at all in the control groups."
15451,**
15452,I think the main concern is that the world shut down to avoid covid and its symptoms where as people are being encouraged to get vaccinated.. 8x seems like a worryingly low number.
15453,Let use the vaccines that don't have this documented effect.
15454,That's a valid question.
15455,"While I have a healthy skepticism of ""experts"", I've found that Fauci has been a reliable source of info."
15456,He says he won't be eating in restaurants until we know more.'
15457,"The way I look at it, it's a balance between risk and reward."
15458,"I love eating out, but not so much that I'm willing to go take my mask off in an indoor situation with only about 20% of the population being vaccinated."
15459,I'm willing to do limited activities for another 6 months.
15460,Some people do not have that luxury.
15461,They have to go to work or put their kids in school.
15462,I don't have to eat in a restaurant or go to a gym.
15463,Why wold I add to risk of others for a small reward for myself?
15464,I also look at places like Michigan.
15465,The legislature took the governor's powers to lock down away.
15466,Case numbers have been soaring ever since.
15467,"When you can see real-world examples of what happens when you open too soon, it's not hard to decide to be cautious."
15468,Might there be a time when we know we'll never have a handle on this virus and we can either live our lives or not?
15469,"Sure, there might."
15470,But I would expect that to lead to prudent people finding a way to stay safer while going on with their lives.
15471,It may mean developing better masks that you can wear all the time.
15472,It might mean engineering better indoor air filtration systems.
15473,I've seen first hand what Covid can mean to someone.
15474,"My cousin got a mild case back in March, 2020."
15475,She still has trouble with her sense of smell and there are a lot of foods that taste wrong to her.
15476,Many taste or smell like vomit or gasoline.
15477,She's been living with that for a full year.
15478,I don't think she's worried about whether she'll ever eat out again given that she lives mostly on plain pasta and potatoes.
15479,She's financially well off and has access to the best medical care and they can't help her.
15480,I'm more than willing to continue to take precautions rather than risk living the rest of my life like that.
15481,But I don't think the pandemic will last forever.
15482,We already have some good vaccines and they were developed in a really short period of time.
15483,I expect more improvements.
15484,It will take several years and more than 2 shots to get to the status controll covid and we get back to our new normal.
15485,That’s true.
15486,But I thought Johnson and Johnson’s AdVac technology revolved around Ad26.
15487,Wouldn’t they have to start from scratch with a new vector?
15488,Don’t think the pharmaceutical companies are just not being compensated.
15489,"Actually if you read the article, it was mentioned that it was a recording on April 1st, two weeks ago."
15490,"Plus, the headline is misleading."
15491,It was considering boosters against variants of concerns.
15492,"For a majority of the population they'd still be quite protected, but for the highest risk of the population this is an extra option to be safe."
15493,"What about those of us who have had the virus, had very mild symptoms and have been tested for antibodies in our blood."
15494,Why should we take the risk of this vaccine?
15495,I'd rather risk COVID again.
15496,I had almost no symptoms and according to my doctor I should not take the vaccine right now until it's officially FDA approved.
15497,True.
15498,"I’m thinking the tri-state region and California will be the last holdouts for mask mandates, while the other states will likely begin to phase them out between May  and August."
15499,or maybe because none are FDA approved and MRNA research on vaccines is minimal to none!
15500,"Yes, instead we get 500 news articles about how the vaccines will never work on the boogeyman variants that are coming and why you need to hide in a closet after you get vaccinated."
15501,So the logic goes.
15502,I think a lot of the variant fear is being driven by scientists who are much more focused on uncertainty than the average person.
15503,They'll never say something is safe; they'll only say there's a small chance that it's dangerous.
15504,"A few months back, it seemed like there was a big concerted push to get people to double-mask and then that push just stopped."
15505,I wonder why that got dropped.
15506,I use %pts at work for percentage point changes and it seems to be fairly well understood.
15507,I got mine two weeks ago tomorrow but I’m male so I’m not as worried.
15508,Best of luck to you.
15509,I’m sure you will be fine.
15510,it wont happen in our lifetimes.
15511,"The fact is not only do politicians not want it because they get money from insurance companies, but Americans themselves are against it."
15512,"Yeah, they're against getting chemotherapy and surgery for free because it means their tax dollars are going to 'communism'."
15513,That's why Bernie never won.
15514,All you need to do is say 'communism' and people go ape shit.
15515,Like pulling a trigger.
15516,Little do they know that America has become a glorified third world country.
15517,"Getting my first shot in Friday, what has it been like?"
15518,Send it to New Zealand please.
15519,I don’t know anyone who knows anyone who’s had one of our super rare vaccines
15520,Great.
15521,I can already hear the antivaxxers gathering new ammo.
15522,"Yes, I'm aware of that."
15523,"Convincing people to follow public health measures, however, **is** a political thing."
15524,"And turning into into an ""us vs. them"" thing was not the way to go to convince people to follow said measures."
15525,[deleted]
15526,"Depends on the industries, but some types of jobs benefit from in-person collaboration."
15527,"Also, having an office can be helpful if you need a space to invite clients or vendors to for meetings."
15528,"Some workplaces also offer free perks to employees, such as a free gym, free coffee and other snacks, etc."
15529,It's not as cut and dry as just saying that office spaces are a waste of money.
15530,It's highly dependent on each specific case.
15531,"I will say, though, that commuting is a horrible contributor to carbon emissions, which is a huge reason to cut down on in-office days even with companies that need to keep an office around."
15532,"I suggest going to Turkey, they have been pretty relaxed about who enters as long as you have a negative COVID test."
15533,"Makes sense, but I don’t think this fact is really... useful?"
15534,"It’s not going to really help us convince vaccine-hesitant people to get it, because messaging that “if you’re vaccine hesitant you’re dumb” is probably not actually going to change a vaccine-hesitant person’s mind (even though it’s true 😬)."
15535,"Like, it feels good to say “LOL anti-vaxers are so dumb” but how does this actually help us increase vaccine uptake?"
15536,I’d image that using this for messaging would just make anti-vaxers dig their heels in
15537,[deleted]
15538,Israel didn’t see significant case decline until they had about 56% of the adult population fully vaccinated.
15539,We have less than 30% fully vaccinated.
15540,"(Fully meaning both doses, etc)

It’s simple math."
15541,"We’re not at herd immunity yet, it’s that simple."
15542,Including people who got infected.
15543,We’re just simply no where near 60% with antibodies.
15544,There’s still ton of susceptible hosts around here.
15545,Edit: current projects were 6-8 weeks away from vaccinating everyone who wants one.
15546,I’d like for you to cite for me a single instance where 30 percent of a preschool class died of COVID.
15547,[removed]
15548,They'll want it to end by the midterm elections.
15549,"They took a chance and it worked in 2020, but it won't work again."
15550,[removed]
15551,No.
15552,"If you have insurance, they might charge your insurance the actual cost for administering the shot, but that cost cannot be passed along to you."
15553,"If you don't have insurance (or choose not to provide your insurance info) the government covers it, I believe."
15554,"In any case, there is no cost to you to get the shot."
15555,They weren't given syphilis.
15556,They were lied to about getting treated for it.
15557,And somehow that went on for decades.
15558,Imagine having a kid if you can't even afford a car seat.
15559,[deleted]
15560,How's the part we find out the vax is killing us?
15561,Cool
15562,"If a lockdown is ordered, and no one complies with it, does it really happen?"
15563,Same.
15564,I'm done.
15565,I wonder if some of that is J&amp;J being held?
15566,"I don't know where the 'pause' ends in the supply chain, e.g."
15567,if they are delivering them to immediately restart once the okay is given to start administering them again or if the gov't is not even shipping any to states until that happens.
15568,"Based on the Israel model, most likely."
15569,"But regardless of infections, Covid is now almost irrelevant in Massachusetts."
15570,About 10 people are dying per day in a state of nearly 7 million people.
15571,Natural selection is what they call it
15572,Probably they do not reach R0&gt;1
15573,So when do we go back to normal now?
15574,I understand we will now have an annual covid.
15575,Flu shot but can we ever stop wearing masks?
15576,Me too
15577,"Well, the other reason for trials is also to find out what dose the kids need."
15578,Just adding this.
15579,Tentative dates for full FDA approval for Pfizer/Moderna?
15580,"It just takes one news headline like ""26 year old pretty white girl dies from J&amp;J vaccine"" to create a media-fueled outrage feedback loop, even if said 26-year old made the decision after being fully informed."
15581,"It's not just about the people receiving the shots, it's about the people watching the news about the shots, and the FDA has to take a long-term view to make sure that people continue to trust our medical system."
15582,It will be combined with the flu shot and it will not be twice a year.
15583,My guess is in the long run it will be every 2 to 3 years but probably once a year in the meantime until more of the world gets vaccinated
15584,"It's been a target for a long time, to both have a more effective seasonal flu vaccine and have something resistant to likely pandemic strains."
15585,"Pandemic flu is incredibly fast, much faster burns than COVID."
15586,We want a vaccine for that ahead of time.
15587,I wish treatments like this would get more press and become widely used.
15588,Would help my Covid anxiety so much!
15589,Why do you think this changed?
15590,"Vaccination of the elderly, or new variant?"
15591,[removed]
15592,Yeah lol @ the guy who clearly doesn't live here.
15593,We never were locked up either.
15594,If this turns into a 2x per year shot people are going to be pissed.
15595,Once a year flu vaccine is hard enough to get people to take
15596,"Lol, i guess so!"
15597,"It’s crazy to think even in the covid sub people believe that masks are going away soon just bc some anti-science states already took away the mandate, iirc cdc projections are for continued masking up/handwashing/social distancing throughout summer at minimum until enough population gets fully vaccinated"
15598,I would argue that it's already very much endemic at this point.
15599,"And I'll gladly get the booster, as COVID is the first endemic, airborne blood disease that we've had circulate in society."
15600,Thanks for putting this together everyday!
15601,"Knew it was only a matter of when, but disheartened to see the first doses tailing off already."
15602,"I know there are headwinds with J&amp;J (15M dose supply &amp; clotting) as well as younger, working folks being the remaining population...but would have liked to see us 55-60% before the tail off."
15603,"Manchester does have an airport, but at this point, the case patterns in NH are pretty much the same as they are everywhere--the bigger the city and the more densely populated the area, the more prevalent covid is."
15604,That seems incredibly optimistic.
15605,What about states that seem to be running out of extremely motivated individuals at around 30%?
15606,Sounds like you’re going through a lot!
15607,You aren’t alone in feeling the way you do.
15608,"I admire your drive and dedication to going out, despite having OCD (which would be quite a challenge during covid) — good for you."
15609,Keep it up!
15610,Focus on the power of these amazing vaccines!
15611,"They're not doing it just for fun or extra money, sure thats a component of running a business but if it wasn't necessary they wouldn't waste time creating a new product that would have no market."
15612,"They didn't intentionally make the first one weaker to make you buy another, its just a fast mutating virus that will be in our lives going forward like the flu most likely."
15613,"The virus itself will likely mutate in a direction where the symptoms are less lethal as killing its hosts isn't in a virus's best interest to spread, so eventually it will probably be fine to pass on the yearly update as long as death becomes less of an issue."
15614,"I don't think there's anything special about J&amp;J where they wont need this either, they're only just getting out their first batches and will likely also come up with a booster later."
15615,And were thinking once we hit 50% we will start seeing a big decline in infections?
15616,I’m just so desperate to see a decline in case numbers.
15617,We were recording SSN in the beginning but we don't do that anymore.
15618,[This model by Youyang Gu](https://covid19-projections.com/path-to-herd-immunity/) predicts cases will start declining in about a week.
15619,It was last updated in early March when cases were still falling and so far has perfectly predicted this plateau/gradual rise.
15620,"Thanks, the worry in particular wasn't mine, but I couldn't come up with anything to ease my friends nerves (despite us both having been fully vaccinated)."
15621,"The percentage is actually even lower since they said 29% of cases were asymptomatic (therefore 71% with serious symptoms), so the odds are even lower."
15622,"I'm not even an anti-masker or anti-vaxxer, but what's the whole point then?"

15625,"&gt;I think the thing that makes this all a non-issue for me is that the rate of occurrence is statistically insignificant, and I mean that in a very direct interpretation of the term."
15626,"At the risk of being a pedant, this is not what statistical significance means."
15627,An event can be extremely rare and still have a statistically significant relationship with some other factor.
15628,Statistical significance is a measure of how likely an apparent relationship in data is there by random chance.
15629,"If that chance is low enough (generally less than 5%), we consider the observation to be statistically significant."
15630,"It is more difficult to find statistically significant relationships for rare events, but not impossible."
15631,Copays tend to be between 10-35 depending on visit type.
15632,I know that is still a burden but it’s not 100s of dollars like the original comment leads you to believe.
15633,"I think that depends on the how the adolescent roll out goes but yes, I think we've peaked otherwise."
15634,Many states have already hit the demand wall and that will only increase from here.
15635,This was the case for the AstraZeneca vaccine.
15636,"Still, paying more wouldn't have resulted in more deliveries."
15637,I don't get how you made that connection.
15638,"I have not seen any news regarding ""cheaping out on the deal"" with the other manufacturers."
15639,They will most likely give a general statement saying what groups need it.
15640,And probably recommending it for others which universities or companies could do what they want with it
15641,"It does seem common sense, but not everybody is so reasonable."
15642,"I read a commentary about Australia, which relied mostly on AZ, but got 1m of Biontech, supposed to be used for doctors and medics, but all of the government got vaccinated with Biontech early, while normal people their age will now have to wait until Q4, and might be forced to take AZ if there is no alternative."
15643,The government now says there is no hurry.
15644,So is arsenic.
15645,By the time the J&amp;J issued is resolved demand will start being a much bigger issue so i could easily see that.
15646,I think so.
15647,"By the time J&amp;J gets unpaused and their numbers start ramping up, demand will be more of an issue then supply (its in issue in some areas already)"
15648,What is the government doing to increase outreach to these communities?
15649,They came up with a comprehensive plan to vaccinate black and brown communities to tackle vaccine hesitation and increase access.
15650,I don’t see why that can’t be done for these communities as well.
15651,More or less they banked on having their own production be much better than external (mostly US really) production.
15652,Then when their production ended up kinda sucking they annoyed that they couldn’t get any from anywhere else.
15653,This.
15654,I honestly want a one shot vaccine because it speeds up the process immunization
15655,You found one out of thousands of professional athletes who was hospitalized while all of them ignored social distancing and masks to play sports for a year.
15656,Not sure how you think that proves a point.
15657,"Biased mods already deleted this post, so you're just wasting my time."
15658,Zero deaths among pro athletes and single digit hospitalizations entirely support the academic study you're trying to refute.
15659,Technically not free if you pay taxes.
15660,"Ahh, I'm the same way!"
15661,I'm getting my shot on Monday and I am so nervous.
15662,"In 34F and have had my children, so the infertility stuff is a  non issue for me."
15663,"But other things get stuck in my head, like a random blood clot or stroke or seizure."
15664,I hate anxiety.
15665,Makes the most rational people into total paranoid puddles.
15666,"Lol

Good luck to you!"
15667,I have no answers but I hope you find them!
15668,Yeah I’ll believe it when I see it
15669,I swore I read somewhere that there was development for a flu vaccine that you only have to take a couple of years as opposed to every year.
15670,"It's an unusual type of clot only really ever seen from people taking blood thinners, and these people weren't taking blood thinners."
15671,"&gt; it seems they're going down the same path of the US

Uh?"
15672,We're still doing social distancing better than the US (in most EU countries).
15673,It's only the vaccinations which are causing problems.
15674,Well how about over 1 million Entitled Americans have bought fake vaccine cards brought to you by Facebook Instagram Twitter Esty EBay!
15675,our government does nothing nothing nothing these medium moguls should be put in prison for 100 years they mess with the politics and now they’re messing with peoples lives prison prison prison.
15676,Lol btw a $5K fine if your family can afford it.
15677,Wtf
15678,"&gt; Our takeaway from this is that it’s not impossible

Not impossible shouldn’t be the standard."
15679,We have allowed absolutely safety to become the standard.
15680,You are more likely to die or get seriously injured in your car on the way to the grocery store than you are to die from coronavirus you might contract at the grocery store.
15681,"&gt; I think 200,000,000 doses will have been administered tomorrow."
15682,"I know Biden has a goal of 200,000,000 doses in one hundred days, but I'm not totally clear on how many doses were administered under Trump."
15683,"Either way being the first country to reach 200,000,000 doses is just absolutely fantastic."
15684,"According to the CDC, 20.4M doses were administered by January 19th, meaning we have about 22M doses to go to hit the 200M in 100 days goal."
15685,Why not vaccinate your own population first though?
15686,"America did what they were supposed to do, the EU didn't."
15687,I'm European btw.
15688,In Denmark we are talking 2-4 weeks extra to get either Pfizer or Moderna.

15699,Got mine yesterday and I'm feeling like shit.
15700,"Obviously it's completely worth it and I would do it 10 times over if i had to, but the first shot did nothing to me and the second shot has me on my ass."
15701,"Manchester has an airport, doesn't it?"
15702,Maybe that contributes to it....
15703,Has the first dose average peaked?
15704,Also in Canada.
15705,"We just surpassed the USA somehow in the most cases per capita, and it keeps on rising."
15706,It seems vaccines are our only way out...and we had a major supply issue of those even before the AZ and J&amp;J issues.
15707,Correct.

15713,"Everyone is tired of restrictions and business owners want to reopen again to save their existence, I really get it."
15714,"So, now you allow vaccinated citizens to move freely, which also seems reasonable."
15715,"I fear that this could lead to everyone who's not yet vaccinated to basically go ""Many are already vaxxed, so I don't need to get a shot and they can't track everyone's vaccination status."
15716,""", leading to sharp decline in vaccination numbers and potential spreaders meeting up."
15717,"I acknowledge that firm anti-vaxxers will likely never take the shot unless forced by their employer or the goverment, so I don't consider them in this scenario."
15718,I'd be more happy if the CDC makes your recommendation with the caviat of the opened states needing to have a percentage of their citizens vaccinated to encourage participation.
15719,"After all, nobody really wants to re-enter lockdown or sanctions if the case numbers spike, so that seems like a one-way street to me."
15720,Does that seem feasible or is it expecting too much cooperation?
15721,It will essentially be a quarterly dose and I’m a no.
15722,"Manchester has had the most cases in the state (11,000)."
15723,Unsurprising since Manchester is the biggest city in the state.
15724,"Nashua has had 7,400 cases."
15725,"Salem has had 2,800 cases."
15726,Both Manchester and Salem have had about 10% of their population diagnosed with covid.
15727,Nashua has had 8% diagnosed with covid.
15728,It has nothing to do with it being mRNA or not.
15729,It's just exposing you to another antigen.
15730,"I can think of no reason why they would be ""incompatible""."
15731,Not even with j&amp;j or az.
15732,It's just another antigen
15733,"It tells you a lot about how worth European lives are these days; if you read the article those vaccines mostly went to Japan, UK and Canada (obviously very few to other low middle income countries)."

15737,I had my first dose 3/22 and second 4/12.
15738,"First dose: chills, fever, muscle aches, very sore at injection site."
15739,Lasted for about 72 hours.
15740,"Second dose: chills, fever for a few hours, soreness at injection site, and a headache."
15741,Felt back to normal 36 hours following injection.
15742,"Back before Fauci knew how effective these vaccines would be, he predicted that at least seventy percent of the population would need to be vaccinated to reach herd immunity."
15743,"I don't believe he accounted for natural immunity, and I don't believe he was considering that we'd be dealing with a practically perfect vaccine."
15744,"Based on your current numbers, it feels ***extremely*** likely that the United States will have near herd immunity before July."
15745,"There will still be cases of course, there are cases of the bubonic plague, but I think the overwhelming majority of people, including politicians, will consider this over when we're at a position where seventy percent of the population is vaccinated."
15746,"I suppose my main question would be about how much natural immunity pushes this up, especially in children."
15747,"We know the virus spreads very quickly among kids, and the CDC estimates that there are about four undetected infections for every positive test."
15748,"I think that's going to be a state to state issue based on how much natural immunity is present based on state actions throughout the pandemic, it's going to be a bit hard to predict, but it's all good news and that's just great."
15749,"That's from Kessler, who's with the Biden admin, not the Pfizer CEO."
15750,"However, I agree with the other comment about hearing the quote from the CEO before jump out to conclusions."

15755,"However, if those side effects are not seen in other demographics, we need to continue to utilize them."
15756,"In an environment where people are very prone to spread misinformation, it's prudent to wait the extra 30 min to 1 hour so you have the full story."
15757,"It's clear now that they've updated this that the CEO stated that they're doing this out of an abundance of caution, not because they know we'll need another shot in 12 months."
15758,This is the same thing Moderna said back in January.
15759,"""So I think for planning purposes, planning purposes only, I think we should expect that we may have to boost."""

15770,I got my vaccine at one of the MEGA pod / Govt run sites and it was so well run and such a pleasant experience.
15771,And (prior to the pause) they were giving J&amp;J to family members who joined the person getting vaccinated.

15803,"No, they didn't."
15804,Afaik no study has been done on the efficacy of one shot of the mRNA vaccines beyond a period of ~month.
15805,We don't know how effective it would be after several months or a year.

15808,My grandmother just got her second Pfizer shot but she had an accident about a week prior that put her in the hospital.
15809,She has trouble getting around to begin with so it was an effort getting her to the site for her second shot.

15817,One of the things the study mentioned was that they couldn't actually verify those people had blood clots.
15818,When you're talking about 5k people with blood clots the chances for misdiagnose of more than a handful of cases is low.
15819,Out of 20 people if 10 people actually didn't have blood clots the data chances completely.
15820,More over this could be people who are found to have other unknown health issues.
15821,Maybe initially they find a blood clot but over the next few weeks you find 5 of them actually had undiagnosed cancer and/or other issues and those are what probably caused the clot.
15822,With so few cases drawing significant conclusions is near enough impossible based on potentially early and unfinished testing and other potential causes.

That doesn't seem to be correct."
15873,"I've seen some stuff about it causing damage to cells within the nose and that causing it:

https://hms.harvard.edu/news/how-covid-19-causes-loss-smell

&gt;Now, an international team of researchers led by neuroscientists at Harvard Medical School has identified the olfactory cell types in the upper nasal cavity most vulnerable to infection by SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19."
15874,"&gt;Surprisingly, sensory neurons that detect and transmit the sense of smell to the brain are not among the vulnerable cell types."
15875,I got covid back in November and I still have 0% use of smell and maybe 25% of my taste back.
15876,"I was fairly lucky that those were the only symptoms besides severe fatigue, but if covid can do that to my taste and smell, imagine what other nerve damage/side affects are possible, especially long term."
15877,I decided to get the vaccine despite working from home because I don’t want someone else to die from covid.
15878,"My family swears up and down that the vaccine will kill you and it’s experimental, but I just remind them that covid itself is more unknown than the vaccine."
15879,"Despite the headline, I think studies like this are helpful when making the calculation about whether the vaccine risk is worth it or not."
15880,"Taking the virus prevalence in the population and using it to calculate chance of infection, then applying this ""8 times higher"" risk, should help to tell you whether the vaccine has more risk of causing harm than your chance of getting the same harm from the virus

Obviously other factors come in to play, like whether other vaccines are (or will soon be) available, but it's a piece of the puzzle nonetheless"

15893,"Given that he said just a few months back that he thinks districts need to decide the actions they take themselves - and hailing it as local control, it's odd."

15904,"As I said in my original comment, there is no data on whether those who get it after being vaccinated will have long Covid or organ damage like those who were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms."
15905,They also still don't know if you can transmit Covid to others if you get it after being vaccinated.
15906,"Given that we are a long way from the 80% vaccination rate needed for herd immunity, it's not just about me."

15919,Seems pretty selfish.
15920,The booster will have the South Africa-based spike.
15921,I think what you are saying is reasonable having said that.
15922,The mutation rate will likely slow down as more people get immunity.
15923,Even with influenza shots the strains are not updated that often for each particular one.
15924,Usually one strain will be updated in a given year but H3N2 usually mutates enough to require a new vaccine every three years H1N1 about every six and influenza B about every 10.
15925,With common cold coronaviruses they mutate at about the same rate as influenza B so that will probably be the future of this thing in the long run

15930,"Kaiser just lowered their BMI requirement to over 25, which catches a LOT of people."
15931,2 - Some vaccination sites and counties just straight up started offering them to anyone who lived in a certain county or zip code who was over the age of 16.
15932,That's what happened to me - the city of Berkeley just started offering them to everyone who lived in Berkeley over the age of 16 at a mass vaccination site.

16001,When I'm blocked from doing that I immediately become skeptical as anyone else should.
16002,From the CDC they found the second derivative (daily growth rates of deaths) was reduced almost 2% after 100 days.
16003,"&gt; Mask mandates were associated with a 0.7 percentage point decrease (p = 0.03) in daily COVID-19 death growth rates 1–20 days after implementation and decreases of 1.0, 1.4, 1.6, and 1.9 percentage points 21–40, 41–60, 61–80, and 81–100 days, respectively, after implementation (p&lt;0.01 for all)."

And yet the paper fails to report on the area under the curve."

16007,What does a 2% reduction in the second derivative amount to in total deaths?

16137,"You're saying the same thing, but from the opposite direction."
16138,"Instead of 100 people getting infected, you get 5."
16139,That's the vaccine being ineffective in 5% of cases.
16140,"&gt;demyelinating polyneuropathy

UK has vaccinated (one shot) a lot higher percentage of the population than the US."
16141,61% of people in the UK have received at least one shot.
16142,In the US that number is only 37%.
16143,This is largely due to the UK stressing full population coverage on the first dose rather than having people fully vaccinated with both doses.
16144,"Because a single dose is fairly effective (at least short term), from a public health perspective that choice was the better choice."
16145,"Anyway, because of this different coverage you can't  use US and UK data to compare Pfizer and AZ."
16146,[removed]
16147,You done it now.
16148,Pack it up and walk away before they come for you.
16149,I don’t think that anyone in the field of education believes that kids are better off with zoom school than real school.
16150,Especially for young kids that don’t even know how to read—wtf?
16151,This is very much about socialization.
16152,You don’t need zoom school to learn how to interact with technology (are there seriously concerns that kids are not keeping up new technology?)
16153,"If it can save one person by banning it, wouldn’t you ban it?"
16154,What if that person does is someone from your family??
16155,?
16156,"It’s the right decision but he’s a bit naive, IMO, that it will “drastically improve our faith in public health institutions” it won’t change the minds of those whose minds are made up"
16157,Mine gives out free car seats to low income families.
16158,Health departments are a great potential resource for anyone in bad financial situations.
16159,"My mum has actually had her first dose, she’s a NHS lead nurse!"
16160,I think it was a month or so ago she got hers.
16161,Peppers still taste weird to her for now :(
16162,It makes sense because the affordable care act mandates that insurance companies cover vaccines.
16163,I have gotten many vaccines since that law passed and all of them were free.
16164,Why would the coronavirus one not be?
16165,"In the town with two barbers, go to the guy who had the worst haircut."

16169,Many are misinterpreting what was reported.
16170,But not all classes have to be held in person.
16171,1/100?
16172,Are you fucking kidding me?!
16173,It’s orders of magnitudes smaller than that you moron.
16174,Bc you can get covid twice and now there are other variants
16175,Time to bust out the tranquilizer guns
16176,"The whole article is ""covid is mutating like it already has over 7,000 times and one of those mutations could possibly lead it to becoming deadlier"""
16177,"If we are speaking about absolute numbers then you are right, more people will die for sure because of this (directly or indirectly)."
16178,But this is also an ethical issue.
16179,You are giving something to healthy people without them even knowing about this potential risk.
16180,Moreover there are safer alternatives for certain demographics.
16181,"i love it when people are like ""look, astrazeneca vaccine is better than pfizer"" when  the data from uk are based on 1 dose."
16182,That dude is a beast!
16183,"Besides not sleeping for days, he knew TONS of hard-core facts and numbers off the cuff about the tiniest county or city."
16184,I used a diaphragm for decades - usually without spermicide because I'm lazy and was in a ltr where we wanted kids in general - and didn't ever get pregnant when using the diaphragm.
16185,I got pregnant easily enough without it though.
16186,So it was effective.
16187,"I couldn't tolerate the pill, made me crazy/could feel how it changed me and I didn't like not feeling like myself so stopped taking it after a month."
16188,I dislike how manipulating hormones is so readily pushed on women
16189,"This isn’t a matter of “should parents be allowed to homeschool or online school their kids”, it’s a matter of “is 5 day in-person schooling available for all kids in California in the fall once adults have had plenty of opportunity or be vaccinated”"
16190,"What really matters here is to see it’s effects on current vaccines 

While Moderna already has an effective booster shot targeting variants with E484K like mutations, needing another round of shots will be a big problem for many countries"
16191,"Yep, my dad had covid and despite medium symptoms, he was done with it in good terms."
16192,Until he almost had a heart attack.
16193,Why?
16194,"After exams, a blood cot in a vein next to the heart blocking 90% of it, causing heart failure."
16195,"He did surgery to put the thing that expands the vein or artery, and was saved."
16196,"To be honest, I don't like to hear about these side effects on vaccines."
16197,"Not ideal, but, compared to what covid variant is doing here its nothing."
16198,"We have now average of 3.5k thousand deaths a day in the country, hospitals full, medications for incubation running VERY low, and now the variant is getting young people more than old really."
16199,"Hospitals have  average of 30 something years old in ICU now, and lots of younh people from 20 to 40 dying of it, healthy people."
16200,"Sure, it still is a low percentage when compared to how many got it and specially on this age, but its growing."
16201,Death rate its average 4% in the country.
16202,Id take the vaccine in a heart beat
16203,"Even if the risks were exactly the same, a blood clot is not transmittable to other people you come into contact with while having one."
16204,So the net societal risk is still lower with the vaccine than without it.
16205,Finally got my second Pfizer shot and i’m so fucking hyped to get back to normal
16206,There are lots of factors involved that pull in different directions.
16207,They are also more likely to have the free time in the middle of the day to go get one vs younger folks.
16208,"But they also are more likely to have mobility issues like difficulty driving, or issues getting appointments with most things being online."
16209,I think its hard to generalize the 65+ number on other subgroups.
16210,"Sad that even if you had to pay for it, that many people can’t afford it."
16211,I’m still shocked that people don’t realize just how *horrible* the side effects of overly cautious policy decisions made in March/April 2020 were.
16212,Ignorance is bliss I guess.
16213,"I would include erosion of public trust in institutions in those side effects, which has made it harder to obtain compliance with restrictions and vaccination efforts ever since."
16214,It's a global effort.
16215,I was supposed to be scheduled to get my 2nd Pfizer dose with Walgreens but it says I have no upcoming appointments?
16216,I was trying to re-schedule because they originally scheduled me to come in 4 weeks later.
16217,The entire area around me has zero appointments available but I really need my 2nd shot.
16218,Thanks.
16219,"Yeah, that's because they aren't for-profit organizations (though government know if with civil forfeiture and tickets)."
16220,It's the first step to 100% everything is done.
16221,This happened in Arizona and within a week of what do you mean 100% but with like masks and tables that are still blocked off?
16222,2 weeks later everything here was completely open and maskless.
16223,I expect the same thing to happen in Denver.
16224,[removed]
16225,It's quite remarkable how much better things have gotten over the past few months.
16226,In December and January my hospital was inundated with patients.
16227,"Almost every floor was converted to a COVID unit, patients were double and sometimes triple roomed, and outpatient physicians had to be pulled to cover the inpatient floors."
16228,"This past week I saw just one COVID+ patient after a whole week of rounding, and even he was an asymptomatic positive who was admitted for a non-related issue."
16229,You weren't in the protected period.
16230,Likely you were infected before your body mounted an effective immune response to the vaccine.
16231,I know it's free and I got my vaccine and was still surprised if was free.
16232,"Healthcare and ""free"" just doesn't compute here."
16233,"Seriously, I was surprised there weren't hidden fees or lots of paperwork to ""qualify"" for not having to pay for the dose."
16234,Was genuinely surprised how quick and easy it was.
16235,I literally brought along a book to read and was barely able to finish a chapter; the longest wait was the 15 minute wait to check for allergic reactions.
16236,"I got wiped out, too (got my first Pfizer shot yesterday)."
16237,For some reason I thought I’d be in some condition to do school work (I wasn’t) and failed one of my quizzes lol

16240,"New Hampshire is now open to non-residents, IIRC - might be time for a road trip!"

16242,Half-points for those Japanese officials spending the “repurposed” money on museums and not themselves.
16243,Depends on your age.
16244,If you're under 30 I'd plan on having a fever and feeling a bit rubbish the day after.
16245,"You might not, but that happened to me and every friend of mine aside from one after our second doses."
16246,"Really strange experience though because it's not like you're actually sick, you just feel bad for a bit while your body goes through its immune response and then suddenly feel completely fine again."
16247,Happiest I've ever been with a fever tbh.
16248,Let’s get Ricky Bobby out there administering shots on the way in to all NASCAR events.
16249,"I'm hearing that a covid test is $100 us and a fake paper (fake negative test result) is only $10 us

That true?"
16250,Where do you get the fake papers?
16251,I agree with what you are saying.
16252,But I feel there are other factors at play here.
16253,India and UK have given AZ vaccine to millions of people without blood clots.
16254,This issue seems to be way more common in some countries.
16255,There have to be other factors- maybe common medicines or diet or some other factor in the people who are more prone to clots.
16256,"Just like deaths due to covid have been extremely high in the west due to obesity, age, etc factors."
16257,We will know later.
16258,Several countries will happily take the vaccine.
16259,"Lol, come on now."
16260,The people who actually feel that way are not the people that were on the fence.
16261,10% of those vaccinated won't get an infection.
16262,10% of those vaccinated people **who have an exposure that would cause an infection in an unvaccinated person** will get an infection.
16263,&gt;Masks will not be required in outdoor settings but will remain required indoors and on public transportation.
16264,"Along with full capacity with social distancing, these decisions never make sense."
16265,Businesses will still require masks and social distancing even if patrons have to present a vaccine passport or whatever.
16266,"By all means, I’m not trying to minimize."
16267,"Scrutinizing charts and metrics and forecasts is my day job, so forgive my nitpicking."
16268,Thanks for your service
16269,IDK why these websites say this!
16270,When I saw this I got a little confused but when I got my vaccine at Walgreens then didn't even ask for insurance.
16271,Why would anyone think it's free?
16272,"This is America, land of the unaffordable copay."
16273,True but not for too much longer.
16274,Few months at most.
16275,I find it funny that the comment was removed.
16276,Reddit is so left it’s scary.
16277,"Yes that's because if you have insurance the insurance company pays and if you don't, the government pays."
16278,Plus it's good to get the patient's info so they can add that they got the vaccine to their record.

16284,It's very difficult to determine the detailed pathophysiology of this phenomenon given how recent the findings are and no one can say for sure at this stage which comorbidies will cause someone to be at a greater risk.
16285,"There is some speculation that those that have factors which put them at risk of having hypercoagulable blood (such as women taking the pill) may put them at a slightly higher risk, but without the data to back this up, there's no way of saying for sure."
16286,Frankly it may take some time before we uncover a lot of the unknowns.
16287,"With regards to why it's  happening, it's likely that the involvement of a modified adenovirus being used as the vector for these vaccines is playing a large role in the process of VIPIT."
16288,"Thank you for sharing, that is amazing."
16289,"They ask for health insurance information when you register and I can imagine that being a real trigger for rejection, since it doesn't specify that it's free even if your insurance isn't covering it."
16290,"The same is true for flu vaccines, at least around here."
16291,"Again, page 12 shows that it is relative to other E484K variants."
16292,There is no indication in that report that B1.135 is growing at a faster rate relative to B.1.1.7.
16293,It's not a bonus.
16294,Herd immunity is the end goal.
16295,Herd immunity is only achieved if vaccinated people are not able to pass the virus on.
16296,If they're not protected against infection - no herd immunity is possible.
16297,They’re the same side effects but moderna just has slightly more frequent side effects after the second dose.
16298,"A lot of that might just be dose timing though, moderna is 4 instead of 3 weeks apart which means you have a stronger immune reaction from buildup after the first dose."
16299,Are you vaccinated

16309,Actually in my experience healthcare workers do not get tested at all.
16310,"At a medical center affiliated with a medical school, the medical school people get tested weekly, while the medical center people (you know, working WITH patients) get tested only if they are symptomatic."
16311,"No, no, that's a load of bullcrap."
16312,"Also, ""toughest"" my ass."
16313,They GOP controlled Michigan legislature literally sued and the conservative judges overturned all attempts by the Democratic governor's attempts to control the pandemic.
16314,"I guess, to someone like the people who stormed the Michigan capital with firearms and plotted to kidnap the governor and blockaded a hospital, ""no indoor dining"" and being asked to wear masks is ""draconian"", but we shouldn't be surprised Michigan is spiking when those assholes are probably going around licking doorknobs."

16319,&gt;Vaccine doses purchased with U.S. taxpayer dollars will be given to the  American people at no cost.
16320,"However, vaccination providers such as UConn  Health are able to charge an administration fee for giving the shot to  someone."
16321,"**Vaccine providers can get this fee reimbursed by the patient’s  public or private insurance company or, for uninsured patients, by the  Health Resources and Services Administration’s Provider Relief Fund."
16322,"**

16344,You're arguing how to propagandize.
16345,"However if you let the falsehood stand that vaccines don't protect against infection, then the argument that you should get vaccinated to protect other people will ring false."
16346,Herd immunity only happens because the vaccinated are no longer conduits for the virus to take from one unvaccinated person to another.
16347,What vaccine are they mainly using in the EU?
16348,"With the pause of AZ and J&amp;J, won’t things slow down?"
16349,"Like I said, it’s a literal miracle."

16354,The more arms it gets into the better.
16355,It’s so weird that California has dropped so drastically with their cases yet still has over 100+ deaths a day.
16356,As a female in her 30s who got the j&amp;j last week I don’t loveeeee this wait and see thing.
16357,I know the chances are incredibly small but I had just gotten a step ahead of covid anxiety and now I have this shiny new anxiety.
16358,Definitely depends where in the US you are

16363,USA has blocked export of vaccine raw materials.
16364,"Serum institute needs those materials to produce the vaccine and currently, they were importing from USA."

16378,"Same here, 19 years old, felt extremely ill for 24 hours (temp of 39 degrees c at one point), second jab booked in for may."
16379,Also no regrets :)
16380,And the 7-day average?
16381,"I think the trial here is to let your (not sure what you call it in English) personal doctor give you AZ, because he's closer to his patients (as in he could possibly predict the risks better) and it's easier for you to come back for check ups?"
16382,Bigger Vaccination Centers wont be using it as far as i know.
16383,I wish i could get ANY vaccine right now.
16384,So far you can count the people i met for personal reasons (apart from family and only that very rarely ) this year on one hand.
16385,I don't think any firm dates have been shared with the public.
16386,I'm hopeful it's about the same latency as the EUA applications these vaccines used in the past.
16387,&gt;The argument that the positive effects of vaccinating with AZ outweighs the risk of some people dying is being upvoted and parroted throughout the thread.
16388,"Which is a valid opinion to have, at least it can be thrown up for discussion."
16389,&gt; Yet the same people that are voicing this opinion likely ridiculed the  very same kind of thinking in relation to anti-lockdown rhetoric; that  the positive of keeping the economy going outweighs all the lives that  will be lost.
16390,"There is a massive difference between tens of thousands of lives lost per country on average (and multiple hundreds of thousands for the bigger ones like the US) due to COVID, and the single or double-digit number of people affected by the extremely rare side-effects of the AZ and J&amp;J vaccine, of whom the affected rate does not even necessarily correlate to an amount of deaths, as I believe some of the people who were affected by the J&amp;J vaccine did survive the ordeal."
16391,I understand what you're getting at but it's a bit disingenuous to lump all these people in the same category when there is such an obvious difference in the statistics present.
16392,"And I get it; if your opinion is that any life lost is one too many, then for sure we cannot go around risking people's lives with the very vaccine that's meant to save them."
16393,"Then again, how many people would have died of covid vs. the amount of people that would have died of the vaccine, should we delay or cancel it?"
16394,Those are the type of estimates that are hard to make.
16395,Those are the decisions that are even harder to make; because whose lives are going to be sacrificed regardless?
16396,"Someone who could have gotten a vaccine this week, or next week, but couldn't?"
16397,Or someone who will get the vaccine and die due to it?
16398,Both are terrible of course.
16399,But which ones are more likely to occur?

there is an additional percentage that is wavering on the line."

16410,"In the US, women were so often excluded from clinical trials that the US had to enact legislation requiring women participants in the 1980s."
16411,Following that was even more legislation in the 1990s when they discovered women were still being excluded.
16412,Sexism in medicine is an enormous issue and these vaccines have me reeling in anger at the negligence about its effects on women.
16413,I'm on day 16 of my period (got my vaccine 20 days ago).
16414,Every menstruating person I know had an irregular period starting between three and four days after getting the vaccine.

16427,Because ultimately pregnancy is a woman’s problem.
16428,"It is still used, as it has been historically, to ensure women experience the least amount of freedom possible."
16429,Dying from a blood clot caused by birth control is an acceptable risk for the medical community because that woman deserves what she gets for wanting to have sex while being protected from pregnancy.
16430,"It’s an acceptable risk, but yet another burden on women’s shoulders."
16431,Try getting your tubes tied.
16432,I have found it extremely difficult to get a reliable referral for this procedure (even though another pregnancy puts my life in danger) and have been pushed towards iud’s (which have their own complications).
16433,"The price is not 3rd world friendly at all, but at least it's available."

16457,A year from now peiple will look back at our masks obsession and all pretend they thought they were not very effective.
16458,Until then we will continue to our up with masks forever people claiming the data backs them up without ever looking at data.
16459,Also worth mentioning that it originally was considered to be *much* rarer than the 1/40k figure it is now.
16460,"It’s likely that, since they’re very similar in delivery method, even J&amp;J’s one-in-a-million number is likely to become higher over time."
16461,My mom lives on a third world country and she got that Chinese vaccine.
16462,She is happy because she didn't had any symptoms after the second dose.
16463,"I swear to God, if that shit is a placebo."
16464,It’s incredible how BC possible blood clotting isn’t discussed enough.
16465,"I have been nothing but healthy all my life (also active, no known risk factors, etc)."
16466,Half a year ago I began treatment for my adult cystic acne which included birth control and accutane.
16467,The dermatologist told me that I needed to take bc because of the adverse side effects of accutane on a fetus.
16468,(Note: this is my first time taking oral contraceptives).
16469,I told her it wasn’t necessary because I’m not sexually active and i didn’t plan on being either.
16470,She refuses to give me any medication without me accepting to take bc.
16471,"Cut to almost 6 months later and here I am, in the hospital, for a pulmonary embolism 😐"
16472,"👍good to hear, that's how it should be."
16473,"I haven't flown but have family who reported very different experiences on at least one flight (either on Alaska or Delta, not sure which)."
16474,Didn't Canada even sign up for COVAX.
16475,&gt; All you're doing is proving my point - viruses are hard and no two places are the same.
16476,Hm.
16477,Funny.
16478,I could say the same about you and the rest of the people who shrieked and lost their shit when those states lifted their mask mandates.

16481,The CDC just says 14 days for the 2 shot vaccines as to not confuse people.
16482,It is 14 days for Moderna and 7 days for Pfizer.
16483,Dumbest shit in the world.
16484,Imagine getting a huge bill two weeks after your car was stolen because the police officer who checked for prints was covering from a different town so your police insurance doesn’t cover it.
16485,"‘Sorry sir, your fire insurance only covers ladders up to 10’ high, the boys used a 12’ ladder to get your wife out the top floor so that’s an $8,000 deductible I’m afraid."
16486,Would you like to pay cash or card?’
16487,"Lots of people do not pay any attention at all to anything, unless they think they can get high or get laid."
16488,Some are stupid.
16489,Some are just uninformed.
16490,"Some are working 3 jobs and trying to raise a baby, and just don't have time to pay attention."
16491,"Yes, that's how you monitor and control outbreaks."
16492,"&gt;We don't have the exact numbers of how many young women received the J&amp;J, but it is actually possible that it carries more risk than COVID itself for that group, all while there are alternatives for it that don't."
16493,This was my comment.
16494,"Since then, the CDC announced numbers that are worse for COVID than the vaccine is for that demographic (though I'd like to see if they accounted for the 2-week delay in clotting compared to people who already took the vaccine)."
16495,"So we have more info since my comment, and it seems to mean that the vaccine is safer than COVID."
16496,"Of curse, since in some places like the United States there are alternatives, it still doesn't make sense to give it to young women."
16497,um...wasn't the whole point that it's a different kind of blood clots that does not respond effectively to known treatments and is more lethal?
16498,this comparison is less than worthless
16499,"It's not about the cost, it's about giving hope by giving an end date based off thresholds."
16500,What was the purpose of saying because the insurance companies know who your primary is?
16501,This is true.
16502,I work for a facility that administers the vaccine.
16503,The clinics are willing to participate because they are being reimbursed by the local government which was funded by the federal government.
16504,It's not possible to vaccinate 300 million Americans for free without putting clinics or pharmacies out of business.
16505,"If you have no insurance, they will ask for a driver's license number or social security."
16506,The documentation is forwarded to the government that will in turn reimburse the clinics.
16507,"I will take it, but the fact that this wasn't outed in clinical trials is whats concerning to me, we dont know how or why the blood clots are happening, we just know that they do."
16508,I wouldn't want to take something that I might be a a super high risk for just because we don't know what the risk factors are yet.
16509,"Maybe its 1 in a million for the gen pop, but 1 in 100 or less if you have a certain number of risk factors."
16510,"Already being young and female seems to be a risk, what about pregnancy?"
16511,What about preexisting conditions etc.
16512,What about other medications?
16513,It seems like the world is basically AZs clinical trial right now and I dont know if I want to sign up when there are other options out there 🤷‍♀️
16514,Well he’s also 80 and cases are still high in most places.
16515,"For himself, it probably isn’t worth the risk yet."
16516,Florida is one of the densest *states* in the country - have you heard of research?
16517,And why are you trying to refute MI with states that are less dense?
16518,All you're doing is proving my point - viruses are hard and no two places are the same.
16519,"If you think FL is an example of why everyone should open, then MI shouldn't be struggling."
16520,But they are.
16521,Badly.
16522,Using AR and MS as counterpoints to the counterpoints when they are even less dense is like a billboard for ignorance.
16523,"“Haha, last time I lost my livelihood, saw my dreams crumble in front of me, watched my Alzheimer’s riddled grandfather slowly lose his mind but not be able to visit him, see my young child not be able to learn to socialise with peers, with every touted end to this hell coming with a caveat, I was annoyed too.”

You have no idea how the pandemic has impacted the person you’re replying to."
16524,Just because you haven’t had a hard time doesn’t mean they haven’t.
16525,"Cost of infection for a 60-year-old (assuming no ongoing transmission) : ~$20,000

Cost of infection for a 20-year-old (assuming no ongoing transmission) : ~$100

Cost of wearing a mask you already own by now: $0

Cost of vaccination: ~$40"
16526,That's not really helpful when Covid is far more contagious.
16527,"I don't know why you people keep trotting out this talking point as if it somehow reduces the risk of dying from Covid, or even suffering severe effects."
16528,"The flu may kill more, but it's pretty easy to keep my son away from the flu."
16529,It's much more difficult to keep him away from Covid.
16530,We’ll know much more in the coming days!
16531,"Praise be to Astrazeneca, glory to Astrazeneca"
16532,"If you have insurance, they'll charge them the administration fee (which will not be passed on to you)."
16533,"If you don't have insurance, the federal government will cover you."
16534,"Either way, there's no cost to the person being vaccinated."
16535,"i like how you say ""aren't exposed"" versus ""don't look for"" -- like it's somehow the government's fault or the media's fault (?)"

16537,I think this experience is going to be used as an example in quite a few textbooks.
16538,"Intro to stats, intro to risk management, intro to public health..."
16539,"Makes sense, you goto the hospital you're going to get covid tested regardless of why you went."
16540,Isn’t there a study floating around that the J&amp;J gets to 90% efficacy after 50 days or something?
16541,Kennedy Center in DC is coming back fully in September.
16542,I can't freaking wait.

My best guess is that the last sentence makes your comment sound negative towards, at least, AZ vaccine."
16553,"For people that skim comments and basically read only the first or last sentence, you can see how that could be misinterpreted."
16554,"I personally disagree with the amount of negative coverage for AZ, and am interested in the latest J&amp;J developments, since both of those are being paused out of an ""*abundance of caution*""."
16555,"IMHO, they are way less dangerous than an average person percieves them to be, and my guess is that more people *might* die because of not vaccinating (because of fears/bad press/etc) than would if everyone in the world were to be vaccinated using AZ exclusively."
16556,"&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: People mad because they might percieve comment as negative toward vaccination."
16557,Doesn't that mean that said facilities are not at 100% capacity?
16558,You don't need a vaccine to be healthy.
16559,No worries.
16560,It's sounds like panic to me too.
16561,When you are anxious and experiencing panic you can hold on to muscle tension in some funny places.

16563,"I also get a sore throat and jaw pain from tension I hold in my mouth, neck and tongue."

16567,I’m not a scientist or a doctor so I don’t know specifically how our immune system differentiates between our own cells and foreign cells.
16568,I do know that our immune system can sometimes make mistakes and attack our own cells because it doesn’t recognize them.

16622,But what did insurance actually pay?
16623,The vaccine is covered and this is an administration fee.
16624,Seriously cant be that much as get a flu shot for 20 cash no insurance most places covering admin fee and the shot.
16625,Did he go through a doctors office or something.
16626,"Seriously doubt the insurance would cover that much, Your father still wouldn't pay but i do not see any insurance mass covering 180 a shot just to stick you."
16627,"Hospital, pharmacies, and all other medical clinics are paid to administer the vaccine."
16628,"That's why they are willing to participate, otherwise they would go out of business trying to vaccinate 300 million Americans."
16629,The facilities can not bill the patient but they can bill your insurance company.
16630,"If you don't have insurance, they will take some information down from you like a social security number or driver's license number and bill your local government because your local government has agreed to reimburse the facilities."

16719,Then more slots for the waitlists?
16720,Thank you.
16721,My parents got their first AstraZeneca dose last week.
16722,Hoping for the immunity to kick in soon.
16723,2nd dose would be somewhere in May.
16724,It won’t happen to everyone at once.
16725,Some people have had this attitude since the beginning.
16726,Others felt that way after recovering from COVID or getting vaxxed or seeing vaccines open to all adults or simply developing pandemic fatigue.
16727,"But every day, more people cross into this camp."
16728,Public health guidelines?
16729,I bet we’ll just see these fade into obscurity as the public stops caring.
16730,"They’ll be in place, but they won’t feel essential."
16731,"Unfortunately, that’s the consequence of having public health policy that’s been slow to pivot to harm reduction rather than full-on risk aversion."
16732,"This article is not about a clinical trial...

And yeah, the clinical trials werent challenge trials."
16733,"Literally everyone knows this, but that doesn't mean that they didn't have controls."
16734,"Depending on the trial, they do a shit ton of matching to control for all feasible variables."
16735,"I feel the challenge is to advertise beyond just telling people to get the vaccine, that we need to help and let people know who wants a vaccine that fact that you mentioned."
16736,What are your thoughts on perhaps a canvassing campaign and hammering that fact home?
16737,niikeels
16738,Yep.
16739,I have a long history with needles due to heart problems.
16740,"I'm used to them but if they have to ""fish"" for the vein even a little, I used to feel my vision closing in..."
16741,"I skimmed the article and it didn't seem to say how many of them were 2+ weeks out from their last shot, when the vaccination is supposedly highest strength."
16742,"Playing devil's advocate, because they aren't sure that it only affects women in that age group."
16743,These 6 people were all in that group but how do we know that was not just chance?
16744,There was a report of one male developing blood clots during the trials which is a data point suggesting that it isn't just women.
16745,"A great and terrible example of how one person (Bolsonaro) *can* make a difference in the world... good or bad, and in this case, bad."
16746,"If it helps, I was completely prepared to feel super ill after Pfizer dose 2, and instead, I feel completely fine."
16747,My bicep is a bit sore when I move it.
16748,That's all.
16749,"So, before we go any further I want to say that I agree with you."
16750,"Right now it is too early to be dropping masks (but, not too early to be setting the groundwork - I.e., one month after every adult is eligible for a shot, which should be a month and a half from now)."
16751,"With that said, this is Reddit and I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t enjoy the debate."
16752,"The same people who are saying, “it’s too early, give it *just* another month or two”, will be saying the same thing in 2 months."
16753,These people are extremely risk averse individuals and believe that masks should only be walked back once there is virtually 0 risk of infection in the community.
16754,That will *never* be the case.
16755,My suggestion?
16756,"Pick a date, and stick to it."
16757,"June 15th, I don’t know."
16758,"Far enough away that it appeases the overly risk averse, but it must be stuck to."
16759,"Regardless what happens, on June 15th, masks are no longer mandates, no more social distancing, 100% capacity everywhere."
16760,"Covid is over, June 15th."
16761,Or something like that.
16762,Sorry but no.
16763,"I’ve spent over a year being “very worried” and now that I’m going to be fully vaccinated in a few weeks I’m not spending any more of my prime years being worried about this, I’m going to live my life."
16764,"Yes, I’m going to wear a mask in public for however long it’s required but I’m not going to put off seeing my also fully vaccinated friends and family or worrying about what other people do anymore."
16765,"can confirm, it was not just the pandemic but also political issues before (estallido social) and the help from the government has been very sparse, people it's quite desesperated to work because they just don't have money and my own family last year was living trough this reality, it was total hell."
16766,If it wasn't by the fact I got an online job and hop back to get a salary I wouldn't know what would have happened to us because we didn't had to eat and the government wasn't giving us any help and in fact after that people was almost obligated to work because almost all the service jobs are downtown and it wasn't like it was a pandemic a few months ago.
16767,"Chile has been holding on so much, we're done with politicians, with security because nowadays lots of people are not working and we even have a coup to respect also and the whole ""plan paso a paso"" (step by step plan) of putting some counties to work and not others even considering we're next to each other lol it was a complete MESS."
16768,&gt;Why do they think it was COVID and not his protein S deficiency?
16769,because they get to bill the government more.
16770,Hard to find credible data.
16771,My work data shows 2k deaths reported in 20-29 y.o.
16772,and 2019 us census shows age 24 - 34 has 46 million people.
16773,So 1 in 25k 20-29 y.o.
16774,will die from COVID.
16775,Quick math as I am partially combining two age groups for the denominator.
16776,J&amp;J would still benefit this group but does carry a higher risk profile.
16777,She didn't do everything perfectly because she hardly did anything at all - after a super solid start into the pandemic last spring.
16778,It's probably his second time.
16779,The first time he was asymptomatic and spread to a few thousand people.
16780,What if there is an air current that prevents the virus from landing on a surface for longer than 3 hours?
16781,At what point does the virus die/become non-viable while remaining airborne?
16782,"I mean looking at the data dispassionately, what they are doing does make sense."
16783,Someone died unexpectedly and statistically the number of blood clots is an outlier.
16784,"If this all happened in the past few weeks and it might take longer for blood clots to occur in other people, then it makes sense to pause and watch for a while longer to see."
16785,"If they do establish a causal relationship between the vaccine the blood clots but it is very rare say 1 in a million, they will have a dilemma."
16786,"Statistically it is still far better for people to get vaccinated, but it will be hard to sell a vaccine that has even a 1 in a million chance of killing you, when you intend on giving it to hundreds of millions of people."
16787,Wow.
16788,How awful.
16789,Yeah you're spot on.
16790,There is anyways a normal assumption that vaccines are given to healthy people.
16791,That's why there is a lot of caution on any side effects.
16792,"Unfortunately, it seems to me that a lot of people, and Americans in particular, have completely flipped their perspective now that vaccines are out."
16793,Before everyone was saying to trust science.
16794,Now they only want to see results and studies that support certain rhetoric.
16795,Anything mildly scientific about the risk of vaccine side effects needs to be dismissed immediately on whatever basis they can find because of some kind of culture war in their society.
16796,They are going to another country in EU
16797,Is it just me or does it seem like it's a race between Brazil and the US to see which country can fuck things up the most for themselves and the entire world?
16798,"Can't say too much, Canada is NOT doing well with getting the vaccine(s) out and too many people are really starting to fuck things up for the rest of us here, too."
16799,:(
16800,"&gt; Of course the situation in ICUs is worsening, as the case tally was growing fast until a few days ago (and it's still growing although not as fast)."
16801,Hm?
16802,"We have a +46% increase in comparison to last week, ~30,000 new infections today."
16803,Do they know why AstraZeneca is causing clots yet?
16804,I see a lot of countries restricting it to over 60’s.
16805,"Risk of actually getting COVID and dying from it, for somebody in my demographic, factoring in age, fitness, and general health: 0.000001%

I think I'll take my chances."
16806,It's not so much what risk does covid-19 to yourself and more what risk is there from you catching covid-19 and then spreading to others who might be more vulnerable.
16807,The way to stop a Pandemic is to limit the virus's ability to spread.
16808,That is why just vaccinating those who are vulnerable isn't anywhere near enough.
16809,"The other point that I found during this Pandemic is that many people are obsessed with risk of death, there is much more to consider."
16810,Yes the risk of death might be so small that its not a consideration but what are the long term effects of having covid-19?
16811,"We know that many people have and area still suffering from long covid-19, we know that covid-19 can cause organ damage even in fit and healthy people."
16812,So it's not just as simple as will covid-19 kill me.
16813,"CSU incoming... (I hope not, but I fear the worst)"
16814,"&gt; the vaccine which is a one-time risk

I don't know about that."
16815,It's looking more like the covid vaccine will become an annual or bi-annual vaccine (like the flu shot).
16816,"Now, we could also say that if you've had the vaccine before and did not present side effects, than your risk of presenting side effects with future vaccinations is very small."
16817,"However, you could possibly say the same with covid."
16818,Are you symptoms/risks with covid the same every time you get it?
16819,"So, here's what I would say."
16820,"Get the vaccination because A. the risks are smaller, but also B."
16821,It's in a controlled environment where scientists can continue to improve the formula.
16822,Covid is unpredictable because of variants in the wild.
16823,Astrazeneca?

16844,I wouldn’t say that.
16845,"Rural areas are dominated by older people, the group that has performed amazingly when it comes to getting vaccinated."
16846,I think the problem will be the cities where young people don’t get vaccinated because they can’t be bothered.
16847,I think voting is a good thing to compare it to.
16848,"If you can’t be bothered to get off your butt and vote (young people), then you likely aren’t going to get off your butt and get vaccinated either."
16849,"they probably did this already but is it possible he already had COVID-19 and may have cardiomyopathy, its a known long-term effect of natural infection."
16850,This probably was brought to light with a strong immune response to the vaccine causing heart attack like symptoms.
16851,I know!
16852,I get so tired of hearing “it was only 6 out of 7 million people”.
16853,Yes sure if you include all ages and genders.
16854,"While still small, that number gets larger once you narrow down on the high risk group."
16855,"So if covid can cause it,than the vaccine, which contains part of the virus is causing it because of the virus."
16856,Maybe it's an allergic reaction?
16857,"If this is confirmed, you ofc would right."
16858,"So far, we dont know that."
16859,Depends on the sub I suppose.
16860,🤷‍♂️
16861,I promise I'm leaving this sub the moment I hit 2 weeks after my second shot.
16862,Just like to stay in the loop.
16863,This morning I went to the gym.
16864,It's been 3+ weeks after my first Pfizer shot.
16865,I got my second shot on Monday.
16866,"I was going to wait until at least next Monday, but after reading the studies on the first Pfizer shot's effectiveness, I decided to take the plunge."
16867,I'd be lying if I said I didn't have second thoughts on the drive over there.
16868,"Until I hit my 2 weeks post second shot, I think I'm always gonna be a little nervous."
16869,Even after... this whole virus has messed with a lot of people's psyche.
16870,"If you have kids going off to college, may be worth swaying them into becoming therapists."
16871,Gonna be a great profession for the next few years...
16872,The moment I got there and started lifting...
16873,I was a new person.
16874,"Almost everyone had their mask on, wiped down machines—which, whether COVID spreads on surfaces or not, it's a nice change—and I just feel better."
16875,"I've slowly gone back to normal - weekend road trips, seeing friends, etc... but this felt like a major step."
16876,Good to have some return to normalcy.
16877,&gt; you have to factor in both the risk of COVID causing a blood clot and the risk of getting COVID in the first place.
16878,You also have to factor in *every other person down the line* who could catch covid-19 from you or from someone who caught it from you.
16879,"By not getting infected yourself, you might save a thousand other people from getting infected."
16880,"&gt;”If I were talking to someone in Oklahoma, I would tell him or her to be very worried about it,"" Nicolelis told Bojorquez."
16881,"""Because if Brazil is out of control, the world will be out of control in a few weeks."
16882,"Because variants that are brewing here every day, every week… they will escape."""
16883,"The vaccine risk is 2 times and then probably one time per year, or would be, but you really don’t need to look longer than 2021, because as soon as Moderna, CureVac and Biontech/Pfizer (and maybe Novavax) have a steady production, nobody is going to use AZ anymore."
16884,"So you‘re definitely not calculating a lifetime risk of covid, just the 2021 risk of getting it."
16885,Why do they think it was COVID and not his protein S deficiency?
16886,You libertarians think you're so smart with this shit when you just come off as smug dipshits.
16887,These are pretty typical side effect symptoms.
16888,"...but your risk of dying from COVID is much higher than your risk of getting blood clots from the vaccine, regardless of who you are."

16904,I guess Haemorrhoids are just inflamed anal thrombosis?

16986,I get itll slow vaccine roll out but this is ridiculous.
16987,Why force and shame people to get a vaccine that has an unnecessary risk?
16988,Give it to a low risk demographic and give mrna to the risk group.

16995,I fully agree with first part.
16996,"Wow, it blows my mind it’s that slow for you guys."
16997,We have more people in CA than you do in your entire country.
16998,Hoping it speeds up for y’all!
16999,"I agree with you but guess what, that’s how birth control pills got approved by FDA, because they ONLY have 1/3-1/5 of blood clot risk compared to actual pregnancy."
17000,They’ve begun that: the CDC says fully vaccinated people can hang inside without any masks.
17001,:D I’m gonna get to hug my grandparents again!
17002,The problem is the 1 person in any household or school who _doesn’t see the point_ in getting the vaccine and by breaking their social contract then makes it less effective/safe for everyone by keeping the same risk of catching/spreading COVID/ it’s most contagious strains like b117 for which _some_ vaccines stand up against preventing a/symptomatic infection but others don’t.
17003,"Eventually the masks will go away, but not anytime too soon."
17004,People also are getting lazier with handwashing already which makes it easier for more variants to develop due to COVID’s nature
17005,Most estimates of infections converge to 3/10 in US have been infected
17006,Real Americans don't worry about shit.
17007,Bring it on.
17008,"Another question is, what is even causing the blood clot issue?"
17009,Is it possible people who have a vaccine complication would have an even worse situation with actual covid?
17010,Maybe maybe not but it is something to consider.
17011,I didn't.
17012,Thanks for the info.
17013,We already have perfectly safe vaccines with the moderna and the pfizer/biontech products and in a year there will be no problems because nobody is going to use AZ or J&amp;J anymore (the EU already said they won’t prolong the contract).
17014,"The choice here is not „I hate vaccines and don’t want any“, but „I want a safe vaccine like the ones that are already on the market.“"
17015,Exactly.
17016,Won't we all get covid eventually?
17017,I haven't heard any talk about eradicating the virus.
17018,"It's just a matter of time, and bring vaccinated will hopefully make it less severe when it happens."
17019,[removed]
17020,It is!
17021,But you only get 2 hours for that.
17022,DIdn't know it was free but got it anyways.
17023,To be fair the EMA have been very supportive of the vaccine.
17024,The whole argument is that the US does not export any vaccine at all.
17025,Zero.
17026,Which is why there literally is nothing to bid for in the first place.
17027,This is not about jumping the line.
17028,The fairest process would have been a common procurement scheme where everyone pays the same price and you allocate according to population (this is what the EU does internally).
17029,This gives smaller and / or  poorer nations equal access while keeping prices fair for everyone.
17030,"Instead we got various nations seizing their local production or skipping the line by throwing money at the problem, which fucks over smaller nations that dont have independent vaccine production for the particular vaccines that proved successful and it also fucks over poorer nations because throwing money at Pfizer to secure allocations simply inflates the price without leading to more production."
17031,That’s what I hear in that case.
17032,Second is acting to the protein spike and training your body got from the first.
17033,But if you had Covid/antibodies already.
17034,Then it would make sense your body would act like that from shot one.
17035,It’s already been detected.
17036,Shot 2 then should be a bit easier hopefully.
17037,All things considered I think the CO leadership has nailed timing on all things.
17038,They shut down a little before it was popular and then opened up 100% a little before it was popular.
17039,That's the sweet spot to be honest.
17040,We are past the stage when hospitals can get overrun.
17041,"There aren't enough high risk bodies without immunity to get there (especially with a furious pace of vaccinations)

If you are unvaccinated or uncomfortable with the risk, you should be making choices to keep yourself safe."
17042,"if you are comfortable with the risks, you should be allowed to do as you please."
17043,We are at the personal responsibility stage of this.
17044,"I had to share this news here because on Brazilian media there are already reports of intubated patients not being able to keep sedated and having to stay awake with the intubation equipment, which definetely is an inhuman treatment."
17045,"It's a tragedy that patients have to go through this to try to survive, that doctors have to submit patients to this."
17046,"I'm frustrated, angry, and can't express how revolting this situation is and many deaths and suffering could be avoided if the pandemic was taken seriously by the authorities, specially the federal government."
17047,Good point.
17048,"There are likely many, many other factors."
17049,"Maybe higher infectious doses received lead to more breakthrough cases AND make it deadlier, for instance."
17050,We could go on and on.
17051,"Well in the short term, being eligible doesn't mean everyone had had a chance to get the vaccine and enough time for immunity to develop."
17052,"There are still a potential 80 million people who may want the vaccine, at 1.6M first shots a day that would be 50 days."
17053,"And then you allow for time for immunity to develop, around 65 days."
17054,This is based upon the current average human's behavior.
17055,One can effectively lower their risk of COVID infection to 0.
17056,Full stop.
17057,So the choice isn't some nonzero chance of coivd infection vs vaccine risk with AZ or J&amp;J.
17058,Those are two of a myriad of options available including an effectively 0 chance of covid via hard personal lockdown for a period of time until there is an opportunity to get one of the mRNA vaccines.
17059,Not all options are available or feasible for everyone to be sure but the options aren't limited to riskier vaccine vs. escalating risk of COVID for everyone either.
17060,"You know what *I*, as a Data Scientist who makes a living assessing risk find funny - is people who are extremely selective with the **data** they cite in order to make their pre determined argument."
17061,"If we were truly making data driven decisions about risk, we would be seeing the following policies: 

1) fully vaccinated people can do whatever they want."
17062,"No masks, no distancing, nothing."
17063,There is growing scientific consensus that says vaccinated persons do not contract or spread covid (the likelihood is extremely small).
17064,2) Once everyone over 35 has been vaccinated - full return to normal.
17065,"According to this study, even with the new variants, people under 35 have a lower risk of dying from covid-19 than they do dying on the roads in a given year."
17066,"Based on CFR as well (page 7), which we know is an upper bound."
17067,"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03426-1_reference.pdf


&gt;Doing it cautiously and backed by data is how the overall approach is going."
17068,Not feelings.
17069,Cautiously?
17070,Yes.
17071,Backed by data?
17072,"I think it’s too early to tell, until *actual* policy recommendations come out that match the actual data bases risk insights."
17073,"**In fairness**, the actual recommendations from the CDC are *very* different from the messaging coming from the CDC director, Fauci, and the executive branch of government."
17074,"The CDC recommendations are very much in line with point 1 - vaccinated individuals do not contract or spread covid, but the messaging from the figure heads is very very different."
17075,"Unfortunately, you can still get Covid after you are vaccinated."
17076,CDC has been investigating a lot of breakthrough cases.
17077,https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/14/health/breakthrough-infections-covid-vaccines-cdc/index.html
17078,Everyone is drawing that conclusion because it's so damn obvious.
17079,The numbers aren't even close to equal if you compare the worst blood clot estimate with the most optimistic Covid estimate.
17080,The mistake many people here are making is brining it down to the individual level which is nonsensical.
17081,*Maybe* your odds of getting Covid are rare and maybe you won't suffer major consequences of you do just like you are exceedingly unlikely to get a blood clot.
17082,But because both numbers are small they are hard to comprehend.
17083,Scale it out and I don't even understand why this argument keeps coming up.
17084,Does it matter if it's 10 blood clots against 8000 or 20 against 4000?
17085,"Bring it to Brazil, we need to reduce transmission here to avoid new variants and also reduce ICU cases and deaths while we wait for vaccines."
17086,We're a big country..
17087,I never heard anyone talking about iver saying don't get the vaccine.
17088,"And if anyone did say that I'd say they're lunatics because of what they said about the vaccine, not about the other."
17089,"I never heard anything about 10x the normal dose, but I didn't look into it much."
17090,Oh yeah this is going to be bad.
17091,Do mid-23rd century transporters have biofilters?
17092,That's fair.
17093,"You should definitely follow your doctor's advice above anything you read online, lol."
17094,&gt; With other vaccine options I do not see why the AZ cannot be for low risk group with mrna being prioritized for the high risk clot groups.
17095,"If you read the article, it says that the risk of clots with AZ is 5 per million while the risk with Pfizer and Moderna is 4 per million."
17096,"With such small numbers of occurrences that's practically no difference, and second that's much, much less chance of something bad happening if you catch Covid (whether that's a clot or something else)."
17097,"Not to be a consipracist but from my perspective it's always seemed that the malice against AZ was more politics, profiit and clickbait than serious medical concern."
17098,Please try not to buy into this weird hype about AZ being 'dangerous' when it clearly isn't any more dangerous either than other vaccines or than medications that people guzzle without thinking every single day.
17099,I sent her this article so she feels better about it now.
17100,She qualifies this weekend so hoping she can find an appt soon.
17101,Those decisions are made in medicine all the time.
17102,Every drug has some side effect and doctors will determine whether to prescribe if the benefits outweigh the risks.
17103,Like a person who has the risk of stroke being prescribed a blood thinner that has some risk of internal bleeding.
17104,well this is a UK article and they seem to have access to moderna which is like Pfizer’s.
17105,Have they actually PROVEN that the other vaccines such as Pfizer don't cause these brain clots though.
17106,Has it been studied to the same level of astrazeneca?
17107,Free?
17108,Whose paying for their funeral?
17109,&gt;Why are we pausing vaccines again?
17110,"Would you feel comfortable if **you**, your family member or loved ones, or anyone else that you know and love were that 4 in 1mil, 5 in 1mil ?"
17111,"My answer is no, I see strokes and blood clots nearly every week."
17112,"They are severely debilitating and these folks need assistance with literally everything for the rest of their lives, wiping their ass, feeding themselves, speaking, drinking... everything."
17113,Which is why I understand that they are pausing over safety and efficacy concerns.
17114,"With J&amp;J in particular, the case studies have shown that the vaccine is already below 70% effective at preventing severe covid and hospitalizations, which means that you are still moderately susceptible to getting covid and thus getting a blood clot at a rate of 40 per million PLUS the 5 per million if you are getting the AZ or J&amp;J vaccine."
17115,Couldn’t agree more with Polish government.
17116,U.S can justify delaying J&amp;J as Pfizer/Moderna are the work horse but other countries without alternatives can justify continuing with it too
17117,"FYI, the vaccines largely do prevent infection altogether."
17118,"Not 100%, but studies are coming out pegging it around 90-95% or so."
17119,Oh you think you’re vaccine is gonna last forever?
17120,One time shot?
17121,Cured of covid?
17122,You got a source for that?
17123,With the whole blood clot issues it’s a lot now in Europe and much higher in Europe that don’t want to take it now vs the U.S.
17124,I don't understand your comment.
17125,"You said ""Real world settings are unlikely to have airborne spread"" and ended with ""Surface transmission is very rare."""
17126,Can you please clarify?
17127,Those two statements sound contradictory to each other.
17128,"Well Dr. Miguel Nicolelis, is indirectly telling you that you are not fully protected even though you are “fully vaccinated”."
17129,"Nobody here is saying to “panic” but,  don’t go around thinking you are something you actually aren’t."
17130,That wouldn’t categorize you as being “very worried” just “very uninformed.”
17131,I saw a random political survey yesterday and 6% of people had never heard of Mitch McConnell so 7% seems about right for people who 0 attention to the news
17132,"Well, getting the jab to a person's arm requires both the development, testing and manufacture of the vaccine."
17133,One without the other is useless.
17134,"I think the only question here is that if the US or some other government paid for the development, then they should get the vaccine at cost, but for everyone else, I don't think there's any particular reason that the profits shouldn't go to Pfizer."
17135,There would have been way less wealth transferred to billionaires.
17136,"Chlorine dioxide was big problem in my country a few months ago, especially after a anti-science reporter recommended it and pretended to drink some on live tv (before that they were a lot of facebook posts recommending it and they fake story of village in Bolivia with zero cases because apparently everyone drank it)."
17137,"There were a lot of cases of poisoning, including the death of a 10 year old kids whose parents gave him a lot of it after he started developing covid like symptoms."
17138,"Sadly, the only solution was to completely prohibit the sale of this product for a while, even for the approved industrial uses."
17139,"That’s true, but early reports are looking like if you don’t develop VIPIT with your first dose of a viral vector vaccine, you’re probably in the clear."
17140,Taken with a grain of salt though because pretty data on pretty much all of this stuff is too early to tell.
17141,Agreed 100%.
17142,"Acknowledge that there may be a very rare reaction, and the cause is being investigated."
17143,So far it seems to be young adult women affected so maybe restrict vaccination to that group.
17144,"However, to pause it entirely when it appears the absolute worst case scenario is 1 death per 3.5 million people is just fucking stupid and reactionary."
17145,It's simply been done to appease a group of anti-vax that would have never gotten the vaccine to begin with.
17146,If every single American was forced to get the J&amp;J shot about 100 people would die.
17147,But in a month we'd be down to zero covid deaths.
17148,Likely zero cases of severe illness and long haulers.
17149,We'd be fucking done with this.
17150,Also what about people that had covid?
17151,Should they not vaccinate?
17152,I got my first dose!
17153,"Thought for sure if walk outta there paying like $20 (which would've been perfectly fine), but it was free!"
17154,That's even better than $20.
17155,Go socialism!
17156,I think it's a bit more complicated than that.
17157,"There's legitimate reasons to be worried because while yes, the chances of developing blood clots is very low, we have absolutely no idea what causes a person to be susceptible to blood clots following a Covid infection or vaccination."
17158,How would you know if you might find yourself to be that 1 in a million person?
17159,"Then you have 2 other perfectly valid vaccines, Moderna and Pfizer, which have yet to lead to any reported cases of blood clots."
17160,"Can you really blame people for thinking ""Why would I get AstraZeneca or J&amp;J, which has a small probability of killing me, when I could get Moderna or Pfizer which does not have this potential side effect?"""
17161,"I'd be a different story if we knew what made people susceptible to blood clots in this case, because then people or their doctor could determine whether it is complete safe or not for them to get AstraZeneca or J&amp;J."
17162,"Well COVID can definitively lead to strokes/clotting, there's no doubt about it."
17163,"But protein S deficiency can also be a genetic condition, which I assumed is what OP was referring to since she described it as ""very rare""."
17164,Uk was doing 3 months apart.
17165,Canada is doing 4 months.
17166,Delaying is fine.
17167,Stop exaggerating what I said.
17168,It’s premature to say masks can’t be required in September.
17169,I would think maybe more?
17170,That’s taking into account people still taking precautions like masks and social distancing activities.
17171,"Once a big amount of the population is vaccinated (even if not full herd immunity yet) people are going to not follow precautions anymore, so the unvaccinated population and part of the vaccinated population will have very high probability of get infected as covid and its new variants are more contagious than the flu."
17172,So lifetime probability would be high specially if the natural immunity doesn’t last a lifetime
17173,I think saying the papers are just making up excuses for using their vaccines is a massive oversimplification.
17174,"There are multiple things at play here, but let's split it into two chunks:

1."
17175,What is the harm/benefit trade-off for the AZ vaccine across particular groups of the population?
17176,2.
17177,Should an individual who has had the AZ vaccine be worried?
17178,The first brings into play the risk of serious harm from covid vs the risk of harm from the vaccine when viewed in the aggregate across millions of people.
17179,In a number of countries it has been concluded that this analysis means there are different alternatives which may be better suited for these groups.
17180,"On the other hand, the second question is about the absolute risk of an individual to suffer serious harm from the vaccine, eg one of these blood clots."
17181,"In this case, you may want to compare this risk to other potentially fatal risks that you experience (and probably ignore) in everyday life to give perspective on the chance of this happening to you."
17182,"Both of these are valid analysis, and they are not at all mutually exclusive: a person under 30 (or wherever you want to draw the line) might be better off getting a different jab, but at the same, they probably shouldn't be overly anxious about developing this rare type of blood clot if they get a dose of AZ."
17183,"Your comment has been removed because

17192,It’s just you.
17193,The rest of us are aware that the US had an administration change in January.
17194,Agreed.
17195,As you open up the same size in a real world environment you will see more outliers notionally.
17196,The question is whether this is expected or unexpected (the 74 deaths / 5800 cases).
17197,I don’t think (based on this article) the cdc is ready to make that determination.
17198,As the # vaccinated is now a constantly moving target I think further data will help understand the efficiacy of the vaccines against severe covid and deaths even better.
17199,The point you're missing is that we're sick of living our lives inside of four walls.
17200,I've been cooped up for 56 weeks now with my wife and three children ranging from high school to first grade.
17201,"Our oldest has basically been in full revolt for months, borderline hating us for not letting her give up on the whole thing and run around with her boyfriend and friends who all think this is a hoax."
17202,"The middle schooler is a bit more understanding, but equally frustrated and just hates the world."
17203,"The little just hates everything and doesn't know where to direct it, so it gets directed everywhere."
17204,The vaccine is the light at the end of the tunnel.
17205,"Risking COVID was not an option for me--I have asthma and decreased lung function because of a nasty respiratory infection last January (no, I don't know if it was COVID, nor do I know that it was not, but it WRECKED me)."
17206,"I'll take the astronomically low chance of a blood clot over another year of this, or even another three months of this."
17207,Chris Cuomo straight up laughed at Bernie at the last debate when Bernie mentioned the need for m4a &amp; it addressing the issue of the mental health effects of us dealing with this virus
17208,"Oh yes, they’re available, and some Moderna, too, but unless you’re a woman under 30 you can’t choose—you get whatever it is they happen to be offering at your appointment time."
17209,This only compares brain blood clots.
17210,"If there are clots in the brain, there’s likely clots elsewhere."
17211,Day 10 after the J&amp;J shot.
17212,I'm so close to the finish line
17213,Can someone explain to me why masks and restrictions need to remain in place even after the vaccine is available to everyone?
17214,"On April 19,  the vaccine will be available to everyone over 16 years old."
17215,Why then does our governor say he doesn’t see masks or restrictions or capacity limits being changed even after Memorial Day?
17216,I don’t fucking get it.
17217,Why am I covering my face because idiots don’t want to get the shot??
17218,"Cases are down, deaths are down, transmission rate is down."
17219,What gives??
17220,This is getting so so old.
17221,"Yes, but you can try to not get covid!"
17222,Or a safer vaccine!!
17223,!
17224,You got a source for your six month claim?
17225,Sure but they had two equally sized groups monitored over the same time period which gets you much closer to measuring similar levels of exposure with a big enough group.
17226,The problem is if you try to compare the percent vaccinated who got covid to the unvaccinated group there is not one singular timeline and one group is much larger because people didn’t all get vaccinated at the same time.
17227,Makes the math very tricky.
17228,Yep.
17229,Somebody's gotta print the money.
17230,&gt;Nobody would voluntarily infect themselves with Covid.
17231,Not sure I agree here.
17232,There are none.

17243,This is such a dishonest hastily prepared study
17244,Did you miss when the CDC and Fauci were telling us masks didn’t work a year ago?
17245,"I believe in masking, but we were lied to by authorities originally, so is it any wonder why people are like this now?"
17246,Hilarious how quickly the “trust science!” crowd immediately stops doing so the second “science” does something they disagree with!
17247,The places where people actually live still have local mandates.
17248,"Texas tried suing them to stop but failed, so there's a possibility that the low numbers out of there are still partially due to mask mandates."
17249,1 week out from my second shot and I can’t wait till I can get back to the gym.
17250,“Quarantine” did a number on my physical appearance lol
17251,"the likely cause has been identified ""Vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCov-19 can result in the rare development of immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia mediated by platelet-activating antibodies against PF4, which clinically mimics autoimmune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia."""
17252,&gt; It may be something closer to like a 30-40% lifetime risk of infection depending how the pandemic plays out and how old you are.
17253,Or a 2-3% chance in the couple of months you wait for a different vaccine.
17254,Surely it's not a question of one or the other?
17255,This is a partnership between public and private enterprise that was obviously successful.
17256,"People make informed decisions about daily choices and medicine everyday, medications have to disclose what they can cause even as rare probability, then people decide if it is worth the risk or not."
17257,"Some medication has a lot higher probability of blood clot but patient usually are dealing with much more complex symptoms or diseases and decide if it is worth the risk or not, also patients are told to keep an eye for clots and are usually being seen by a dr for regular updates."
17258,Things like taking plane rides does have a small chance but again people has knowledge and decide the risk.
17259,Why would people not be told the risks for AZ vaccine?
17260,They have to be told and be on look out for symptoms.
17261,It is a bit ridiculous to demand people take a medication to benefit someone else when they do not feel the risk outweighs the benefit.
17262,If the population in your country does not feel it is worth the risk who can force them to take?
17263,"Show them the pros and cons, who which group is more susceptible, don’t just say: you have risk of clotting with covid too."
17264,"A lot of people have not and will not get covid, but ignoring the issues with the vaccine will not help anyone."
17265,That is horrible!
17266,But...*Wait.
17267,"* I did a search that brought me to the following website: https://www.delcopa.gov/covid/index.html  Please spread the word that vaccinations can be signed up for there, and that vaccination sites are posted there."

17272,My parents live cross country and last time they came to see me they splurged bought business class tickets so they didn’t have to sit with someone else in their row.
17273,"I don’t blame you for buying an extra seat, it sucks spending that extra money but it’s better than getting Covid."
17274,"If the risk of death not just CVT is 1/1,000,000 and you vaccinate all 330,000,000 people in the US  you would expect 330 deaths from vaccines."
17275,"Almost 600,000 people have died of COVID, not counting the millions that will suffer irreversible heart and lung damage."
17276,"Yeah, we should definitely pause JJ and AZ."
17277,Makes total sense.
17278,With that in mind is there a more accurate estimate of immunity level in the US?
17279,"Yes, I understand that and like I said I will continue to wear a mask in public because not everyone is able to get vaccinated at this point."
17280,But in my personal life everyone I will be coming in close contact with us already or will soon be fully vaccinated.
17281,And?
17282,Build a better vaccine.
17283,"Most commonly reported side effects, from the research trials:

[Pfizer](https://www.fda.gov/media/144245/download)

* Injection site reaction - 84.1%
* Fatigue- 62.9%
* Headache- 55.1%
* Muscle pain- 38.3%
* Chills- 31.9%
* Joint pain- 23.6%
* Fever- 14.2

* Fatigue- 68.5%
* Headache- 63%
* Muscle pain- 59.6%
* Joint pain- 44.8%
* Chills 43.4%"
17284,Someone I know had two Pfizers in the UK
17285,"The damage is done, no one will want JJ or astra and will like go for other two."
17286,That's the important one.
17287,"Because everyone will eventually get infected, this virus is here to stay."
17288,"However, it will take months/years for that and there will be plenty vaccines other than AZ available during that time frame."
17289,"On the other hand, I would still take it if I could get an appointment tomorrow."
17290,"I guess we’ll see, the super rich haven’t exactly done the right thing man, Panama papers among other things slowly tilted me into realizing that we are peasants lol"
17291,Very concerning.
17292,Everyone in my immediate family now has at least one shot!
17293,4 Pfizer and 1 Moderna.
17294,I know it’s anecdotal but I really think we’re starting to turn a corner here.
17295,Minnesota is starting to sail too.
17296,"That's a one-off figure I guess, it's so higher than the other ones."
17297,I suspect there's a bit of a backlog.
17298,I’ve been at my neighborhood gym this whole time and I wish I could hug every single person who didn’t have organized physical fitness as an outlet for the last year.
17299,I wouldn’t have made it.
17300,"Oh you don't think I know that, but that's an entirely different issue"
17301,Keep in mind that people under sixteen can't be vaccinated yet.
17302,"Young people are very unlikely to die or go on a ventilator, but young people are known to develop long covid and other long term symptoms."
17303,"There are also immunocompromised people who can't be vaccinated, or can't form a robust immune response."
17304,"We are rapidly approaching the point where any adult who chooses to get vaccinated can, and I'm not going to lose any sleep over the consequences of the choices of vaccine skeptics."
17305,But we do need to be somewhat concerned about children.
17306,"As long as every patient knows what to expect, that's OK."
17307,I don't like that some countries stop vaccinating with certain vaccines entirely.
17308,"IMO, everyone should be allowed to weigh the risks for themselves and get the shot if they want."
17309,I would feel more safe if I could go to the next vaccination center and get my jab.
17310,And I strongly believe I am not the only one.
17311,"But instead, the J&amp;J vaccination is stopped entirely in Germany while the risks are being evaluated."
17312,"Heck, I would even jump into my car and head for the barracks where the doses are currently stored (about 50 miles from where I live, instead of 5 miles to the next vaccination center), if I could get my f\*\*\*ing shot that way."
17313,Americans are fucking dumb
17314,&gt;Did government really think that people were not going to socialize?
17315,"to be fair, Trump was an anti-social president."
17316,Things are different now that Biden has taken the role.
17317,This is excellent.
17318,Thank you for sharing.
17319,Those who thought this was a podcast or something should have a read.
17320,Agree which is why im being extra safe and havent left my house in like a year minus one month of school labs.
17321,I would never subject myself to the adenovirus vaccine as well.
17322,I was actually told by physicians to wait to see if any clotting effects showed up in any vaccine when they first rolled out before scheduling.
17323,So with that advice I still strongly recommend higher risk people get the mrna vaccine.
17324,We also do not know if the risk of getting covid on top of the risk of covid clots is higher than the vaccine.
17325,The risk of covid alone while social distancing is low  then the risk of covid clot is low.
17326,The risk of vaccine clot is very low for a general population but unknown for higher risk clotting groups.
17327,Clotting from covid was much more likely in a hospitalized patient.
17328,"If i get mild covid, even with my risks, what is then my risk most likely lower."
17329,The big issue is the type of clots.
17330,The vaccine is specifically causing a clotting disorder causing cerebral clots (especially bad for my brain aneurysm) where as covid is causing peripheral clots that can break off and cause pulmonary embolism or stroke but the vaccine specific clot personally I would be more fearful of.
17331,I believe everyone should be aware of the risks and make the decision that puts them in the lowest rosk of harm possible.
17332,With other vaccine options I do not see why the AZ cannot be for low risk group with mrna being prioritized for the high risk clot groups.
17333,"I know it's absolutely insane, but shouldn't people also consider the impact to the greater good beyond themselves and that the vaccines are the only way out of the pandemic?"
17334,They really said the rest of the world are kurwa
17335,Good points!
17336,Other than recommending useless hand sanitizer they didn't give any guidance on how to lower risk.
17337,Nothing about ventilating spaces etc.
17338,I still wonder if HEPA filters would help (maybe they'd make it worse?).
17339,"A study of that would have cost what, maybe a  few grand?"
17340,"And they could have published info on the most effective mask types, even distributed material."
17341,Believing a conspiracy theory would be comfortable compared to the terrifying idea that the people in charge really are this stupid.
17342,Well matters more to some more than other I guess.
17343,"But yes, I expect that the full data for this subset of patients (ie."
17344,fully Vaccinated) considering the CDC is setting up an apparent network for the states to feed this data into.
17345,This seems to be something they are interested in understanding.
17346,They clearly state demographics don’t lend itself to a pattern.
17347,"But would interested to see if any links or patterns are determined (the fact these were predominantly female 18-49, comorbidities etc.)"
17348,Hello fellow hockey player
17349,&gt;The fairest process would have been a common procurement scheme where everyone pays the same price and you allocate according to population (this is what the EU does internally).
17350,This gives smaller and / or poorer nations equal access while keeping prices fair for everyone.
17351,Had this been the case then the mRNA vaccines wouldn't have been developed at all.
17352,No country would be willing to invest in vaccine production infrastructure if the reward was getting a spot in line according to your population.
17353,"But I'm struggling to understand why citizens of a ""smaller"" country like Canada, which has chosen not to invest in its own production capacity or work with manufacturers to set some up, deserves ""equal access"" to something another country spent billions to produce."
17354,Canada has the money and they could've done what Israel did but they chose not to.
17355,"So if they didn't develop the capability to produce their own and didn't pay a premium to get it earlier, how exactly are they getting fucked over?"
17356,What did the US do?
17357,"They're kicking ass as far as the vaccine distribution goes, so I don't know how they're comparable to Brazil's situation currently"
17358,One of the whole points of the European procurement process was that the companies would be made liable.
17359,So yes.
17360,That seems like a local issue though.
17361,"Of all states who release vaccine shots with age info, most of them have around 40% of 60+ year old vaccinated once."
17362,"Bremen is at almost 50%, while Mecklenburg is lagging a bit behind with 33 %."
17363,"Worth noting,  Israel specifically excluded their previously infected individuals from the initial vaccine rollout, so there is an additional 15%-20% immunity on top of their vaccinated portion."
17364,"The US did not do exclusion, so there is more overlapping immunity, they would likely need a higher percentage."
17365,Pfizer or moderna is better ?
17366,I currently have covid for the second time in under 6 months.
17367,I rarely leave the house and when I do leave I'm extremely careful about social distancing and masks.
17368,I'd much rather take the miniscule risk of the vaccine giving me a blood clot then catch this deadly virus for a third time
17369,Yup- and even more than that.
17370,Won’t get into all of the issues like how anyone dying WITH covid doesn’t mean OF covid.
17371,"How the covid stimulus was like 10% to actual covid issues, and how we stopped tracking the flu, and how the mockingbird media only exasperates it."
17372,How it was a great cause to mail out unsolicited mail in ballots.
17373,It’s a great long list.
17374,Many senators did great investing right before covid- right before the Microsoft deal- right before the vaccination deals.
17375,Haven’t thought about covid being an issue for me or my family in over 8 months.
17376,Still wearing mask and social distancing.
17377,Not taking any chances.
17378,My coworker who is anti vax now has the virus and his office is closed.
17379,Were they vaccinated with the two doses?
17380,This is a great point.
17381,"The best part is we don't even need everyone vaccinated, we just need 1-(1/R0) x 100% of the population immune to the disease to begin returning to normal life."
17382,Wouldve been vaccinated by now if not for the the jobnson johnson hold :(
17383,"Tell them to ask their doctors about that please, not random people on the internet."
17384,The risk is not only merely catching the covid but more importantly getting seriously ill.
17385,The vaccine makes you avoid it almost %100
17386,Literally.
17387,The pandemic rules have made people so brainwashed they’re unknowingly turning into anti vaxxers.
17388,I literally addressed that the very next sentence.
17389,"And even the health officials and government have been lifting restrictions for vaccinated people because they are realizing people are already hesitant to get a vaccine, and many see no point if you just need to keep doing what you were doing after."
17390,The problem I see is that it is hard to compete with the message that some politicians are pushing that we will return to a normal life whatever happens.
17391,"If mask mandates are illegal and business are not allowed to restrict unvaccinated customers, it's still easy to rationalize just ignoring the pandemic instead of getting vaccinated."
17392,Why are people upset about this.
17393,Are we just forgetting that there’s a vaccine thats 95% effective and 100% effective in preventing severe cases?
17394,[deleted]
17395,I work in Idaho.
17396,There's a mass vaccine site near my job and I watched it be full for weeks.
17397,"However the past month (when shots were open to more than just the elderly), there have only been a few cars in the parking lot."
17398,It's distressing to see.
17399,You'd be true if the shot did not have %95 efficacy and more importantly ~%100 efficacy against severe illness.
17400,are we just forgetting that there’s a vaccine thats 95% effective and 100% effective in preventing severe cases?
17401,The numbers show a huge improvement but people will just read the headline smh
17402,Shit I'm a healthy 30 something and shingles fucked my world up for a month (and still longer effects like blurry vision when I had perfect vision).
17403,A virus can still love with you forever and it's all because I had chicken pox as a kid this happened.
17404,Well mRNA is very different from our other methods.
17405,I’m curious the compatibility as well.
17406,i mean i guess?
17407,how many people could there possibly be tho?
17408,they are both relatively new platforms....
17409,I don't think anyone has figured that out yet.
17410,"That's likely the subject of studies or future studies, particularly the mixing of different vaccine studies."
17411,"Smarter people than me can make educated guesses, but I'd imagine the options include just you get a 2.0 version of whatever (like the flu vaccine there is no need to track it), a booster no different than the folks that got a v1 mRNA vaccine, or a booster from the maker of your initial vaccine."
17412,I imagine they'll have studies finished up before they issue guidance.
17413,"Sounds like you fall in to the ""let's fuck around and find out"" category."
17414,Go right ahead...
17415,"Yeah, its hard for me to explain to my friends back in the US how much of an absolute shit show the vaccine roll out here has been with the EU's reliance on AstraZenica."
17416,Like idk how you can come up with a reasonable rollout plan if you need to factor in AZ's potential for fuck ups at each stage.
17417,"Edit: Also, I know Norway isn't part of the EU, but from what I can tell you guys have been in more or less the same boat as us."
17418,I've not heard of anyone feeling bad for more than 2 days.
17419,Nobody I know personally has felt bad for more than 12 hours.
17420,Nowhere near a week.
17421,"But if you'd rather risk hospitalization, death, spreading it to friends and family, coworkers, etc... cool."
17422,Cool cool cool.
17423,"I don't understand what you are saying about the urgent care regarding ""going through them."""
17424,"Find a different urgent care, ask for an appointment and say ""I got the vaccine recently and am having these side effects, can a provider see me?"""
17425,"If you have insurance, they won't turn you away."
17426,Every health care provider knows to just tell people to go to the ER.
17427,We do it cover ourselves and to shift responsibility to someone else while sticking the patient with the cost.
17428,"If he is walking, drinking, and has no immunocompromising disorders, he doesn't need to be in the ED."
17429,"I repeat, go to urgent care."
17430,[removed]
17431,India is in the middle of a religious festival with hundreds of thousands going into the Ganges without any distancing or masks etc.
17432,This is sadly just the tip of the iceberg!
17433,That’s not the narrative?
17434,"It may be we need yearly vaccinations, we may not."
17435,It’s too early to tell.
17436,I suspect it will be at least recommended next year.
17437,As time goes on that could change
17438,"Yes it's safe, they are fully vaccinated, they could cough in your mouth and you'll still be safe (from covid at least), have fun."
17439,The amount of cases does matter as it means there was more exposure overall in the trials run during the height of the pandemic.
17440,The problem is there are just too many differences in the trial conditions and criteria to make an apples to apples comparison.
17441,You people are crazy
17442,probably as in I probably wont fall into the sub .1% death rate of covid for people with no other risk factors?
17443,"My problem is that they’re saying COVID infection, not defining it as COVID symptomatic infection."
17444,Do you really not understand the difference?
17445,My issue is how they’re arriving at the 8x figure.
17446,"Aye...one of the worst beers ever made, i'd rather drink a shot of the vaccine."
17447,Could logically be an explanation of why cases in Michigan are high and Texas low
17448,If there are people who are willing to take J&amp;J but unwilling to take Moderna/Pfizer then what happens if you pull J&amp;J?
17449,Obviously.
17450,"But if you can avoid cutting it short, you might want to do that."
17451,The Threshold for herd immunity is also likely lower in warmer weather than the winter
17452,A majority of people do not get the new vaccine yearly ....
17453,Exxxactly.
17454,It is a false choice!
17455,At this point i rather stay safe and avoid covid then to take something with any risk of severe blood clots.
17456,"Well most of the time yes, thousands do die from the flu,

Plus if you can avoid a severe case of the flu, i'm sure people would want to do what they can which is why so many take the shot every year..."
17457,Even worse is Michigan...
17458,Last I read they do not believe so.
17459,"Or, it's extremely unlikely."
17460,The vaccines aren't 100% perfect
17461,102 fever usually isn’t dangerous.
17462,Fever doesn’t start getting life threatening on its own until the 104+ range.
17463,I’d have him take a Tylenol and drink tons of water.
17464,Nice try hoser
17465,With the variants (particularly P1) it is.
17466,It's better safe than sorry.

17485,"This is misleading because if you take the shot, then it's a probability of getting a clot."
17486,"With Covid out in the wild and you out in the wild, that 8 times probability becomes infinite."
17487,"If you get a shot or two , then you stop getting shots."
17488,"If you get Covid once, you can get it again and again so it never stops."

17521,They only looked at data from Americans vaccinated with Pfizer and Moderna

17526,Next week has potential to be great.
17527,Let's hope
17528,Oh that makes sense.
17529,I thought it was specifically for the vaccine
17530,Yeah I told him I had it two days before.
17531,But I phrased it as “the 13th” and he said March 13th?
17532,I said no April but maybe he still thought March for some reason?
17533,Yeah I got poked pretty hard.
17534,Still sore three days after getting it but it’s getting better
17535,That would be very difficult in terms of messaging and enforcement.
17536,Better to have an easy to understand and enforce rule (“wear a mask that covers your nose and mouth”) and have most people wear a decent mask.
17537,&gt; Yeah right.
17538,Between January 31st and April 13th there have been over 113 million doses exported from the EU.
17539,This even excludes any deliveries from the 2 months before that.
17540,"Yeah, I know enough."
17541,"It also excludes exports of Covid vaccines from the EU to Covax, Israel and a dozen other countries that aren't under the EU's export control regime."
17542,They did indeed edit the article
17543,This is awesome by the way.
17544,If they can mix and match we will be better heard immune.
17545,They changed the article then.
17546,It wasn't when I wrote this
17547,"People getting the vaccine are commonly getting pretty knocked around by it for a few days as their body makes its immune response, which is fine and normal and I'd be fine with that if it offered long term protection, but I'm not going to forcibly make myself sick for a week each year, fuck that."
17548,I'll just stay healthy and take my chances with covid
17549,not wearing a mask is definitely not gunna kill me.
17550,Oh fine!
17551,It didn't hurt that much anyway!

17557,"90% efficacy means that if half the country is vaccinated and there are 100,000 daily cases, then 10,000 of them would be vaccinated people."
17558,"So, yes you are still at risk if the virus is widely circulating."
17559,"However, if everybody is vaccinated then there is little risk to catching covid."
17560,Eventually if you add vaccinated with people with natural immunity you will start to reach herd immunity.
17561,Philly too.
17562,That is very true for all places with high prevalence.
17563,"But not in the context of Denmark’s positive situation for the past months - reopening (slowly) without rising numbers, testing 8% of the population per day, very few hospitalised, already using mainly Pfizer vaccine - their calculation is different."
17564,Reopening is not being postponed because of this.
17565,It’s speeding up because there’s less cases than even the most optimistic prognosis.
17566,I assume they have high confidence in the ability of the humongous testing capacity to keep cases low.
17567,.
17568,But that's assuming everyone will get covid.
17569,It does not also account for the fact that all at-risk have ben vaccinated.
17570,That's probably true.
17571,The pandemic really allowed Biden to keep a low profile and look presidential.
17572,I also am not sure how whether the Senate would have flipped in a non-pandemic year.
17573,I feel as though Pfizer absolutely deserves to make $50 billion
17574,Weed isn't approved in the U.S. and I'm sure you've done it
17575,"Not impossible, but the odds should be dramatically reduced."
17576,"This is probably the best study: /r/COVID19/comments/mfrv1i/interim_estimates_of_vaccine_effectiveness_of/ ""Under real-world conditions, mRNA vaccine effectiveness of full immunization (≥14 days after second dose) **was 90% against SARS-CoV-2 infections regardless of symptom status;** vaccine effectiveness of partial immunization (≥14 days after first dose but before second dose) was 80%""."
17577,"If people can't be infected at all, they can't possibly transmit."
17578,"This paper, if correct, is saying that your odds of spreading is cut by at least 90% after being fully vaccinated."
17579,A previous infection is estimated to cut down the odds by around 80% according to some studies.
17580,"A relative of mine is a GP: if an under 30 needs to be vaccinated they are telling them the risk and saying that they don't have any non-AZ vaccine available, so they can decide whether to wait potentially a month or more for an alternative or take AZ."
17581,"Having linked the gov.uk pages, I cannot work them out, because there seems to be a lot of contradictory numbers on there."
17582,Poe is clearly correct.
17583,Thank you for the link.
17584,Had my first shot of Pfizer yesterday at noon and so far I’ve just had the sore arm.
17585,"Took a friend’s advice and have been taking Tylenol immediately after the dose so maybe that helped, too."
17586,May have felt the drag coming at night and went to bed a little earlier than usual but felt fine through the night.
17587,I have heard that the second dose is the big one so maybe that will be the case for me.
17588,That same friend seemed to have the big side effects during the first dose and coasted through the second.

17593,There was plenty of research coming in since at least May 2020 showing that COVID spreading through surfaces was highly unlikely.
17594,So while recommending caution in the beginning was certainly a smart thing to do; they could have admitted the truth much earlier than they did.

17614,"I just needed to know my name, appointment time and birthday."
17615,I showed no paperwork.
17616,I somehow expected the downvotes tbh :)
17617,Lets be honest.
17618,With no pandemic Trump probably gets re-elected.
17619,Plenty of places were ignoring the eligibility rules.
17620,"No lying required, and the vaccine sites were (on some occasions) open about this."
17621,"Plus, you had people getting doses that were left over at the end of the day from places that *were* observing eligibility rules."
17622,Your math is wrong for comparing C19 and the AZ potential.
17623,Death from C19 hovers in the 2% range.
17624,The AZ clotting problem leading to death?
17625,That's hovering at 0.0004%.
17626,I didn't study math but one of those percentages is almost certainly worse.
17627,"Viruses mutate and they have, they are infecting and spreading via kids easier, and also harming younger populations (see Brazil)."
17628,"&gt; Canada didn't have those sites, a private company did and they were not ready to produce mRNA vaccines and Canada did fuck all to help them get them ready for production."
17629,"Yes, those are sites that produce a completely different kind of vaccine, based on different technology."
17630,"Changing that is a huge undertaking, no matter if the site is state owned or private."
17631,I.e I know that Biontech bought an additional plant in Germany that they modified to produce mRNA.
17632,That was 8 months ago and they just started production.
17633,GSK/Sanofi knew in December that their vaccine would not work as planned.
17634,That was like 5 Months ago and you do not even know how suitable the equipment for protein based vaccines would be for mRNA prodcution.
17635,"Do you want to time travel to August last year and tell everyone that mRNA is the way to go and to abandon recombinant protein vaccines, so please start converting those factories asap?"
17636,Yet countries are determined to kill these two vaccines.
17637,After covid I almost guarantee viral vectors will never be used again for vaccines
17638,"The data showed that about 4 in every 1 million people who get the American-made vaccines experience cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT), or blood clots in the brain."

17644,I hate this type of rhetoric.
17645,"""Finally admits it was wrong."""
17646,Bullshit.
17647,It was not wrong to recommend caution when we were dealing with a brand new virus that we knew to be highly contagious and very deadly and that we knew could live on surfaces.
17648,Saying they were wrong is like saying I was wrong to look both ways before crossing the street.
17649,I still wish so much I lived in Sweden right now.
17650,Nope :) they changed it.
17651,What is it with these news headlines that go [something happens] *as* [something else happens].
17652,"Sometimes the two are vaguely related, sometimes there is no real connection between them."
17653,I know this article is about Europe but in the US the vaccines aren’t technically approved
17654,[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe%27s\_law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe%27s_law)
17655,Can you link a British Government statement that European countries were making up a link between the AZ vaccine and clotting?
17656,"Ah I apologize if the original title was different, I thought the OP was trying to editorialize with their thread title choice, my bad."
17657,The title is not edited.
17658,"If you click the link, you will see it is the title of the article."
17659,But it’s not baseless speculating either way.
17660,A much larger study of over 50k people was done in the UK that found the variant to be more deadly.
17661,This study is under 400 and the other lancet study just over 400 people.
17662,"While I hope these two studies are correct and there was something else at play in the large UK study, continually reposting the same lancet studies from different news sites doesn’t make it the definitive answer."
17663,Lol.
17664,America is fucked up.
17665,"Not an American, got my jab, for free, work said sure see you later, heres all your money anyway."
17666,Absolutely no hesitation by anyone involved.
17667,"America is very rapidly becoming dark humour, I used to want to live there when I was little, but I would never consider downgrading my quality of life now that I’m an adult."
17668,Hope they're putting in their own money too instead of just relying on regular families who've likely been struggling the last year...
17669,"CNBC changed the title I think, I saw the old one when I opened it."
17670,It is the clotting that is the main danger though.
17671,"The American Healthcare system created this problem by dubiously charging some people to be TESTED for COVID-19 towards the start of the pandemic, which was reported by multiple news outlets...so there’s no surprise that many would believe the vaccine and its reputation as hard to obtain wouldn’t have some cost associated with them."
17672,"&gt;worthwhile tradeoff

words of comfort for those spending weeks/months in ICU, followed by post-viral complications of interminable length."
17673,"But hey, survival of the fittest right?"
17674,"It's worth considering, too, that a lot of countries got the virus under control by taking it seriously back when case numbers were small."
17675,My relatives in Vietnam were freaking out over a small handful of cases last winter that led to zero deaths.
17676,"The pro-COVID faction in the U.S. would say that that's overreacting, but Vietnam avoided a national tragedy last year by *not* waiting until there were millions of cases to take action."
17677,"Countries that took this seriously from the start are exactly why we can confidently blame the response in America for those 500,000+ deaths and why the jokers claiming the deaths were unavoidable can be safely ignored."
17678,"That bit about ""it's only 15 cases that will go to zero soon"" was perhaps the most stupid thing a politician said last year, about a phenomenon that grows *exponentially*."
17679,"Because growth is exponential (for a while, anyway), you have to stop it while total numbers are small."
17680,"Not only do these people not understand math and science, but they also seem to see the world in black or white."
17681,Vaccines work 100% or not at all.
17682,Masks work 100% or not at all.
17683,I can’t figure out if these people are truly that stupid or if they just bend the truth to fit their world view.
17684,Vaccine passports until the pandemic is over.
17685,Not forever.
17686,"And vaccines shouldn't be mandated by the government, they should be mandated by private companies and verified through the block chain when you buy tickets to an event."
17687,It would be zero hassle other than inputting your vaccine info once.

17715,you want your second dose for increased long term protection.
17716,"I’m not sure they’ll ever give a choice, is the thing."

17737,"I never made that claim, slick."
17738,So I take it you don’t have a source then?
17739,That makes a lot of sense because all anyone has right now are estimates based on antigen decay rates (because the effectiveness of the vaccine outlasted any of the clinical trials).
17740,"3-6 month estimates were debunked as fear mongering, anti-vaxer nonsense with companies estimating adequate protection for 1-2 years which is on par for what we see with annual vaccines like flu shots."

17743,"While it's entirely possible that we COULD eventually ""kill"" Covid19 through herd immunity with the various vaccines it's seemingly less and less likely this happens as time goes on."
17744,"The main way we'd ""kill"" a virus this way would be if there were enough people immune to the virus such that it eventually runs out of viable hosts to keep it alive and spreading."
17745,"Part of the problem with this idea is that a big part of the effectiveness of current Covid vaccines is that they greatly reduce the major symptoms of the virus and prevent hospitalization as you stated BUT that doesn't mean that vaccinated individuals aren't able to get the virus and thus keep it ""alive"" and spreading as they are still viable hosts even if they don't become as sick as those that are not vaccinated."
17746,We've also seen a LOT of mutations with the various variants.
17747,Not to say that the current vaccines don't seem effective against those variants but this means it's unlikely that the virus will just suddenly stop mutating so it's always possible it eventually ends up mutating such that the current vaccines are no longer as effective unfortunately.
17748,We also don't have any real information on how long the current vaccines provide protection.
17749,They should not have banned it.

Airborne means a free floating virus particle suspended in air; surfaces, or fomites, are inanimate objects that surround us."
17754,Does that clarify a bit?
17755,I wasn’t sure what you meant by contradicting each other.
17756,&gt; It would mean that after 2 doses people with symptomatic disease are proportionally hospitalized more even when they're not serious.
17757,"I have no scientific research or training to back this up, but could this be for the same reason that people tend to experience more severe vaccine side effects after their second dose?"
17758,"The first dose teaches your body that it doesn't like this stuff, so when the second dose hits it mounts a strong immune response, which includes things like fever and chills and generally feeling like garbage."
17759,"It seems logical to me that a third ""encounter"" (two vaccine doses and then an actual infection for the third) would cause your body to run in with figurative guns blazing."
17760,"Those symptoms might prompt people to go to the hospital and possibly be admitted because of high fevers and whatever, but then they never develop serious illness (because their body's strong response fights the virus off)."
17761,"And a much more important note:

&gt;Risk of blood clot from COVID is **eight times higher** than from a COVID vaccine"
17762,"There is not a safety risk to ""not going skiing""."

17819,The interval was chosen to get the trials done quickly while still ensuring a robust response.
17820,"On TWiV a few weeks ago Brianne said something along the lines of ""three weeks is the minimum, but the ideal gap could be many months or a few years."""
17821,Can't really get better than what we have though.
17822,"It works, and you have up to six weeks recommended interval between shots."
17823,"But why do countries like Denmark deny those people; who are willing to take the vaccine - even under the risk, still the vaccine, make it a people’s choice."
17824,I could say I'm a doctor right now and you couldn't disprove me.

17829,*
17830,Sounds right.
17831,That is how it happened for my Aunt.
17832,"The email is sometimes delayed but you should get it, check your spam folder."
17833,"&gt;“I just know in my heart that the vaccines are safe,” and waiting for the science to catch up

No, we're literally pausing the J&amp;J vaccine to make a scientific determination on its safety."
17834,"No one in the scientific community is saying they ""just know"" the vaccine is safe."
17835,That's why they recommended pausing it's use.
17836,That’s bureaucratic Lawyer-mindset for you.
17837,Always finding problems as to why certain solutions don’t work.
17838,"Bogus interpretation of privacy protection, bogus interpretation of 'freedom' and „Verhältnismaßigkeit“."
17839,A certain part of our demographic is seriously dumb.
17840,Unfortunately it seems to be largely people in public offices.
17841,Tuvix warns of unintended consequences!
17842,Mmm.
17843,And there are plenty of those.
17844,I can't help but think of people's families and friends when I see a group of unmasked teenagers in a car (last night) or the friends gathered to chat before leaving a house (unmasked).
17845,I even felt for the grizzled old man waiting to pay for gas...unmasked.
17846,"Why, why, why won't they listen?"
17847,We always make fun of the US and especially of Trump in the EU but look at us now.
17848,Mismanagement on all levels of government.
17849,From the president of the EU Council to every single mayor in every single town on this continent.
17850,No one had the spine to do what needed to be done to prevent this disaster.
17851,The consequences of this total failure will be felt for decades to come.
17852,"The different vaccines have not been tested in side by side trials, so it's not a simple case of AZ has worse results."
17853,None of the vaccines have gone through the normal vigorous testing schedules they would have to go through pre and post COVID emergency.
17854,"So right now it's a case that a particular side effect of AZ has shown up in the wild, but is very limited in those affected by it."
17855,"Given that vaccines usually go through many years of testing and can still have unseen side effects, we may yet see one of the other vaccines give more serious side effects."
17856,"I'm not saying there will be, just that there could be."
17857,Hell we could find out everyone that took the mRNA vaccines are now sterile if they also eat chilli and regularly sleep less than 10 hours a day.
17858,"ofc this is ridiculous, but the point is that we won't really know the full effect of the vaccines for a few years yet, i.e."
17859,the equivalent time a vaccine would normally stay in controlled testing.
17860,"&amp;#x200B;

As for why countries would buy AZ, it would probably be a combination of there not being nearly enough vac to go round, the much cheaper cost of AZ, and the much easier storage and transport requirements of AZ."
17861,Yes it's a wonder.
17862,"They've obviously wised up on that stance since, have you noticed?"
17863,"The science evolved as more facts were presented, those people got stuck on that and couldn't handle it."
17864,I am saying we shutdown in the first place for nothing.
17865,Wonder why the flu magically dropped to record low numbers and no one died...oh wait they were “Covid” deaths.
17866,"He’s a reliable source, if you actually watched the video, you might realize that :)"
17867,Im not saying that Pfizer should not make money or get an especially low price.
17868,Im fine with them making 50 billion in profits or whatever.
17869,"What im not fine with is this whole ""why did nation x not simply pay as much money as Israel"" idea, since it does not scale."
17870,It only works a long as one person does it.
17871,Else it only leads to huge price inflation that fucks over everyone and especially poor countries.
17872,"Same goes for the ""they should have ordered earlier"" idea."
17873,"Someone will be first, and everyone else wont be."
17874,Whoever ordered his doses in December 2019 can be all smug and everyone else can go screw themselves.
17875,This should not be some nationalistic race about who can pay more or order earlier.
17876,"It should be an effort on how to best beat the pandemic on an international scale, and not primarily a competition to score the most domestic points."
17877,"The article gives some demographic information about these ""breakthrough"" cases, but I wish there was geographical and behavioral data as well- i.e., are these cases clustering in regions that have abandoned masking and other restrictions?"
17878,Much much less.
17879,"And, critically, people would still be getting vaccinated."
17880,"I doubt most people would need a booster for their mRNA vaccine in ~6 months, but people at high risk of exposure (heath care workers) or severe disease (elderly) might opt for the extra protection."
17881,"People who received the J&amp;J vaccine could also stand to benefit as it's less effective, particularly against some of the variants."
17882,"Plus, it's a proof of concept for how quickly and effectively the vaccine can be retooled to target mutations."
17883,"It's likely that mutation will eventually make the current vaccines ineffective, even if that's much longer down the line."
17884,"Without calculating it through completely, when I just look at the numbers of daily Covid deaths, the odds that I will die of Covid is quite high compared to the odds that I die due to the vaccine."
17885,More so as the problem with J&amp;J and AZ seem to mostly affect people who take hormone pills (which I don't do).
17886,I am willing to take my chances here.
17887,Do we really need an American comparison for the most visited city in the world?
17888,which allows restaurants and gyms to operate at their socially distanced maximum capacity
17889,Because it’s fucking weird to wear masks at a concert?
17890,Same reason it would be really weird to wear masks when dancing at a club?
17891,I guess these Reddit neckbeards probably just haven’t been to any
17892,&gt;Remember all those other lockdowns that barely worked?
17893,"They did work, things only ever started going wrong after the end of the lockdowns."
17894,Lockdowns are much quicker at bringing cases down than vaccines.
17895,If we hadn't locked down in January and just relied on vaccines cases and deaths would have stayed high for much longer whilst everyone was getting vaccinated.
17896,"The lockdown did the majority of the work in bringing cases down from the peak quickly, with vaccines helping to accelerate that drop later on."
17897,The main job of the vaccines is to stop cases and deaths from going out of control again now that we're starting to open up again.
17898,I hope you are right.
17899,It looks like the clotting risk can be managed as well.
17900,And the risk is still very low regardless.
17901,"You don't feed trolls, kiddo."
17902,You expose them for what they are.
17903,If it weren't true you wouldn't be so triggered into a response.
17904,Yeah bc tiktok isn't a reliable source and anyone can claim they're anything on the internet
17905,"Ah yes, the urgency to deliver to Japan, which has an administration rate of 5% and reports 20 deaths per day."
17906,Priorities 🤷🏼‍♂️
17907,She's a head of state though.
17908,That kind of pushes you to the front of the line.

17961,"&gt; Among those who started the survey before the announcement about the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine pause, about half (52%) considered the shot “very safe” or “somewhat safe” - twice the number who believed it “very unsafe” or “somewhat unsafe”."
17962,"After the announcement was made, these figures had converged - just 37% called the vaccine safe, and 39% feeling it unsafe."

17967,I think the key thing here is the ownership of the intellectual property.
17968,"You are right, no government has manufacturing capacity."
17969,That is what the pharma companies bring to the table.
17970,But with that they should not be given any ownership of the intellectual property.
17971,That should stay with the funders of the R&amp;D. They can then dish out the manufacturing to the lowest bidder.
17972,"The companies will make profit, but just not outrageously high profits as they get for patented products."
17973,"So this for the medicines that the countries need urgently, such as a vaccine during a pandemic."
17974,"If the pharma companies want to develop a statin that's 10% more effective than their older version that's coming out of patent, they are free to do so with their own money and then own the patent to that as well."

17982,"Right, but that info is out there now."
17983,It's all over the news and being discussed by randos on Reddit.
17984,"If it hasn't reached clinicians yet, then we have a different, bigger problem."
17985,"Right, then as the other poster says, it is up to the authorities of different regions to consider the likelihood of infection and availability of alternative vaccines and compute that risk assessment."
17986,"For most countries currently suffering under the pandemic, they should just take any jab they can get."
17987,Why not?
17988,That's what the infection fatality rate is: deaths per infection.

18054,2) You can't compare mortality like that and it's also why we do controlled trials to estimate the efficacy of a vaccine.

18056,Because you are assuming that the same number of people got covid in the first place in both the vaccinated and non vaccinated population.
18057,Let's say we have 1 milione people non vaccinated and 1 milione people fully vaccinated.

18059,In the vaccinated group 100 people might get covid and 1 might die (1% fatality rate according to your calculation).
18060,So if you just see this flawed fatality rate you might think it is not working but once you compare the two you see that your chance of dying is dramatically lowered if you get vaccinated.

18093,"&gt; The risk of CVT following COVID-19 is also higher than the latest estimate from the European Medicines Agency for the incidence associated with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (5.0 per million people, 95% CI 4.3–5.8)."
18094,"Although requiring replication and corroboration, the present data highlight the risk of serious thrombotic events in COVID-19, and can help contextualizethe risks and benefits of vaccination in this regard."
18095,That's assuming these are independent variables.
18096,These could be connected.
18097,Those who were more likely to have severe disease anyways may be more likely to catch COVID despite the vaccine.
18098,"It's could be that people who had a weak immune response to the COVID vaccine and didn't build immunity, would have also had a weak immune response to real COVID and gotten really sick/died."
18099,"By that metric, you could argue that if anything, this vaccine is saving some of the people who would have definitely died without it, but juat isn't saving everyone."
18100,That does seem to be assuming you get covid.
18101,"They still drew the conclusion that “There’s no doubt that Covid is a much greater risk of this [condition] than any of the vaccines,” said Professor Paul Harrison, a co-author of the study » and there are no actual numbers in the article, so it’s hard to check for ourselves"

18127,"You’re right; our issue isn’t with supply or alternatives, it’s with a percentage of our population."

18164,They're expecting more.
18165,That doesn't sound scientifically accurate
18166,There really isn't an issue with wrong locations.

18179,*
18180,"I can't help but go back to a thought I had a little while ago, but I think I dismissed because it didn't have any evidence - maybe someone can help me out and give me clarity."
18181,"To some degree, it felt like to me that because this reaction seems to stem from the sort of antibodies your body creates when it encounters spike proteins, and because I had heard of blood clots being an issue with covid, that what this reaction could be a product of is just some people's immune response with this antibody, regardless of how you got it (vaccine/virus)."
18182,"If this really were the case, I figured we'd see some of these incidences in every vaccine group, and that didn't seem to REALLY be the case."
18183,"However some recent news alluded to the fact that it actually might be happening in every vaccine group, just to different degrees."
18184,"What are people's thoughts, am I way off base here?"
18185,"Well with america's history, it's totally reasonable to assume they were charging for it."
18186,There really isn't a way to know for sure in individual cases.
18187,On average people who are vaccinated have more mild illness though so they may actually still be better off  than if they were never vaccinated.
18188,"But if its 5 in a million for AZ, and you're saying that's the background expectation anyway."
18189,Then what's the problem with AZ?
18190,Or is 4 in a million the expectation and its just that 1 extra case per million causing concern?
18191,"I mean, at the time we didn't know."
18192,"Studies had come out showing covid particles could live on various surface for days, even weeks."
18193,People were concerned.
18194,There's nothing wrong with a serious news show running a serious piece informing concerned listeners of the facts during a brand-new global pandemic.
18195,It's kind of like going from SPF 25 to 100 sunblock.
18196,Unless you're laying naked in the middle of the dessert all day it probably doesn't matter.
18197,But I guess statistically there is potentially some benefit.
18198,Some people will do it to either feel better or make a statement.
18199,"I have seen people in the grocery store with masks, gloves, a big plastic shield around their head, etc."
18200,None of this is recommended but hey fly your caution flag.
18201,"I got the shot, and not only was it easy but they were literally begging me to get in touch with anyone who wants a shot, no appointment needed, because they had too many."
18202,Thanks for the correction!
18203,"I was so ready for side effects due to the ridiculous number of posts I was seeing about them, I've had both doses of Pfizer now, absolutely no side effects but a sore arm, very anti climactic."
18204,So yeah totally depends on the person.
18205,Btw that's also not how efficacy is calculated.
18206,In trials efficacy is calculated compared to a non vaccinated group but it doesn't represent your chance of getting infected if you are exposed to the virus.
18207,"Millions have taken it, with trials starting around a year ago."
18208,Had it been dangerous we would know by now.
18209,"There have been serious adverse effects from other types of vaccines in the past, but these all show themselves within weeks and lead to the vaccines being withdrawn from the market."
18210,Look at how serious they treat the AstraZeneca blood clots.
18211,They will not give unsafe products.
18212,There isn't any reason for the vaccine to suddenly have side effects that shows themselves several months or years after taking it.
18213,What you are left with then are antibodies and immune cells.
18214,"Which you would also have from covid, just that covid can kill you."
18215,The only thing that is left to see with the vaccine is how long it lasts.
18216,I hope nothing I wrote gave the impression the vaccine isn't working.
18217,"That would be your misinterpretation, due to not knowing how infection fatality rates are defined."
18218,The infection fatality rate in your two groups is indeed the same.
18219,That's not nonsense; it's an important result.
18220,"It's been claimed that vaccines not only reduce the chances of being infected, they also reduce the severity of disease and chances of death if you are infected."
18221,"If they don't do that, it's important to know."
18222,A better criticism of my post is that the infection fatality rate depends on age.
18223,It's much higher in people who are over 80.
18224,"We don't know the age breakdown of the vaccinated group, although the article does say that only 40% of the infections are over 60."
18225,"So there's hope that this fatality rate isn't representative of the general population, and the actual rate in the general population is better."
18226,"Such has been claimed, I have been looking out for confirmation of it in articles like this, but I've not found it yet."
18227,"Yeah, this political move is really helpful, even though it wasn't needed at all."
18228,Thanks.
18229,"I know it totally depends on the person, it just makes me feel a bit better."
18230,I was supposed to get J&amp;J today originally but glad I didn’t lol
18231,"Specificity for administering the shot though, right?"
18232,My understanding is the shot was paid for by the government regardless and insurance will reimburse for the cost of the nurse/etc to administer it.
18233,"Ironically it would be great news for the vaccine rollout, no vaccine vs AZ is an easy win for AZ, the only problem is when there is a clearly safer vaccine available like the mRNA vaccines."
18234,If they demonstrated the same issue then we would be back to full steam ahead on all vaccines
18235,I don’t know that detailed treatments are all over reddit..also cdc and fda have to review before making that final treatment recommendation.
18236,The review started yesterday and they said it should be only days before it’s done
18237,Don't lump as all in with you
18238,(See my username) Here like 95% of people walking outside wear a mask.
18239,Not wearing one is likeg oing out in your underwear at this point.
18240,"I don't necessarily agree, thats just how it is here."
18241,You have absolutely no idea what long term dangers are of covid in children because it’s only been 1 year since the disease has been around.
18242,"I’m glad you think my fears for my child developing long term respiratory problems are unreasonable, but neither I nor many other parents care what you think."
18243,"You want to have kids and expose them to a disease, go right ahead."
18244,"also, because it would be in individual decision, you would have almost no risk at all if herd immunity is present (infecting yourself is unlikely) and you don't take AZ which could cause blood clots"
18245,Deaths from COVID take a long time to get into official stats though.
18246,Around 5 weeks from infection to reported.
18247,"So if it takes 5-6 weeks to get fully vaccinated, then another 5 weeks to catch it after that and then to be reported, then we are not talking about nearly as many potential candidates for fully vaccinated/dead as it would seem."
18248,And that's even just counting people who get infected the very first day of being fully vaccinated.
18249,This big delay probably makes the vaccinated/death number lower than the reality of what the vaccine prevents.
18250,"Now, that said, there are factors working in the other direction as well, such as the earliest vaccines going to older people."
18251,"So idk what the ""real"" answer here is, other than that the vaccine clearly helps quite a bit."
18252,"thank you for your answer, but am surprised that people are downvoting my question."
18253,So do you think that the people who got admitted with full vaccination are just bad luck or it would have been worse if they weren't vaccinated in the first place?
18254,That's out of 77 million people that means after getting your shot (in primarily high risk population mind you) your chances of dying of covid is like 0.00001% over this time period.
18255,It will only continue to go down as the population of vaccinated people starts to resemble the whole country more AND the subsequent decrease in overall case numbers.
18256,Seems to be a very individual response.
18257,After my first shot I was just a little tired that night and had some tightness / stiffness in my legs.
18258,Shoulder was a little sore.
18259,No fever.
18260,No headache.
18261,Within 24  hours felt very good.
18262,"Second shot, I had no reaction and was expecting to be done 24-48 hrs."
18263,EXACTLY
18264,"She was our chancellor for 4 periods, and current polls show that the CDU (her party) might lose in the election because the candidate isn’t popular"
18265,Me saying that it takes weeks for vaccines to provide immunity is pretending that people aren't getting vaccinated?
18266,In what world does that make sense?
18267,I came here hoping to post this... take my upvote beautiful stranger!
18268,It *is* fully covered.
18269,You shouldn't pay a dime for it.
18270,They ask for insurance for medical record purposes and because they can bill your insurance company.
18271,The actual vaccine costs something like $28-$34 (you can find it on CMS website).
18272,The administration costs $0.10.
18273,They can bill the insurance company for both iirc.
18274,I don’t think people are getting hesitant about COVID vaccines in general.
18275,"The problem is the time lost, every day you wait around is hundreds more deaths and more billions lost to lockdowns."
18276,"The most rediculous part is that they just stop, wait a few days, come to the conclusion that whatever side effects benefits are still higher than risks and green light to resume administrations."
18277,Repeat this process over and over.
18278,Yeah the guy who changes his mind every other week.
18279,“Would you rather get stroke from covid or AZ?”
18280,About everybody has had surges and re-surges by now so it's not something especially noteworthy.
18281,We're not that bad situation to be honest.
18282,Dont you see why there is a benefit in not being overly oppressive with lockdows?
18283,"Right now there's a perception that some vaccines are better than others, however even the two now paused vaccines would probably be a net benefit to the world if everyone got them today."
18284,"Yes there are risks, but the question is whether more people will die from covid as a result of vaccinations being postponed while we are waiting for increased supply from the ""better ones""."
18285,I don't envy the experts having to make this calculation while trying to figure out why some people get blood clots from these vaccines.
18286,More than a month since Novavax published its Phase III results and yet they haven’t applied for authorization with the MHRA.
18287,It really isn't that much of a concern but AZ backed up as have some govts out of an abundance of caution.
18288,Even a small issue like this as you can see can be blown up like crazy.
18289,"Also it is worth noting that although the incidence is 6 in 6 million, we know that the clotting issues appears more in a certain demo - women who are on birth control medication (and therefore younger as they are pre-menopausal)."
18290,Another complication here is that birth control medication can rarely cause blood clots *on its own* so the vaccine might not even be relevant anyway.
18291,"But point is the incidence was 6 in 6 million, but it is higher if you are in that demo which is where all 6 issues occurred."
18292,How long does coronavirus remain viable in the air?
18293,"I can only find information that states the virus remains in the air for 3 hours, but that sounds like the virus settles onto a surface after 3 hours, not that it has become non-viable."
18294,This kind of stuff turned me off to Facebook and on to Reddit.
18295,Facts and evidence-based discussions on Reddit are so much better than the idiocy that occurs on Facebook.
18296,SHE'S GOING TO RETIRE THIS YEAR!?
18297,NOOOOOOOOO
18298,No its because they are too lazy.
18299,Wrong
18300,Not my intention.
18301,Will delete
18302,I don't know if this is right but what I heard was that the type of clot they saw with j and j was rare.
18303,The platelets accumulate in the clot leaving the rest of the blood supply low on platelets and therefore vulnerable to  bleeding.
18304,This is how dr gupta explained it on cnn.
18305,Could also be a variant.
18306,Yeah.
18307,#CannotRelate
18308,This is a really misleading post title.
18309,"Here is the actual headline:

""With Johnson &amp; Johnson’s vaccine on pause, the consequences could ripple worldwide."""
18310,"OP is pretty irresponsible, imo."
18311,You mean taxpayer funded
18312,"You’re right, many kids went back sooner, my bad."
18313,"More accurately, kids didn’t benefit from online learning."
18314,"There are millions of kids who haven’t attended a day of school, and those that did attend the virtual sessions didn’t get much out of them."
18315,Plus there are holdout districts which are really just doing their best effort at fucking over their students.
18316,"Maybe it’s slightly, slightly better than nothing at all."
18317,"But studies have shown that the longer you do virtual school, the less you get out of it, and you don’t get anything out of it after more than just a few weeks."
18318,If it works it is very unlikely to show a difference between variants.
18319,"The interaction with the virus particle is more like a hammer than a vaccine, no time to determine whether there is a slight mutation on the spike protein...smash smash smash everything (note: this is not the scientific terminology of function)."
18320,Right ok.
18321,Apologies.
18322,Just thinking it’s a real shame people are being put off vaccines by some arguably over-cautious governments’ positions.
18323,"Immunity generally doesn't just expire one day, it usually gradually declines over many months or even years or decades."
18324,"As an example, people vaccinated in 1976 for the swine flu then were still better protected in 2009 against that swine flu."
18325,The vaccines are not perfect so there is always a chance of being infected post vaccination but on average we know the chances are significantly reduced.
18326,Idiots making stupid statements.
18327,[removed]
18328,"thank god, my 3 year old is in quarantine for the 2nd time, because 3 other kids tested positive in her day care class and looking at their parents it really isnt a wonder."
18329,"thankfully mine is negative, but entire daycare had to close, i have to stay home, ergo we loose wages for 10 days again...just because some ppl think who cares if the children get it or not."
18330,that vaccine cant come fast enough
18331,"Some people here seem miss the point:

Nobody would voluntarily infect themselves with Covid."
18332,Any vaccine is ofc much better than a Covid infection.
18333,Nodody has ever claimed otherwise.
18334,"But depending on where you live and what you do, yor risk of getting a covid infection in, say, the next 6 month might be rather low."
18335,"Now, if AZ would be the only Vaccine there is, and since you would get Covid sooner or later,  ofc you should get the AZ vaccine asap."
18336,"But what if you could get another vaccine, like Pfizer/Biontech, say  1-2 months later?"
18337,Would you still take AZ right away?
18338,Depending on your age and risk of infection it *might* actually be better if you didt.
18339,"No, what you need is to vaccinate your people, not to become an authoritarian state again."
18340,thats just sad
18341,You can’t justify locking down to prevent 10-20 deaths per day out of a population of 10 million.
18342,The economical and mental health consequences massively outweigh whatever benefit those 10-20 people would bring at that point.
18343,We’re talking about an excess mortality of 3-6% as it currently stands.
18344,The daily death toll will further decrease as all the risk groups are vaccinated within the next 2 months or so.
18345,At that point we won’t have any deaths.
18346,The moral calculus favours staying open with the current excess mortality.
18347,[removed]
18348,And you’re more likely to be hit by lightning than get a blood clot from a vaccine.
18349,Nice!!

18378,"from my understanding, the longer the gap the better."
18379,Only take the second dose if you have a higher chance to get infected aka doctors.
18380,Are there any information drives going on?
18381,"Sorry, no - laughing gas is nitrous oxide (N₂O), not nitric oxide."
18382,Im pretty sure plenty rather have vaccine then catch covid
18383,"That number likely includes car accidents though which a victim caused himself/herself with driving way too fast, drunk, drugged, ignoring a red light, etc."
18384,I bet the probability of daying in a car accident is lower if you exclude victims who kind of caused their death themselves out of extreme carelessness.
18385,"“Wait, you guys are tracking?”

USA to rest of world."
18386,Reported
18387,Seems like it.
18388,The whole of Europe should reach herd immunity by July as far as plans go.
18389,"I'm very pro-vaccines and I think this vaccine should be used, but I don't get this argument."
18390,People aren't choosing between injecting themselves with the vaccine and injecting themselves with COVID.
18391,It's not an apples to apples comparison; you have to factor in both the risk of COVID causing a blood clot *and* the risk of getting COVID in the first place.
18392,"In this case, the risk of catching COVID would have to be more than 1/8; from what I can tell the total infection rate in the USA is only about 1/10 and for someone who's taking precautions like masking and distancing, it's almost certainly even less."
18393,"Just accept that there's a slightly elevated risk of blood clots with the vaccine but in most people's cases, the *overall* benefits (both to personal health and to reaching herd immunity so that life can go back to normal) outweigh the risk, and anyone who's worried should have a conversation with their own doctor about their personal risk level."
18394,We are protecting them by vaccinating the population around them.
18395,That’s the most effective seatbelt we can give them until we get vaccinations approved for their age bracket.
18396,"Masks are effective, yes, but not the way children wear them (I have literally never seen a child wear a well fitting mask), and the adverse effects of developing children missing social cues and being able to read lips if they are hard of hearing might should not be underestimated."
18397,"When we reach a certain threshold of infection in the general population, we need to reevaluate restrictions and safety measures."
18398,Who says we won’t get to that point by the fall?
18399,"How can the situation be ""dramatic"" when the number of people hospitalized and in intensive care is far below what it was in December?"
18400,"Honestly, sometimes it looks like German doctors and politicians are way more cautious than pretty much every other country in Europe when it comes to dealing with covid."
18401,"Figures about cases, hospitalizations and deaths are consistently lower than in comparable countries, yet the whole health care system seems to be constantly warning about impending collapse and the politicians act like they're about to see dead bodies pile up on the streets."
18402,"I mean, not saying they're wrong to be overly cautious, as I said it's certainly a behaviour that paid off given the overall stats, but it's still interesting to see."
18403,"Still, worrying for the mrna vaccines."
18404,Schools aren’t “closed.” The majority are now open for in person learning.
18405,"Even those few that don’t have any in person are still offering education, just remotely."
18406,"And all that aside, it doesn’t really take “energy and resources” to keep a mask policy that’s already been working fine for months in place, so keeping a mask mandate will not harm planning for next year."
18407,It’s like vaccines work or something.

18427,This is exactly the kind of thing that insurance loves to pay for.
18428,A vaccine is much cheaper for them than a ventilator or weeks in the hospital
18429,Nah.
18430,90%+ reduction (at least) in likelihood I’d be able to spread it.
18431,That’s enough for my conscience.
18432,"I’d feel bad for kids who can’t get it, but I’m not exactly hanging out with random kids."
18433,"Regardless, they are very low risk."
18434,"My wife works at a hospital in the UK as a Doctor, she said the majority of cases that come in are AZ vaccination side effects in the first 2-3 days, she has rarely seen Pfizer."
18435,"I'd take any vaccination, but if given the opportunity I'd pick Pfizer personally."
18436,A good time to be lax about covid will be next fall when that's true.
18437,"As of right now and every day for the last year, Florida has been lax without the vaccine being widely available."
18438,You seriously think you are a victim don't you?
18439,"&gt; The article says they still have to follow 6 foot distancing, so capacity is still limited by that."
18440,so.... not 100% capacity like the article headline says lol.
18441,I can quantify a lower bound on how many people’s vaccines will be delayed.
18442,The US is sitting on ~10M J&amp;J vaccines at the moment.
18443,"The CDC’s pause will now last for at least 9 days, given that ACIP declined to make a decision at their current meeting, so the earliest decision will be their next meeting 7-10 days from now."
18444,So 10 million people will be getting their vaccine 9-12 days later than they otherwise might have.
18445,What’s important here is that time is of the essence.
18446,"Even if the same number of people end up inoculated, more people will still die if inoculation is delayed."
18447,I hope you stay clear!
18448,"Honestly, it sucked, and I don't wish it on anyone."
18449,"That being said, I'm also pregnant, so I don't know how much that played into symptoms like exhaustion."
18450,It certainly affected what I could take -- tylenol only.
18451,Which pharmacy?
18452,&gt;who gives a shit.. are patents more important than lives?
18453,This.
18454,Profits before lives mentality needs to stop.

18460,BCBS sent me a bill for $180 for a covid test in December.
18461,The steroid shot and care I got when I was sick didn't cost me anything except my copay.
18462,I'll never understand how BCBS does their billing
18463,A reminder that that’s less than 1% of people who have been fully vaccinated.
18464,They should just do this in the cloud instead
18465,What are they gonna do?
18466,Put the baby back?
18467,Because the insurance company pays for the administration of the vaccine.
18468,A $50 vaccine administration fee is a lot cheaper than thousands in hospital bills.
18469,Insurance companies care about money

18475,"There may be differences in empathy between men and women, but in this case it appears that this is just an artifact of the priority groups."
18476,Aw man - I thought I was in the clear at 12 hours...
18477,Thanks for sharing.
18478,Are you doing better now?
18479,Best wishes on a speedy recovery and hopefully it doesn’t cost too much.
18480,If it’s outside of your budget happy to help with the cost.
18481,I think you mean commission lol
18482,But your opinion is very much important.
18483,I decided not to get the J&amp;J vaccine and waited for Pfizer of which the first dose I received today.
18484,I’m happy I waited and will get my second dose soon as well.
18485,We are basically saying the same thing.
18486,The difference is I'm pointing out that vaccinated adults should not live as if there isn't a large portion of our country comprised of children.
18487,Am I highlighting something unhelpful?
18488,I think it's the opposite.
18489,"Adults would do well to get vaccinated and be mindful of community spread, so that kids can do the things you mentioned, without concern, until they can get vaccinated."
18490,"My comment was responding to the earlier comment insinuating that ""everyone"" who wants to get vaccinated can by May 31st."
18491,"My point is that children are people/humans and should be thought of when making sweeping statements about ""everyone."""
18492,"They should not be excluded from the term ""everyone."""
18493,Where’s your evidence for that?
18494,I teach elementary and kids at my school wear them properly and don’t seem bothered by them at all.
18495,"They do better than most adults I know, actually."
18496,Its like saying you dont need to be vaccinated and wearing mask because the risk is low to you and its on others to be responsible and do these things instead.
18497,But they still can transmit it to adults that they live with.
18498,[removed]
18499,They absolutely cannot charge you for the vaccine.
18500,They can only charge a person’s health insurance if they have that.
18501,"No copays, administrative fees or any other type of fee."
18502,If you don’t have insurance you will not be billed for anything as well.
18503,I got mine for free at Walgreens and I don’t have insurance.

18510,[removed]
18511,Yup!
18512,Someone correct me if I'm wrong but I feel like using this percentage is kind of misleading.
18513,It sort of assumes that all those 75 million people would've gotten COVID had they not been vaccinated.
18514,I mean there have been 138 million COVID cases in the world in total (that we know of) but it would be weird to say 138 million/7.8 billion or 1.77% of people have gotten COVID (most of which were not vaccinated).
18515,That's also a small percentage but not really telling of anything.
18516,Wow.
18517,People pop tylenol like it is candy.
18518,Just curious what's the data on kids with covid spreading it to parents and grandparents
18519,"Scientists are scratching their heads over that in the UK as UK data shows the risks are 1 in 600,000"
18520,"Not a safety risk, but I also don’t think that there are absolutely zero drawbacks to doing so

Energy and resources would be much, much better dedicated to figuring out how minimize the loss of learning and other collateral damage caused to kids by public school closures for over a year"
18521,It's literal fact that women make up a higher proportion of the first two priority groups.
18522,"We may still see a gap when it's all said and done, but this huge gap is just due to the groups."
18523,"In fact, it looks like [surveys as recent as March](https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2021/03/05/growing-share-of-americans-say-they-plan-to-get-a-covid-19-vaccine-or-already-have/) indicate that more men intend to get it (72 vs 66%)."
18524,"The first shot, I had arm soreness for about 3 days."
18525,"My second shot, I didn't feel bad until about 14 hours after my shot."
18526,"I began to develop a headache, and then shortly after, full body chills."

18658,Why would you need the vaccine if you already have the antibodies?...
18659,You pay a premium every month so might as well make those fuckers pay out instead of adding to the national debt
18660,If the point of healthcare is to provide healthcare then creating a group of disadvantaged people and even hurting them goes against basic ethics.
18661,To state that as callously as you just did means you value perceived fairness over the ability of people to get actual help.
18662,More or less “so long as one is suffering then we all must suffer”.
18663,You basically admit that universal care is garbage.
18664,"To be honest that's not really a fair comparison, since the US system is fucked up."
18665,Let's look at Germany instead.
18666,In Germany you can choose public or private insurance.
18667,If you're young and healthy private insurance is cheaper and provides better care.
18668,"As you get older private insurance becomes more expensive, while how much you pay in public insurance always depends only on your income."
18669,"So yes, if you're in public insurance, you're earning a good salary, and you're healthy, you're paying much more than you should be paying because you're subsidizing other's health care."
18670,With socialized health care many people end up paying more to cover the costs of those who can't.
18671,And I think that's great by the way.

18674,"That isn't what Fauci is saying, though?"
18675,"mid twenties Jamaican, got vaccinated Monday"
18676,I don’t think hipaa will cover that.
18677,HIPAA prevents medical providers from telling others.
18678,"Your employer can in most places demand you provide medical proof to them, like a drug test or a vaccine."
18679,Another alternative for plain walking for me is a shopping mall.
18680,"Those were totally closed during the lockdowns, but opened back up in my state."
18681,"With a mask on, it was pretty easy to stay distanced from everyone."
18682,That’s a real concern.
18683,"I know the company I just joined I and a few others were hired as remotes during the pandemic with no plans on making us come to their office, but a lot of people who did work out of the office are absolutely against coming back to it and like working from home."
18684,There is only like 17% of the total office workforce looking forward to going back in.
18685,That right there should tell companies they are wasting a lot of money owning office space.
18686,"I mean, isn’t she just doing her job?"
18687,We don’t have to listen to her of course; obviously most people are over the pandemic.
18688,Her concern is the continued loss of life.
18689,"If she were silent about recommendations, she’d be failing to uphold her job responsibilities"

18692,"I didn't have anything other than a sore arm, but got pfizer 2 on monday."
18693,All day yesterday I felt crummy.
18694,Today I have a headache and am lethargic.
18695,My grandmother (who is already high-risk) already is.
18696,She's a covid denier who says that the mother of a friend of her's is on life support after getting the second dose.
18697,"I have no clue if her information is accurate, but she has definitively decided that she's never getting the vaccine now."
18698,"I mean she wasn't planning on getting it before, but now she can announce it from a soapbox."
18699,Particularly POC who have been purposely deceived in events like the Tuskegee syphilis study in which black people were given the disease and monitored without medical intervention.
18700,&gt; there will be an increase in informational ads to get people to take it.
18701,Already seeing them.
18702,Which is good.
18703,Saying that the vaccine isn't safe is going to lose public support for covid vaccines in general all the same.
18704,"In Taiwan, only 30k of 600k eligible for the first shot have taken it--AZ."
18705,"&amp;#x200B;

The media has a lot to answer for with fear-mongoring and failing to assure people that the risks are minimal."
18706,"Yeah, let people know there's a blood clot risk, sure, that is fair."
18707,"But the media have, by and large, failed to point out that there's more risk of been hit by a car than getting a blood clot."
18708,"&amp;#x200B;

It's par the course, though."
18709,The media has been a disgrace throughout.
18710,I remember when they caused panic buying by plastering pictures of a handful of empty shelves all over the front pages.
18711,I am not a doctor or anything but the reports of the blood clots from the J&amp;J vaccine were all 6-13 days after the vaccine.
18712,"5 weeks later, according to this, you should be fine."
18713,Fucking hell that blows.
18714,I'm getting my second Pfizer shot next week.
18715,I couldn't imagine waiting another 6 months.
18716,[deleted]
18717,Don’t help that places like CVS and Walgreens give the impression it’s not by requesting your insurance.
18718,"Question: when do you guys think the attitude will shift from ""this is a deadly disease, we have to contain it"" to "" you assume the risk, if you wanna die too bad"" because the us is getting to the point where there is more supply then demand"
18719,[deleted]
18720,That’s hilarious.
18721,Welcome to socialized medicine.
18722,Isn't it beautiful?
18723,Sit back and have a donut :)
18724,"It’s not stored centrally, on a federal level, in a way the app could reach it."
18725,That’s why places like the ALCU are advocating for a far more accessible plan should governments take a route like this.
18726,"&gt;If someone would rather stay inside for a couple of months instead of taking the AZ vaccine, they should also rethink whether they'd want to go out at all when the pandemic is over."
18727,I've got steady remote work and lots of solo hobbies.
18728,"It's been hard staying at home, but if a few months gets me a vaccine with slightly less risk, why wouldn't I?"
18729,It's not like anything is gonna be open for me to enjoy for the next few months anyways.
18730,I mean... it’s both with B-cells as well
18731,Yes there are trade-offs.
18732,Universal healthcare is still obviously better at a societal level.
18733,There is going to be a group of people disadvantaged or even hurt by a proposed reform.
18734,Pointing that out isn’t by itself an argument against the proposed reform
18735,I had 2nd shot at noon yesterday.
18736,I feel asleep hard around 4 pm for 2 hours.
18737,Then woke up this morning feeling like I had a hangover.
18738,My migraine got worse and I took 2 Advil this afternoon and now feel pretty much fine.
18739,My arm is still pretty sore.
18740,It's been close to a decade and we still get stories about that goddamned Malaysian plane.
18741,More like five decades than five years.
18742,Is it?
18743,What numbers you running to get significance there?
18744,[removed]
18745,A more relevant poll would only ask those who haven’t been vaccinated yet.
18746,One of those Thermometer you put to your forehead.
18747,That’s how we do our pre-work screenings
18748,but...the gene therapy 😂 😂 😂
18749,[deleted]
18750,They charge your insurance for the administration costs.
18751,But you can still get it if you don’t have any
18752,I think the difference is that we know *why* they happen with contraception.
18753,We know blood clots happen with AZ but not why.
18754,So you're denying the CDC results?
18755,Airlines are already hygienic enough?
18756,"I think this is a good point, lots of preventative healthcare is advertised as free like annual physicals."
18757,However the doctor may order tests or talk about things that are not preventative and that physical is so longer free.
18758,Likewise a colonoscopy when you're 50 is free unless they find something.
18759,This is a big problem in healthcare and it leads to avoiding doctors until you get to the ER.
18760,So europe highly unlikely to be normal this year?
18761,Wanted to go to yacht week this year in Croatia
18762,"As a Floridian with kids in school, I'm happy we had mask mandates this year but I'm thrilled they won't next year."
18763,At some point our kids deserve true normalcy.
18764,They recoup some of the administrative costs is my understanding.
18765,"Anyone not insured, they eat that cost, but if they can pass something to insurance they will."
18766,But I 100% agree that it creates an unintentional perceived barrier.
18767,Actually this topic is on the vaccine waiver forms so it’s a pretty straight forward one to answer.
18768,You can’t have any other vaccines within 14 days either direction of the covid vaccine.
18769,Reason?
18770,Got mine this morning.
18771,Can’t wait until 6 weeks from now
18772,Well if you don't sow oats how will plants rise.
18773,Yup.
18774,You need to have 14 days between vaccines.
18775,"According to the official numbers, yeah."
18776,"But these numbers represent only a fraction of the true infection count, especially in a poorer nation like India."
18777,"Not saying that what’s happening in India isn’t horrific, and would continue to go on for quite a while if we didn’t have a vaccine campaign underway."
18778,But what’s the point of making up scary estimates based on numbers we know for a fact are inaccurate?
18779,Go to a local pharmacy.
18780,Much easier with less traffic.
18781,"there is no central system between chain pharmacies, between urgent clinics, FEMA has a separate system too"
18782,There needs to be metrics in place for when this can happen to try and encourage people to get vaccinated.
18783,Did they happen to be given any let us say...privileges for ~~advertising~~ prescribing to you?
18784,He/she is saying people forget to cancel their appointment which means someone else can’t get it on that day/time.
18785,It just pushes other people out further than it would had the first person cancelled.
18786,Honestly: I wouldn’t.
18787,You already have a good amount of immunity after one shot.
18788,It’s not worth the risk for another shot that gives you another 5% immunity.
18789,In the US sure.
18790,"In most of the world Pfizer vaccines don't grow on fucking trees, we have the AZ and whatever scraps of Pfizer than US are willing to send us (practically nothing) and grinding the whole vaccination program to a halt until they're available is a delay of minimum 6+ months for the lucky countries and even more for the ones further down the queue."
18791,I think it’s for women on hormonal birth control specifically.
18792,It’s still a pretty small number but it’s hard to not worry.
18793,Best thing to do is know the symptoms and call dr as soon as she experiences them.
18794,It happens like up to 13 days after vaccinations or something.
18795,I watched dr John Campbell on YouTube about it this morning.
18796,He has all the info.
18797,Thanks for the response.
18798,What is the issue with second doses?
18799,"For the two dose vaxxes in the USA, you make your appointment for the second dose, while you’re getting the first."
18800,"It’s only 3 weeks separation, on those."
18801,I guess we’re just lucky with how it’s being rolled out?
18802,"If the center seats are left empty, the airlines will need to fly more flights, and pilots will have full employment."
18803,"If supply does not meet demand,  the airlines can raise prices."
18804,How much tax money went to bail out airlines?
18805,I think the airlines owe the country a lot for the bailout.
18806,The least they can do is help end the pandemic sooner and keep the center seat empty.
18807,Reducing Covid exposure on flights is a big win for the country.
18808,Then you’d better report them immediately
18809,But businesses can still have a mask mandate.
18810,"We don't have a statewide mask mandate but grocery stores, Target, etc still require them."
18811,It's not enforced but if there is a sign most people will comply.
18812,I'm wondering when businesses will stop requesting them.
18813,And where they weren't banned they were shown to be a huge disease vector.
18814,This isn't a thing.
18815,The overwhelming majority of restaurants can't be filled to 100% capacity and have everyone consistently six feet apart.
18816,I don't know I'm steering clear of this AstraZeneca.
18817,Have you missed the news that JnJ has been having issues with blood clotting too?
18818,People don’t realize that the net cost to the system would likely be lower if everyone had access to medical care.
18819,What do you think costs more?
18820,"Proving preventive care for someone before they get really sick, or an ambulance ride, ER visit, and hospital stay for something that could’ve been prevented?"
18821,And idiots will say “well I don’t think I should have to pay more for other peoples care!” 1.
18822,You’re a monster and 2. Who do you think the costs for all those people who can’t pay get passed on to?
18823,"You know, those same people racking up huge bills when they eventually get really sick rather than the cost being an occasional trip to the doctor and an antibiotic."
18824,That people have to wear “don’t take me on the ambulance” bracelets because it would literally bankrupt them is disgusting and makes me ashamed of my country for allowing this to persist.
18825,It's to give the opportunity to bill the government buttttt if you do have insurance they can bill them lol
18826,my guess is you don't know how trade works between underdeveloped countries and developed ones
18827,Vaccines have to be the end.
18828,"Good thing is in the US we are fairly open, just need to push on the masks after vaccinations."
18829,Does this vaccine prevent catching covid entirely?
18830,"I was under the understanding that it still might be possible to spread it, which makes your statement true regardless of whether the under 40 woman gets vaccinated."
18831,I mean it's entirely possible for mRNA vaccines too any any... it's possible but not plausible that there will be further complications.
18832,Congestion is less common with COVID and a loss of smell can be consistent with other respiratory viruses that cause congestion.
18833,A test would be the only way to be sure though.
18834,Some tests check for flu at the same time but I'm not sure how you arrange for that.
18835,Someone who understand Bayesian thinking!
18836,They’re not closed in Montreal and a third of our new cases are caused by schools so clearly they’re not safe enough
18837,Agreed
18838,I wonder how far private businesses can take their new found freedoms.
18839,How far are they willing to discriminate in your eyes?
18840,"While it may work, I can see some unintended consequences like shoving out certain voting blocs from stores across america."
18841,Like say based on how you voted making you sign a waiver (gun store in michigan already did this (at least making you say you did not vote for joe biden))
18842,It wiped out a significant portion of the population and caused the average life expectancy to drop 12 years
18843,Yes.
18844,HIPAA should cover that.
18845,You might run into a problem if your employer decides to require everyone to get the vaccine.
18846,The vaccine cards have a date on them.
18847,I though it was 2 weeks after the first shot of Pfizer...
18848,I mean you should consult your doctor about this sort of thing.
18849,If they told you not to take a vaccine then fair enough.
18850,If you're making medical decisions based on 'what you think is right' then you need to get your head out of your arse and go see your doctor.
18851,"No, they're brown!"
18852,Send them to my first world country!!!
18853,/s
18854,"From the article 

That means governors must weigh what the public would be willing to do as they consider how to respond to a resurgence of cases fueled by the new variants."
18855,Basically how will it affect there re-election bid.
18856,"That's not true though, they commanded air circulation studies in all schools (albeit late), mandatory surgical mask, one day out of two remote for high school, class bubbles and now they're all closed in the red zones."
18857,[removed]
18858,"To date, I believe the oldest case of thrombosis-thrombocytopenia
reported was 54, the median age was 30 something."
18859,"It seems that younger immune systems are more likely to over-react than older people's immune systems, and even for the young the risk is very low, for the elderly it seems to be effectively zero."
18860,The UK have vaccinated literally millions of the elderly and did not find any of those cases in the 60+ age group.
18861,Your grandma will be fine.
18862,https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2104882
18863,"that is still 37% is the category of no, only if forced, and hesitant."
18864,That is way to big yet and we won't get to herd immunity with those numbers.
18865,Bee stings kill way more people on first injection per year.
18866,Ban bees immediately.
18867,"It makes sense that they are waiting the amount of time it’s going to take for that issue to show up for the majority of people who got the shot (since it rolled out on a larger scale last week), but as a person in the demographic group that got the vaccine this is going to be a long two weeks."
18868,"I have worked a hybrid schedule since March 2020, was 3 days remote 2 in office."
18869,Now 2 remote 3 in office.
18870,My boss said this will be permanent so I’m satisfied!
18871,About time!
18872,The same thing happened to my mum despite having no other health conditions.
18873,"She was told it had nothing to do with the vaccine, but I do wonder if the scale of the problem is being underestimated."
18874,[deleted]
18875,"What chaos, a lot of people will die as a result of this."
18876,It will have global consequences.
18877,"If we see large parts of the global south shun AZ/J&amp;J because of vaccine hesitancy induced by western health officials making decisions for western audiences, it will take far longer to vaccinate said populations which means more direct death from covid in those countries but also increases the chance of new mutations appearing which may undermine the western world as well."
18878,"I think the costs to suspending a vaccine are really quite under-estimated by some regulators, and are much more far reaching than they may expect."
18879,Atleast in my circle it sadly does.
18880,"Most have been complete corona deniers since it started, and this going into their anti-vax agenda definetely isnt helping at all."
18881,"I dont get how they see a 1-3% chance of death like a total joke that doesnt exist, but the 1 in 40000?"
18882,chance of issues as the biggest terror there is.
18883,Not so sure about that.
18884,"Majority of us in my country who got the first dose of Astra Zeneca had no history of covid infection (regular RT-PCR and ECLIA monitoring), yet experienced the severe side effects of chills, fever, malaise, anorexia/nausea and body pains."
18885,I think it's in the nature of the vaccine as an adenoviral vector.
18886,The free tests are not in offices.
18887,A link for what?
18888,Pfizer denies this finding and it is stated in the article.
18889,It will be interesting to see who is “right”.
18890,Oxford has too much skin in the game for me to trust this until it has been peer reviewed.
18891,Finally eligible here in WA and scheduled my first shot of Pfizer for Wednesday!!
18892,So excited for all this to be done with
18893,"I mean, everyone got measles shots before anti vaxxers, or rather a huge portion of our population."
18894,We got rid of measles in 2000 in the US.
18895,But it made a resurgence.
18896,"When they say the number needed for herd immunity, they're pretty accurate."
18897,"So if they say we need 70%, and 50% of our population gets the shots, that's 170 million people still unvaccinated, and they will spread Covid."
18898,"Plenty get flu shots every year, and flus still around."
18899,Even on good years where the shot is 60% effective.
18900,They aren’t close to the same thing.
18901,"Also, masks aren’t the norm while belts are, people want to go back to the norm."
18902,Hiding behind a mask will never be the preferred method.
18903,"People will do it because it helps right now, but most people want it over with."
18904,I still find it funny to run across people with make fantasies.
18905,"[this site has a lot of collections on covid and the vaccines](https://curatemyshlf.com/home) from a community of scientists and experts in the field

crazy that people don't look at the science and the facts"
18906,"Maybe, there are still two really good vaccines and people in the fence were going to find any excuse the could to convince themselves not to be vaccinated"
18907,Agreed.
18908,Why is everyone acting like their cousin Dennis created the vaccine and he really needs the money?
18909,I’m not disagreeing.
18910,It is weird but necessary as a last-step restriction removal since wearing one doesn’t affect economic output (as opposed to keeping stuff closed until mask mandates are lifted).
18911,"All for vaccines, but this doesn’t hold up."
18912,Why risk it when there are alternatives that do not cause blood clots?
18913,Yes!!
18914,!
18915,Whoosh yourself lol
18916,"Yup, your logic is sound."
18917,Ignore the idiots
18918,"Sure yeah, but he's not an MD, PhD"
18919,From what I read yes.
18920,The mRNA vaccines are simply the best by far.
18921,[deleted]
18922,It is optional for everyone.
18923,"And if you opt out, you don't deserve to get rewarded for it by getting to use PTO."
18924,Makes sense to me.
18925,We also will have the benefit of a high uptake percentage by the time all is said and done.
18926,"Canadians like to complain about our provincial health care, but we *trust* it."

18928,"In the context of a global pandemic with a scarcity of vaccines, I can get not giving a choice, because there may not be enough vaccines to give it."
18929,But refusing to tell people what they're going to get?
18930,"That reeks of paternalism to me, it's a disgrace that democratic countries are doing that kind of thing."
18931,"There have been 645,412 recorded Covid deaths on the EU+EEA (combined population of roughly 453 million)."
18932,3 weeks made me think pfizer vaccine but I could be wrong.
18933,So far the mRNA vaccines have proven effective against every variant currently in circulation.
18934,Boosters are already in development.
18935,Vaccine escape isn't something to panic about at the moment.
18936,You have no clue how science academics work have you?
18937,I mean with other vaccines available.... AstraZeneca should be given to those with low clot risk..
18938,CBS changed the title.
18939,Just read the article
18940,"One year yes, this one is also uncertain and given all these ""scary"" news of everlasting emergence of variants, I wouldn't be surprised if this shit will continue indefinitely."
18941,"I think that choosing to ""pause"" over ""safety concerns"" was a terrible unforced error by the authorities."
18942,"They were already concerned about people refusing or delaying vaccination and planning on J&amp;J for ""underserved"" demographics and then they just do something that confirms people's suspicion that the vaccines have not been proven safe and that J&amp;J vaccine is somehow inferior to Pfizer and Moderna..."
18943,Denmark and Norway projects that you will have more death by using AstraZeneca than not using it.
18944,"This due to low death rates by the virus, increasing supply of mRNA vaccines and very slow deliveries by AstraZeneca."
18945,For countries with higher death rates and less access to mRNA vaccines it becomes a entirely different calculation.
18946,Why in three months?
18947,Is there a shortage of the Pfizer one?
18948,I just got it and now I'm worried they won't have it for my follow up in 21 days.
18949,My husband and I still talk about this movie.
18950,Completely forgotten by time.

18952,"&gt;During a meeting with district laboratories in Maharashtra last week, the National Institute of Virology (NIV) shared limited data showing a break-up of 361 genome-sequenced samples collected between January and March this year."
18953,The headline finding from the analysis: the presence of a double mutation was detected in 220 — almost 61 per cent — of the samples.
18954,This double variant was last week classified as the “B.1.617” variant.
18955,THE VACCINE IS SAFE DO NOT QUESTION THE GOVERNMENT CARRY ON
18956,Significant numbers?
18957,I don't know what qualifies as significant numbers.
18958,"However, I can speak to the community I pastor."
18959,We haven't had a service in over a year and have a very high vaccination rate among our people already.
18960,"That said, we have probably 15-20% of our congregation that has said they would not attend a service if masks were not mandated in September."
18961,"To me, that's a significant number and I do think it's largely due to increased anxiety and stress from the trauma of the past year."
18962,"I consider myself to have been very responsible throughout the pandemic, however at this point if we had a private service (for only the people in our church) I don't think I'd require masks."
18963,Encourage?
18964,Sure.
18965,But the reality is that 80+% vaccination + those who have had Covid + the cleaning/distancing protocols we have in place make me think its extremely low risk.
18966,"Regardless, for 15-20% of our church, low risk isn't enough."
18967,"They want ""no risk"""
18968,"There is an article on Danish news site nyheder.tv2.dk right now, that the government is considering this."
18969,Edit: https://nyheder.tv2.dk/samfund/2021-04-15-regeringen-vil-undersoege-muligheden-for-at-give-danskerne-frit-valg-om
18970,"The chances of getting a blood clot from the vaccine are roughly 1 in 1,000,000."
18971,Then you'd need to work out your risk of being hospitalised/dying if you caught covid in the first place.
18972,"Under 30 the risk of that happening is slightly lower than the vaccine, over 30 it isn't and rises pretty quickly"
18973,It was also like the first activity occurring in months.
18974,"Spring 2020 was pretty strict lockdowns, then in June the protests happened and I know of a lot of people who went to protests simply for something to do out of the house... which sounds awful but in my city they were protests not riots so they were safe, and they were large social gatherings, and people were cooped up bored but wanted out of the house."
18975,"Like my cities protests was hosted by our mayor etc., it was definitely viewed as a protest/community event kind of thing by a lot of people."
18976,🤷‍♀️
18977,[deleted]
18978,What a ridiculous take.
18979,Wow.
18980,You ever met anyone who liked wearing seat belts?
18981,"Again, it's a mild inconvenience even in a worst case scenario."
18982,"I just don't get the ""I refuse to be mildly inconvenienced for any reason"" thing."
18983,Safe is a relative term.
18984,"Without any vaccines, there is a good chance your son is safe."
18985,Unvaccinated children may very well be at significantly lower risk than fully vaccinated older adults.
18986,Add in the fact that you are vaccinated and the people you are visiting likely have natural immunity  I personally would find that situation very safe.
18987,But there is always some level of risk.
18988,I can only comment on what I was told while getting the Pfizer vaccine.
18989,little over 50% after 2 weeks on the initial dose and then up to 95% after 2 weeks on the last dose.
18990,May not be accurate but this is what I was told while literally sitting down getting injected.
18991,And they just give you two doses of the same vaccine.
18992,So there isn’t a part A and Part B. It’s the same one injected twice about a month apart.
18993,"Oh okay, I didn't know if there was actually something to the 1000 number or you were just making a point"
18994,Thanks you!
18995,Didn't they study the mRNA shots and came to the conclusion even if you get 1 shot it offers about the same protection as J&amp;J does?
18996,"Plus, most people if anything have an immune response reaction after the second shot."
18997,Plus they really seem to have streamlined shots well.
18998,"I've been to a few different sites taking family, friends and we all were in and out in 20 minutes."
18999,The waiting period was the longest part of the whole process.
19000,Drink lots of water and stay hydrated
19001,How many shot will someone have to take a year to stay up to date?
19002,"There strong evidence that covid will become endemic, similar to the flu."
19003,[Nature paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00396-2)
19004,"One key factor I understand is that although the J&amp;J and AZ are less effective, they’re just as effective at preventing serious illness as the others."
19005,"Given that it’s a high probability this will become an endemic virus like the flu that won’t really ever go away, isn’t it best to protect the population from serious illness/death?"
19006,This is what I’ve gathered from what I’ve read so please let me know if there’s a better approach as I haven’t found a great article/source explaining it from both angles I mention.
19007,Thanks.
19008,"You're absolutely right, but you're not addressing the underlying problem here."
19009,"The real problem here is that everybody knows this, but the situation is intentionally being made profoundly political, so that the general mental reaction to the topic of vaccines turns to, ""ugh, all everyone talks about is politics."""
19010,Just like they did with climate change.
19011,"The fundamental issue is that modern political discourse is clouded by dishonesty, not ignorance."
19012,Would you rather look at the percentage of the world population that have died of covid or maybe your state or county?
19013,Bet you a nickle its higher then this vaccines chance of hurting you.
19014,"You also get to be part of the population that doesn't go around spreading pestilence, doesn't that sound nice?"
19015,Not killing people :)
19016,so is the vaccine basically a dummed down version of the virus?
19017,it would explain all the similiar-symptoms it gives and the risk of clots that develop
19018,"I think the thing that makes this all a non-issue for me is that the rate of occurrence is statistically insignificant, and I mean that in a very direct interpretation of the term."
19019,"The last figure I saw/heard was that six individuals had been identified with blood clots that could be attributed to the vaccine, out of about 7 million people vaccinated with it."
19020,That puts the rate of incidence at about 0.00009%.
19021,"Honestly, I think I took on about as much risk, if not more, when I crossed the street this morning to get to work from my car."
19022,"I get the whole “minimizing risk” argument, but this one is in the category of things that are lower-risk than activities the average person already chooses to do voluntarily with the assumption of relative safety, like crossing the street, or driving to work, or even just spending an afternoon out in the sun (12.7 cases of melanoma per 100,000 people, or a 0.0127% chance; 141 times more likely than a vaccine-related blood clot)."
19023,"Yes, there’s a “chance”."
19024,But it’s about as good as your odds of winning the lottery; maybe even less (depending which one you play).
19025,Anybody reading this on the toilet is probably at higher risk to their health due to sitting and having bad posture than they would be of getting a clot after vaccination.
19026,[deleted]
19027,"I'm in a place where the P1 variant has taken hold, and would likely not be able to get vaccinated until early June."
19028,"The news I see is a mix of optimism over the vaccine rollout (particularly in The United States) and pessimism over the spread of P1, B1351, and B117 that could overwhelm the hospitals."
19029,"I've been fortunate enough to work from home, so I'm so much worried about contracting Covid as I am having the virus mutate to a point where current vaccines almost become moot and we're back where we were last year."
19030,How does everyone here feel about where the world is now in the vaccine vs variant race?
19031,How much of what is seen on social media is legitimate concern and how much is excessive alarmism?
19032,This is Reddit in a nutshell.
19033,This website is fucking garbage to be honest.
19034,The whole “Reddit hive mind” is a joke and quite literally made up of edgy stay at home low income losers.
19035,&gt; My suggestion?
19036,"Pick a date, and stick to it."
19037,"June 15th, I don’t know."
19038,"Far enough away that it appeases the overly risk averse, but it must be stuck to."
19039,"Regardless what happens, on June 15th, masks are no longer mandates, no more social distancing, 100% capacity everywhere."
19040,"Covid is over, June 15th."
19041,Or something like that.
19042,"I believe someone in a very high profile position tried that last year, and it failed miserably."
19043,"Of course, that was prior to vaccine rollouts."
19044,Whatever date is chosen should use a metrics-based approach and not just arbitrarily picked.
19045,Lmao!
19046,I know it's free.
19047,Just don't want it 🤷‍♂️
19048,Once formed of course not but as prophylaxis
19049,Got Pfizer 2 yesterday.
19050,"I’m definitely feeling off-not bed bound, but a little hazy, tired, and mild motion sickness when I stand up and walk around."
19051,Wondering if I should go to work this afternoon or just stay home in case it gets worse.
19052,I can answer that without any medical degree.
19053,Everyone get the vaccine now regardless of maker.
19054,Everything else is fucking bullshit from the hamster wheel powered brain of some idiot who didn't know how viruses worked in the first place.
19055,"The only correct response is ""Get your shot"""
19056,Congrats!
19057,"I honestly had a harder time so far with the first shot than the second, but both shots have been easier than when I had covid last October."
19058,Hopefully everyone that’s holding out will go get stuck so we can move on from this nightmare.
19059,"But on the flip side, the older age groups that were prone to greater risks for severe outcomes are now being vaccinated, reducing the risk for younger age group pools as the greater population gets vaccinated."
19060,"So for younger people, it may never make sense to take vaccines that present risk of blood clotting."
19061,"Variants will continue to resurface causing localized outbreaks, not unlike the flu."
19062,There is some speculation that if COVID remains endemic in some parts of the world (like polio) that if you are a frequent traveler you'll probably want to consider a booster shot against the most prevalent variants every year.
19063,I love it too.
19064,"I read an article about the guy who created it and he seems like such an awesome person, he's spent so much time on it without getting anything in return."
19065,He agreed to take some donations to help cover website fees but the rest he donates to pandemic relief.

19074,This is what boggles my mind.
19075,This article is written to SCARE people.
19076,There is literally 0 context.
19077,"it just says ""SEE!!"
19078,"People STILL get sick even with the vaccine!!"""
19079,"even though it's not even a statistical relevant number... .0072% of vaccinated got infected, and of THAT 7% go to the hospital?"
19080,Seriously?
19081,"Also know that in some states, even if you are only eligible starting on the 19th, you can still pre-schedule a vaccine appointment for after the 19th right now!"
19082,"So be sure to check if you can do that in your state or city, because you might be able to schedule today event if you’re not eligible today"
19083,"Who said ""absolute faith""?"
19084,"I'm not the one saying that we can get rid of this, with vaccines or otherwise."
19085,"But please, go ahead and explain your plan for isolating every human on the planet long enough to eliminate it in humans (pay special attention to how to do it in places where people have to work every day to eat that night, please), and then go ahead and explain your plan to eliminate it in all the animals we know are reservoirs, plus the ones we know likely could be (which is dozens - at least)."

19090,zuckerberg belongs in jail for all the misinformation he has spread and all the lies.
19091,"If the other person is fully vaccinated, extremely safe."
19092,Unless one of you is at particularly high risk i would feel fine doing that.
19093,Two weeks after Easter.
19094,There seems to be a trend with infection numbers spiking in the weeks after gathering-oriented holidays.
19095,"I wear masks because it’s asked of me but I doubt the majority of people *like* wearing masks, so that’s why they don’t."
19096,It’s not complicated.
19097,"Also, 14 days isn’t a magic threshold for building immunity."
19098,"If people are getting vaccinated and then promptly dropping all precautions after this “14 days to freedom” waiting period I’ve seen circulating online, they’re asking for trouble."
19099,That’s the unbelievable part of Star Trek for you?
19100,That’s not their job lol
19101,"&gt; As long as every patient knows what to expect, that's OK."
19102,"Here in Finland it is not always told what the vaccine is, and there have been some cases where people just pop up to ask what is ""in the menu"" and walk away if they do not like it, or they have later heard that they have received the ""wrong"" vaccine and have been angry about it."
19103,But it has been changing.
19104,"I think that even when there are no options, the receiver should be openly told beforehand what vaccine they are getting."
19105,"And as we move on, we get more situations where the vaccine can be chosen from multiple options, which I think is great as well."
19106,My vaccination consent forms mentioned 14 days after your last negative test.
19107,That isn’t a vaccine passport.
19108,A passport is a document you carry on your person to allow you to go from place to place.
19109,"It’s not a page from your medical records that your doctor faxes to your kid’s school

High school diplomas, college degrees, job offers, leases, deeds, etc."

19112,[removed]
19113,Like honestly they don't have to get it then?
19114,If they get the first two doses and don't want a third thats only really hurting themselves imo.
19115,"I don't see a reason for a booster to be ""mandated"" or whatever

Based off Israel's numbers its not looking like boosters are required to end the pandemic, just a high enough percentage of vaccinated individuals."
19116,"I have my second shot scheduled in 3 weeks, congrats on getting yours!"
19117,Even the first shot alone was such a relief for me.

19121,"I should have said ""almost covers."""
19122,"Everywhere outside of US is still waiting for their ordered vaccines, 
and that's really not part of this equation anyway."
19123,It's risk Vs reward.
19124,"Take Italy which now has the worst death rate in Europe, their reward would be exceptionally high, early adoption in the UK has been accredited for saving thousands of lives."
19125,"For others it's a trickier question, but with how well the AZ vaccine works at preventing hospitalisations (better than Pfizer currently) then it should be allowed for all over 40's imho."
19126,Covid will become [endemic](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00396-2)
19127,Correct.
19128,"If no testing was done prior to his COVID infection to detect their protein S deficiency, you can't assume COVID caused the protein S deficiency."
19129,"I think a lot of cases of a health event occurring after a person's infection with COVID are going to be poorly tied to COVID, even though these events would have occurred without COVID."
19130,"Yeah, I realized with your reply that you weren't making an anti-vax point."
19131,Same team :)
19132,"That's a pretty simple thing to find out, but it would take a lot of work."
19133,"You'd pretty much have to go day by day, look at the number of vaccinated people infected vs non vaccinated, then adjust for the relative % of the population."
19134,I.E.
19135,"if say 100 nonvax are infected and 2 Vaxxed are, but vaxxed make up %25 you'd have to multiply by 4."
19136,"Then you can say infection is at a 2:25 rate, which would be 92% effective."
19137,"You'd do this for every day and then average it all together, but I don't know what the best way to find that would be, but I'm sure math people know."
19138,"If it's just you two you're already pretty safe, the other person cant get infected and he cant infect you"

19146,"Overall vaccine hesitancy keeps slowly drifting down (even after the J&amp;J pause), so 80% adults vaxed is a possibility by mid June."
19147,Only if we actually incentivized people to actually get the vaccine.
19148,The next stimulus check (if we ever get one) should 100% be tied to having been vaccinated.
19149,Thanks
19150,Where do people come up with this shit?
19151,Lol.
19152,Sorry for the downvotes--it's probably in part because there are a lot of people throwing out bad-faith arguments on here.
19153,It's often hard to tell them apart from people with genuine concerns.
19154,Edit: And to your point--the vaccines are older than that.
19155,Moderna entered rigorous clinical trials in March *2020*.
19156,"And mRNA technology, used by Pfizer and Moderna, has been under development since the 1990s."
19157,Same applies here.
19158,Small sample size from medical professionals.
19159,That's a completely different demographic comped to 1.000.000 from the general public
19160,I will never fully recover from it.
19161,"The vomitting and nausea took 3-4 days to subside and 2-3 weeks to completely disappear, but my sense of balance will never be the same."
19162,I was an avid runner before and now when I run my balance is just kind of off and weird at times.
19163,Same thing even happens sometimes when I walk.
19164,"It has improved exponentially over the 2 1/2 months since my initial vertigo bout, I am probably going to marginally effected by it for the rest of my life."
19165,And that is on top of being 100% deaf out of my left ear.
19166,I have a hard time determining what direction sound is coming from since I can only hear out of one ear and it can make me kind of disoriented.
19167,"There are hearing aids that might help, but the reviews for them are definitely underwhelming because all they do is use a microphone to transfer sound from my left ear to my right ear, so I still can't tell what direction the sound is coming from."
19168,"There is a possible surgical solution but it costs $20,000 and I would need a $5000-$8000 device that needs replaced every few years because the batteries are built into and they eventually need replaced."
19169,"According to Bloomberg's tracker, the US has surpassed the UK in terms of doses given per capita."
19170,Easter of 2020
19171,Hi this is my favorite time to mention that everyone should be getting a titer for MMR.
19172,I am 35 and have had 2 tigers done for MMR and both have come back showing I was no longer considered immune.
19173,Turns out the mumps vaccine actually doesnt last THAT long (I am a more extreme case) if you are in your 40s or older you are most likely no longer vaccinated.
19174,You don’t get it.
19175,"This is not really about personal choice, it’s about government policy on how, who and when the vaccine should be used"
19176,The way we answer questions like this is to look at what other viruses in the same family do.
19177,Coronaviruses that have been with humans for a long time cause the common cold.
19178,Not how it works.
19179,"Vaccines are great at protecting a population, but poor at protecting any particular individual if the disease is still rampant within the population."
19180,"Vaccines are like a seat belt and airbags, it's great to have them if you get into a crash, but you would be best off by not getting into a crash in the first place."
19181,[removed]
19182,No but Russia and China are using the same technology as az and jj.
19183,This thing is a lot more political than people realize.
19184,Does Russia and China even have the capability to produce mRNA vaccines?
19185,Looks like Pfizer and moderna are going to corner the world market.
19186,Where you guys are at I doubt you ever use any of your AZ's time to ship them out
19187,Two case series?
19188,Where is the peer reviewed population level data analysis that led to AZ vaccine being suspended and/or restricted?
19189,"It's not what the CEO's are doing, it's what the media is doing."
19190,Read the article of this post and you'll see it's media speculation off what the guy said.
19191,He simply said they are planning in case it turns out that these boosters are something that is needed.
19192,"They'd rather be prepared to have to make a 3rd booster, instead of finding out it's necessary and they didn't plan for it"
19193,Great analogy.
19194,I like how this is not talked about on Reddit.
19195,"Eu didn’t invest nearly as much into researching and developing the vaccine, and now are crying “it shouldn’t be first come first serve”."
19196,Maybe instead of criticizing the USA you should have emphasized research and development.
19197,it probably will be mandatory.
19198,your argument is not solid.
19199,I want to see rate of transmission numbers.
19200,"The “misleading post” says the vaccines aren’t FDA approved, and quotes the FDA, who also says they are not FDA approved."
19201,There is more evidence than not that shows the vaccine stops transmission.
19202,"Whenever you want lol
Your a free person"
19203,I’ve had cancer.
19204,I currently have cancer.
19205,Covid will kill me
19206,Because you're not supposed to take them off and put them back on all day.
19207,You're supposed to do it once and leave them.
19208,If you touch them you should wash your hands before you touch the clean mask and after you touch the dirty mask.
19209,Messaging has been poor but Seattle is doing it correctly by the sounds of things.
19210,Poland gets it.
19211,The thing I haven't seen any studies on is the effectiveness of the mRNA vaccines 4/5/6 weeks post first dose but with no second dose.
19212,Right now comparing 3 weeks post first dose versus 2 one post second dose is not an apples to apples comparison since more time has elapsed since the first dose.
19213,"While its likely some of the increased efficacy comes from the second dose, some might also come from just waiting longer post first dose."
19214,Unfortunately due to the dosing schedules its impossible to differentiate.
19215,"lol, there are billions who will buy booster even though pandemic will be over."
19216,this is what capitalism does.
19217,there is demand and you supply and milking the vaccine what already almost paid by taxpayers.
19218,what a coincidental circle.
19219,[removed]
19220,That’s not the point.
19221,Scientists who are completely invested in the science know nothing about public policy or how to deal with unscientific people.
19222,"They assume that people think the same way as they do, which to me, is a different kind of stupid as well."
19223,When your leaders decide so.
19224,"My friend has been back to normal since  the end of May, and their county has no difference in cases vs the locked down counties of similar sizes."
19225,Meanwhile other counties that have opened since then are doing a bit worse.
19226,"So at this point it just comes down to when your community/state/country leaders decide, because as of now the results vary as to what a good metric is to reopen"
19227,Yea and flu shots get taken by like 45-60% of population.
19228,Even with some places of work making them mandatory basically and also giving them to kids
19229,Yeah this seems more akin to being new vaccines to combat emerging variants.
19230,"Calling them"" booster shots"" is dangerously misleading."
19231,I would have him take a fever reducing medicine.
19232,If his fever breaks with medicine it's likely not serious.
19233,Good luck smuggling the mom out.
19234,I want to kidnap my free rider 50 yr brother.
19235,I watched the video and my question is in what way is it misleading?
19236,At the end he does get into his opinions/conspiracy theories but what he says leading up to that is true.
19237,He basically said exactly what you commented.
19238,Well it also says Moderna is working on a universal flu vaccine and are talking about combining it with a variant-targeting upgraded Covid vaccine booster in one.
19239,"Hey, what's wrong with stay at home low income losers?"
19240,Oh that's scary but only cause I have pnh and may actually be at high risk
19241,He’s taking it already but according to what I know above 103 is the danger zone and I’m trying to be proactive since 102.2 isn’t far from it.
19242,"Maybe he had a different first date in his head for some reason, even though you said it right?"

19249,Humanity is more important than intellectual property right now.
19250,I don’t really see how any country could ever get 100% of its population vaccinated.
19251,And there’s of course the .0000019 percent chance or whatever you can still die with it.
19252,So I doubt deaths will ever be 0 forever anywhere for long that isn’t an isolated island nation constantly locking down.
19253,"Given this, I’m ready for the media to call slight increases “spikes” or “spirals” at the earliest provocation."
19254,"They were trying it earlier today, framing rare breakthrough cases as “5800 got covid anyways!"

19260,The Norwegian public health institute now recommends dropping the AstraZeneca vaccine.
19261,"Politicians may discuss the possibility of offering it to volunteers, but it looks like AZ, and possibly J&amp;J, are dead in Norway."
19262,Our infection rate is low enough that the risk of catching Covid and dying seems to be considerably less than the risk of dying from vaccine complications.
19263,They estimate that a woman in her 40s will have to wait \~1.5 *years* before taking the AZ vaccine theoretically is better than waiting.
19264,We likely won't have to wait that long on supply of alternative vaccines.
19265,"Overall, AstraZeneca has been a complete mess, from them selling out to the Gates foundation (mostly fucking over poor countries), to the opaque production difficulties and contract breaches, to these dangerous complications not being flagged during clinical trials."

19370,When the pharmacist gave me my shot she explained that they have a lot just sitting there because people Virginia deems eligible aren't interested or are cancelling appointments and that it's somehow illegal for them to publicly advertise they're willing to give it to anyone above 18 that wants it.
19371,I've got friends in their 20s wanting the vaccine but Virginia hasn't opened it up to them yet.
19372,"Yup I take it back, should be “when every adult has had the opportunity to easily get the vaccine if they want it”

Which considering how many people already have immunity from infection, will likely coincide with herd immunity"

19389,Why are they asking that now?
19390,The population boom was not overnight.
19391,"They knew the numbers they are dealing with, they knew there production capacity, they knew the virus is not going anywhere."
19392,"Which is incredible considering we once had the toughest restrictions in the country for many, many months (no indoor dining, etc) and now we're paying for it."
19393,&gt;Er ... that doesn't give it ownership of what it blocks ...

19395,"but the chance of accidentally killing an older family member when you're young and maybe asymptomatic is a lot more than 1 in 40000... some people can't distance from parents and old family that they live togetehr or have to assist, and its scary to go out there at work and run errands with the tiny chance of bringing the bug home with you everytime, while you wait for your shot in line"

Put yourself in the shoes of someone from the developing world 10 years from now about how there were different vaccines for rich countries and poor countries because of a side effect that most in the developing world have extreme difficulty in treating 

You may then have westerners continuing to say “they should be grateful” stirring resentment

The only possible moral solutions here are:

1."
19474,Identify at-risk groups for adenovirus-vector vaccines and be certain they’re given alternative vaccines while not barring it to most people.
19475,"(Do *not* say “at this age group, the risk of COVID outweighs the risk of side effects."
19476,"That is still an argument for giving them other vaccines so if that’s the case, give them the other vaccines.)"
19477,"This may require a ramp-up of mRNA vaccine tech and bringing freezers to the developing world and not using infrastructure as an excuse
2."
19478,Stopping use of adenovirus vector vaccines altogether *including* their export.
19479,This would also necessarily require developing the medical infrastructure of the developing world by making freezers and mRNA vaccines part of the deal
19480,What you’re not considering is that very shortly many people are going to declare the pandemic being over and everyone will resume normal activities.
19481,At that point we don’t know how the infection rate will be for the unvaccinated.
19482,Maybe everyone who is unvaccinated will eventually get it.
19483,In that case your odds of blood clots are much better with the vaccine.

Edit to add the big takeaway: “What we end up with is that the risk of dying from COVID-19 is anywhere from 36 to 78,571 times HIGHER than the risk of dying from a J&amp;J vaccine-related blood clot.”"

19505,"That said, the basic conclusion that Covid is much more likely in general to cause CVT than any vaccine seems perfectly correct."

19513,You’re correct.

19515,Some clinician probably said something to someone in the media about the birth control pill also causing clots at a “similar” incidence rate without clarifying the nature of the clots.
19516,And then someone else probably jumped to “it’s interacting”.
19517,The fact that more women than men were have had this reaction also probably plays into it.

19557,Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) if you have any questions or concerns.
19558,*
19559,Okay so then why are you dismissing Pfizer’s studies that say they aren’t seeing this happen?
19560,You are making my point.
19561,I assume Pfizer has the data and will release it.
19562,Both are not peer reviewed.
19563,"The best so far, that we can tell."
19564,I’m still waiting until they say “oh you need 2 shots every 6 months” and then people start having strange side effects when their bodies begin recognizing the nanolipid encapsulation as a threat.
19565,It happened in 2016 and they stopped all research.
19566,Then suddenly it emerges as a miracle.
19567,I’ll take my chances with the adenovirus vaccine
19568,"Here is the problem, the US has given 6 million JJ vaccines in the 2 months since approval and already detected 6 cases."
19569,"Pfizer and Moderna have been approved for four months and administered 185 million of these shots, including 123 million first doses."
19570,"If they had similar rates of clotting, it seems highly unlikely none of the roughly 180 people who would get it have been identified yet."
19571,"Yeah no arguments from me there, as long as they can handle it."
19572,Will be interesting to see how cases develop.
19573,In the past it has seemed every time an outbreak has loomed the case numbers just drop again.
19574,"But this time with them breaching 1,000 and rising I wonder what will happen."
19575,Testing is of course a big question but I haven't spent much time looking at their data.
19576,I know in the past a lot of the testing was very targeted.
19577,[deleted]
19578,"You're thinking of Nick Cordero, RIP."
19579,I feel so bad for his wife.
19580,Intensive care units were massively expanded but personal to staff them doesnt fall from the sky.
19581,Tbf the problem was never really infrastructure like in other countries but rather medical staff and that’s kinda hard to increase in just a year.
19582,"Yes, they could would have motives, but dismissing academic study because a company disagrees doesn't make sense."
19583,"They should just do more studies, probably some 100% independent ones."
19584,There are no cars that can go 90.
19585,There are exactly zero business that can operate at 100% capacity and maintain social distancing.
19586,Zero.
19587,"In your analogy, cars can only go 40."
19588,"Not.just my car, EVERY car."
19589,They are NOT two different restrictions.
19590,It does not jist impact the other.
19591,It makes the other IMPOSSIBLE.
19592,"Social distancing makes 100% capacity impossible, therefore its the social distancing that doesn't allow the 100% capacity."
19593,"There is no 100% capacity restriction lifted, they just used a different restriction to make 100% capacity impossible."
19594,So the restriction is still there.
19595,"Well I know lots of people are worried about the, you know?"
19596,Lmao
19597,You say that but if you get sick without insurance here you are financially ruined.
19598,"I haven't done the math on this, but the number for critical incidents (not only death) for AZ were one in 40.000 from Danish health authorities."
19599,Covid related deaths in dk is as you say 1-2 daily at the moment.
19600,"The officials call this under control, they are better capable than me to determine what 'under control'  means in this scenario, so I'll take their word for it."
19601,"But this is not a case of fear from vaccine issue, this is the health officials saying that currently it is not needed."
19602,"Fair enough you don't read Danish, but they also say it is not necessary a permanent no."
19603,"That said, today we seem to be considering giving it to poor nations in Africa, in which case it would be a permanent no for Danish use."
19604,"Personally I don't care which vaccine I'm given, but I can understand why people being injured by a vaccine they didn't really need would feel differently, which I think is also why we are saying no."
19605,Edit: typo
19606,I’m saying it will economically affect concert and club venues because I am far from the only person who would be really turned off by a mask mandate in either of those two settings
19607,It's not a choice I'm Denmark they have stopped using it altogether.
19608,Not a choice in Sweden either if yoy are under 65
19609,"And to my understanding, the vaccine has a fairly zero instance of respiratory failure."
19610,"People are inherently selfish, there is nothing despicable as take your health seriously."
19611,"Your assumption is wrong, I am brazilian, Brazil is one of the worst places for covid right now."
19612,We need vaccines here but I would never tell someone to ignore their fears and concerns because the UK wants to use their own vaccines that shows several issues and disregard other’s desire to have proper information about what they will take.
19613,"The UK has other options, they decided to use this one, they can chance and wait, a lot of the world is waiting, according to you, people who have an reaction can just get screwed because it is helping the rest of the country get protected."
19614,I am sorry but nor me nor many wants to be a causality of Government disregard of safety in order to speed up economy.
19615,"There are ways to prevent covid without the vaccine, and there is many others vaccines, if you want to take it, do it."
19616,But belittling someone who wants more information before they make a decision that may affect their death is just as despicable for me.
19617,"I think pulling J&amp;J off the market has opened a lot of people's eyes that our leaders aren't exactly weighing the various risks/benefits regarding COVID, but rather weighing it based on something else entirely."
19618,It can be anywhere between 3 and 8 weeks after your first shot
19619,[removed]
19620,Another comment said it is mandatory where they are.
19621,"As for the PTO I agree you shouldn't use PTO if you get sick, but that wasn't the complaint."
19622,"You don't understand, they give us a PTO bank B we can't even use and for the few thinks we can they use Bank A first."
19623,"Since I'm a guy and in good health, I've never used if because I won't be getting pregnant or have major surgeries."
19624,I hve 300+ hours I can eve use.
19625,"When I quit I got even get paid my Bank B, but I do get my Bank A."
19626,We all call it the fake Bank.
19627,It is used so the hospital can say they give us x amount of PTO a pay period even though half of it goes into Bank B that most staff will never use.
19628,More of a venting rant.
19629,Speaking of; anyone else getting light headed after like 10 minutes of cardio now?
19630,After getting the shot that is

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically."
19633,Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) if you have any questions or concerns.
19634,*
19635,I agree with mass vaccination sites.
19636,"They’re clean, efficient, and you’ll be in and out of there in 20 minutes."
19637,I still don't want a brain clot whatever it's caused by or the odds.
19638,I am getting my second moderna shot tomorrow.
19639,45% of republicans don't intend on getting vaccinated.
19640,That problem's a bit more concerning.
19641,Oh boy I cannot wait
19642,I’m shocked that Oxford would make this statement about Pfizer and Moderna.
19643,It works both ways.
19644,We need independent analysis.
19645,They both have too much skin in the game.
19646,Is there a difference in the antibodies from getting covid vs the vaccine.
19647,I've seen some reports saying covid antibodies last around 90 days but other reports saying the Pfizer vaccine is effective at least up to 6 months
19648,I still don't understand how people don't get that preventative measures don't mean you're 100% never going to catch the virus.
19649,Unless you live in a bubble and never leave your home you will always be at some risk of catching it.
19650,"If kids were an endpoint for the virus I would be with you, but it’s not."
19651,Kids get sick and pass it to their parents or grandparents or other caregivers.
19652,They might pass it to another kid who is immunocompromised.
19653,So I’m really not worried about my kids getting seriously ill or dying from Covid.
19654,I do worry my kid could be the vector to make someone seriously ill or kill others.
19655,"I believe we have a responsibility to look out for each other, so that’s something that factors into my decisions about all this."
19656,"I was charged $250 for a covid test I was ensured was free, despite going in skeptical and asking numerous times “are you sure this is free with my provider”?, and despite thinking I was clear with the CARES act."
19657,"Nope, my provider told me later it was out of network, and that the place I got it is charging for “administrative fees”."
19658,$250.
19659,People are reasonably skeptical to get any healthcare here.
19660,"This isn’t the first time I’ve been told I’m getting a “free” service, and then the middlemen find some sort of loophole to put the individual on the hook."
19661,"I honestly am scared I’ll be charged $1000s of dollars for my covid shots, even though my insurance has told me that I won’t have anything to worry about there."
19662,"I don’t have much of any trust that hospitals or my insurance are thinking of my best interest, they just see me as $$$."
19663,"No, the primary mode of transmission and infection is via droplets."
19664,"They also only used 480,000 people in their study of the mRNA vaccine."
19665,Why?
19666,There has been so many more doses of the mRNA vaccines administered.
19667,Yet they seem to use a much bigger number of people for the AZ ratio.
19668,[removed]
19669,More like 15 minutes.
19670,There are exceptions obviously that having a mask helps with.
19671,Namely like if someone spits on you via talking or purposefully or coughing or sneezing.
19672,It’s all about risk management.
19673,The likelihood while outside standing minding your own business is low.
19674,[removed]
19675,I just truly don't get it.
19676,It's a mild inconvenience.
19677,That's it.
19678,Why do people just adamantly refuse to be mildly inconvenienced for any reason?
19679,It makes no sense whatsoever.
19680,"I assumed surfaces was any physical surface, including a human body."
19681,But the definition of fomite shows that my assumption was false.
19682,So that means the primary mode of transmission is physical human to human contact?
19683,The clots caused by az are different in nature to those caused by the birth control pill.
19684,That possible interaction link has been ruled out.
19685,The link was made probably due to some confusion about the reporting: the incidence rate was apparently “similar”.
19686,If there's an air current that means it's well ventilated and the virus will dissipate in the air.
19687,This is why outdoor transmission is so rare.
19688,"Yeah, I'll still wear one in stores and other public indoor places for two reasons: 1.)"
19689,People don't know I'm vaccinated and I don't want to make them uncomfortable; 2.)
19690,"there's still a small chance that I can catch a mild version and pass it on to someone else who isn't vaccinated, which I certainly wouldn't want to do."
19691,I was wearing the mask before it was mandated and I got used to it pretty quickly.
19692,"Honestly, I may continue to wear it on public transportation and flights even after this is done."
19693,Not having caught a cold in over a year has been nice.
19694,[removed]
19695,"Ho ho, calm down."
19696,"There's been a lot of issues with vaccine deliveries (and even rollouts in some countries), but you don't have to compare us to the US."
19697,Your comment almost read like a eulogy.
19698,Unless that doctor worked in a hospital it’s unlikely he was fully vaccinated that early.
19699,"Omg, finally, someone said it."
19700,I've been absolutely livid at this repeated argument.
19701,It's completely flawed.
19702,The risk of getting a blood clot via vaccination is only IF you get vaccinated.
19703,"And like you said, more likely to develop blood clots from COVID but only IF you contract it."
19704,lol yeah.
19705,"That, pure silence or my personal favorite is when someone asks if I hear that sound which inevitably leads to me explaining no and why not and being told I should see a doctor about that..."
19706,"Looks like 20k-40k by may, and then millions in the following months for Israel/NZ."
19707,"For US, they just got approved for clinical trials so much longer I would think, but doesn’t say"
19708,Because in December the older people were dying fast enough to free up beds but the current wave has younger patients and they don't die as often but instead stay longer.
19709,"Here's a video from the Dekan of the Universitätsklinik Leipzig: https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1382404570844921858/pu/vid/1280x720/icT84wBqTu-PxDj7.mp4?tag=12

And he's saying *""Die 2."

19713,We don't have that currently.

19715,In Maryland that IS the law for hospital services.
19716,"You can actually get an estimate beforehand - it can't be exact because there's no way to know exactly what they are going to find, how much recovery you'll need, etc - but you can [get estimates online."

19719,"Physician fees aren't included, so for an elective you'd still have to get that estimate, it's not perfect, but better than other states."
19720,"A real commentary on American healthcare that this IS better, but still.)"
19721,Pretty much all of them.
19722,"Cold, flu, COVID."
19723,"I contracted COVID around the holidays, and it caused a condition called labyrinthitis which caused me to experience an extreme case of vertigo that led to the loss of hearing out of my left ear."
19724,"Labyrinthitis is caused by a viral infection inflicting severe inflammation on the auditory nerves and labyrinth membrane in the inner ear, which can cause permanent hearing loss/damage/tinnitus."

**ABSTRACT:** **Although the risk of venous thromboembolism is increased among oral contraceptive users** compared with nonusers who are not pregnant and not taking hormones,"
19733,"I mean looking at the chart, it still looks like it's better for anyone with medium or high exposure levels, if they can't get an alternate vaccine in a few months."
19734,"Yeah I agree that that is the right conclusion, I just wanted to correct the claim I previously made that there was 0 evidence of it."
19735,"same, can someone explain."
19736,Will only change when their bottom line becomes affected.
19737,Right now Starbucks and DD both require masks nationwide.
19738,"If DD dropped the mask mandate, Starbucks would follow suit if it affected their bottom line due to more people going to DD for this."
19739,Right now my entire extended family except one of my sisters has been vaccinated with at least one shot.
19740,She’s still undecided but is super aggressive about masking and distancing at the few family gatherings we’ve had.
19741,"I told her point blank yesterday that once we were all fully vaccinated, don’t expect us to be wearing masks at family gatherings."
19742,"Aspirin won’t reduce your risk for these vaccine-related clots, and may actually make your situation worse."
19743,"&gt;Hunt cautioned against taking aspirin, stressing it is thought the clotting problems are down to an immune response."
19744,"&gt;
&gt;“So taking aspirin is not going to be helpful."
19745,"Taking an anticoagulant probably isn’t going to be helpful, especially if you are going to get a low platelet count, it will increase your risk of bleeding,” she said."
19746,"“And we know if you take aspirin and you don’t need to take aspirin the benefits aren’t very good and there is a risk that you can bleed spontaneously.”

19747,I’ve seen multiple doctors say the same thing.)
19748,Do you seriously still think the Governments are taking the most scientifically sound response after the past year and a half of governments taking the worst possible course of action at almost every point?
19749,How sad.
19750,"If it lasts a year or two, would that make a difference?"
19751,Think of their suffering.
19752,Would you take their suffering upon yourself?
19753,Have some compassion for those that are ill.
19754,"I don't have clear which one is best, but I think in the worst there is one ahead by merit..."
19755,There's a big difference between now and 2 months from now.
19756,"In many urban areas the vaccine isn't even available to the general public yet, and if it is it only recently became available."
19757,If nothing else that situation will be a lot different in 2 months.
19758,bravo
19759,"The Office of National Statistics investigates this - see https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/coronaviruscovid19infectionsurveyantibodydatafortheuk/14april2021 

The answer is estimated at c. 55%, but that was based on data two weeks ago (it takes time to do statistics), so probably around 2/3 right now which is approaching herd immunity levels."
19760,"Wow, that was sooo sarcastic."
19761,[removed]
19762,I think this is a ridiculous take.
19763,"Exactly its 6 out of 7 million people, thats pretty fucking low risk I dont see the issue"
19764,Does this mean that the different vaccines produce slightly different proteins so we end up with slightly different antibodies?
19765,"Or is it a case of identical proteins but the different methods of generating them means a stronger, more targeted, or greater amount of antibodies?"
19766,"Probably a higher chance of getting into a car crash on the way to the vaccination centre, and with the car crash you're not able to seek medical attention prior to the symptoms of the car crash reaching a critical point and getting treated.,"
19767,"And in 5 years the original virus is burned out with a million and a half Americans dead, and some as yet to exist variant is working its way around killing off the 3-5 million Americans weakened by long covid plus another 2 million otherwise healthy Americans."
19768,The cost of waiting 5 years was unacceptable.
19769,"These people won't get that because ""ever heard of an immune system?"

19772,"Your risk math is really bad here, 1 in 8 is wholly uninvolved."
19773,It's *WAYYYYYYYYYYY* less likely than that to either catch COVID or develop a brain clot from the AZ vaccine.
19774,"It's a good thing for your point, you're way more right than you're giving yourself credit."
19775,"That said, it's not up to the CDC/FDA to do life math for people."
19776,"It's their job to make the public aware of the risk, and AZ/J&amp;J aren't being paused because they're ""too risky"" they're being paused because we don't know what the risk is."
19777,"SO FAR the only data we have shows it's a very low risk, but that may not be all the data available."

19780,"&gt;  
&gt;https://www.cato.org/commentary/what-war-drugs-can-teach-us-about-fighting-covid-19

Yep."
19781,And it's worth noting that this shit isn't going to disappear.
19782,I haven't heard anyone say that they think COVID cases will go to zero - everyone thinks the virus will become endemic - many think we will have resurgences in 6-12 months as the virus mutates and that we will need annual boosters to the vaccine.
19783,"And even if we assume that we can get COVID to zero, that doesn't mean masks are useless."
19784,10-60K Americans die per year of the flu alone in an average year (it's basically 0 this year) - a lot of those deaths could be prevented if we all wore masks forever.
19785,"Uk has never paused az, just acknowledged the potential issue and then advised a different vaccine be used for under 30s on a balance of risk basis."
19786,"We don't seem to have much of a drop in the perception of safety even though you might expect one, so pausing likely has had a more negative impact than simply a warning would have"
19787,So what.
19788,They are significantly more important and there are less of them.
19789,"This would be a point worth discussing if the risk of blood clots from the vaccine were 1 in 1000, or even 1 in 10,000, but by the time you're up to 1 in 1,000,000 it's really just fearmongering."
19790,With those odds you could get the vaccine every single day for the rest of your life and still only have a ~1% chance of getting a blood clot.
19791,Every time you climb in a car you're accepting a higher risk than that.
19792,Not to talk about the possible delay if you get an allergic reaction or worse.
19793,"""I just got the vaccine"" ""which one"" ""don't know""..."
19794,Absolutely unacceptable to not get informed of what goes into your body.
19795,No choice of shot?
19796,Fine.
19797,Not informed consent?!!
19798,!
19799,Fuck the CDC.

19802,How convenient?

19804,what if you are in a country with no covid or almost no covid?
19805,why should those people take even those small risks?
19806,World leaders are probably at significantly lower risk than grocery store workers.
19807,Pardon?
19808,Does anyone know how long they are estimating for the approval?

19810,"We’re going to have to reverse polarity and then synchronize the beta waves while still maintaining epsilon barrier integrity, captain."
19811,It’s never been done before!
19812,People watch their parents die of cancers and then continue to eat and smoke themselves to death immediately after.
19813,It's the way people are.
19814,&gt; Why cant people understand that there is a subset of people at significantly higher risk?
19815,Because most of the discourse surrounding this is people *outside of that subset* saying that they aren't going to use the vaccine.
19816,"If you explain yourself literally no one is going to continue shaming you, who should be shamed are the people that think that the west should effectively pawn off the vaccines they deem dangerous on the third world while hoarding even more of the vaccines they deem safe."
19817,"This is a global effort and the First World deciding to say ""fuck everyone else I'm going to demand more Pfizer vaccines"" means less of those vaccines for everyone else."
19818,"For argument's sake, nobody has suffered from long term effects for longer than 18 months."
19819,I would not stress it.
19820,"Allergies are not a concern, and while there is a chance you got covid and your allergies masked it, that is pretty unlikely."
19821,If you get non-allergy symptoms then you should hold off.
19822,Yes.
19823,Joking aside only some evangelicals are doing this.
19824,A lot of others are eagerly getting vaccinated for a return to traditional services.
19825,"The pastor cited in this article needs to stay in his own lane, because his ignorance is astounding and he's not loving his neighbor as himself by discouraging high risk congregants from getting vaccinated."
19826,They need to take this video and just put it on repeat down there.
19827,"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-io8Ufsq67A

And I’m totally serious."
19828,Know your audience.
19829,Show them this video and ask them to do it.
19830,The article mentions mention that they have gotten more black communities on board with public outreach and I see no reason we can’t do the same with the rural white ones.
19831,I bet the endorsement of Trump would persuade a lot of minds in those communities.
19832,lol its over.
19833,Even if blood clots aren't an issue the anti-vaxx crowd has got their win.
19834,"You can try giving ""facts"" or ""debate"" them but that shit wont matter."
19835,Even before the blood clots a solid 20% to 30% werent going to get the vaccine now its way higher.
19836,"That’s not quite right, yes you are most likely to get in an accident 10 miles from your house and yes that’s because thats where you do most of your driving, but that doesn’t warp driving risk per mile."
19837,Risk per mile doesn’t account for nor care about where the miles are driven (outside of being in one state or one country)
19838,It's impossible to keep your kid away from the flu if they are in school.
19839,You never even thought about your kid dying from the flu before all of this did you?
19840,Or scarring people off to avoid this and future vaccines all together.
19841,The public needs to trust the vaccines are safe or people won’t take the chance.
19842,Have they PROVEN that the other vaccines don't turn you into a unicorn?
19843,Answer that question and then you can answer the question you asked (hint: the information is available to you).
19844,Well the blood clots could be related to the fact they already have COVID before they were vaccinated.
19845,Which means the vaccination is not the cause of the blood clots in some or all of the cases.

19898,Depends on how many variants come about
19899,You know that the AZ vaccine is being sold at cost (as mandated by Oxford) and the contracts already mandate that they will pay for all doses if the governments back out right?
19900,Why on Earth would Astrozeneca be paying off journalists to continue not even making a profit when the result of the countries backing out means they get to retool all of the factories that were built as part of the contracts to production lines that actually make them a profit.
19901,"This is absolute madness, there is an infintessimally tiny risk attached to a vaccine that will make Astrozeneca no further profit, you should be quite frankly ashamed of yourself for peddling this kind of conspiracy theory and then having the gall to use the fact that you are a science teacher to back up your point."

19907,I was on a local subreddit last night reading people's comments about how they're vaccinated and are now going from 2 masks to 1 mask.
19908,THAT'S FUCKING CRAZY.
19909,And it was one comment after another saying the same thing.

19913,They also don’t wear masks when training.
19914,Your cases are exactly the same as these 6 in 6 million.
19915,Of course.
19916,Thank you for the reasonable response.
19917,There are some pretty bad anti vaccine arguments going around and people are looking for ways to support their position.
19918,This is just conspiracy theorizing.
19919,Multiple independent public health institutions around the world have come to the same conclusion- that the vaccine is safer than natural covid infection among all people over 30.
19920,AZ isn’t in charge of public health institutions’ policy decisions and vaccine rollout plans.
19921,These institutions are gathering their own independent statistics on vaccinated people through various reporting systems and doing their own risk assessments.
19922,"Of course AZ has an incentive to make the vaccine seem safe, but they don’t have some stranglehold on public policy across dozens of countries around the world, and there is zero evidence that they have downplayed the risk of their vaccine."
19923,"The phase III trials were done in conjunction with independent public health institutions, so it’s extremely unlikely that AZ would be able to falsify data without the FDA/CDC knowing."
19924,"The risk of this complication is also on the order of 1/100,000-1/1,000,000 and the phase III trial had less than 40k participants so it’s unlikely an effect this rare would show up in their trials, but event reporting after millions of doses would pick it up."
19925,Just because AZ didn’t report this side effect doesn’t mean they’re maliciously downplaying risks for profit.
19926,It’s rare enough that they couldn’t have statistically detected it at all.
19927,"Public health institutions around the world have gathered the data, assessed the risk, and suspended its use in vulnerable age groups out of caution."
19928,This is the system working exactly as it should.
19929,"A monetary conflict of interest isn’t evidence of conspiracy, and absent some real evidence that AZ has been dishonest, sowing doubt in this way only contributes to vaccine hesitancy and fuels anti-vaccine sentiment."
19930,"exactly, it's not the perfect time to drop masks, but I don't trust pritzker to drop it  at the actual correct time."

19951,Dont stop and eventually it leaks that you know and people really start to not trust the vaccines.
19952,Stop and people dont trust it but at least you can explain the situation less damage control.
19953,The main reason for the pause is to take a step back and see if they can find a correlation between patients and also get updated information out to healthcare providers on what to look out for and how to treat the blood clots.

19978,Better just get some audio recorded of that heater now to play at home.
19979,Yeah I think the CDC has to start talking about a normal life if you are vaccinated.
19980,That having the vaccine allows you to live a normal life.

19982,"But isn’t the blood clots 1/100,000 or something like that?"
19983,The vaccines are not 100% effective and that has never been the message.

19985,About 77MM people in the US have been fully vaccinated.
19986,"5,800 people is just 0.0075% of that number."
19987,"Per the article:

&gt; Breakthrough cases are expected."
19988,"The vaccines are not 100% effective in preventing infections and as 10s of millions of people are vaccinated, more and more such cases will be reported."
19989,"&gt;I do feel like if you want to get more of us vaccinated though, you have to change the massaging, just saying the vaccine prevents death isn't going to work for that much longer as the most at risk are vaccinated, you have to offer a return to normal life as being linked with getting vaccinated, ie; no masks after a certain percentage, no restrictions for businesses, no online schooling, etc."
19990,"[Or how about we go with the historically tried and true approach of launching vaccine raids in the middle of the night to get the holdouts](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/how-new-york-separated-immigrant-families-smallpox-outbreak-1901-180971211/)

&gt;Late on a Friday night in February 1901, when the residents of an Italian neighborhood in New York City’s East Harlem were home and sleeping, a battalion of more than 200 men—police officers and doctors—quietly occupied the roofs, backyards and front doors of every building for blocks."

19993,Could it be that this would be just to fine tune it with variants and that after the 3rd we might have a bit longer breathing room?
19994,I mean the degradation news from the last week or two made me think we were headed down a 2-5 year path for boosters.
19995,Yeah COVID will most likely just be another flu that we have to get a shot every year for it.

19998,"Tbh, I got my vaccine and was never asked for my ID or anything - this was thru walmart."
19999,Pretty sure they can just use a friend or family’s address to get their vaccines lol.
20000,Basically it's probably going to be because of people who are older whose immunity erodes three times as fast as people who are younger with this.
20001,In six months they were starting to see for most people that immunity was good but for people over the age of 60 with comorbidities there was a fairly large degree of waning I think about 5/6 or something like that if I recall correctly but it's been awhile since I've seen the data.
20002,In the long run this will likely be something that little kids are given the vaccine and senior citizens are given the vaccine and relatively few others end up with it.

20013,Either way it’s a no win situation where public trust is concerned.
20014,I've been proactive this whole time about stopping the spread but I've never felt the need to mask up outside unless I was going into a situation where I would be shoulder to shoulder with people for extended periods of time.

20101,"I figured if I don’t feel as bad as I fear I will, I’ll have a nice day on the couch binge watching my shows."
20102,"Especially since as my family is getting vaccinated and my state has lifted restrictions (not all of them, but venues can have more capacity and such), my calendar is starting to pick back up."
20103,I don’t take that many lazy days from work.
20104,Their deaths per day rolling average has gone from under 100 to approaching 1000 over the last few weeks so it’s definitely deadly enough to still cause a lot of problems.
20105,"Accidents happen guys, its all part of the testing."
20106,We should all still want it.
20107,LO LO LO LO LO LOL
20108,My wife had no fever-like symptoms but her arm was itchy and there was a bump where she got her shot.
20109,I checked up on her everyday till it was gone.
20110,She’s feeling fine.
20111,Her two weeks are up.
20112,"Hopefully, I will love to go to a theme park in the summer without wearing the thing."
20113,The virus will likely become endemic and will mutate.
20114,Especially with so many people being hesitant about getting the vaccine.
20115,Plus the countries who can't afford to vaccinate their populations right away.
20116,It's likely those of us who do vaccinate will need boosters for years to come as variants emerge in those groups.
20117,That's why it's so important for everyone to get vaccinated and quickly.
20118,"If people choose not to vaccinate in this country, new variants will emerge as the virus percolates."
20119,That's also why it's so important to help other countries get vaccinated.
20120,Oh just saw that.
20121,I'm so flustered with this shit that's happening that I just jumped and ranted out.
20122,I'm far more concerned with lingering health issues.
20123,"My neighbor got it in December (he's up there, around 70) and he's still on oxygen."
20124,He would get the flu just about every year and handled it just fine.
20125,"This thing is fucking gnarly and terrible, and is being severely underplayed of it's impact because it's all about whether you die, or you don't."
20126,"In reality, there are fates worse than death, like having permanent lung scarring or organ damage."
20127,"And this is not just relegated to the elderly; there's millions of people who's lives are permanently altered from this disease, from all across the age spectrum."
20128,"There are some states here with an outdoor mask mandate, but almost no one follows them and very, very few police officers are willing to enforce it."
20129,"Have you checked your county's health department website for other appointment slots, or perhaps a pharmacy in your area?"
20130,That's a good point too that I didn't even think about!
20131,"I was skeptical of the article in the first place, without that vital information, we really can't take this info at face value."
20132,"Even after setting up those sites, the UK still got the majority of it's doses from imports from the EU and India."
20133,Best level-headed response.
20134,Thank you.
20135,In the land of the close talkers?
20136,!
20137,"I mean, while numbers are still low it's still enough to scare people."
20138,But that's just because we're still pretty early in overall vaccination rollout.
20139,While cases are popping up their rate relative to unvaccinated individuals proves the vaccine's efficacy as clear as day.
20140,As we approach herd immunity this red flagging will certainly end as people come to better understand the nature of vaccines.
20141,We haven't experienced a situation quite like this in a century.
20142,"But even so, there are literally people who say ""don't get the vaccine, it makes you 8 times more likely to get the south african variant"" because they clearly have never read scientific studies in their entire lives."
20143,It's infuriating.
20144,"No sources in English yet, the decision has just been announced and all major Israeli news agencies are reporting it."
20145,"Google translate:

&gt;Health Minister Yuli (Yoel) Edelstein this evening (Thursday) instructed the director of his office, Prof. Hezi Levy, to sign an order that will allow the removal of masks in the open, starting this coming Sunday, April 18."
20146,The directive came after receiving the position of the professionals in the ministry according to which in view of the low morbidity there is no longer a need for masks in open space.
20147,"It should be emphasized: in a closed area, the obligation to wear a mask will still apply."
20148,"As stated, the directive will take effect starting this coming Sunday, 18.4.21."
20149,"&gt;  
&gt;Health Minister Edelstein: ""The masks are intended to protect us from the corona virus."
20150,"After the professionals came to the conclusion that this was no longer needed in the open, I decided to allow the masks to be removed according to their recommendation."
20151,"""For you, the citizens of Israel."
20152,I still ask you to be equipped with a mask for the purpose of entering closed buildings.
20153,"Together we will keep the morbidity low."""
20154,That's exactly how it works in my state.
20155,I know.
20156,I'm trying to say that selfish people refusing to get the vaccine potentially screw over the small percentage of people who can't get it.
20157,"Their actions affect others, and other people will also have to live with the actions of these selfish people."
20158,[removed]
20159,8 times isn't enough for me.
20160,Should be much higher tbh
20161,"Israel, a country with 9,000,000 people, has a seven day average of seven daily deaths."
20162,Cases have plummeted.
20163,Both metrics are continuing this trend.
20164,The vaccines work.
20165,"I do think the United States will be in this position within a month, proportionally speaking that would be between two and three hundred deaths a day in the United States."
20166,Right now it's 764.
20167,I think we're very close to the effective social end to the pandemic.
20168,[deleted]
20169,I’m not aware of penicillin allergies being lethal like a blood clot is.
20170,"I get you must have stock in J&amp;J or something, But if better alternatives exist (they do), why would we keep using it?"
20171,Not everyone has access and transportation to the alternatives had ride and transportation serup for j&amp;j tomorrow.
20172,Now if i get covid who's fault is that?
20173,I have no transportation.
20174,38 life long smoker.
20175,Former opiate addict taking mu opiate to stave off cravings 10 years now.
20176,No transportation.
20177,No job laid off for over a year.
20178,Need appointment close by so i can find a ride.
20179,CDC is on a PR bullshit campaign.
20180,I know the risks and the benefits out wiegh them by 6.799.994 million
20181,Illinois case rise is slowing down with no material change to mobility.
20182,Feels like green shoots.
20183,You do realize that covid can cause blood clots?
20184,At a much higher rate?
20185,The science was always clear that masks would offer some protection against a respiratory virus.
20186,But they lied anyways.
20187,[deleted]
20188,Congrats on making that last statement.
20189,"i'm more than double your age so out of curiosity, how many of your hs peers are planning to get the shot?"
20190,Less than half?
20191,I know with the HPV vaccine only something like 25% of teens take it.
20192,"Unfortunately, other people have to live with that choice too."
20193,That’s not how it works.
20194,I got my vaccine without providing any of that.
20195,Just my name and phone number.
20196,[removed]
20197,"trumpet players, which also try to prevent you from wearing earplugs."
20198,"/s 

but yeah, like the other post said inner ear damage or deafness can cause tinnitus."
20199,"it is a pretty common problem and one that can't actually be cured, though not all tinnitus is debilitating or even really a problem."
20200,if tinnitus gets loud enough to start interfering with your sleep it can become a pretty serious issue.
20201,"Well, that isn't a choice, then."
20202,"But there's nothing here to even kind of imply that the vaccine had a role to play in the death, she doesn't even know if her doctor was vaccinated."
20203,"It sounds like what the previous poster is describing, completely baseless assumption hopping to get to a conclusion that most likely validates some deeper fear she holds."
20204,"I mean there were lots of cases early in the pandemic last year, like the Valencia / Atalanta Champions League game which was one of the main causes behind the serious COVID outbreak in Bergamo (one of the hardest hit cities in Italy)."
20205,"Later on the manager of Atalanta said he decided to coach the game rather than going to a hospital, despite having COVID symptoms, because he was scared of the number of COVID patients that were already at Bergamo hospital (he later tested positive for COVID)."
20206,On Valencia's side they said over a third of the team's coaching staff + players also tested positive.
20207,"As for more recently, there have been some pretty big outbreaks that caused matches to get postponed in the EPL (the league I follow, I'm sure others as well) - for example Newcastle reportedly had 19 positive cases in a week during December, which forced them to postpone at least one match (and IIRC one of their best players, Allan Saint-Maximin, struggled with after symptoms for weeks)."
20208,Man City had some players out on both the men's and women's teams and also had to postpone a match.
20209,"And if you expand to other sports - I follow figure skating where a lot of the top contenders (particularly in women's figure skating) are from Russia, and there have been a lot of cases in the Russian figure skating community in particular, including a skater named Alena Kostornaia, who was the reigning European Champion (which considering Russia's dominance means she is automatically one of the favorites to win Worlds / Olympics) - she was out for many weeks with a serious case of COVID, and ran out of time to get back into competitive shape to qualify for Worlds, despite being only 16 years old which doesn't put her in the risk group for COVID at all."
20210,"Luckily the winter olympics aren't until next year, but I would say this is an example that trying to hold the Olympics in the middle of a pandemic has a negative impact on the competitive integrity of the games as well, especially in sports like figure skating where a lot of top contenders might only have 1 shot in their entire career to qualify and compete."
20211,Unfortunately so do the people who want to get the vaccine but can't because of medical reasons.
20212,Fox gave Tucker Carlson their prime time space the other day to spread his theory that the vaccine does not actually work.
20213,Actually not necessarily.
20214,I believe they are testing several different boosters.
20215,"Original booster, one that targets the more problematic strain(s), and one that is a mix."
20216,I think they are going to have to know more about protection piercing events to know why and how they are happening.
20217,It's quite possible that simply elevating the levels of existing antibodies is sufficient.
20218,Even though some strains are a tougher fight.
20219,"TLDR is that we'll have to wait and see to solidify what boosters look like, when we need them, and why we need them (waning antibodies, protection piercing strains, etc.)"
20220,It is free in the sense that it will not cost individual people more money.
20221,"If I, along with 7 million, don’t decide to get vaccinated, no money will be saved."
20222,"My girlfriend and I got COVID at the same time (last November) and got the vaccine within a week of each other (me last week, her this week)."
20223,"I had slightly worse COVID symptoms than she did, but she's been absolutely bowled over by the vaccine side effects while I've only had a sore arm both times."
20224,"There’s also the math of knowing this risk exists, is it treatable?"
20225,"From my limited understanding, the clots are treatable but *not* with heparin, which is the go-to anticoagulant."
20226,"If the risk is understood and can be managed by saying “if you experience these symptoms within the next n-m days, go get checked for this.”

There are a lot of ways to mitigate risk, I think the pause is just to make sure the risk is clearly understood so those decisions can be made."
20227,Our politicians in Lithuania also waited for their turn by age (just some oldest parliamentarians and elderly former officials vaccinated) at the start.
20228,"However, when the drama with AZ vaccination suspension and continuation happened, the president and MPs all vaccinated with AZ to promote confidence."
20229,They added '/s' at the end which refers to being sarcastic.
20230,"Yes, not the best time to be sarcastic and joke about it."
20231,Neither has an outdoor mask mandate at the moment.
20232,Vaccines are working and Israel is ahead of the curve; but outdoor transmission was never the problem except in very crowded situations.
20233,there's no medical data for this kind of scenario.
20234,AZ and Pfizer use 2 different types of delivery mechanisms.
20235,"Immunologists don't know how they will interact, and whether they will counteract each other."
20236,"I've read incidental reports of patients who for one reason or another have missed their 2nd dose at the scheduled time, and doctors advising them to just hold on and take the SAME vaccine when possible, even if it's many weeks later."
20237,They don't recommend mixing and matching.
20238,"I wasn’t able to access the article, but did they establish causation of vaccine to clots?"
20239,"The headline makes it seem that both the vaccine and the virus can cause clots, but the virus is 8 times more likely to cause."
20240,"In the event that the vaccine DOES cause clots, do we know if any other vaccines show this behavior?"
20241,"If not, maybe let’s call those the better ones and shift supply to the better vaccines (assuming similar efficacy of preventing infection)."
20242,"I wouldn’t blame anyone for wanting to wait for the better vaccine, and staying cautious in their every day lives."
20243,"Your situation isn't typical, even in the US."
20244,Most people live in cities and suburbs where this isn't the case.
20245,"Israel in general has a higher population density than the US, and Jerusalem has a similar population density to San Francisco."
20246,"It happened briefly in FL but then they made a residency requirement and that has since stopped, but I can see that happening again in a couple of months."
20247,"Honestly, why not?"
20248,Come drop your money here and getchu a shot.
20249,[removed]
20250,[removed]
20251,Well this is still a horrible title.
20252,If only 1 in 10 people who got az would have gotten covid otherwise.
20253,Az would still cause more blood clots than covid would have.
20254,I mean 10000x more people would have been hospitalized for the 39 other things that covid causes.
20255,So the whole thing is besides the point hysteria.
20256,But that title itself is misleading.

20475,I just posed this in another thread about this news.
20476,Oral contraceptives kill and maim many thousands of woman every year and you rarely hear about it.
20477,It's true that implants are much safer (and more reliable) though like anything they have their own issues.
20478,So are you saying it’s Florida’s fault that Michigan is seeing a surge?
20479,LOL.
20480,Agree.
20481,They are counting the number of incidents of CVT from Covid and as a side effect of the vaccine and comparing.
20482,"Hardly difficult, especially if you have these things called computers."
20483,I could probably work it out myself on Excel if I had access to the data.
20484,"Most of the new discoveries you read about haven't been peer reviewed yet, but will be."
20485,"For example, have J&amp;J complications been proven and peer reviewed?"
20486,The US government can still make decisions based on data.
20487,"I can't believe people on this sub find it SO hard to believe Covid is more dangerous than the vaccine, when the virus has clearly killed millions of people?"
20488,Which is fine.
20489,The major issue I see is people who were already against vaccinations and any efforts to slow the spread of COVID are using this to justify not getting any vaccine at all.
20490,“See I told you vaccines are bad.
20491,Wait until they find the secret 5G chips in them next!”
20492,"If the german hypothesis is true, and it is an autoimmune reaction to the spike protein + platelet complex which causes cross-reaction autoantibodies that activate platelets gobally, you are right."
20493,"But they have already come with a guideline, both diagnostic wise and with regards to treatment that involves immonuglobulins to ""supress"" the autoantibodies effect."
20494,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33822348/
20495,Genuine question.
20496,"Does this create a situation where if you got Pfizer initially, you’d need to stay with Pfizer for your booster?"
20497,Or would it be okay to get the Moderna at that point?
20498,and for good reason
20499,r/covid19_support
20500,Yeah.
20501,"Agreed 100%

Consult for your own personal risk level."
20502,It's difficult to convince young people to get a vaccine that has any risk when the virus will likely have a zero effect on them.
20503,There is a very good case to be made for a certain subset of our population to get it based on their own personal risk.
20504,I support them for it.
20505,"I also cannot blame younger people to avoid this particular, very new, very political, vaccine."
20506,What do they need for the indoor one to go?
20507,Seriously what's left to wait for?
20508,"Right, the vaccines that people are getting for free, totally a scam."
20509,"Or it could mean they know theres way more than 6, but only 6 officially confirmed"

20511,I say no later than Memorial Day.
20512,I care about them.
20513,I think we should help.
20514,I don't think that my loved ones are worth less and so we should prioritize other people instead of them.
20515,And you haven't told me why my loved ones' lives are worth less to the point that they shouldn't get it when it's available and instead it should go to other people.

20853,thank you!
20854,So exciting to see 4% per week on the 0+ number.
20855,In 2 to 3 weeks we’ll be breaking 50% total population.
20856,That’s huge.
20857,What's the point of living if I have to wear a mask at the beach?
20858,Yes.
20859,It opened up on the 12 for everyone outside of downtown Chicago.
20860,If you live in downtown Chicago you can get an appointment outside of downtown right now if you want.
20861,Downtown Chicago opens up appointments to the general population on the 19th.
20862,You kidding?
20863,Worst part about the dog park is the people and them trying to talk to you.

20865,[deleted]
20866,"Think if we were smarter with the allocations a month ago, you'd see a higher percentage across the board."
20867,Several top states in usage were very supply strapped for 3-4 weeks and I think the frustration for making appointments for the tech-challenged didn't help.
20868,If it has been easier to make appointments you'd have a higher daily average too.
20869,Instead a lot of those vaccines went to states that were inefficient with their own distribution or states that had more supply than demand.

20871,Good.
20872,"You should do what you feel comfortable with, I don’t know why you’re being downvoted for possessing a pretty common opinion amongst vulnerable individuals."
20873,Until we are close to herd immunity there is going to be more risk then a lot of people feel comfortable with.
20874,Just wave a light over it.
20875,They'll be fine...
20876,This is the wrong approach.
20877,Imagine if we had reacted to vaccine skepticism in the black community with this “oh well let them suffer then” approach.
20878,We need to reach out to *all* communities and encourage and increase vaccine access.
20879,It benefits all of us in the long run.
20880,Wow.
20881,Hitting nearly 50 percent by April.
20882,"With how hard NYC was hit, it wouldn't surprise me if that would put then near heard immunity."

20884,Exactly.

20886,They are a large company with a the right plans in place.
20887,...... so just gonna social distance forever then?
20888,"She has a replacement, and the replacement has a replacement, too."
20889,Forgive me for my ignorance - this sort of thing isn't my strong point - but is the *current* infection rate the right stat to be looking at?
20890,Would your chances of catching covid *in the long run* not be different (potentially higher)?
20891,"I'll give you an honest answer to your question, because you are obviously some dipshit anti-vaccine asshole"
20892,It is a fact that everyone who receives the vaccine will die.
20893,"Of course, so will the unvaccinated."
20894,Im so sorry you went through that.
20895,In general risks amd associated risk groups really need to be made clear so everyone can make informed decisions.
20896,Keep in mind that among the 74 you probably have people who were infected slightly before they got the vaccine.
20897,And 74 deaths among 78 million fully vaccinated people is nothing.
20898,It's statistical noise.
20899,Staff shortage is a main issue in most countries now.
20900,You know what has a lower chance of giving you a blood clot?
20901,Using a different vaccine.
20902,These arguments are dumb.
20903,Currently half in my death bed due to the second shot.
20904,Not really but damn...never had every joint in my body ache at the same time before.
20905,Only thing worse than being exhausted is being in too much pain to sleep.
20906,Well so much for covid going away guess it will just always linger in large infection rates
20907,Also kids.
20908,And the more it spreads the greater the risk it mutates to a form that evades vaccines.

20910,The Kessler quote could be the headline if anything.

21014,"Cutting a customer's order by nearly 80% does get you bad PR, yes."
21015,Endemic?
21016,"I understand the concerns, but risk wise taking the vaccine versus risking covid is a no brainer."
21017,Is this a serious question?
21018,Do you ask what's even the point of changing the oil in your car because you're sick of doing it every few thousand miles?
21019,the amount of cases doesn't matter.
21020,the studies are designed to stop when they've tracked a certain number of cases for the control group.
21021,"So all higher or lower community infection rates do is change how long the trial takes to complete, but nothing else about it."
21022,"Now, J&amp;J dealt with more variants, so THAT might have had an effect."
21023,But that's a different thing.
21024,Why on earth do they still have an indoor mask mandate?
21025,I'm in Region Hannover.
21026,"I was going to gripe, but I have been pleasantly surprised:   
   
I just this afternoon snagged an appointment at my doctor's for next week."
21027,"It was to have been for my wife, but she'll be in hospital on their vax-day, so they gave it to me instead."
21028,"I calculated both her and my probabilities of serious illness, we're about even."
21029,Perhaps hospitals will also offer shots?
21030,"There is no alternative science, but just idiocy... And they say that North Korea is bad.."
21031,"I suppose I meant, “in the context of other risks we already endure on a daily basis”; things we naturally allow/ignore because their rate of occurrence falls so low that it’s almost equally likely to happen by chance as by negligence."
21032,"That being, we don’t generally care about the significance of risk when going to the bathroom, because it’s such an ordinary thing with such an inherent safety to it, and yet at least a few people die of defecation syncope each year."
21033,"Extraordinarily rare, and interesting to people who study precisely that one thing, but makes up less than a fraction of a percentage of cases in less than a percentage of the population in less than a percentage of all bathroom visits in a given calendar year."
21034,"Sorry, maybe I’m using the wrong terminology; my point was merely that “getting a blood clot due to a vaccine” is so far down the list of OTHER things that can give you blood clots that it may as well not even make an appearance."
21035,"Clots occur in about 1 in 1000 people per year, vaccinated or not, so attributing this one particular clot to the vaccine is tenuous, at best (in my estimation).It’s like saying that TECHNICALLY, at any time, there is a non-zero risk that a crab could gain intelligence, learn to wield a knife and take you hostage, but the likelihood isn’t even worth bearing consideration in the grand scheme of things."
21036,"I’m honestly not even sure if these clots can be directly correlated with the vaccine, yet, given the low rate of incidence and the myriad other factors that could be causing it; I wonder if we’re just looking for it because it’s a possibility."
21037,"Like if you made a new cancer treatment drug and found a few patients with new tumors; is that because they took the drug, or because they already had cancer?"
21038,"I’m probably out of my element on this, though."
21039,"Fact is, I don’t think there’s cause for alarm."
21040,"Numbers and definitions aside, it’s still more likely that I choke on my lunch and die than that someone gets a blood clot from a vaccine."
21041,It could be only one last booster.
21042,"And it might even not be really needed as the mRNA vaccines do seem to give decent protection against current variants as well, as the spike protein they 'code' is in its prefusion form."

21050,Models&gt;reality eh?
21051,The regret for never getting a sequel to this movie.

21054,"Sure, is it disproportionate to prior hospitalization ratios?"
21055,Absolute case count is exploding in India.
21056,What news media are you watching that is terrifying you about vaccines out of curiosity
21057,Yeah studies are more important than your feelings and anecdotes.
21058,I think it's hard to say anything concrete about what we'll see in the data this week.
21059,"All the canceled J&amp;J appointments can't be rescheduled instantaneously, so that may be a piece of what's going on, especially given that every single J&amp;J shot would have been a first dose."
21060,"We also may be seeing people take a beat on all vaccine types as a result of the pause, but that doesn't mean they won't get them in another week or two."
21061,This.
21062,Last year the CDC lied about wearing masks because they were afraid of how people would react.
21063,How would people react if they came out and said something along the lines of thousands of people developing blood clots AFTER they gave the green flag.
21064,"You literally have millions of people walking around with this vaccine that people VOLUNTARILY took, because it was offered and highly encouraged by governments."
21065,What the hell kind of pandemonium would we see from the general public?
21066,So do you really believe that it was just 6 in however million?
21067,Really?
21068,Let’s not forget that a month ago there were 0 blood clot cases for J&amp;J.
21069,What numbers will we see 3 months from now?
21070,It’s going to trickle in over time.
21071,But hey go ahead and call me an antivaxxer conspiracy theorist.
21072,Good luck.
21073,Wasn't this study performed at Oxford?
21074,Didn't they have a hand in developing the AstraZeneca vaccine?
21075,Wouldn't that imply bias?
21076,I personally heavily favor vaccination and believe the occurrence rate is low enough that AZ Vax appears safe.
21077,That said I feel this study is borderline unethical due to conflicts of interest.
21078,&gt;Once the pandemic is over the vaccine passports will not be used anymore.
21079,lol
21080,"56.2% of *total* population vaccinated, 68.7% of 18+."
21081,How's that for a milestone?
21082,Pretty cool.
21083,Are there any other countries over there that are enjoying low case numbers in spite of vaccinations?
21084,[deleted]
21085,A date makes no sense.
21086,It should be pinned to either case rates or vaccination rates.
21087,"""Mask mandates end once \~70% of the population has been fully vaccinated"" makes sense."
21088,It gives the vaccine hesitant extra incentive to get a vaccine.
21089,"""Mask mandates end once daily case rates drop below 5 per 100,000"" makes perhaps even more sense - you can't spread or catch a disease if hardly anyone has it."
21090,AstraZeneca is half Swedish
21091,"&gt;we all were in and out in 20 minutes

Is that not standard?"
21092,Every time I've gotten a vaccine it's been quick
21093,I read several articles that said that cases in Michigan are overwhelmingly not in the 65+ group and that that seems to mean vaccines are working.
21094,The problem is that the variants are harder on young people than OG Rona.
21095,"Yes this 50,000 observationally study is more important than the lives of athletes who have been ruined by this disease."
21096,Good hill to die on.
21097,We must not subscribe to the same subs 🤷‍♂️
21098,The economic benefit of vaccinating domestically is far greater than exporting.
21099,Because it enables India to recover faster.
21100,Politically it also makes much more sense.
21101,I can't believe people reasonably expect India to give doses to countries with higher vaccination rates then themselves.
21102,that and the CDC study saying one dose after two weeks is 80% effective against any infection.
21103,"which was based on 4,000 health-care personnel, first responders and front-line workers"
21104,This is awesome  The Light At The end of the tunnel  is gettng bigger  you love to see it  Science is awesome
21105,There's also the fact that J&amp;J is similar to a normal flu vaccine where Moderna and Pfizer use mRNA
21106,"Trial data, Israel data, etc."
21107,[Here's](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577) a link to the trial.
21108,Also roughly 190M doses have been administered in the USA without any reports of significant side effects as per Fauci
21109,"UK woman here and I’d take whatever I’m given, this whole thing is being blown out of proportion."
21110,If only people gave this much of a shit about all the other medicine killing us 🙄
21111,What about taste as opposed to smell...
21112,"When I had it I don’t recall loss of smell so much, but to make a point to my wife I did the cliche “take a big bite out of a raw onion” and chewed it infront of her, as I really couldn’t taste anything."
21113,7 months on and it’s all but returned to normal...
21114,I think.
21115,Who are still selling the vaccine at cost until the pandemic is over.
21116,"&gt; those two countries contractually stipulated ""first dibs"" on a number of doses that must be first be delivered

All very true, and just to add, the EU has now put a similar clause for itself in its new big order with Pfizer, so the people inevitably coming to this topic making out that the EU is just too morally superior and selfless to do these things are kidding themselves."
21117,"The reason the EU doesn't have enough vaccines is because they screwed up the initial contracts, not it being too charitable for its own good."
21118,"The US donating Doses is a publicity stunt, they have been one of the most egoistical countries when it comes to vaccines"
21119,I consider 2% of the global population being removed something to worry about.
21120,What point would you start to care?
21121,5%?
21122,10%?
21123,25%?
21124,Would you be bothered by a Thanos snap?
21125,"Hmm, not sure how kids not getting flu shots has anything to do with not getting COVID shots?"
21126,... Covid is (1) not the flu.
21127,(2) you should also get a flu shot.
21128,Flu is pretty bad.
21129,"Not the ""grippaler Infect"" - but the real flu is really bad."
21130,"So, get flu shot - and COVID shot."
21131,This is all just empty promises by the US and it's coming very late.
21132,"Here this is from the abc article you just shared:

&gt;A senior administration official said Thursday that ""this pledge to COVAX does not impact the vaccination program in the United States at all."""
21133,"&gt;""While we're not able to share vaccine doses at this time while we're focused on American vaccinations and getting shots into arms,"" the official said, ""we're working hard to support COVAX, strengthen global vaccination around the world and determining the timeline for when we will have a sufficient supply in the United States and be able to donate surplus vaccines."""
21134,"&gt;China and Russia, meanwhile, have donated doses of their homegrown COVID-19 vaccines to partners and developing countries as a form of ""vaccine diplomacy."""
21135,The United States has not yet followed suit.
21136,Does a blood clot cause immediate death.
21137,"What are symptoms, how are they treated?"
21138,It would be good to bring awareness to this so people can still get vaccinated.
21139,Humans aren’t immortal but together we can take the steps to live longer.

You and I must be using a different “Reddit”."

21143,"(had to re-edit my post, forgot to put ""Massachusetts"" as I normally do)

The target I'm more looking at is when the 62% of the general population has dose 1 and 58% fully vaccinated."
21144,At that point we would surpass where Israel slowed down significantly in vaccine distribution and cases nosedived.
21145,Right now the target for ~60% overall fully vaccinated with all doses looks like early to mid June (barring the Janssen vaccine being paused now).
21146,Was the original data signal for an association between AZ vaccine and clots peer reviewed?
21147,Same with /r/coronavirus
21148,That population number is interesting.
21149,"In my home state (Washington), we have about 7.5M people and about 7 daily deaths as well."
21150,"As a (presumably) healthy, unvaccinated four-year-old, your son has lower odds of severe COVID than you do as fully vaccinated adults."
21151,The risk in the scenario is really of your parents getting it from your child and getting severe disease themselves.
21152,"Of course, if they are taking no precautions anyway, adding the risk of your son to their continuous risk-taking isn't going to make any difference."
21153,"On the other hand, you have to consider the effect it would have on you if your son got it, you allowed them to see him, he transmitted it to your parents, and then they died."
21154,Even if they consented to the risk and were doing riskier things every day.
21155,The choice is yours.
21156,Yep.
21157,Better to have variant boosters ready and not need them than need them and not have them.
21158,Was it ever worth it?
21159,Are you suggesting that the experts are lying about the current situation?
21160,"&gt;Researchers said the risk of passengers being exposed to the virus from an infected person on the plane could be reduced by 23% to 57% if middle seats are empty, compared with a full flight."
21161,"Okay, but how many outbreaks are being linked to flights?"
21162,That reduction in risk doesn't mean much in the real world if the infection rate on planes is [already small](https://www.vox.com/21525068/covid-19-airplane-risk-coronavirus-pandemic-airports).
21163,"A decrease from 100,000 to 50,000 or a decrease from 10 to 5 can both be called a ""50 percent decrease,"" but most people can recognize those are two very different measurements."
21164,"I wonder if this can be used as a preventative measure, like face masks."
21165,"For crowded indoor  situations, people would use the nasal spray as a sort of virus condom."
21166,Maybe they can also come up with a mouthwash with similar abilities.
21167,"With an antibody test this is possible, but more work than just giving a booster."
21168,The most fascinating fact on this is that they had to do so until now.
21169,"Not only is that pointless in the first place, but to have such a mandate in a country where most so many people have been vaccinated is just beyond absurd."
21170,The cult of the cloth however is strong even there.
21171,"""Earlier Thursday, the Biden administration’s Covid response chief science officer David Kessler said Americans should expect to receive booster shots to protect against coronavirus variants. """
21172,"It can be treated like a math problem but the problem is most redditors are really bad at math to the point where it seems purposefully wrong, probably because general/surface-level statistics usually point to the outcome they desire while getting more specific/smarter leads to a contradictory outcome."
21173,"Instead of 6 out of 7 million, you cut that population into subsets."
21174,"One woman in her 20s got a dangerous blood clot out of X (which is less than 7 million, let's say it's 100 to be extreme) women in their 20s who got the vaccine."
21175,In this case you've gone from a probability that's extremely small to a 1% chance.
21176,Now you compare that to the probability of a blood clot from covid for a woman in her 20s.
21177,"If it's lower than 1%, then it is safer to get covid than get the vaccine for women in their 20s when it comes to blood clots."
21178,"The 6 out of 7 million isn't incorrect, but it is misleading."
21179,"It's an example of ""lies, damned lies, and statistics""."
21180,It's the churches more than the schools for this particular issue.
21181,"I went to high school in Alabama and people would put down the answers needed to pass tests to get into college,  but they knew the real truth about things like natural selection, because they learned it in church."
21182,Honest question: why the hostility?
21183,We need as many people comfortable taking a COVID vaccine as possible.
21184,Isn’t demonstrating that any dangers will be dealt with swiftly and thoroughly a good thing?
21185,"Public health officials understand that, you were willing to listen to public health officials as they spent the past year informing you of the benefits of things like masks and lockdowns, why is a pause in distributing this vaccine where you decide you know more than them?"
21186,"Because while we should track both, the first shot metric is the one that matters most?"
21187,"Second shots is just a measure of where first shots were a month ago, and first shots are what provides the vast majority of protection."
21188,"So if you’re trying to decide if it’s safe to open up a state, or to go out to a restaurant, that’s the metric that matters."

21266,A crucial factor now is time from start to finish of vaccinations as we try to get to the point COVID is infecting so few people chances of significant mutation decrease and potentially it gets stopped dead in it's tracks.
21267,The last thing we need is a variant the vaccines aren't effective against.
21268,can you give a link?
21269,[removed]
21270,Just want to say sorry for what this has done to you mentally
21271,Or that covid isn't real.
21272,My uncle was one of them.
21273,Constantly said he had it in November because if a sore throat.
21274,Contracted actual covid and got super sick.
21275,He at least admits he was wrong now.
21276,Not sure (any North American-based news channels/sources) should be considered a source of information for holier-than-thous but ok... 🥱🤫
21277,"Because, at least in my country, they went exactly against a lot of advise from actual experts in the last weeks."
21278,Furthermore the European medical association also said to continue to use the vaccine because it's benefits far outweigh the risks.
21279,"Not that part, the part in which it may still be possible to catch a mild version of covid and spread it to others who aren't vaccinated"
21280,"I've got no idea when they're going to drop off, and unless I misspoke I don't believe I made an estimate on when we'll get below 547, which was the July 7 seven day average."
21281,"If I had to make a rough estimate, I think we'll see it get well below that number in early May, but I've got no idea- This stuff is practically chaos theory in action."
21282,The majority of people I know refusing the vaccine are the least healthy people I know.
21283,RIP.
21284,"That is interesting, would be a great inference if true."
21285,I guess once they know what causes it they can better advise.
21286,"Risk with any drug, even standard pain killers."
21287,Wonder if the J&amp;J has the same issue because they use similar technology.
21288,"I've been fully vaccinated for a while now and I really follow it because I'm interested in how thing progress, sentiment, and of course, when things can reopen."
21289,I think it's in everyone's best interest to help the other countries.
21290,"Vaccine hesitancy will be here by summer, at which point we'll have plenty to share."
21291,So... are you recommending we reinstate prima nocta?
21292,"Yup, my mom is a nurse in a hospital and didn't get her first dose until December 30."
21293,If it was a small practice there's no way they were prioritized that early.
21294,It’s the gosh darn trolley problem isn’t it?
21295,Uh oh

21302,I dunno.

21305,"I still think it will get above 50% of adults complying, so hopeful that will be enough with natural infection immunity, but I think there are going to continue to be pockets of the country where this shit is always prevalent"

21310,"I said:

&gt; chances you will get COVID before a safer vaccine is available?"
21311,"Might be less than 1/8

Doesn't that address your point?"

21314,“It seems strong but there is some waning of that and no doubt the variants challenge ... they make these vaccines work harder.
21315,"So I think for planning purposes, planning purposes only, I think we should expect that we may have to boost.”"
21316,In theory yes.
21317,I think the reality is that it will probably be done based on classification of individuals primarily based on age and/or comorbidities.
21318,People who are over the age of 55 are losing their antibodies about three times as fast compared with people who are younger
21319,Thanks for actually reading the article.
21320,It sounds as if the word “likely” was said by him in response to a question asked about boosters and the need for yearly shots.
21321,"He said it’s likely the case that boosters would be needed for variants, but as you said, he later clarified that this was for planning purposes."
21322,They wouldn’t be making boosters if they didn’t believe they were possibly necessary.
21323,It's hard not to notice the insane amount of vaccine privilege we have here.
21324,In my area we have essentially unlimited supply of the mRNA vaccines and we are begging people to get them.
21325,"Loads of mobile vaccine sites in neighborhoods everywhere, easy to get appointments, etc."
21326,I feel incredibly lucky and thankful but it's hard not to feel sad for others around the world waiting their turn.

21348,Walgreens was definitely asking people for their insurance cards when I went there.
21349,Nah months ago you could see a slight increase in the study J&amp;J released.
21350,It was such a small difference though.
21351,Weird that governments are concerned now but weren't then.
21352,"Obviously because someone died, but that data isn't really any different now as far as I can tell."
21353,"Mask usage will be lower when it’s no longer required because that’s peoples’ nature it was in the beginning of pandemic and it will still be as it ends 


People not wearing masks are not just the vaccinated people— we all saw the social experiments before last month with states doing away with national mask mandates &amp; opening up stadiums &amp; consequently having surge of young adults hospitalized from b17 :c 

It would be great if the vaccines and masks went hand-in-hand, but the vaccinations are not reaching levels of herd immunity since the anti-maskers overlap a lot as anti-vaxxers; plus we don’t know how long the vaccine will last without a booster/the potential variants that could still come about cuz virus’ are living things that evolve

People that are concerned about the virus &amp; listen to the guidelines from scientists instead of business or politicians are still wearing masks out &amp; about; it’s great the CDC said it’s safe to not wear masks inside even with fully vaccinated people so you should absolutely allow yourself that comfort with close ones!"
21354,"However, wearing a mask isn’t going to become a thing of the past in the next half year based on what they’re asking people to continue practicing until more of population is fully vaccinated (and for things like planes, who knows how long depending on airline &amp; their country’s vaxxed-pop %)."

21356,I’ll join your anxiety party.
21357,36F and got the jj on the 11th.
21358,Doing my best to stay distracted!
21359,!
21360,It's quite reassuring to see that Moderna and Pfizer manage to more than compensate for J&amp;J's troubles.
21361,"If this pace keeps up, we could reach 300 million doses by mid-May and 400 million by the beginning of Summer (taking into account decreasing demand after May when all states have opened up to all adults)."
21362,"Of course, we could see a boost due to adolescents being vaccinated if the FDA lowers the minimum age of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines."
21363,AZ is safe and should be used widely.
21364,Compare the threat off death from the virus to the threat of death from COVID.
21365,This is not a useful comparison.
21366,"When you do, you’ll see the death rates are 1-2 out of 100 for COVID and around 1 in 1,000,000 for AZ."
21367,Damn.
21368,I'm not in Canada but have my second one scheduled for two weeks from now.
21369,I haven't heard any changes so hopefully I'll still be getting it in 14 days.
21370,No I meant 6 weeks from 1st to fully vaccinated.
21371,It's 4 weeks from 1st shot.
21372,Then 2 weeks after is when you're supposed to be fully protected.
21373,I probably could had worded that better.
21374,"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00762-5/fulltext

Article referenced"
21375,Did you even read my comment lol.
21376,"We can keep pretending this is a math problem but in reality it’s going to cause problems in in a high risk group way more often then the general public, but for some reason everyone keeps talking about statistics involving the general public which are irrelevant to the discussion."
21377,"Had I known about this possible side effect earlier, I’d have gone with a Pfizer or Moderna because that risk would have turned into a nonexistent one."
21378,"The real damage from the J&amp;J vaccine being shelved is that it is one shot, which means it is *extremely* valuable in reaching herd immunity by allowing public health officials to vaccinate people on the spot: they can go door-to-door, set up mobile vaccination sites, etc."
21379,"NYC was looking to use the J&amp;J vaccine this way, to allow underserved, impoverished, and otherwise difficult-to-vaccinate populations vaccinated."
21380,"But in that case, why state that it's ""likely""?"
21381,"People have already extrapolated the decay in antibody titers and T-cells, and have even speculated that immunity could last for years."
21382,Why do you think deaths are going to take that long to drop off?
21383,We're already at nearly 50% of adults vaccinated and the majority of the ones that are left are young and healthy.
21384,Would they be able to detect who needs an extra booster and who doesn't per individual?
21385,Seems like the zoo would be a place where people can be pretty crowded together.
21386,aren't colds and flus mainly spread through surfaces?
21387,"I'd have to imagine not touching your face and handwashing, far lesser burdens than masks played a large role."
21388,"People having to isolate with symptoms was probably another factor, no ones really going out coughing and sneezing."
21389,Cool.
21390,Just tell me where and when fam.
21391,"I'll be honest, I might just wear a mask out while doing shopping/etc forever because I haven't caught so much as a cold since I started wearing one"
21392,Someone grab the Hypospray.
21393,&gt; If people want to not wear them once vaccination rates go up I don't care.
21394,This is the KEY SENTENCE here.
21395,I have absolutely no problem with people who want to wear masks for as long as they like; more power to you.
21396,But once cases numbers are down I don't want people giving ME crap for not wearing a mask when I'm fully vaccinated and not a threat to anyone.
21397,Not sure FoxNews should be considered a source of information but ok...
21398,My absolute most optimistic scenario that I'd consider even somewhat realistic would be eighty percent of adults.
21399,I would be *shocked* for it to go any higher.

21433,The vaccine is free and becoming available in a building on like every other block that you can have done in like 20 minutes and have time off from work mandated to do it.
21434,A drivers license or other government ID is none of those things.
21435,That is the only gripe against voter ID.
21436,That's like putting on a seat belt *after* a crash that throws you through the windshield.
21437,Yeah my gym has been open since ~August.
21438,"I live at home right now with my mom and she was my main concern, so I chose not to go."
21439,"I was fortunate enough to buy a Peloton, then found powerblocks for a normal price."
21440,"But I was making so much progress at the gym pre-pandemic and missed the heavier weight and bigger, compound movements."
21441,So awesome to be back now.
21442,Some kids have gotten sick and died of diseases for the entirety of human history.
21443,"Using your logic that even 1 death is too many, we will need to have schoolchildren wear masks forever, since it may save children from dying from the flu, etc."
21444,"It’s like some of you don’t understand that there are other diseases, some even deadly, out there besides Covid."
21445,Absolute insanity.
21446,Do you have that aspirin study because all I can find is a 12% reduction in mortality for those in hospital?
21447,"Good, but not 50%."
21448,And based on a new study NSAIDs are all about timing.
21449,Additionally an Israeli study is shining light saying that aspirin could lower covid infection ability which is awesome.
21450,"Worth noting that the UK right now is about 2500 new cases each day, which is half what that graphics ""low exposure risk"" is (incidence of 2 in 10,000 per day - roughly the UK in March 2021)

For younger people, it's a no-brainer really."
21451,Just wait for a mRNA vaccine instead.
21452,Why not just take all the money it will cost to put this thing on and donate that?
21453,Evil Merkel used population as test subject until it is deemed safe enough for her.
21454,~tabloids probably
21455,Hopefully it would tear down some of the walls the anti-vaxxers are building.
21456,They probably think covid caused the protein S deficiency.
21457,Covid has caused some health problems for people that led to other issues.
21458,Like the broadway performer that lost his leg and eventually died after covid
21459,One thing to remember is that Covid-19 virus would not be eradicated.
21460,It will always be there and it can always come back.
21461,"So, if we didn't have the vaccines, it would have been a near certainty that you would eventually get infected in your lifetime."
21462,We will keep the future epidemics of Covid-19 from happening by constantly vaccinating as many people as possible.
21463,"That is the only way an unvaccinated person can avoid catching it even once, herd immunity."
21464,"So, then, the choice between side effects and vaccine will always be there for most people"
21465,Clotting and bleeding are kind of on both ends of the risk spectrum.
21466,I believe the problems are the clots and best treatment methods for them.
21467,"That’s fair, that’s what awesome about freedom of choice I respect your reasoning for getting it"
21468,"I agree with you in principle, but prefer a metrics-based endpoint to a date in the sand."
21469,"Unfortunately I don't recall there are too many places that have etched out metrics for ending mask mandates either, but there are definitely some - Michigan, for instance, I think was targeting 70% vaccine rollout."
21470,"Utah had one based on vaccine availability that might even have been met already, and Colorado is allowing county-by-county based on running totals of the total weekly caseload."
21471,"The problem, as you mentioned, is with the ""it's just not safe *yet*"" approach."
21472,When it lacks other details it's basically just licking your finger and sticking it in the wind.
21473,"And since we all know this virus is going to become endemic, there will always be a way to contrive some way why it's still ""not safe"" yet."
21474,"My personal point to watch for is if we start seeing U.S. nationwide daily average new caseload under 20,000, deaths under 200, and vaccinations over 60%."
21475,That's the point beyond which we're potentially edging into post-pandemic mask mandates and it becomes justifiable IMO to start ignoring them in certain settings.
21476,"Basically if we start seeing headlines about how XX metric is at its lowest level since March 2020, it ought to be the beginning of the death knell for mask mandates."
21477,Tens of thousands of people every year also die from Covid or the common cold.
21478,We still shut down the US for nothing
21479,"I seriously doubt they will be held accountable, all the legality documents are online, you actually think these people won’t loophole themselves out of liability?"
21480,It’s the way of the world to be honest
21481,It would be impossible to generalize.
21482,It would depend on the concentration of virus to begin with and how often the air is replaced.
21483,"Typically an air current in an enclosed space means that air is being drawn from an outside source, so the amount of virus would fall as new air replaces it."
21484,A room with very little air flow would be more concerning.
21485,"As a Brazilian, I think the headline can be a bit shocking and not very informative."
21486,The situations is p1 variant spreads easier and so it has as there isn't a national effort to face Covid here.
21487,This lack of effort has resulted in ICU units above 90% capacity in many states.
21488,Governors are making mixed decisions to face Covid.
21489,"As an example, São Paulo state has closed shopping centers, gyms and not essential services/stores."
21490,"At the same time, even with hospitals full, it wants to reopen schools and reduce other restrictions."
21491,"The problem is that due to the lack of restrictions the virus can keep spreading, replicating and that's how mutations are born."
21492,"If a variant is resistant to vaccines, then we have a new and even worse situation to face."
21493,With Biontech i guess.
21494,AZ is allowed for people over 60
21495,Had a discussion with a coworker and he was blaming it on the Vaccine trials and media covering it up!
21496,Had to walk away from the coffee table!
21497,There’s an effective treatment for blood clots too..
21498,Ya but the risk is so marginal for young people does it really matter lol.
21499,People with the vaccine can still spread it ffs.
21500,"Idk I’ve got vaccines before but this one they can shove up their ass, they made so much money off us with these vaccines it makes me sick"
21501,"very true, a lot of people are just inherently distrustful of anything medical because in the back of your mind you're like ""well fuck, this is probably gonna be big bill""

i go through it myself, always question going to doctor/dentist/etc because i'm wondering how much it is going to cost

it's really an awful, awful system"
21502,"If you’re in a hospital environment with positive patients being given breathing treatments or receiving mechanical ventilation, airborne particles can survive minutes to hours."
21503,Real world settings are unlikely to have airborne spread.
21504,"The droplets expelled as infected people cough, talk, or exhale drop fairly quickly (this is why staying 6ft apart is recommended) and can project farther when yelling, singing, or forcefully coughing/sneezing."
21505,"Droplet viability and infectiousness will also be dependent on other factors like humidity, air flow, air filtration, and air quality."
21506,Surface transmission is very rare.
21507,How come we never heard about blood clots from COVID before the AstraZeneca vaccine came out?
21508,Thank you.
21509,I read and re-read the headline and article since it made little sense to me.
21510,[removed]
21511,I go to a small gym and it has been open or mostly open in one form or another throughout the pandemic.
21512,"We had restrictions on group classes, how many people at once, but as a small gym it's rarely more than a few people at a time and very easy to socially distance, like 10-20 feet apart."
21513,Sometimes we do some or all of the workouts outside.
21514,"They have extra cleaning crews come through, everyone wipes everything down, etc."
21515,"It has been an absolute life saver for me, getting out of the house, exercising, a little bit of social interaction, and some sense of normalcy."
21516,Honestly I am not sure what I would have done without it.
21517,Because your government offers you no alternative
21518,Great summary on in person school.
21519,Our elementary school has been in person all year with zero cases of transmission.
21520,It can be done safely with young kids and the right protocol in place.
21521,In person education is essential for children and should be looked at that way.
21522,"This doesn’t seem to look at the gender dimension, though, does it?"
21523,Have there been many male blood clot cases?
21524,"I think looking at women only, the risk from clots might be close to double."
21525,"As a woman in my 30s who can work from home indefinitely, I’m not very excited about getting AZ."
21526,But since I’m in the U.K.
21527,I don’t think I’ll get a choice.
21528,Is there any data on your odds of getting COVID?
21529,That should be included in the rate for those who get COVID.
21530,"I’m not smart enough to to calculate this, hoping someone else can."
21531,Stonks!
21532,"No Joke, that's clever!"
21533,"Well, that sounds terrible."
21534,I was told to hydrate before both to help eliminate side effects.
21535,I'm going to tell myself if I do this I won't get leg cramps even though I have no proof.
21536,"I have a history of leg cramps, they aren't fun, and I go for my second shot a week from today."
21537,"I received AZ a month ago, just as all the EU countries were pausing it."
21538,"At first I was worried, just as I got my vaccination appointment, NL and denmark paused AZ."
21539,More countries followed later that day.
21540,"But in the end, after consulting with doctors and realizing that ONLY EU countries were pausing a UK vaccine (which btw had like twice as many orders as the next most ordered vaxx), I've accepted that this is all political bullshit done by the EU suits."
21541,"Even the EU healthcare professionals tried convincing them how stupid it is to pause vaccinations, but I guess the big pharma paid big bucks to the decisionmakers."
21542,"It's big money we're talking here, billions of doses."
21543,"I'm saying all of this with my tinfoil hat on, but cmon, it was painfully obvious that this was an anti-UK move dressed up as a wellbeing concern."
21544,And the result?
21545,"Preventable deaths, delayed opening up of countries, and more money to the pfizer guys."
21546,"Nice going EU, suck a bag of dicks."
21547,Never wore it outdoors at all.
21548,Outdoor transmission is very rare.
21549,So the public healthcare comes from your taxes right?
21550,No one actually has to pay for it?
21551,So many people choose the private option since you’re paying for the public option regardless (unless you don’t work)
21552,"Right, which is why they compare the vaccinated group to the placebo group, assuming equal exposure in the large."
21553,Mask usage is already down to 50 percent in the Walmart I got vaccinated in in SC.
21554,I wish that it was higher than that.
21555,Now that I'm fully vaccinated I'm probably going to continue to wear some type of mask (but not necessarily a headband style medical equivalent mask at all times) but will allow myself to not wear one around vaccinated friends and family or while dining in restaurants/bars eventually.
21556,Vaccine acceptance i.e.
21557,"how many people have taken the vaccine once they've been offered it, not how many people have actually had the jab yet."
21558,Good one
21559,This post appears to be about vaccines.

21562,*
21563,That is a very fair point.
21564,"I dont even think its ""elitists""."
21565,"In a country with a high infection rate and no available alternatives, any working vaccine is a huge benefit."
21566,In a country with a low infection rate / available alternatives it might look different.
21567,I don't think the problem is just who ppl assume are the usual suspects.
21568,From what I have seen is that there are a lot of ppl that are just plain scared.
21569,I think over time ppl will follow the lead of ppl they know and trust.
21570,"I was nervous getting my first shot, but I felt comfort in knowing that trusted family members have gotten the shot."
21571,This whole blame game has got to stop.
21572,Selfish?
21573,So when do you propose lockdown ends?
21574,Did you...read?
21575,There was one point and one point only.
21576,"&gt;Viruses are complicated and single data points mean

Unless you think viruses are easy can the approach can be the literal same everywhere and anywhere?"
21577,basically.
21578,My life.
21579,I'm gonna risk or not risk it how I please.
21580,"You may say its selfish, but to me, my life is more important than yours is."
21581,99% of people feel the same way about their own lives even if they won't admit it.
21582,People claiming otherwise are just being performative.
21583,Same for me.
21584,"If it settles onto a surface it's no longer in the air, no?"
21585,Airborne transmission (infection via smaller particles that remain suspended in the air) is relatively rare.
21586,Whether or not it's a viable source of infection depends on the circumstance—so enclosed spaces with high concentrations of virus and poor ventilation.
21587,A sealed room where an infected person does rigorous exercise for an hour could remain a significant risk of exposure for hours after that person left whereas a room with open windows where an infected person sits quietly for fifteen minutes would be low risk almost immediately after they've left.
21588,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/scientific-brief-sars-cov-2.html
21589,Shoot I've scheduled mine and my dad's numerous times.
21590,Our county simple can't get its shit together.
21591,The study showed Pfizer had almost the same occurrence of blood clots.
21592,So it's not really any better.
21593,Agreed.
21594,"I think they marginally help, but, the rate of new cases kept falling after Texas lifted the mask mandates in March 10th."
21595,The main driver of new cases are small household gatherings which are hard to restrict.
21596,Over a sufficient time scale you should assume everyone will “get” covid .
21597,You also have to consider the ethical circumstances.
21598,There's a difference in knowingly subjecting a healthy person compared to a hypothetical risk if catching a disease.
21599,"As of right now, New Hampshire is the only state that has more than half of its total population vaccinated with at least one dose."
21600,I guess Sununu saw Israel’s success after they achieved 50% total population vaccinated and is banking on ending up like them.
21601,I hope that’s the case.
21602,Cries in American English
21603,"Meh, at least we understand that nothing is free."
21604,"Could it be that your healthcare facility has changed its rules about what types of masks are acceptable, and your boss didn't tell you?"
21605,"My healthcare facility now has all employees (does not matter what type of role) where a surgical mask or respirator mask (which they are collectively calling ""barrier masks"") when they are required to wear a mask."
21606,They no longer allow cloth masks when masking is required.
21607,This is a change implemented later in 2020 in this facility.
21608,"&gt;That's a very straight forward statement

And very vague, and still not confirming that the situation is ""dramatic""."
21609,&gt; Who are you to question the health care workers' feelings?
21610,"If this is about health care workers' feelings, then a situation can be called dramatic even with only 10 people in the hospital, or in turn it can be called only slightly concerning with much higher figures."
21611,"My point is exactly that it's interesting to see how different places and countries interpret the word ""dramatic"" in this context."
21612,If only it was the same for voting!
21613,[deleted]
21614,on a large scale that makes sense but why would a 20 year old take the risk over just getting covid.
21615,I dont know the numbers but isnt the probability of death Pretty close?
21616,As in 20 year old dying from clot and dying from covid
21617,"This is true but with a placebo group, and with randomization and double blinding (so no one can choose or know which vaccine they got), the large trial groups would have been exposed at the same rate on average."
21618,So the reduction in cases is attributable to the vaccine.
21619,&gt; Its a matter of risk assessment.
21620,In most circumstances the asseseemnt will recommned taking AZ.
21621,But not in all.
21622,"So 1 in every 200,000 people might experience blood clots?"
21623,"I mean, I have a way better chance of getting into a car accident on my way to work."
21624,The risk assessment tells me I'll probably be fine...
21625,I mean it seems to be very anti-capitalism to give the patent which is owned by the companies that developed it out without an agreement with the companies.
21626,Kinda removes the incentive for companies to develop vaccines if they lose their profit by governments giving the designs away.
21627,"Personally I think the patent should Not be given out, and we should ramp up vaccine production and dole it out to the 3rd world countries first."
21628,"Europe has Astra Zenica (which has been used to great success by the UK, with less than 0.001% having issues) so stopping it is just ludicrous."
21629,So they have all these vaccines just sitting there without any obligation to keep them in house (like the US does with the contracts with Pfizer and Moderna) so they can dole them out as needed.
21630,But they aren't.
21631,"India is producing vaccines amazingly fast, they just have 1.3 billion people so no amount of vaccines is going to stop the surge they are going through."
21632,"Africa and other 3rd world nations (like Brazil for instance) have no vaccine program to make their own, and no facilities to do so should they acquire the design."
21633,So it is countries like this that the USA should help out first.
21634,The ones that are the biggest threats because of variants popping out of the woodwork.
21635,"Haemorrhoids are result of inflamed veins, not ""thicker blood"" or whatever."
21636,There is no relation with blood clots.
21637,"No, AZ incompetence in production got EU in trouble."
21638,They have repeteadly promised reduced targets and failed to deliver those reduced targets.
21639,They are about 100 mil doses under what they have promised.
21640,A lot of countries want those.
21641,Just donate them to the COVAX facility

21646,"And vaccines work much, much better."
21647,"We see lots of news articles saying things like “0.0008% of fully vaccinated people still end up hospitalized with covid”, but never anything on how many doubly, 100%, N95-masked people still end up getting seriously ill from covid, and there’s a reason for that (and it’s not just that vaccination happens to be easier to track than mask-wearing)"
21648,This is my thought but at the same time I feel like countries such as Norway would have dealt with Pfizer the same as az if they had the same blood clot problem over there.
21649,Like Norway isn't as corrupt Hey lol
21650,"I think realistically it will only resume if we'll get another big wave, or if we can single out segments in the younger population with less risk for these side effects."

21663,Vox made a video about this topic that’s worth a watch.
21664,https://youtu.be/34oI0yd5YUc
21665,I have a couple of questions about the topic of vaccines and such.
21666,I've been a good boy since last March.
21667,"Masked up, social distanced, sanitized, worked from home during lockdown, etc... My wife is a nurse and was vaccinated around Christmas time."
21668,I just got my 2nd Pfizer shot last week.
21669,I guess I'm just confused about what the next steps are going to be and what the endgame is.
21670,1) At what point in % of the eligible population vaccinated are we going to open back up and end mask mandates?
21671,We'll never reach 100% vaccination because of stupidity or religious exemption or health reasons or whatever.
21672,I thought from the beginning they were saying this is a virus we'll have to live with forever like the flu.
21673,I didn't think the goal was ever to try and irradicate it completely.
21674,"Since the beginning, it was always ""slow the spread"", ""don't overwhelm the hospitals"", ""protect the vulnerable""."
21675,All of those have been done.
21676,2) Correct me if I'm wrong but all we know about the vaccines is that they are very good protection from getting deathly ill.
21677,"They don't keep you from contracting it or spreading it, right?"
21678,"If that's the case, why are ""vaccine passes"" a thing?"
21679,"I've heard a lot of statements that by June or July we'll have so many people vaccinated here in the US that we can have sporting events, concerts, etc... again but if they can still spread it around that doesn't make sense."
21680,"Also, if they don't prevent you from contracting and spreading then why does anyone who's not high-risk NEED to get it?"
21681,"Conversely, if they do keep you from contracting and spreading then why aren't you able to go back to normal after a few weeks after your final shot?"
21682,You can't have it both ways.
21683,Vaccines don't prevent infection.
21684,They prevent serious illness.
21685,But that would've fueled vaccine reluctance as well.
21686,Not very reliable in my opinion.
21687,It all all about public image.
21688,I would not be so upset with them if they admitted mistakes are being made in this whole process instead of them trying to give everything a positive spin.
21689,Don't have to be a 'corona gekkie to see that Rutte/De Jonge are career liars.

21709,Pardon?
21710,"Despite the growing number of COVID cases, states in the USA have and are opening up."
21711,"I expect that no one will ""shutdown"" (rollback) until it's far too late."
21712,See Brazil.
21713,I don't remember reading or hearing anywhere that it was 2 and done.
21714,Everything was presented as 2 shots to achieve the efficacy they'd promised.
21715,It's always been understood some sort of booster would be needed.
21716,That's not such a big figure considering EU's population
21717,Is that something they've said or is it just an assumption?
21718,I think the media likes to portray their own opinion on people.
21719,I think the truth here is that a lot of people don’t trust the new vaccines because they were rushed by the FDA.
21720,These were all given the express lane.
21721,Now reports of vaccines that were rushed are giving people health problems.
21722,People don’t feel safe taking these vaccines.
21723,"And that is 7 weeks delay for people under the age of 45, for anyone older the delay will be only a couple of weeks max."
21724,There's no herd immunity when 40% of the population refuse to take vaccine.
21725,The infections will still go around and more deadly strains will develop and we'll start the cycle all over again.
21726,Florida had a spike thanks to Spring break.
21727,Those kids are moving around and infect others.
21728,Different types of blood blots.
21729,"Oh, I agree - this is what I meant by the herd immunity infuence bit."
21730,"AZ is a separate chain from other companies, it is an extra amount that does not diminish overall production."
21731,If Pfitzer JJ or others could produce more  they would.
21732,These are separate companies that will not share their technology and process with others.
21733,"AZ also doesn't require as low temperature for storage, making it a great supplement for less affluent countries - mine is using Pfitzer, Modena and AZ."
21734,"AZ is available always, the other two have spotty availability and not as much can be stored and not all places can afford appropriate storage at all, so AZ for us makes sure the vaccinations are rolled out without pauses and with wider coverage."

Novavax is also working on a booster but I don’t believe it’s in trials yet

21756,*
21757,I'm starting to think the vaccine is amazing at preventing illness in your normal day to day life.
21758,"Work, grocery shopping etc."
21759,"But might not be quite as good if your just forced to live with someone who has it, in close daily contact ."
21760,&gt;How would you get to that conclusion?
21761,"Especially since Pfizer/Biontech did not even take any upfront money for development of the vaccine or infrastructure, except 500 Million € from the EU and Germany, that as far as i know, had no sort of exclusivity attached."
21762,Because Pfizer/BnT know they can sell the vaccine to whomever they please and not be forced to distribute it to who needs it the most at the price they can afford to pay.
21763,&gt;Think this through.
21764,Everyone has this brilliant idea to simply pay what Israel did.
21765,Everyone simply pays more.
21766,"Instead of 50 billion profit, Pfizer now makes 100 Billion

That hasn't happened, and Canada is where they are in line because they waited too long to make a deal, not because they refused to pay a premium out of principle."
21767,Your frothing at the mouth commentary shows you have never read The Guardian
21768,"We have downvotes, at least."
21769,"But everything should be read critically, which is why college is so important outside of career training."
21770,"It should be standard for all citizens, so we have a population that knows how to critically think."
21771,Not surprised by that as well.
21772,I think the same thing would've happened without the pause.
21773,"If the vaccines don’t carry long term immunity and require a booster, than your risk of getting COVID if you choose not to vaccinate is basically 100% over time"
21774,Interesting that NH has not been a Covid hotspot then!
21775,"It's not even slightly elevated, those numbers are worse than homeopathic."
21776,"If the vaccine actively causes blood clots, and we're not dealing with confounding factors like pregnancy or, y'know, being alive and not getting enough movement all day long, guess what, it's the evidence for it actually having an acute effect on people is really, really thin."
21777,"Not saying caution should go second, but talking about occurences per million is just ridiculous."
21778,Both my husband and I are vaccinated and we have a 20 month old.
21779,She has been fully vaccinated with every vaccine offered from birth until now.
21780,I am in no way antivaxx.
21781,I believe in science and trust vaccines.
21782,I’ve had many discussions with her pediatrician whom I trust 100% and he echos my thoughts on the matter.
21783,The risk of covid for children is low.
21784,"True, we don’t know the long term effects."
21785,But we also don’t know how they will react to the vaccine.
21786,There is a lot of uncertainty.
21787,I was willing to gamble getting the vaccine myself  but that’s not something I’m willing to do with my child until there’s more data.
21788,"The vaccine could cause long term harm, we don’t even know the long term effects for adults yet if there are any."
21789,This is a completely new class of vaccines.
21790,"For now, I’m doing my part by being vaccinated and continuing to wear masks and distance myself from others which in turn keeps my daughter safe."
21791,She’s never around anyone that’s not vaccinated at this point.
21792,"If she were in daycare or school, I may feel differently but to me her risk is low."
21793,&gt;why take that risk when there are readily available alternatives?
21794,"Once there are alternatives readily available, I have no problem to opt for Pfizer."
21795,"The problem is that unlike in the food sector, where multiple alternatives are readily available (if I know that my salami contains listeria, I can even eat my bread plain), with Covid vaccines, the only alternative to vaccination is no vaccination and being in danger from Covid infection every day."
21796,"&gt; In the US, it's pretty much ""not take the J&amp;J vaccine and get Pfizer/Moderna within a few weeks""."
21797,"Yeah, but not in Europe, and that's where the controversy surrounding this vaccine is having the worst effects."
21798,"Sorry if this has already been said, or doesn't hold water, but my takeaway from this is that if this clot is more likely to be caused by COVID than the vaccine, then isn't it more likely that the documented cases of it [edit for clarity: in people who have had the vaccine] were caused by COVID not the vaccine?"
21799,"After all, the vaccine isn't 100% effective."
21800,So doesn't it throw the whole basis for the caution about the vaccine into doubt?
21801,nb I haven't read the article yet so sorry if I'm saying something without value.
21802,It looks like the incidence increase vs the typical backround 3-4 cases of CVT per million people is BARELY increased at all by getting the AZ vaccine.
21803,To the point that it actually may not even be affecting results.
21804,"I guess what i'm saying is, vaccine or not, this many people have CVT per 1 million."
21805,While with covid the incidence goes from 3-4 cases to 39 cases per 1 million.
21806,"What this does tell us, however, is that they're being cautious either way, so not only is it safe, it's even more safe because they look into every reported instance of major problems."
21807,Let's get to the bigger issue.
21808,"The fact that news sources are reporting things before they should be reported with any kind of confirmation as an issue, resulting in massive effects to society as a whole."
21809,"As someone with a hereditary clotting disorder I am so fucking glad I got a different vaccine

people annoyed with the attention the clotting is getting should realize this stuff matters to lots of people, it’s literally life and death"
21810,I'm shocked that Pfizer would deny this finding
21811,"""watch what they do, not what they say"" is such a stupid mentality."
21812,You're trusting your interpretation over the experts who are actually saying/doing things.
21813,It's flat earth mentality.
21814,You only want to believe in what you can see and you ignore the reality that you don't get to see everything.
21815,Because you've never been to space you dont believe the earth is a globe since you've never seen it for yourself and your interpretation of what you do see points you to the conclusion that the world is flat because you don't have enough knowledge and expertise to understand how to properly interpret what you see.

21820,"I've survived *way* deadlier viruses than Covid-19, so it's not like the 2% death rate from covid scares me."
21821,"I wear a mask and and social distance, but people find it shocking that I'm overall unconcerned with potentially catching the virus."
21822,Same...unless of course somebody brings up the subject of tinitus.
21823,"Losing your sense of smell means it went into your brain, we are seeing brain bleeds and other additional rare events many months later from COVID infected at advanced rate vs control groups."
21824,"And those controls are those who had a pneumonia or flu instead of COVID (so we compare people who got sick, just from another similar virus/respiratory infection)."

21866,The point is that you are choosing between taking the risk to wait a little longer to get a bette vaccine (and get COVID while waiting) or injecting yourself with a half baked vaccine that can kill you.
21867,"If you factor in the probability to get COVID against the probability to get a stroke from AstraZeneca, it’s more rational from a purely egoistic stand point to convince others to take AstraZeneca to increase the herd immunity around you and wait for another vaccine to be available."

21875,"I have absolutely zero knowledge on the subject, but a little over a year of development only resulting in blood clots and minor side affects (at least as far as we know) is pretty good so far, right?"

21891,"But I suffer from allergies and have nasal congestion or runny nose on many days, which I guess makes it a teeensy chance that it could be early COVID on any given day."

21896,Feeling body aches today after taking the second dose of the vaccine yesterday.
21897,How long will this last?
21898,Tested infections are 1/10 so we think it’s probably 2/10 or even 3/10 who had it.
21899,"Odds you will catch without a vaccine are tough to estimate as you can try to rely on OTHERS getting vaccinated, but that’s an individual calculation that obviously we can’t do this as a group, or that doesn’t work anymore."
21900,"That said, this is just one side effect, so that favors the vaccine, since clots aren’t the only issue."
21901,"Conversely in favor a pause or restriction on an age of women, we should care the odds of it occurring in women under 50, not everyone."
21902,If it’s true that’s the subset with the deaths from vaccine clots.
21903,"They may be only 20% of the vaccine population so in that case the odds are 5x the “overall” rate, and for everyone else it’s not a big risk to worry about."
21904,It didn't
21905,Except theres not an infinite supply of all of the vaccines and even if there was the mRNA vaccines have far stricter storage requirements.
21906,On an individual scale its not an issue but on a mass scale suddenly getting rid of a huge amount of your vaccines is going to cause delays which in turn mean *more deaths than would have happened from these treatable clots*.
21907,Its not just the matter of sourcing more of the vaccines (which will make it harder for other countries too) you have to be sure that your vaccination centres that are currently set up for AZ or J&amp;J have the right equipment for storing these vaccines.
21908,"Oops now your vaccine programme is going to take 6 months longer, more people are going to die from the second order effects of prolonged lockdowns and straight up covid and you had to spend 10 times as much on the actual doses (Pfizer recently bumped the price up of their shot to 20 euros just to line their greedy scumbag pockets)  on top of additional infrastructure costs."

21931,Except real world data for Pfizer is in 100 million
21932,"Approximately two weeks after your first shot with the Pfizer/Moderna vaccines, it will be 80% efficaceous."
21933,"Meaning that compared to an unvaccinated person living in the same community behaving the same way as you, you'll be 80% less likely to get COVID."
21934,"Approximately 1-2 weeks after your second dose, the vaccine will give you the maximum protection, up to 95% efficacy."
21935,But that's only true if you actually got the second shot.
21936,"While it's clear that just a single shot already gives you some protection, it seems likely that protection will not be as good and probably also decays faster compared to being fully vaccinated."
21937,"The thing I see there is that as a pro vaccine I am willing (or capable) to analyze available information in scientific journals to decide for myself, and so far, the evidence points in the direction that vaccine outweighs any risk associated with the virus."
21938,"However, on the other side of the spectrum you have people that ignore such evidence and rather, choose to believe in fairy tales and unicorns."
21939,"&gt; Depends on how much longer COVID continues to be prevalent in the community, what kind of precautions an individual is taking against it, what local case rates are in one's specific community, etc."
21940,"Sure, but it's pretty obvious that one's personal precautions are, at this point, basically how good you are at dodging bullets."
21941,Covid wil continue to be prevalent in most countries until the population is mostly vaccinated - you can tell because most people have done fuck-all-nothing to prevent it from spreading.
21942,10% of the US has already got it despite this being one of the best advertised pandemics *ever* with one of the most scientifically-driven responses *ever.
21943,*
21944,"It's an American website, so naturally that's the country people are going to be discussing the most."
21945,Get over it.
21946,If you look across all of the UK they are averaging 33 deaths per day with a population of 66M.
21947,If you compare that to 2019 Flu deaths in the US (34200 / 365) and 328M population they have about 2x as many deaths right now vs average Flu deaths.
21948,So close to being done in the UK.
21949,It didn’t let me choose a time.
21950,It just said to choose what day I prefer.
21951,I chose next Tuesday
21952,Agreed.
21953,It's just as damaging to ignore procedures.
21954,"Also, we don't know if it really is a 1 in a million chance, that's why they are investigating it."
21955,Same!
21956,I spent a long time digging and never came up with much myself.
21957,I have to think based on the near identical efficacy results through 6 months between Moderna and Pfizer that it's either a detection issue (as you mentioned) or it really doesn't matter.
21958,I do find it interesting that even in animal trials they mentioned no CD8+ with Moderna.
21959,It seems they would have found that surprising and looked at alternate testing mechanisms if it was simply a detection issue but obviously I'm just speculating.

21969,"I would guess -- and would love to have it confirmed/denied -- that people with compromised (or even just mundanely unhealthy) immune systems aren't going to respond well to the vaccine, and thus will continue to be vulnerable to covid."

22004,K you guys lost your right to talk like that over the last 4 years.
22005,Simmer down and get back to rebuilding.
22006,I think the boosting nature of it is that you're simply elevating your baseline protection.
22007,"So you're definitely boosting, it's not like you're starting from scratch."
22008,But I'm with you it's very likely that by the time boosting becomes a thing there will be clear guidance on the best way to proceed.

22023,70% of Brazil is in shutdown.
22024,"The difference is that is is not decreed by Bolsonaro, but by governors."
22025,Floor-duh
22026,Oh well.
22027,In yet another metric the world is passing them by.
22028,Actually britain never ran into vaccine shortages because they over ordered and paid a little bit more than the eu.
22029,So AZ basically preferred to serve them first.
22030,The funding of the vaccine was a combined effort with britain having a big party of it but do not underestimate the eu funding oxford got and also the upfront cash az got to ramp up the factories.
22031,The Pfizer vaccine was mostly funded by German government money btw.
22032,I've been reading that it's going to take 3/4 months of the vaccine's circulation once it reaches around 50% vaccinated before we start seeing a significant drop in cases.
22033,Why?
22034,Because there's still a fuck-ton of people that can still get COVID.
22035,"That's been the government's stance on this the whole time: don't lift restrictions yet just because the vaccine is rolling out, because the dead-space in between people getting the vaccine and it actually offering protecting is vast and can be filled with lots and lots of cases."
22036,The masses don't make the decision to pause a vaccine
22037,... is there not that much space in Israel?
22038,"if I go outside in the US, I could walk for miles in any direction and not even be within 50 feet of anyone else, I don't know anyone that wears a mask outside."

22040,"They're not expensive, they really don't do anything to hinder your breathing, and they have been proven beyond any doubt whatsoever to reduce transmission and viral load."
22041,Just keep wearing the damn things a few more weeks instead of stretching out this disaster a few more weeks.

22046,Is it worth it?
22047,Do we know that the people who have had the vaccine and subsequent blood clots didn’t previously have covid?
22048,"Yeah, I have a few antivaxx relatives but everyone I care about in my own sphere (parents grandparents inlaws) are all vaccinated."
22049,"If the ""crazy part"" of the family chooses not to get it, the consequences are on them."
22050,Absolutely.
22051,It also helps with allergies at my work.
22052,I regularly wore surgical masks while doing some tasks before the pandemic and now I'll probably just stock up on kn95/kf94/n95 masks as the price plummets.
22053,It's been amazing not getting sick for a year and my sense of smell has improved.
22054,"Like how herd immunity killed off measles, chicken pox, thrush, polio?"
22055,"""Completely useless"" is rather hyperbolic."
22056,It can still be useful even if the compared groups are not equivalent.
22057,If the two groups have to be completely equivalent then even the comparison of the two cohorts in the study is useless since you can't have two completely equivalent groups unless they consist of the exact same individuals.
22058,"We don't except the rates to be different by several orders of magnitude in the general population, so it is good enough for a rough estimate of the rate."
22059,Doesn't this mean that by that logic you're more likely to get a blood clot if you were infected with covid which would be an eventuality?

22062,Do they ever mention the number of deaths in the US from COVID that are still occurring on a daily basis?
22063,Or the post infection risks?
22064,Or do they only promote anti-vaccine conspiracies?
22065,"&gt; New Hampshire is the only state that has more than half of its total population vaccinated with at least one dose

Connecticut had 52% with at least one dose as of Monday."
22066,This information is for idiots that don't want the vaccine.
22067,"I agree with you, but idiots will see your comment and be like ""fuck that now I'm not getting the vaccine cuz this study is lying"""
22068,"In a world where vaccine supply is so limited, it would be detrimental to humanity to conduct/publish a randomized study comparing the various vaccines at the current moment in time."
22069,"It'd be like studying which tastes better, long grain rice or basmati while the world suffers in a huge famine."
22070,"&gt; Im not a conspiracy theorist, but i have a hard time believing the idea there’s absolutely no way to compare 2 vaccines with the data we have

Whelp."
22071,"You're partially right, but mostly wrong."
22072,Can you compare them?
22073,"Sure, you can compare anything."
22074,"You can have them inject each into different arms and decide which shot felt best, but it's terrible science."
22075,Is it randomized.
22076,Is it controlled?
22077,Are the results statistically significant?
22078,Can the results be duplicated?
22079,"15-20% is not ""significant""."
22080,Not necessarily.
22081,Keep in mind that many people who've had Covid get a strong reaction to the first dose but not to the second one.
22082,People get shamed and called anti-vax just for choosing to take the Pfizer vaccine instead of the J&amp;J.
22083,Pregnant women are getting shamed for not getting even though the CDC website says that they don't know all the effects and to use your personal judgment after talking with your doctor.
22084,The pro-vax cult has gone fucking crazy.
22085,"It's not that we shouldn't track 2nd shot numbers, it's that the one you should put in a newspaper headline is 1st shots."
22086,"Honestly, an area could be opening up on the basis of first shots + 2 weeks, not second shots, given that that's where the bulk of protection comes online."
22087,"Also, second shots is basically just a snapshot of where first shots were a month ago, since almost everyone will go get them on time."
22088,But sex with farm animals still as popular as ever.

""The estimated risk of infection from touching a contaminated surface was low (less than 5 in 10,000), suggesting fomites play a minimal role in SARS-CoV-2 community transmission."""
22091,"Not zero risk, but close enough."
22092,"You probably should still disinfect high touch shared surfaces if someone in your home just tested positive, but other than that I would not worry about surface risks."
22093,"As a white rural conservative, I am fully vaccinated, and I am trying to convince my conservative friends and family to get vaccinated, sure I don't have the same values as a lot of people here, but I do believe in science, the vaccine was tested on 30k+ people, and it was proven safe, and has now been given 200 million times in the US."
22094,"I do feel like if you want to get more of us vaccinated though, you have to change the massaging, just saying the vaccine prevents death isn't going to work for that much longer as the most at risk are vaccinated, you have to offer a return to normal life as being linked with getting vaccinated, ie; no masks after a certain percentage, no restrictions for businesses, no online schooling, etc."
22095,Funny how you assume only Republicans are complaining about lockdowns.
22096,I voted blue and am tired of the lockdowns.
22097,The only people who care for my mental health are the people i pay to care.
22098,"Ive worn masks, i was able to get my first shot, im really done with it."
22099,Ending the lockdown is no longer a republican issue.
22100,Ikr I need it..
22101,"Ok, well, whatever."
22102,I was saying it's possible also.
22103,I'm with you with sites like Facebook being the worst offenders due to the AI and targeted content.
22104,However it's important to note that sites like Reddit (or any social media) still are a place for echo chambers.
22105,"When all you see/hear/feel is only what you want to see/hear/feel, it greatly promotes polarity and inability to compromise."
22106,In general the ability to lock yourself into an echo chamber safe space with ease as it has been over the last decade or more has been pretty devastating to our society is a whole.
22107,Just my opinion.
22108,I've noticed some public universities in the US get around this by requiring on-campus students and workers to take weekly COVID tests to keep access to nonresidential buildings.
22109,"The University of Michigan keeps locking out hundreds of students who don't follow the rule, it's kinda sad that these students don't take it seriously."
22110,Preprint articles require a higher degree of scrutiny and rigor to accurately evaluate than many other types of articles.
22111,This kind of discussion would be more appropriate for a more strictly scientific subreddit such as /r/COVID19.

22124,My mother has allergies to some of the components of vaccines and is unable to.

22126,"The clots seem to appear less in old people, for whom the risk of COVID is greater."
22127,"My parents are already vaccinated, but I would chew glass to get them the J&amp;J or AZ vaccine if that would get it to them."
22128,I have a question .
22129,"My parents got the first AstraZeneca dose 6 weeks ago  , and due to government incompetence in our country they might not be able to get the second one ..... however , they did get offered pfizer ... what’s the move here ?"
22130,Take two doses of pfizer or stay with one of Astra ?
22131,Any help would be greatly appreciated
22132,There is context lacking.
22133,Have those hospitalizations happened after two weeks post second dose?
22134,Because if you got infected between dose 1 and 2 then that’s a different story.

22263,"I feel like France watched the US response and said: ""Hold my wine"""
22264,How is it high risk if I have a vaccine that is 100% effective against severe illness and hospitalizations?
22265,You’re just gonna stay holed up until the virus magically goes away?
22266,"I got bad news man, it is most likely here to stay."
22267,I was all for playing it safe the last year but to say we can’t have our normal lives back after being vaccinated is utterly insane.
22268,It's like US presidential elections.
22269,Which way would you prefer to be fucked
22270,"To add on to this, the first Pfizer shots were administered December 14, so even the very first vaccinated person wasn't considered fully vaccinated till January 18."
22271,"It's much more likely, as you said, that he wasn't fully vaccinated when he was infected."
22272,"If he was operating out of his own office or a small medical office, he might have even just had his first shot and didn't get to receive the second."
22273,"lol, and you were worried so much about that too, weren't you?"
22274,Exactly.
22275,"I’m a low risk person in a low risk area, why would I choose the AZ vaccine with an added risk over the “safer” vaccines."
22276,"I understand the odds of a blood clot are minuscule and I’ll take it if it’s my only option, but rushing for the AZ vaccine isn’t something I necessarily *want* to do."
22277,"Yeah, this is half way just a formality as unofficially the mandate hasn't been enforced by the police for some weeks and many people stopped following it."
22278,"But the symbolism, that cautious Israel, which never had public opinion against masks is lifting it."
22279,"Don't worry about Bills fans, the vast amount of alcohol we consume pre-game should be enough to protect everybody inside the stadium."
22280,I'm in group 3 (for medical reasons) and got an invite to book an appointment yesterday.
22281,Group 3 is also 60-70 years of age.
22282,I think we will be done with over 60 year-olds in less than a month from now.
22283,As long as the feds keep using their straight distribution the average is going to slowly go down.
22284,Several states have a higher supply than demand and the vaccines just pile up there.
22285,Not to mention the J&amp;J pause will cause a 5-10% hit.
22286,I must call bullshit then
22287,"I think larger initial doses of virus have been linked to more severe covid, so probably?"
22288,The analogy I use is it's like an invasion.
22289,"Throw enough virus at the beachhead, and they'll probably take it."
22290,"But the vaccine up the value of ""enough"" by quite a lot."
22291,Ok gotcha.
22292,"I am not sure why people are down voting this, I was honestly asking."
22293,My hospital is saying that if you are symptomatic and it's been 3 months since your 2nd vaccine you should be tested.
22294,So it's a legitimate question.

22297,Risk of death per car trip is very roughly 1 in 5 million.
22298,"Obviously varies depending on distance (and other factors, such as age and risk profile of driver, time of day, etc)."
