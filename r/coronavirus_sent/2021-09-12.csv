9,People in other countries queue for hours to get the vaccine IF they even get it while in Texas airports the vaccine stands are totally empty.

16,I've been watching the rates for months now.
17,There's always been a large gap between first and second dose percentages and it hasn't been closing much.
18,It's probably largely people who already recovered from covid and believe they only need one dose.
19,"I disagree with that decision, but I think that's what the data is showing."
20,"If she's on remicade, it may actually help her."
21,They are studying remicade right now to see if it can be used for patients with severe covid-19.
22,Also haven't heard of anyone on remicade dying because they were on remicade and got covid19.

31,"Flight from FL, of course."
32,Thanks for the heads-up.
33,I will pay attention.
34,So youre thought is that you've got some variante going on there which is more dangerous to the kids which we don't yet have here.
35,Very scary.
36,"You give up because of one month, 19 months into the pandemic?"

54,Thanks for the well wishes!
55,I wish I would get better.
56,It's been over 2 years now of pain and discomfort and I have no idea where to go from here.
57,My doctors get annoyed when they hear what insurance I have though since they deny everything.
58,I'm leaning against costochondritis myself because of the specific symptoms and popping feelings I've felt in certain positions.
59,I had a second doctor rule it out for the time being since they literally checked nothing else beforehand and the main symptoms weren't lining up.
60,"It's still possible though, but the fact that the one doctor that was subbing for my normal doctor that day came in, told me I had it and that there is nothing they can do besides maybe give pain killers, which I turned down because I don't want anything like that, kind of left me pissed off since besides an x-ray where they saw nothing, they only did an ultrasound of my organs."

76,Dangerous misleading and clickbait headline.
77,The mRNA delivers the instructions and then your body starts producing them hence it gives you the spike protein.
78,With the vector vaccine instead of mRNA it's a modified harmless coronavirus strain that delivers the spike protein instructions.

213,There is a rising discussion in Austria and Germany if the test should remain free.
214,Since you have to be vaccinated or tested to eat in restaurants and testing is quick and free many didn’t get vaccinated.
215,"The government pays around 25€ per test done to the pharmacy (AG Test/ Rapid Test)

In Vienna the PCR Test is free as well, is done via Video/WebApp and the city pays around 15€ per test."

243,"My kid weighs 10lbs less than me.... and yes, is a kid.....but I'm not going to lie, I feel a little concerned (not in regards to death, but regarding infection and what comes with that) and I'd like my kid to have a vaccine dose that's at *least* half of mine rather than a 10th.....we basically wear the same size clothes so *shrugs shoulders and throws hands up* 
Idk maybe I think that means something but perhaps it doesn't....."

261,Yes but 5x of that 10x (11x for death) is due to a smaller chance of catching it in the first place.
262,"The guy i replied to was responding to someone who was vaccinated but got Covid anyway, so when you take the 5x away you are left with 2x reduction (2.2x for death)."
263,"And he said:

&gt;But if you do get infected, vaccines dramatically reduce the symptoms and likelihood of being hospitalized."
264,"But if you do end up hospitalized, vaccines dramatically reduce the likelihood of dying."

317,"Fortunately people driving by all seemed to be flipping them off or ignoring them (I saw one facepalm) but I can't say the same for other parts of the country, or even state."
318,Infection can work.
319,Just it is not as predictible as vaccinations.
320,Everyone just assumed they had the best infection for immunity ever.
321,"From what I've heard, they're talking about 6 months from now in case immunity from the third dose wanes."
322,Maybe we should tell them that this test was developed using fetal stem cells.
323,The unvaccinated believers needed to get a pre delta strain last year to match their claims.
324,Aka the first weak infection to them will give natural immunity to all new strains unlike a vaccine.
325,So they should have caught it last year pre new variants.

339,I don't know if it's a loud minority because we have a majority vaccinated.

358,"&gt; Lamda is/was trumped by delta

[No](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/coronavirus/article253576914.html)"
359,It works!
360,Thanks you so much!
361,good point.
362,do you think UBI for until this disease is gone or controlled better would work?
363,I have 2 kids under 12 and I'm getting them vaccinated ASAP.
364,"You are citing this article, why do you think it is good data?"
365,Why do you think the authors are correct in what they are proposing?
366,Are there any issues with their research methodology?
367,"""Slippery slope"" is a logical fallacy."
368,Try to argue your point rationally.
369,"I fell the same way bud, I have zero problem wearing a mask on the plane or anywhere indoors, but I'm vaccinated, I was probably exposed to Delta at this point if I didn't have it months ago, I'm protected as possibly can be, I want to live my life."
370,Well they have 5 kids.
371,5.
372,That to me is an amount of religious knuckleheadism.
373,People with that amount of children are.
374,"I know, I come from 6 kids."
375,"People who couldn't support them properly, or feed them properly or clothe them properly or pay for any education for them."
376,Most of us left home as soon as legally possible.
377,My sister's joined the army which was easier than living with them.
378,"At least 60 years ago, my parents had an excuse, but they would  probably do the same now, because Catholic."
379,"Similar procedure is now being employed in Turkey, it is obviously going to be shitshow."
380,So far only 5 days in and 200 classrooms (if government is telling the truth) had to be quarantined for 14 days.
381,They are apparently adamant about not closing the schools and say that school is the safest place etc.
382,"Considering that kids are not vaccinated, are in crowded classrooms and mask mandate is not really followed (if it is followed, listening and teaching 40 min classes with a mask does not really help with comprehension) it is obviously not a great choice to open the schools with 23000 new cases &amp; 250+ deaths a day."
383,The disruption to education for in-person education is much much greater than online education.
384,Studies also show that infection alone provides better protection than vaccination alone against delta.
385,I think the recent one said it was to the tune of 6x.
386,"if you have had covid it it's still a good idea to get vaccinated, but being unvaccinated with natural immunity is not nearly as risky as just walking around completely covid-naive."
387,&gt; I’ve read several articles saying that you can’t exercise or drink alcohol several days before Pfizer shot.
388,I also read articles that say the opposite.
389,Complete clickbait garbage.
390,Ignore them all.

392,"&gt; Israel is making preparations to ensure it has sufficient vaccine supply in case a fourth round of Covid-19 shots is needed, the country’s top health official said on Sunday."
393,Just negotiating supply options at this point.
394,"My guess would be 4th doses would be recommended only for severely immunocompromised people at first, if at all."
395,"We still don't know much about the duration of 2-dose immunity at this point, let alone 3-dose..."
396,Articles like this really seem to be pushing forth this impossible goal of covid eradication which is not going to happen full stop.
397,Its literally impossible at this point.
398,"Legitimately, because of my medication, though I'm not nearly as immunocompromised as some others are."
399,I had it done through a health network vaccine clinic.
400,"When I arrived at the clinic and registered I was asked what my reason was for the third dose, and before I received the injection, I was asked again."
401,"Both times I was asked, it seemed more that it was for documenting purposes, rather than policing things, though I'm not sure - because it was affiliated with my health network, I don't know if they had access to see my list of diagnoses and medications."
402,There was another woman there for her third dose who told me that she has diabetes and she's getting it even though that's not on the list of reasons.
403,She seemed to get her dose with no issue.
404,"(In reading this over before submitting, I just realized you didn't ask about my experience with symptoms, but here it is anyway, in case you or anyone else is interested)."
405,I got 3rd dose Moderna.
406,My first dose I had a sore arm and that was pretty much it.
407,"My second dose I had a sore arm, fatigue, and one night had a night sweat."
408,"This third dose, so far I've had pain in my arm (which improved around 2nd day, as it did before), fatigue (which improved after the 2nd day - same as before) and some mild body aches, no night sweat yet (I think it came on ~3rd day previously), but this time I do have ""COVID arm"" which is a delayed hypersensitivity reaction that seems to be associated with the Moderna vaccine."
409,I didn't have it the first two times.
410,"This time there is a red, circular rash, that is warm to the touch, a bit tender and swollen around the area of the injection (it actually seems to be just below the site of injection)."
411,Don't bring their parents politics in to how orphans should be treated.

464,"Yes, it's possible that they had Covid but it's also possible they just got sick and had a false positive PCR test."

466,Like you say better story this way.

474,No one can govern a truth that isn’t known.
475,Yep!
476,It is a really tough choice to make and for the moment my doctors have advised against it but that can always change with further research!
477,"With a mix of vaccine immunity and natural immunity covid simply stops being a risk to the vast majority of people, and potentially we even reach herd immunity"
478,"Way too many nurses are anti vax, it’s shocking."
479,Yes.

483,Each antivaxxer is the product of billions spent on libertarian lobbying and propaganda to underfund education and erode faith in government.
484,The problem is there are still children that aren’t vaccinated.
485,Once my kids have the shot I will be much less worried.
486,I wasn’t very worried before DELTA.
487,3 months seems like that 90 day wait period you are supposed to havr between getting covid and getting vaxxed
488,Same.
489,"There is a mask mandate still where I live, and I wear a mask indoors."

497,Did you get vaccinated?
498,But the college students are not the entire community.
499,The fac/staff go home to their unvaccinated children or other vulnerable family members.
500,Actually society is cracking down on people knowingly giving sexually transmitted diseases.
501,It is seen as grevious bodily harm and can have a 5 year prison sentence.
502,"That's for a virus which is very slow to cause harm, with immediate preventative interventions, a good life expectancy and also doesn't spread further unless you have unprotected sex."
503,Maybe we should also remove restrictions for drink driving?
504,I still don't think we'd have as many daily deaths as we do now with covid or the NHS being overrun.
505,Anyway we'll have to see how this pans out.
506,Boardwasters saw around 5000 cases after an outdoor event with an above national death spike in the area to follow.
507,"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51768274

Death and harm of others has been accepted by the healthy who can brush off Covid (or think they can)."
508,The civil liberties of the vulnerable to go to these events is non existent and they have to continue to hide away from normal life.
509,Absolutely.
510,So having an outdoor crowd at the stadium could even be reducing cases.
511,This could easily have been the case all last season as well (for outdoor sports).
512,"Though sports bars weren't packed then, but people were surely having house parties to replace them."
513,That’s close enough for me.
514,"Honestly I got my son done in May, and his birthday is January 2010."
515,He’s also not a small kid so I had zero concerns with this.
516,Hospitals are not close to being overwhelmed in Israel.
517,"the unvaccinated get sick and some die, also some vaccinated get hospitalized and some die, but with much lower risk."
518,It seems we can live with that indefinely.

520,So so so sad!
521,Why did this have to happen?
522,It’s horrible
523,That's a tough call
524,"If they're more than 6 months past the third dose, and over 50, a booster shot is a much cheaper answer than changing your life around COVID."
525,"As it is, their risk (of catching COVID from your kids) is higher than your kids risk of catching it from them."
526,2 and up by November?
527,Wow.
528,Got a source.
529,I’m sorry you feel this way.
530,I agree that everybody who can be vaccinated should be but in the States we have a huge shortage of medical professionals including the low paid folks who clean the rooms and prepare foods.
531,"We already are seeing hospitals unable to function and a mass exodus of staff nurses to contract positions, of which I’m not even sure are require to vaccinated - Travel nurses let me know."
532,My hope is these folks will get vaccinated.
533,My wife’s OB in January or February gave her a medical journal published and reviewed by the ACOG that said they were recommending pregnant women in at least their second trimester get the shot.
534,They used data based on all other mRNA vaxxes.
535,My wife got it in March at 7 months pregnant.
536,You literally already get vaccines while in the last trimester of pregnant to improve antibody transfer to the baby.
537,The covid vaccine is no different
538,Oh they definitely are.

572,"And by the end of this month, at least by Worldometers' count, Covid will have killed at least 700 thousand Americans."
573,"That is an absolutely staggering loss of lives, yet millions don't seem to care at all unless and until they catch it and they're the ones who realize they might actually get killed, and by then it's too late."
574,"Of course, even for those who don't die, a huge number will be crippled in ways we don't even fully understand yet."
575,"Most shockingly, there is a magic potion (more than one, actually) that basically stops the worst of all this from happening, and it has been widely available, for months, for free... but millions turn it down, and put their lives on the line, just to make a point."

586,Might be worth contacting them.
587,"Unpopular opinion, but I would never send a known immocompromised child to public school."
588,"For reference, we are not sending our healthy children into the public school system."
589,"As I said, everyone gets to make their own choices."
590,It's such a silly argument when anyone can get sick from simply grabbing milk at the grocery store.
591,How many times is this story gonna be posted here?
592,"Those numbers will eventually go up, whether it be out of fear or attrition."
593,I have been saying this to my husband only half joking (and of course I’m generalizing): nurses are a major problem in spreading misinformation and fomenting vaccine hesitancy.
594,"Glad of their help in 2020, but in 2021 they need to leave the science to the scientists."
595,Starting to hate nurses and their bizarre country-wide power tripping.
596,THIS IS WHAT SCARES ME.
597,And if I hear one more person say it’s not any more serious than the fucking flu.
598,One more person….
599,Every-time I hear that I ramble on about long COVID at them.
600,"People are not only refusing to face reality, they are responding in incredibly stupid ways and aggressively so."
601,Like we need to face fucking reality so we can take the best action given what’s actually happening.
602,I have to agree when you also realize that at some point everyone is ganna get covid.
603,It's not going away and we need to live our lives.
604,"Oh, that's better than a year, but they're so fragile those first few weeks."
605,"It's been 8+ years since I was pregnant last, so I couldn't remember the specifics."

607,It's not hard.
608,You ask your doctor.
609,"You can literally call them at 9pm and you'll get a call, text, video chat, it's easier than ever."
610,Most doctors *should* advise getting vaccinated.
611,I hope California makes the correct decision in the recall election.
612,"Our political leaders must take COVID seriously, and our people must be willing to comply with common sense public safety guidelines."
613,"If not, many more tragedies like this will follow."
614,"&gt; Definitely safer than watching in a sports bar

Don’t worry those are packed too lol."
615,The whole county is “packed” once again.
616,"&gt; 0.000015% of children die from covid

Lie."
617,"&gt; this is because 0.0074% of people who had vaccine had complications including death 

Probably not a lie if by ""complications including death"" you mean ""complications including, but almost never, death""."
618,There's simply no way we'll be able to continue this soft lockdown (of sorts) indefinitely.
619,People are social animals.
620,Family and friends will be seeing each other.
621,Events will continue to occur.
622,"People are going to gather, period, regardless of vaccinations."
623,Mask mandates and continuing to get shots in arms is the only things that we can do about this.

640,Ironically their CFR is being driven down by the same factor that is driving their cases up: almost nobody under 18 is recommended to get vaccinated.
641,"CFR in over-50s is still 2% for vaccinated, 6% for unvaccinated, but the number of cases in that group is so minuscule now compared to the under-18s that the overall CFR is 0.2%."

684,I posted an ArsTechnica link summarizing the 3 recent studies and linking to their sources which the AutoMod removed because apparently it's not a reputable site.
685,"I DM'ed op the direct CDC link to the study, explaining why his post was inaccurate."
686,He is acting like a knob and hamming up the automod action here for more than it really is.
687,If you're curious this is the CDC study from 2 days ago which talks about the reduction of hospitalization/deaths from being vaccinated and it not as dramatic as the OP thinks it is.
688,https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7037e1.htm?s_cid=mm7037e1_w
689,Not necessarily.
690,When a virus mutates it uses a host cells to replicate itself.
691,The host has to have multiple viruses at a time and the virus “miss packages” itself into something slightly different.
692,This Covid virus can use humans and a whole host of mammals to mutate itself.
693,"We know for sure that Mink, Cats and several others can then pass it back to humans."
694,Some of those virus mutations might be less dangerous and less contagious.
695,Others might be way more contagious and dangerous.
696,"The problem is, the less dangerous ones won’t keep going."
697,"If it’s not as easy to catch them, then it won’t keep traveling to other people."
698,That’s what we’re seeing right now.
699,If you look at all the variants we have dozens that are known.
700,The ones that make it more contagious are the ones that people will catch and pass on.
701,"Then that more dangerous one can be repackaged into an even more dangerous one, etc."
702,That’s why each wave has been worse than the one before.
703,The more contagious strains keep spreading to larger percentages of the population.
704,It's (mostly) outdoors though.
705,This is the kind of thing that could (mostly) be done safely the entire pandemic.
706,Definitely safer than watching in a sports bar.
707,Unfortunately the USA healthcare insurances are run like car insurance.
708,"The more you cost the system, the more expensive you are to insure and your premiums go up."
709,We do have the plus factor of most if not all insurances charge nothing for preventative care.

723,"The odds of this happening to an under 40 year old couple is pretty insane, and this isn't the first time I've heard of a couple both dying, makes me think theres something about how you catch covid that can increase fatality rate , like if you get infected by a covid carrier at just the right time at peak load , its much worse for you or maybe its something about the variant these 2 caught ."

793,The vector vaccines carry instructions as well it's just that it's delivered by a vector instead of mRNA.
794,Saying the vector vaccines have the spike and the mRNA don't is wrong.
795,They both carry instructions it's the delivery method that's different which is what I already said in a previous comment and I'm repeating myself now.
796,"They all have the instructions and they make you produce the spike so they either both have the spike or they ""don't"" have it."

847,"So, my country rolled out mass vax in july and of course many got themselves the jab."
848,But some were only to get it because they wont get govt incentive if they dont get vaccinated.

960,So over the weekend I had a lot of discussions and would like to strengthen my arguments.
961,So I have a question.
962,"Most people who aren't vaccinated yet didn't do so simply because of ""I don't know the long term side effects""."
963,"&amp;#x200B;

Now I always read arguments like: 

* Usually, long term side effects imply long term exposure."
964,E.g.
965,you need to take some medication for 10 years but that medication takes it's toll on some organ =&gt; You die because the medication fucked up your organ.
966,Or whatever.
967,* We know vaccines very good.
968,There was never a vaccine with a long term issue.
969,All issues showed in 3 weeks at max.
970,We are way past that.
971,"Now while those seem to make sense, people usually counter the first one with: How do you know that's the case for a absolutely new technology like mRNA vaccines?"
972,"Who says that I won't get some issue 2, 5 or 20 years from now?"
973,"and the second one with: All previous vaccines were based on different technologies, e.g."
974,"protein based or ""dead virus"" based."
975,Not mRNA based.
976,"&amp;#x200B;

A lot of those people wait for protein based vaccines (e.g."
977,"novavax) because then, those two points become valid again."
978,"&amp;#x200B;

1001,*
1002,Claiming that vaccines are a govt conspiracy?
1003,Yeah some things were incorrect.
1004,Capitalism may be the death of us but it also made the vaccine.
1005,No way around that.
1006,Hoarding is not the right word either.
1007,It’s not like there are enough doses for the whole world in a fridge in Pfizer’s basement.
1008,They are pumping them out as fast as possible and they are being distributed.
1009,"I'm still depressed af, so I don't know if I totally agree with this."
1010,It can be both.
1011,And now all this current ping ponging is going to put them even more behind than if schools had stayed virtual and focused on improving the system.
1012,Viruses are not bacteria
1013,Another argument is that they very likely have already had other vaccines that all may also have long term side effects.
1014,"However overall they, and everyone, are healthier because of the vaccinations."
1015,It's clear that many people have not really thought very hard about vaccinations until now even though many of them got them as kids or have taken their kids to get them.
1016,They did it then so why not do it now?
1017,"Didn't say that they where irreversible did I, just that there going down and not surging as he said."
1018,μ
1019,"The whole ""teachers aren't working"" thing is such boomer crap."
1020,"As if to imply that people who work from home are less productive, which there is absolutely zero evidence of, and for many of us the total opposite is true."
1021,It's amazing how much an improved work-life balance can enhance productivity regardless of where one is working from.
1022,"Clearly he hasn’t seen the definite irreversible downward trend since, let’s see, 5 days ago."
1023,"Not entirely sure how deserved it is to call out EU, considering that for most of the pandemic they single handedly carried the entire western vaccine exports by sharing more than they kept for themselves"

1030,"They had/have time to get the shot, no excuses anymore."
1031,"The monk overcoming the freezing cold thing is real, the original is known as Tummo, but Wim Hof developed a different method that's far better for cold."
1032,It's wild.
1033,Also we have footage now from a fighter jet and pilot testimony of a craft that may have come out of the water and performed feats of technical sophistication in ways that our current understanding of physics is barely capable of imagining let alone replicating.
1034,[deleted]
1035,"I agreed with your ways at the beginning, but at this point now it doesn't matter to me anymore."
1036,Fuck all of them for prolonging things based on ignorance and believing Russian trolls on Facebook instead of actual experts.
1037,The mind boggling things I continue to see and read is ridiculous and there is no reaching them.
1038,Fuck em all.
1039,Immune compromised and elderly can still be vulnerable to serious infection and death even after vaccination.
1040,Some children are also more vulnerable to covid but still can’t get vaccinated—you saying we should just let all these people die is disturbing.
1041,They want to be seen as martyrs.
1042,What happened when you asked the flight attendant to change your seat?

1044,I’m with you also from KY. My household is fully vaxxed.

1046,The schools have tons of cases people still refuse to get vaxxed and wear masks.
1047,It’s so frustrating.
1048,Thank goodness for Beshear  or we would be in even worse shape.
1049,That's a low estimate.
1050,"I haven't bought glasses from anywhere in person in about 8 years, and back then my estimate was to be around $500."
1051,I don't have complicated vision issues.
1052,"Look, I'm vaccinated, my kid that is old enough is vaccinated, almost everyone close to me is vaccinated, and my town is &gt;90% vaccinated."
1053,"I'm an advocate for vaccines, and I'm a scientist for a pharma company who has devoted all my professional energy to advancing medicines."
1054,"I don't think the insults are helpful (and in general, I don't think name-calling and insult is right)."
1055,How do we reach more communities of color with low % vaccinated?
1056,"How do we reach ""red areas""?"
1057,What will produce the best results?
1058,"These are important questions for the health of the world, and more selfishly the health of me and my loved ones."
1059,I'm fairly confident insults are not the answer.
1060,Johnson and Johnson recipient and got covid last month.
1061,Only symptom I had was a cough.

1097,"They haven’t been able to vaccinate enough people yet, which means a small country whose hospitals can easily be overwhelmed would be fucked if they were stupid and let the virus run rampant."
1098,They are trying to get it down to zero prior to vaccination getting to a certain level.
1099,"It's literally the stated aim despite your blathering, mate."
1100,"&gt;It’s true that it can still be passed around by vaccinated people, but the amount of severe illness and hospitalisations are far less when vaccinated and when the majority are."

1103,A place with all the vaccines necessary and more.

1106,"Somewhat balanced out by the fact that deaths have been minimal, but plenty have written about how the exit plan is extremely compromised by Delta potentially running through a population with near zero immunity the moment you open up even slightly, and even with strong vaccination coverage; see Singapore."

1156,&gt;US hoarded vaccines for a while.
1157,So did India.
1158,This isn't really a controversial statement to make.
1159,At the very least India were freely exporting vaccines until they experienced the worst outbreak in the world up until that point.
1160,The US started hoarding without having exported a single vaccine
1161,I thought this was a pun when I read the first two words.

I'm not sure I follow: are you saying that on average the work relationship between nurses and doctors is so bad that nurses simply mistrust doctors' judgement on health related issues?"

1239,I live in Western Australia and we have no community transmission and our economy and mental health are both doing great as a result.
1240,"You might think locking down an entire state because of a couple of cases is crazy but if you stamp it out with a hard fast lock down, it seems to have the best outcomes in all the metrics."
1241,As opposed to Sydney which tried to walk the line of seeing how far they could go without locking down and as a result now dealing with much more turmoil and restriction of freedoms.
1242,Much appreciated.
1243,"Yup

Just think the regular ""free"" tests here really probably are costing us 10x because we pay with tax money."
1244,"No real accountability there, especially during a pandemic."
1245,There are significantly more immunocompromised individuals in the vaccinated group in models 1 and 2.
1246,That would screw data wildly.
1247,I doubt this article will make it past peer review.
1248,Hopefully someone else can use the same dataset to compare natural vs vaccine immunity.
1249,I think proving it worked will be consistent across the board but maybe dosage and potential side effects could vary for children vs adults.

1343,CVS and Walgreens sell them for about $25.
1344,I was reading about schizophrenics recently.
1345,"They used to be generally isolated from each other, and would get treatment."

1355,What kind of logic is it to be pregnant and go somewhere crowded like a water park during a pandemic and you're not vaccinated?
1356,Wtf were they thinking?
1357,I'm avoiding all crowded places even though I'm vaccinated.
1358,I just don't think those places are safe at all during a pandemic.
1359,200K is NOTHING.
1360,I have 1 million in life insurance on my husband (he makes more than I do) and we only have 3 kids.
1361,My wife got vaccinated while pregnant in Feb with me (we signed up as soon as it became available).
1362,It was a tough decision.
1363,"Her primary care, ob, perinatal all had hopeful but cautious opinions, some seemingly contradictory."
1364,Things seemed to work out fine so we made the right choice.
1365,According to this article - the CDC didn't issue firm guidance until Aug 11th after she had been hospitalized.
1366,"If it's been known for a while, why did the CDC wait?"
1367,Who do we listen to?
1368,The CDC?
1369,The WHO?
1370,Our personal care physician?
1371,The attending nurses (which to our horror in the delivery ward were not all vaxxed? )

1375,Your sister in law?
1376,"75% of adults are vaccinated, that's just over 51% of the population."
1377,But a lot of the population is ineligible for a vaccination.
1378,The vast majority of those that are eligible got the jab.
1379,Have we reached herd immunity?
1380,How far do we have to go?
1381,Do we know?
1382,No we don't know.
1383,There's a lot that's not known.
1384,"It's as much a guessing game or a ""wait and see"" as it is science."
1385,Remember when it was impossible to have a vaccine as quickly as we did?
1386,Then we did.
1387,"Many of those that now say go get the jab, were cautioning against it not too long ago."
1388,The lack of empathy and sanctimony from the vaccinated towards those that are not is stunning.
1389,Sure some people are idiots that'll never get the vaxx no matter what.
1390,But that's not everyone that hasn't had the jab.
1391,I've got to the point I just really ignore it.

1399,He's at least publicly apologised for dining out.
1400,"People are complaining about his ""$300 dinner with three households"" but in all honesty that's nowhere close to terrible on the scale of things."
1401,"I went for the anti-reflective coating and really like it, and would probably throw down for trying some of the others next time (like the blue light filter)."
1402,But I stocked up on specs so I don't have to get my eyes checked for a good while haha.
1403,"Right, I agree, it is pretty bad."
1404,"I have worked with these types for a living, so I see it as a challenge, to try and get through to them."
1405,Or listen to them to understand where the roots of their thinking comes from.
1406,And it is all different.
1407,"Some are simply Trump loyalists, some are total followers and don't question anything, some are attracted to bizarre absurd explanations because it makes them feel special, some (many actually) are dreadfully uninformed and don't read or watch regular news, some have a lot of long-standing suspicion regarding mainstream medicine because of peer group culture of natural remedies etc., some are diehard Teaparty type Republicans and - I don't know, I have trouble understanding them."
1408,The whole antivax and antimask movement is so large and diverse.
1409,It really does shock me how many people have been pulled into this against all common sense.

1415,They are able to test for Covid by testing wastewater.
1416,"It helps determine ""clusters"" of positive cases."
1417,My son's college tested their wastewater to determine if one dorm had higher rates of Covid that other dorms.
1418,It is easy for the public to access .... no ... but there are people whose jobs are to collect wastewater and test it on a regular basis.
1419,"They test for all sorts of things; phosphorus, heavy metals, nitrates, bacteria, etc."

1421,I appreciate it man!
1422,"Tbh, I'm pretty free thinking in the first place, and it wasn't so much their fear mongering that kept me away from the shot, it was more of my high reaction rate to medicines and shots."
1423,"I actually broke out in hives for a good 20 minutes after the second shot, and got a lil worried, but it was temporary, and my Dr contributed it to my sensitivity to shots."

1440,Well that's disappointing.
1441,Of course...it's assuming the blue doesn't get out and vote...right?
1442,[removed]
1443,My kids are in the second round of Moderna trials now.
1444,"They are giving the same dose as the adults got in one group, half the adult dose in the other, placebo in the last."
1445,"Moderna’s adult dose is more than 3x Pfizer’s, at 100 micrograms vs. 30."
1446,"Moderna seems to believe 100 is the recommended dose for everyone, and once my kids are unblinded, if they were in the 50 micrograms group, they will offer to dose them up to the recommended dose of 100 micrograms."
1447,"So while Pfizer is doing a much lower dose for kids, that’s not necessarily true for all of the vax makers."
1448,Seriously!
1449,And I even have a blue light filters on my latest ones.
1450,The issue with nurses specifically though is that other people quote anti-vax nurses as an appeal to authority.
1451,How many posts start with “this nurse I know…” or “a nurse who works at the hospital…” and it makes me want to scream.

1479,"Just one note, covid caused the blood clot, not the medication."
1480,Never in my career have I seen such high D-Dimer (indicates clotting is currently happening somewhere in the body) levels on so many patients.
1481,"This is why for some people, their first indication that they have covid is that they have a heart attack."
1482,(Caused by clotting that cuts off circulation to the heart.)
1483,What…you think 3 kids is pushing it?
1484,"Read their applications to the FDA, look at the differences between their efficacy (their own data) and the efficacy of other non mRNA vaccines after 1 dose."
1485,J&amp;J 1 dose is a shitty equivalent to 1 dose of every other non mRNA vaccine.
1486,"It's generally safe though, which is what the FDA approval focuses on, not whether 1 dose is sufficient."
1487,It sounds like you need to take care of yourself now.

1495,I assume part of the FDA process was sorting this out through small scale studies of groups that consented to be part of an early trial.
1496,Gather as much data as possible to reduced risks of adverse risks for a dosage.
1497,Then rollout the shots for kids.

1501,"All I was saying was that you don’t have to be Uber religious to have 5 kids, it’s not that strange."
1502,Naive question: why don't antibodies created by vaccination cause the same response?
1503,Is it because most vaccines target the spike protein instead of Ace2?
1504,"Does that mean that attenuated virus vaccines could also cause ""long covid"" symptoms?"
1505,That's so true.
1506,They've built more housing but the average cost of a 1bdr apartment is $2150 CDN ($1700 USD) and for 2bdr is $2900 CDN ($2280 USD).

1550,"Yeah, no joke, back when Covid was first starting and the first lockdowns happened I was arguing with a bunch of the morons who kept saying it's just a flu."
1551,"Some lady came at me with a bunch of numbers trying to prove her point, but I realized she was just interpreting some bar graphs completely wrong, and I pointed out that her numbers had just proved my point actually."

1554,"Some stores require masks, but most recommend or just don't even mention masks, with employees often not wearing them."
1555,There's lots of indoor dining going on.
1556,"Things loosened considerably when case counts were low, and then tightened somewhat when the CDC declared us a high transmission county (which is a pretty low bar to reach), but haven't changed since then."
1557,I think the main drivers for that are: 1.
1558,"We're experiencing a properly flattened curve, as far as cases are concerned, and 2."
1559,Hospitals are still a long way from being strained.

1571,74% of eligible people doesn’t include anyone under twelve.
1572,So it isn’t “84% of people”.
1573,"Vaccination headlines use “percent of adults” and “percent of eligible population” and “percent of population.” 

Herd immunity numbers needs to be reached for the total population, not just those eligible for vaccination."
1574,And what percentage it takes to reach hers immunity for a disease changes  depending on how contagious it is (which has increased with Delta Covid) and how effective the vaccine is (which has decreased with Delta Covid).

1581,"And most of their output is going to the US, Canada and Europe while the third world gets scraps."
1582,Meanwhile there's huge vaccine production facilities all over that can't produce Covid vaccines because they don't have the licenses or the formulas.
1583,The only legal way to get licenses is convoluted and practically impossible.
1584,This isn't some theoretical problem.

1648,The way I understand it Delta is just way more contagious so even if you've had Covid or the vaccine you can still catch and spread Delta.

1662,The vaccines are very effective but not 100%.

1678,I think most virologists and immunologists have been saying exact that.
1679,"(There's a cardiologist on twitter who has different takes on this, but he's no virologist.)"
1680,"The reason we have so many breakthrough cases is the emergence of a new dominant variant, Delta, to which antibodies (for Wuhan-Hu1) have 8 times less  affinity."
1681,Your antibodies from the 3rd-dose might not stop infection from the next variant.
1682,"Guess what would be the best way to stop the ""next"" antibody-escaping variants: vaccinate the world."
1683,"It's a PANdemic, no one is safe until everyone is safe."

1728,"This study indicates fully vaccinated adults are almost 50% less likely to develop long covid symptoms: [Double vaccination halves risk of long covid, study finds](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/09/210901191407.htm)"
1729,I have a big problem with public perception being used as a reason to not support it in a scientific publication.
1730,That's neither data nor science.
1731,It's an assumption being made and ignoring that among adults that's unlikely to make a difference in the vaccine hesitant remaining.
1732,"It also may undermine future boosters for variants, something they even discuss as being potentially beneficial."
1733,The publication also carefully avoids discussing breakthroughs in general and only mentions severe disease.
1734,"Reducing breakthroughs is crucial while a large chunk of the population is ineligible for the vaccine and could be important for the next few months, as the youngest children aren't likely to be eligible until 2022."
1735,"We won't stop covid, but a reduction in spread could make a huge difference."
1736,"I wouldn't be surprised if Chinese authorities were trying to use this Singaporean man as proof that the virus came from outside, so basically the foreigners are to blame and China did everything it could."
1737,"Reality is, it's simply not possible that this man was positive upon his entry in China and tested negative for several times over 21 days before going out in the community and infecting others."
1738,It's just not how this virus works.
1739,"He definitely caught the virus in the community, or during quarantine."
1740,"We have been crushing it with the vaccines, it's over 80% of adults/eligible in most areas, and the moment it comes available for kids I'm sure there will be very strong uptake there too."
1741,My youngest is in high school and everyone they know who is eligible has had it.
1742,To show which words are used by people who use the language.
1743,"If someone calls you out saying X isn't a word or isn't the correct way to spell the word, then a dictionary is a good source to show it is."
1744,"&gt;The conclusion by scientists, including two senior Food and Drug Administration officials and the WHO, came as studies continue to show the authorized Covid vaccines in the U.S. **remain highly effective against severe disease and hospitalization caused by the fast-spreading delta variant."
1745,"**

&gt;While Covid vaccine **effectiveness against mild disease may wane over time**, protection against severe disease may persist, the scientists said."
1746,"That’s because the body’s immune system is complex, they said, and has other defenses besides antibodies that may protect someone from getting seriously sick."
1747,I guess the question really becomes: do we want to use booster shots to limit the effectiveness against mild disease or not?
1748,"I assume by effectiveness against mild disease, they mean actually catching covid."
1749,The main point of the vaccines was to protect against severe/death - it ended up being a bonus that they protected against catching covid too.
1750,But now that we have vaccines that DO protect against catching covid - I am of the opinion we should be boosting people to keep that protection going.
1751,Even more so in a country where 20-25% of people dont seem to give a fuck about protecting anyone.
1752,Lets get maximum protection in those that give a damn.
1753,&gt; Nothing stopped NZ or Australia from procuring vaccines.
1754,NZ at least has plenty of vaccines now.
1755,It's only a matter of getting jabs in arms as fast as people can queue up.
1756,"We have already gone above the peak daily rates of the US, UK and Canada."
1757,"A total of 76% of the eligible population has made their vaccine appointments, with 66% having had their first jab now."
1758,"In Auckland where the outbreak is numbers are even higher, with close to 3% of the population getting a jab each day in the last week."
1759,"The hope in NZ is to hold off on opening the border until kids can be jabbed, which would give us much higher vaccination rates than in Singapore right now."
1760,"There is also the possibility boosters in Q1 2022 will provide better protection, as Israel is experimenting with now."
1761,NZ has Novavax already lined up for boosters in early 2022.
1762,There is no doubt we will have a big wave of Covid when the border relaxes even a little.
1763,The only question is how long can we hold that off.
1764,"If we have Delta breaching MIQ every month, we will probably give up elimination by the end of the year."
1765,"If high vaccination lets us handle outbreaks through short local lockdowns, I expect we will keep borders closed and maintain elimination well into 2022, perhaps all year."
1766,"In total yes, but not necessarily per post, especially when you consider that people who post a lot also create more costs"
1767,"You mean the kids in kindergardens and primary schools are entirely on their own, with no grownups present?"
1768,But is that enough to drastically reduce the efficacy of vaccines?
1769,What sort of threshold needs to be crossed for that to happen?
1770,[removed]
1771,Exactly.
1772,That’s like saying there’s no point in washing your clothes because they’re just going to get dirty again.

The victim’s family should hold these nurses accountable and file a civil suit."
1777,Absolutely abhorrent.
1778,Is he like actively trying to kill people from banning mask mandates and doing things like this?
1779,"I mean it’s one thing for a state to not issue a statewide mask mandate for schools and just leave it up to each school district to decide, but it’s another thing to straight up ban mask mandates and fine those who want to mandate vaccines."
1780,"Yes, I'm not talking about some tiny place that consists of a half mile in NJ."
1781,"Real, major cities."
1782,Nope.
1783,"Here in LA county, we had some spread of Mu."

1792,Pretty sure the federal level mandate ranks above his  state level ego.
1793,F*ck that!
1794,If the hospitalisation rate for 2 dose regiment is so low why keep giving boosters to everyone?
1795,"This is true, but there's also another part that has bugged me since this all started."
1796,One of the results of previous pandemic threats like SARS or the Swine Flu was that public health shouldn't necessarily wait for the science when it comes to a new virus that they're needing time to study.
1797,"Many of the reports I read during the spring of 2020 recommended that public health should adopt the precautionary principle, essentially that they should assume the worst case scenario until they had good data to the contrary."
1798,"That would be that they should have assumed SARS-CoV-2 was an airborne respiratory virus, and implemented precautions for that, including universal masking."
1799,"It took the better part of a year to get good data on masking, and only in the last 6-8 months has the fact that it *is* airborne really started being accepted."
1800,So many lives could have been saved if various governments had followed those recommendations.
1801,Columbia Pictures
1802,"The thing is that the people who are most willing to take boosters are also the people who don't contribute much to spread in the first place, they're already fully vaccinated and more likely to social distance, etc."

1811,"I hope Biden offers to reimburse cities and counties that do mandate vaccines, and deduct it from Florida’s federal funding (which is approx $2100 per resident)."
1812,"&gt;Despite the increased resistance, “the Mu variant does not make vaccines ineffective, nor does it require new anti-virus measures at the individual level,” said Kei Sato, an associate professor of virology at the University of Tokyo’s Institute of Medical Science (IMS) and a member of the team."
1813,It's been more than a year and people still think this virus abides by the rules of Plague.

1817,You’re completely ignoring the data we already have for two shot vaccinated individuals.
1818,"Yea, delta is causing symptomatic sickness in some, but deaths and severe sickness is still incredibly low."
1819,"If the *entire world* was two shot vaccinated, we wouldn’t even be talking about Covid right now."
1820,This has nothing to do with equity for equity’s sake.
1821,"Just look at how delta even started, in an underdeveloped country with an abysmally low vaccination rate."
1822,I just don’t think chasing some 99% sterilizing vaccination threshold is realistic with a pathogen this evasive.
1823,"Let’s get everyone a baseline of protection first, and see what the data bears out from there."
1824,"We’re not even vaccinating kids yet, who are proving to be major vectors for delta."

1826,Hey y'all.
1827,"I don't follow covid discussions too much, but I wanted to post somewhere that my wife and I just made appointments for our third dose(Moderna)."
1828,"I was hoping WHO/CDC guidelines for non-immunocompromised people would be posted by now, but since we're personally at our 6 month mark from when we got our second dose(in March), I feel the potential risk of getting it now vs. later outweighs the risk of actual covid."
1829,Be safe everyone!
1830,Can anyone link me to data on the number of people hospitalized with non covid related illnesses that have not received treatment because of unvaccinated COVID hospitalizations?
1831,"I keep seeing this as one of the main proponents for mandates, but I’ve yet to actually see data on people having heart attacks and being turned away because “we have no space, sorry”."
1832,Is it a current issue or is it more of a hypothetical/preventative measure to take to avoid any strain on hospitals?
1833,Just want to see what that actual strain is.
1834,"No, they didn't go to medical school."
1835,"I believe all of them are nurses and techs, not physicians."
1836,"according to the latest Census data, it is definitely not the second most densely populated city in the US."
1837,"It is disputable if it was 2nd densest previously too, it depends on how you define ""city"""

1839,"No variant has (or likely will) completely neutralized all natural antibodies, but sometimes a previous infected person's antibodies will decline quickly and we don't always know why, so people like that may be completely unprotected."
1840,"If you keep your antibodies, though, I believe* that if you've been infected by a [variant that is closer in lineage](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/gisaid/global) to the new one, then you're better protected against it because it will behave and attach to your cells similarly to what your body has already seen in its prior infection."
1841,"Protection is also a scale, so we need to be mindful of how we use and interpret words like ""prevent."""
1842,"*I'm a covid-news-nerd, not a covid-scientist"
1843,They have the misinformation report option.
1844,I would report that way.
1845,I have no idea the level of seriousness they take for every report though.
1846,And the NBA season...
1847,"I got my shots in January, and when the choice between cancelling season tickets for this next season was offered in March, I kept my tickets thinking that everyone should be vaccinated by October and we'd be in a great spot."
1848,I was wrong.
1849,"I'll be masking up with N95s, but I'm still apprehensive about spending 3 hours in a crowded NBA arena."
1850,A booster certainly would provide some additional confidence 9 months after my first shot.
1851,"And believe me, I totally understand that it is more important to vaccinate the rest of the world than give someone like me a booster shot."
1852,"But if the data shows that a booster would help and there's shots available, I wouldn't turn it down."

1876,People are addicted to the fear.
1877,Tiny note to add - it's specifically possible due to antibodies binding the virus in a way that prevents the virus from infecting a cell in the first place.
1878,It's a high titer (concentration) of neutralizing antibodies that allows for sterilizing immunity.
1879,"For example, binding the receptor binding domain of the spike which is where we happen to see most antibodies raised against in humans - unclear reason why our immune systems are targeting that region mostly"
1880,I thought the point of masks wasn’t so much to filter the air (at least the fabric and blue medical masks) but to slow the air down as you breathe out to keep droplets from spreading as far.

1923,Little did a good job in 2020.
1924,"He followed the recommendations of the state health department, stuck with the disaster plan, ordered shutdowns when community spread was identified in the Treasure Valley (where Boise is), and refused to fight mask mandates."
1925,"For his efforts, he was pilloried by the far right (which is about 80% of the people who vote Republican in Idaho)."
1926,The Lt.
1927,Governor smelled blood in the water and started her push to run for his office.
1928,"Since Idaho did not see a New York City level event Idahoans began to believe idiotic ideas like,"" Well maybe we're just healthier here than in New York and live a different life and we just had silent spread in the fall of 2019."""
1929,"\[no, I am not kidding\]."
1930,At the same time Amon Bundy was running around being the asshat that he is.
1931,Gov.
1932,Little now knows that any push to force lockdowns or *any* kind of mandate will result in severe and immediate pushback from the far right in the state.
1933,"Worse, the insanely dumb Lieutenant Governor will almost certainly be a shoe-in for governor."
1934,"So, he's been trying to ride the edge."
1935,"It's a losing battle, but he knows the only chance the state has of not going full dumbass is if he can keep a lid on the crazy and somehow win the primary and upcoming election."
1936,"Don't get me wrong, I think Little has made some mistakes, but he has done a remarkably good job in an extremely conservative state."
1937,The problem is that far-right element and they keep finding new ways to go more insanely stupid.
1938,When hundreds of millions of tests are conducted there will be false positives.
1939,".0001 X 500,000,000 = 50,000

When you're symptomatic you will have a high viral load which is why antigen tests are only reliable then."
1940,I don't know why it's so difficult for people to understand that the author of this study could have just had the flu even if it's unlikely.
1941,Yes it's possible to have two negative antigen tests when you're symptomatic.
1942,Yes it's far more likely they had Covid based on the PCR test results.
1943,All I am suggesting is that based on what we know it's possible.
1944,This post appears to be about vaccines.

1947,*
1948,"Not anymore, they're not."
1949,That was the first wave.
1950,I worked through every wave of the pandemic in the ICU and in critical care.
1951,The high risk people who were vulnerable got vaccinated and it's helping those individuals.
1952,Admittedly some very few of them do end up in hospitals but their outcome look way better than unvaccinated.
1953,We're getting 30-50 year old unvaccinated; stlil rarer but more frequency of 18-30 y/o as well.
1954,Some look a little overweight.
1955,Some look regularly fit and healthy/skinny and athletic.
1956,They still need oxygen therapy.
1957,Some recover with just high flow nasal cannula.
1958,"Others require more intensive O2 therapy by using nonrebreather and on the list of o2 masks until finally despite how many support we throw at the patient, they keep desatting to critical levels that we intubate them."
1959,"I'm not sure how it is in other ICUs but in one ICU wing here, there's 10 beds for patients and 2 of those patients are overweight and 1 morbidly obese."
1960,The rest are actually within pretty good BMI.
1961,"I can't say if these 10 patients typically live a physically active life but at the very least being that they aren't obese or have health conditions due to weight, they are healthy."
1962,"But we're getting younger patients as higher frequency, higher frequency of cases where comorbidity isn't really a major factor rather than the disease of covid itself."
1963,Obviously this doesn't mean comorbidities are no longer a factor; but it does highlight that people who were not within the vulnerable risk group will need to be careful and take caution.
1964,There's no magic treatment plan to cure covid.
1965,Hospitals are basically supporting your body so that it can heal on its own.
1966,The vaccine is THE breakthrough that people have been waiting for in dealing with covid.
1967,"Once you get sick and end up in the hospital and you're fast tracking down the list of masks and quickly end up with the decision to get intubated and you're not a CRRT/ECMO candidate, you're outcome looks very bleak and it's too late to do anything."
1968,"&gt;With widespread vaccination, many of us will still be exposed, maybe even temporarily colonized, but it won’t often be a big deal."
1969,"Most of the time, we might not even notice."
1970,"Positive tests, too, may be less alarming: In the absence of symptoms, detecting hunks of virus might simply indicate that immune cells have squashed the pathogen, leaving only debris behind."
1971,Hear hear.
1972,[removed]
1973,Gen X has been bitter since birth.
1974,Source: I'm GenX
1975,Something is better than nothing in most cases.
1976,"Those masks restrict airflow, and generally take a filter disc with varying levels of protection."
1977,At the end of the day it all comes down to how good of a seal the mask is making with your face.
1978,That's great.
1979,I got the J&amp;J vaccine late March 2021.
1980,"There seemed to be a higher demand than supply at the time, so when I got an email to sign up for the J&amp;J, I listened to the ""experts""."
1981,"They said, get the first available, don't ""shop around""."
1982,Better to get one now than wait even a week or two.
1983,"I felt I should shop around, I wasn't happy with the efficacy rates compared to the other vaccines, and I wanted to feel good about getting back to normal."
1984,"But, of course, I followed the experts."
1985,"I reasoned, well, if everyone is excited to to get the vaccine, that means we will hit 70-90% soon enough, so while not ""herd immunity"" maybe, such high rates would make my lower efficacy less of an issue."
1986,Enter anti-vaxxers and Delta.
1987,Now my fear came true.
1988,I got the vaccine that I would have been happy with except for Delta and the huge number of unvaccinated don't give a crap types.
1989,"I feel I ""trapped"" myself with the J&amp;J, and not only am I not recommended to get another dose of the better vaccines, there is hardly and major news or research being released for me with the one I have."
1990,"This is unacceptable and strongly destroys my faith in ""the experts""."
1991,"While I feel the J&amp;J was the right choice given the circumstances back then, had I known how sad the support for it would be now, I would never have gotten it."
1992,"I assume it's back to more hibernating at home, no return to normal, or just accept if I mask up and try to distance, avoid crowds, I will still probably end up sick, with a moderate chance to end up seriously ill or hospitalized."
1993,"It appears I probably won't die, but even those other options don't sound to pretty."
1994,HR privacy rules!
1995,"Sure, it's just extremely very disingenuous to claim that the US has done more to help developing countries than all other nations combined, when the US contribution to the developing worlds total vaccine supply is only around 10%"
1996,Suburbs in Texas.
1997,I think in some cities hospitalizations are a problem but my area seems fine.
1998,It's been nice eating out and going to the movies like normal.
1999,Delta Airlines jumping with joy at this change.

Read how vaccines work."
2011,How would they know if booster immunity start waning at 5 months if they started applying boosters before that?
2012,I think you are confounding your facts.
2013,"Original immunity seems to wane at that time, the 4th dose claim was made as a precaution (this could happen, but we still don't know if or when)."
2014,"Not to mention all the vaccinated running around maskless, no distancing, living it up like it's 2019."
2015,"If you go to public/crowded spaces unmasked or willingly socialize with unvaccinated people, you are definitely part of the problem."
2016,"Just getting the vaccine is not enough at this point, everyone should know this by now and act accordingly."
2017,Im not really sure the point of this misery porn.
2018,The only people who read this stuff are people that...don't really need to be reached at this point.
2019,It just sort of feels like porn for the sake of porn.
2020,"Because many people have put all of their eggs in the vaccine basket, and now that it has become apparent that there are some holes in the basket, and a few eggs are falling through, they are dismayed."
2021,"The worst part to me is that many politicians, and way too many public voices in healthcare, have fed this lie for the last year."
2022,"Vaccines were never going to be the golden ticket out of this, they were only ever going to play a part."
2023,"Sorry folks, but welcome back to reality"

2031,And she'll be coming home to our unvaccinated 10 yo daughter.
2032,Thanks Mr. Government for reopening schools.
2033,Another issue is that treatment is useless once you've developed severe disease.
2034,"It has to be taken early and they're rationing it to ""vulnerable"" people."

2043,That’s awful.
2044,What do you mean?
2045,They saw a meme on Facebook that says it's a hoax!
2046,Why are migrants at the border not required to be vaccinated?
2047,This is so sad that peoplego so low as to scare workers and people trying to get this service
2048,"Then again, sterilizing immunity might not be too far off, even against delta."
2049,Mayo Clinic had a great podcast last week where they went over a study showing antibody titers and infection/breakthrough rates for the vaccinated in their health system.
2050,They showed that a third dose taken months after the 2nd creates significantly higher levels of antibodies than the standard two doses.
2051,The antibody levels they detected after a third dose are comparable to those who have had a prior infection and then also got vaccinated.
2052,So I am hopeful that the protection offered by the third dose will keep the vast majority of fully vaccinated safe from infection.
2053,"I don't see these as booster shots, either."
2054,The original goal was a two dose series with possible boosters if antibodies wane (and they do somewhat).
2055,"More concerning than waning antibody levels, however, is the rise of the delta variant combined with the alarming number of anti vaxxers, which have changed the situation on the ground."
2056,Now a three shot series should be the recommendation for all adults imho.
2057,Really I am starting to hate the term mild disease or whatever.
2058,"It seems it’s used like you said by people unaffected, and to mean didn’t die weren’t admitted."
2059,I know of peoples described as mild and they’ve got e to Er for ox supplements but not admitted to it’s considered mild.

Feb 1 - Aug 29 - Delta Variant

Of about half a million sequenced and genotyped Delta cases sampled...  1091 fully vaccinated deaths, and 536 unvaccinated."
2088,"So, mostly vaccinated deaths."
2089,"That seems just a wee bit higher than 1%, and it's exactly what you'd expect with an imbalance between 90-99% vaccinated elderly over that time, and almost no young people vaccinated."
2090,"This is just very bad selective data in the article, and hideously outdated."
2091,I had two Moderna shots and didn’t feel a thing.
2092,Both times scheduled my shot for Friday so if I had a reaction I wouldn’t miss work.

2094,The data is pretty accurate due to a massive study by the ONS and a few other organisations.
2095,"In the UK were largely back to normal, especially in England where you pretty much don't need masks anywhere anymore, except possibly public transport."
2096,Deaths aren't following the rise in cases.
2097,"Fully vaccinated deaths are still extremely low, something lie 1% of covid deaths are fully vaccinated people."

2121,Fucking shameful.
2122,"This morning, mine sent out an email that said ""We don't know if this applies to us yet, but we'll let you know when we know,"" aka, they have no clue what's going on yet and there's no change to the existing policy (full remote until next year minimum)."
2123,"They said there are risks to distributing boosters too soon, including the potential for side effects such as a rare heart inflammation condition known as myocarditis, which is more common after the second dose of mRNA vaccines."
2124,"“If unnecessary boosting causes significant adverse reactions, there could be implications for vaccine acceptance that go beyond COVID-19 vaccines,” they wrote."
2125,You may be right but having to have a qtip shoved into your brain once a week and being charged for it might change people's minds.
2126,They might hate it and be reluctant and it may backfire the next pandemic that comes around but they may it this time.
2127,It's this that people don't understand.
2128,The vaccine doses we're donating to other countries aren't being pulled out of your local pharmacy and reshipped.
2129,There's a stockpile specifically for that.
2130,"On the topic of a third shot, the data is clear as day."
2131,It helps.
2132,The CDC/WHO messaging on this entire pandemic has been dogshit from day 1.
2133,"Rolling back mask mandates was a terrible mistake, not recommending a third shot for reasons seems stupid."
2134,I bet next week we'll be discussing authorization for a third shot.
2135,If we had any balls we'd do what some countries did with a national vaccine passport.
2136,"You're free not to get vaxxed, you're also free to not put everyone else yourself included in danger by attending events with other people."
2137,Definitely not a limitation of contact tracing in Australia.
2138,We have such a low case count (some states are now increasing but most are covid-free).
2139,"For example, where I live not only do they contact trace but they do genomic sequencing - so we will get told how one case links to another case."
2140,"For example, we had a total of 5 new cases in the state 2 days ago."
2141,All the same family.
2142,They could trace that that family got it from someone that tested positive from another state.
2143,Or on other occasions they were able to find that a case in the community came from a returned traveller who was in hospital because of genomic sequencing.
2144,"I think you're still confusing positivity and case rate -- do you mean positive tests divided by the number of tests performed, or the number of positive cases divided by the number of staff+students?"
2145,"Also, 0.01% = 1 out of 10,000."
2146,"Is this a gigantic school system with 10,000 people and only one case?"
2147,"Even in the lowest Covid rate states, right now that would be a miraculously low number of cases for that many people."

2155,"Here in germany we have the mask mandate for everyone, vaccinated or not."
2156,"Very high vaccination rate would be needed to stop the spread alone, which we dont have."
2157,Therefore it seems reasonable to me to wear one in high risk scenarios (indoors or crowded areas outside).

2163,"And that ends the game for the virus as well, no matter how long the incubation period."
2164,The high lethality/high transmission strain would prevail for a short period.
2165,But then it kills its own environment and dies off.
2166,[removed]
2167,They need to expand this to immunity mandates.
2168,Proof of prior infection that produced antibodies should be treated the same as vaccination.
2169,"I realize the hesitancy as it might encourage people to go out and get infected, but the science says past infection is just as good as vaccination from an immunity perspective."
2170,"We need messaging that is sensible, science-based, and appeals to people on both sides."
2171,"Otherwise, we will just continue the same broken cycle…"
2172,Sorry for not answering the question but while I agree with the mandate I don't feel it's going to convince the anti-vaxxers because people who don't want to get the shot usually don't because they don't trust the government/people who made it so them being mandated isn't going to change that.
2173,Maybe a small number who really don't want to lose their jobs but not many.
2174,They finally did the research!

2176,Sometimes I question if I'm having some crazy fever dream seeing stuff like this.

2183,Yeah but it's not necessarily the job of journalists to interpret data.
2184,"They're supposed to research different reports, pick up a phone and call two experts and ask them about it."
2185,Then critically assess their sources.
2186,That's their job.
2187,Just two tidbits for you to pass on to your circle.
2188,About 5 billion vaccine doses have been administered worldwide.
2189,People have been coming to the ICU in their 20s and 30s and either dying or becoming disabled by the virus.
2190,"The R value invariably dropped because people changed their behavior, this was a good thing."
2191,"Unfortunately it's not dropping any more, because people aren't changing their behavior since ""they're vaccinated now""

This lack of other actions is going to drive a massive wave, just like doctors are predicting."
2192,"[https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-kingdom?view=daily-deaths&amp;tab=trend](https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-kingdom?view=daily-deaths&amp;tab=trend)

2193,"The current projection assumes everyone keeps using masks as much as they are currently, even if they're vaccinated."
2194,"I haven't been to the Bronx (or NYC) since the pandemic started, but assuming the Bronx functions similarly to the low income, majority-minority areas of my city, mask wearing was never much of a thing there."
2195,"After all, if they were taking COVID seriously, wouldn't they have gotten vaccinated?"
2196,Yeah people point to India but why on earth are people trusting the data quality?
2197,You should worry less now that you are vaccinated.
2198,Most likely you wont get a severe illness.
2199,"You still could catch it with mild symptoms or totally asymptomatic, and then, in a smaller tiemframe than unvaccinated, but still infect others."
2200,Which you probably dont want.
2201,"So, to stop the spread one should still mask up."
2202,With the poor vaccination rates the upcoming (or already existing) wave can not be kept in place with vaccines alone.

2216,"Endemic covid is best dealt with by dealing with local outbreaks, and outbreaks will be most needful of intervention precisely where they won't listen to sense."

2240,"&gt;Sept. 13 (UPI) -- Fourteen elderly residents of a French nursing home developed [COVID-19](https://www.upi.com/topic/COVID-19/ ""https://www.upi.com/topic/COVID-19/"") during an outbreak at the facility, despite being fully vaccinated against the virus, a study published Monday by [JAMA Network Open](http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.25294?utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;utm_term=091321 ""http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.25294?utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;utm_term=091321"")  found."
2241,"&gt;The outbreak affected one in five of the fully vaccinated residents of the facility and also included two who were partially vaccinated -- they had received one dose of the two-shot Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine -- and one who was not vaccinated, the data showed."
2242,"&gt;Of the 17 total residents infected, eight developed severe illness, two were hospitalized and one -- the person who had not been vaccinated -- died."
2243,"&gt;All of the cases involved the Alpha, or ""U.K.,"" variant, researchers said."
2244,"&gt;At the time of the outbreak, 70 of the 74 residents were fully vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, while two were partially vaccinated, meaning they had received one dose of the two-shot vaccine."
2245,"&gt;Two of the nursing home residents were not vaccinated, according to the researchers."
2246,"&gt;Along with the outbreak among residents, 12 of the 102 facility staff members also were infected, the data showed."
2247,"&gt;However, only one-third of the staff was fully vaccinated at the time of the outbreak, the researchers said."
2248,"&gt;Of the 12 cases, nine occurred in unvaccinated staff members, according to the researchers."
2249,"&gt;None of the infected staff members developed serious illness, they said."
2250,"&gt;""Outbreaks can occur in nursing homes, even if residents are fully vaccinated,"" Belin said."
2251,"&gt;Still, ""it is important that staff members, visitors and family members of residents in contact with them also be vaccinated against COVID-19,"" he said."
2252,"Oh, do you think the flu is more dangerous because we haven't been exposed to it in a while?"
2253,"But yeah, I'm fine to mask up for as much as is needed but I'm worried that where I'm moving (a no mask mandate area) barely anyone wears masks anymore."
2254,Well too bad I got my third shot along with my parents and hopefully my brother in a week or two.

2276,"I guess I'm more worried about infecting others in my family than myself, even though everyone is also fully vaccinated."
2277,It makes sense here in Australia when our case count is so low.
2278,Where I am we are (and have been pretty much since around mid 2020) living covid-free.
2279,We had a locally transmitted delta case last week.
2280,"It was a student in a school, so the entire school and their families went into 14 days stay at home quarantine and they listed any exposure sites and anyone who had been there also goes into quarantine."
2281,"Over 1,000 people quarantined at home."
2282,Everyone else can keep living normally.
2283,It’s worked so far - last time the case count from one case got to about 150 but pretty much most of them were in home quarantine when they tested positive so weren’t infectious in the community.
2284,(We have had a total of 7 covid deaths in our state of 5 million since the pandemic started).
2285,I think once covid get outs of control contact tracing becomes too difficult.
2286,"&gt;""“Seriously people — STOP BUYING MASKS!” the surgeon general, Jerome M. Adams, said in a tweet on Saturday morning."
2287,"“They are NOT effective in preventing general public from catching #Coronavirus, but if health care providers can’t get them to care for sick patients, it puts them and our communities at risk!”""

This is exactly what I was talking about."
2288,Letting a hysteric population without adequate knowledge deplete mask stocks at gouged prices while healthcare workers cannot access them is definitely detrimental to public health.
2289,"&gt;“There’s no evidence that wearing masks on healthy people will protect them,”

This was definitely correct at the time, and this statement is not something that indicates incompetence."
2290,"The basic principles of evidence based medicine dictate that nothing should be administered without having conclusive evidence that it works in the specific setting and context of use, in the absence of a highly probable and large net benefit, which was definitely not the case in early 2020."
2291,"&gt;They wear them incorrectly, and they can increase the risk of infection because they’re touching their face more often.”

This is still true, however there is now a large body of evidence that does conclusively indicate that *public usage of masks* is beneficial regardless of this."
2292,All the quotes you posted just prove that we had known of the (obvious) protection of masks against COVID.
2293,But we did not know if public usage of them was beneficial from a public health standpoint.

2300,"I think everyone should mask up to help quash the pandemic, but vaccinated people shouldn't worry overly much about themselves."

2315,"I would buy some N95s, they go by around a dollar."
2316,Specially in crowded areas or indoors id wear them.
2317,Pfizer protects you well against severe illness.
2318,Often you hear numbers around 90% depending on which severity of infection you look at.
2319,You probably wouldnt care much to get a mild infection.
2320,That being said health experts advice vaccinated to not challenge an infection anyways.
2321,"The endemic character of covid, the fact that it will never go away, will lead to everyone coming in contact with the virus sooner or later."
2322,But the vaccination will significantly reduce the risk as far as i understand the statements of our experts.
2323,"&gt;As required by law, school nurses, administrators and school staff will continue to address positive, presumptive or confirmed cases of COVID-19."
2324,"All students and staff who do not have a positive COVID-19 test or symptoms, should return to school or work immediately."
2325,I’m confused about what this means.
2326,"Does this mean, for example, if there was a possibility of exposure and then a negative test the person can return to school?"
2327,"Or does this mean regardless of exposure, no test or quarantine is necessary?"
2328,Good question and I wish I understood this will enough to answer.
2329,Maybe someone in the know will chime in.
2330,No not really.
2331,It allows the numbers to go down and normalcy to return.
2332,Next step will be to reduce testing and start to accept covid as our friend /s
2333,"One fatal flaw, if they're actually anti-social then they are almost assuredly not spreading it."
2334,If I'm fully vaccinated should I still be very worried about the delta variant and wear a mask?
2335,There's a mask mandate where I live and even if there wasn't I'm quite worried and would wear one anyway but is my fear irrational?
2336,If I'm fully vaccinated should I have to worry less?
2337,I'll admit since I've been fully vaccinated I've not changed my behavior at all in terms of social distancing and masks.
2338,That’s a really conflicting statement that makes zero sense.

2373,A battle between the sane and insane is imminent.
2374,"I think it is a very dangerous thing to completely ignore covid because of the the more dangerous varients that are coming out from the unvacinated and vaccinated population, that can lead to needing a different vacnine for a different covid varient."
2375,I have been trying to figure this out and was curious.
2376,"I was reading that the side effects we get within the first day or two is the innate immune system, and we are basically having an inflammatory response, but the real protection from the vaccine develops over a couple weeks (adaptive immunity)."
2377,"So people can essentially have zero side effects to the vaccine ( first shot, second shot, or booster) and still have a good level of immunity."
2378,"I was hopeful that my nasty side effects meant I was more protected, but that doesn’t seem to be the case."
2379,"Science folks, am I understanding this right?"
2380,"Ah, thank you for clarifying."
2381,That makes perfect sense.
2382,Your link has a lot of valid data although it’s labeled as a financial projection of sorts; I should’ve just asked you to clarify instead of presuming the worst.
2383,Sorry about that.
2384,Why can't we have a states for vaccinated and ones for unvaccinated.
2385,They can even have their own government and president and their own money.
2386,"No more California and New York providing school lunches for kids in Texas, Florida, Mississippi."
2387,You get the point.
2388,"NJ is not NY, but we are 62.7% fully vaccinated."
2389,No one will get to 85% until the vaccine is approved for kids.
2390,There is just too much of the population under 12 years old.
2391,This was DeSantis' 'Dr.

2393,When she sat next to Trump's podium and offered no clarification on his claim that cleaners and light could be injected into the body.
2394,"DeSantis had the same look as he looked at the speaker, looked down with a look of concern or puzzlement, and looked up at the speaker again like he wanted to say something...but then didn't."
2395,"Behind an official state seal on a podium, he let that statement stand."
2396,"Our citizens are now being advised, apparently, by non-scientist citizens at random, I guess?"
2397,This is embarrassing.
2398,Those people need to protect themselves.
2399,I have nothing else to say.
2400,Comparing returning to normal life to swinging a sword is pure hyperbole.
2401,Hospitals are doing fine everywhere except a few over publicized locations.
2402,Get over it.
2403,This is not the horrible thing you pretend it is.
2404,You are spreading false information.
2405,Your data is completely based on edge cases and extreme possibilities.
2406,"Please review the CDC information: [https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6930e1.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6930e1.htm)

2407,"Either way, I am done responding to you and I will block you now."
2408,&gt;Yeah with cancer so often it comes back years later.
2409,"With covid you dont have that

Uhhh... you can definitely catch covid more than once."
2410,"Don’t listen to him, even with delta the way out of this was ALWAYS getting people vaccinated and those not getting the vaccine gradually gaining immunity until the virus is manageable and endemic like the flu."
2411,If you’re vaccinated do whatever you want.
2412,I don’t know anybody still social distancing or doing the bubble bullshit.
2413,"That’s long, long, long gone."

2500,I am not being derisive.
2501,The phase 1 numbers on booster shots are amazingly good.
2502,It's inexplicable that anyone is arguing against them.
2503,Their arguments are that we don't have enough data - but since we're not trying to get any data (by running phase 3s) this is nonsensical.
2504,Congrats on being in remission.
2505,"Depends on age too.. like a 90 year old vaccinated versus unvaccinated the advantage may be considerably less than a 40 year old who was very likely to survive with minimal issues, where the vaccine bats it out of the park."
2506,The Republican Supreme Court can probably overturn most of those if they have a mind to
2507,"Yes, but for the recovering cancer patient it may only be a minute help (they can get a booster later but there is uncertainty how long it can be)."
2508,Even better if everyone around them who can have the vaccine does.
2509,Just heard that a friend’s mom died of COVID in Florida.
2510,She had both shots but was immunocompromised and likely got it at the grocery store.
2511,"Fuck Ron Desantis and anyone else who is spreading anti-vaccine nonsense, or is “hesitant,” or who “wants to do their own research.” They’re killing vulnerable people."
2512,"Then there's me, where I either have great protection or none lol."
2513,"I have psoriasis and usually take biologic immunosuppressant injections to control it, but I stopped last fall when the vaccines were coming."
2514,"There was really no clear answer on whether to stop injections prior or not, so I did."
2515,"Anyways, I got my first dose in March, tested positive for COVID three days later, and then got better and got my second dose on time in April."
2516,I'm the only person I know who got COVID between doses.
2517,"My psoriasis got really really bad a few months back, so I went back on the injections."
2518,Because of them I was advised to get the third booster which I did about 3 weeks ago.
2519,So....
2520,I have 3 vaccine doses and had COVID all within the past 6 months.
2521,But I have a very suppressed immune system and the studies are only now coming together on effectiveness of the vaccine with immunosuppressants.
2522,"I'm not too worried about getting it again (or dying if I do I guess), but I was very sick last time (103-104 fever) despite having a functioning immune system at the time."
2523,Just so much uncertainty.
2524,"It's understandable, but I am hoping for a little clarity."
2525,[removed]
2526,RemindMe!
2527,5 hours
2528,It certainly did for me when I got it back in March.
2529,"Well, in parts of Wake County at least, I’m not surprised."
2530,I know some of the smaller towns don’t have mask mandates.
2531,"I know Raleigh and Cary both do, and a few others, I think."
2532,Yep.
2533,This is also a good reason why valuable shots should not go to those with confirmed natural immunity.
2534,"At more than 37k new cases per day, that's higher than at any point in 2020."
2535,"Even currently, the FDA hasn't approved booster shots for the the general population."
2536,"""When can I get a COVID-19 vaccine booster?"
2537,Not immediately.
2538,"The goal is for people to start receiving a COVID-19 booster shot beginning in the fall, with individuals being eligible starting 8 months after they received their second dose of an mRNA vaccine (either Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna)."
2539,This is subject to authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and recommendation by CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP).
2540,FDA is conducting an independent evaluation to determine the safety and effectiveness of a booster dose of the mRNA vaccines.
2541,"ACIP will decide whether to issue a booster dose recommendation based on a thorough review of the evidence."""
2542,"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/booster-shot.html

HHS has announced the plan, but the FDA hasn't approved it yet."
2543,The meeting is this Friday.
2544,"&gt; ""what's the union going to do when the mandate comes down?"""
2545,"""Help enforce it"""
2546,No doubt
2547,But but but pharma won’t make a quadrillion this year before Christmas.
2548,bye bye job!
2549,I read it like cancer treatment wasn’t as gnarly as covid was.
2550,"Love this, wish more stores would do this."
2551,So much easier to carry as well
2552,oh jeez
2553,There is nothing public on the CDC ACIP agenda relating to covid right now.
2554,There's a draft agenda for a meeting on September 29th about a bunch of non-COVID vaccines.
2555,"see https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/agenda-archive.html

It is however, entirely possible that between now and then: 

 * FDA will pull together a coherent justification and authorize boosters for some subset of the population

 * CDC ACIP will schedule a snap meeting to discuss recommending them."
2556,but there is nothing public yet.
2557,Some people are forced to work in the public.
2558,If you are doing risky things around them you are imposing that risk on them.
2559,This isn't hard to understand.
2560,Think of it like swinging a sword around as you walk down the street.
2561,"""I accept the risk that this might hit me and injure or possibly even kill me"" doesn't really cut it."
2562,Because you are imposing the risk of injury or death on other people.
2563,Covid is still in the acute phase.
2564,"Hospital systems are still in a failed state, completely overwhelmed, with people dying of preventable causes because beds are full."
2565,I have provided links to studies in this thread.
2566,The only misinformation here is your 90% figure.
2567,[removed]
2568,"Yes, every group is susceptible, but the numbers don't lie."
2569,"Here in Italy the 20-29 age bracket has more vaccinated than both the 30-39 and 40-49, and is on track to overtake the 50-59 bracket as well."
2570,Despite vaccinations opening an entire month earlier for the over 50.
2571,"The 12-19 bracket, which opened even later, is also doing very good."
2572,"Also, if you look at a video of any of the anti vaccine protests, you can easily see that it's literally all over 50s."
2573,This post appears to be about vaccines.
2574,"We encourage you to read our helpful resources on the COVID-19 vaccines:

2578,Thank you!
2579,"Again, seems like Australia has also missed the mark with vaccines yet again."
2580,"We should have been more swift with learning from overseas data, yet even now we are still doing 3 week intervals in areas with no community transmission of COVID."
2581,Only hotspot areas are doing 8 week intervals.
2582,So longer intervals mean less risk for side effects… okay so what is the OP article talking about then?
2583,Seems like boosters are completely safe.
2584,"As a counter, I got a Moderna booster after 2 doses of Pfizer and my lymph node in the armpit on side of injection was swollen, and side effects were much worse than both of my Pfizer doses combined."
2585,"Gee, maybe there's a difference between the general population and a bunch of the most sick and vulnerable group crammed into one living space."
2586,I think the virus has just run its course through the population.

2600,What if two judges disagree?
2601,Which judge gets the final decision?
2602,"What if a judge from one state says something is a fact, while a judge from a different state says it’s not?"

2642,"It was no problem for me at all to get third dose; pharmacist did not even ask why I was getting it, just asked if was my second, third, or first (in that order)."
2643,Our national advisory council also just recommended third doses for immunosuppressed so should be easier now for other provinces who haven’t moved to allow third dosing to consider it.

2673,does this surprise anyone?
2674,What is the implication for vaccines?
2675,I got it because of a medication that I'm on that lowers some of my white blood cell counts.
2676,"I know that there's been controversy over giving third doses to the general public because it's based on limited data and because very unfortunately, there are still plenty of people around the world waiting for a first dose."
2677,I don't have answers as to what the right thing to do is (ideally we would be able to get the first two doses available to everyone worldwide).
2678,"But if I wasn't on this medication, and a third dose rolled out to the general public, I would likely still get it because of my concerns about breakthrough infections especially with the delta variant (and I have a child at home who is too young to be vaccinated)."
2679,What about the people that say the vaccinated will all die in 6 months.

2725,"Yes, absolutely, 100%."
2726,But to just pretend that there isn’t a genuine worry amongst pregnant women about getting the (or any) vaccine doesn’t achieve anything.

2879,"You are definitely right, and now having had the chance to read the biorxiv  link you provided (which I thank you for) I definitely retract my statement specifically regarding my undersganding of the scope of the study."
2880,"That being said, there's some faults I find in their methodology, and the scope is very limited (and the paper is too new to be replicated) The CD147 receptor was confirmed as a secondary viral entry point."
2881,"The authors in the study below used knock In mice with hCD147 and showed viral entry in that platform, given no other receptors

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-020-00426-x

They point to the ""rather low"" ACE2 percentage in the lungs I."
2882,"The introduction however, that's a bit misleading when you can't remove the fact that the majority of studied human cases and hospitalizable cases occur in individuals trend generally above the mean age of 32."
2883,"The mean age for hospitalization Is somewhere around 60 or so, and they would have overwhelming amounts of ACE2 in their lungs, not just CD147."
2884,ACE2 is also available in overwhelming quantities in the Pericytes.
2885,"So to point out that CD147 mediated viral entry contributes to inflammation in the heart, I believe it."
2886,But to make the claim its ~leading ~ needs a lot more evidence.
2887,I don't discount it though.
2888,In the study you linked they described it in the condition of just the spike protein.
2889,Even in the serological tests.
2890,"They identified it as a non infectious route in vitro which is not supported by other in vivo studies

They also used the Sera only to show S protein was present in seroconverted blood, but what they did not used pericytes  from those individuals though which would have been very different 5-10 days post infection, having already been infected through the ACE2 entry pathway."
2891,"They point to the mechanism of pericyte damage caused by release of interleukins and cytokines, which In an in vivo disease model would have been free floating in the Sera and would have already been causing apoptosis in the heart, especially from pericytes infected through ACE2."
2892,"They also normalized spike concentration data by age, and instead it would have been better to used a weighted normalization based on the national median age of infection,  or the median age of cardiac failure due to covid inflammation."
2893,"The other thing, and one variable they admit to in the discussion section is the inability to properly distinguish Spike without any other structures in the sero samples."
2894,Which would not be ~JUST~ spike in vivo.
2895,"The in vitro study does suggest that their proposal for binding does occur in their recombinant cells though using homemade spike, which they support through a citation to likely be using the S1 subunit which would be in closed conformation."
2896,Which is definitely some good new information.
2897,"So you pointed out some faults in my initial understanding, but a lot of what I read still supports the other stuff I've read."
2898,"Since this study is super super limited in scope, their implication that pericyte inflammation is more specifically mediated by cd147 than other entry points is a bit misleading in the lack of other variables accounted for, but is supported under the specific scope."
2899,"This has less Clear implications during covid infection, and more so implications outside of coivd infection with lasting heart inflammation after the virus has cleared, given that is when the soluble S protein in concentrations lower than replicating virus would be present and be the more likely cause of inflammation in those cases."
2900,"Or this how I've interpreted the study, science is interpretable, and you can gather lots of different perceptions from the same text."

2917,My fingers are so crossed too!!!
2918,And then I wonder about 6 months and up?
2919,!
2920,I am not sure what his reasoning was but it seems clear to me that opening schools in any area is going to be a major driver of cases.
2921,I'm in DC metro and our schools opened about 3 weeks ago.
2922,So whatever effect is coming from that has probably already started.
2923,"In other areas, schools started the Tuesday after Labor Day which was last week."
2924,But in my area there were few restrictions all summer basically everything opened up at Memorial Day.
2925,So a little hard to tell.
2926,Where did you see under 5 is a month behind?
2927,Extremely curious because I have a 4 year old and 3 month old.
2928,And wondering if 2-4 is next or is it 6 mo-4?
2929,!
2930,Does any country need millions of judges because it's illegal to slander people and to scam people or because it's illegal to smoke cigarettes in certain areas?
2931,"It works like, if you see a breach of law, you can make a case."
2932,And then the case gets scheduled when there's time for it.
2933,I don't really understand?
2934,All countries always have laws that can get broken constantly every day by a lot of people - like speed limits in trafic.
2935,Why is it suddenly impossible to make such laws any more?
2936,"I think with your argument, we could also claim it's impossible to make laws for speed limits ""because we'd need millions of judges to monitor every single car."""
2937,"But obviously it is possible, right?"
2938,A law about not saying false things this would work like speed limits work in most countries I guess.
2939,"A lot of people would get away with breaking it, and then habitual breaker would get a fine once in a while."
2940,It also depends how the law is made.
2941,"Maybe you'd say ""you're not allowed to say false things and claim it is the mainstream scientific view."""
2942,"But you would be allowed to say ""I have no scientific basis for this but I think that..."" Probably this could never be illegal."
2943,It's like this for products already no?
2944,"I mean, I don't think it's legal in USA to sell a product and claim science says it makes you loose 100 pounds in a day."
2945,It felt like delta
2946,"i would ask them about the long term effects of covid, have they done the math for their risk of exposure times the average impact of getting covid?"
2947,"not median impact (that's essentially ""mild"" for most of us) but average impact."
2948,have they don't a bayesian analysis of the possibilities and their costs to get a true risk analysis?
2949,"assuming that they have already done that for covid, they can do something similar for the vaccine."
2950,"they can find all the numbers for average medicines/vaccines, what % have what side effect and weigh the two answers against each other to decide what to do."
2951,"oh wait, don't let them forget about quarantine time off work, health care costs, or other side effects of one choice or the other"
2952,Most Covid vaccines (including both mRNA ones)have their spikes prefusion-stablized and cannot bind to cells.
2953,"https://cen.acs.org/pharmaceuticals/vaccines/tiny-tweak-behind-COVID-19/98/i38

Basically the spike have ""on"" and ""off"" positions, Pfizer, Moderna and JnJ all have spikes locked in ""off"" position and can't bind to a human cell receptor."
2954,"&gt;(the other way to make people move against firmly held beliefs is sex, but I don't know if we can whore our way out of this one...)

Not with *that* attitude, we can't."
2955,"Yes, but I guess my argument is that by lumping them together they are artificially inflating the death rates for those diseases."
2956,It doesn't mean much but matters for optics - I would argue that COVID-19 has killed more people than pneumonia or the flu when they are separated.

2975,A court can have to decide about where it was unsafe practice to use some technological gizmo in a car.

3122,Small consolation for the dead.
3123,Fingers crossed this holds.
3124,It seems like it’s too early to credit the 3rd booster for the drop.
3125,I’m guessing it’s moreso the virus ran through the unvaccinated and it’s finding fewer susceptible people.
3126,Still - with covid we need to all learn not to get carried away and think we’ve got it beat until we do.
3127,"Well, if you can, please be cautious of the kids in your family."
3128,These variants seem to circle the globe fairly quickly.
3129,You may end up with whatever we have going here.
3130,My son is recovering from 104 fevers and some nasty symptoms.
3131,A high school kid just died at my nephews school in NC.
3132,"leviticus 13 45-46 for masking up, notifying people you are I'll, and quarantining"
3133,The outcome of covid ought to be that people take their weigh problems more seriously.
3134,Obesity + Covid is a killer.
3135,Ok
3136,I appreciate your efforts and the information you’re sharing.
3137,"What truly terrifies me is long COVID, and I think these morons/stubborn fools/people confused people by misinformation maybe would feel differently once more about this becomes clear - that you don’t survive covid unscathed."
3138,"I’m trying to understand the psychology of these people who are reacting in stubborn and deplorable ways in response to this pandemic, I think they’re generally angry and irrational and would rather take up an attitude of defiance - so to feel some kind of personal power, and like they’re fighting for ‘something’ (the right to be stupid and delusional about what’s going on, to be utterly idiotic) - than to face the reality of what we are dealing w and behave in a way that makes the most sense for public good."
3139,"It’s hard not to get infuriated by them, like I lose respect for people so fast over this shit."
3140,nice!
3141,thanks!
3142,"The criminalization of HIV was a mistake and society, at least in recent years, was increasingly recognizing that."
3143,"Anyways, don’t mistake my concerns for to be anti vax."
3144,"In vaccinated, I think everyone else should be do."
3145,But I am not on board with “any policy in the name of public safety” as that is increasingly appears to be the route we are going.
3146,The social end to the pandemic's hit us weeks ago.
3147,The authors aren't medical doctors and the paper covers their analysis of other studies and is not in itself a study.
3148,Mild to moderate can get pretty dang rough.
3149,It really is just about anything and everything but hospitalized.
3150,https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/overview/clinical-spectrum/
3151,I wouldn't want my baby delivered there with unvaccinated workers anyways.
3152,For me it would depend on how much you trust your in-laws general risk mitigation.
3153,"I'm comfortable with my 4 year old seeing my extended family and our close adult friends because:

1."
3154,"They are all vaccinated
2."
3155,"They practice similar risk mitigation as our family does - wearing high quality masks in public indoor spaces, no dining inside at restaurants, not attending crowded indoor events."
3156,If my family needed to fly to see us and f they're willing to wear kn95 masks in the airport and plane then I wouldn't be worried.
3157,But if you don't have a high level of comfort with how much risk your in-laws take you can always say that you want to wait for your son to be vaccinated.
3158,The FDA is finally giving us some semblance of a timeljne and it's likely 2 and up will be eligible by sometime in November.
3159,Thank you.
3160,"I’m an RN on a Covid unit, fully vaccinated."
3161,This job isn’t easy at all.
3162,These comments are very disrespectful from people who aren’t nurses &amp; know what we really do.
3163,It’s not just tasks.
3164,It’s also critical thinking skills as well.
3165,I’m sure a lot of people could not do our job.
3166,I jumped at the chance for the TDaP shot when I was pregnant.
3167,Protect my newborn from pertussis?
3168,Heck yes!
3169,"Just for anyone that doesn't know, newborns can't get the DTaP/TDaP shot right away."
3170,I think one year old is the soonest.
3171,"Diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis."
3172,"Pertussis is a really nasty respiratory infection that can kill babies, so if you are going to be around a new baby a lot, make sure you get yours updated!"
3173,"It wears off every 7 years, iirc."
3174,Thanks.
3175,Didn’t mean to snap.
3176,I’ve had an awful weekend.
3177,My dog has been gone for almost three months now.
3178,And I e just been spiraling into a nihilistic existential depression.
3179,Nothing seems to matter except not dying of a horrible disease.
3180,Anti Vax are taking this as malicious but it’s really not.
3181,All Pfizer is saying is that Israel provides it with a good sample for its effectiveness since they use almost entirely Pfizer and they vaccinated very early in part because of this deal to share lots of info.
3182,"As such Pfizer can use Israel to look ahead and see if immunity wanes, how 3rd and 4th boosters change the equation etc,"
3183,I have a toddler so we probably won't see anything for his age group until next year.
3184,Just effin sucks.
3185,Mine are not either.
3186,And will still be too young for the next wave of 5-11 year olds gets approved.
3187,It’s so stressful.
3188,disclaimer: im not in health care.
3189,I think its saying that all of us have a spike protein in our blood that's a lot like the spikes on COVID.
3190,"I don't mean we've all gotten it recently, I mean, like probably for hundreds of years humans have had this protein in their blood."
3191,It just happens to be a doppleganger for COVID's spike.
3192,They get mistaken for twins all the time when they run into each other at the grocery store.
3193,We also have an anti-spike protein in our blood that causes swelling.
3194,"Before COVID, if your body was in balance, non-COVID friendly spike proteins would interact with the friendly anti-spike proteins throughout your body and change them into something else that doesn't make the area swell."
3195,This would suppress the anti-spike proteins everywhere and there wouldn't be any swelling.
3196,"When you catch COVID, the immune system identifies anyone wearing spikes as a ""bad person"" and orders all of them executed."
3197,"For some people, one of two things is happening: 1) the immune system executes a ton of friendly spikes, too, or 2) the blood isn't getting enough new friendly spike replacements after COVID is under control."
3198,"This throws the balance off and allows the friendly anti-spikes to go bananas, at least in some areas."
3199,"This causes lots of swelling, and I think this triggers another immune system response."
3200,This appears to be the mechanism causing long-term COVID.
3201,"The article doesnt say this, but the people who defeat COVID fairly easily must be doing something different."
3202,"maybe protecting their friendly spikes, replenishing them well to keep the blood in balance, or their immune system undergoes a shift post-infection to stop attacking friendly spikes."
3203,maybe something else more complicated.

3235,You're flipping between two good numbers.
3236,"There's the ""% of eligible people that have a vaccination shot"" and then there's the ""total number of people who don't have a vaccination shot""."
3237,"Both are worth tracking, but in this case, there's 13ish million Californians who either can't get vaccination (kids almost entirely) or have chosen to not be vaccinated."
3238,Both have their purposes and times to be looked at.
3239,The total population of Mississippi is only 3ish million.
3240,"The percentages are different, but that's a less relevant number to someone who is in San Francisco who picks Mississippi as a location for the set of problems that unmasked, unvaccinated people create."
3241,There's a lot more of them in California and maybe in the SFO area (almost 8 million population).
3242,"To use a horror movie metaphor: the calls are coming from everywhere, especially inside the home of someone living in California."
3243,"I was describing a trend, not an unalienable fact."
3244,So they can still be correlated even if exceptions exist.
3245, I am immune-compromised and had a 3rd dose of Moderna in accordance w/  my doctor's recommendation.
3246,"I had to provide a doctor's note to the pharmacy that was administering my dose, so in my experience they are checking."
3247,Could just be my city/state?
3248,I do have mixed feelings about receiving a 3rd dose when other countries are begging for the 1st.
3249,"However, I am one of those ""high risk"" people and the efficacy rate for me is not what it would be for a ""normal"" person."
3250,"AND given the spread of Delta along with the unvaccinated running around like Typhoid Marys/Harrys, I feel better with a little more protection."

3253,"For someone in that situation, I would think the flu is also a life threatening item."
3254,"Hopefully, in a few years, it will reduce to a seasonal thing and she'll be able to operate as she did with only the flu."
3255,Until then I think she should do what she is doing and get boosters just in case they help at all.
3256,"FWIW, I have been exposed to Covid in my house twice and have no antibodies."
3257,I'm not sure those tests are perfect.
3258,I've searched and searched and I can't find the first two articles I saw it in.
3259,But I did find a NYPost article that lays out a similar timeline: Pfizer submitting data for 2-4 year olds to the FDA in early October.
3260,"I tried to link it, but the comment was automatically removed due to the source."
3261,The 6 months-2 years approval is usually estimated to be late 2021/early 2022.
3262,I've seen several articles lump the two youngest cohorts together and say approval for 6 months and up isn't expected until next year.
3263,But I don't think those timelines are as accurate as the ones that break the 6m-2 and 2-4 groups apart.

3265,It is a crime to knowingly give someone HIV.
3266,The nature of rights and viruses depends on how they are transmitted because it's harder to prove who was the source.
3267,But right now people can knowingly have Covid and spread it around largely without consequence.
3268,And you think we should focus more on the rights of people who do this on a mass scale rather than protect the potentially vulnerable victims who get the virus.
3269,"And many vulnerable people are still dying from the virus despite being vaccinated, whereas HIV isn't a death sentence anymore."
3270,Dying in the most horrible way as their lungs fill up with fluid.
3271,Where are their rights?
3272,Smoking was banned inside venues to protect public health.
3273,Covid is a million times for harmful because it spreads so rapidly so those clubbers or people watching the EUROs go home and give it to their families.
3274,Second hand smoke doesnt keep replicating and spreading.
3275,Other people's selfish health decisions shouldnt be forced onto the majority who did the right thing.
3276,Clubs wouldn't even be open now if so many people hadnt got vaccinated.
3277,So then your claim sounds silly lol

3279,"My wife has Lupus, just got her third shot this weekend."
3280,"We have managed to avoid it so far, vaccinated as soon as we were eligible, wear masks, stay clean, etc... As someone who has not even had the flu over the last 25 years, I do think it is possible to not end up getting COVID."
3281,"As for what our lives will be like, they are most likely never going back to what they were pre-COVID, and I think those with immune-compromised systems, and their loved ones, should start accepting that fact now."
3282,"My faith in humanity went down the shitter some time last year, and its not coming back."

3326,So thank you for what you're doing.
3327,"ok, let me know how it goes!"
3328,Since we are in the same state.
3329,I am greatly excited for this.
3330,I hate the wait in the pediatricians office with all the sick kids running around and we are there just for a flu shot.
3331,"No, many are not, a few quackers, sure."
3332,"Nope, just the CDC doesn’t want to cause panic."
3333,There’s a reason we get vaccinated for the flu; it kills 30k a year.
3334,They’re part of our way out.
3335,"It won’t get us herd immunity with just vaccines, ough it helps"
3336,Many in the medical establishment are administering ivermectin to fight covid.
3337,Your loss
3338,Oh that makes sense.
3339,"I dunno, it says “nationwide”, but we’ll see."
3340,The appointment is next Friday.
3341,Our peds office doesn’t have their vaccines yet and we have a long weekend coming up (Preschool closed the following Monday).
3342,I thought if she might have a fever or something an extra day to get over it would be good.
3343,"Plus, they are not playing at the Preschool, no fever for 24 hours, and I don’t want to have to keep her home because of a fever from the flu shot and end up having to get a COVID test for protocol."
3344,Hopefully they'll all start losing their jobs.
3345,Not surprised.
3346,Am from Florida.
3347,Recently found out my sister was antivax.
3348,Says that if her baby can't get the vaccine then she can't.
3349,She works in a daycare.
3350,None of my other siblings have been vaccinated either.
3351,Even worse they live at home with my (early 60s parents).
3352,Thankfully my parents are onboard with vaccines and have been vaccinated for a while now.
3353,Hehehe my girl and I were joking earlier about the horse wormer people.

3363,Are false positive PCR common?
3364,I know false negatives are but positive?
3365,Thanks.
3366,I wonder how many of these would have been hospital cases if not for the overwhelmed system.
3367,"Seems like we should just be putting up billboards saying how many of the people who've answered surveys with ""I'm never getting vaccinated"" are going to die."
3368,"We should be able to make a decent estimate, right?"
3369,"If every city was filled with billboards saying, ""We know 17,142 people are going to die in Atlanta from covid."
3370,Almost all of them could prevent this with two simple injections.
3371,"#covidroulette"" we would surely see some improvement, right?"
3372,What was your first vaccine and what booster did you get?
3373,And was it just essentially a whole dose?
3374,Personally I think that Biden decided on 8mo because if he said 6mo there would be millions of people “past due” already and there isn’t enough vaccine supply nor the staff to handle it.
3375,Our leadership has mismanaged this since for nearly two years and I’ve yet to see anything that makes me think we still won’t be fumbling along for the next year or two.
3376,You did your best by vaccinating.
3377,Grab a pulse oximeter just to be safe.
3378,Have a swift and uneventful recovery.
3379,"Also, avoid the horse paste."
3380,Sounds about right.
3381,I am a conservative and see things that make me very angry.
3382,I am fully vaccinated.
3383,"They are totally fine with losing jobs, places losing employees, just so they don't have to get the vaccine."
3384,Then they are the same ones bitching for months to tell people to go back to work.
3385,"Hey, f--- heads!"
3386,We are vaxxed and working!
3387,[removed]
3388,"98% asymptomatic or mild (not just asymptomatic)

3391,"We're way behind on both considering our wealth, and by making both unattainable to a significant percentage of the population, IDK why we're surprised that they would start to look for/trust alternative learning sources &amp; remedies."
3392,So me and my wife just got the second shot close to a month ago because we were trying to conceive.
3393,"Even though that is not an excuse, almost every single person in my life is vehemently against getting the Vax."
3394,"Almost every time I go to work my coworkers and boss would be talking about how every person getting the vaccine was getting sick, and stories about people they knew were left paralyzed after getting it."
3395,"Then my wife's parents who are a Nurses, have been telling us constantly not to get the Vax while we a trying to have kids."
3396,"We finally decided to do it in secret, but I guess what I'm trying to say is I can see where people get caught up in everything everyone around them is saying, instead of making the best decision for yourself."
3397,"Fuck, yeah."
3398,It's different state to state.
3399,Seems like they're trying to figure out when it's going to be most effective to start boosters I'd imagine.
3400,Oh I completely agree.
3401,I would never have a baby outside of a medical facility myself.

3407,"You’re not wrong, especially if it’s marketed as not mRNA."

3420,Yep.
3421,My cousin who is a nurse would not get the shot during her pregnancy.
3422,"I think it was more her husband, he wouldn’t let her take her anti-anxiety and depressions meds either… and still won’t while she is breastfeeding."
3423,Makes me so pissed.
3424,She is at least vaxxed now.
3425,But their kid could have been protected as well.
3426,Well that's what happens when you systematically destroy education and demonize the educated.
3427,"This is not only a garbage source, but also a changed title."
3428,Two rule violations in one.
3429,Three if you include the fact  opinion articles aren’t allowed.
3430,Four if you consider the changed title and/or the underlying “article” as clickbait.
3431,You’re on a roll OP.
3432,"&gt; Only comparing them to each other makes absolutely no sense  
  
Quite the opposite, comparing Sweden primarily to other Nordic countries makes the most sense."
3433,"&gt; Do you only compare Czechia to Slovakia, Hungary, and Poland?"
3434,There are similar countries in the Balkans + Austria and Germany.
3435,Sweden and Nordic countries are very different from all those countries.
3436,I've been thinking about this more and more.
3437,I think you're right.
3438,Yeah I'm definitely keeping an eye out for that.
3439,I got my final Pfizer shot near the end of March.
3440,So I'm hoping that they figure out something concrete sometime soon.
3441,"Man, I am on the fence with this."
3442,I can see both sides.
3443,"It would be nice to have milestones to hit and we could start backing off the mask wearing, however, I think that would quickly turn into hard dates where masking would stop."
3444,We still need to be able to have the flexibility to add mask mandates when necessary.
3445,"Overall, the messaging has not been great or consistent."
3446,"If the mask mandates wouldn’t have become politicized in the first place, all of this would be much easier."
3447,It's so much more important to get doses to people around the world who don't have access than it is to give people boosters
3448,[removed]
3449,&gt;The biggest issue is vaccine uptake.
3450,"Had everybody been vaccinated, Delta would just be a blip on the radar, but with all the anti-vaxxers in the hospital and the vaccinated people either not being infected or not nearly as sick, we need people to take the fucking shot so the hospitals aren't overwhelmed."
3451,"&gt;  
&gt;But NOOOOO people still want to doom about the very VERY few severe breakthrough cases and say we need to wear masks and social distance forever, even possibly lock down again."
3452,"Of course - same here, very happy to have *some* protection and hoping the boosters come out soon."
3453,Good luck!
3454,Just like our healthcare system compared to the rest of the civilized world.
3455,"Wow, that's awful."
3456,"I can't imagine having to just ""hope for the best and call if you run into problems"" when it comes to labor &amp; delivery."
3457,I woke up with it the first day of finals week my freshman year.
3458,I had to take a physics final while hallucinating from DayQuil.
3459,"great resource, thanks for posting"
3460,How do you “fact check” something that there isn’t consensus on though?
3461,"Just a year ago the lab leak theory was considered misinformation, now the government is saying it’s a possible theory."
3462,"Who decides what is factual and what is not, especially when the truth isn’t known?"
3463,That’s the issue with that idea.
3464,Every single person on the planet has a bias toward their viewpoint in one way or another.
3465,https://www.newscientist.com/article/2277145-cias-hunt-for-osama-bin-laden-fuelled-vaccine-hesitancy-in-pakistan/
3466,I feel like they're going to do the shots through pediatrician offices that have records on the kids.
3467,That's the best way imo.
3468,My kid turns 5 in November.
3469,I just made her appt for her 5 yr well check and I'm praying she can get her first shot then (she's been waiting a looooong time)
3470,Guess they might die then.
3471,Covid does not care
3472,"&gt;	That afternoon/evening, parents get a close contact exposure letter written in legalese that some of them cannot understand."
3473,"&gt;	The following day, anywhere between a quarter and half of the class is out because of the COVID scare."
3474,They will continue to be out for several days until they can get a test.
3475,"If any of them test positive, go back to Step One."
3476,At my kid’s school in Alabama the parents are literally told nothing when another student in class tests positive.
3477,The Alabama Department of Public Health made contact tracing optional and leaves it up to the school itself.
3478,Most aren’t even bothering.
3479,"I ask my kid every day at pickup for the rundown on who is absent, etc."
3480,because that’s the only way to get any info at all.
3481,"If anything Singapore is still in the ""zero covid"" camp indefinitely, and people are pissed that the government does not have any roadmap for easing restrictions"
3482,Amen
3483,They did that or they are currently doing that?
3484,Cuz their new deaths number is crashing right when it shouldn't.
3485,"At the end of the day it doesn't really matter much, because it would be arguing over underreporting tens of thousands of cases while the US numbers would have underreporting of tens of millions of cases due to the scale between their outbreaks."
3486,"My experience in the first 2 rounds of vaccines (wife/me, later my almost 12 yo)..."
3487,The folks giving the vaccines aren't paying too much attention to the bureaucratic rules.
3488,"If you have an arm, they have a shot."
3489,"The nurse giving my wife the shot basically begged me to get one, ahead of my technical place in line, because they were throwing away unused doses every week."
3490,"As soon as it's proven safe for kids, we'll find a shot somewhere for my 10yo"
3491,I am curious how much of that jump in vax numbers could be attributed to people getting their 3rd doses (either legitimately or falsifying information).
3492,I'm from rural NC and I think we both have bingo
3493,"Yeah, person who spreads it and those who facilitate."
3494,"In cases where anyone is injured as a result then there should be a charge like conspiracy to negligence, encouraging self harm or something like that."
3495,Or just call it manslaughter if it leads to death.
3496,Big if true.

3506,"To be clear, this thread has explained to me now that this damage isn't going to happen with the vaccine, because of how the vaccine mRNA can't bind to our cells."
3507,A quick search shows that the CDC is strongly recommending that those infected with covid should get vaccinated.
3508,Further searches found multiple research articles supporting this.
3509,So the doctor with the agenda is ignoring CDC recommendations and spinning his story by pretending his agenda has CDC support.

3521,That was the posters point.
3522,Women avoid putting LOTS of things into their bodies while pregnant to protect their unborn child that normally they would have.
3523,"The trials did not actively include pregnant women, and the CDC left the recommendation up to “women to decide with their doctors” which was a very tough spot to put these women."
3524,I feel like it's almost inevitable for everyone.
3525,"I'm on the fence with the ""proof"" argument."
3526,Leaning towards should be required.
3527,"When the CDC said masks are no longer required, and unvaxed should still mask via ""honor system"" it was and still is a mess 
By removing the passport,they basically threw hands in the air and are solely reliant on maximum vaccinated."
3528,"This and people who have been vaccinated in the earlier stages, will need boosters very soon"
3529,Fauci said as much last week I believe.
3530,I've definitely considered it.
3531,But I won't be surprised if administrators are more strict about requiring proof of age with the little ones - or even requiring that you go to the pediatrician to get the shot.
3532,"When I was pregnant, well before the pandemic, I had female family and friends (a few were pregnant at the time as well), questioning me on why I was getting Tdap and influenza vaccinations; they claimed to not have ever been told that they needed these vaccines and they had no intentions of getting vaccinated."
3533,"Not surprisingly, these are also the same people currently not being vaccinated for COVID."
3534,"When I went for my third COVID dose recently, I was happy to see a pregnant woman who was a walk-in getting her first COVID vaccination."
3535,Kinda weird that you use the same Constitution that originally didn’t recognize black people as human beings as some sort of beacon of justice

3552,"It’s much better than what it used to be though, everything used to smell like rotting garbage or something."
3553,Now only certain foods smell weird
3554,"74% of the total population in the state has at least 1 dose, 66% total population is fully vaccinated."
3555,Considering 0-12 still can't get it that's a pretty good rate among the eligible population.
3556,My aunt is *terrified* that this will happen to her unvaccinated son and DIL who have three young kids.
3557,"She's afraid of having to take care of the kids for any length of time if one or both parents get sick, let alone having to raise or help raise them if one or both of their parents should die."
3558,"I'm provax, but I doubt those were his last words."
3559,"If it were me, it would be something towards the kids."
3560,"But it does since that ""load"" of people will likely survive and gain immunity naturally - hence herd immunity."
3561,See above.
3562,Also Polio is hardly a fair comparison to Covid.
3563,If you catch this disease and are young enough and healthy you have over a 99.9% chance of surivial without any long lasting effects.
3564,Studies have shown that infection + vaccination is better at preventing reinfection than simply having been infected.
3565,Infection does provide something though.
3566,"&gt; breakthrough infections are now running 40% they say...

That was for people who had only received 1 or more doses in July."
3567,For the double dosed it will be less.
3568,"&gt; so spread is going to happen no matter what, even if everyone was vaccinated

But given that unvaccinated people spread more and contract more - it would obviously be an improvement to public health to keep them away."
3569,I quit CNA work because it pays almost minimum wage even with a pandemic.
3570,Then I saw in the news that nursing homes were evacuated because nobody showed up to work.
3571,The people who run nursing homes are hyper focused on getting cheap labor and even attempt to use volunteers off the street to help care for the residents.
3572,It is disgusting.
3573,and I'm not getting covid for nine dollars an hour and bringing it home to my kids.
3574,We’re all conditioned to panic about case numbers but I think there comes a point where that doesn’t tell the same story it did pre-vaccine.
3575,"Eliminating Covid was never going to happen but if these vaccines can turn it from a public health crisis into a head cold, that’s the finish line."
3576,"&gt;Some but not all restrictions:

All of these make sense for curbing spread inside the country."
3577,The travel restrictions should prevent new strains from arriving into Israel.
3578,I wish we had these travel restrictions here.
3579,"There's been like 10,000 of these news stories."
3580,"Problem is the denial people are cultists, they don't care about anything."

3601,What's sad is many Americans fail to realize other countries have this virus under control.
3602,"And Americans still scream about ""freedom"" when they have no idea what real persecution is."
3603,So this medical doctor's opinion is irrelevant because he is against lockdowns and vaccine mandates?
3604,I can think of at least one leader in the past year who really would have liked to declare a particular viewpoint as officially untrue.
3605,What about unvaccinated people that have previously had an infection?
3606,Previous asymptomatic infection?
3607,Previous mild infection?
3608,Previous severe infection?

Based on these *extremely* low rates of transmission, I have hope for this stage of the pandemic."
3633,Hopefully the end of the Delta wave ushers in the era of endemic Covid like some experts are predicting.

3649,I have the textbook.
3650,"Give it a try, you spend one hour listening to them and you will not regret it."
3651,He has a panel of other virologists as well as immunologists.
3652,I have about 500 journal articles in my pdf files but most of them are older.
3653,"I don't know what other commenter is talking about, with natural immunity is 6x greater."
3654,I haven't heard that.
3655,"Last episode they were talking about the natural immunity for people who got the original variant, which primes the system to create antibodies that can be used against different variants, while the vaccines haven't been able to do that so far, but they think that some months after vaccination, some of this type of flexibility will occur."
3656,"They also think that the vaccines would have worked better if they had more time in between them, i.e., they would be lasting longer, but with a raging pandemic they had to get 2 into people as quickly as possible."
3657,"This is why they think the booster will really boost the immunity a lot more, because it will be months after the last dose."
3658,"The natural immunity, they say, will wane also, and they think that will happen much quicker than the waning of the vaccines, unless someone had a severe infection."
3659,"They doubt that people who had very mild infections initially have very strong immuniy, especially if a lot of time has gone by."
3660,"So there are all kinds of other factors, and then there is immunity from T and B cells which is not measured by antibody tests."
3661,"They conclude for now that vaccines are much better than natural immunity because they are more of a known quantity, and even thouh they are wearing off, that waning when be greater in a natural infection."
3662,"And of course,they don't want to suggest that anyone just remain unvaccinated so they will get a natural infection."
3663,"People can't rely on having been infected last year, because they may have had a mild infection, and in any case that immunity would be wearing off by now."
3664,The whole subject is quite complex.
3665,And we know that the best thing is to get vaccinated.
3666,Kudos to those able to communicate effectively with these types of people.
3667,"I couldn't do it, my disgust and derision runs too deep because it's nearly incomprehensible to me, this inexplicable logic-breaking conviction they have that truly shows the worst instincts of humanity."

3679,"So only those tribes suffered greatly or died off, but the greater populace lived on."
3680,Now these morons have an audience by the millions and the cost is great.

3682,This mandate is a violation of amendment 10.
3683,It might be puberty related since they aren’t seeing it in teenage girls.
3684,In which case younger boys might be less at risk.

3750,Oxygen drops to 75 when he moves his arm.
3751,And has a pulmonary embolism still.
3752,This guy will have to re ahgod knows how long.
3753,He might come bs cc for a worse trombosis.
3754,I know he won't be able to be an electrician for awhile.
3755,So.. just personally experience.
3756,Six left our ICU in a bag.
3757,One left on a ventilator.
3758,One left off a ventilator.
3759,One left with a trach.

3766,Mid 2022 for 5-11?
3767,There’s absolutely nothing to indicate it’ll take that long.
3768,I know the paper your talking about.
3769,It's a preprint out of Israel.
3770,"The big problem is that they were looking at people who had COVID, survived, and chose not to get vaccinated."
3771,Definitely not a random sample.
3772,So the most vulnerable people will removed from the group (because they died).
3773,How much of the apparent immunity is attributable to that?
3774,The authors didn't attempt to estimate that.
3775,"Also the error bars were pretty big, 2-6x."
3776,"But of course everyone says ""6x."""
3777,"One more minor interpretation thing, is a 99.9% off coupon ""10x better"" then a 99% off coupon?"
3778,That's the kind of calculation that's used to come up with that stat.
3779,What the fuck are you talking about
3780,&gt; I can't seem to find the full text for this paper but I'll check the data base when I get to work tomorrow.
3781,Is [this](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.21.423721v2.full.pdf#page=5) what you're looking for?
3782,":

&gt; Production and purification of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S protein 

&gt; SARS-CoV-2 S protein was expressed in insect cells and purified as described previously."
3783,"(33, 34) 
Briefly, the S construct encoded amino acids 1 to 1213 (extracellular domain) fused with a thrombin 
cleavage site, followed by a T4-foldon trimerisation domain and a hexahistidine affinity purification 
tag at the C-terminus."
3784,"The polybasic furin cleavage site was mutated (RRAR to A) to increase the 
stability of the protein for in vitro studies."
3785,"(33, 34) S protein was expressed in Hi5 cells using the 
MultiBac system."
3786,"(35) Secreted S protein was harvested 3 days after infection by centrifuging the cell 
culture at 1,000g for 10 min followed by another centrifugation of supernatant at 5,000g for 30 min."
3787,"S 
protein-containing medium was incubated with HisPur Ni-NTA Superflow Agarose (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific) for 1h at 4ºC."
3788,"Resin bound with S protein was separated from unbound proteins and medium 
using a gravity flow column, followed by 30 column volume wash with wash buffer (65 mM NaH2PO4, 
300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, pH 7.5)."
3789,"Finally, the protein was eluted with a step gradient of elution 
buffer (65 mM NaH2PO4, 300mM NaCl, 235mM imidazole, pH 7.5)."
3790,"Eluted fractions were analysed 
by reducing SDS-PAGE."
3791,"Fractions containing the S protein were pooled and concentrated using 50 kDa 
MWCO Amicon centrifugal filter units (EMD Millipore)."
3792,"During concentration, proteins were buffer-
exchanged in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.5."
3793,"Concentrated protein was aliquoted, flash frozen 
in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80ºC until use."
3794,Thanks for weighing in.
3795,"My point is not that false positive PCR tests are common, I understand they are very rare."
3796,My point is it would be rare to have two false negative tests when you're symptomatic but the author never considers the possibility they just had the flu.
3797,"They won't take it because another political faction wants them to, and negative partisanship is a thing."
3798,They just won't admit it to everyone.
3799,Isn't that what endemic basically is?
3800,Like the common cold/flu.
3801,[removed]
3802,Wow!
3803,Probably they need to be very careful on dosages for smaller bodies and very different immune reactions in young children.
3804,The age distributions here can have drastically different reactions to medication.
3805,They can't just dose kids with an adult formulation.
3806,It's taking time because despite what the conspiracy wack jobs say... the government is trying to make sure vaccines are as safe as possible.
3807,[removed]
3808,I do it super lazy and the pounds fly off.
3809,I do intermittent fasting twice a week and bike 30 minutes a day.
3810,"I had to do something about cardio anyway as once I was having sex and my girlfriend was like"" Are you gonna cum or faint?"""
3811,I was getting winded just biking to the corner store.
3812,My job was a 15km bike ride and became 20 steps stroll to my home office.
3813,Add to that copious amounts of legal weed and takeout and there I was.
3814,Pertussis is commonly known as whooping cough.
3815,People with it really do make a whooping sound.
3816,"And yes, it used to kill many babies."
3817,"It is even used in one of the Anne of Green Gables books, where Anne is adult and is caring for a baby with whooping cough and is very scared the baby might die."
3818,So you are right: you do not want to get whooping cough -- to catch it yourself or give it to someone else.
3819,My mother had diphtheria in the 1930s.
3820,She nearly died.
3821,The crazy thing is that she survived because her mother (grandma I never got to meet)  had got life insurance on her kids.
3822,She informed the life insurance company and they sent a nurse to care for my sick mother.
3823,"Your mileage may vary, and your circumstances, but the only thing that got me out of my depression after my cat died was another cat."
3824,At the time the cat was 21 years old and I'd had her more than half my life.
3825,Got tested today for free thanks to the county I live in!

3827,It's already an endemic.
3828,We're not getting rid of COVID.
3829,I'm sure there will be a new variant a couple months from now as well.
3830,Also wanted to chime in that my husband and I are fully vaxxed and I got knocked up the first month trying.
3831,It is here to stay… but still go get a fucking vaccine like a responsible adult

3833,Hopefully there's no massive car wrecks in the area of that hospital.
3834,spider bites are nothing to fuck with.
3835,"I had a shop teacher who got bit by a tropical spider and he would break out in a rash each year around the bite location, probably the weirdesr thing ive seen or heard of with spiders."
3836,"he has no idea what spider it was, just that it was relatively large and came out of a crate of bananas."
3837,Big surprise.
3838,We also have the shittiest health insurance system as well.
3839,Fuck this garbage country.
3840,Ok that makes sense.
3841,I didn’t have any contact with a COVID positive person that I’m aware of.
3842,It was a very odd situation.

3856,I've wondered the same thing.
3857,"My understanding is that the ifr is under 1%, on the lower end for younger people."
3858,"The odds of this are astounding, and I've read other similar headlines."
3859,"I wonder if there are environmental factors, or if the ifr of this variant is higher?"
3860,I haven’t got the the flu shots since my bad experience a decade ago but since my Covid-19 jabs I’ve been considering it.
3861,[removed]
3862,In the absence of all other symptoms it's hard to just say that any one thing is covid and worth testing for.
3863,"If I show up with a headache they're not going to test me for covid, even if I have it the next day."
3864,But we know some people only get headaches.
3865,"But all in all there's a lot of reasons to have changes In BP, like A LOT."
3866,So I wouldn't just assume that covid is what it is
3867,"They are to blame, sure, but a lot of people go directly to US sites for all kinds of information."
3868,"So we can pass laws about our own media, but can't make it illegal to view American bullshit."
3869,"(Well, not without hitting Chinese levels of censorship.)"
3870,I know all the data is bs but I think I see where their flawed logic was.
3871,"They thought they were doing a relative risk equation 

RR=p1/p2 

but got the control group and exposed group the wrong way round."
3872,"They also assumed they had the figures for p1 and P2, but they actually needed to do the full equation 

         a/(a+b)
RR = -------------
         c/(c+d)

Which for many, many many reasons for they don't have the right data for."
3873,That study does not imply they are actually a vector for covid.
3874,In order to get it in the first placed they needed to be fed milk with covid in it which isn't exactly realistic.
3875,Thanks for these tips!
3876,will definitely try to swing by a store and get some Gatorade.
3877,She already took something similar to Tylenol so I hope she feels better.
3878,"&gt;The baby and other children, ages 7, 5, 3 and 2, are being cared for by their grandparents, according to the station."
3879,"&gt;The children are still asking for “mommy and daddy,” sister-in-law Terri Serey told KNBC."
3880,"His comment is literally perfect as an informal statement of the need to balance benefits and harms in preventive treatments, so many of which, although seeming intuitively helpful, have been shown countless times to do more harm than good to anyone except the people collecting the fees related to them."
3881,Care to back that up with a source..  you know a valid one?
3882,"I picture that voice in Trump's head: ""At this moment he knew he f up"" but in Ben Carson's voice"
3883,England would make that choice essentially because they don’t think children would need a vaccine.
3884,That’s a pretty big gamble.
3885,"From what I remember, the myocarditis was more likely to happen in later teenage boys, but even then it was still a rare instance."
3886,And the risk of heart issues from Covid is significantly worse.
3887,So you get the test that says if you have severe covid….
3888,Only if admitted with covid?
3889,"What’s next, a test that determines if you will have a heart attack that’s only used on people admitted for heart attacks?"
3890,Anything more then 2 is pushing it.
3891,5 is a freaking lot and that is coming from someone who IS 1 of 5.

3893,Keep on dropping the pounds.
3894,I’m at 31 right now but I’ve got a decent amount of muscle so that skews my numbers a bit.
3895,Alcohol fetal syndrome is very serious and no wonder that many women don't want their children to be affected by something that it preventable.
3896,"Moreover, we know that small doses are safe BUT  we don't now how much is safe and dosage based on trimester."
3897,There are no studies because they would not pass the ethics board.
3898,It's much safer for women to avoid alcohol when pregnant than risk going overboard because small is very subjective term.

3927,"We're seeing a somewhat similar picture (we won't likely reach a very high vaccination percentage, at least not for quite a while), but things are still definitely better than not having vaccines."
3928,Unvaccinated hospitalizations are disproportionately higher than vaccinated.
3929,I never said the intention was to make R0 below 1 forever.
3930,"With variants like delta, I'm not sure if that's even possible, because we would need a very high infection immunity, which doesn't seem to be the case as with current vaccines with delta, specially after neutralizing antibodies wane after a few months."
3931,"And unfortunately deaths will still happen, just like flu deaths happen and we have vaccine for it."
3932,"The point is, how many deaths is acceptable?"
3933,"For flu, we decided that the current deaths we have today, is ""acceptable""."
3934,"If the country lives in a democracy, that nation will vote what they represent and find the attitude acceptable."
3935,Not my intention to meddle on other country affairs btw.
3936,"I appreciate the thinking of some Asian and Australia/NZ thinking of getting less COVID as possible, not really complaining, just giving my view."
3937,I just hot jabbed 3 days ago than a 38 fever that lasted until this morning.
3938,I am 23 and i got Astrazeneca.
3939,Some of my relative had died 2 months ago so i decided to roll out as soon as possible and have to wait for a month to even get a vaccine.
3940,"Well, after i get the jab, i was informed of the possible rare blood clot side effect which i hadn't been told about."
3941,But some pointed out that the clot side effect is only happen to caucasian people to which i am not (i'm south east asian) and my countries has reported 0 (possibly 1) case out of maybe 20 million jabs.

3948,"I agree going to get a PCR test is a barrier, even if free, though the situation you describe is absolutely a situation in which one should get tested."

3976,Individual benefit of vaccine in young children is not clearly established.

3983,Vaccines to 80% will not keep the R0 below 1.
3984,The unvaccinated remaining in the UK are more than enough to overwhelm the hospitals.
3985,That's 13 million people remaining on top of the people who end up in ICU while fully vaccinated which is definitely still happening.
3986,"If your R0 is above 1, you're going to have problems, the only reason you've had ends to the earlier waves were other restrictions being implemented."

4001,"I don't love him, but this recall is a ridiculous dog and pony show that's costing $276m  dollars to replace a guy who is literally up for re-election in a year."
4002,The frontrunner to replace him is every R talking point (on the pandemic and otherwise) rolled into one.
4003,"I am not a healthcare professional so I can't speak to OP's comment about quitting, but I can understand the general frustration that any gains we've made (and we are doing better on the covid front) could be instantly undone with Larry Elder as the governor, even for just the remaining year or so of the term that he is 'running' to replace Newsom for."
4004,"Elder has campaigned on actively undoing mask mandates, vaccine progress, and any common sense covid restrictions."
4005,LA's current spike began slowly trending down when the mask mandate was reinstated.
4006,We're getting there.
4007,"We saw how bad it was when we jumped the gun last year, and even the rising vax numbers couldn't hold off Delta enough to keep us from spiking again when we removed the masks."
4008,"I'm not suggesting anything close to a lockdown, nor do I think that would work."
4009,All I want is a governor not actively working against the progress that has been made.
4010,"Again, I don't love Newsom and would be the first to vote against him in next summer's primary in favor of a good challenger."
4011,But that's just it.
4012,The election to replace him legitimately is so close.
4013,I'd rather punish him then than fuck up any progress we've made with Covid and a bunch of other things.
4014,At best the recall is an unnecessary distraction.
4015,"At worst, if it succeeds, it could do serious damage that kills more people"
4016,are they overwhelming the hospitals?
4017,I doubt it.

4059,Zenni was a total game changer for me.
4060,Wonderful option!
4061,It’s not really masks here.
4062,It’s vaccines.
4063,The SFBA is INCREDIBLY vaccinated.
4064,"Masks help, but they’re not the primary variable."
4065,I said a little prayer for your young one to hopefully not get sick or get immunity without any problems.
4066,Maybe now our nation of temporarily embarrassed millionaires will finally try to keep up with the jones's.
4067,Lifestyles of the rich and famous.
4068,"Get on it, America."
4069,Get vaxxed.
4070,Show them how much vaccine you can use.
4071,My sincerest hopes and prayers for him.
4072,I wish him a speedy and full recovery.
4073,"They fed them milk in the test, but it's not required."
4074,For example when they studied the covid infections at European mink farms they found covid in the flies.
4075,Nobody had been feeding covid milk to those flies.
4076,"It's hard to imagine how a fly would get virus from milk but not, for example, from the spit and mucus coughed up by an infected person."
4077,I just ate somewhere and they didn’t seem terribly interested in my vaccine card.
4078,Inner Richmond.
4079,Are you offering to help out?
4080,Same here in Alberta
4081,Definitely not?
4082,Vaccination reduces the severity of cases.
4083,"So yes, people will get infected, the virus will be endemic."
4084,"But *majority* won't be hospitalized, because.... you know, you were vaccinated, because well, the vaccine works."
4085,You can see this from UK already.
4086,You had a cases wave almost as bad as wave in december/january.
4087,But deaths?
4088,90% less deaths than previous wave.
4089,"And UK completely vaccinated only 65% of total population, while Singapore 79%."
4090,"UK also has 18% of population older than 65+, while Singapore has 10%."
4091,"So if UK manage to vaccinate more people (specially young ones, to reduce transmission), and probably a booster for +80, the numbers likely will be better."
4092,copy that.
4093,could be.
4094,i once suffered with costochondritis for over a year until finally getting steroid shots into the cartilage of my ribcage which fixed the problem for me.
4095,was painful to undergo but chronic pain is moreso.
4096,u/limitin hope you get to feeling better soon
4097,"MRNA vaccine immunity is targeted, like a lock and key."
4098,"Natural immunity relies on antibodies finding some random part of the virus to attack, so instead of the precision you get a shotgun blast to knock out the virus and anything near it."

4125,Essentially you find an existing social crack (think crazy anti-vaxers from 10 years ago....
4126,They existed but were very much on the fringe).
4127,"Then you embolden them ""probably"" without their knowledge in most cases... stroke the ego, make fake accounts, spread more bullshit... Get debates roiling on forums/etc."

4139,Were they anti-vax?

4142,"If your vaccination rate is at 80%, and your R0 is still above 1, it doesn't matter if you only have 7 ICU cases today, you're going to have 1000 in a couple of months because that's how this works."

4146,The minister has already said they are discussing what the threshold for opening would be.
4147,"As in, how many critical cases and deaths would Singapore accept to open."
4148,"It isn't a decision to make lightly, but everyone wants to make it without any consideration."
4149,"A lot of people just want to open up so they can go to the pub, and not care who has to die for them to do that."
4150,Any idea what variant?
4151,Is there such a thing?
4152,"I keep saying, if you are vaccinated you are probably going to get it."
4153,"If you are unvaccinated, you are definitely going to get it."
4154,I work in a small business.
4155,Almost everyone is vaccinated.
4156,One person is definitely not.
4157,Guess who got it three weeks ago?
4158,"He's fine, thank God."
4159,But it was a little bit of hell covering him for the time he needed to get better.
4160,We got through it.
4161,He and his family are ok. And we are grateful for that.
4162,I would love to see America's statistics on that.
4163,Worth to point out that with polio we have a mix of different vaccine tech as well (inactivated + attenuated).
4164,I could see this happening with COVID as well.
4165,"A mix of tech + different strains, as we saw good numbers with Viral Vector+mRNA."
4166,"Visited Birmingham UK, and got handed a pack of 7 in the street by the track and trace teams."

4171,"First I've heard of this, what's it called?"
4172,Do you send them off or does it show at home?
4173,"You're right

The key you pointed out is you, I or your docs know we aren't researchers or know more than CDC &amp; FDA."
4174,I'm pretty surprised at this.
4175,Just last week my spouse had a concern and I'd posted in r/Vancouver looking for options (other than the government testing site) and no options available.
4176,I can't see anything on any drugstore chain's site - what's the test called?
4177,You can actually purchase and bring it home to use when needed?
4178,This is exactly how the healthcare workers feel.
4179,**The U.S. is falling to the lowest vaccination rates of the world’s wealthiest democracies.
4180,"**

Japan initially struggled to get its Covid-19 vaccination program into full gear, but now that it has, the percentage of its population that has received at least one dose has edged past the level achieved in the United States — leaving Americans last for that category among the world’s seven wealthiest large democracies."
4181,"The turning point came on Thursday, when Our World in Data, a project by the University of Oxford in England, reported that 62.16 percent of Japanese people were at least partially vaccinated, compared to 61.94 percent of Americans."
4182,"For the moment, the United States retains a slightly larger percentage of fully vaccinated people than Japan, 52.76 percent compared to 50.04 percent, according to Our World in Data, ranking sixth out of the Group of 7 nations, after Britain, Canada, France, Germany, and Italy."
4183,"But the United States appears all but certain to fall to last place among the Group of 7 nations shortly, given the rapid pace of achieving full vaccinations in Japan and the extremely slow rate in the United States."
4184,"Between July 24 and Sept. 9, the full vaccination rate in the United States grew by around 4 percent, while in the same period Japan lifted its level by 25 percent, a jump that doubled the size of its fully vaccinated population."
4185,"Using doses made by Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca, Japan is administering more than a million vaccine doses per day, some 300,000 above the U.S. average, even though the U.S. population is more than 2.6 times the size of Japan’s."
4186,"In Japan, new cases have fallen sharply from a peak of 23,083 on Aug. 25 to 11,347 on Friday, though Japan did confront a dramatic rise in new cases in July and August, coinciding with the Olympics."
4187,"In the United States, cases spiked starting in early July."
4188,"Canada leads the G7 countries in vaccination rates, with almost three-quarters of its population at least partially vaccinated as of Thursday, according to Our World in Data."
4189,"France, Italy and Britain follow, with percentages between 70 and 73."
4190,"Germany’s rate is just ahead of Japan’s, at around 65 percent."
4191,"The U.S. vaccination curve has leveled dramatically since an initial surge in the first half of this year, when the vaccine first became widely available."
4192,"In a push to vaccinate the roughly 80 million Americans who are eligible for shots but have not gotten them, President Biden on Thursday mandated that two-thirds of American workers, including health care workers and the vast majority of federal employees, be vaccinated against the coronavirus."

4200,I honest to fucking God don't understand these kind of articles.
4201,The answer is always: It's capitalism.
4202,They ask that much because they can.
4203,Could be the more dangerous one long term.
4204,"I appreciate the comment, thank you."
4205,Yeah it's just a risk/reward kind of thing.
4206,"Someone commented, and then deleted, about how my son would barely know he was in Disney."
4207,"This is very true, but we'd know he was in Disney (and my wife and I are those annoying Disney obsessed millennials) We'd have those pictures and memories forever."
4208,The plan would be fly to Cali &gt; hang with SIL &gt; do Disney &gt; fly home next day &gt; quarentine until we can test and feel it's accurate.

4211,I mean it depends on where you live.
4212,"In the UK, children above 12 or so can consent to medical treatment, as can their parents, so clinical trials have to show informed consent of both child and parents."
4213,right keep hearing how teachers dying becuase kids and teachers are unvaccinated.
4214,They do have a larger per capita population of elderly people who are also often quite poor.
4215,"&gt; If your vaccination rate is at 80%, and your R0 is still above 1, it doesn't matter if you only have 7 ICU cases today, you're going to have 1000 in a couple of months because that's how this works."

4223,"For me, I totally concur with that extremely accurate statement."
4224,My brother is like this.
4225,He believes the fatality counts are some combination of overstated and focused only on people that are elderly and sick.
4226,And that young and healthy people are at very little risk.
4227,There is an element of truth to this but he takes it a little too far.
4228,As unbelievable as it may seem there are some that honestly believe it is all a big hoax and misinformation campaign.
4229,Ridiculously they blame the Democrats even though it is a global issue.

4251,I should have been more careful with my words.
4252,Inconvenience is different than inequity.
4253,"ANY person who is not vaccinated is going to be in a bad spot now because of things like the OSHA regs or travel regulations, regardless of why they are not vaccinated."
4254,The only people experiencing true inequity right now are those who can not get vaccinated.
4255,Any person over 12 and medically able is equally and freely given vaccines which provides more equity.
4256,At some point people have to choose equity as well.
4257,"Meanwhile… antimasker, antivaxxer Covid deniers act like children throwing temper tantrums."
4258,A minority faction of ignorant anti-social humans who refuse to vaccinate and wear masks are 100 percent responsible for prolonging the pandemic and incubating new and worse strains.
4259,Mandatory vaccinations and masking is the only answer.
4260,Thx for your response.
4261,I will call my doctor or go straight to ER if i have severe side effect.
4262,"I sometimes have a panic attack / anxiety and my blood pressure and heart rate increased, sometimes even a headache and its been more severe since covid while my GP just say to get over it."
4263,"Vaccinated people can spread the virus if they get infected, which is a breakthrough infection, which is something like 1 in 10,000."
4264,I don't know why they are not more clear about this guidance.
4265,I would not worry.
4266,Yes but people on here were disputing your interpretation of them.
4267,And the AAP has different numbers that are much easier to interpret.
4268,I think that some of your posts were deleted by moderators speaks for itself.
4269,I’m finished here.
4270,Are they vaccinated?
4271,Are you?
4272,"If so, I would not worry."
4273,I've seen my 80-something in-laws about 5 times since we were all vaccinated.
4274,Kids are at infinitesimal risk from getting sick and if they are in any kind of day care or preschool situation they'll probably be exposed there anyway.
4275,She got through 2020.
4276,But I had to put her down in June this year.
4277,Miss her a lot.
4278,I could literally have written this message.

4286,I would go and not worry.
4287,"Statistically your 2 year old is at infinitesimal risk for getting sick, and so are you now that you're vaccinated."
4288,I'd be cautious about doing this and then like being around unvaccinated grandparents or something.
4289,"Note that in some areas, they are not even recommending vaccinating kids because the risk is so low and the benefit from the vaccine is so low."
4290,UK recently decided this for age 12-15.

4292,"My wife had serious side effects from J&amp;J including a high fever, side effects lasted about 36 hours on the button and then abruptly subsided."

4298,I mean it’s pretty free in NYC.
4299,I’ve been getting covid tested on average about twice a month since last august.
4300,And I’ve paid 0 dollars since then as all covid tests are covered in full by my insurance company.
4301,Isn’t this true around the US that your insurance must cover covid testing in full?
4302,Here is an article about how delta affects kids.
4303,https://www.smh.com.au/national/how-does-the-delta-variant-of-covid-19-affect-children-20210826-p58m1i.html
4304,The data has been trending this way for about a week.
4305,I think this is what approaching herd immunity looks like... declining waves of breakouts.
4306,And it makes sense.
4307,Don't forget that waves of cases leave behind immunity.
4308,Definitely not the preferred option for spreading immunity but it does happen.
4309,And for every reported case there are 4-5 others.
4310,"Florida gets a bad rap (deservedly so) but actually has above average vaccination rates, 65%, about 18th among US states."
4311,"That plus the lax policies, schools open, etc must mean that a large majority of the population is immune."
4312,Covid passes (which includes negative test) aren't going to work when we only have 60% vaccination coverage in young people.
4313,I don't know why we're allowing unvaccinated people to use the pass when breakthrough infections are pretty much guaranteed with delta.
4314,...Is it me or does this headline make a clinical trial of a Covid-19 vaccine on children sound more menacing than it really is?
4315,How resistant is Delta?
4316,"The gyn where my wife was in her first pregnancy checked all sorts of boxes in her maternal pass, just so he can freely use/do several diagnosis things regularly that he could charge the health insurance (Germany, private insurance)."
4317,He never even told us he checked these boxes and behaved as if this amount of testing were normal.
4318,"Ofc we found out and never went back to him, but stuff like that is sadly pretty common."
4319,Beat me to it.

4322,"They are in fact, because of the way the test is conducted, very uncommon."
4323,It searches for two parts of the viral rna and both have to be found.
4324,"If, for example, there is a false positive chance for both of 1%, than the odds of a false positive test would be 0.01*0.01 = 0.0001, which is almost nothing."
4325,On the other hand you would need a high viral load for a positive antigen test.
4326,"The blood clot risk is more like 0.001%, not 1%, and now that doctors know how to recognize it, it is rarely fatal."
4327,If you're worried about it call your doctor but it's an infinitesimal risk.
4328,"&gt;I understand it creates inequity right now

So you’re okay with providing inequity to Black Americans because… why again?"
4329,[deleted]
4330,As an atheist I think this might actually end up being a good thing
4331,I say you only report one.
4332,Both numbers are important.
4333,Two doses tells you people who are already vaccinated and one doses tells you people who will likely be vaccinated in 3 weeks(depending on amount of time that country leaves between doses).
4334,One dose still tells you who's on board with vaccination.
4335,Because selfish people cheat on the test results?
4336,Don't vaccines just come in a vial?
4337,"Pfizer is 0.3ml and AZ is 0.5 ml in terms of dosing -- I don't think those need different needles, why would they?"
4338,"Needle size should ideally be selected to ft the patient, depending on their BMI, because an intramuscular injection needs to go through the layer of fat to get to the muscle."
4339,"When I got vaccinated with Pfizer, I specifically asked about what type of needle they were using and why it was different from my second shot vs the first."
4340,The nurse said they had run out of the first type of needle.
4341,"I don't think there was a needle that came with the vaccine, I think they were just using whatever needles made logical sense."
4342,"Ah, ok, thank you for the info."
4343,"That's actually quite reassuring for my own plans, although I wonder about whether the government will pull back and create large restrictions again when (and if) the virus ends up spreading quite a bit more after travel opens back up."
4344,I can't imagine that after all of this amazing prevention they wouldn't implement more lockdowns for a time if there ends up being a large outbreak.
4345,Looks like we need Boosters too
4346,"As a person who lived and worked in the projects in the South Bronx and Harlem for over a decade, I understand that it creates inequity right now, and I understand that Black Americans have good reason to be suspicious and deny the vaccine."
4347,Most people in my religion are also not vaccinated as well.
4348,"There is horrifying inequity, but we're at a point where everyone needs to walk in to their local Duane Reade where they can protect themselves, their families and their community for free."
4349,"I don't believe that it matters whether it's a concert, air travel, a school or even a restaurant...people need to recognize that if they are not vaccinated, they will eventually get Covid and will likely give Covid to others."
4350,I've heard that the 2-5 age group could be authorized a few weeks after the 5-11 age group.
4351,So I've got my fingers crossed for November.
4352,"This is a good point and I really wish the level of testing was reported along with the cases because clearly the more testing you do the more cases you find, and vice versa."
4353,And people who self-select i.e.
4354,volunteer for testing are probably doing so based on what they see in the news.
4355,So testing leads to cases which leads to more testing.
4356,The article is originally by PTI.
4357,"They are the Indian Reuters

I would have preferred using a major media source like India Today or ToI but they are all banned"
4358,No country is completely capitalist or completely socialist.
4359,The best functioning countries are the ones with a correct balance of the two with regulations in place on corporations that ensure a high quality of life for their citizens.
4360,America just has the balance way off-kilter.

4370,"This is actually fantastic news, as schools open, the kids will get exposed, most likely become immune, and we'll make another huge stride towards herd immunity."

4379,That’s how pandemics are resolved.
4380,"Everyone susceptible dies, just slightly faster than they can procreate, until the human race has thinned the susceptible over the course of a few dozen generations."
4381,"Covid just uniquely has the ability to mutate rapidly, and to overwhelm modern civilization healthcare systems without distancing and masks."
4382,[removed]
4383,"Ah, the baktun method, make up a prediction that's far enough in the future that it won't be proven wrong in your lifetime, then reap the benefits."
4384,Sounds like long Covid sufferers need to start vaping in order to up-regulate their Ace2 receptors.
4385,LOL.
4386,mRNA vaccines are not nearly as new as people think.
4387,One of the first mRNA vaccines was a Zika vaccine that started phase 1 human trials in 2016 and got fast tracked for approval in 2019. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7349928/ there has been no reports of long term effects.
4388,"Admittedly it's a small study with only 90 volunteers, but that's normal for Phase 1."
4389,"It's a misconception that vaccines need to be tested for years for long-term effects - there are no recorded cases of any vaccine ever causing delayed effects that aren't apparent within the first few months after vaccination, nor is there any plausible mechanism for how they could possibly do that."
4390,"mRNA vaccines are not that different, and we do have the Zika trial from 5 years ago."
4391,"The reason vaccine trials normally take longer is simply because you have to wait for enough people in the control group to be infected before you assess trial results, and under non-pandemic conditions that takes quite a bit longer."
4392,Ebola trials took 10 years because there just weren't many infections during those years.
4393,"I mean, nobody is saying they are evil, just selfish."
4394,Also it's more like 25% of the population.
4395,And it's largely regional.
4396,"Which is why it's slamming their hospitals, not the vaccinated communities."
4397,I think it's odd that people are literally dying of gallstones down South because the hospitals are completely collapsing and you think it's all just gravy.
4398,Just read an article of a 4 year old that dyed because their mother brought it home and regrets not getting vaccinated.
4399,"Or the parents of 7 children, both unvaccinated, dead, so all are orphans."
4400,"You can pretend all you want they are just statistics, but a part of the Country wants to move on."
4401,And they ran out of staffed beds down South.
4402,In Idaho they are rationing care.

Results:
People who were vaccinated between December 2020 and March 2021 reported decreased mental distress levels in the surveys conducted after receiving the first dose."
4420,"The fixed-effects estimates show an average effect of receiving the vaccine equivalent to 4% of the standard deviation of PHQ-4 scores (p-value&lt;0.01), a reduction in 1 percentage point (4% reduction from the baseline level) in the probability of being at least mildly depressed, and of 0.7 percentage points (15% reduction from the baseline level) in the probability of being severely depressed (p-value = 0.06)."

4434,"&gt;I don’t know which numbers are correct

The numbers I provided all came directly from the CDC."
4435,They're also kinda expansive here in Brazil.
4436,"They go fo about R$100,00, which would be U$20,00."
4437,"Our economy is super fucked though, the dollar is very expansive, so these conversions don't really translate their cost here."
4438,"It's not super expansive, but not cheap at all."
4439,So anti-lockdown.
4440,And also anti- the measures that reduce the need for lockdowns like vaccine passports.
4441,Yet why are mask mandates not also removed then?

4446,"I don't know which numbers are correct, but I do know that the American Academy of Pediatrics would appear to be a pretty reliable source for this sort of information."
4447,My response to patients lately with the “we don’t know the long-term side effects”: I’d like you to live long enough to find out if there are any.
4448,Doesn’t work on everyone but I’ve had some success.
4449,"Weirdly, I wish i could explain it, Vermont has  26 cases per 100,000 which is pretty high considering their unbelievably great vaccination rate"
4450,Constructive dismissal would likely entitle you to severance pay as well.
4451,"No, under 5yo is a month behind, so Nov time frame, per NYT."
4452,"Don’t listen to Gottlieb, he flip flops so bad."
4453,"Well, one reason/example comes to mind:

As of August 13, 2021, only about 28% of Black Americans in NYC between the ages of 18-44 are vaccinated."
4454,That would mean 72% of Black Americans in NYC would be denied the service of air travel.
4455,"With this in mind, are you supportive of vaccine requirements for air travel?"
4456,"  
Vaccines reduce serious illness and death by a factor 10."
4457,"Vaccines reduce spread significantly 

Vaccines reduce the doubling rate  significantly 

If you have 80% of your population either vaccinated or an extremely low risk cohort (children),  hospitalizations will be higher than they usually are but it won't be the disastrous scenario it is with a largely unvaccinated population."
4458,You need to wait about 3 weeks at minimum but there’s no maximum time.
4459,You can get your second shot.
4460,"First one, the vaccine doesn’t stick around in the body long term, it gets filtered and leaves the body."
4461,"So there’s not continued exposure, if it did, we didn’t need to have a second or booster shot."
4462,I had quite intense chest pains starting 2 days after the first Pfizer shot.
4463,Required an ER visit on day 10 as the pain spread to my neck and back.
4464,"ECG, ultrasound, x-ray and bloods (troponin) came back normal."
4465,"No medical history, fit, 34, male, not on any meds."
4466,"It's now day 15, and while it's improved I still get random heart zaps, can't do weights/run and need to take ibuprofen every day to ease chest discomfort which gets worse at night."
4467,"I'm in Australia and here the current reported rate for suspected myocarditis is 1 in 29,000 doses: https://www.tga.gov.au/covid-19-vaccine-safety-monitoring-and-reporting

Anyway, this spike protein topic is of huge interest to me as I now need to decide whether to risk catching covid at half-vax, or risk rolling the dice yet again on these side effects with the 2nd dose."
4468,Is there any way I can confirm/reassure myself that the vaccine side effect was purely over-active immune response and not something that caused cardiovascular damage?
4469,The most effective anti inflammation drug is cannabis.
4470,I recommend 50:50 THC:CBD.
4471,There's also a particular strain called Charlotte's web CBD with no THC that was designed for epilepsy they might work pretty well.
4472,"I know it's not ivermectin with a corrupt drug company blatantly lying to the public through social media channels, but I've got a medical condition that creates tons of inflammation myself."
4473,Without cannabis I'd be actually dead.
4474,Cannabis is the only thing that does the job for me.

4547,If you don't believe the US hoarded more vaccines than they needed early on then I think you should go back and look at the early days of the rollout.
4548,US was one of the only countries on the planet where you could just walk into places without an appointment and get a vaccine.
4549,Other countries are often on months long waiting lists just to get one.
4550,The delivery rate curve was a big part of this.
4551,60-somethings in many developed countries couldn't get vaccine appointments until this month.
4552,US was vaccinating 30-somethings in February and March in many places.

4631,My wife did hospital nursing the first 2-3 years out of nursing school and she learned a lot but she burned out from the stress of the system.

4656,"My niece has one side of her family feeding her misinformation about how the vaccine makes you sterile, so now she won't get vaccinated because she wants to have kids."

4672,"Their concerns about vaccine mandates for social activities, and employment reasons also helped get them over their stubbornness."
4673,How accurate are rapid tests?
4674,A guy I'm seeing came down with cold like symptoms a few days ago but was feeling better today so he got a rapid covid test and tested negative.
4675,So we hung out outside today and he wore a mask most of the time.
4676,I would pull up my mask if he got close to me.
4677,We're both fully vaccinated.

4728,Just be some crazy coincidence then huh 🙄
4729,"Agreed, but as far back as April the president of the southern Baptist church told people to get vaccinated."
4730,Apparently many of the preachers are as well.
4731,"This isn't coming from the church in a large majority of the cases, they are just using it as an excuse because claiming religious freedom is a get - out - of - jail - free card."
4732,"I think the LDS was the last major religion to recommend it, but even they are now."

4740,For comparison I have a dear friend who was a pregnant nurse during covid.
4741,She declined the shot while pregnant but isolated from almost everyone.
4742,She got her first dose when the baby was about a month old and is now fully vaccinated.

4769,Delta arrived recently in S. America but it's gathering steam.
4770,Let's see in a couple of months how things stand.
4771,I wonder why people are worried about that.
4772,"If at this point, you're unvaccinated and you get sick and die, that shit is on you."
4773,"Good riddanc bro, nice knowing ya."
4774,"But if you're vaccinated, the unvaccinated are not a threat to you, only to themselves."
4775,So why worry?
4776,The only thing that still needs some tinkering is the way hospitals deal with them.
4777,"They need to resume normal operations and install a triage, in which unvaccinated Covid-patients are de-prioritized behind every other emergency requiring intensive care."
4778,Just let them die and move on with your life.
4779,I think you’re underestimating the scale of your ask.
4780,FB pours literal billions into this problem and hasn’t been able to solve it.
4781,"Even for seemingly simple things like recognizing abuse and porn, the volume of submissions is so high that an algorithm that catches 99.99% of all issues will still let thousands of false negatives through."
4782,FB is the poster child because of their scale.
4783,Reddit is a perfect example of a company without the resources of an FB but a similar scale problem.
4784,Your ask would likely bankrupt social media as we know it.
4785,Whether or not that’s a good thing is a different debate but just pointing out this isn’t a trivial thing.
4786,If you can solve it the tech companies would rocket you up Forbes list.
4787,I think it does cause the same response.
4788,It's similar to how people can get blood clots after getting the vaccines.
4789,The reason why most people don't get blood clots is that the vaccine is administered by an intramuscular injection.
4790,The vaccine stays in your muscle so the immune response is localized to the site of injection.
4791,"However, the vaccine ""leaks"" a bit outside of the muscle for a small number of people, causing blood clots."
4792,"AZ and J&amp;J vaccine and the needles they come with, in particular, appear to be more prone to ""leaking"" than Pfizer and Moderna ones."
4793,This all suggest that it's important to avoid being exposed to the virus even if your are vaccinated.
4794,You don't want an immune response in your whole body.
4795,South Africa.

4807,I quite literally just talked about a study from the cdc website showing data from 13 states over the summer.
4808,I linked it right at the top of the comment.
4809,"The initial vaccine efficacy data was pre-delta, the data I linked includes some time when delta was dominant."
4810,Feel free to link your sources if you think they contribute to the discussion.
4811,"I completely agree that masks are effective, but I see 1 N95 mask out of hundreds of ill-fitting cloth masks."
4812,"We've pushed this mask narrative so much that people will occasionally do the bare minimum of wearing a never-washed cloth mask, and that's it."
4813,That to me is theater.
4814,"Someone smarter than me answered this in another thread: https://reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/pmszpf/_/hclfnio/?context=1

Cliff notes: the spike protein in covid (not antibodies) is what binds to cells lining small blood vessels and causes inflammation."

4826,"This is one thing I have looked deeper into; when someone dies, and had covid months before but “recovered,” and they die of a heart attack, embolism, pneumonia, it’s definitely not marked as a covid death right?"
4827,I understand I can go look up excess deaths for each mortality cause and refine the estimates in my head.
4828,But could it already be 1 million due to covid technically?
4829,"Not because hospitals were full, but because covid caused some ripples even after “recovery,” to some people."
4830,"If for example, things we’ll likely never know, x amount of deaths that weren’t going to happen due to heart attack, or stroke, or embolisms, or any other cause of mortality, but did because covid caused it down the line."
4831,What could that number possibly be?
4832,Probably will never find out.
4833,"I’ve always had a fear from the beginning of longer term issues, or stuff after “recovery,” and it didn’t help that a friend, who’s healthy, an athlete, in his early 30s, was double vaxxed, has no family history of heart problems, had a minor heart attack recently some time after a covid infection."
4834,"Like, I’m not sure if something like this will ever be, or if it even was attributed/due to covid, but it’s a little worrisome…"

4836,Good luck man… really hope you guys pull this through!

4856,Heck even getting food from vendors feels like we are dealing drugs since we need to be discrete at night because of curfew.
4857,Sort of.

4865,Too bad they were on the landing strip at the time
4866,7 cases the amount we had since there where 30-100 cases daily.

Out of 46k vaccinated cases, there were 3k hospitalized

These numbers are from the period while delta was ramping up it's prevalence."
4916,It's probably actually worse than that in a mostly delta scenario like what the UK is experiencing.
4917,"The interesting thing is that what you're saying about reduced hospitalization for vaccinated persons isn't shown in these numbers, in both vaccinated and unvaccinated about 6% of people with a confirmed COVID case are hospitalized."
4918,"Obviously far less cases in the vaccinated people, but they're still catching it quite regularly."
4919,"In the UK, 6% of the unvaccinated (at 80% Vaccination) means 6% of 13 million, or just shy of 800k people unvaccinated will be hospitalized."

4921,"Even if you assume only 10% of vaccinated people catch it, that's another 100k or so fully vaccinated people ending up in hospital."
4922,"You've already had about 500k people hospitalized for COVID over the last year and a half, which has stressed the system significantly and cancelled lots of routine medical work."

4983,Typically after 20 weeks the stresses on the women's body increases (although the first 12 weeks nausea can be very intense) with changes in the mother's body as it supports a larger and larger fetus.
4984,Maternal death is skyrocketing as well.
4985,While viability increases every week it's possible a fetus can live outside it's mother sometime around 24 weeks.
4986,"Most fetal deaths are able to be diagnosed,  miscarriage however is often not diagnosed as it's sometimes spontaneous, and it's so damn common they won't even investigate why you miscarry unless you have 3 or more."
4987,"Either way, covid outcomes are far worse than possible complications being vaccinated for the baby and mother."

4995,"For colleges it is clear, though—or at least it should be."
4996,The vaccines pretty much take death of the table for everyone who goes to or works at the University.
4997,They dramatically reduce the odds of hospitalization.
4998,"Right now, masks are necessary, in part to protect those with young children at home."
4999,That will no longer be true soon.
5000,So what’s  the justification for going online?
5001,Trying to get cases to zero?
5002,That’s never going to happen and not a rational goal.
5003,"As a final comment, competitive schools will absolutely not be able to do this."
5004,"Their students and alumni won’t accept it, especially while other schools are fully in person—which they will be."
5005,"There’s no way Yale goes remote, for example."
5006,"They have a mask and vaccine mandate, and they test everyone weekly."
5007,That plan will work.
5008,"Other schools are going to be forced to put in some effort and figure out a way to make things work, or it will do real harm to their reputations."
5009,No worries :)
5010,How about masks?
5011,Every authority figure and newspaper in march 2020 was going on about how n95 masks don't work if you aren't trained to use them.
5012,"There's also the big fiasco where it took forever for anyone to admit that covid was airborne despite ample examples of it traveling through ventilation or across restaurants, etc."
5013,And enough people believed them that the damage has arguably been done permanently.
5014,And that's understating the problem.
5015,"If governments have the right to decide what is or is not publishable misinformation, the problem gets even worse."
5016,"Because now that disagreeing with the government about a matter of public health is criminal, people have little reason to research the alternatives."
5017,"They're not going to get published, not going to get funding, and nobody is going to hear what they have to say."
5018,So it'll take even longer to arrive at the truth than it does now.
5019,"I prefer the status quo even if it means I've got to deal with half a country of fools trying to ruin things for the rest of us, because if there were just a few more of them than they'd be in charge and they'd be the ones deciding what gets censored."
5020,RemindMe!

5032,Thanks for not being one of those people.

5034,I thought my state didn't allow for under 10.
5035,Can it possibly differ state by state?
5036,Because it would be great if she can get her flu shot when I get mine.
5037,"And even better for the covid vaccine, it's like hell trying to make an appt at her pedi's office for a well appt."
5038,LOL.
5039,"If 7 person in ICU is not enough to back to normal, I don't know what will be enough, really..."
5040,Heart inflammation for teenage boys?
5041,I've read about heart inflammation this morning being a side effect of getting covid but this is the first I'm hearing about it being more prevelent in teenage boys
5042,[deleted]
5043,"Well, there is always the possibility this becomes an endemic."
5044,That made my head spin just skimming it.
5045,These poor kids being used as pawns.
5046,These people at the school meetings should have to prove they live in the district of not also that they have kids at the school.
5047,It’s a problem all over that is totally out of hand .
5048,Or you could read the study yourself and stop being lazy.
5049,Me spoon feeding you my thought is not going to go anywhere since you clearly have a large bias.
5050,"Have a good day, oh hint hinge is gross."
5051,I hope you have a mild case.
5052,Look into the possibility of getting Regeneron treatment.
5053,"In my state, they have clinics set up and it is a free treatment, and very successful, but you need to get it in the first 10 days."
5054,Because you're just asking questions?
5055,Oh I'm not bro.
5056,That's the same thing.
5057,My point is it was the 100 percent fact tone that is an issue.
5058,Either side of the fence doesn't matter.
5059,That being said.
5060,People need to use critical thinking beyond what they are told.
5061,There IS a responsibility to inform yourself so you aren't spreading dangerous lies.
5062,", they say, after guzzling farm animal pesticide."
5063,not sure who all these articles and headlines are for exactly... the ones who refuse at this point are pretty set in their ways and making their children orphans is not even enough to change their minds
5064,Chile is not classic strain.
5065,Is Gamma + Lambda.
5066,Got it.
5067,You googled some research and didn't read it.
5068,"So as far as we all know, it doesn't support your claim."
5069,Thanks.
5070,Walgreens gives Flu shots to kids as young as 3 years old.
5071,"I don’t know what the COVID vaccine roll-out will look like, but I feel if they try to exclusively use Pediatrician’s offices there will be a major bottleneck."
5072,Appointments are going to be hard to come by and many rural areas are going to be under served.
5073,But we’ll see.
5074,Several cases rose slower (and were 2/3 of the previous high) and now are on the downturn.
5075,So more cases because of Delta and waning vaccine immunity (before the boosters) and both religious group refusing to get the vaccine.
5076,BUT the vaccine is keeping ppl from going to the hospital.
5077,Israel was looking at a strict lockdown 6 weeks ago so I think they are doing well in their strategy.
5078,The US should note that it often follows the situation in Isreal.
5079,People that had five kids make bad life choices?
5080,Colored me surprised
5081,This was a particularly bad case of someone being cut in half.

5083,They/we did it before Trump as well but maybe it *is* getting worse.
5084,Maybe social media has more to play with that?
5085,Political parties?
5086,Idk.
5087,It does seem beneficial for both parties for polarization to happen.
5088,It makes it harder to acknowledge truths to the other side when that side is deeply demonized (whether rightly or wrongly).

5108,Just like rona was supposed to be a non issue this summer cuz vaccines....
5109,It's not a clear cut path unfortunately.
5110,You tell me.
5111,Its my personal opinion that sky is worse than fox.
5112,My god.
5113,You are a saint.
5114,"I am sorry,"
5115,This unvaccinated pregnant mother was a Labor &amp; Delivery Nurse.
5116,It has been known for longer than 6 months that pregnant women should get vaccinated.
5117,And the father was a math teacher for 20 years.
5118,"These are well educated people, and she is a specialist nurse."
5119,It's frightening that this horrible deadly anti-vaccine propaganda has penetrated and brainwashed people who we previously would have considered intelligent.
5120,This is very very sad.
5121,"The disinformation campaign has been extraordinarily successful, and is still going on, and until we confront it head-on it will continue to kill good people like these."
5122,US had hoarded more vaccines and got them early than any nation on the planet except maybe China.
5123,Their head start made the numbers look better than they are but other countries like Japan where I live are catching up and not slowing down.
5124,Exactly.
5125,And that’s precisely the issue.
5126,"People keep jumping on the bandwagon of the popular ideology of those around them / the media they consume and regurgitate exactly what’s been said to them to fit in, rather than using any logical reasoning skills and coming to their own conclusions."
5127,"It’s has really gotten exponentially worse since Trump took office, and all the media did was either praise him and his supporters or demonize him and his supporters."

5137,Wishing you the best.
5138,Hopefully since you are vaccinated you will only have mild symptoms.
5139,How old are your children?
5140,Do you have anyone who can help care for them?
5141,Getting infected is not ideal but if you got infected pre-vaccine availability then you might as well reap the benefits (if you didn’t die that is).

5143,"i (26f) usually have clear skin but i've been noticing a couple of acne, especially on my forehead which i haven't had since my teenage years."
5144,have any of you noticed acne as a side effect of the vaccine?
5145,Well that's terrifying.
5146,"For her sake, I hope so."
5147,"In the meantime, I’ll be over here teaching in my n95 and advocating for universal masking in school."

5151,"Channeling our inner Varrick today, I see."
5152,It isn’t as simple as anti/pro either.
5153,A person could have standing to suggest the bad for some people to get two shots and good for others.
5154,I believe there was a study in Israel that showed one shot of the vaccine was plenty for younger than 18.
5155,That’s not pro/anti vaccine but could be taken by both sides and slanted to their bias.
5156,People that are healthy but have had covid recently don’t have much of a need compared to those who are unhealthy and don’t have any antibodies or other immune responses to Sars2.
5157,We shouldn’t have to be a monolithic group to have respectful discussions.
5158,"If you have an unvaccinated child, you should have a say over them potentially exposing him."

5175,Will I eventually catch it?

5199,We had to pay 60 dollars per test leaving The Dominican Republic in July.
5200,Same tests.
5201,They are making a killing.

5203,Im sure they will gladly keep it going as long as they can.
5204,You're right.

Well, I for one will not be having sex with any unvaccinated men."
5207,Was that person masked?
5208,"I had covid December 2020 and had the racing heart issues awhile, I can't remember when it stopped."
5209,Even in May or so my heart rate would skyrocket at times when out just walking my dog.
5210,I'm back to normal activity for the last two months or so but I used to run a 8:30-9 min/mile as my easy pace and now it's more like 11-12 min pace.
5211,Even in the past when I took months off from running I would default back within a week or two so I think covid caused some long term impact that is hard to measure in any other way.
5212,How does she get that much time off?
5213,The time off benefits provided by the CARES act are expired as far as I know.

5297,That way parents would be able to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
5298,"My understanding is that because of delta, this is also what I read in r/Covid19, and said by Dr.Fauci that it’s being heavily outcompeted by delta."
5299,"The low percentage is just that, not due to raw data"
5300,"every time there is new information about vaccines for kids the date gets delayed by a month, first it was august, then september, now october, how can they not know?"
5301,"They know how long the trial lasts, they know how much data they will need to sift through, and they know how many people work for them and on what hours....it can't be difficult."
5302,Same here in Canada.
5303,It's depressing as fuck.
5304,&gt; There is a rising discussion in Austria and Germany if the test should remain free.
5305,In Germany it was already announced that tests will costs something starting at the 11th October.
5306,"I had congestion for 3-4 days, no other symptoms."
5307,Chalked it up to allergies until test.
5308,These headlines and stories I think overrepresent the true nature of most breakthrough cases.
5309,Same reason I got (or attempted to get) charged 1000s of dollars for a bag of IV fluid and a pain pill when I had to go to the ER a few years back.
5310,They can.
5311,"&amp;#x200B;

I got Vibrio from eating a raw oyster a few years back and had a nasty stomach issue that landed me in the ER."
5312,I dont recall the exact numbers but the ER tried to charge me 6000 dollars or something similar for literally a bag of fluid and a pain pill.
5313,"Insurance said no, they paid around 600 instead (which is still insane)

Our medical system is beyond fucked up."

5323,"Have fun with your $30000 deductible ;) 

(I actually don't live in the States, thank goodness, so I only have a passing knowledge of how health insurance works in there."
5324,So I assume $30k deductible is a reasonably high rate)
5325,Canada announced mandatory proof of full vaccination for all domestic air and train travel a couple weeks ago (not sure of in place yet as not travelling).
5326,Not even an option for a negative test instead.
5327,And I am all for it.
5328,"Breakthrough cases are 1 in 10,000 so mandatory testing of vaccinated people will be a colossal waste of time."
5329,People just don't understand statistics.
5330,"In their deluded mind, they think their saveing people from the shot"
5331,the percentage is reduced.. bit is it the case for the raw number?
5332,1% today might actually be more in raw number compared to 2% in July if total cases is much higher today.. so it might actually be gaining..
5333,I haven't check historical data though..

5343,"Talking to the workers and owners the biggest problem is actually finding people to work those jobs, some are either reluctant, don't want to deal with obnoxious anti-mask or anti-vax people, are still on government aid, or some combination."

5345,"I've seen my 80-something in-laws about 5 times since May and have a normal social and public life, besides WFH."
5346,"And yet their cases are steadily in the decline to begin with because again delta is out competeting it, also because Mu started in Colombia so no surprise it’s more prevelant

5357,Eating healthy in the USA and having the time to exercise is a luxury.
5358,every employer has plans with different deductibles.
5359,if you're healthy you choose a low cost higher deductible plan and if you need constant prescriptions and visits then you pay the high monthly charge plan with lower costs during treatment

5364,90%+ seems to be even better.
5365,If you don't achieve this with vaccination and past infections you have to take the hard route which unfortunately means mass death.

5373,Yeah I accidentally got two comments confused.
5374,Still applies though.
5375,Wow.
5376,That's crazy.
5377,"That pricing is kind of unthinkable here at the moment, but it's where we need to be."
5378,"And even then, it would create a ""healthcare class divide."""
5379,"If we sent 100 tests a year to every person in America, it would be $30-60 billion per year plus shipping costs at that pricing."
5380,"Aside from vaccines and masks, I don't know a better thing that would help stamp out the virus here."
5381,And children get tested 2-3 times a week in the school for free.
5382,This is a massive misconception with vaccinations.
5383,They work to protect you AND they require high uptake to hit max efficacy in a community.
5384,"You cannot conflate the two, as a lot of people are attempting to do in Covid convos."
5385,"If we had 30-40% vaccination rates for measles and other viruses (polio) North America has effectively stamped out, then those viruses would still be circulating today and impacting parts of society."
5386,The U.S. has 90% of children inoculated with most routine vaccinations (source CDC).
5387,"My one unvaxxed co-worker has been in quarantine about 5 of the last 7 weeks because of her kids getting it one after the other, yes its causing issues."
5388,That might have been the at-home PCR test.
5389,There are antigen tests at Walgreens and CVS for something like 2 for $25.
5390,You can use the website to check which stores near you have them in stock or order them online.
5391,HSA plans you can use pre-tax money to save for the deductible
5392,God this argument is so dumb.
5393,Nobody is being denied access to the vaccines.
5394,There is no inequality in access to the vaccines.
5395,"If anyone is choosing not to get vaccinated, that’s on them."
5396,Race has absolutely nothing to do with this.
5397,"Yes, unfortunately some people will never let the pandemic end no matter what happens and will continue to come up with any reason to shut things down."
5398,"To your point, though, there was an article in the New York Times about this exact issue yesterday and our need for clearly stated goals that guide what our policies should be."
5399,"You can find the article here but I’m linking to the author’s tweets because it actually highlights his points well (and references a 99% vaccinated situation) and won’t be paywalled: https://twitter.com/j_g_allen/status/1437003229875871745?s=21

We need to be clear about the end game."
5400,"If it’s zero covid, then yes we should be as restrictive as possible."
5401,But if it’s not - and most people recognize that this will be endemic - we need to accept that there will be some infections in vaccinated people and in highly vaccinated environments that isn’t a big deal.
5402,"Smoking isn’t contagious either, yet we charge more for it because it’s a major health risk."
5403,"Food is a larger addiction problem in the US compared to smoking, so why shouldn’t we charge for people who refuse to take care of themselves?"
5404,lmao okay.
5405,Sounds like there will be some jobs opening up!
5406,"Study finds that COVID-19 vaccine can make your dong, like, totally enormous"
5407,Agreed.
5408,It should be criminalized.
5409,Nobody said anything about capitalism or hoarding
5410,I hope other companies apply this approach.
5411,I think it will be very effective.
5412,Many anti vax people are really keen on personal responsibility and hate the idea of 'entitlements' like unemployment or food stamps.
5413,They should be fully understanding that others should not have to bear higher health insurance costs because of their poor decisions.
5414,The next major variant will likely be from a Delta strain so a vaccine that better targets delta would still be helpful I imagine.
5415,If such a thing could exist.
5416,I've been waiting/hoping for it and I'm not usually on the side of the insurance companies.
5417,Market pressure is a stronger motivator than political pressure.

5423,Generics wouldn't just magically be super cheap given the supply chain issues mean it would be expensive to increase capacity and the name-brand shots can buy up all inputs since they're making more money from their products.
5424,"Patents should not exist, but we're not going to get rid of patents in the next 6 months."
5425,We need to supply the world with vaccines regardless of how messed up the current system is.
5426,You can't let anti-big pharma principles go to the point you start eating horse paste to stick it to them.
5427,I think it’s this one?
5428,Looks interesting.

5430,"When I asked my colleague to wear a mask while we are at work, because we work together in a small unventilated room with no windows (A/C just circulates the air) he said that was 'a bit extreme' but thankfully he agreed to do it."
5431,I later found out he had been to one of the mass anti-vaccine protests.
5432,He's waiting to see 'what happens to people' after a year or two with the vaccine (he's mentioned some conspiracy type stuff before) and that's why he hasn't gotten the vaccine.
5433,We are fairly civil otherwise.
5434,"Most I've seen are older men (50+), and stay at home moms who spend all day reading conspiracy theories on facebook."
5435,"But I do have a group of younger cousins who all think it is unnecessary too, but they dont view it as a conspiracy, they just dont think they'll get Covid bad."
5436,So some of these people at least may get the vax when their jobs require them.
5437,Smh with these bogus articles counting from the beginning of the year
5438,"""... access to a vaccine, and it will be a very long time before the world can be vaccinated""

All the more reason for those who can get vaccinated to do so."
5439,"However we aren't talking about those who can't medically get vaccinated, were talking about individuals who refuse to get the vaccine based on nothing more then superstition, anti-social behavioral traits, and those steeped in conspiratorial thinking, and yes those who are acting very immaturely."
5440,"Those individuals are responsible for the increase in deaths and infections, as physicians and hospitals across the country attest."
5441,The vast vast majority of those dying are unvaccinated.
5442,There is more than enough vaccine in countries such as the United States to effectively end this pandemic.
5443,"The longer the hold outs last, the more likely we are to see variants, and while most won't be worse then delta, there is still a chance one could immerge."
5444,So far there has been nothing that has convinced those skeptical of the vaccine.
5445,Some have watched family members suffer and die and still refuse to be vaccinated.
5446,Others have taunted those who have lost loved ones and have turned to advocating for vaccinations.
5447,"The behavior has been as described, it is no insult to refer to this behavior and be honest about what it has amounted to."
5448,The bottom line is that there is not reasonable or logical reason to resist vaccinations if you are a healthy individual.
5449,"What would you call someone who refuses to listen to doctors, refuses to listen to the facts, and continual peddles conspiracy theories, and not those who have devoted their life to the study and treatment of disease?"
5450,"""ignorant"" is an accurate description."
5451,"Ignorant: 

1. lacking knowledge or awareness in general; uneducated or unsophisticated."
5452,"2. lacking knowledge, information, or awareness about a particular thing."
5453,3. discourteous or rude.
5454,All of these definitions describe these individuals accurately.
5455,IF you wish to see that as an insult or a personal attack then that is on you.
5456,"This reddit group is not about making those who are against vaccination feel better about their choices or actions, or sparing the feelings of human beings who are willfully harming others."
5457,"Yes, they can and have."
5458,Edit to add: some people who got Covid once and did not develop long Covid have gotten Covid a second time and then gotten long Covid.
5459,Ask about testing for travel to the US.
5460,You can use those tests.

5467,No I believe it'll make things worse because then you're deluged with only bloated research and scientific journals and some of them can be misleading the way a lot of nutritional research data becomes.
5468,"The way you ""fix"" social media at least in your own country the way you're thinking of is to have a regulating and enforcing body thay restricts certain content on social media and if that idea scares you, then you're having the right reaction because essentially that's what China is doing though it is certainly being abused by the CCP."

5532,The number being quoted is adults.
5533,There are still 15% ineligible population.
5534,46% of our population isn't fully vaccinated.
5535,That wouldn't offer herd immunity against the alpha variant.
5536,"Against the Delta variant, it isn't a significant impediment to spread at all."
5537,"Breakthrough infections are not rare, and the vaccine doesn't offer high levels of sterilizing immunity (though its still exceedingly effective against bad outcomes)."
5538,"Even if every single person in the country was fully vaccinated, as opposed to half, it might not offer herd immunity."
5539,"Things would be massively, massively better though."
5540,It looks as though the USA will have to get a good deal more of its immunity via suffering than via science.
5541,"It may be that sterlizing immunity will come once people have two or three shots plus exposure, or a series of shot, we have no idea at the moment."
5542,It may be that we just get shots seasonally once this is more endemic.

5568,I'd think 85.
5569,15 seem to be a very hard no.
5570,Israel also basically stopped testing when they reached their vaccine goal and lifted restrictions.
5571,Denmark did the opposite during spring - tested up to 10% of the population per day in order to stop the increase in cases for every step in the reopening.
5572,It worked.
5573,Swedens situation now is very different from Denmark - case numbers has increased more than 3x the past month.
5574,They also tend to not test children with mild or no symptoms.
5575,This is the age group with highest infection rate and steepest rise in all the neighbouring countries.
5576,And they are the only country in Europe who doesn’t vaccinate 12-15 year olds.
5577,It will be very interesting to see what happens when they lift all restrictions in a few weeks.
5578,Our provincial healthcare body has mandated vaccines for employees and contract workers.
5579,"They are the largest employer in the province, including for nurses."
5580,"I saw the nurses union put out a statement that they would represent nurses terminated if it was “discriminatory against religious belief or illness/disability” but also said effectively vaccines work, get vaccinated unless an exemption like that actually applies."
5581,So we will see how it plays out if any nurses are terminated.
5582,Also I wonder what they do if the vaccinated nurses file grievances that they are exposed to an unsafe working environment because of unvaccinated nurses?
5583,"This is what I fear will happen if we get mandatory testing - that the administration will see that raw cases are high (when the vaccine isn’t meant to prevent infection), overreact, and go remote."
5584,"This reminds me of when the CDC said not to wear masks, because of masking shortages to HCW..."
5585,I agree vax is a global issue and a national approach with open borders is short sighted at best.

5640,I just want to quickly respond to your first statement.
5641,You’re just being silly if you thought I meant athletes would become obese if they are excess calories.
5642,That’s not what I was talking about and that should’ve been pretty dang obvious.
5643,Stop being silly.
5644,I’m also not trying to take the reductive viewpoint in this considering in my very first paragraph I said that the government needs to get a handle on this by forcing manufacturers and growers to make the healthy options the easy options.
5645,Everything I said after that is based upon that thought.
5646,"My second paragraph was more a statement about how it isn’t as hard as people make it out to be, just less enjoyable."
5647,But it truly isn’t that hard if you make it a habit.
5648,Having access to the food is one thing and that was what I was trying to cover in my first paragraph.
5649,Sorry if that point didn’t come across clearly.

5752,Depends.
5753,Both major vaccine makers have looked into strain specific boosters and so far have come to conclude that another shot of the original is about as good.
5754,Any of the booster shots gives a massive antibody increase over the first regime and there's strong theories that this 3rd dose could last for 5-10 years actually given the antibody decay rate turning a standard 2 dose into a standard 3 dose only schedule.
5755,"Even so, one shot every 6 months is something I can deal with to lower my risk of having a chest x-ray that looks like my lungs are filled with cotton balls."

5761,"This virus is unlikely to go away, and I seriously doubt we'll ever have a better vaccine, so it seems to me like we'll have to accept the risk of catching covid while vaccinated (which is already very much diminished compared to being unvaccinated), just like we accept all sorts of other risks in our daily life, or am I missing something?"

5875,Do people really think that only government regulations affect how people act?
5876,"If the cases surge in a region, people start acting differently, taking more personal precautions."
5877,"Often that comes hand in hand with government regulations as well, but not always."
5878,"They're called waves for a reason, cases spike, people change their behavior, cases drop, people relax their behavior, cases spike, repeat."
5879,"The problem will come when the vaccinated people don't change their behavior in response to a spike, which will create a much larger spike in the unvaccinated."
5880,This is one of the reasons we're seeing health authorities implement vaccine passport systems in many places.
5881,"worldwide, production capacity still hasn't match demand."
5882,"So, although the amount of vaccines is not ""fixed"", it is still insufficient."
5883,"I would say two things are simultaneously true:

1."
5884,"As a young vaccinated person, the actual risk of her having any serious complications from COVID-19 is non-zero but very low, even with international travel and going somewhere with a high case count."
5885,"If she is really looking forward to this trip and is just looking for an honest risk assessment of whether it's safe to go or way too dangerous to risk, then the answer is it's pretty safe and she should go."
5886,"(If you're living with an elderly person or someone else who might be very vulnerable, that might change my assessment.)"
5887,2.
5888,"If the two of you have extremely low risk tolerance and feel extremely anxious and unsafe about this, that won't make for a very enjoyable trip, so you shouldn't feel bad about canceling and maybe eating the cost if that's what you two feel like you need to do."
5889,"The HHS Data which comes from the Hospitals direct reports to the federal government provides a good look at the data that has not be ""vetted"" buy the Florida health department."
5890,"Current Adult hospitalizations are at 11,379 down from 17,000 a couple weeks ago."
5891,The daily admission numbers are also down.
5892,Average length of hospital stay has remined consistent for the last several months around 6 days.
5893,"If we take today's admissions and multiply that by 6 we get around 8,200."
5894,This is another indicator that hospitalizations are trending down.
5895,Note Kentucky looks particularly bad using this metric as their current daily admission support a total hospitalized rate 71% above where they are currently at.
5896,It could get ugly there.
5897,The Hospitals also report deaths daily.
5898,Caveat would be that these deaths have not yet been vetted as due to Covid and these numbers would also not pick up people who died at home.
5899,The 7 day average of Covid deaths reported by hospitals peaked last week at around 280 per day.
5900,"The last four days saw deaths reported of 223, 240, 220, 236."
5901,So slowly trending down but still way too high.
5902,Based on how the deaths over the last month  ramped up we will likely see an average of around 200 deaths per day for the next month in Florida.
5903,"This will add an additional 6,000 deaths to the state increasing the total deaths by 12% in just one month."
5904,"For reference note that Florida hospitals reported 18 Covid Deaths on July 1, 81 on August 1st, and 274 on September 1st."
5905,As Florida has only just passed the peak on the death curve there will unfortunately be many more deaths to come until death levels are back down to July 1 levels.
5906,I would guess we will be back down to July levels in early November assuming another wave has not begun by then.
5907,&gt; The main point of the vaccines was to protect against severe/death - it ended up being a bonus that they protected against catching covid too.
5908,"No, Primary endpoints were efficacy against symptomatic infection and adverse events (safety)."
5909,Efficacy against severe Covid-19 was secondary endpoint.
5910,"This applies for [Pfizer/BioNTech](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577), [Moderna](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2035389) and AstraZeneca: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31604-4/fulltext"
5911,This is also true at most jobs.
5912,What about these retirements?
5913,Same here in Oklahoma- I am so sick of these so called all lives matter idiots !
5914,If all lives matter - why not get the vaccine ?
5915,Around 70% of deaths were double vaccinated for the period detailed in the last Public Health England covid surveillance report.
5916,"Since so many people in the UK are vaccinated especially in older age groups, this doesn't actually mean the vaccines aren't preventing death, but it is at nowhere near the efficacy that the statistic in that article would have you believe."
5917,It's too bad you can't just put a vaccine in the drinking water.
5918,Oh well.
5919,"Problem will solve itself soon enough, and a lot of states should be much more competitive next election."
5920,Just a shame the census didn’t happen after all of this…….
5921,In my country a 3rd werld one I have to go thru hoops like show I have a valid prescription issued within 6 months to prove I have comorbities so I can get vaxed in May.
5922,I was rejected because my blood pressure and blood sugar pill prescription arw expired so it was only last month I got my 1st dose of a Sinovac.
5923,🤢
5924,So true on all points.
5925,"That’s why I said, we’ll never know."
5926,"Too many variables, and if there are long term ripples from covid like I presume, then it seems quite difficult to really attribute those particular mortalities as covid deaths, (and they probably never will be) but truth be told there probably is many, but how fucking many?"
5927,!
5928,I think for many the stress of going back to the office at all is going to cause strife and issues.
5929,The whole vax/nonvax is just fuel on the fire
5930,Would you feel that way if Trump developed a vaccine and there were docs and others raising concerns about it being rushed and not safe?
5931,I’m vaccinated 100% just some perspective.
5932,"Yes, but early evidence is that they are about half as likely to get long covid if they get infected, plus they are many times less likely to get infected, so the vaccine is excellent protection against long covid."
5933,Not perfect though.
5934,&gt;we still have countless metal detectors at airports and full-body scanners; we still have to take our shoes off and our electronics out of our bags.
5935,"**No one complains about any of these**, and they've been around for 20 years."

6009,"Every person I know who says stuff like this that smokes cigarettes, drinks alcohol, and constantly fill their body with terrible junk and crap consistently."
6010,It seems that SARS2 has established a niche lifecycle where it has a 1 - 2 week period where it suppresses immune signaling and innate immune response enough to proliferate and spread then gets overwhelmed by the now active immune system and the infection ends.
6011,"(Obviously not for everyone, but for most)."
6012,It seems to rely more on its early immune suppression/very efficient transmission/very efficient cell entry and rapid proliferation than classic escape from antibodies and prolonged infection.
6013,"There have been several variants with better antibody escape than Delta, all have fizzled."
6014,Escape from the adaptive immune system doesn’t seem to be a very potent selection factor for this virus.

6017,"I know there’s constant data coming in and new things being learned as time goes on, it’s just frustrating seeing conflicting things (like the vaccine waning anywhere between 5-8 months) and wondering which is more accurate especially when headlines are click baiting and maybe some of the findings are posted prematurely."
6018,The is a window for selfishness.
6019,If 99% of a population is vaccinated it is not very much different than 100%.

6022,The shots are a day of discomfort.
6023,If you really did not care about anyone else would you care if the elderly and vulnerable were dying?
6024,Probably would because we still want them to employ us.

6030,All this time they insisted otherwise.
6031,They lied.
6032,It wouldn’t surprise me at all if FDA comes out saying boosters for immunocompromised only not for general public.
6033,They need to get the under 12 vaccine approved sooner than later though.
6034,I agree we need to start thinking about other countries getting vaccinated.
6035,We can do everything we want in the US but until the world is at a good vaccination clip this virus will have its highs and lows.

6041,Easy solution: fire the unvaxxed.
6042,The thing that everyone is ignoring is spread.
6043,"If 40% of the population got boosters, and boosters reduced the spread by a further 10%, then that is only a 4% reduction in spread overall."
6044,"But unintuitively, a 4% reduction in spread could actually result in cutting cases, hospitalizations, and deaths by a quarter."
6045,Boosters could easily be the difference between full hospitals and almost full hospitals.
6046,"This is an interesting point to be fair, because most of the flights I would consider in Europe are country to country, within the Schengen area."

6050,"I do believe that more data needs to be shown for people like me who are diabetic, have heart disease, high blood pressure, etc."
6051,to determine if we will get any benefit from booster shots.
6052,Currently the boosters are just for immunocompromised and not for others with comorbidities.
6053,That would help provide some reassurance for people like me who were vaxed in Dec-March.
6054,"I'm an introvert, a homebody, but since I became fully vaccinated, I've been going out more to restaurants, spending more time with coworkers, went to a Yankees game, and just enjoying myself more."
6055,"It definitely has boosted my mental health, and while it's not great, I definitely feel more comfortable and safer while still masking up."

6066,I don’t see why they wouldn’t just tap on another letter and continue iteration.
6067,"So, Alpha Alpha, Alpha Beta, Alpha Gamma, etc."
6068,It really doesn’t require a lot of thought being put into this concept.
6069,What happens when we do run out of Greek letters?

6115,"Canceling would mean another girl not being able to go (its booked in pairs at the place they're staying, dont ask me i wasn't involved booking this trip) or it would mean her having to just pay her half of the booking."
6116,What do you guys think?
6117,"Worth eating the cost, or would you feel comfortable going as a fully vaccinated younger person."
6118,"We're both leaning toward canceling, but curious to hear what anyone else thinks."
6119,"""Level 4"" sounds scary but, *a lot* of places are now level 4, including the US."
6120,So maybe we're overreacting
6121,"A two fold increase over Delta is lower than Delta vs the original, by quite a bit iirc."
6122,If that's true it probably can't escape boosters or when the memory system ramps up production.
6123,Wasn’t there a story of the immune compromised patient in England which is where Alpha started?
6124,Maybe that was debunked.

6132,But Idaho built it there anyway because caring about your neighbor (or the environment) is for wimps.

6137,"In the 2020-2021 flu season, as of March only 1 child had died of flu (same article)."
6138,"Keeping kids out of school, masking, social distancing, etc reduced the risk of flu that much."
6139,"In the last year and a half, 400+ kids died from Covid."
6140,"That's even though schools were closed, kids were wearing masks, parents were not in offices, people were not traveling, etc."
6141,"And that was mostly before Delta, which is more transmissible than the original strain."
6142,"Yes, 400 is a small number, relatively."
6143,"Yes, probably more children die in a normal year on school buses or in swimming pools (I did not look that up, I am taking your word for it)."
6144,But it's 400 in a time where we were taking great measures to mitigate risk.
6145,Now we are stopping a lot of those measures.
6146,"Parents are back in offices, kids are back in schools, and much less effort is going towards masking and distancing."
6147,"Some parents and teachers are vaccinated, so that helps a little, but many are not  And we are facing Delta, which spreads more easily."
6148,The circumstances are vastly different.
6149,Why would we expect the risk to remain the same?

6188,Imagine you worked in an environment where everyone was responsible for safety.
6189,Like a construction site or a mine or other heavy industry where a careless worker can hurt others.
6190,"Now imagine you have a coworker who skips the safety trainings, openly flouts PPE requirements, and directly and deliberately violates safety procedures."
6191,In one of those industries the site foreman would write them up and send them home.

6395,In that case thanks Delta for being hyper-contagious but essentially more similar to the original strain in ways that preserve immunity.

6513,"Because it still might be but be very feasible to transport does that are able to be tossed out, but it is easier to give third shots domestically."
6514,I just wonder what the strategy is going to be from here on out.
6515,Even if it gets way more deadly corona will never even come close to ebola.
6516,Plus there's quite a while that you're contagious before being symptomatic.
6517,And if the vaccine starts slowing delta enough mu could spread more easily.

6525,The earth is super pissed at us now
6526,"Worst part is, it'll probably happen in a immunicompromised patient"
6527,I'm optimistic in the fact that a new mRNA vaccine would be on the horizon.
6528,I'm pessimistic that logistics would prevent it from having the critical mass adoption that would be required.
6529,Too many shipping issues that are getting exacerbated currently to have a flawless rollout of any future vaccine.
6530,Depends on the type of mask.
6531,Medical and nk95/ffp2 do protect you and others from spreading it.
6532,Rather stick to these.
6533,"The rather primitive fabric masks, we used to wear in the early months of the pandemic seem to rather only prevented you from spreading it and offer less protection to others aswell."
6534,Have you looked at their ICU numbers?
6535,Not overwhelming their system.
6536,"&gt;Vaccinations are not enough, people will need to continue to do other things (Masking, distancing, etc.)"
6537,in order to keep this under control.
6538,Who's saying otherwise?
6539,I'm not.
6540,I'm pointing out that using the initial R value when cases surge doesn't paint the whole picture.
6541,The R value invariably drops even with little to no measures in place while ICU rates remain manageable.
6542,"That's what endemic COVID will be like and people will just have to get used to higher numbers, especially since the vast majority of infections are mild or symptomatic."

6564,imo.
6565,But is the 'mu' version deadlier than the alpha and gamma versions?
6566,The article does not say.
6567,I'm so confused: is it true that masks only protect others and not the other way around?
6568,"Like for example if I enter a Tram and no one is wearing a mask but I wear mine, is that completely pointless or does it still offer me protection?"
6569,I don't see any reason to think that covid is any worse than the flu for vaccinated people.

6583,I mean yes there's still some danger but you guys have done the best you can to eliminate alot of the danger and so far the vaccines still remain highly effective against hospitlisation should you still be unlucky and catch covid.
6584,Are any of you immunocompromised?
6585,If yes then maybe consider a third shot but if you're not immunocompromised then I'd say go visit them.
6586,I'd probably wear a mask on the flight over just to be safe.
6587,Same side effects we see with current injections.
6588,The injection is no longer in your system after 2 weeks if I'm remembering correctly (I believe the mRNA is broken apart and gone within only a few days).
6589,This actually represented an increase in the 7 day average.

6597,Fortunately it looks like this one is going to be outcompeted by the sheer transmission rate of the delta variant right now.
6598,"Still worrisome though, and a reminder on why we need to get as many people vaccinated as possible so a resistant AND highly transmissible virus doesn't appear."
6599,Every time this virus mutates we're playing Russian Roulette on that combo developing.
6600,Neither a sir nor madam.
6601,I'm one of them thems.
6602,But I appreciate your civil incivility
6603,And vax resistant strains are of course more likely to occur in the vaccinated.
6604,Ultimatively more and more data is gathered from different sources and will build towards a general recommendation.
6605,Israels population is small.
6606,The effect of a 3rd shot is small compared to a scenario where the whole US population would receive a booster whilst many poor countries dont even have their first.
6607,The population of immunocompromised is a lot smaller though.
6608,"So it could be argued to give them a 3rd shot, and for all others only later, when global availability increased."
6609,"So, now we wait until Delta and Mu have a love child and get the ""best"" of both worlds..."
6610,It's more or less random.
6611,Places with a higher number of cases will be more likely to spawn a variant of concern.
6612,"However, there is some evidence suggesting that viruses have an easier time mutating in immunocompromised people."
6613,"For this reason, regions with high incidences of HIV might be likelier origins for variants of concern."

6646,If you feel more comfortable in a mask then that’s your choice.
6647,"But don’t forget that pathogens have always existed, and you likely never wore one before, so there will inevitably be a point where you want to live freely."
6648,The vast majority of people only wear them when they have to.
6649,"The second mask mandates dropped in California (for those glorious few short weeks), almost everyone stopped wearing them immediately."
6650,"No, you seem to be ignoring the fact that the majority of Americans are high risk."
6651,"Obesity, diabetes, etc."
6652,are rampant.

6668,"&gt; Natural immunity is the only explanation for why Delta wasn’t a big deal here

Wait until the fall/winter."
6669,I'd say it's more consequence avoidance.
6670,"If you don't get the shot the chance of an expensive hospital bill goes way up, along with that goes a higher insurance premium."

6673,Howdy neighbour Albertan :)
6674,Not kill but it targets cells that take on cancerous behaviors but problem s during an infection your immune system cells exhibit many of the same behaviors.
6675,"So yes, a person during chemo is considered immune compromised."
6676,I think it’s important to include that he said it made HIS cancer look like a piece of cake.
6677,"The title seems to imply that covid is generally worse than cancer, which is pretty offensive to cancer patients."
6678,Seriously.
6679,And this feels like the type of benefits deserved by people who help keep society running.
6680,"Not just, ""thanks"" to cashiers and nurses."
6681,"But hey, if the person isn't going to look out for themselves."
6682,I totally support pulling back this benefit.
6683,"I’m higher risk and I’m asking my sister once it’s fully approved if she would get it, to protect me, when she comes to visit."
6684,She’s digging so deep in the internet and now talking to “doctors who studied this shit” and telling me she won’t do it.
6685,"I’ve also had similar bad advice so I don’t find her sources entirely credible, especially mentioning the risk of myocarditis in the vaccine but not covid itself."
6686,"This has definitely got me munching on popcorn, watching..."
6687,I think we need to be realistic about the way vaccine uptake is going in the U.S.
6688,"There are an ever-hardening group of people who are unwilling to get the vaccine now, and probably unwilling in the future."
6689,The triple-shot approach may be the best we can do in such a situation.
6690,"If we have additional immunological protection, it could serve to reduce community transmission and healthcare burden against anti-vaxxers."
6691,I don't have data or sources to back that up.
6692,Then again I don't entirely know what will happen or what new information is coming down the pike.
6693,I do know that I'm not in a panic to get my booster.
6694,I also know that I'm worried about the resiliency of the small hospitals that serve my area.
6695,\*munch munch\*
6696,You should try a womandate!
6697,Aye-Oh!
6698,I think if we can hit 75-80% fully vaccinated this disease will become endemic.
6699,"Have to account for natural immunity as well and by the time the vaccinations reach that level, most of the rest of the population will have had delta burn through it."
6700,Which is all the more reason why people should be getting vaccinated... Because some responsible people like Jeff Bridges who are on chemotherapy are not advised to receive such vaccines.
6701,"Before anti-vaxxers say that fully-vaccinated individuals can still spread it, that's true, but critically: **they aren't as contagious for as long**."
6702,"For those that are exposed, there's a fair chance the viral-load exposure would be less, triggering lesser symptoms as well."
6703,Because of vaccine resistance and constant disinformation no self applause please.
6704,The numbers are not good in comparison with other Western nations.
6705,I'm sorry but the vaccine is our biggest weapon against covid.
6706,"Masks, social distancing and negative tests are the minimum safety measures to implement and not the end game."
6707,If everyone got vaccinated Delta would not be a big deal.
6708,Here in San Francisco our hospitals are overwhelmed entirely by unvaccinated people infected with Delta.
6709,Very few have been vaccinated.
6710,"Lupus is so tough dude, (as well out already know) I'm glad she got it done and is in good spirits now!"

6726,"I’m higher risk and I’m asking her to do this, for me, so she can come visit safely."
6727,"She’s saying even if it’s fully approved, she won’t do it."
6728,Friend of mine is the same.
6729,She beat breast cancer after a long struggle and was in remission for years.
6730,She got COVID pre vaccine and came out of that but she was in bad shape.

6922,"&gt;Which is not unreasonable

It's not, however we are literally throwing doses away in the US and there's no way those doses are going to go to the countries that they are focused on here."
6923,"So the choice isn't between boosters in the US/Europe vs first shots in other countries, it's between boosters in the US/Europe and throwing those doses in the garbage."
6924,I'll take boosters.
6925,This is it.
6926,Our media has failed us.

6931,"I understand changing conditions of the data and the virus itself, but not the voluntary decision to not support J&amp;J at any level close to the other vaccines, just because it became less ""popular""."
6932,"Using boosters in the UK would make little sense since the UK operated on a different dosing schedule, did not rely completely on Pfizer, nor are they seeing similar hospitalization results."
6933,"There is no good evidence that the other vaccines are seeing as strong a drop in efficacy like Pfizer, so there is no real reason that the other vaccines need boosters so soon."
6934,"The truth is that Israel is an important data point, but their relinance on Pfizer may have proved to be their undoing."
6935,In Israel only 60% of the population are fully vaccinated (plus a few percent recovered + a few percent with one dose).
6936,Yet the number of cases is stable and so are the severe cases.
6937,Few restrictions on vaccinated individuals (indoor mask mandate).
6938,So 80% fully vaccinated seems more than enough to get back to normal.

6944,Generally speaking the theory is that the south's numbers are high in the summer when people are inside in the AC because its so hot while up north people spend more time outside compared to the winter.
6945,The north's numbers are higher in the fall/winter because people are inside because its cold while down south people head outside more in the fall.
6946,Obviously the low vaccinations in the south are playing a huge role but the regions spike at different times.
6947,Now that school is starting in NY and the weather will be getting colder sending more people indoors we are going to face the same problems we did last year.
6948,Yes we have a lot of vaccinated people but there are still millions of unvaccinated New Yorkers.

Or if the cure for the disease is available at the local farm supply store, that's comforting too."
7003,"You're safe, just get that cure in you."
7004,It's orders of magnitude more common with covid itself.
7005,"I think they're being a little dishonest by implying there anything other than a millions to one chance of a booster shot being worse than a breakthrough infection; they also neglected to mention Israel has been keeping track of booster side effects and has found no such significant risk, placing a lower bound on how frequently it could occur."
7006,"Granted if you step outside the evidence on the mRNA vaccines, for other vaccine types that's probably a more valid concern."
7007,You're probably fine.
7008,The J&amp;J vaccine is targeted in a similar way.
7009,It only instructs your cells to produce the spike protein (as do the mRNA vaccines) but by using a different vector: a disarmed adenovirus.
7010,It's nothing like an actual COVID-19 infection.

7035,"Low O2 is not the only reason to be hospitalized from covid and ignores blood clots, dehydration, complications of diabetes brought on through a covid infection, and heart or kidney issues."
7036,"Furthermore, some of those at high risk are hospitalized to seek antibody therapies that need to be delivered intravenously, still using up hospital resources."
7037,"Lastly, a covid positive patient, even admitted for other reasons, still poses a strain on hospital resources as they require closer monitoring and must be kept isolated from other non covid patients that may be at higher risk of covid infected."
7038,"The article seems to be trying to make it sound like high hospitalizations are a non issue because some don't have low O2 levels, but ignores that it's still straining medical resources at hospitals."

7155,I both worked out and drank on both days that I got my 2 shots and never had an issue.
7156,You're overthinking it.
7157,Just get the shot.
7158,You'll be fine.
7159,At least they have decent vaccines where i live they are administering deactivated virus vaccines instead of MRNA ones.
7160,"I'm thinking that this behavior, or lack thereof,  does not bode well for other behaviors and lifestyle changes that will be needed of citizens related to our future crises from man-made climate change."
7161,"700k a day is a ""screeching halt""?"
7162,[removed]
7163,Still completely mind boggling to me that the vaccines weren't mandated for health care workers from day one.
7164,Black Americans were withheld medical treatment in Tuskegee.
7165,This isn't the case at all now.
7166,Noone is withholding any vaccines from Black Americans.
7167,As far as I understand The reproduction number R is the number of individuals that an infected individuals will infect.
7168,If R&gt;1  then the number of infected individuals will grow exponentially.
7169,"(as long as R is constant)

The basic reproduction number R0 is reproduction number in a population with no natural immunity and no vaccinated individuals."
7170,Note that R0 is independent of the number of vaccinated people.
7171,If you vaccinate enough people then you can end up in a situation where R&lt;1 whereas R0&gt;1
7172,1.
7173,"It's Tuskegee, not ""Tuskgee""."
7174,2.
7175,"Don't assume you know my race or apparent ""privilege""."
7176,3.
7177,Get a fucking vaccine or eventually get sick and get others sick.
7178,It's pretty simple dude.
7179,Do them at home
7180,Relax.
7181,"I was just commenting on how shitty our healthcare system is, not trying to insult anyone else."
7182,That should be pretty obvious.
7183,Stop trying to create drama where there is none.
7184,These trials are for kids under 12.
7185,Walmart has them now for $14 dollars.
7186,I just picked up 4 of them.
7187,You have every right to be pissed off.
7188,I think you are saying something that is playing out currently.
7189,"You see reports that ""30% of cases are among the vaccinated"" etc."
7190,So think about it.
7191,"Say that breakthrough cases are 1 in 10,000 and you're 10 times more likely to get it if you are unvaccinated, so that is 1 in 1,000."
7192,Say that you have a population that is 75% vaccinated.
7193,The ratio of unvaccinated to vaccinated cases is about 4:1.
7194,"So even though the vaccinated people are protected, because there are more of them, there are a significant number of cases."
7195,"Or look at it another way, the vaccinated population in the US is about 180 million, at a breakthrough rate of 1 in 10,000 that's still 18,000 cases."
7196,"Or if you give 1 million vaccinations in a day, statistically 100 of those will still get the virus."
7197,"Even if the virus is far more common among the unvaccinated, it is still present among the vaccinated."
7198,But another variable is that transmission is far higher among the unvaccinated.
7199,At 25% of the population there are enough unvaccinated people to keep the virus alive and spreading which is really what is driving the cases.
7200,The more you cut into that the fewer cases anyone has.
7201,Once we get that down to something like 10% then I think the game is over.
7202,"Yes, I did mention that thought."
7203,My dad just got a third shot because of psoriasis and arthritis.
7204,"Even though boosters don't officially start until later in the month, a lot of places will do a third shot completely on the books with a doctor's note."
7205,This might be something to look into!
7206,[removed]
7207,&gt;The exit plan is to get a highly vaccinated population and open up on their own terms.
7208,"Nobody really believed COVID zero was sustainable forever but smaller, isolated countries like NZ and Australia had opportunities that Europe and The America's didn't have so that's what they pursued."
7209,Australia just had their hand forced a bit sooner than expected with the Delta strain.
7210,I'm aware that's the plan - I'm saying with Delta it's gone out of the window.
7211,Trying to constantly get down to zero is silly.
7212,"Australia appear to have realized that and a controlled reopening of borders etc is more sensible, especially since there's breakthrough infections anyway."
7213,Cases simply will come back at some point.
7214,i'm pretty sure glasses are expensive worldwide.
7215,i'm in the netherlands and my current glasses were about 500 eur.
7216,"i think it has to do with how specialized each pair is, fitting pretty much perfectly for one person and one person only."
7217,else they might cost like 10 bucks at your pharmacist
7218,"Oh they're way past that, they *love* Remdesivier."
7219,"Considering COVID can literally kill you, seems like quite the risk"
7220,"I just think it comes from a huge place of privilege for you to be okay with hindering Black American’s ability to travel, when historically, Black Americans were unethically tested on (by the CDC)."
7221,"See: [Tuskgee Syphilis Study](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_Syphilis_Study)

I think Black Americans are smart enough to make their own decisions about their own bodies, do you agree?"
7222,Ask your doctor for it
7223,A work colleague recently died from Covid after contacting the it while on a trip in Mexico.
7224,His wife was sending constant update on his status.
7225,It sounded horrific and I wouldn’t wish it on anyone.
7226,All these anti-vax people have no idea what they’re in store for if they get a severe case.
7227,Keep in mind this guy was only 45 years old and his only pre-existing condition was hypertension.
7228,Step by step breakdown of the progression as I understand it.
7229,"Started with usual symptoms of feeling flu-ish, began having mild breathing problems so we went to the hospital, spent a couple days like that with just doctors monitoring him."
7230,"Breathing issues began to worsen so he was given oxygen, eventually he took an experimental medication which didn’t help but also caused a blood clot in his leg."
7231,"His condition worsened more and he was intubated, a few days later his kidneys began to fail and he was put on dialysis."
7232,He was then put on life support but a day later his body shut down and drs couldn’t revive him with CPR.
7233,My uncle also passed away a month ago and had basically the same progression but they were able to revive him three times.
7234,By the third time my dad made the call to stop trying because the dr said he’s basically going to be living on life support and have major brain damage if they continue.
7235,"He wasn’t even anti-vax, just too lazy to go and do it."
7236,"I mean, the number of kids who are suffering because their damn idiotic parents aren’t getting vaccinated!"
7237,A whole generation of orphans that didn’t have to happen.
7238,Smfh!

7399,Reminds me of a story I read in school.
7400,"Basically after the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster, people started harassing family members, people who saw it, etc online."
7401,"A reporter tracked down one of the people harassing these people and the guy said something like, ""Well, I don't know them so it didn't really bother me to say that stuff."""
7402,"It's essentially the same thing here, unfortunately."
7403,"These people don't believe it's a big deal, don't take it seriously, don't want to change their lives until their life, their family's life, or someone they know has been seriously impacted by CoVid."

7407,If you got sick and recovered  from the alpha variant via natural immunity.
7408,Wouldn't your body be fully succeptical to the Delta due to antigenetic drift?

7427,That means 1/3 of californians are not vaccinated.
7428,There are around 7 million kids 13 and under.
7429,This means that there’s 5 million eligible population.
7430,This means that there are 26/32 = 80%+ eligible population at least has 1  dose.

7625,I hate how people say “you can still get infected and transmit if you’re vaccinated!!

7650,Which the muscle cells in your arm where you got your shot doesn't have a lot of.
7651,"Now In the example of the study that this post was originally about, they were talking about the CD147 receptor which is another major receptor for spike."
7652,"Thing is, it's also not expressed at super high levels in your arm muscle."
7653,Vaccines work systemically because your immune system is everywhere.
7654,But the vaccine only lives locally.
7655,There is always the risk of some spike spilling into the blood stream and traveling to wear it could bind.
7656,But it's not likely to be a whole lot.
7657,Which likely wouldn't cause too much of a change overall.
7658,That and because the full length spike protein isn't necessarily not stabilized.
7659,It's binding requires a lot of other mechanics.
7660,The spikes being expressed here start out as closed conformation just like all the others.
7661,"Because we aren't regularly injecting people with just wild spike protein, we can't say for sure that they could even unfold on their own to attach to receptors."
7662,"In the paper this post was citing, they were talking about the left over bits of virus that are in your blood after natural infection, which is never just a spike protein, it'll be whole pieces of envelope with other proteins as well, so it's hard to say for a fact that it was just the spike itself In a vacuum that would cause any sort of toxic response"

7747,I never got a flu shot until last year.

7763,It's the complete opposite of what they're telling you.
7764,"Being pregnant is hard on a woman's body, her lungs, heart,  and organs are eventually working for her AND another life."
7765,Getting COVID while pregnant is dangerous.
7766,Too many people spreading rumors from very poor studies without bothering to read them or wait for peer review.
7767,Same shit with that mask study that was done in Bangladesh.

7781,"If so, how many knuckleheads will sue?"
7782,you often don't know what your last words will be.
7783,It’s not even solely income.
7784,"An educated person may make slightly less income in a place like Ohio, but many will make up for it with the much lower cost of living."
7785,"To be honest, for a lot of people it’s simply culture."
7786,It’s hard going through the pandemic and feeling the same about home.
7787,"So many people having parties, coughing on people, and demanding that everyone take off their masks."
7788,This doesn’t get me started with the antisemitism.
7789,It honestly felt unsafe at times in Ohio.
7790,I think personally I would’ve probably abandoned Ohio regardless.
7791,"The culture always was off-putting to me, but the pandemic just sped up the worst of the cultural issues."
7792,I interviewed a bunch of pediatricians for my new born.
7793,Asked them all about the COVID vaccine.
7794,It was obvious they knew the same thing you or I would have known had we read the CDCs site closely.
7795,"Primary care doctors aren't vaccine researchers, they just trust the FDA/CDC/Scientists more than nurses."
7796,I will leave you with this: https://www.thedailybeast.com/stella-immanuel-trumps-new-covid-doctor-believes-in-alien-dna-demon-sperm-and-hydroxychloroquine
7797,Not just that.
7798,There is absolutely no way that FDA can stop it from getting approved.
7799,"With soo much political pressure and news, even if they see it as 50% effective, they are bound to approve it."
7800,"In case it helps you next time, there are internet companies that sell them cheap now."
7801,I ordered some from Zenni and am extremely happy with them.
7802,It is kind of self-service and a bit of a gamble picking frames online (though they have tools to help) but they are so cheap you can order a few different ones and then have back-ups.
7803,Yes.
7804,Fatality rate is much higher than whooping cough at the very least.
7805,"Like if we can eradicate it (or close to eradicate) it with a yearly vaccine, why wouldn't we?"
7806,Do you not get a flu shot?
7807,"Thank you, hun."
7808,Same to Germany 🇩🇪
7809,"The sad thing is this will keep happening until vaccines are approved, though even then there’ll probably still be someone who turns down the vaccine for some reason."
7810,She would not have to take care of them.
7811,I was fat enough to blow past a BMI of 35 so I got priority vaccinated.
7812,I managed to lose 22 pounds since my first shot thankfully.

7830,Sorry for not using the whole sentence.
7831,Tylenol and fluids like Gatorade is what I did.
7832,Think it’s good to still try and eat if you can.
7833,I tried going without Tylenol but eventually gave in and then thirty minutes later was already feeling much better.
7834,It’s only right before getting the shot they say don’t take it.
7835,Also my fever/migraine came on 24 hours after second shot and was gone after 32ish hours post 2 shot.
7836,Took Tylenol around hour 29/30.
7837,Same.
7838,It’s the same thing everywhere rural and even outer suburbs.
7839,Lots of these communities wonder why all the kids leave and never come back.
7840,It’s always the culture.
7841,Why stay in a hick town when you can live in the city and feel comfortable?
7842,"The antisemitism, anti-vaccination, and anti-intellectualism is why I sometimes struggle with Ohio."
7843,It’s gotten so bad where I always say I was a born Masshole (born in Springfield) before begrudgingly admitting how I was raised in Ohio.
7844,It’s sad because I’ve become embarrassed of my own state.
7845,Hard to read sarcasm thru a text gotta put /s
7846,I have a study 2 hours away I applied for.
7847,Thank you for this
7848,Constitution republic with democratically elected representatives.
7849,Very good for Ireland however it’s insane thinking it can lift all measures in October.
7850,It needs to wait until kids can get the shot if it wants to put the pandemic behind it.
7851,This is definately a crashed plane in a tree situation.

7856,"We're trying to contradict our reputation as the ""land of the free """
7857,Wo...would that work?!?
7858,"I mean, ivermectin is generally well tolerated by humans even in multiple times the therapeutic dose."
7859,"Even if, as is the case in fact, ivermectin is completely useless in vivo for the treatment of COVID, maybe offering a prescription for the human drug along with the vaccine might increase uptake of the vaccine?"
7860,"And it might clear up their worm and nit problems, too!"
7861,Congratulations!
7862,My world change for the better when my little girl was born.
7863,[removed]
7864,And not wise enough to see that theRESPONSE to the vaccine is also politically motivated.
7865,"Yes, they should have looked at “both sides”"
7866,"Just out of curiosity, what part of five in needles five years bothers you?"
7867,"I would certainly be concerned about world-wide supply, but personally, needing to have a needle every year doesn't seem nearly as onerous as needing to figure out what to have for dinner every night."
7868,This scares me :( my hubby has hypertension.
7869,"He's fully vaccinated though, but I'm hoping boosters are available early next year where I am."
7870,Do you really need an answer to this?
7871,It is not the nurse practitioners.
7872,P.S.
7873,if you have ever been on a maturity ward.
7874,The vast vast majority of the work is not done by doctors or nurse practitioners.
7875,which is more preferrable?
7876,"Hard short lockdowns, or long soft lockdowns?"

7878,This is a nice control group to see if stupidity is spread through genetics or environment.
7879,"So much pain, suffering and death (health and economic) in the UK could have been prevented if they got on to vaccinating this demographic earlier."
7880,Technically I don't see why it couldn't.
7881,"My guess is you'd have other symptoms though, likely a headache or sinus pressure and wouldn't be able to distinguish it from  a headache caused by the high blood pressure."

7897,Herd immunity at 120% vaccinated
7898,There are definitely US and KY highways that go through Hazard.
7899,"I did some searching, and I could be wrong, but there doesn't appear to be an official meaning of ""major"" for US or state highways."
7900,As an aside - driving in that area is...hairy.
7901,"Honestly, it's the second scariest area to drive in I've ever been (#1 is US 95 through Idaho, of course - I saw an injury attorney website call it ""An American Catastrophe"")."
7902,"I did the famous Going-to-the-Sun-Road last month, and it was easy peasy in comparison."
7903,"Crumbling, unmaintained roads with unbelievable twists and blind curves - on two-way one-way roads!"
7904,"One time I hit a pothole with a rental car on a KY highway, bent the rim, had to walk a long distance to get a cell signal, managed to get another rental car, and on the way back popped the tire on THAT car from an unavoidable new jagged gash in the road."
7905,Constant landslides - sometimes I'd just have to not be able to do any chores for a day or two because the only route out of town that didn't take an extra 2 and a half hours was blocked from a cliffslide just falling onto the road.
7906,Usually took them a day at least to clean 'em up.
7907,"So yeah, there's roads that lead out, and the one going to London, KY (where the interstate is) was almost always drivable, but the dire state of infrastructure made travel extremely hairy."
7908,"Dealt with years of infertility, miscarriage, and heartbreak."
7909,"Finally pregnant with an IVF miracle baby, and was absolutely terrified to get the shot."
7910,"But I did it anyway, because the data showed it was overwhelmingly ok, and I’m not a doctor so I trust those who have had more education than me in that area."
7911,People can be so dumb.
7912,"Fear is not a reason to not do something, it’s a signal to pause and assess."
7913,Can’t stand seeing this utter waste of lives.
7914,"Not just that they’re safe during pregnancy, but that *they protect the baby from Covid*, too."
7915,"Children are highly vulnerable to Covid complications during their first 12-24 months of life, and can’t yet get the vaccine themselves."
7916,Getting vaccinated before or during pregnancy is offering your future child an excellent chance of avoiding a terrible fate.
7917,"If you don’t want to do the rapid test at a doctor office, the BinaxNow test comes with two tester sticks, and it cost like $25."
7918,Trick is that you have to buy it before they sellnout
7919,I worked at LensCrafters over 25yrs ago.
7920,It appears that you certainly understand the very high mark up on frames and lenses.
7921,"A $200 pair of frames, costs like $5 to make, if that"
7922,Anytime someone comes in w symptoms of covid we automatically suggest that they get an antigen test and a PCR test to confirm.
7923,Antigen tests are around 86% accurate when given on the 6-7 day of invention.
7924,If given before that date the rate of accuracy falls greatly.
7925,The test is around 30% accurate on the 1-2 days of infection.
7926,PCR tests are much more sensitive and false positives are very rare.
7927,"- source, I am a nurse who has been conducting covid testing across my state."
7928,Acne can be a side effect of soooo many other things.
7929,Could be diet/hormone/anxiety related.
7930,EXACTLY!
7931,These people never cared about anyone other then themselves.
7932,"All their ""I did my part"" BS is just their way of trying to justify their selfishness."

7942,You should feel good about your choice to vaccinate if you’re trying to conceive.
7943,"If your wife did end up pregnant and contracted COVID while pregnant, it would increase the mortality risk for both her and the baby."
7944,As someone who actually has diagnosed fertility issues I had to go through IVF to conceive and got my second shot the day after my embryo transfer.
7945,The embryo implanted and I’m halfway through my pregnancy with a healthy child.
7946,I also plan on getting in the booster right before I deliver if my doctor recommends it.
7947,Don’t let the infertility myths scare you.

7949,"I dunno, if I was really bored I would Not be doing anything that leaves me incapable of being bored for the next decade and a half because it eats up so very much money, time, and energy that boredom is a honey-sweet nostalgic memory."
7950,Much better return on investment to be creative and find different ways to have fun with an opposite sex partner that can’t possibly result in pregnancy.
7951,The internet is full of variations.
7952,Or learn how to make ring mail or carve soap or spin dog fur or breed tarantulas or dye things with plants.
7953,Weird out your family and make friends with oddly interesting people.
7954,Can the virus cause temporary high blood pressure with no other symptoms?
7955,So inconsistent.
7956,The governor wants his state to retain its autonomy from the Federal government while denying the same for municipalities.

7959,"You are correct, CD147 is the target of this paper, it is also a secondary entry point in certain tissues, here in pericytes, but it's also importantfor how the virus attacks nerve cells, which is what leads to the loss of smell, but ACE2 is the primary."
7960,The spike protein mechanics have to work the same way though.
7961,The paper In question describes these symptoms occurring in post covid patients who haven't fully cleared their viral load.
7962,These lingering bits of virus can stick around for a long time as your body continues to clean the battlefield.
7963,"But they are never just a spike protein, they'd be partially assembled Frankenstein parts that flew our when your immune system gorked the cells that were infected, they got caught in the middle of the replication and assembly process."
7964,"Their claim here of ""not the leading receptor mediating signaling"" is more careful wording because they are only describing in the context of this post covid response, not in active infection."
7965,"So not an incorrect statement, but careful wording on behalf of the authors to make sure nobody tries to apply their claim beyond the scope of this work."

7991,"ATAGI (Government org that provides ministerial advice re: vaccinations) recommended against AZ for our under 50's due to blood-clotting risks, and it's only been post-delta outbreak that under 50's even had the option to consenting to AZ."
7992,"In my area, it's about a 2 month wait, but that should decrease as more shipments come in."

8001,"I was reacting to ""it is safe to have small amounts of [...] alcohol""."
8002,That is a dangerous thing to say because some people end up drinking during pregnancy with that type of excuse.
8003,The reality is that it isn't safe and that the phase of pregnancy where people are most likely to drink coincides with when it would carry the most risk.
8004,Yeah because America is the only capitalist country

8084,I'm assuming they managed to design the vaccine to have your body make antibodies that attach to a different part of the virus spike protein.
8085,F
8086,"AKA The US is finally confronted with the grave reality that many of its adult population is completely fucking moronic, poorly educated, manipulated heavily by politics and media, combative, and generally uninterested in doing anything for the greater good."
8087,Any idea on whether vaccinated and having a breakthrough case also causes this?
8088,Too soon to tell?
8089,Sounds like ya'll need to learn about the social benefits of throwing rotten fruit at morons.
8090,Of cour$e he would lol
8091,Can they do the same with a loaded baked potato?
8092,I had it in April.
8093,"It was a nightmare in May, much better now but now and then i still get a racing heart for no apparent reason."
8094,A lot of mouthwash kills coronavirus.
8095,"Listerine does, as does anything with CPC (found in anti-gingivitis mouthwash)."

8097,They are correct - we technically cannot know about a new technology or product.
8098,Do they apply that principle consistently to all technologies though?
8099,"We technically cannot know if iPhone use causes cancer 15 years in, because they were only launched in 2007."
8100,5G?
8101,I hope they're still on GSM or whatever the late 90's tech was and you're communicating by text.
8102,"Food additives and technologies are probably the best example - companies can come with new stuff people eat, and there's some regulation, but it is way less strict than that for vaccines."
8103,"In fact, vaccines require more proof about harmful effects than any other category of technology, and this includes data, but also theory: we know the messenger RNA disappears fast from the body, and there is no plausible biological reason why it should affect people years and years after it's gone."
8104,"They're not wrong, but if they are only applying this principle to one category of tech, the one where companies actually need to follow very strict regulations, and not to other categories where companies can launch stuff pretty much at will or with less stringent regulations, it is not really about this risk, it's about something else."

8106,People are throwing temper tantrums in the street over wearing a mask and you think blood testing will change things?
8107,Can't say I agree.
8108,It's no different from what they always do.
8109,A good friend of mine had a transplant.
8110,Same thing.
8111,"Did the right thing, got vaccinated twice, and has something like 3% of the antibodies they should."
8112,"And yeah, they're going to semi isolate until this is over."
8113,The other alternative is dying a horrible death so it's not exactly a tough choice.
8114,It also means homeschooling their kids etc.
8115,It's what adults do when faced with adversity.
8116,Christ.
8117,I left Australia pretty much the week of the outbreak with intent to return as soon as possible.
8118,I don't think I'll ever be able to go back.
8119,"Australia is going to have to come to terms with the fact that they'll either have a decent sized outbreak of at least mild cases when they open, or never open."
8120,It's entirely unrealistic at this point to assume that there will be a point in time where they can open and not experience some level of covid outbreak.
8121,"Yea, that's what it does once it peaks."
8122,It doesn't go up to space forever

8124,What's surprising is that people still call it a 'wealthy democracy'.
8125,"With stupendous amounts of debt and, well, the recent incidents we all know about, I don't think it can be called either one of those terms."
8126,"That said, I think many countries that started vaccination early are now falling behind."
8127,They are hitting a wall where the unvaccinated are all the very young and the very antivaxxer variety.
8128,"In there somewhere, there are also young people with legitimate concern regarding benefits vs risk of not taking a vaccine that's on offer."
8129,"Was on a ""festival/event"" for a week, just did a quick test every morning after getting up (as almost everyone there did) and a verified quick-test was mandatory on arrival."
8130,"It's not a $200 surcharge, it's asking them to pay for their own health insurance, taking into account that they might be hospitalized."
8131,"Does anybody here feel like covid has become ""manageably endemic"" in your area so that you can stop wearing a mask in crowded places / avoiding large social gatherings without that leading to hospitals and morgues being overwhelmed with patients?"
8132,"If so, how'd you get there?"
8133,"I'm in Orlando, FL and it's stopped feeling like we'll reach that point in the foreseeable future, shit is just so bad here."
8134,It'd be nice to have some idea of how any other place has gotten there.
8135,"I know a sufficiently large vaccinated population is the easiest way to achieve this, but unfortunately it seems like that's just not going to happen in Orlando, at least not any time soon."
8136,I'm kinda losing my mind here.
8137,That was an extension of sex and money
8138,It's interesting to me how people propagandize other regular people in behalf of corporations to accept that this is the best we can do in response to statements about what should actually be done.
8139,"The EU, US, UK, and Israel should all be waiving patent protections on life-saving vaccines."
8140,Full stop.
8141,No need to hem and haw about how this is the next best thing.
8142,Bootlicking is not a good look
8143,"So in an enclosed area with poor ventilation, those unvaccinated are free to be maskless and continue to spread this virus that's on its, what, 5^th mutation already?"
8144,"I dunno, **do your part for the good of society**."
8145,The mandate is out there to cover the selfish who refuse to look out for their fellow human-being.

8172,Operation Warp Speed and the subsequent non-profiteering distribution that continues today along with the inoculation programs are probably the very best examples of how socialist programs save us from capitalist blight.
8173,"(the people, as in our democratically elected representatives, paid billions to private and public organizations, of our money, to not compete with each other or try to profit from an existential public necessity.)"
8174,This was *global* socialism; necessary to save us from capitalist/corporatist fuckery that would have cost millions of lives if it had not been put on hold by order of the people.

8208,Swings both ways.
8209,You can die from covid more than a month from your positive test result.
8210,You can also die from a car crash when you tested positive the week before but had no symptoms.
8211,The ONS release stats based on death certificates and then numbers are broadly the same
8212,The non masking and non vaccine taking idiots have prolonged this pandemic by years
8213,Absolutely I am.
8214,And tbh them not having the shot doesn't effect my vaccine you are correct.
8215,But I perfer we all take the right steps in ending the virus.
8216,"And I work with a fuck ton of people in their late 50""s I took my shot for myself and them."
8217,And lastly I'd rather not bring this shit home to my 58 year old mom who watches my 3 year old daughter for me when I'm at work.

8230,"It's not about being contagious, it's about being a drain on society."
8231,Same reason why smokers have higher premiums than non-smokers.
8232,All public and private corporations must be very strict with the UNVACCINATED people to help stop the spread of the deadly virus COVID-19 and its variants.
8233,Lots and lots of unvaccinated people ended up in the intensive care units or dead.
8234,It's just insane to me that people would do that.
8235,"My company did an informal poll as we have many, many employees across the globe and heard a ton of guffawing about it."
8236,I'm taking a less than wild guess that we'll be mandated to get vaccinated too so I'm curious how many of the blowhards will walk away.

8246,Anyone who participates in sports or most outdoor activities should have another premium added as well.
8247,There's over 7 billion people in the world.
8248,110 million doses is a drop in the ocean.
8249,Vaccine donations are not going to solve this.
8250,"What we need is to open source the vaccines and get all the factories in India, Bangladesh and South America pumping out millions of doses per day."

8256,If it would be that deadly it wouldn't spread very far.
8257,"Look at Ebola and MERS, both very deadly, but relatively rare and not an epidemic/pandemic threat."
8258,COVID is especially deadly because of its sweet spot in infectiousness and deadliness.
8259,It's not deadly enough that it gets limited in its spread but infectious enough to spread around quickly.
8260,"And we know by now that most people who land in the hospitals are people who are immunocompromised in some way or another (obesity, other illnesses, etc.)."
8261,Just do whatever you can to lower your risk.
8262,"Vaccines help a lot of course, but they're a bandaid measure."
8263,"If you're overweight, drop some weight."

8268,[removed]
8269,Thanks for the recommendation.
8270,I listen to two episodes last night and they were excellent.
8271,"With the delta variant being so infectious, it's quite possible that we'll all need booster shoots and/or infection-gained immunity in addition to the regular vaccine schedule before the pandemic is over."
8272,Perhaps an annual vaccine as well as Covid becomes endemic.
8273,My concern with claims that natural immunity is superior is that it edges on to the territory of anti-vaxx rhetoric.
8274,"(I'm also not convinced that it's actually true, but like you said, there are a lot of nuances to such a comparison.)"
8275,I can easily imagine vaccine-hesitant individuals using that claim as an argument to avoid vaccination and embrace the possibility of exposure instead (e.g.
8276,"""why would I get a vaccine when natural immunity is better?"")"
8277,or to claim that they've already been exposed and therefore don't need to be vaccinated because they're already protected.
8278,The latter is the most common argument against vaccination that you hear in my native Bulgaria (the least vaccinated country in the EU).
8279,"Everyone vaguely claims to have already had Covid-19, even if they never experienced the characteristic symptoms, so they can claim to already be protected."
8280,"Of course, even if that were true, vaccination would only improve their immunity, but not everyone is interested in those kinds of subtleties."
8281,"The claim that natural immunity is superior could easily become a rallying cry for many anti-vaxxers if it starts to circulate in the general public, so it's a claim worth scrutinizing very carefully."
8282,It's honestly insane to me how much misinformation has now driven this country into a divide over a public health crisis that is affecting the ENTIRE GLOBE.
8283,"I'm so sick of seeing ""The Democrats will make this virus last forever because of their agenda and Bill Gates and and and.."" Listen to yourselves people!"
8284,You sound insane!
8285,"But now, it's more than just a handful of folks - it's spreading like this virus."
8286,From a few people to a hundred to thousands to now millions infected by conspiracies.
8287,I really don't know what else we can do but it feels like a war is coming and I'm scared something like on Jan. 6 will happen again sooner than we think.
8288,These people are seriously in the deep end.
8289,Did to highest levels of ignorance of the world's wealthiest.
8290,It literally isn't but whatever makes you feel better.
8291,Blaming the capitalist boogeyman is like conservatives blaming socialism for all their problems.
8292,Jesus.
8293,"I get why you have to pay money cause they have to have it go through a lab or whatever, but 250?"
8294,God damn
8295,"Agreed, but you also wonder if a variant like mu comes around that is more contagious, but less deadly could be a good thing."
8296,"I had to argue with someone on r/worldnews who claimed we know for a fact that Covid will get deadlier, when we don’t, we don’t know if Covid is going to get deadlier as the uears go on, or less deadly."

8298,Is this the fastest vaccination drive in US history?
8299,Have we ever covered 3/4 of the total eligible population within about six months of mass vaccinations?

8318,There are other issues that will impact you.
8319,Some percent of those with vaccine can get covid.

8380,"We also only had like 2 months of data, so long-term protection against severe disease was not known."
8381,"Also, by the time we got eua and started giving shots, WT had been replaced with alpha and we had at least one variants we suspected had some level of immune escape (particularly b.1.351)

8386,"We’ve heard for a long time that the important metrics post-vaccination are be hospitalizations and deaths, not raw cases."
8387,"There was yet another post about testing today, and someone got downvoted to oblivion for suggesting that the vaccine largely prevents serious outcomes, and no longer a major threat to the vaccinated."
8388,"And in response people were saying like they still don’t want to spread it to their family, etc, and how even with the vaccine, why go around spreading the virus when you could stay home?"
8389,"But a question that’s been asked many times now is, if a vaccine can’t get us back to normal life, then what will?"

8407,This is such a bad take and completely false.
8408,Western countries and the US specifically are exporting hundreds of millions of doses.
8409,Moderna tried Beta specific boosters and they were only slightly more effective than another shot of the original.

8465,Rapid tests are best when used regularly and when your goal is to detect infectivity.
8466,The bar to authorize a diagnostic tool is very high because we already have very good diagnostic tests for COVID that tell you whether there is virus present in your system.
8467,Why would you authorize another one that doesn’t detect virus present in your system as well?
8468,Except that is not the right measure for rapid tests.

8715,"That falls in the common sense category,  unfortunately,  a lot of people also don't see the common sense of adapt or die."
8716,The only positive I can come up with anymore is that there's going to be a lot less people to make continued dumb decisions which is good for those that adapt.
8717,"Same thing, same type of people happened in 1930 with small pox as is happening today."
8718,I'm just sick of my wife getting screamed at by morons in the pharmacy.

8720,"Trump is just the symptom of the larger problem, not the cause."
8721,Just remember a lot of the amazing nurses are still there and are vaccinated.
8722,Its just the driveling idiot tribe that crosses all professions.
8723,My wife had a patient other day that works in a certain government agency in the know about this stuff.
8724,He claimed that it won't be until mid 2022.

8728,Your coworkers never learned the take-away lesson from the 'telephone' children's game.
8729,"No, they died BECAUSE of Covid."
8730,That's ignorant as hell.

8750,I wish you the best of luck and and an admin or board that isn’t on Abbott’s side.
8751,Mandating the vaccine is the wrong approach.
8752,I live in Texas and got the vaccine in January.
8753,"I hate the politics here, but as people around me drop like flies from their stupidity, unvaccinated people I believed would never get the vaccine have changed their minds."

8763,They're idiots.
8764,Totally a question for the doctor.
8765,My workplace had been hard at work getting employees to be vaccinated through county regulations and guidelines.
8766,It has worked quite well.
8767,I can't imagine the stress of having to overhear that from your own management.
8768,Awful.
8769,"Generally the RNs, occasionally respiratory therapists (if you can believe that) for the core medical team."
8770,"A lot of ancillary staff such as receptionist, janitorial, coding/billing."

8772,There will always be a shortage due to the structure of the industry and financial incentives.
8773,"Further - everything as already been pushed over the ""edge""."
8774,We're already there.
8775,I can't wait for the retrospectives of unvaccinated nurses being a source of hospital acquired ~~pneumonia~~ covid.

8810,Make damn sure none of them get unemployment.
8811,Have fun working retail with student loans at 40.
8812,Was vaccinated while pregnant in March as soon as eligible.
8813,So much less of a risk than Covid during pregnancy.
8814,Most children already have routine visits with the pediatrician.
8815,"If they have siblings that have to also tag along for the appointments or could be added on, it's even easier to get a jab from one of the nurses in a pediatrician's office."
8816,We've been doing flu shots at the pediatrician's for years and my adult friend even got her Covid shot there because they're offering it.
8817,Whenever I go to the pharmacy it always feels like going out of my way.

8828,Fuck.
8829,Got covid but was already boosted?
8830,That is a bummer.
8831,Not saying it should be a forced test.
8832,"Oh, I understand."
8833,No one is saying natural immunity is better.
8834,To make some immunological observations about differences between natural immunity and vaccine immunity in a biological discussion is not to advocate natural immunity.
8835,We have seen the disastrous effects of that very goal in Florida.
8836,"If people can't see and understand the deadly consequences of that experiment that has been forced on people of the state, they are willfully blind to the truth."
8837,"And if people cherry pick from minute facts reported out of context to bolster a dangerous policy, that needs to be pointed out."
8838,Again and again.
8839,It is exhausting.
8840,"Well, fifty percent effective without a lot of major serious side effects would still be way better than nothing."

8844,You can free tests from CVS and Walgreens but it is extremely inconvenient for working class people because you have to schedule an appointment that may be days away and it is only during pharmacy hours.
8845,"The take home tests are $24 for a pack of two, which is expensive for many people especially when frequent testing is needed for work or school."

8849,That doesn't fix social media though.

8853,"Yea, in that AMA with the Johns Hopkins infectious disease researcher, I think he said he doubted that there'd ever be a delta specific booster."
8854,"We know the current vaccines are safe, and work against delta well enough, so it's not worth the risk of making a whole new formulation."
8855,You could get a non-spike protein antibody test to see if any of those were Covid.
8856,Polio.
8857,Polio was an impressive vaccination effort in the US in the 50s.
8858,Thank heavens- I've heard that viruses that are more dangerous than transmissive tend to 'burn out' quickly (ie.
8859,"Ebola), but there's still the possibility of a massive death toll first."
8860,And the fines?
8861,$500-$1000?!?
8862,How about lifetime ban (from that airline) and START at $5000.
8863,The trend is viruses evolve to less deadly variants over time.
8864,But that is far from a given either.
8865,Cow udder grease: the new ivermectin?
8866,"Yeah, California may be very blue on the coast but even then some violent and racist police forces were in LA and Oakland, both of which had to be forced by federal judges to reform to prevent further civil rights abuses."
8867,Makes sense.
8868,It’s pretty clear that’s the only thing they really care about.
8869,Certainly not other people
8870,Because the last time it killed more than half a million people in a single year was over 100 years ago?
8871,I knew about in July when this seminal paper (which since then has mercifully been debunked) came out on heart inflammation and covid19: https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2768916
8872,That first shot certainly eased my mind a whole lot!
8873,"Actually, it was my husband getting his first shot that made me lose a lot of stress and worry; me getting mine as well was just the icing on the cake, so to speak."
8874,(both fully vaxxed and ready to get a booster when required)
8875,Yep.
8876,"And mine got vaxxed early, I hope they approve a 3rd dose even if it’s just 60+"
8877,What does Mother's Opposed to the Occult have to do with this?
8878,That can't happen while we currently have overtaxed hospitals.
8879,"We are still in the ""novel infection"" portion of the pandemic and that won't end until a majority of people get exposed to covid, either through vaccination or infection."
8880,Vaccination is ideal because it would reduce pressure on healthcare services.
8881,Same….
8882,Getting real sick of this shit honestly.
8883,The only good news I can find is an article from a week ago saying our antibodies are aging like a fine wine  so we actually may be more protected the further out from our vaccine than originally reported (65-72%)
8884,I’m interested in historical examples.
8885,"It's probably never going away, but I'll be happy when they have yearly boosters that are catered to the latest variant and available to all ages."
8886,[removed]
8887,And I'm tired if people not listening to the science and think we should vaccinate our kids before proper trials have been conducted.
8888,"Ok, why do you think it’s taking so long?"
8889,"Other than verifying safety and efficacy, what other possible reason could there be for vaccines not to be approved yet for kids?"
8890,"Fortunately I haven't run into one of these protests in person either, I don't usually frequent the parts of Toronto where they hold their rallys."
8891,It is only very recently that they have started targeting hospitals.
8892,Before that they would usually march through the downton and then finish up in front of the Provincial Legislature.
8893,They seemed to take a perverse pleasure in heckling anyone they  would see wearing a mask.
8894,The extent of the antivax sentiment depends highly on where you live.
8895,"Here in Ontario we are at 78% vaccinated among eligible people so the antivaxxers are a distinct, albeit very loud minority."
8896,"I think things are significantly worse in other parts of North America, especially in the Southern States in the US."
8897,Would you really want people who reject science to deliver your baby anyway?
8898,Not to mention potentially infecting your newborn with Covid.
8899,Oh great.
8900,I love reading this as a parent of a 16 month old.
8901,"For the ones you self-administer at home, yes."

8903,Mandatory testing for the vaccinated is a waste of time and money.
8904,"Isn’t the other way more likely - the child caught the virus at school and infected its father, who just happened to finish his quarantine ?"
8905,"Wow, 'British Trump' being himself some more, I see."
8906,:(
8907,Have you met people?
8908,This is how we beat COVID and finally get people vaccinated and wearing masks: mandates.
8909,"4% of Delta's workforce have the mentality of abused children, who respond only to punishment, rather than incentives or rational discussion."
8910,"That raises an interesting question in my mind, about how the prevalence of authoritarian, punishment based parenting might be reflected in such things."
8911,Ah good to know.
8912,"No judgement here, I was happy to see fans having a good time."
8913,I’ve got my tickets to the USGP next month here in Austin.
8914,I’m really hoping they can work something similar out.
8915,I’m scared they will cancel it.
8916,I bet they’re glad too.
8917,"Tbf, if only 20% of them have gotten the vaccine, it looks like 80% of them are."

8919,My own local is currently dealing with a vocal anti-vaxx minority.
8920,Not sure how it plays out yet with the mandates for companies with over 100 employees but I do know our leadership is dreading the day when they are asked to represent these people.
8921,Cristoforo Colombo
8922,I wonder why people keep trying to fly if you are not going to put your mask on… and then get surprised when they get kicked off.
8923,Has this not happened enough times to know how it’s going to end?
8924,Maybe I missed it but is this telehealth company at least selling the human version of the drug?
8925,"It's spelled ""[yep](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/yep),"" by the way."
8926,yep.
8927,US and Europe have already pretty good vaccine uptake.
8928,"Summed to the natural immunity that will be acquired in the forthcoming Autumn months, 90+% immunity is very very near."
8929,Health officials should start making plans how to deal with endemic COVID.
8930,I imagine they will hire new staff.
8931,"hahaha, yes technically that's what she was supposed to be doing."
8932,"That event already required a negative test or vaccine certificate to get in (""Testen voor toegang"", ""Testing for access"") and such events didn't require social distancing to begin with."
8933,"I'll agree that the Dutch are lousy with social distancing in general, but this is just a poor example."
8934,If they’re under 18 just make them?
8935,You’re their parent.
8936,"Ah, *there's* the bard."
8937,Because all of the rest of us and all of our kids are vaccinated...she'll get it next and it'll be another two more weeks (all of her kids are over 12 as well).
8938,"Cambridge, MA here."
8939,It's been at least 3 months since someone I know had covid.
8940,"At my work and stores, everyone wears masks, no drama."
8941,"Going outdoors, people generally are normal, unless it's playground or around kids, then you see more people wearing masks."
8942,"The city also took the chance when foot traffic was low due to pandemic and lockdown, and made changes and improvements to the street, so that's nice."
8943,"Most businesses are open, aside from the ones that closed when we shut down hard, it's sad to see not all those spaces filling back up."
8944,All restaurants have opened indoor dining.
8945,"Traffic is starting to happen again, especially around school zones, more parents seem to be driving."
8946,"Noooo, forcing the the people who have actively shown they care about the lives of those around them to work in close quarters with the people *who've gone out of their way to show they don't give a fuck about anyone else at all* is causing problems and tensions at work?!"

8953,"Just remove ""breakthrough"" from your last sentence and you sound exactly like an antivaxxer."
8954,But don’t we have three times or more cases since July?
8955,"Although it may have went from 2% to 1% it’s quite possible the total number of people infected with mu has increased since July, or do you have data in absolute numbers?"
8956,I work for a Fortune 500 company that just started a vaccine mandate.
8957,No weekly testing option.
8958,Everyone has to get vaccinated.
8959,"I’m going to one of our hardest hit, lowest vaccinated, red country plants this week."
8960,This should be fun.
8961,"Whoa - I’m not offering you any advice, and if I were, that advice would be to vaccinate your kids as soon as the vaccine is approved and available!"
8962,"You said you were mentally exhausted worrying about your kids, which I can relate to."
8963,I was simply offering a perspective that might give you a bit of comfort.
8964,But clearly not.
8965,I’m sorry I said anything.
8966,Thank you!
8967,So now people are choosing to resign in America rather than get the jab or get fired... What is the narrative now?
8968,Are they going to continue this and have a half functioning hospital or what?
8969,Is this the 5th or 6th time this has been posted?

8976,"Excess food is a health risk and leads to early death, obesity, and health problems up the whazoo."
8977,"That simple fact is completely undeniable, as hard as it is to hear."
8978,I will agree with you that people in a specific situation where you legitimately have no time to cook or take care of yourself should expect public policy to force food growers and manufacturers to make healthier options the easier option.
8979,Not the processes bullshit we all have forced on us now.
8980,"That being said, way more people than you think are not in that situation and need to take it on themselves to actually eat healthier, learn to properly cook food, and stop buying processed crap in bulk."
8981,"It truly isn’t that hard to make good healthy food, but people that have never known how seem to think it is."
8982,"I promise you, it isn’t."
8983,It just won’t taste as good to start with and that means it’s going to be better for you in the long run since you won’t become addicted to the added sugars and savory fat additives.
8984,This country needs to do better because every generation in the US after Gen Z is going to die an earlier death thanks to obesity.

9441,"&gt;	A small Israeli study recently provided the first evidence that breakthrough infections could lead to long COVID symptoms, although the numbers are small."
9442,"Out of about 1,500 vaccinated health care workers, 39 got infected, and seven reported symptoms that lasted more than six weeks."
9443,"&gt;And a large British study subsequently found about 5% of people who got infected — even though they were fully vaccinated — experienced persistent symptoms, although the study also found that the odds of having symptoms for 28 days or more were halved by having two vaccine doses."
9444,Exactly.
9445,It was arbitrary then and it’s even worse now when kids cluster less than 3 ft apart.
9446,"If it's more antibody- resistant, could recently- recovered delta survivors potentially catch mu also?"
9447,"The other concern is that, having one known variant that's more antibody- resistant, there may be others, they might become more virulent, or more fatal to younger individuals (especially in re-infection cases), and they could render existing vaccines virtually or completely ineffective, necessitating boosters and new vaccines."
9448,"If long covid happens in, say, 10% of unvaccinated people, vaccines essentially cut that number in half."

9481,That's still pretty likely :/
9482,It takes 3-4 years to make a new nurse.
9483,This is one of the odd moments where you can be thankful the delta variant has the market so heavily cornered on transmission right now.

9627,It counts Auckland as being in lockdown from 12 August 2020 to 7 October 2020.
9628,But actually the lockdown was only from 12 August to 30 August.
9629,Auckland was at Level 2 until 7 October but our Level 2 isn't even close to lockdown.
9630,"Everything is open, no masks were even required, no work from home or stay at home requirements, full travel freedom."
9631,It's more relaxed than the standard level of restrictions in much of Europe and the US now.
9632,So 199 days is really incorrect.
9633,"Auckland is actually at 107 days in true lockdown as of today, with a minimum of 22 to go in this current lockdown."
9634,How do I say this respectfully.
9635,Almost 2 years ago we were meant to quarantine in order to eliminate the virus.
9636,"But we didn't commit to quarantine, and everywhere on earth played by different rules and elimination became impossible and then they started pretending elimination was never the goal."
9637,"But instead suppression and control of the virus, for which we had to stay isolated and adopt protective measures, but without official support and without mandates to ensure it actually happens."
9638,"Instead ""personal responsibility"" knowing that most wouldn't do it."
9639,"I'm not complaining about the calls for isolation and protective measures, they were necessary for the public health and if everyone had done them things would have been better."
9640,"But there is a cost to this, lack of social connection is as bad for you as not exercising."
9641,Plus it's hard to exercise in a tiny apartment.
9642,And if you were single at the start of the pandemic following these guidelines means you're still single and have been very much alone alone for 18 months.
9643,"Summer 2020 saw reductions in cases and people started ""returning to normal"" as states went against advice to control the disease."
9644,"Then, predictably the autumn-winter devastation happened and hundreds of thousands died in a short period of time."
9645,"Some restrictions were put back in some places, some countries went back into quarantine, entire regions had totally full hospitals and it seemed like things were just going to keep getting worse."
9646,Then vaccines came out and the rollout was faster than expected but still took months on months.
9647,"And very prematurely people who got the vaccine were told they could return to normal, when only a few weeks later they were then told they couldn't return to normal because the virus (predictably) changed and now we are several steps back from where we were."
9648,"And now we are talking about boosters when most of the world still isn't even vaccinated, when are talking about vaccine hesitancy because half the people in the US have decided they don't want the pandemic to be under control enough for the acute phase to end, and it seems like things will still get worse before they get better."
9649,"Media and some health professionals so much touted the 90+% efficacy against death, that people thought the vaccine would mean they were safe."
9650,"But long covid can happen to people who are even asymptomatic, and Delta had cut in half or more the ability to prevent asymptomatic infection based on early and sparse data."
9651,"Protective measures being those to protect the community rather than yourself, not knowing if you have covid and potentially being a vector means that you're still isolating and taking other measures despite the vaccine."
9652,"People are upset and unhappy about getting yo-yoed around, having public messaging changing over and over."
9653,"Having inconsistent and ever changing official guidance, rules, and laws."
9654,"Many people have done everything they are supposed to despite the significant mental and emotional cost of doing so, and they were repeatedly told this would help end the pandemic and get things to a good place."
9655,"But things are only getting worse, and those who don't follow the rules have been pretending everything is over since may of 2020."
9656,And unless they get severe covid or long covid their lives were actually better for it.
9657,"So yes, they want the vaccine which is the only real tool they have any control over, to protect them completely so that they can stop making daily sacrifices."
9658,Of course they do.

9720,"He requested the localities to stick to directions from central agencies, especially the policy of considering communes and wards as “fortresses” and people as “warriors” in the fight against COVID-19, and taking the people as the centre and subject of pandemic prevention and control activities."
9721,"The Government leader asked the provinces to set specific goals when applying social distancing measures, and make the utmost efforts to put the pandemic under control by September 30 at the latest."
9722,He reminded sectors and localities to strengthen communication activities to provide the people with information and knowledge in pandemic prevention and control.
9723,"Regarding vaccine issues, the PM held that together with efforts to buy and import vaccines, it is crucial to speed up the research of home-grown vaccines as well as the transfer of technology for vaccine production inside the country."

9725,"The ministry should also prepare vaccines for following years as well as vaccines for children, he asked."

9771,"HÀ NỘI — The environment sector in many localities, especially those severely hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, has strengthened measures to protect environmental workers from being infected with coronavirus when collecting waste."
9772,"In Hà Nội, Tống Việt Dũng, deputy director of the Urban and Industrial Environment No 13 Joint Stock Company, said the company provided enough protective equipment for its environmental workers to ensure their safety."
9773,"The company had also constantly disseminated regulations on pandemic prevention and control, he said."
9774,"Lê Thị Linh, an environmental worker of the company, said she was always equipped with protective clothing when she did her job."
9775,Linh added that she had already received one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine.
9776,"In HCM City, Huỳnh Minh Nhựt, director of HCM City Urban Environment Company Limited, said the company not only equipped personal protective equipment but also instructed environmental workers on how to obey regulations on anti-pandemic prevention in each location that they had to collect waste."
9777,"The company allocated over 300 environmental workers to collect waste in lockdown areas three shifts daily, he said."
9778,"The environmental workers had to work very hard to ensure all the waste would be transported to treatment areas in order to minimise the risk of cross infection in lockdown areas, he said."
9779,"However, because the amount of waste was large and the collection sites were far away from each other, this put great pressure on the environmental workers, he said."
9780,"Nguyễn Văn Thiền, chairman of the Board of Directors of Bình Dương Water Supply Sewerage Environment Ltd., said the company’s waste treatment branch had about 800 employees."
9781,Thiền said waste transported to the company would be treated by specialised machines and an automatic disinfecting and burning system.
9782,"The most dangerous stage was when workers had to collect waste from lockdown and quarantined areas, he added."
9783,"Therefore, the company had provided protective clothing to environmental workers to ensure their safety during waste collection."
9784,The company also periodically conducted COVID tests for environmental workers.
9785,"The company has applied the ""three on-site"" model, which involves eating, sleeping, and working without leaving and aims to keep operation and production going while meeting COVID-19 control and prevention measures."
9786,"Under the model, the company arranges accommodation for environmental workers at the company."
9787,The accommodation is disinfected three times daily to ensure safety.
9788,"Phùng Chí Sỹ, director of the Environmental Technology Centre, said environmental workers who directly collected waste in areas where COVID-19 patients lived or were treated, played an important role in controlling and preventing the spread of the pandemic."
9789,"So, they needed to be classified as a frontline group and given priority for vaccination, he said."
9790,Sỹ also said that waste in areas with cases of COVID-19 infection as well as lockdown and quarantined areas should be carefully sorted to reduce pressure on environmental workers and treatment plants.
9791,"Nguyễn Thượng Hiền, deputy head of the Việt Nam Environment Administration under the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, said environmental workers had to collect and transport waste daily."
9792,"They were a very-high risk group for COVID-19 infection, he said."
9793,"Therefore, the ministry already proposed to the Government that environmental workers should be given priority for vaccination as well as regular tests to ensure their safety."
9794,"More waste discharged  
  
In Hà Nội, the total amount of waste has increased by about 30 per cent, equal to 7.5 tonnes per day, compared to pre-pandemic levels."
9795,The company has sharply increased the frequency of waste collection in quarantined and lockdown areas.
9796,The company’s waste treatment factory now operates eight hours daily instead of five as before.
9797,The waste is transported to the factory for treatment following a route that avoids going through residential areas to minimise the spread of the pandemic.
9798,"In HCM City, the local Natural Resources and Environment Department said the amount of waste discharged in field hospitals and quarantined areas was 78 tonnes daily."
9799,"In Bình Dương Province, the amount of waste discharged in field hospitals and quarantined areas is about 70 tonnes daily."
9800,"In response to the situation, the environment ministry has cooperated with the Ministry of Health to issue technical guidelines to instruct localities on how to treat waste related to SARS-CoV-2 right after the pandemic hit the country."
9801,Such waste will be treated as hazardous.
9802,"In July, the ministry continued sending document 4119/BTNMT-TCMT to ask localities nationwide to strengthen measures to deal with waste related to COVID-19."

9820,HÀ NỘI — The Ministry of Health held an online training conference on Monday on a project to enhance the supply and use of medical oxygen for facilities treating COVID-19 patients.
9821,"The conference saw participation from more than 1,000 locations in 63 provinces and cities."
9822,"The conference aims to prepare, respond proactively, promptly and effectively in terms of medical oxygen for emergencies and for the treatment of COVID-19 patients."
9823,"Speaking at the conference, Deputy Minister of Health Trần Văn Thuấn emphasised that investing in the medical oxygen supply system would be an investment for the long term."
9824,"""The investment, expansion of production scale, supply network and technical infrastructure of medical oxygen at medical examination and treatment facilities is not only for the COVID-19 pandemic but also for the future,"" he said."
9825,"In some southern provinces and cities, the number of new cases of COVID-19 along with the current number of cases and the need for medical treatment for other diseases has resulted in an increasing demand for medical oxygen."
9826,"The percentage of COVID-19 patients who have the need for oxygen ranging from mild levels such as oxygen masks, oxygen therapy glasses and high flow oxygen to severe levels such as non-invasive and invasive ventilation, ECMO, accounting for about 9.5 per cent of the total cases."
9827,"According to Nguyễn Minh Tuấn, Director of the Department of Medical Equipment and Construction, Ministry of Health, in Việt Nam, the supply capacity of oxygen across the country is about 1,200 tonnes of liquid oxygen per day and can be increased by 50 per cent to 100 per cent as needed."
9828,"Regarding the status of medical oxygen technical infrastructure in medical facilities, it basically meets routine medical care, but there are still some limitations when the number of COVID-19 patients increases."
9829,"In fact, many medical facilities at the district level do not have a central oxygen system; lack oxygen containers (such as bottles, flasks, tanks); and do not back up the number of containers when they have to be rotated, or used for support for home treatment and emergency transportation."
9830,"Establishments in remote areas often have difficulty accessing oxygen supplies, while the ability to coordinate and mobilise oxygen has not been prompt in intensive situations like natural disasters (storms, floods, power outages, etc.)"

9833,4308/QD-BYT on strengthening the capacity to supply medical oxygen for facilities treating COVID-19 patients.
9834,The main objective of the project is to guide localities to proactively develop plans and organise a close connection between supply and demand in order to exploit resources for producing medical oxygen in the country; prepare medical oxygen infrastructure to treat COVID-19 patients according to different pandemic scenarios.
9835,Deputy Minister Trần Văn Thuấn pointed out four groups of solutions that provinces and cities need to conduct urgently.
9836,"First, reviewing and evaluating the current status of medical oxygen technical infrastructure at medical facilities at all levels and developing a plan, based on the guidance of the Ministry of Health on medical oxygen demand at all levels, to improve the technical infrastructure of medical oxygen systems at facilities treating COVID-19 patients."
9837,"Secondly, localities should assess the ability to produce oxygen, the network of oxygen suppliers, to plan and expand the scale of oxygen production and supply to ensure that demand can be met."
9838,"Thirdly, provinces and cities should implement effective connection and coordination among stakeholders: producers, suppliers, transporters and users of oxygen to ensure that emergency needs are met without interruption in various situations."
9839,"The deputy minister requested that localities assign a vice chairman of the people's committees to be the head of the department, the leader of the Department of Health acting as deputy permanent member of the unit in charge of medical oxygen coordination."
9840,"Localities should also strengthen IT application in the management and coordination of medical oxygen, and at the same time properly control the price of medical oxygen in the locality to ensure that the price is not a barrier when the demand for oxygen increases."
9841,"Localities are asked to continue to implement the motto ""four on the spot"", proactively prepare, be ready and promptly respond to medical oxygen needs in emergencies and COVID-19 treatment: planning the procurement of medical oxygen containers and other necessary supplies and equipment; simultaneously, continuously expanding training for doctors, nurses, medical staff at all levels on medical oxygen therapies in treatment suitable to all levels."

9864,Classification of industries and units based on certain criteria would be carried out in order to gradually restore their operations.

9914,"You are right, many of those who have done everything they are asked to are tired of the yo-yo, or those who refuse to do anything seemingly being rewarded for their behaviour (and/or their behaviour causing us to take three steps back for every one step forward)."
9915,People who have given up a lot want the answer that will give them the light at the end of the tunnel.
9916,Vaccines were played up that way.
9917,I also think for me this pandemic has highlighted how media and most of public can’t just hear certain statistics and be trusted to understand them.
9918,"The 90%+ efficacy for example of the mRNA vaccines also had wide ranging confidence interval, and were tested in optimum conditions during a low-transmission time without variants."
9919,"I feel not being honest about that and the limitations just leads to people distrusting the vaccine (calling it a “leaky vaccine”, or pointing to breakthroughs)."
9920,"Instead the messaging could have been it’s not perfect, no vaccines are, but it’s one thing of many things we need to do to move forward and protect selves and others."

9926,"But we introduced a major campaign to vaccinate everyone in very short order, and we've done quite a lot to disseminate vaccines everywhere."
9927,We've also identified the methods of transmission (poor sanitation) and went to work on that.

&gt; Patients will spend the first few days of their illness in a medical facility, moving to home isolation only after their viral loads have fallen."
9977,"&gt; They will have to take a polymerase chain reaction test on the ninth day of their illness, as well as an exit test to determine if they can be discharged from isolation."

10024,Fuck for profit healthcare.
10025,People think it is good idea but forgot how it could be used in a very wrong way
10026,I finally got to see an airport freak out last Friday when waiting at Reagan DCA on my way back to SD.
10027,I figured odds are I'd see one eventually at how prevalent they are.
10028,I was really surprised to see how long they let this guy scream and threaten people before taking him away.
10029,All because they asked for his ID apparently...
10030,"If it is only another 6 months, does that make it not worthwhile?"
10031,"From the paper:

""Although the benefits of primary COVID-19 vaccination clearly outweigh the risks, there could be risks if boosters are widely introduced too soon, or too frequently, especially with vaccines that can have immune-mediated side-effects (such as myocarditis, which is more common  
after the second dose of some mRNA vaccines""

This seems to indicate that they would like to see more data, which should come in few weeks from Israel."
10032,Oh that’s a creative excuse.
10033,"My kid’s university has prohibited professors from telling their classes when they *know* someone in the class has tested positive, with the excuse that it would be a violation of the Covid-positive student’s privacy, because people might be able to guess which classmate was the sick one."

10040,"For smaller issues, I'll end up paying more with the HSA, but if something significant happens there won't be much of a difference."
10041,Main difference for me is that my monthly rate is super low and I do not require any predictable services other than dental cleanings and yearly checkups.
10042,Not much danger in that.
10043,I've tried arguing this exact point on many subreddits and am frequently downvoted.
10044,"In short, ""mild' is just a term used to describe not being hospitalized or dead (yet can be miserable all in itself)"
10045,Nah F that noise.
10046,That’s why I’m not going back to the office.
10047,Great post and great point on outreach.
10048,You mean in the Australian shopping center?
10049,"According to the articles I read, no, they weren't masked (Australia had the mask policy lifted at the time)."
10050,Which did you get?
10051,Pfizer or Moderna?
10052,"i was meaning something more like ""if two weeks from now you haven't been in the hospital..."" sorry for not being more clear."
10053,"Seems though the extension is related to side effects, not necessarily efficacy."
10054,"Maybe the side effects they’re trying to get additional data for comes up early, so they’re able to gather this data point for the new patients in a few weeks, thus the 2 month delay from late August to late October."
10055,"It's so sad, ppl in other countries desperately waiting in lines for vaccines but in US they're literally having to offer money to vaccinate ppl."
10056,This is so sad.
10057,They will go door to door selling crazy.
10058,"Not true:  with a low vaccination rate, in a college, say, where people are forced to go to class in-person and professors are forced to teach in-person, in a world where kids aren’t eligible for vaccination yet, mandatory testing of the vaccinated IS important, though people aren’t doing it anyway."
10059,So many people with kids at home are being forced into face-to-face indoor interaction in low-vax environments it’s really criminal.

10065,"We don’t have in vivo, the claim that it has antibody evasion can’t be truly estimated till we have actual in human data."
10066,"They also dismissed the Mayo Clinic study for the wide CI, however IMO a true value near the upper end of their CI for severe disease *still* justifies a booster, and they also made no mention of several different data sources that also got numbers at or below 80-90% against severe disease in July, and the recent CDC cited study about the larger dropoff for the elderly showing severe disease effectiveness in the 70s."
10067,"They also make the dubious argument that we shouldn't do it if we don't know how long additional protection should last, because it might be very short."
10068,That's both not likely and not a good reason.
10069,"They cite the ethical argument without quantifying the benefit; a single additional shot for 100m elderly and high risk Americans is a mere 1 month of current production levels of Pfizer and Moderna alone, assuming their announced targets are on schedule."
10070,That's not a massive benefit to the globe justifying the harm here.
10071,Tl;dr this letter inappropriately dismisses and ignores the science justifying a booster as motivated reasoning to justify their perception and ethical position.
10072,I don't know what they think this is going to accomplish.

10075,&gt; How do we reach more communities of color with low % vaccinated?
10076,I live in a predominately Spanish-speaking neighborhood in NYC.
10077,Something like half of the people there were born outside the US.
10078,"It's a relatively low-income community, and kind of insular."
10079,This neighborhood also features some of the lowest vaccination rates in all of Manhattan.
10080,"A few times over the past few weeks I've noticed a giant vaccination bus parked on a major street in said neighborhood (with its attendant ""post-vaccination monitoring"" bus right behind it)."
10081,"Each time I saw it, there were long lines of people patiently waiting to get the shot."
10082,It was evident that tons of people were just walking by when they impulsively decided to get vaccinated.
10083,Having Spanish-speaking nurses there surely helped.
10084,"What this tells me is that for some of these communities, the way to reach them is: actually try to reach them."
10085,Bring the vaccine right to them.
10086,Speak to them in their own language.
10087,Make vaccination *easy*.
10088,Make it clear that it's free.
10089,"This won't help for people who are actively anti-vaccine, but for communities like my neighborhood, it can help if we make just that little extra effort."
10090,Reinforced what I already believed and what I’ve been doing.
10091,"Vaccinated status doesn’t mean we can forgo masks, social distancing, and it definitely means I won’t be traveling

10097,The fact is we do not have this scientific data.
10098,This article itself is only on in vitro.
10099,"In vitro data has also caused issues with ppl thinking ivermectin works against Covid then when we get in vivo data, it showed it didn’t."
10100,So no that’s not how in vivo data works
10101,Good thing antivaxxers are keeping Delta going?
10102,"If people would go to CDC's website for their info, they'd find they don't recommend it for folks not moderately to severely immunocompromised."
10103,"Also, science can change."

10105,It's an incredibly GOOD thing when they do this!
10106,We want them to give us their most informed recommendations.
10107,"  
they cite CDC data for their reasons, which arguably isn't that good."
10108,"here, lets take a look at what CDC data tells us:

  
https://twitter.com/MCSlab\_uiuc/status/1436423893833691138  
oh, it tells us that when the CDC tells you the vaccine reduces your risk of hospitalization by 10X!!!!"
10109,"it's because it actually reduces your chance of being infected by 5x, and if you do end up being infected, it merely reduces your chance of hospitalization by 2x."
10110,"if you're over 65, your risk of hospitalization ONCE INFECTED goes from 20% to 10%."
10111,"this is real, this is verified everywhere the data is available."
10112,these data rapists are simply inflating the protection against severe disease to justify letting your grandma die so they can save some people we're probably going to drone strike eventually anyways.
10113,"these experts obviously HATE Americans, especially the elderly."
10114,"because they've decided they want to increase your chance of being infected, and therefor your probability of ending up with severe disease, because they want to save the third world."
10115,Your parents did a PCR 14 days after their original PCR?
10116,"I assume you’re not in the UK, but the guidance here is not to do another PCR for 90 days (unless showing new symptoms)."
10117,"This is due to the sensitivity of the test still showing virus shed, even when no longer contagious."
10118,The entire US economy is greatly influenced by insurance.
10119,Capitalism is about maximizing profit.
10120,"Actuarial methods don’t care about politics, religion, etc."
10121,"in the end, it’s a numbers game."
10122,"BTW, stay away from the sports book folks, I can see the economic slaughter coming."
10123,"yes, please move upwards for your own sake."
10124,you know what's in store if you stay put while the alternative is a significantly better life qualitatively speaking.
10125,The date on the article is from February.
10126,We now have data that indicates protection wanes significantly.
10127,Isn’t it worth noting that even if you get the vaccine you aren’t fully immunized for a few weeks also contributing to the variants.
10128,"People always find a minority to hate on, but that isn’t the whole picture."
10129,If people actually isolated for a bit when they got vaccinated it’s wouldn’t have been able to adapt as fast.
10130,Babies would be a good cause.
10131,Can I put you down for a dime?
10132,"No, the same is not true."
10133,Just in the case of NZ for example it gives number of days in lockdown for regions outside Auckland.
10134,The count does not include any of the time the rest of NZ was in Level 2.
10135,The rest of NZ was in Level 2 from 12 August to 21 September 2020 and is still in Level 2 right now.
10136,But none of that is counted as lockdown.
10137,So the list is clearly inconsistent.
10138,"It can't count Level 2 as lockdown for Auckland, but not for the rest of NZ."
10139,"The list says Massachusetts had 41 days of lockdown, exiting on 4 May 2020."
10140,"But that is only the time when a full stay at home order was in place and does not include the months afterwards with indoor capacity limits, mask mandates and closed schools which are stricter than NZ Level 2."
10141,"So if that is not counted as lockdown for Massachusetts, why is it counted for Auckland?"
10142,The list is totally inconsistent in comparing jurisdictions.
10143,It does NOT count other jurisdictions even within NZ as being in lockdown when no stay at home order was in place.
10144,"It does not count Queensland or South Australia being in lockdowns right now either, but they have capacity limits and mask mandates in place stricter than NZ Level 2."
10145,"Confronted with these assurances, I'll bow my head in shame."
10146,"in what little i could find about this it has an incubation period of normally between 4-14 days, but can be up to 45 days before showing symptoms."
10147,"if it mutates a bit more towards that 45 days is where this variant can be super lethal, and problematic."
10148,"it likely will not, due to how viruses spread."
10149,"Typically systemic respiratory vaccines provide little to no protection against nasal viral shedding, because it requires a mucosal IgA response - which our vaccines do not generate."
10150,"This is the core problem, and is also why Delta got so popular."
10151,"Vaccinated can carry and spread the virus nasally, but not get significantly sick for the most part."
10152,Other variants that don't replicate as aggressively means the vaccinated have more difficulty spreading.
10153,Florida seems to be on the down turn from this last major wave.
10154,The timing seems fairly consistent with what we experienced last year.
10155,Here’s hoping things are better for us here in my state going forward.
10156,I feel like they're weighing logistics and perceptive impact against protection.
10157,"It *likely* helps to some degree, *but sends a bad message* and is *a logistical hurdle to start a booster cycle now*."
10158,"That being said, I expect them to either change their tune in about two months time, or for Covid to be on it's way out in heavily vaccinated countries."
10159,The UK isn't exactly filling me with confidence right now.
10160,"You can tell them the Supreme Court already decided this over a century ago, and the Supreme Court’s opinion trumps their opinion."
10161,"Delta has over 60,000 employees, so 4% is at least 2,400 people"
10162,I feel like there's always a pattern with these incidents.

10201,Numbers from the past 1-2 months would be much more telling.
10202,"The unvaccinated will almost certainly still make up the vast majority of deaths, but I bet it's more than 1% of vaccinated among the deaths."

10204,As a 3rd generation line worker this thought has crossed my mind.
10205,Do I really want to hump this line for another 20 years?
10206,"I'm 30 and can barely even play wow anymore because I lose feeling in my hands constantly, maybe it is time for me to consider it more."
10207,Textile shops and office buildings are great places to spread covid.
10208,The point is that you're using a classic antivaxx argument and it's hypocritical.
10209,Did you honestly not read my message?
10210,I mean the whole thing is talking about how of course people want a vaccine that keeps them completely safe because the minority who follow the rules have been isolating themselves for almost 2 years really just want to be able to live their lives.
10211,Because isolation is a sacrifice that they have made for the common good.
10212,"But because so many people never followed the rules or stopped doing so early, and because governments abandoned the people by removing mandates and not giving support to stay at home, that sacrifice feels like it was for nothing."
10213,"And because so many didn't do the right thing it makes this situation way more complicated, because there can't be an end to covid and we can't figure out how to pay back the people who sacrificed in vain for people who put others at risk in the name of selfish gratification."
10214,Isolation is not about your individual risk calculus.
10215,It's about the community public health.
10216,Your individual self is not really important on this scale.
10217,The individual cannot always trump the community.
10218,That's a completely self destructive way to organize the world.
10219,You accepting the risk for yourself is meaningless because this is a question of you imposing risk on others without their consent.
10220,"And, to be clear, covid carries a 40% risk of long term disability."
10221,That is not something people accept on a daily basis.
10222,That is not a normal situation.
10223,We should not normalize accepting that.
10224,"But, if you have been following the rules, I understand that you are frustrated and you want this all to end because you have been doing the right thing and others are spitting in your face about it, and the government and media and your employer are all yo-yoing you around about it."
10225,I also want this to end.
10226,But I can't give you an end date because so many are pathologically resistant to doing the right thing and extraordinarily committed to believing in some right to risk the health of everyone around them as if it's their choice to make.
10227,I can't tell you when things will be able to go back to normal.
10228,If you've followed the rules for 18 months I understand if you're slowly starting to isolate less and less because it is destructive to your mental and physical health to do so for that extreme stretch of time.
10229,But I can tell you so long as the majority continue to act like the pandemic is over we will never leave the acute phase.
10230,Was Friday two weeks ago?
10231,!
10232,"&gt;I assume by effectiveness against mild disease, they mean actually catching covid."
10233,"And what exactly is ""mild."""
10234,"In the experience of my extended family (so far eleven cases) ""mild"" is only a description used by people who don't have it."
10235,It's miserable.
10236,"Way beyond the flu and with lingering effects, so far, for months."
10237,"Compared to a medically induced coma and intubation it may be mild, but by any objective standard it is very bad."
10238,Hospitalizations in florida are dropping pretty precipitously.
10239,"I get that florida's covid response sucks, but infectious diseases do occur in waves and it's pretty clear that florida and some of the other southern states that have been getting slammed for the past month or two are on the downswing of this delta wave."
10240,Think your view is overly simplistic.
10241,With burnout and folks in the field quitting we are having staffing issues.
10242,Hell a chunk of the industry seems to have anti vax nuts so that’s not helping either
10243,Maybe it's not a matter of principle so much as needing a good enough excuse to do the right thing that won't get you excommunicated from the cult.
10244,"Forget better shift, see if you can move up the ladder."
10245,"Ask if there are any training programs available, because if 70% of your company is about to lose their jobs, someone has to fill those positions."

10329,We just need to get it so that our hospitals aren't overwhelmed by the unvaccinated.
10330,"An 85% reduction in real world risk is phenomenal, once we drive the coverage rate up higher it is certainly a ""mission accomplished"""

10338,"Anecdotally many people (myself included) know fully vaccinated people that got a breakthrough infection and ""mild"" is far from how these people would describe it and many of these cases suffer from long covid."

10340,Researches completely ignoring long term effects of these breakthrough infections just doesn't help.
10341,waste-water monitoring is basically like a group test for a whole community.
10342,"take some sewer water, test it for covid and you'll know quickly if people upstream have covid or not"
10343,Agree.
10344,I've been following the numbers since the beginning of this thing and the US is doing exceptionally well considering how it's become so political.

10353,Some municipal waste water systems regularly sample their wastewater streams for evidence of COVID (and probably other diseases).
10354,It's all part of surveillance.
10355,One example is [MWRA](http://www.mwra.com/biobot/biobotdata.htm).

10363,Covid has crossed to animals (but with no significant mutations noted).
10364,I would assume (And I clearly state I have *no* expertise) significant mutations after crossing zoonotic barriers could mean that it can't cross back to humans.
10365,But more importantly it's the population density.
10366,"We humans are by far, by so so far the largest most social species that mingles in dense populations (And that carries covid, let's not talk about ants)."
10367,Every transmission offers opportunities for further mutations that are most certainly still contractable by other humans.
10368,Unless you wanna talk animal vaccines for covid.
10369,The most important thing is still convincing people to get vaccinated.
10370,Everything else is secondary.
10371,Even more so it's that every mutation is small minute chance that we will see more breakthrough mutations (breakthrough vaccine).
10372,Again I state my lack of expertise.
10373,So feel free to correct me.

10379,"If the R0 is above 1, that means you have exponential growth."
10380,"Reducing it by a even a factor of 100 in the vaccinated population still leaves 13 million unvaccinated in the UK at 80% vaccination, or 65 million unvaccinated in the US at the same rate."
10381,Both of those numbers of unvaccinated are more than enough to overwhelm the hospital systems.
10382,"The only reasons the spread was not going full speed in those populations was the other restrictions and safety measures(both government imposed, and the ones people take by themselves)

If those measures drop off, it will rip through the unvaccinated population in mere months and overwhelm the system."

10388,"Yes, but ...."
10389,The reason for that is that most viruses don't spread presymptomatically.
10390,"So by the time you're contagious, you're ill - and if you're too ill, you won't be mixing in society and you won't have too many opportunities to pass on the virus."
10391,"An extreme example of this is Ebola, where you get so ill so quickly that transmission is very limited."
10392,"So obviously there's normally evolutionary pressure for viruses not to make you too ill, because then that increases their opportunities to be passed on."
10393,"However, this Coronavirus avoids all that by being transmissible in the presymptomatic phase."
10394,"So by the time you get symptoms and fall ill, the virus has done its spreading, and there's no longer any evolutionary pressure towards less severe disease."
10395,Username checks out
10396,The article cited a state official saying there wasn’t a shortage.
10397,Did not get a federal rep to say if there was or wasn’t from what I read.
10398,Or if there was a reason to think there would be.
10399,"Good question,  interesting enough they have the opposite affect then we thought."
10400,Because ACE converts angiotensinogen into angiotensin (which binds to their specific receptors to increase blood pressure) the idea of blocking that action is logical to think it would protect patients from the hypertension caused by the disease.
10401,But they found it actually did the opposite.
10402,"ACE2 is responsible for breaking down angiotensin, so that it's no longer active, thus no longer increasing BP."
10403,"But when there's no Angiotensin  to bind, it leaves many more free to be infected by viruses."
10404,So they found that using ACE inhibitors specifically for a covid treatment was a bad idea cus it sped up the infection process.
10405,"That being said, this is very different from having to take it regularly to control existing hypertension."
10406,"It's never a good idea to go off your meds, and even in the case of disease these will help you compensate a bit, because your receptor profile is very different from a healthy patient who just got hospitalized."
10407,"If you were to go off them, your blood pressure would raise and it would double the affect of the disease."
10408,"In any case the polycystic kidney disease is what would put you at higher risk, not likely the meds."
10409,But it is something that physicians have to take into account when treating covid patients.

10411,"Deaths and death reporting, will lag infections and hospital admittances."
10412,This is the fallout from the most recent spike.
10413,I believe New Mexico has got a wall it's not using.
10414,Anecdotal evidence so far suggests it's less transmissable.
10415,"Given that the majority of transmission is happening among the unvaxxed, then it makes sense that the leading strain would be the more transmissable."
10416,"If we got the ant-vaxxers to vax up, then mu might become dominant, but so many people would be vaxxed that it's likely to be much less of a concern."

10445,"80% coverage is not nearly enough for herd immunity on Delta, that's quite literally the point of this article."
10446,Doctors have been saying that since we started getting more details on Delta transmissibility.
10447,"Maybe 95% would be, but 80 means 1 in 5 people are unvaccinated which leaves plenty of pathways."
10448,Not to mention the fact that Delta is happy to infect and spread from vaccinated people in reasonably high numbers too.
10449,I wish there was a way to communicate this to anti maskers
10450,*Proceeds to hyperventilate uncontrollably*
10451,"From the viruses' perspective, it doesn't matter if they person gets sick or not: just whether they can infect and then spread (symptoms like coughing and sneezing can be a method to spread, but it seems covid spreads fine just from breathing so it doesn't necessarily need that method of spreading)."
10452,So the only controlled studies with regular testing can provide good evidence on this.
10453,"After about 5-6 months, it seems Pfizer doesn't even reduce the risk of infection by half and does even less in preventing transmission."
10454,"So from the virus's perspective, people have little immunity."
10455,So Delta (a highly transmissible variant with very little immune escape) is going to spread much more than Mu (a normally transmissible variant with higher immune escape).

10467,"A part of why is breakthrough infections, and the fact they are clearly not ""rare."""
10468,The number of children and young adults in hospitals (and ICUs) in the US contradicts that assumption.
10469,Delta is not the same as Alpha or Original Strain when it comes to younger demographics.

10478,"After rating ourselves the world's #1 most prepared for a pandemic in 2019, it's pretty sad how the US CDC has just seemed way over their heads with Covid, and pioneered absolutely nothing for responding to this virus."

10488,"I find this so frustrating, as it feels like there is a significant disconnect between scientific theory and real world needs."
10489,"Yes, the vaccine is intended to protect against serious disease and death, but stopping spread should be a priority as statistically the more spread even among vaccinated that small percentage turns into a larger number of people."
10490,"Not to mention, we are seeing that immense burden on our healthcare systems."
10491,"IIRC, these are also the same FDA officials who have been extremely u happy about the FDA being asked to hurry."

10493,I don't think that hospitalization percentage works the way you think it does.
10494,"It's not the ""if you catch it, you're this much less likely to be hospitalized""

It's the ""if you're vaccinated, this is how much less likely you're to be hospitalized than someone unvaccinated""

Those are quite distinct, the first one assumes you've already caught it, while the later includes the chances of not catching it in the first place."
10495,If you catch it though (a breakthrough case) you're essentially just as likely to be hospitalized on a per case basis.

10502,I think your thinking of how rabies tends not to mutate much bc its relatively hard to get but has a high lethality so it has few hosts to spread it.
10503,As per the CDC from 1960 to 2018 there were only 127 cases of rabies in humans in the US.
10504,Whereas there are rough 13 million ppl with HIV in the US and in 2019 there were 34800 new cases.
10505,HIV is just way more transmissible.
10506,The strains of rabies are associated with their animal vectors and there no human specfic rabies virus.
10507,But there are HIV-1 snd HIV-2 in humans.
10508,Flu and Covid are easy to spread and often dont kill their hosts fast so they spread around quickly and have many hosts.
10509,So from a public health stand point they have the potential to be much more dangerous with more impact on the population.
10510,Let me know if im wrong and that's not what you mean.
10511,Cos i may be misinterpreting you.
10512,Its just this just my experience with virus analogies.
10513,*bites arm clean off*
10514,"&gt;Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York has remained resolute that the school year will proceed normally, albeit with safety measures in place."
10515,"But it is still possible that significant in-school transmission this fall could force many school buildings — or even the entire system, if virus case numbers rise substantially — to shut down temporarily."
10516,"&gt;City schools saw remarkably low virus transmission in their buildings last year, but most schools were at significantly reduced capacity."
10517,"Even with a transmission rate of 0.03 percent as of the end of last year, quarantines were still a regular occurrence."
10518,"&gt;This year, at least some level of disruption is inevitable, with the city’s newly announced quarantine policy almost certain to lead to frequent short-term classroom closures."
10519,"&gt;In elementary schools, where children are still too young to be vaccinated, one positive case in a classroom will prompt a 10-day quarantine, and a switch to remote learning, for that entire classroom."
10520,"&gt;In middle and high schools, only unvaccinated students will have to quarantine if exposed to someone with the virus, meaning that unvaccinated students could have a much different school year than their vaccinated classmates."
10521,"More than 60 percent of New York City children eligible for the vaccine have received at least one dose, but the city does not know how many of those children attend its public schools."
10522,"&gt;While the city’s quarantine protocol is more conservative than the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends, New York’s school testing plan is more modest than the C.D.C."
10523,"calls for, alarming some parents and public health experts."
10524,&gt;A random sample of 10 percent of unvaccinated students will be tested in each school every other week; the city was testing 20 percent of people in all school buildings weekly by the end of last year.
10525,Experts have said that the city’s current testing plan will almost certainly be too small in scope to stop many outbreaks before they start.
10526,"&gt;New York has gone further than most districts in the country by implementing a full vaccine mandate for all its educators, along with all adults who work in school buildings."
10527,"The mayor has said he believes that the mandate, along with increasing vaccination rates for eligible students, will help keep schools as safe this year as they were last year."
10528,"I think the problem is, these forums (and real life) are full of people saying, ""You're being crazy, covid is just the flu, kids will be fine, get back to work and stop living in fear!"""

10618,"&gt; and they have a table titled ""Percent of Vaccine Breakthrough Cases among Fully Vaccinated OK Residents""."
10619,"Yes, which is 0.42%, which is 1 in 238, not 1 in 10,000."
10620,"And this only counts everyone that got tested when they had it, which we know is not everyone."
10621,"This also counts everyone that is fully vaccinated, so some of those are very recently fully vaccinated and haven't had many opportunities to contract covid and have a breakthrough case."
10622,So it can’t be vaccine resistant and Delta level infectious at the same time
10623,I'd say it's probably more beneficial for immunocompromised people to get a third shot since 2 doses probably wouldn't have worked on them as well as it did on the rest of us.
10624,I do wonder though what about the rest of like who are fairly healthy and young.

10650,If you are in a category where a 10% improvement is meaningful (e.g.
10651,"highly susceptible individuals) then you can justify getting a boost every 6 months, for everyone else, the protection provided by memory T cells is durable and sufficient, even for variants."

10682,"All the adults are vaccinated, which means even IF they get it they won't get severe disease."
10683,Even if they wore masks it's limited what it will accomplish when you're that close and with so many kids anyways.

10783,I am so thankful that we don't have an utter idiot in charge of making that call.
10784,Exactly.
10785,It doesn’t seem to be nearly as transmissible as Delta and thus will never gain much ground.
10786,"It peaked in July at 2% of positive tests, now it’s well below 1%"
10787,:D
10788,You're missing the important part that polio attacked the central nervous system.
10789,Fat and unhealthy people will always be prone.
10790,Look at Duke University where they're like 98% vaxxed and testing EVERYONE weekly.
10791,"Last I saw, the majority of their breakthrough cases were asymptomatic."
10792,"As long as it buys me a few drinks first, whatever."
10793,Let's ride this roller-coaster all the way down.
10794,Someone recently explained it this way.
10795,We have all gone overboard into the sea and we only have so many lifejackets to go around.
10796,Do we prioritize people who have yet to receive one or do we give them to people who want to replace their slightly worn lifejackets?
10797,"If we can do both, great."
10798,"If no, then it is better for EVERYONE if we get first doses to virgin populations before we consider boosters."
10799,"I wouldn’t say it’s the ONLY explanation, but definitely an explanation."
10800,Areas like NYC are also pretty accepting of mask wearing compared to some of the areas hit hard by delta.
10801,It hasn't been officially recommended or even authorized yet in the US.
10802,"I do know a married couple who has already gotten their booster, one of whom is severely immune compromised."
10803,No questions asked when they went to a pharmacy to ask for it.
10804,"Is it possible that there is a longer incubation period either due to delta, or vaccination status."
10805,"There has been a string of covid cases in the past 1.5 months in my circle, all fully vaccinated."
10806,But the only way they are related is if most of them have an unusually long incubation period (14-21 days).

10809,Never heard of an HSA with employer match.
10810,Even a 6:1 401k employer match is an immediate 17% return.
10811,You can't beat that.
10812,My social media world and my work world are on two different extremes.
10813,"I'm surrounded by antivaxxers at work, and see tons of calls to just go back to full-on lockdown online."
10814,I am definitely more empathetic to the latter group obviously but both extremes are exhausting because they seem to miss the reality that we could stop most hospitalizations and an even greater number of deaths by just vaccinating every adult.
10815,No worries!
10816,"I do appreciate more information, which is why I posted here."
10817,Didn't know if I missed something or if something was planned in the future.

10819,"I don't keep up with all the news, can get draining sometimes..."
10820,"Holy shit, the 3-week-old baby still doesn’t have a name."
10821,That might be one of the saddest things I’ve ever read.
10822,Because there is no law requiring it.
10823,"Congress could pass such a law today if it decided to, but chooses not to."
10824,"Vaccine mandates are instead coming through the workplace safety authority of OSHA and the Department of Labor, and since migrants don't have jobs (yet), they aren't covered."
10825,Jesus fuck people!!!!!
10826,"A coworker of mine is pregnant and vaccinated (pregnant first, then double jabbed) because she has spoken with Drs and decided that she doesn't want to catch covid while pregnant!"
10827,I think she made the right choice!
10828,"She is still pregnant, so I don't know how the unborn baby is doing, but seems to be ok, she is getting all the regular tests, so we will see"
10829,"Simple answer is I'll get what I can get, but I'll keep following the research and if I get a choice I'll decide based on the latest data."

10843,Reality is policy is slow in general.
10844,It's always been reactionary rather than proactive in the US... See: climate change.
10845,"Wish it wasn't, but here we are :/

It's also worth noting that CDC/FDA are under control of the executive branch... Take that for what it's worth."
10846,"Every time I log onto Twitter now I see a thread along the lines of ""I got a supposedly-mild breakthrough case from another vaccinated person and we were both miserably sick for a week, please be careful."""
10847,"Lack of data makes it more difficult, but the reality seems to be that the majority of breakthrough cases are truly mild/asymptomatic."
10848,"Considering that being 1. vaccinated and 2. only unmasked with small groups of vaccinated people is still more careful than half the US is being, I'm afraid that hearing about how awful breakthroughs can be is only making the already-cautious more afraid (""I'm gonna suffer no matter what"") and the careless more careless (""even the vaccinated masked people get it, why should I bother"")."
10849,Oh you do you I’m not trying to influence your decision it’s up to you and your medical care team just pointing out why I think we don’t have a absolute from the FDA yet.
10850,Exactly.
10851,"Afaik the effect of booster shots for fully vaccinated individuals who do not belong to a risk group is more or less completely negligble, and will not significantly help beyond preventing the mildest of cases"

10854,"We have to remember that getting vaccine production up to current levels so quickly took a Manhattan Project level of work, especially for the mRNA vaccines."
10855,"And while the USA and some European countries have vaccine to spare, most countries are still very short."
10856,An updated Covid vaccine would have to be *substantially* better than the current version before it's worth shutting down the production lines to switch over to a new vaccine.
10857,Unpopular opinion here - We try to protect them but they refuse the most effective tool we have.
10858,Why can't we isolate them and prevent them from walking around freely?
10859,Say if someone who had been radioactively contaminated from bathing/drinking from a pipeline supplied by an evil corporation that dumps toxic wastes into the water system.
10860,"They knowingly (or refuse to accept the fact that they are contaminated) go out and about in public, spreading the contamination."
10861,Is this not public threat?
10862,"Do they get to do whatever they want in the name of ""freedom""?"
10863,I think in this case people in hazmat suits would escort said person into a facility until they are no longer a threat from a public health standpoint.
10864,Where do you draw the line of public threat vs selfishness?
10865,"&gt;the only thing that can make me possibly think it was less dumb was it was a little before delta

It was dumb because people lie, and EVERYONE stopped wearing masks."
10866,It was dumb because we don't have a national RealID compliant vaccine credential.
10867,It was dumb because we ask $12/hr grocery workers to enforce mask policies and let sworn police officers decide for themselves what laws to enforce or not.
10868,Hey thanks for the article!

10872,Saying that this is anything other than tragic is still an understatement.
10873,Neither one of these people were so old or so 'compromised' that you can claim that's the reason they've died of coronavirus.
10874,"As much as part of me hates to make an example of this tragedy, I think it needs to be done: this is a prime example of how **irresponsible** it is to not get vaccinated against COVID, because what's going to happen to those five kids now that they don't have parents anymore?"
10875,"COVID has now destroyed an entire family, and it could have been prevented."
10876,"From other articles with an interview with a different family member, it sounds like he was not vaccinated."
10877,"&gt;Davy Macias was 32 weeks pregnant and “optimistic” about her recovery when she was hospitalized in the first weekend of August, Serey said."
10878,"But, she said, the expecting mother was intubated and never met her daughter when she gave birth via Cesarean section on Aug. 18."
10879,Daniel Macias only met his fifth child briefly before he was intubated about three days after her birth.
10880,&gt;Their now 3-week-old daughter remains unnamed
10881,[removed]
10882,Yep.
10883,Everyone gets to make choices about the level of risk they are willing to take and I'm trying not to judge other people who have been vaccinated and are being reasonable but whose tolerance is higher than mine.
10884,(I admit I judge people who are not vaccinated and are taking no precautions at all; maybe that makes me a hypocrite.)
10885,It sure doesn't feel like folks are extending the same courtesy to those of us with a lower tolerance.
10886,If I'm being careful I must be an irrational person who has been driven crazy by the media.

10972,There are lots of conversations on my local sub about when people would be comfortable with lifting mask restrictions and accepting Covid as endemic.
10973,One of the more common criteria is the availability of boosters for the general population.
10974,"It doesn't sound like that's happening any time soon, so some people might need to rethink that."
10975,"Yes, single-vision and weak to boot (-2.75) so I am sure that helps bigtime."

10994,"&gt; And now we are talking about boosters when most of the world still isn't even vaccinated

We need to disconnect the discussion about boosters from the discussion of vaccination in unvaccinated countries."
10995,A production facility in Massachusetts can’t supply doses to Chad just because.
10996,It’s significantly more complicated.
10997,"There’s a reason they’re building production facilities the world over, but it’s slow."
10998,The unfortunate reality is production of boosters is largely unaffected by producing new doses for countries in need.

11085,"Many public school districts have Covid dashboards which, among other things, publish the covid positive rate."
11086,That's the percentage of students/teachers/staff that currently test positive for covid (so does not include those that have recovered and are back at school).
11087,So ideally we'd see a decreasing positivity rate because that means people are recovering and less are contracting covid.
11088,"I understand the factors involved in the rate, my question is more focused on how good/bad are the rates in my initial post compared to other public schools around the country."
11089,Is .01% really good?
11090,is 3% really bad?
11091,"Except this also impacts high risk people, not only regular people."

11095,You make several good points.
11096,I don’t know how you have the energy to be so negative
11097,"They are one of the only districts in the state that doesn’t require masks, of course."
11098,They’re just outside of Charlotte.
11099,"This decision is the mindspring of pathologically disturbed, anti-social, greedy people in power."
11100,We all know where the money trails lead and the hidden motives behind this decision.
11101,It’s immoral and sociopathic to hide this vital information from the public.
11102,A state is funded by taxpayer money.
11103,State politicians are paid by taxpayer funds and answerable to taxpayers.
11104,"They also get free healthcare, retirement pensions and benefits paid by taxpayers."
11105,"They have a moral,  ethical, and sworn duty to protect and serve their constituents, especially during a community spread public health crisis."
11106,If they were good people they would do the right thing.
11107,This demonstrates their compete lack of humanity.
11108,It’s unconscionable.
11109,Are you young and healthy?
11110,"If so, you really shouldn’t get a booster that’s not recommended by your doctor."
11111,"After I was fully vaccinated, I booked a trip to Florida Disney World about 7 months out, this was before the monumental deaths in Florida."
11112,I was not as harsh and over protective with my parents for going out or working.
11113,"My dad beat liver cancer, has diabetes, and high blood pressure and other things like survived a stroke."
11114,My mother has always been healthy.
11115,So I worried less and they still wear mask while going to the store since they are vaccinated.
11116,"Honestly, being vaccinated helped ease my mind over my families health."
11117,"I am fortunate that all my friends and family believe in the vaccine, taken the vaccine if they are eligible, and mask."
11118,The only thing is the young children in the family that cannot be vaccinated yet.
11119,So I feel that Covid 19 is more manageable and that my kin has the antibody profile to defeat this Covid 19 virus and do not have to suffer if they catch a huge viral load of Covid 19.
11120,"Thankfully, it's not out-competing with Delta."
11121,Strange statement when I read that back to myself.
11122,No one?
11123,"So Fauci, the US surgeon general, the WHO, and the CDC are no one?"
11124,That's news to me.

In the clip, Dr Fauci says “There’s no reason to be walking around with a mask."
11126,"When you’re in the middle of an outbreak, wearing a mask might make people feel a little bit better and it might even block a droplet, but it’s not providing the perfect protection that people think that it is."
11127,"And, often, there are unintended consequences — people keep fiddling with the mask and they keep touching their face.”

The US surgeon general, Dr. Vivek Murthy, Feb. 29, 2020
""“Seriously people — STOP BUYING MASKS!” the surgeon general, Jerome M. Adams, said in a tweet on Saturday morning."
11128,"“They are NOT effective in preventing general public from catching #Coronavirus, but if health care providers can’t get them to care for sick patients, it puts them and our communities at risk!”""

11129,Despite having zero evidence that masks were ineffective.
11130,I don't understand the USA... but their states seem to be on the side of Covid in this fight...
11131,It sounds very confusing.

11134,How are the vaccines holding up against it
11135,"I'm in MA, we're good about masking and one of the most vaxxed states..."
11136,I'm not able to sit here and say that if I were living in a state like Florida.
11137,"Mentally it's not something I worry about anymore, just the frequently touched stuff."
11138,That can of arizona tea i just drank wasn't going to do me in.
11139,"Bonus Points: I think a lot of us realized, after not getting sick of flu or colds this past season, that masks fucking work."
11140,And that extra sanitation has it's benefits outside of corona obviously as well.
11141,Second shot Moderna gave me side effects similar to a hangover.
11142,"The next day I woke up with an incredible headache and my entire body hurt, but by the end of that same day I felt 80% better."
11143,Third shot Moderna taken 6 months after 2nd dose was much closer to the first for me in terms of side effects.
11144,"Only the injection site was sore, my body ached maybe 10-20% more but nothing debilitating or that I had to take a sick day for."

11185,"Union County schools stop COVID contact tracing, quarantining for non-positive students, staff

UNION COUNTY, N.C. — The Union County Public School Board voted Monday morning to end COVID-19 contact tracing and quarantining for non-positive students and staff."
11186,That means students can go to school even if they have come in close contact with someone who is COVID positive.
11187,The only people who have to stay home are those who have tested positive or have symptoms.
11188,The decision is effective immediately.
11189,Union County schools do not require masks for students and staff.
11190,"The Union County Board of Education met in emergency session on Monday morning, and COVID-19 protocols were the main focus."
11191,"Later Monday, the school district issued the following statement:

“At the Sept. 13 Special Called meeting, the Union County Board of Education voted effective immediately, to halt all staff responsibilities regarding contact tracing and quarantining for students and staff, except as required by law."
11192,The statutory authority of managing contact tracing and quarantining is that of Union County Public Health.
11193,"“As required by law, school nurses, administrators and school staff will continue to address positive, presumptive or confirmed cases of COVID-19."
11194,"All students and staff who do not have a positive COVID-19 test or symptoms, should return to school or work immediately."
11195,"“If students or employees have the following symptoms: fever or chills, sore throat, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea, diarrhea and vomiting, headache, they should stay home, stay away from others and call their health care provider."
11196,"“Students and employees who have been isolated due to a positive case or COVID-19 symptoms, should not report to school or work until they have completed 10 days of isolation, symptoms have improved and fever free for 24 hours without fever-reducing medication."
11197,"“Face coverings are still optional for students and staff in Union County Public Schools.”

Union County Public Health Director Dennis Joyner sent a letter on Friday to the county school district with COVID-19 recommendations."
11198,The letter was sent as cases and the number of students and staff members quarantined continue to rise in Union County.
11199,"**As of Friday, 479 students and employees had tested positive for the virus, and 7,285 were in quarantine."
11200,"**

**Union County Schools is one of only five districts in North Carolina where masks are optional."
11201,"** In the letter from Joyner, he advised that masks be required."
11202,He also said a 14-day quarantine is the best option to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.
11203,"“Without a universal mask requirement in Union County public schools, a 14-day quarantine period remains the best option to provide for the protection of student, teachers, staff and members of the community,” the letter said."
11204,"&gt;&gt; To view the full letter, click here."
11205,Many parents have been in favor of choice because they believe COVID-19 rarely harms children.
11206,"Dr. Benny Joyner, who is the vice chair for safety at the Department of Pediatrics at the UNC Children’s hospital, said they are wrong."
11207,“I would say they need to come into my ICU.
11208,"I’ve got six, now five, critically ill pediatric COVID patients."
11209,Two of them have breathing tubes inserted to basically breathe for them.
11210,"Two of them are infants,” he said."
11211,"“What I would say, the delta variant has really made the respiratory phase of the illness much more prominent than before,” Joyner said."
11212,"“We have young men and women who are just struggling, gasping to breathe, unable to complete sentences."
11213,"We have little babies on breathing machines who are heavily sedated from COVID -- it’s a challenge.”

**The school board has heard from many parents on the issue but, so far, the freedom to choose side has won out."
11214,"**

“I think it’s important to everyone to be able to tell their kids what they can wear and what they can’t wear,” parent Eric McCorkle said."
11215,"“It’s bad when we get to a place in society that a little bit is taken away, each time just a little bit here and a little bit there and before you know it, it’s a whole lot.”

“To keep everybody safe, it should be mandatory that we wear masks,” parent Samira Maske said."
11216,There is now evidence that surface transmission is incredibly low.
11217,"You need to breathe it in, not eat it."
11218,Sanitation is still good.
11219,It's just not the concern they originally thought.
11220,"""When Idaho sends its people, they're not sending their best."

11226,"Fact is: if you are in a first world nation, you could much easier lockdown compared to people in the poorer parts of the world."
11227,Distribution to the developed world first might not make sense in reducing the global death toll
11228,good news is now you have super antibodies for it an likely don't have to worry about getting it in the future.
11229,"What do you mean, the test positivity?"
11230,Or the percentage of the school population that has gotten sick?
11231,"The positivity will probably depend on whether screening tests are being done, and the participation rate -- higher screening participation will likely push down the positivity rate because more uninfected people will be participating in the tests."
11232,"Otherwise, it's only people who are already expressing symptoms or worried about exposure."

11234,I was wondering why so many are certain it will be out competed by delta.

11241,"Can’t read a street sign without my glasses but can read a menu, book, phone screen, etc like a boss!"
11242,Why is there still so much obsession with Dr. Fauci among the anti-vax/mask community?
11243,The guy makes like one public statement a week nowadays and it's mostly encouraging people to get vaccinated and stuff.
11244,"No idea why they think he's the champion of the ""new normal"" when there's literally *Zero Covid* internet communities that are dedicated to harassing pro-vaxxers that don't support masks or lockdowns enough."
11245,Fauci is easily a moderate on the hypothetical Covid sentiment spectrum.
11246,Just shows how much these people actually pay attention.
11247,It's not that they don't care what happens with family after they're dead or about dying.
11248,"It's that they're thinking that they personally will surely be fine, even if they get Covid, and they don't consider protecting others - only about their fear of the nasty vaccine."
11249,Life insurance takes all the above into account when issuing a policy
11250,I think you are right.
11251,"You know, while they are a very large and noisy minority, I'm getting really tired of them being permitted to decide how things will go for everyone."
11252,That's why I back sweeping vaccine mandates.
11253,[removed]
11254,What do the hospitals look like there?
11255,I guess what I'm saying is since NJ has a high vax rate are all the positive cases actually resulting in severe cases or are they just lots of mild cases as the vax takes care of business?
11256,[removed]
11257,[removed]
11258,I thought conservatives wanted less government oversight and more local or community centered decisions and this seems completely opposite of those values.
11259,Have you looked at a UK chart recently?
11260,"Cases didn't drop off as hard after the last wave as they did previously, they're still well above wave 1 peak numbers and they've been climbing for a month."
11261,Despite the fact that vaccination rates are going up.
11262,"My whole argument is the same as the article, Vaccinations are not enough, people will need to continue to do other things (Masking, distancing, etc.)"
11263,in order to keep this under control.

11265,"""stunningly stupid"" is right."
11266,I believe that had the most impact to the spike we are finally coming down from in Florida.
11267,"Once the CDC said vaccinated can unmask, everyone did."
11268,Even though only 50% had shots.
11269,Then came our Governor and took away local governments' ability to institute/enforce mitigation measures.
11270,Today he even threatened to fine local governments that require vaccines for their workers.
11271,There's no going back at this point.
11272,"Yeah, man."
11273,It’s getting OLD.
11274,I have a background in public health and even the “pro-science” posts are all twisted and warped now.
11275,I strongly suggest pretty much never taking the headline or article at face value because these journalists have no idea how to interpret data.
11276,[removed]
11277,Well this is madness.
11278,We straight up need to stop treating anti-vaxxers/maskers for COVID.
11279,Let them die in their home.

11281,Are your parents vaccinated?
11282,If everyone in your cluster is vaccinated you've taken a lot of potential issues off the table.
11283,"You haven't eliminated all of the danger, but you've done almost as much as you can."
11284,If you wanted even more 'protection' maybe discuss a booster with your primary care physician.
11285,So what does this mean for the Biden admins plan to start rollout boosters on the 20th of this month?
11286,Had my 3rd shot of Pfizer last week.
11287,For me it was between #1 and #2 in terms of effects.
11288,"shot 1, wasn't too bad, arm soreness, fatigue on day of and next day, but only after 5pm or so."
11289,"shot 2, same arm soreness, fatigue after 5pm on day 1, day 2 the fatigue had set in by 9:30am, day 3 the fatigue was less, but reminded me of that feeling you get after being sick where your body is still recovering, but you're feeling better."
11290,"shot 3, evening fatigue for days 1 and 2 only, although a 45 min nap helped both days, day 3 had a similar to shot #2 as far as feeling like I was recovering."
11291,&gt;significant mutations after crossing zoonotic barriers could mean that it can't cross back to humans.
11292,Not necessarily.
11293,The reason why it's so well suited to infecting a wide variety of animals is that it infects cells which have ACE2 Receptors.
11294,"Just about all mammals, birds, even some reptiles and amphibians have such cells."
11295,"As long as the virus still invades cells through that ACE2 receptor, then it can spread back into humans from other animals."
11296,"The danger is that other wild and even domesticated animals also are infected with an unknown quantity of other coronaviruses which may give SARS-2 some new genes that while causing no serious illness in it's animal hosts, can greatly increase the severity of the illness in humans."
11297,We've seen similar things happen with other viruses before.

11308,"They can wait until there are only a couple left to decide what to name them after next, especially if it's a premade list like the Hebrew Alphabet."
11309,"&gt; because of the asymptomatic transmission period

Can you give me some additional information on this?"
11310,"I was under the impression that asymptomatic transmission hasn't been observed, but it sounds like you might be talking about presymptomatic (or they mean they same thing, I don't know)."
11311,"This has been a hotly discussed item in my friend group, and I'm on the side that ""simply not being symptomatic doesn't give you a pass to do whatever"" because you can still be spreading."
11312,"Source 'against' Asmpytomatic Spread: https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/27/4/20-4576_article

&gt; In this cluster of COVID-19 cases, little to no transmission occurred from asymptomatic case-patients."
11313,Presymptomatic transmission was more frequent than symptomatic transmission.
11314,The serial interval was short; very short intervals occurred.
11315,&gt; The fact that we did not detect any laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 transmission from asymptomatic case-patients is in line with multiple studies (9–11).
11316,"However, Oran et al."
11317,have speculated that asymptomatic cases contribute to the rapid progression of the pandemic (12).
11318,"Some studies may be prone to misclassify presymptomatic cases as asymptomatic, leading to heterogeneous reporting of SAR of asymptomatic cases, because of different case definitions or differential duration of follow-up."
11319,In our study we used a very sensitive case definition for symptomatic cases that did not require specific symptoms (e.g.
11320,fever) to be present.
11321,"Also, timing of our study would have enabled detection of late onset of symptoms, which gives us confidence in our classification of exposure groups."
11322,"This is directly from the CDC...

WHO on the other hand (for asymptomatic spread) (https://www.who.int/vietnam/news/detail/14-07-2020-q-a-how-is-covid-19-transmitted)

&gt; Can people without symptoms transmit the virus?"
11323,"&gt; Yes, infected people can transmit the virus both when they have symptoms and when they don’t have symptoms."
11324,"This is why it is important that all people who are infected are identified by testing, isolated, and, depending on the severity of their disease, receive medical care."
11325,Even people confirmed to have COVID-19 but who do not have symptoms should be isolated to limit their contact with others.
11326,These measures break chains of transmission.
11327,"&gt; This is why it is always important to stay at least 1 metre from others, cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze with a bent elbow or tissue, clean hands regularly, and stay home if you become unwell or if asked."
11328,"In areas where there is widespread transmission, it is also important that people wear a fabric mask where physical distancing and other control measures cannot be implemented."
11329,Really interested in any additional studies.
11330,"&gt; But I have issues with insurance companies pulling benefits over people’s behavior

What exactly do you think insurance companies do?"
11331,It was like a major plot point of the movie Along Came Polly.
11332,Ok but what is a risk group?
11333,More than 40% of Americans are obese which seems to be the next-biggest risk factor after age and immunosuppression.
11334,Where is the cutoff?
11335,Yes.
11336,I would 100% go.
11337,"You're all vaccinated (and it's likely you'll all have boosters by Christmas too), it's been 2 years... to me, it would not be worth missing any more family time."
11338,"Planes and airports are very likely to stay under mask mandates until sometime in 2022 at the earliest which while not foolproof, is very helpful especially when combined with the vaccine."
11339,"Additionally, I think things are going to look very different by the holidays in terms of case counts - Delta can't just surge indefinitely."
11340,"My husband and I live far from our families too, and missed out on over a year and a half of family time."
11341,"Once we got vaccinated, we decided that we weren't going to miss out on any more."
11342,"Everyone's risk analysis looks different, but ours landed on the side of seeing family being an acceptable risk (I should note that all of our family is vaccinated)."
11343,"Probably, but not always..."
11344,The initial doses were both Pfizer.
11345,The booster is just a repeat shot of the Pfizer vaccine.
11346,My understanding is that this mRNA technology they're using for the covid vaccine is going to be useful for more potential cancer vaccines as well.
11347,Here's hoping...
11348,"Careful, man, there's a beverage here!"
11349,Oh man.
11350,Mine just bought plane tickets for thanksgiving for a week in a very crowded city.
11351,"They say they’re careful, but they really aren’t."
11352,"Aside from my ridiculously crowded public workplace, they are probably exposed to 15x as many people as me in any given week."
11353,"They’re both high risk and qualified for the booster as of late September, and they want to get it - if anyone will actually be administering it."
11354,It's good that cases are falling.

Yeah sorry, I’m never going to be “adaptable and open-minded” to antimaskers and antivaxers who are materially helping to make the pandemic worse."
11381,"That is speculative reasoning that seems like a rationale for their *actual* reason, which was mentioned by the scientists in the paper but was conspicuously left out of NBC's report."
11382,[CNN's article on the paper](https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/13/health/boosters-not-needed-lancet-review/index.html) does elaborate on the more important conclusion.
11383,"&gt;""The limited supply of these vaccines will save the most lives if made available to people who are at appreciable risk of serious disease and have not yet received any vaccine."
11384,"Even if some gain can ultimately be obtained from boosting, it will not outweigh the benefits of providing initial protection to the unvaccinated,"" the scientists write."
11385,"""If vaccines are deployed where they would do the most good, they could hasten the end of the pandemic by inhibiting further evolution of variants."""
11386,"Which is not unreasonable;  Why waste a limited vaccine supply on a use that may or may not actually make a difference, when we could be using that supply to make inoculation more widespread altogether and build up that herd immunity--something we definitely know will be impactful in the long run."
11387,"It’s actually 0.5% for full vaxxed -

11470,Seems reasonable to have a more nuanced view.
11471,I don't expect a 3rd dose of Pfizer's vaccine against wild-type will offer me much absolute additional protection against either hospitalization or death.
11472,Just continuing high-quality masking will be better.
11473,"But for the elderly and immunocompromised, there's perhaps a real benefit that rises above the noise."
11474,"And so long as governments (even in the US) are footing the bill for hospitalization, then there's probably an age and comorbidity threshold at which total projected costs are lower with boosters."
11475,"For Israel, 3rd shots were initially rolled out for those over 60."
11476,"I've been most disappointed that we're not seeing announced phase III trials with vaccines against the now dominant strains, like Delta."
11477,"Easy adaptation to new strains is supposedly one  of the benefits of mRNA vaccines, another being they don't provoke immune responses to adenovirus vectors that could impede boosters."
11478,"If we're going to live indefinitely with virus sloshing about our population (due to the opposition of many to NPIs), then I'd really like my booster to reflect the current dominant strain (s), as whatever immune evading future variant will most likely arise from this genetic background."

11495,"They got their first shots in early March, so it was pretty much a year of trying to keep them from taking stupid risks and realize how bad things were."
11496,"Well, they were pretty good until May, and then summer hit and they got tired of being so careful all the time, and my dad my dad says, he “doesn’t like to live in fear.” I saw them every week and they knew if they let slip something to me, I’d tell my siblings who’d get on the phone and all three of us would berate them."

11517,"From the article: 

&gt; No one knows exactly how many booster bandits are out there."
11518,The CDC estimated that more than 1 million Americans got an unauthorized third shot before the recommendations for immunocompromised people came out a month ago.
11519,"Since then, the agency has counted nearly 1.8 million people who have gotten an “additional” shot, **but it told me that there’s virtually no way to know how many of those actually went to folks with qualifying immune conditions, because patients only have to say they’re immunocompromised to get the jab**."

11580,"Yeah, there's definitely a reporting bias here."
11581,"Nobody hears about asymptomatic cases by their nature, and if we could, most people would probably feel pretty different about the danger out there."

11584,My kids can't get the vax yet.
11585,Yeah the first round for me may prevent me from winding up in the hospital but knowing I could still be a breakthrough case and laid up unable to take care of them at home or a spreader that brings it home to them means nothing changes.

11590,How are you holding up and do you think Auckland would go for another 4 weeks without seeing some protests?
11591,They really want to avoid getting this first strain of the virus.
11592,"Right now the virus is chewing through a population which still has a lot of completely immune-naive ""susceptible"" people in it."
11593,As the fraction of the population that is susceptible drops though the virus necessarily needs to optimize for transmission (which also increases virulence/lethality).
11594,This is similar to how the 1918 H1N1 pandemic got worse as time went on when it came to the pandemic strain.
11595,"Eventually though near enough to 100% of people will be vaccinated or recovered, and the game will change for the virus, and it will do better to try to achieve immune escape."
11596,This should come at a cost to fitness/transmissiblity/virulence as the collection of mutations that produce enough immune evation to start epidemics in recovered people will likely no longer be able to be optimal for transmission.
11597,"We can sort of see this now where there are more immune evasive strains out there like mu, but they're outcompeted by delta so far."
11598,This is similar to how the 1918 H1N1 pandemic strain eventually just became seasonal influenza (spreading every year until 1957 when it was displaced by H2N2).
11599,"So the point is to avoid getting infected by delta and give it another year or two, and then the endemic strains should carry less risk going forwards."
11600,By then we may also have better answers for the immune compromised.

11637,"Anyone else besides me absolutely sick of the unvaxxed who want to pretend things are whatever their conception of normal is, just dragging this all out indefinitely?"
11638,What are they gaining by playing around?
11639,"Covid may always be with us in some form, but when people who need a hospital can't even get treatment because of them, this has been going on long enough."
11640,The stupid are holding us hostage.
11641,Why would it be shocking?
11642,"I'm in my mid 30's and I got the vaccine as soon as I was able to (Approved in January, vaccinated in March), because I knew that because of my weight that I was in the high risk category."

11644,Thanks for the explanation!
11645,Good
11646,So you're saying he is more worried about keeping his office than doing what is right for his constituents.
11647,This right here sums up the problem with American politics.
11648,It’s going to interesting to see what happens this Friday at that booster shot meeting
11649,Yep.
11650,"A distant relative is on Facebook right now, asking people to pray for her sister after she took ivermectin shortly after catching COVID."
11651,"She got the scrip from a telehealth operation, and she is miserable."
11652,Both had been staunchly antivax.
11653,"The healthy sister is now asking for recommendations on ""the best vaccine."""
11654,It's a race to the bottom with this guy.
11655,He's trying to out- Trump Trump?
11656,"Well yea, that too"

11658,Whaaaat?
11659,"You mean a ""progressive"" sub has *regressive* views on science?"
11660,I still disagree even reading Jacob vs Mass that right rest solely with the states which is why each one has their own health department.
11661,Even if the bill passed I think it would get struck down by the courts.
11662,I’d love to hear from some constitutional law experts?
11663,I’m sure you could try to do something with the commerce clause but I think that’s what OSHA is doing.
11664,"I was being facetious, bc *there are so many deer here."
11665,*  But thanks for adding to my knowledge today!
11666,1.
11667,What vaccine ever had any kind of impact that far out.
11668,2.
11669,It has been a year.
11670,Trials were going on last year.
11671,Why aren't all the people part of those dropping dead or suffering from debilitating medical effects?
11672,"Florida, look, I know we make fun of you a lot, but can you please take care of this?"
11673,I agree mostly.
11674,"If the vaccinated are interacting with immune compromised people, they care about their ability to transmit."
11675,"In terms of fully healthy vaccinated people in isolation, I fully agree with you."
11676,This is why I think boosters should be made available to those that want them.
11677,"If the person is extra concerned about infection and transmission, they should be able to get boosters to have circulating antibodies rather than strictly B/T cell immunity."
11678,you’re a chomp 👍
11679,Yeah I can't imagine anyone could claim unemployment if they left due to their own foolishness.
11680,I haven’t seen any rapid testing that is free.
11681,And if the requirement is weekly testing you can’t really do the free tests that take up to 5 days for results.
11682,Shocking!!
11683,No wait.....what's that other word I'm thinking of....oh yeah extremely predictable.
11684,"He's got some money in Regeneron and their antibody treatment (ALSO UNDER EUA), one of the only things that can help you if you've chosen not to vaccinate."
11685,[removed]
11686,But I thought you were afraid of covid
11687,The pandemic has already been going for almost 2 years now.
11688,This is the kind of timescale we’re on with this.
11689,"Thinking too short term has led us to where we are, going back and forth with this shit."
11690,"If we want to end this, we need to COMMIT to the solutions."
11691,"For what it's worth, totally anecdotal I know."
11692,I work in a seriously conservative industry and  we were maybe 70% vaxxed until very recently when the final uber-conservatives' country clubs mandated they get the shot.
11693,"We're down to two holdouts, both of whom are mid 20's, super fit hyper-Vegan-lifestyle type people."
11694,One just got COVID last week.
11695,[removed]
11696,"
Given the rate at which unvaccinated idiots are dying vs vaccinated people, I’m personally laughing behind my mask every time I see some unmasked person."
11697,"I want them to congregate in large groups, I want them to be unmasked, I want them to take Ivermectin in large quantities, and would be willing to help pay for it."
11698,"At this point, they’re self-selecting out of the gene pool."
11699,All I want in return is an enforceable pledge that they not go to hospitals when they’re dying.
11700,And they’ll never give that…..so all the sick and injured will be unable to get care as Covidiots overwhelm the healthcare system yet again.
11701,What's everyone's current opinion on the US holidays coming up?
11702,I'm debating whether or not to see my parents for Christmas.
11703,However I'd be flying all the way across the country so I feel pretty anxious about it.
11704,"I'm vaccinated, however I have a higher risk of blood clots so I would be a higher risk than normal (but I don't think I'm deemed ""high risk"")."
11705,"I'd love to see my parents for the holidays as it will have been 2 years since I last saw them, and my mother recently had a really awful hospital scare."
11706,But I just....I don't know.
11707,Sad and preventable.
11708,"Quick note here - family member works in delivery at a large hospital - so far most staff are vaccinated - however, from what I gather, about 1 in 10 women who come in are positive for COVID and of those, something like 1/2 lose the child."
11709,"I know this is an unscientific second hand account, but her frustration was real."
11710,"That said, if it saves lives, I suppose having them leave may be the better option."
11711,I do feel bad for the other staff that will have to pick up.
11712,"On the flip side, in my city they are offering INSANE money to traveling nurses, I think I heard something like $8k to $12k a WEEK to help bridge the gulf between availability and demand, and they still don't have enough staff."
11713,This post appears to be about vaccines.

11742,You don't think there is capacity for mass vaccination campaigns in countries who have had mass vaccination campaigns more recently than the US?
11743,"It's not quite as easy, but it's a little messed up to think the rest of the world is full of ignorant people who can't figure out how to administer vaccines."
11744,"It isn't production of ""their"" vaccine."
11745,When you break a patent they aren't producing Moderna.
11746,They're producing a generic mRNA vaccine based on Moderna.
11747,Like when you buy CVS certirizine instead of Zyrtec.
11748,It's incredibly relevant that people are forced to buy vaccine from US suppliers in order to protect their own people.
11749,At a price they can't afford.
11750,"It's no wonder someone who makes a lot of money from the state of things as they are and who is a singular figure that creates vaccine distrust himself would be against something that would reduce donations to his organization, make it harder for him to generate goodwill for himself, would make the rest of the world less dependant on working through him and his network."

11767,"If you can do that by linking to a dictionary, that is probably far simpler than anything else."
11768,Saying this is prescritivism is like saying anyone who uses any reference material believes that material prescribes the way the world should be rather than describes it.
11769,"Yes, I can say ""I remember how the 2000 election turned out."""
11770,"But when speaking to another person who claims I am wrong, it is much simpler to cite wikipedia than to appeal to other people remembering as well."

11795,Fortunately there is not really any evolutionary pressure for the virus to mutate that way.

11797,I’m not saying they will marry and have a kid with both traits.
11798,I’m saying that both traits evolved naturally so it’s very much possible another variant evolves BOTH changes.
11799,Same way as some of changes seen on the delta variant were discovered in other variants
11800,7x more resistant then the wuhan type antibodies in cells prepared for the tests.
11801,There are things to consider with human immune systems..
11802,If infecting ability is increased but protection against hospitalization/icu/death remains the same then it hasn't change anything as far as those vaccinated are concerned.
11803,Good way to get those dangerous Trump stooges to get their shot and stop putting their neighbors and co-workers at risk.

11845,A few days shy of 6 months
11846,Talk to your doctor about doing a separate shot or two of Moderna or Pfizer on top of your J&amp;J.
11847,"There have been some reports that this may be better than a second shot of the same J&amp;J vaccine and is already the practice in some places, like San Francisco (though I believe they’re doing 1 shot of mRNA, not two, on top of J&amp;J)."
11848,My god…
11849,9x12 White Russians
11850,Yeah.
11851,This is… a weird way to frame it.

11854,"Im getting close to six months and was trying to decide if i should do a third shot of mod which was my original vaccine or go with two shots of pfizer spread a month apart, wonder if there is any studies for this?"
11855,Where are you getting the number of 13 million HIV Americans from?

11861,It's like being upset with somebody for not wearing a helmet on a motorcycle.
11862,It's foolish but if they want to roll the dice and risk spilling their brains out on the pavement Im certainly not going to get angry at them for it.
11863,I'm covered so the unvaccinated can do their thing as far as I'm concerned.
11864,"But we are talking about a variant, not Covid itself soo retry different"
11865,"I got my first dose just as Delta was starting to spread like wildfire in my country, so I always knew one does wouldn't give me much protection, but I definitely felt safer and more relaxed after the second dose."

11870,"I had fever, chills, uncontrollable shakes, nausea, muscle fatigue for several hours."
11871,Next morning I just felt like crap and stayed home from work.
11872,"Felt muscle soreness, nausea, and just overall body fatigue until later afternoon then was fine."
11873,Pfizer was second shot.
11874,"Felt very tired and body fatigued next day (like I had overextended myself on a run or something and ran myself empty), nauseous on and off."
11875,Pfizer as third shot just this past Friday.
11876,First time out of the three my arm felt really sore (like I had been punched hard in the arm).
11877,"Saturday I just felt muscle fatigue (especially in legs), very tired as in I don't even want to go to kitchen for water tired, splitting headache."
11878,Felt less tired Sunday but headache stuck around.

11897,Nope.
11898,Not as contagious as Delta.
11899,"Yeah, the problem isn't just COVID and misinformation, the distrust in the government existed way before."
11900,Though even if you don't trust the government it's quite obvious by now that the vaccines are safe.
11901,"Either way, I guess it's also true that at least with the mandate a few will cave in and take the vax to keep their job."
11902,"But there's also not much else the government can do about it, I'm afraid it will just have to be accepted that some will never get it no matter what the government or anyone does."

11904,For science: My mom got #3 of Moderna this past weekend on Saturday.
11905,She has SLE lupus and achondroplasia.

11907,Her arm is extremely sore and tender still.
11908,"She's been very tired, too."
11909,"Her arm has a big, red circle that looks like a raised spider bite at the injection site."
11910,The circle has become less red and spread over the rest of her arm since the injection.
11911,She was a walk-in at the pharmacy and she thinks they probably didn't defrost the serum completely.
11912,"While she had intense fevers after both of her previous shots, the reaction at the injection site was new."
11913,"Otherwise, she's now in good spirits and  fever free."
11914,She did it because she wants to be alive to see her grandbabies grow up.

11923,&gt;	Those deaths did not all happen over the weekend and go back over several days.
11924,Seems like a misleading headline
11925,Not an ethical dilemma for me when they are sitting unused in the US pharmacies.
11926,Those were never going to help other countries.
11927,"I remember when covid was on its way out, now almost 2 years later..."
11928,There isn't enough data to conclusively say if a booster is or is not helpful in populations who have already had two doses.
11929,However there is a *tremendous* amount of data that shows how helpful two shots are against current variants.
11930,Reducing overall global infections will help new variants from being created.
11931,The Lancet article states that distributing vaccines currently allocated for the United States (third dose) to populations with zero doses is a more efficient epidemiological strategy for combatting the virus.

11941,Thats not enough to keep delta in check.
11942,You should rather aim for 85.
11943,"Until this goal is reached, by either vaccination or by infection nonpharmaceutical means are still important, meaning masks, tracing app, fresh air, hand hygiene, distancing."

11946,"&gt;Just seven months ago, as the Covid vaccine was still being rolled out, the state was a [national](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/24/us/west-virginia-vaccine.html ""https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/24/us/west-virginia-vaccine.html"") leader."

11948,"&gt;But West Virginia has since fallen far behind, and its pandemic status has deteriorated, a situation shared with other states with large unvaccinated populations."
11949,"Just under 48 percent of West Virginia’s 18 and over population is fully vaccinated, the lowest of any state, [according to federal data](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/covid-19-vaccine-doses.html ""https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/covid-19-vaccine-doses.html"") compiled by The New York Times."

12161,So you're all fully vaccinated and you're worrying about a booster shot that neither the CDC or FDA currently recommend?
12162,I think you're overly worrying by quite a lot unless you have some extreme high risk condition.
12163,You could probably invade.
12164,"I bet they have oil, and there's only one way to find out!"

A couple of notes:   

1) Boosters not appropriate for ""general population"", high risk groups warrant further investigation."
12174,"2)  Given limited supply of doses, it is better for public health to increase initial doses before moving on to the boosters, because of the already excellent protection against serious disease offered by the initial doses."

12191,"If boosters were to be approved for all, the US government would need to buy extra doses from the labs."
12192,The current surplus is not enough to cover 150+ million boosters.
12193,Edit: To be clear.
12194,I agree with boosting up the inmunocompromised.
12195,I don't agree with boosters for all eligible.

12199,Hate to break it to you but that 25 is average *daily new* cases in Vermont.
12200,Active cases in Vermont is more like 500 per hundred thousand.
12201,CDC estimates there are 4 unreported cases per reported case.
12202,Vermont is getting hit less hard by delta variant.
12203,National average peaked at around 50/100k new cases per day this wave.
12204,Florida peaked at 100/100k.
12205,Vermont has 1.6 vaccine doses per person vs national average of 1.4 doses.

12210,case enter college.
12211,so im going to get a third one evendo the second one made me weak for weeks.
12212,"That was my personal experience, yes."
12213,Glad he made it - I was paranoid AF that I'd catch covid during my chemo.
12214,"Fortunately all cancer sufferers, chemotherapy has really come a long way and tends far less to total suckage than it used to."
12215,"Lymphoma is one of the more harsh ones - [Harvey Pekar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Pekar) had it and documented how much it sucked in [Our Cancer Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Cancer_Year], but that was 30+ years ago."
12216,"My oncologist was familiar with the comic and, aside from how my cancer was much less a rough one to treat, reported that someone with the same cancer today would have a much easier time."
12217,Yay science!
12218,Good point they definitely need to recognize this is about to get *a lot* worse as school opens and we head into the holidays.
12219,"Now isn't the time to be saying ""Oh, well, it's still 75-90% against severe disease, let's see what happens in a few months.""..."
12220,"No, those numbers are enough that seniors/high risk/frontline should get them *now*, and everyone else probably before thanksgiving."
12221,CMs
12222,That's true.
12223,A combined flu/Covid shot would make sense.
12224,It's currently unclear whether law is 100 or more in the same location or just with the same company.
12225,There's also a question if remote workers (which sounds like this entire company at the moment) will need to comply.
12226,In various studies between 10-88% of people who contracted covid had organ damage and/or long term disability.
12227,In one study of young patients with mild or no symptoms it was 70% but it seems the data all points to about 40% as the average number for all groups.
12228,We don't have data on if vaccination helps with this so I have to assume it doesn't.
12229,"I'm more concerned about, for example, developing a neurological disability or having ruined lungs for the next 50 years than I am of dying, personally."
12230,"If I die, I don't suspect I'll have much to say or feel about the subject."
12231,If I'm suddenly unable to do the things I do every day that will be devastating to me.
12232,"When someone is ""accepting the risk"" they're imposing that risk on me without my consent."
12233,I remember the movie Thank You for Smoking where the main character was explaining that he doesn't have to win the argument.
12234,All he has to do is make his opponent lose.
12235,I feel that the antivax movement see Fauci as an opponent they must portray as losing every time he speaks.
12236,He's living rent free in their heads and they will seek every opportunity to attack him.
12237,Just make covid-19 have state protections as an endangered virus species already.
12238,"Hell, make it the Florida Mascot already."
12239,What the hell does going ama mean?
12240,I am relatively young and very healthy and have no intention of getting a booster unless required.
12241,I'd much rather someone else get their first shot than I get my third.
12242,There has been no scientifically or medically proven need for it except for people in very high risk groups.
12243,If I had unvaccinated workers and worked at a company office I would do everything in my power to get them fired.
12244,Of course we’re bitter.

12248,The shots being sent to low income countries are not the shots being used for boosters right now.
12249,"If people don’t get boosters, these shots just get tossed."
12250,It’s not as simple as just chucking un-used vials of the vaccine in the mail.
12251,The US healthcare system is completely overrun.
12252,Most people don’t get time of work.
12253,"A mild case of covid is just one that doesn’t put you in the hospital- and for many, leaves people sick for weeks."
12254,Most people can’t afford to take weeks off work.
12255,"And then there’s millions upon millions of people immunocompromised, as well as the people around them."
12256,"When hospitals are overrun, avoiding infection entirely is necessary for people at high risk, as well as those that live with them."
12257,"There is no formal definition or proof of ""immunocompromised."""
12258,So if you say you are...
12259,"I have two aunts early 70s that refuse to get vaccinated, somehow."
12260,Not even a month ago i lost my other aunt (not due to covid).
12261,I'm afraid I will lose my other 2 aunts aswell.
12262,"Then there is the dad of my step sis, he's kidney transplant patient."
12263,They tested his blood and he has almost no antibodies even tho he is double vaxxed.
12264,"The man is fragile, but wise."
12265,I'm afraid I'll lose him too.
12266,"But due to his wisdom, I'm sure he'll be the last of the 3."
12267,I'll just make sure to enjoy the time with them to the best of my capabilities.
12268,Of course he did...that's some next level social distancing.
12269,Why the fuck were we given advice to take it after 3 weeks then?
12270,Where is the data supporting 12 week interval is better than 3 weeks?
12271,Can anyone logically explain why you would protest out the front of the hospital?
12272,This is BS.
12273,We are throwing them away.
12274,"If someone wants to get one, let them."

12312,She might get arrested.

12316,I wear a mask indoors or when it is crowded outdoors and we have 90% of adults vaccinated.

12324,"From what we've sequenced in the past few weeks, Delta is holding steady near 99% and Mu is 0.1% and has been decreasing (it was 3.7% mid-June)."
12325,Mu just has news right now because we've learned more about it than when it was new and we knew nothing.
12326,"Delta isn't really thought to be less lethal than other strains, it's either pretty close or a tad higher last I saw reported."
12327,But yeah I think as more people have Delta antibodies it will probably slow the other variants from getting a footing.
12328,"But that's not to say the ""let it rip"" strategy is in any way a good plan, lol."
12329,"If you are asking if Delta viral particle and a Mu viral particle can literally compete, like if I let a Delta patient and a Mu patient both cough directly into my mouth, I'm not sure what would happen."

12337,"As you point out the number of cases that are found also depends on the amount of testing, and when you test a lot you tend to find less severe cases (rather than someone showing up sick)."

12350,That certainly doesn't make the pandemic over.
12351,"In fact, it's making the opposite happen"
12352,I am vaccinated and I really don't care if (when) I get covid because continuing to live hiding from it is not viable.
12353,I wish everyone would get vaccinated and I support measures to get as many vaccinated as possible.
12354,"At the same time, I believe that they are making their choice and accepting the risk, so I refuse to let their decision affect my choice to return to a normal life."

12406,"For seniors, lower."
12407,"They didn't mention most of the lower number findings, only the Mayo Clinic study where they could criticize the wide CI, nor did they mention the CDC cited paper on seniors."
12408,"It's clear their definition of ""highly effective"" is subject to disagreement and not representative of the totality of the data."
12409,"At a *bare minimum*, there's more than adequate justification on the need and benefit for boosters for the elderly, those at high risk, and healthcare workers."
12410,Many people who are advised to take vaccines have a reduced immune response too due to cancer and other illnesses.
12411,"Aside from hospital workers, who may understand infection protocol but who also can’t really social distance from known Covid patients."
12412,"&gt; One of the important implications of the study, these experts say, is that the introduction of vaccines strongly correlates with a greater share of COVID hospital patients having mild or asymptomatic disease."

12470,Them getting vaccinated would make you safer.
12471,Possibly marginally but it's kind of an unknown.
12472,You’re 100% correct.
12473,"The subway line I take comes from the Bronx, and mask adherence is abysmal."
12474,Vaccinated people on the UES are more likely to wear a mask than unvaccinated people in the Bronx and Brooklyn.
12475,"The difference is that the poor democrats who don’t get the vaccine don’t scream on social media about it like the poor republicans do, even though they are believing similar conspiracy theories."
12476,I think people are not hearing the option for getting tested instead.
12477,And if they quit their job then they're going to have to go and find another company that either has less than 100 employees or is willing to flaunt the rules.
12478,"And when some large company that is flaunting the rules has an outbreak and people get the virus and feel that their workspace was unsafe and file a lawsuit, it'll be an even bigger problem for them."
12479,Companies have resisted other kinds of workplace safety measures over the years.
12480,"The end is simple in two large steps: 

1) Vaccine approval for kids 
2) Vaccine passport 
3) Enforcement of 2 

1 will happen, #2/3 is being done shittily everywhere except SF and NY and odds of it being done in widescale outside of that is low."
12481,"When the vaccines were first approved, there wasn't a lot of data comparing different intervals."
12482,The vaccines were approved based on a 3/4 week (pfizer/moderna) interval.
12483,"This was largely just to speed up approval, not because it was the ""perfect"" interval."
12484,"Once more data came out (well before the regular population in US could get vaccinated), more agile countries changed their interval to 10 or 12 weeks."
12485,"This had two great effects:  (1) Better immunity for the recipient, (2) Allowed supply to go towards first shots for more people ASAP."
12486,"First doses first (FDF) gets more people up to ~70%+ immunity and protection from severe illness, before bumping them up another 20-30% from the second shot."
12487,I got my 2nd shot after 12 weeks and had no side effects.
12488,"The 3 week interval is likely the cause of the extreme immune reaction too, and thus also the cause of myocarditis and other (relatively minor) side effects we're seeing from vaccination."
12489,The CDC is failing America by refusing to act on updated data swiftly.

12501,All vaccines have some risk.
12502,Extremely rare side effects that have largely been temporary for the few people effected are not enough reason.

12516,"""Those without a vaccine, for whatever reason, could feel ostracized, experts say"" 

That's... how it's supposed to work, what kind of messed up headline is that?"
12517,"Are they making some kind of guide for antivax, or to be just sorry for them?"
12518,"(Yes, I read the article, my complain is misleading headlines and quotes that creates doubt with vaccines, not encouraging them)"
12519,Right.
12520,They're screaming headlines that the third world countries need them first but seem to bury that boosters certainly make a difference.
12521,Thank you for your service :)

12525,"Working 

Yeah made me mad and confused as well 

Like go protest at the government office or something rather then stopping health care workers from helping people"
12526,I work for a big company that is mandating the vaccine.
12527,"We were already at an ~85% vaccination rate at the site I work at, though I'm still WFH."
12528,A small but very vocal minority are very very angry and planning on quitting.
12529,The policy is to be fully vaxxed by mid-November or be fired.
12530,"*Editing to say that there hasn't been mention of it being specifically due to the federal mandate, and that I have zero problem with them mandating vaccines"
12531,Delta is here.
12532,There is no reason it is ripping through the unvaccinated south and leaving the densest population unscathed other than vaccines and prior immunity.
12533,This thing is contagious as fuck.
12534,"It’s not suddenly going to be more contagious in NYC a month from now, especially given that more and more companies/state agencies are requiring vaccines."
12535,"It borders on magical thinking to believe boosters won't help with breakthroughs, and Israel has data showing the obvious outcome is in fact the actual outcome."
12536,"If you want to make an argument against boosters, fine, but don't do it by making fantastically unlikely claims bordering on magic."
12537,They need to again adhere to the [Swiss Cheese Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_cheese_model#/media/File:SwissCheese_Respiratory_Virus_Interventions-ver3.0.png) instead of depending entirely on a perfect single intervention method.

12540,!
12541,"So I got Pfizer first and second shots, then I got a Moderna booster 4.5 months after 2nd Pfizer."
12542,I had no side effects from first Pfizer shot.
12543,"I had chills, body aches, and a fever for less than 24 hours from second Pfizer shot."
12544,The Moderna shot gave me chills and body aches (but no fever) for less than 24 hours.

12546,But with this new ruling - 85+ seem realistic .

12548,His tumor was a fucking decimeter!
12549,?
12550,Punish them for what?
12551,If you look at the New York Times they have a different perspective.
12552,"The amount of new cases in Vermont was 180 reported on September 12

It is a seven day average of 26 per hundred thousand people which is much higher than New York City which for the same seven day period is 16."
12553,Just read the Times.
12554,I wish no ill will on Vermont they are one of the highest vaccinated states and they deserve credit for it.
12555,"If you go to the “choose your own places to track” you can see the difference between say Vermont and New York City or New York state overall which is 23 per hundred thousand 

I was simply wondering why they have a higher seven day average when they are so vaccinated."
12556,I’m not making accusations I was just wondering
12557,"Well, how about the unvaccinated people are taking away the freedoms of the vaccinated?"

12566,Some had some lasting symptoms that seems to have dissipated but lingered for months after being infected.
12567,"Again, at my workplace, no one who has had a breakthrough infection has reported anything beyond mild flu or cold symptoms."

12576,My mom has cancer and we've tried to b careful since we don't know how effective her vaccination was and stories like this are why I'm so scared to get her sick.
12577,"I just don't know if she would make it even after vaccination, you know?"
12578,An excellent example of selection bias.
12579,All of the people that got an actual mild breakthrough case didn't take the time to tweet about it so you never hear from them.

12596,They make it sound reasonable by downplaying the strength and degree of evidence on how much effectiveness dropped in July.
12597,They make no mention of several data sources that back the Mayo Clinic number but do complain about the wide CI.
12598,The make no mention of the CDC cited study showing the elderly were significantly below the rosier studies.
12599,"And most significantly, they keep using extremely vague language and never mention what level of effectiveness they mean when they say 'data shows it's still highly effective'."
12600,"If they cited all the available data, and gave the numbers... their conclusion would be *far* weaker, especially because they didn't even attempt to quantify the benefit... given current production levels, if we withheld boosters, how much faster could the world get vaccinated?"
12601,"In the US, Pfizer and Moderna have productions numbers such that the answer is a month or less, for our exports alone."
12602,"Their misrepresentations, and how strongly everyone is going to have to disagree, is already fueling the antivax and ivermectin lunatics, who want to pretend the disagreement here is comparable to how they disagree... **it's not**."
12603,"Numerous credible authorities are disagreeing here, not fringe wackadoos."
12604,Well it's one of the most well recognized spokespeople and now has the distinction of working closely with two administrations.
12605,"And he says and does things that are, in my opinion, response-worthy."
12606,"Like randomly starting to wear two masks because it is ""common sense"", or using different numbers for herd immunity at different times depending on who he is talking to."
12607,I think his heart is in the right place but he's been inconsistent and mixed just like everyone else trying to provide guidance.
12608,"The person I responded to seemed to think that the reasoning behind their advice didn’t include the potential risks at all, even though it’s clearly stated."
12609,Because free vaccines have been widely available for months.
12610,Anyone who has not been vaccinated by now has done so willingly.
12611,Protect those who have protected themselves first.
12612,"If the vaccines run out before some anti-vax whack job has a chance to reconsider, well that’s too bad; but it’s on them."
12613,I’m sick of having my health ruled by the lowest common denominator.
12614,"As someone who got the J&amp;J, I concur"
12615,"The Israeli data (at this point, on millions of booster shots administered) shows that the vast majority (~80%) do not have worse side effects than their 2nd dose."
12616,"Personally, I had pretty intense side effects from all my doses, but my 3rd dose was closer to my 1st."
12617,Extremely happy to have gotten my booster.
12618,Israeli data shows that it boosts protection by **11x** and brings efficacy of the vaccine back up to 95% against Delta.

“But as children are at such low risk from the virus, the JCVI decided that vaccination would offer only ""marginal gain"" and, therefore, there was ""insufficient"" evidence to offer mass vaccination to this age group.”"

12761,Restaurants and bars are packed.
12762,The only thing that I would say has changed from earlier in the summer is more people wearing masks inside of shops and stores but even there it’s a mix.
12763,"Most counties in this area are ~60%+ fully vaccinated, lots of stuff has been permanently moved outdoors (outdoor dining everywhere, ordering coffee from a walk up window instead of going in, etc), and places know the importance of ventilation so you’ll see lots of doors/windows propped open as you go in and out of places."
12764,Plus a high percentage of people with jobs that can be remote helps.
12765,[removed]
12766,So we are something around 84% of people had Covid or at least one vaccine… shouldn’t we be at herd immunity levels now?
12767,This sounds good on paper but it requires enforcement.
12768,"In the US a lot of businesses will just refuse to enforce it or even if they want to, employees won't want to deal with idiots that argue with them."
12769,"From what I've heard from a colleague who lives there, it's not as bad as the US but they do have plenty of anti mask, anti lockdowns, anti vax protests as well."
12770,Were they masked?
12771,cuz...
12772,Damn.
12773,"TLDR:

&gt; A man who completed 21 days of mandatory quarantine upon returning to China from overseas has been identified as the likely source of a new outbreak

&gt; He had tested negative for the virus nine times during 21 days of quarantine, before testing positive on Friday -- 37 days after entering China

&gt; The fresh outbreak in Fujian province on China's southeastern coast has infected more than 60 people, including 15 elementary school pupils"
12774,I wonder if COVID could eventually evolve into a strain our immune system just can't fight?
12775,&gt; I thought it was due to the FDA asking Pfizer and Moderna to enroll more children in the trials to rule out rare side effects.
12776,"You are correct, but the FDA dropped the ball here when they did that."

12823,I’ve decided not to pay too much attention to Israel on covid/vaccine developments.
12824,"They seem to be largely be an outlier on everything, and their refusal to release any meaningful data to anyone outside of the company that profits off of giving out as many doses as possible leaves me a little skeptical."
12825,"Covid could and does recur, it offers short term immunity, same as other Coronaviruses."
12826,At the beginning last year there was some hopium belief that it was like measles and getting it once was forever immunity.
12827,[deleted]
12828,"But it’s not antibody resistant, I feel that’s too far of an overstatement, the bodies immune system still recognizes it, it will still attack it, so it’s not like it’s at novel stage anymore"
12829,No one ever said that masks themselves were ineffective against COVID.
12830,"However, there was indeed a time when *widespread* *mask* *usage* was detrimental from a public health perspective (because of the PPE shortage, masks had to be exclusive for healthcare workers)."
12831,There has been no backpedaling.
12832,I would like to see a breakdown of long-haul COVID results by country.
12833,"Reason being is that Americans have this need to work through sickness and ""tough it out""."
12834,"You see it HCA awards where people keep trying to do chores or, God forbid, they go outside the house."
12835,"Compare this to, say Sweden, who is very accommodating to work from home and very cognizant about resting when sick."
12836,"Had friends who wouldn't go out because they ""were feeling a bit off""."
12837,"It may be nothing, but considering anything beyond resting puts at least minimal strain on the lungs, it could create more issues."
12838,"Mine are in their 60’s too - they have enough risks that their doc approved a 3rd Moderna shot late this month, six months after their last dose."
12839,They just have to sign a form stating they’re in the high risk category when they get the shot.

12841,Enlighten me darling
12842,Depends.
12843,HIV falls into this category and it's still with us.
12844,No idea.
12845,Still far less screwed than the morons who haven’t gotten any vaccine.
12846,It’s a vira vector vaccine ao it uses a weak adenovirus to make your cells create some specific proteins from the virus and trains your immune system to knock them out.
12847,You’ll be fine most likely.
12848,His comment is essentially correct.
12849,The behavior of those who refuse to get the vaccine has been manifestly poor.
12850,"I have yet to see an interview with any anti-mask or anti-vax individuals that doesn't quickly devolve into ""my freedom"" or ""those pushing mandates are dangerous"" to ""vaccines are a conspiracy."""
12851,"The vaccines are safe, mandates of vaccination, masking, and other effective treatments have defeated deadly and dangerous pandemics, and have been practiced for centuries."
12852,"While I know I have been one to post my anger at the unvaccinated, it is an objective fact that their behavior has lead to many becoming sick, and yes many dying."
12853,There is data the covid survives have increased impotance rates
12854,That's just wrong.
12855,Excess food is not a health risk in and of itself.
12856,Some athletes need thousands of calories more than the average person during training/etc; you're conflating eating a lot with obesity.
12857,"Obesity can certainly be caused by eating too much, but there are many other factors that go into obesity."
12858,I agree that people need to make better choices when it comes to eating.
12859,But that's more complex an issue than you're making it out to be.
12860,"I eat clean/work out, I'm leaner than probably 90% of people on this planet, but I have the luxury to do that."
12861,"I wouldn't expect most people to have the knowledge or interest in following similar diets, especially when there is such a behemoth of corporate marketing with decades of sophistication to fight against everywhere you turn, from television advertising, nutritional (mis)information, to simply buying food at a grocery store."
12862,"The way advertising and the physical placement of items on shelves are all planned to hijack the programming of the human brain, and it's not as easy as ""well just buy healthier food!"""
12863,"For some people perhaps it is, and others do their best, but your view on it is quite reductive."
12864,"That being said, yes, people in the US are unhealthy."
12865,Does that mean insurance premiums should go up for them?
12866,"No, because the healthcare system in the US is broken/dum af and not as easily parsed as ""fat people don't take care of themselves so they should pay more""."
12867,"But if Mu is antibody resistant, then it’s not really in competition…?"
12868,So there is widespread loathing from nurses that doctors don’t value their opinions?
12869,I think I found the problem.
12870,I wear a different brand but I just googled around for the best price.
12871,I ordered from [Coastal](https://www.coastal.com/contact-lenses)l and am totally satisfied.
12872,"I ordered in January when they had 15% off and free shipping, so got a year's worth for something like $115 instead of over 300 locally."
12873,"I bet they run that special every year, but I also get $15 off deals offered regularly and I want to say they have a good new-customer discount as well."
12874,They answered my email really quick and were very nice too.
12875,Had almost 2 years to invest in expanding healthcare and hospitals.
12876,Being overrun is almost by choice now.
12877,Natural selection probably won't favor that situation.
12878,"A virus that kills faster than it infects will ""burn out"" and would be ineffective at spreading."
12879,Sloppy seconds baby.
12880,This just happened to my 2nd grader and kindergartener.
12881,"My husband, who was already very skeptical about sending them, is even more concerned now that they caught a cold despite masks and precautions."
12882,He has asked me how I think they are “safe” from covid if they are not even safe from a cold.
12883,I've gone on two flights this year.
12884,There are multiple signs and messages airlines/airports provide you ahead of time.
12885,Delta even has a 3 point questionnaire about covid guidelines and precautions.
12886,"In reality, this man was given plenty of context clues and warnings before even boarding."
12887,He would be a terrible detective.
12888,Ya.
12889,I max it out before I even do my 401(k).
12890,It’s too bad more people aren’t able to do it.
12891,Or understand it.
12892,It’s a bit of a bummer because the insurance reps who can tell you the difference between the insurance policies aren’t allowed to give “tax advice” (unless they happen to also be tax advisors) so people rarely get the whole picture explained to them during enrollment time.
12893,"With all other things being equal, but it is too deadly, the infected do not have as much of a chance to spread it so the virus dies out because it runs out of hosts."
12894,Edit: I guess this also assumes that you would get so much more sick that the you wouldn't be out and about for two week.
12895,Did he get the vaccine now?!
12896,Please tell me he did or is planning to.
12897,Is it a bribe though?
12898,Many states tried literal bribes with limited success.
12899,This is more punishment avoidance.
12900,"Yeah, if it’s resistant to antibodies, I don’t see how it would have to out-compete Delta."
12901,"I think people getting seriously ill and/or dying is scaring some people straight (at least anecdotally in my life), but sadly it's taking seeing it up close and personal for people to realize."
12902,"Latest friend of a friend in hospital on vent: 27-year old healthcare worker, mom of two kids, unvaccinated."
12903,Completely preventable.
12904,Fucked up.
12905,"What really gets me is how all of these unvaccinated people are fine trusting medical technology and expertise in every other instance, but somehow a lifesaving vaccine is too scary."

12949,This was a point brought up at my university’s last covid briefing - that surveillance testing is just not worth the effort in the age of vaccines and the Delta variant.
12950,"Bc Delta spreads so fast, a negative test could end up providing a false sense of reassurance to the person and those around them."
12951,"Which is funny because in the time they spent watching some nutjob video, they could have watched a 10 min video of what it's like to be an ICU nurse during covid."
12952,Being from Australia a third option seems the most likely - caught it in quarantine.
12953,"It's between the lines here:

&gt;Chinese authorities did not reveal when, where or how the man caught the virus, but an incubation period longer than 21 days is highly unusual."

12962,"13,I think verses 48 and 49."
12963,"yeah, because Delta has higher R (around 6)
  
worst case scenario is, when Delta has already burn out, immunity from those who has recovered from Delta only partially neutralize Mu variant.. and Mu would be the dominant variant..
  
now let's look back at July.. you said Mu has 2% prevalence in July.. but in 12 July, the 7 days average Covid case in USA is around 30k cases a day..
  
compare that to 12 September where the 7 days average is around 150k
  
2% from 30k is 600  
1% from 150k is 1500
  
Delta outcompete Mu variant, but did not exactly crush it..

12979,"I think the battlegrounds are now drawn around ""severe disease""."
12980,"It's just my humble opinion, but I think this battle between some scientists and administration is quite unfair to the people."
12981,There are no thorough credible CDC lead studies on long COVID in the vaccinated who don't end up in the hospital.
12982,AFAIK they can't even define what constitutes long COVID.
12983,"I know there are random studies here and there, all with different conclusions, and plenty of anecdotal evidence all over the place."
12984,If you want me to accept the chance of getting COVID (when boosters are clearly available) you have to convince me that it's in **my** best interest.

12991,"Mask mandates, travel restrictions, and distancing for the vaccinated does nothing to stop spread (only delay its inevitability) and eats up a huge amount of attention in the media, making the push for vaccines more difficult to focus on."
12992,"Has anyone noticed that there has been a flurry of articles in the past week saying basically the same thing, that we need to realign our expectations on what ""control"" of this pandemic means?"

13002,"I’m honestly surprised by this, as my they have been restrictive throughout the past year - they even cancelled our commencement when there were plenty of ways to do it safely outside."
13003,"I just hope that even if the university implements mandatory testing, that the administration and professors will know that raw cases are not the best metric now that we have a vaccine and almost everyone’s gotten it, and won’t overreact to case counts."

13212,"I think that's what makes it possible for the deadliness to go either way -- the spread of Covid happens well before people feel their sickest, or die."
13213,So there is little or no selection pressure on virulence.
13214,Genuine question: I wonder if these contacts are then lab-confirmed to have actually been linked?
13215,"Cuz otherwise it could be a case of correlation does not equal causation: two infected people brushing past each other, but they actually got their infections elsewhere and independently, likely from asymptomatic individuals."

13689,Luckily the school had free rapid tests for kids so the kids tested clean and I assumed I had what they had.
13690,We’re all still alive
13691,This post appears to be about vaccines.

13694,*
13695,Are you in the US?
13696,How did you get your third does?
13697,"Instead of wasting shots on 3rd, 4th, 5th boosters for rich countries, how about sending those to poorer countries that havent even gotten their people their first shots yet?"
13698,Those places are variant breeding grounds.
13699,The pandemic isnt over until the rest of the world is able to be vaccinated too.
13700,Stop hoarding vaccines in wealthy countries.
13701,"He's recounting his own personal experience with two diseases that he's had that, presumably, you have not."
13702,"He doesn't owe you or anyone else ""quality control"" on his thoughts about the matter."
13703,"This isn't a ""bad take"" because it's not a ""take"" at all."
13704,There's no need to judge it as such.
13705,Yeah either a smaller company or one that's run by someone with similar ideology to them and is defying the mandate.
13706,My feeling is some people are really crazy in their opposition to the vaccine and as I said if they haven't taken it so far because they think the government wants to harm them or something the same government mandating it is likely to anger them more.
13707,The second jab of Moderna left me tired and achy for a day.
13708,The third jab was the same except I had some swelling and tenderness in my axillary lymph nodes on the side I got the shot.
13709,My booster was on a Friday and the tenderness persisted through the following Tuesday.
13710,"Funny their ""freedom and dignity"" worth less than $200."
13711,I live in Austria/Vienna we get up to 4 PCR tests per week for free.

13713,US peeps might call it communism :D
13714,"""Meltu,"" as in meltu face off"
13715,I fucking hate thinking about rabies.
13716,I'm neurotic so I tend to think worst case scenario every time.
13717,Something maybe bit me on the arm wednesday morning while i was sleeping.
13718,"I wake up because there's a spot on my arm that hurts like my hair's being pulled.. but it's raised like a zit, hard like a zit, not pink at all.. so did something bite me or did i lay my arm down on a zit i didn't know about?"
13719,No bite marks or anything that i could see.
13720,"Next morning the bump is gone but i had squeezed it in the middle of the night thinking it might've been a zit so i've got two scabs now, almost certainly done by my fingernails, but i'm still freaking out a little bit because .. what if it was a bat?"
13721,"The window was slightly open because the A/C vent cover fell open a bit but the screen was behind it.. so a rabid bat would've first had to get around the screen and through the hole, bit me then leave the same way because the motion sensors on cameras inside my apartment didn't pick up any movement in the living room/kitchen/dining room (I have two cameras - one facing the door and one facing down the hall, that i got because there was a sudden crime spree in my building)."
13722,"The whole thing is incredibly improbable - i checked around my bedroom to see if there were any visitors and there's nothing dead or alive in there, and the odds that a confused bat would find its way in and out through the same gauntlet are very very very low."
13723,"But I still can't help but worry a bit about it, being neurotic."
13724,I saw on the NC Dashboard that hospitalizations were down statewide by about 250 and became hopeful.
13725,"Then I saw only 91% of hospitals reporting, 172 deaths over the weekend, and this article."
13726,Nvm.
13727,"The other company is a military school that currently has an indoor mask requirement in place, so I think she's probably just out of luck regardless lol"
13728,Third of the original.

13730,"Pifzer: The booster shots are appropriate, at least for us."
13731,"Yeah, well, that's just like his opinion, man."
13732,Yeah think things might really start improving pretty quick moving forward.
13733,Reproduction rates are below 1.0 in like 40 something states now.
13734,Case declines always follow suite.
13735,https://covidestim.org
13736,First two shots gave me a sore arm for the day.
13737,3rd shot had the sore arm last for two days
13738,"I may be completely wrong here, but to me it feels like they're boosting the vaccinated to reduce the cases from those because they don't vaccinate the unvaccinated :/ I mean at this point make it mandatory."
13739,"Israel ([ourworldindata.org](https://ourworldindata.org)) seems to have 68% (1 dose) and 63% (2 doses) of the population vaccinated, they started real fast but now their vaccination rate doesn't look impressive at all."
13740,Unless 37% of the population is younger than 16 (?)
13741,it means lots of people are not vaccinated yet.
13742,[removed]
13743,It's because the OSHA policy hasn't actually been written/distributed yet.
13744,It's a large company.
13745,Quit and go where?
13746,A smaller company?
13747,That's pretty much your only option.
13748,You probably are not going to make as much money at a smaller option.
13749,The legal battles that will no doubt ensue are going to be interesting.
13750,Biden seems well within his rights as far as federal workers and people who work with the feds go.
13751,I'm not sure about the OSHA rule so that will be fun to watch get hashed out.
13752,[removed]
13753,[deleted]
13754,I had no side effects for my first and third shot.
13755,I was pretty tired after my second.
13756,Because if it was free then poor people could get it and they can't have the same things as me.
13757,So I need to pay for it so that poor people can't get it and somehow that makes me better than them.
13758,"The CDC estimates that about 35,000 people a year (in the US) die from the flu and I don't think we're going to have nearly that many breakthru covid deaths."

13760,What did I just read?
13761,This is several weeks old.
13762,damn i didn't know jeff bridges had cancer
13763,Maybe the company is openly defying the mandate in the hope that the Supreme Court will strike it down or something.
13764,[removed]
13765,"I know that the matching was done with sequencing (Australia is totally on the ball with that), I'm just skeptical of the 100% perfect knowledge of two people's proximity at all times for 2 weeks."
13766,I can hardly trace my whereabouts 3 days ago.
13767,Another possibility I thought of is one thing the US CDC provided information about -- multiple shorter exposure events in a 24 hr period leading to an infection.
13768,"The sequencing might match these two people, but can it rule out an additional exposure?"
13769,So explain to me how the same percentage of people in the study I linked ended up in the hospital as a percentage of cases.
13770,It's not like it was a small sample size.
13771,"For the visual learners:

13773,We actually did that with the Polio vaccine.
13774,Yeah I'm probably worried about infecting older people in my family than myself really.
13775,But from what I understand it is quite unlikely for a vaccinated person to infect another vaccinated person.
13776,My boss mentioned it in our morning meeting last Friday.
13777,"He basically said, ""Yeah, we have more than 100 employees, so it will likely apply to us."""
13778,"One of my coworkers is anti-vax and immediately said, ""I'm glad I have an interview lined up at another company next week!"""
13779,I did't bother to point out to her that the other company also has over 100 employees...she'll figure it out.

13789,"If there's room for you, that's a storm you can easily weather, a worst-case scenario that's bad but not catastrophic."
13790,"But if they're overcrowded and they have to push someone who might die out of a bed to make room for you, or if you take up space that some kid with appendicitis needs, well, that's a line I draw, myself."
13791,I won't risk that.
13792,"But again, the odds of that are really low; if you're vaccinated and middle aged or younger, and you have no obvious pre-existing conditions, the pandemic is effectively over for you."
13793,If a company doesn't know it has 100 people there's something very wrong with their HR dept.

13815,The messaging around COVID is so screwed up and it's like kids don't even exist.

13819,"One good sign of hope is that a hospital in Orlando has raised its status from black (the worst level), to red and then yellow a week later."

13823,That’s found to be extremely rare not just with covid but with most viruses as per competition exclusion principle.
13824,This has been pretty well studied.
13825,There’s even research to creating viruses that could be used to harmlessly compete with something like covid to essentially smother them out of existence.

13836,"“Anyone, including young athletes, could experience a severe case or have long-term damage, which is why it’s so important to take this seriously.”

&gt; This is especially true with active individuals, as it can be difficult to tell what long-term effects someone is going to have after they recover from the virus."

13866,"(Example: Someone with covid-19 dies in a car crash =&gt; Covid-19 death counter +1)

In Bavaria 88% of the deaths are due to Covid-19 - 12% of the deaths involved Covid-19 (date of report dd.mm.yyyy - 20.11.2020)

Italy had a similar report: 89% due to Covid-19 - 11% involved Covid-19 (date of report dd.mm.yyyy - 16.07.2020)

We are currently at around 4550000 deaths involving Covid-19 and at around ~4.1 million deaths due to Covid-19."
13867,In the United States is because the federal government can not enforce a vaccine mandate or force people to vaccinate.

13877,"We spend a lot of time talking about ""risk tolerance"" and stuff like that but then we specifically seem to be going out of our way to make it impossible for anyone that has a risk tolerance any lower than ""pretend it is 2019"" to take reasonable steps to lessen their risk during the middle of a huge wave of infections."

13882,"No variant has (or likely will) completely neutralized all natural antibodies, but sometimes a previous infected person's antibodies will decline quickly and we don't always know why, so people like that may be completely unprotected."
13883,"If you keep your antibodies, though, I believe* that if you've been infected by a [variant that is closer in lineage](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/gisaid/global) to the new one, then you're better protected against it because it will behave and attach to your cells similarly to what your body has already seen in its prior infection."
13884,"There are tons of variants in existence right now but many are super similar or haven't quite gotten every number on their lottery ticket just right so they haven't earned the VOI, VOC, or VOHC designation."
13885,It's a huge evolutionary balancing act that determines whether one will be more transmissible AND severe AND evasive.

13953,"Actually, the maskless behavior exhibited by the unvaccinated, makes this scenario much more plausible."
13954,"&gt; If your vaccination rate is at 80%, and your R0 is still above 1, it doesn't matter if you only have 7 ICU cases today, you're going to have 1000 in a couple of months because that's how this works."
13955,This was your argument.
13956,"You do realize that Singaporeans are likely to be the ones taking the most precautions even if restrictions are lifted, right?"
13957,"Also, this argument is literally untrue."
13958,Look at the UK and Denmark - why do you somehow think Singapore will follow a different trajectory despite having similar or higher vaccination rates?
13959,Thank God for cannabis!
13960,Good to hear others here agree with this.
13961,"It's so frustrating to think that in May we were talking about mask rollbacks, implemented them in June and literally in July started to see the problems with this approach due to Delta."
13962,We still in many places haven't brought it back.
13963,It's all up to local govts.
13964,The foot has already been shot multiple times.
13965,Does anyone really think that the booster numbers are going to be anywhere near the number of people we have already gotten vaccinated?
13966,"All of this dithering, shaming and mandate threatening has likely created a whole new population of anti-boosters - people who were vaxxed the first time and are sick the mixed messages, incorrect information and the elitist shaming that has gone on for the last few months."
13967,Seniors and high risk people getting boosters will probably be close to the first and second round numbers.
13968,Younger age groups will probably resist boosters at a much higher rate than we see with the current mix of populations who are not getting vaccinated.
13969,Instructions unclear- got a 3rd shot.
13970,Based on things I’m seeing out of FDA and the reasons for the lack of requirements or guidance are because a 3rd does is not needed.
13971,"Apparently the fact that the White House got our head caused two of the FDA approval folks to retire 

Here is a great article linking to the Lancet data https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/13/covid-booster-shots-data-shows-third-shots-not-appropriate-at-this-time-scientists-conclude.html"
13972,Same.
13973,As well as (probably) much less chance of spreading to others for at least 6 months.
13974,Give me my booster now.
13975,[removed]
13976,Huh?
13977,The worst state is Mississippi and they are currently at 57% for 12 and over with one shot.
13978,This is dumb
13979,"oh c'mon Atlantic

this is so stupid"
13980,[removed]
13981,cuz they milk my insurance UGHHH like why am i paying $600 a month for crap other countries have free and cheaper stuff
13982,But isn't part of the problem in Britain that they don't have enough vaccines for the under-40 demographic?
13983,"Well there is really no hard scientific case for it, except for certain people in very high risk groups."
13984,"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02158-6

&gt; But scientists say that the case for COVID-19 vaccine boosters at this point is weak."
13985,"They might not be necessary for most people, and could divert much-needed doses away from others."
13986,"On 4 August, the World Health Organization called for a moratorium on boosters until at least the end of September."
13987,"“Wasting resources on boosters for those who are already protected against severe disease does not really make too much sense,” says Laith Jamal Abu-Raddad, an infectious-disease epidemiologist at Weill Cornell Medicine—Qatar in Doha."
13988,"“Down the line, probably, we would need to think of it."
13989,"But really, we don’t have strong arguments for it right now.”"
13990,I may be unclear in my description.
13991,I mean case rate.
13992,And I mean one of the largest public school systems in the country.
13993,"200,000 students/teachers/staff."
13994,It's a question whether you want to be unprotected / have limitation regarding where you can go for another 9 weeks.
13995,"Though 12 weeks could be better in long term, that means the whole vaccination progress would be delayed for at least another 9 weeks, which could means more cases / deaths beginning of this year."
13996,There's one in the responses.
13997,I can't imagine the frustration if that were my county.
13998,Mine is 56% and I'm still mad at us.
13999,If they didn't defrost completely - that sucks.
14000,"When we have someone walk in first thing in the morning way before covid appointments are starting, and in turn way before Moderna is defrosted and ready, we tell them we're more than happy to give it, but they have to wait for it to defrost."
14001,And 100% of people so far have been fine to wait.
14002,Maybe they just poorly managed their defrosted supply going through the day but don't punish someone trying to stay healthy by doing that to them  :(
14003,Exactly.
14004,It's just not worth the largely-avoidable risk.
14005,I mean it's a good question and more people should probably ask this question or at least think about it before demanding that everyone wear masks.
14006,"The original idea was to prevent droplets from leaving your mouth and nose and getting to other people, so like protecting other people from you."
14007,"If people think that a loose, paper mask that goes on their face with big gaps all around will protect them from an airborne pathogen that is probably not realistic."
14008,"99% of masks that people wear are useless in this regard, especially if they keep taking them off."
14009,A real close-fitting medical mask would provide this kind of protection but this isn't what people are doing.
14010,If you ever wondered what climate change is going to ravage first look for the places insurance companies (without massive federal guarantees) have stopped providing coverage.
14011,"They have no reason to deny it's happening, just have to plan for the reality of it."
14012,That’s great!
14013,He recovered fairly quickly!
14014,"We're definitely in a movie, right?"
14015,This is insane.
14016,It can very much be deadly.
14017,Lots of sick and dying kids.
14018,"Not as many as adults, but still."
14019,[removed]
14020,It's their entire job to use the best available data to forecast specific trends in the future.
14021,The insurance companies then hedge their bets against those trends to provide a level of coverage that hopefully won't bankrupt them.
14022,There’s a narrative being pushed.
14023,Sorry you're getting so much hate on your comment.
14024,"I had a friend who had a bad reaction to the first Pfizer shot, but was medically cleared to get J&amp;J as his second shot some time later."
14025,"If you have concerns, that's something you could look into."
14026,"I don't know where you live, but if you don't have a doctor, you could ask a doctor at one of those public vaccine tents if you're in the neighborhood anyway, see what they recommend for someone with your medical history."
14027,Usually they're not too busy and have gotten much weirder questions.
14028,"Yeah I just don’t get it, i feel this subs just filled with introverts."
14029,"I’ve been to florida in June, and went to Hawaii for my honey moon."
14030,"I’ve accepted that I’ll get Covid eventually, and I’m okay with it, the vaccine is highly effective against severe and hospitalization."
14031,When I get Covid it’ll probably onky last a few days.
14032,"I’m okay with this, cuz I’m tired of it all."
14033,I work for a company that’s very large and a federal contractor as well.
14034,Got an email Friday saying “we’re looking into what we need to do here and will update you”.
14035,We’ll see what happens!
14036,"A large portion of people fully vaccinated won’t get a booster any time soon, approval or not."
14037,A large number of Americans probably wouldn’t.
14038,The US already has an excess of shots stored.
14039,The majority of which would likely cover boosters.
14040,"It’s not the reason the health are system is overloaded, but because antivaxxers are, the boosters are slightly more important."
14041,"When even mild covid can have you sick for weeks upon weeks, people need as much protection as they can get."
14042,It’s not like most people can afford time off work for that long.
14043,"There’s also the fact that lowering overall community transmission is important- if people won’t get vaccinated, have less people able to spread it will help the healthcare system in the long run."
14044,Especially given how most Americans lack affordable healthcare at all- long covid is still possible with breakthrough infections.
14045,That’s not a risk most Americans can afford to take.

14051,*
14052,Some of it is your source of information.
14053,There was a time before the internet and social media that people consumed information that was professionally edited i.e.
14054,"TV, newspaper, etc."
14055,It was biased in its own way but crackpot theories were weeded out.
14056,"Today any idiot with a crazy idea can get thousands of followers, and when he figures out a way to say things that generate a passionate response in people he'll get even more."
14057,You can make up a lie out of whole cloth and people start to take it as fact.
14058,"Then those people start to distrust mainstream/reputable media and the crackpot becomes their only source of information, and they gravitate towards friends and family that are the same and now they live in a misinformation bubble."
14059,"In terms of the emotions I think a lot is driven by politics, ""us vs. them"", preconceived biases, or thinking that they are getting the inside scoop on who is ""really"" running things."
14060,"Conspiracy theories like the Illuminati and alien civilizations have been around since forever, social media has just given them a voice they never had."
14061,That seems expensive.
14062,Can you get at-home tests?
14063,We have a 3 year old in daycare and I can relate.
14064,We have a bunch of quick antigen tests we can give him when he gets sick.
14065,We don't particularly want to be \*that\* family that sent their kid to daycare with COVID and a gulp of tylenol.
14066,Then again he is sick about 50% of the time with something or other.
14067,"At some point they gotta go back, because Papa isn't making money watching Paw Patrol at home."
14068,I wish everyone would just get their stupid vaccinations.
14069,Mee?!
14070,"That's strange, I've never heard it pronounced this way."
14071,Yeah I know it's the Greek letter from math classes.
14072,In my area they are alternating between hospitals and public schools (mask mandates).
14073,"They've literally had a judge order them to stop disrupting schools, and are still going down there anyway."
14074,And of course the police largely being far-right and operating in bad faith aren't doing much about them.

14077,Does that count include all the OSU students/faculty for whom it is required?
14078,That would be a significant chunk right there.
14079,Would consider that statistic equally as valid in isolation as this statistic (since after all it’s precisely the same statistic) — i.e.
14080,not particularly valid in isolation.
14081,[removed]
14082,"They might delay it or cancel those plans, when they've reviewed the Lancet data."
14083,Or they might not.
14084,Or something else.
14085,I got a Moderna booster after 2 Pfizer shots.
14086,"The Moderna reaction was slightly less intense at peak, but lasted 1.5x as long."
14087,But I had abnormally strong reactions to both.
14088,"My mother got 3 Moderna shots, the 3rd was about the same as the 2nd, had her in bed for a day."
14089,Her partner got 4 shots of Pfizer and hasn't had any side effects from any of them.
14090,My high risk parents won't lie to get a booster which is what people will have to do unless they approve boosters for at risk people.
14091,I'm not being obtuse.
14092,we should know which businesses are full of covid.....that way we can avoid them.
14093,good lord i wont be going to cali or texas lol
14094, White privilege is not recognized but some health or physical issues are expectations.
14095,A non English speaking country.
14096,But it's still more protection than not getting the vaccine.
14097,So every front line provider.
14098,I did not need a code
14099,cm....
14100,[removed]
14101,She's also anti-mask so I don't think she'll go for the testing either.
14102,"Not trying to make a personal point, I just don't care enough to have that conversation with her."
14103,My doctors want me to start that too and it would likely help improve my quality of life.
14104,But I didn’t know whether to laugh or cry when I told them there’s no way I’d ever start that during covid.
14105,Not with the attitude some people have toward anyone that’s vulnerable.
14106,Edit: I wish you luck getting your vaccine.
14107,Don’t get down on yourself for waiting.
14108,"Just be vigilant and once you get the vaccine, it will bring a lot of relief."
14109,[removed]
14110,"Yes, and ***third doses*** are still the priority at the moment."
14111,They’re highly recommended for and currently available for immunocompromosed folks.
14112,"Similarly, current data on ***boosters*** also supports providing those at some point, and scientists are working hard to determine when they’d be most useful."
14113,While I don't disagree with your point in practice I also think that boosters aren't that hill where the cure is worse than the disease.
14114,Exposure is fine as long as spread is pretty limited and honestly our babying of the anti-vax crowd has to stop.
14115,Whe.
14116,Triage is needed or others need care they should be relegated otherwise there is no back to normal.
14117,If a booster of the vaccine helps prevent the vaccinated from becoming ill I see there being a purpose to that.
14118,Especially with some of the systems covid hits.
14119,"Yeah, my uncle got a breakthrough case a few months ago."
14120,"He was basically laid out on his ass for two weeks, beyond miserable."
14121,"Took him over a month for his taste and smell to come back, and for his cough to go away."
14122,He still had trouble breathing for weeks.
14123,He’s finally back to normal now at least.
14124,But he was considered a “mild” case too.
14125,"Not being able to work, exercise, or basically function for weeks is not something I can do."
14126,Just because I probably won’t end up in the hospital doesn’t mean I’m going to gamble with being sick for weeks.
14127,Kind of like a company mission statement.
14128,"It meant something to the owner once, probably."
14129,And that's about it.
14130,[removed]
14131,"Jeff I have some good news and bad news… 

So you have COVID."
14132,"That’s the bad news… 

The GOOD news is I’m hindsight it will make your cancer feel like a piece of cake."
14133,Also Stick It is underrated as a sport movie.
14134,There's an actual large really venomous species of spiders that will sometimes pop out of crates of tropical fruits at grocery stores.
14135,I forgot what it's called though.
14136,"Keep in mind, the risk of inflammation in teenage boys from the vaccine is drastically lower than the risk of inflammation from a natural COVID19 infection."
14137,Of course determining risk is a personal choice but that part of the data is pretty clear.
14138,You need to specify that the Bronx has the lowest vaccination rate **in NYC.
14139,"** As it stands, 60% of the population in the Bronx have at least one shot."
14140,"Where I live, in Manhattan, we're at 78%."
14141,We're still doing good overall and pretty much everyone here still masks up.
14142,Plus we have vaccination requirements for indoor activities like dining and such.
14143,All of this is why Delta isn't much of an issue here.
14144,No one here wants a repeat of Spring last year.
14145,Or tell her that she has the option of getting tested 1-2x per week also.
14146,No need to make some major personal point about it.
14147,She’s actually double vaccinated so I don’t know where this is coming from.
14148,"She lives in the north east, she’s young and healthy, she’s not afraid of covid."
14149,"I do see her side however, my mom and I are higher risk and live in Florida so we’re asking her for a little compromise to keep us safe when she visits and she’s just fighting us so hard on this"
14150,You can get the vaccine but it might not provoke much of an immune reaction to be useful.
14151,So this means you have to be really careful around anyone likely to be infected.
14152,"The worst part is not only those who are unvaccinated that die not only leave say 2 to 4 kids without a parent, they most likely don't have life insurance."
14153,Raising kids are expensive and especially where  those who leave behind 4 kids.
14154,"You got to pay that mortgage off and when the breadwinner usually the male is gone forever, you are screwed."
14155,Those Gofundme can only do so much and won't last 18 years of expenses.
14156,The only thing that these now single parents can do is file for Social Security benefits for their children.
14157,"Depending on how many kids, the parent gets essentially child support even though it is small until the child turns 18."
14158,You know socialism.
14159,That's really the only safety net these people have.
14160,I work for a government contractor and so far we've been told that they have not been provided any finalized implementation details.
14161,My guess is your company is in the dark about how they're supposed to validate employees vaccination status.
14162,"For most employers (outside of clinical healthcare), this is a whole new ballgame."
14163,"For one of the few times in our lives, the oligarchs' interest in keeping us productively working converges with our interest to avoid hospitalization, lasting health damage, and death."
14164,What did you mean?
14165,Agreed.
14166,"I have a 10yo with asthma, but I still want this vaccine to go through the proper approval channels."
14167,It would be a complete disaster if this got approved and there were safety markers that were missed.
14168,Also you run the risk of catching covid waiting in the long lines to get tested at these places.
14169,6-10 hours was the estimated time at a few of the local urgent cares.

14217,I went to a crowded bar afterwards.

14219,This is not going to be the same as last fall/winter.
14220,"In terms of individual infection, no, it's not a big deal."
14221,However Delta is highly contagious so now it becomes a numbers game.
