0,"I thought I had the common head cold last week, realized on Friday (yesterday) that while my head was clearing, I still couldn’t smell."
1,Went for a test just to be sure and it was positive.
2,I wear my mask pretty much every where in public places even though I’m vaccinated.
3,Not sure where I got it but I sure do hope my taste and smell comes back.
4,These symptoms are the ones I feared the most of getting COVID.
5,Damnit!
6,[deleted]
7,We will get through it.
8,Because we must.
9,"And since we must, we might as well make the most of it."
10,Any fully vaccinated person can get sick from any variant or the original strain.
11,This is not news.
12,"Because most people can keep their masks on during a doctor's appointment, and literally no one can during a dentist's appointment?"
13,"But even if everyone was fully vaccinated, wouldn’t the virus continue to mutate since it can still infect a host that has the vaccine but with little to no symptoms?"
14,Then be given to young or compromised people?
15,I feel like the virus can’t go away since it still can infect a vaccinated host and had the ability to mutate and infect another.
16,It will always be constant vaccines and booster until we find a way eradicate it.
17,I agree.
18,This is why I take what the WHO says more seriously and they are saying bring back masks.
19,Delta Omicron Gamma Epsilon.
20,"Yep, smart kids wanna live to grow up not die for mommy and daddy's mental instability and belief in fairy tales and Fox."
21,[deleted]
22,Yup!
23,Very interesting read.
24,Thank you for sharing!
25,Is this factual?
26,"I feel the media’s been pounding on it being generally more traditional cold symptoms (sore throat, runny nose)."
27,"Regardless, don’t feel too bad, You didn’t know you had it."
28,But the delta variant is more similar to the common cold's symptoms.
29,"At least by I know, the vaccines are effective against deaths."
30,"But you can get sick of covid, even if you you're full vaccinated."
31,No?
32,"I'm from Brazil and seems I'm living in another planet, because what I've heard until now, is that you can get sick and you can also transmit covid, even if you have the 2 doses."
33,Now there's a study for that?
34,"Well...at least in Brazil, we always had that information..."
35,"I heard people usually had less chances of getting covid, if they are fully vaccinated...less chances doesn't mean no chances..."
36,So why is one of the most vaccinated countries in the world going back to masks?
37,at the end of the day?
38,"at the end of the literal day the kids are responsible for their health, so they wanna get vaccinated, it's not complicated"
39,Children have rights in a civil society.
40,"The guardianship of parents is not considered, either legally or ethically, to extend into the infliction of harm either through intent or omission."
41,Refusing to vaccinate your children is abusive.
42,"""responsible"" doesn't mean you can beat your kids."
43,It doesn't mean you can fail to obtain appropriate medical care.
44,You have to provide food.
45,No.
46,I can imagine you are good at it.
47,Are you still providing that service and feel like commenting on the last 18 months?
48,Was it specified by WHO if it is recommended based on local vaccination rate?
49,"&gt;	The vaccines main purpose never was to prevent infection, but decrease the severity of the disease."
50,No that was not the purpose when they were creating the vaccine.
51,There's a part being conveniently left out: San Francisco city workers will be required to be vaccinated against the coronavirus when a vaccine receives full federal approval.
52,That means full fda approval not just Emergency use
53,Well every person that catches it has the chance to create a variant.
54,So social distancing and masks need to continue.
55,"The link currently seem to be broken between cases and straining the NHS, is what you could say."
56,You could say something about high level of deaths or hospitalisations.
57,"But cannot be said with certainty, as you're early in the wave."
58,"However, saying the link between cases and hospitalisations/deaths is broken, is false."
59,It is just an easier term to use.
60,Saying the link between the two is less significant is more correct.
61,"Comparing absolute amounts is not what matters here (in comparing the definition of ""a link"")."
62,It is one trend following another.
63,R of 1 means that Canada is failing to contain Delta.
64,"How that is ""looking good"", I have no idea."
65,So I guess we aren’t gonna move on from this then.
66,Gee thanks China
67,Not sure but I don’t want to chance it either way.

75,"Ultimately, they are better citizens than you are."
76,it accounts for like 99% of cases in my country now plus i initially had GI symptoms which appears more common with delta
77,You're just plain ignorant if you think that's abnormal behavior.
78,I’m immunosuppressed and I got my Pfizer vax in April.
79,I contacted my doctors to get an antibody test and my doctors both said the cdc doesn’t recommend getting an antibody test because you can get negative results despite having some protection.
80,I went to Compunet and got my own test anyway and it came back negative.
81,Doctors tell me I don’t need a third dose but I’m not taking any chances.
82,I’m continuing all precautions.
83,I really don’t want to die because of an immunosuppressant.
84,"&gt;, I am also uncomfortable with these teenagers going around their parents, even if their parents are wrong for not allowing the teenagers to receive the vaccine."
85,Why are you uncomfortable?
86,Why exactly shouldn't they be legally allowed to get vaccinated?
87,"The year of masking up is going to leave everyone susceptible to all the ordinary colds, flus and upper respiratory viruses that normally float around."
88,"I’ve talked to a few fully vaccinated people that thought they had Covid over the past week and they turned out to be anything from ordinary illnesses to seasonal allergies, none tested positive."
89,What’s the rush to get rid of masks?
90,I received both shots and did not have any side effects except a sore arm (first shot was much worse).
91,"My fiancé had bad side effects from the first shot so we stocked up for her second like the doomsday was coming (tylonol, gatorade, pedialyte, and mary jane)."
92,We waited 72+ hours for side effects to kick in but they never did!
93,"Guess that makes you superior to my two BSc's (one in bio), MSc, in progress PhD, work in biotech, research into antibiotic resistance, and involvement in clinical trials."
94,"I love it when people on this subreddit pull out totally irrelevant credentials when they have no leg to stand on, Its amusing."
95,Could anyone tell me if the AstraZeneca vaccine is still effective with a 16 or 17 week interval between doses?
96,"I know that a 12 week gap showed good immunogenicity, but what happens when that interval is increased?"
97,A friend had to delay her second dose and is now concerned about whether she'll still develop immunity.
98,Thanks
99,Hospital admissions have gone up from 130 a day to 180 per day.
100,"Wave 1 peak was 3100 per day, wave 2 peak was 4100 per day."
101,Patients in hospital has gone up from 1000 to 1200.
102,"Wave 1 peak was 19,000, wave 2 peak was 34,000."
103,Patients on ventilation has gone up from 130 to 230.

105,Just to put some perspective onto those increases.
106,The next shot needs better reception
107,People 16-28 don't need precautions once they're vaccinated.
108,"If the government isn't letting them get vaccinated, then you can expect unchecked spread to continue."
109,Or potentially miscalculated?
110,"The CDC could very well recommend masks, again."
111,Not that many would listen…
112,A lot of my students have expressed that they are not confident their parents are making informed decisions about their unwillingness to vaccinate their children.
113,On the other hand I have had students express that they have been arguing with their parents because they do NOT want the vaccine.
114,Shit is unfortunate...
115,"Unlikely, if a symptomatic illness is reduced to cold like it will never happen."
116,A lot of anitvax folks caved to the vaccine basically because the mask mandates were lifted as sort of a trade off.
117,You think they’ll just slap a mask back on now you are dreaming.
118,Is it wise?
119,Who knows.
120,I can just say good luck getting compliance.
121,In Canada they’re strongly recommending Pfizer or Moderna for the second shot if you got AstraZeneca first.

137,Even at 50 you are still learning.
138,Delta wasn’t as dominant 3 months ago.
139,And are you sure your state is keeping accurate numbers?
140,They were given AZ which had a 12 week gap (reduced to 8 now because of Delta) instead of Pfizer which is 4 weeks.

Super good point about the test picking up virus in their system seeing as so many were asymptomatic."
145,I'm sure curious if we're going to need to rethink automatically using PCR tests on people who aren't showing any symptoms.
146,Is this really news?
147,Haven’t we all known that vaccines aren’t 100% effective?
148,"This is as stupid of a headline as saying “somewhere on earth, someone will get struck by lightning on the morning of February 23, 2026”"
149,*some fully vaccinated people may still get sick if exposed to any form of Covid-19.
150,I don't.
151,I just have a card and an Excelsior pass (from New York State).
152,Nasty little prions.
153,And the Cherry on top is data looks good that the vaccines also significantly reduce rates of transmission.

155,So you are a sample size of one.
156,Great.
157,"They're not 100% effective, no vaccine is."
158,But the 90%+ of people they are effective for is definitely a good thing.
159,The Problem there is that people won’t fully understand because they have little to no knowledge in medicine.
160,And sometimes there is just no way to be able to fully explain that in language that ordinary people would understand.
161,My 19 year old brother now has mild COVID.
162,"Because it’s mild, will he recover easily?"
163,Neither your “fact” perspective nor your “fear porn” perspective match the article we’re commenting on.
164,This article is basically saying that vaccines are a little less effective against some variants but are still pretty effective and an important protective barrier for us.
165,It only mentions death once in the whole article and it’s in relation to people that are unvaccinated.
166,I don’t always like CNN but this article seems pretty reasonable.
167,Far from fear porn.
168,This is why I ignore my dad when he makes fun of me for wearing a mask when I leave the house.

242,No one vaccinated in Israel is sick with the virus (-immunocompromised people).
243,They are just taking extra precautions.
244,Getting my first shot in late March required that I reserve a time slot at a CVS drug store 40 miles from my home one way.
245,I needed to do this twice as I was required to return to the same store for dose #2 so a total of 160 miles of driving just for this.
246,"Not complaining, just explaining that getting the vaccine was not easy to do earlier this year."
247,These tests can usually be ordered qualitative or quantitative.
248,"Qualitative gives a yes/no answer, like the one you got."

288,Vaccine records are usually kept by the state and don’t follow you over state lines.
289,"If you crossed state lines and showed up for a walk in vaccine, they would have no reason to refuse."
290,Give it time.
291,People need to have other vaccinations to go to school and join the military.
292,"This vaccine will eventually join the ranks of measles, mumps, and rubella."
293,"FYI some Ab tests screen for Ab to the nucleocapsid protein of the virus, but the vaccine has us making Ab to the spike protein."
294,"In other words, you could have a negative result for covid Ab if you are fully vaccinated but never had covid."
295,Make sure you check before they run the test that it specific to the spike protein.
296,Nah he’s the real deal
297,I had zero side effects from either dose.
298,"For some reason, that worries me even more lol"
299,Right.
300,"I was vaccinated in March / April, caught covid in June."
301,But that’s not totally unexpected.
302,"The vaccine significantly reduces, but does not eliminate, your susceptibility to catching covid."
303,It **greatly** reduces the risk of hospitalization and almost fully eliminates the risk of death.
304,"It’s horrible because it’s making people think that the vaccine is useless, when that’s simply NOT TRUE."
305,Wearing masks by choice is the ‘new normal’ in the Americas.
306,We aren’t going back to the old normal.
307,So would non reactive mean you’re more susceptible to getting the virus?
308,"I have, I enjoy not being an idiot who purposely makes a pandemic worse."
309,"I do hope to see this reflected in Belgium as well, although until now they haven’t announced anything."

351,"More like we look at the data about vaccine efficacy, hospital admissions, fatalities and other related metrics, make an informed decision and realize that “no, it’s not very alarming”."
352,"You can do that to, you know."
353,[removed]
354,We are at 61% right now total population and 71% eligable.
355,Alberta as more young people than most provinces so we have lots of unvaccinated people.
356,Also     the urban areas like Calgary and Edmonton bring up the provincal average.
357,High level I believe is at 19%.
358,Isreal brought masks back Alberta is going with none.... Ahs and our provincal govenment really have done a great job of controlling covid.
359,I have no faith in them.
360,I donated during this time and received someone else’s results.
361,Also almost all spread is among the unvaccinated or those with only one dose as well.

363,Precisely.

365,It is time for restrictions to end.
366,Vaccines are highly effective.
367,The choice now is about saving yourself.
368,"I am vaccinated, I still wear a mask."
369,The Delta variant has broken through the mRNA vaccines in a few cases.
370,I don't intend on being one of those.
371,[removed]
372,Any Idea where you picked it up?
373,?
374,I think it’s mainly because masks don’t protect you; they protect the people around you (unless of courses you’re wearing an n95).
375,"So if you have covid and don’t wear a mask you spread it, if you don’t have covid and are wearing your mask the protection is eh depending on the type  mask that makes the difference."
376,We know covid is airborne so if your not vaccinated and worried get a good mask.
377,It’s about risk at this point.
378,Also a lot of people are getting sick because there’s exposure now to well everything.
379,Our immune system isn’t use to it.
380,Work in a preschool for a year than see how your immunity increases by the second year...
381,This is seriously impressive.
382,"No, I’ve just been completely unsympathetic towards you for propagated incorrect information."
383,"I provided you very easily understood evidence that what you were saying is incorrect, and you can find more of it if you want."
384,"Yet you continued to argue, and then needlessly pulled out your academic history."
385,"It was quite funny, actually."

388,I don’t think you are wrong.
389,It’d explain why Ontario for example is doing such a drawn out reopening (we got a lot of AZ first shots and we are following them up with mRNA 2nd shots but it takes time)

391,Yep!

400,A surge would inevitably involve the delta variant.
401,60% *one* dose coverage was enough to control B.1.1.7.
402,in the UK.
403,Alberta wouldn’t experience any kind of surge without that variant being involved.
404,"Considering that the mRNA vaccines are highly effective against the Delta variant, I’m not sure a surge would matter for the majority of vaccinated people or those around them."
405,"Plus, Quebec and Ontario are likely to get near or exceed 80% coverage."
406,"Even if Alberta is more vaccine hesitant, I doubt it would plateau at 65% fully vaccinated, last I checked at least 69% of Albertas population has at least gotten one dose."

409,I couldn’t find any details about the status of those that tested positive.
410,Read 2 articles but neither went into details.
411,some equate that combo to be the most immune anywhere.
412,natural + 1x mrna was 10x-20x in some studies the antibodies as 2x mrna and no prior infection.
413,"I have read those stories as well, but I would really like some official data."
414,Watch some Vincent Racaniello videos.
415,Totally calms me down.
416,Start from the beginning of this chain.
417,Who was the person who was needlessly condescending?
418,You!
419,Who thinks that saying there isn't a linear relationship between cases and deaths means they're uncoupled?
420,You!

428,He got mad I didn’t “consult” him.
429,But I knew he would not want our 12 and 15 year olds to get it.
430,I did.
431,"So, I asked them."
432,"They both wanted it, I didn’t pressure them at all."
433,The three of us are fully vaccinated now.
434,I worry about my husband and the Delta variant.
435,Some vaccines have years between doses.
436,"It's not been tested, but it should be fine."
437,"Yes, like I stated, they are doing a commendable thing protecting other people, but I was replying to the post above stating young people were making this choice because they don’t want to die."
438,You sound like you're saying that isn't enough to worry about..
439,The Delta variant is more virulent and deadly than those before.
440,I would say 324 deaths would be plenty to get me to get the shot considering it's reported as having a higher level of penetration and illness in younger populations than prior strains.
441,"I can think of 600,324+ reasons to just get it done and not tell mom and dad."
442,"In fact, it is my firm belief that the President should issue an executive order indemnifying health pros who administer shots to any child who asks."
443,"I think it's how it has been displayed in the media and governments, talk of this is the number we need and we are safe,  or herd immunity."
444,"Most people likely think that well they said we do this and we are all good, if we reach so many percent vaccinated we are at a safety threshold."
445,"And all they talk about is this is the vaccine its like a miracle how quick it happened, and everyone must have it"
446,Trying real hard to get ahead of the variants
447,When I get my first cold since (can’t really remember) I’ll probably do the same.
448,"Ya that’s true, although it’s more of a risk given the low efficacy of one dose against the delta variant, it was a safer bet against ancestral variants."
449,"Glad that yours eventually returned to normal, and thanks for the heads up of what may be in store."
450,I appreciate not being surprised by the crazy possibilities with this virus!

457,"COVID-19 has today spread to NT and WA, which have been doughnuts days most of the last year"
458,I'm a boomer and I signed up as soon as I was eligible.
459,Younger family are anti-vax.
460,Checked my arm with a magnet.

465,TRANSLATION: you are wearing your masks for life!
466,So did you study for 4 years about the soda you drank today?
467,This matches my experience so closely.
468,"I have struggled to put to words the 'off' smell (parosmia), but artificial smoky is exactly it."
469,"Weirdly I get it with some of the things you mentioned but also peanuts, some citrus, and cooked pasta."
470,I'm so glad you got your full smell/taste back after 6 months.
471,I am 4 months post-infection now.
472,young people have the lowest vaccination rates.
473,"Paywall 

Welp at least the title sums up the issue well enough............."
474,I hope
475,"Most of the people I work with got the Pfizer, myself included."
476,"Those who felt symptoms the worst weren’t  particularly healthy (overweight, smokers, sedentary lifestyles)."
477,I had a sore arm for two days and that was about all.
478,I’m pretty active and I don’t smoke so I’m wondering if there’s any correlation.
479,Just until October until Pfizer shipments arrive in bulk.
480,Everyone knows AZ is second best and are waiting for PF.
481,After October we'll rapidly make gains in vaccination.
482,Once we reach x% they'll start with privileges for the vaccinated during lockdown.
483,I.e.
484,Those fully vaccinated don't have to comply with stay home orders/wear masks.
485,This will persuade even more.
486,The NSW premier already said the reason there aren't privileges for the vaccinated in the current lockdown is the low %.
487,But I expect the situation to be different when % is higher.
488,"Not much they can do unless they are willing to face there parents and risk getting kicked out the house (past 18)/other types of punishment (no allowance/WiFi e.g) 

Which chances are many at that age are not willing to do

Heck if my fokes threatened they would kick me out the house if I had the shots I would not have it either, would I be happy about it?"
489,"Gosh no, but sometimes at that age you gotta stomach some bs, wether you like it or not"
490,You’d be surprised.
491,Covid call center nurse here.
492,"When I call positive results to patients and they are fully vaccinated, they get so confused on how they were able to be infected with the virus."
493,I don’t how people equate vaccines to a cure.
494,"People pay money for not being ""vaccinated"" by russian liquid."
495,That is the only thing you need to know about its quality.
496,Hillarious.
497,I started wearing a mask at work during winter 2018.
498,I work in healthcare and get 3-5 colds every winter and the moment I saw my first patient with flu like symptoms in 2018 I decided to mask up until March.
499,"I'm going to continue doing it now every year, especially since I found the kn94 masks that don't rub against your mouth."
500,Haven't had a cold since 2018 or the flu since 2015!!
501,I'm sure I will get a cold this year (I have a young child) but at least the cold will come from him and I won't bring home a cold from work and possibly infect my whole family.
502,Your radio station is wrong
503,I don’t think this anti-vax movement is necessarily a boomer thing.
504,Not sure if you will see this but I had COVID back in November before the vaccine and lost my taste and smell.
505,I lost it for about 15 days then it came back in stages.
506,Be prepared once it comes back that things won’t smell or taste the same for awhile.
507,"After about a month from when my taste and smell came back fully, suddenly eggs, peanut butter, and onions tasted and smell super bizarre for me."
508,It corrected after about two months after that.
509,So just be prepared for bizarre smell things to happen

541,There's still medical and religious exemptions.

726,This is very good news.
727,In Q2 BioNTech/Pfizer surpassed their contractual numbers by delivering vaccine bought by the EU for Q4.
728,Now they will scale down to normal deliveries for Q3 and people feared a slow down in vaccinations.
729,Moderna will now fill this gap and Germany will be able to stay at 5million shots per week.
730,"Apparently they had problems with producing enough distilled water for the fill &amp; finish in Spain, which seems to be solved now."

801,I think it just boils down to justification for their needle phobia.
802,"My point was that if you look at the rate of vaccination among teenagers and young adults, there are still a lot more unvaccinated than those who have gotten it."
803,Many countries require a vaccination against yellow fever.

942,Link to 45% of recent deaths being double vaccinated?
943,I don’t think they’re the same group of teenagers.
944,The teens being discussed in the article are minors… hence they need their parents’ permission.
945,The people you’re talking about are certainly adults.
946,As a recent high school graduate I can say I had little to no time to waste last spring with exams and shit.
947,Can you provide A single youtube clip where Biden or Fauchi were giving a public interview where they tell us to take the vaccine because it's safe and then they provide a link to medical data to back there up?
948,On the other side of the coin the World Health Org is now recommending against children getting the vaccine due to adverse risks from the vaccines so why is the US doing the opposite of what eh data suggests?
949,There are multiple fallacies in this report.
950,1) we in India had initially 4 weeks gap between doses.
951,"All the healthcare workers are vaccinated using this regime which we know already know isn't the best 

2) All of them are vaccinated with AZ or locally made covaxin, both fall a bit short compared to m rna vaccine

3) the study has ridiculously low no."
952,of participants.
953,I am not sure why isn't there a study encompassing all the health workers in the nation to get a proper picture
954,That's because 99% of the people at risk of dying from covid are vaccinated.
955,The number would be much higher without vaccines.
956,"Most people who die in car crashes are wearing their seatbelts, doesn't say anything about seatbelt efficacy other than that most people are wearing their seatbelts."
957,Exactly how I thought this would happen when we open up here in Canada too.
958,Cases will inevitably rise the media and some people will scream for another lockdown and post scary headlines but in reality hospitalizations and deaths will remain way down from their peaks earlier this year a sign the vaccines are clearly working.
959,"No but fun fact, I was scared of needles back during H1N1 and I opted to take the nasal shot as a result"
960,Is there a table of CFR for variants?
961,"Is there an organized genomic surveillance system of systematic sequencing or it is based on ""we need a paper on this let's start sequencing this and that pop"""
962,The US does comparatively very little genetic sequencing and the places in the US where they do the most are the places with higher vaccine coverage and lower overall Covid rates.
963,"No idea if this is covered in the article as it's behind a paywall, but while at one level it looks really bad ([Ourworldindata](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&amp;time=2020-09-13..latest&amp;pickerSort=desc&amp;pickerMetric=total_vaccinations_per_hundred&amp;Metric=Reproduction+rate&amp;Interval=Weekly&amp;Relative+to+Population=false&amp;Align+outbreaks=false&amp;country=~ISR) estimates an R of around 2.2), it's worth noting that this is up to around 700 cases, with around [half of those in unvaccinated children](https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/delta-outbreaks-prompt-limits-in-australia-israel-as-india-warns-of-new-mutation/ar-AALrizl)."
964,"In the adult population, the figures seem to be that around half are fully vaccinated - which, given that around 80% of adults there are fully vaccinated, suggests the vaccine is still doing a fairly good job (even if maybe not quite as good as we'd like)."
965,"What's really going to be important over the next few weeks is how many of these fully vaccinated people go on to develop serious symptoms, need hospital treatment or die."
966,I think Delta will surpass the 60k peak before the end of July.
967,Because most internet bull about vaccines lead people into no vax rabbit holes.
968,"And once they are there, there is no way out unfortunately

I have several Russian friends, educated and living in Western Europe."
969,A very concerning percentage of them don’t want to be vaccinated.

975,And I would probably have made a good lighthouse keeper.
976,"Down vote the fuck out of it, the truth hurts and is always the first casualty of honest opinion."
977,"Somehow even after numerous of waves across the globe, Reddit still doesn't seem to have an understanding of the destructive power of ""exponential growth""."
978,"If vaccine rates keep lagging, the possibility of peak cases surpassing that of winter 20/21 is a serious possibility, especially because I can't fathom the UK going back into lockdown."
979,"While hospitalization and deaths will be low relatively speaking, in absolute numbers it could still be quite high."
980,"I think EU is in a slightly better place due to (1) high vaccination rates, (2) currently still low prevalence of Delta variant and (3) UK acting as a warning signal."
981,But even for the EU it should be worth concern.
982,"Two unknowns:

1."
983,Can you still transmit it?
984,2.
985,Will you still have a chance at getting long Covid (which we don’t know could be permanent)?
986,Either or both of those would still be pretty terrible.
987,I’m hoping we find out soon.
988,I’m leaning towards both of those being unlikely but we don’t know yet.
989,"I've had 4 lockdowns so far

They aren't fun and I don't wish them on anyone else

Vaccination is the path forward 

I've had a 1st shot of AZ"
990,It wasn't so long ago.
991,At least until the late nineties- early2000s I was taught this in med school as the reason for not including certain vaccins.
992,Of course things can changed as side effect risk can change as well as the prevalence of a certain condition
993,Ah yes…even though my fellow Americans know the long term effects of not living a healthy lifestyle!
994,"I think the last I read like 23% do the *minimum* recommended amount of exercise, we have officially passed the 40% mark of obese adults with 42% and some 70% are overweight in general."
995,*That’s* a risk worth taking though and purposely doing the bad stuff!
996,But please….let’s pretend like health is now a major concern.
997,Nevermind that the trials started in Mar ‘20 and any type of reaction whatsoever will almost always come within 8 weeks or the fact that the side effects at this point aren’t even close to the severity of getting the virus itself!
998,"People that say this are either moronic and just don’t want it or *may* be smart enough, have a valid concern but lack enough common sense to use that tricky program called Google…..where you just type in what you’re looking for."
999,It's not that unreasonable.
1000,It would be illegal to get a tattoo or to drink alcohol.
1001,The language is crude but it's not exactly scandalous that a parent would take actions to protect what they perceive as a threat to their literal child.
1002,Maybe it depends on the vinegar but I was rinsing a jar that had pickled jalapenos in it and the combo of vinegar and capsaicin sent me reeling for a few minutes.
1003,Apple cider vinegar or balsamic can really get up your snout.
1004,"I get your frustration, but your examples here are all anecdotal."

1006,It is definitely worth concern.
1007,It's a cat and mouse race between the vaccines and the Delta variant now.
1008,"UK isn't keen on going back into lockdown, which could potentially see peak cases go far beyond winter 20/21."
1009,"A lot of people could end up in the hospital or die, even though relatively speaking things are looking good."
1010,The vaccinate rates are simply not there yet.
1011,Unfortunately autumn and winter won't be pretty in the US states with low vaccination rates when you look at how the Delta is spreading in the UK considering their vaccination efforts.
1012,Link?
1013,I remember reading that the Israel cases were fully vaccinated.
1014,There's a post over at r/CoronavirusUK showing the difference between this wave and previous waves in terms of hospital admissions and deaths: https://www.reddit.com/gallery/o8sju2
1015,"Per article: “Despite the new outbreak, the country’s current death rate remains close to zero, and only 26 of 729 active coronavirus patients were hospitalized, according to data released by the Health Ministry.”"
1016,&gt; And she thinks I’m the crazy one.
1017,&gt; He’s at ZERO risk from COVID.
1018,Looks like she's right
1019,"I think Canada is in a very good position due to high vaccination rates, high uptake and low prevalence of Delta variant."
1020,This should give Canada sufficient time to reach a sufficient vaccination level within the population before Delta becomes something too worry about.
1021,"That was a long time ago, they definitely do now"
1022,"Yeah, but the real fuckup is that ~800 people crossed the border without getting tested."
1023,Because they lacked capacity for testing at the border and decided to just let people pass through.
1024,"Then again, some of the people who tested positive decided to go to restaurants anyway, fuck those people."
1025,https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/covid-19-daily-deaths/
1026,Source for this comparison?
1027,"One key difference is that restrictions are much looser now, which could result in way more positive cases compared to previous waves."
1028,"Relatively speaking everything could be fine, but in absolute numbers still a lot of people may end up in the hospital or die."
1029,"We're charting unprecedented area now, at the same time a lot of people haven't received their first or second dose yet."

1040,&gt;We have to go back to Hell because the variants outdo the vaccine.
1041,So your version of Hell is having to wear a piece of cloth in front of your face?
1042,Whew lad.
1043,"If Hell is real, I hope that's exactly what it's like."
1044,A new outbreak primarily in the unvaccinated group.
1045,A big population in Israell are children and thus not able to get vaccinated yet.
1046,"I'm aware there is no England tag, which is why I clarified that the article doesn't apply to Europe despite its current tag."
1047,So that anyone wouldn't think that the entirety of the European continent has vaccinated half of the under 30s adults.
1048,And it doesn't even apply to the entirety of the UK either.
1049,You are going to need to re-read the title of the article.
1050,"They’re referring to Delta Plus, not just Delta variant."
1051,"Delta plus could be a game changer (yes, even when fully vaccinated) if we don’t take appropriate measures quickly."
1052,I felt nothing on my first and took a big nap after my second.
1053,It was a non-issue.
1054,The sides are a bit overblown.
1055,How does wearing a piece of cloth on your face negatively affect your mental health?
1056,"Hell, *not* wearing a mask should make your mental health worse since you're more likely to get the delta variant and whatever other worse one might appear in the future."
1057,I reckon you do agree UK or in this case England is placed in Europe?
1058,And as that's the case then using the Europe tag is correct as no England tag has been created.
1059,So you could complain to the moderators for them to add more flairs but I doubt they will add individual kingdoms of the UK or even add the UK either.
1060,Or you could look at the list of flairs and decide if Europe englober England or if you would rather label it as south-Asia or whatever.
1061,I'm not so sure about thanking them.
1062,They're the most undervaccinated group in the US right now and with little trend towards improving those numbers in any meaningful trend.
1063,They're also currently the highest rate of spreaders.

1065,How do you get vaccine in India as a 19 year old?
1066,Is India not vaccinating the oldest first?
1067,I see only 4% could get fully vaccinated there so far so I'm curious

1086,"You could give those people all western vaccines, they would do the same."
1087,&gt; It wasn't clear whether those people had been fully or partially vaccinated.
1088,It says later that 2 doses protects against delta but one dose protects against severe cases...
1089,Nothing new here.

1091,Did you read the comment you responded to?
1092,"No, but it says Europe."

1094,England and Europe are different geographical entities.

1099,"Even in a car, each 100km trip you have about a 1 in million chance of dying."
1100,And yet we do that without a detailed risk benefit analysis.
1101,There's a HUGE amount of antivaxxers and people who believe in conspiracy theories that think that vaccines are evil and contain a microchip or covid virus which can infect them.
1102,The majority of people think in this way.
1103,"Not to mention the fact that lots of people are buying fake vaccine certificates which ""prove"" them to be vaccinated when they're not."
1104,"The UK has thousands of times more people than any study, so anything improbable enough to not happen in the study may still happen when applied to the whole country."
1105,"No scientist will tell you that vaccines are 100% effective at preventing death, they will only tell you that nobody who received the vaccine died in the trial from COVID-19, nothing more, nothing less."
1106,Furthermore highly vulnerable people who probably wouldn't volunteer for the study will still receive the vaccine.
1107,Add the variants then death rates on these vulnerable people could increase.
1108,Denying your children vaccinations is child endangerment.
1109,Does it say EU?
1110,Wait no it doesn’t.
1111,And yet despite that only 23 deaths.

1134,"Health Minister Chen Shih-chung (陳時中) said at the CECC press briefing that cluster infections around the country are now one of the main focuses of disease prevention efforts, including the one in Pingtung County."
1135,The cluster in Pingtung originated from a woman and her grandson who recently returned to Taiwan from Peru.
1136,"Of the 12 COVID-19 cases in the cluster, eight of the people infected have now been confirmed to have the Delta variant of the virus, according to new genome sequencing results Sunday, Chen said."
1137,"Because the remaining four cases in the cluster are all relatives of those infected with the Delta variant, it is likely that they have also been infected with the same variant, Chen said."
1138,"The Delta variant of COVID-19 was first detected in India, and is the ""most transmissible"" of the variants identified so far, according to the World Health Organization (WHO)."
1139,"The Pingtung cluster involves the first locally transmitted cases of the Delta variant in Taiwan, and the government has quarantined 173 contacts of the patients as well as stepped up vaccination efforts in the area."
1140,"Of the 88 domestic cases reported Sunday, 41 were in New Taipei, 33 in Taipei, and eight in Tainan."
1141,"Taoyuan reported three cases, while one each was reported in Hsinchu City and Pingtung and Nantou counties."
1142,"The source of infection in 60 of the cases has been identified, 26 are under investigation, and two have unknown sources, the CECC said."
1143,"There was also one new COVID-19 case that originated outside of Taiwan, involving a Taiwanese man in his 20s who recently returned from Austria."
1144,"The nine deaths were three men and six women in their 40s to 90s, who passed away between June 22 and June 26."
1145,"They all had chronic illnesses, according to the CECC."
1146,"To date, Taiwan has confirmed a total of 14,634 COVID-19 cases, over 13,200 of which are domestic infections reported since May 15, when the country first recorded more than 100 cases in a single day since the beginning of the pandemic."

1153,Please tell me your logic how it's it anti vax.
1154,The USA as been bad at public messaging about covid.
1155,It's not moving the goal posts if scientist learn something new about the virus and how it can spread.
1156,That is how science works!
1157,Saying covid is officially over on a specific date or ignoring new evidence is not really looking at the science.

1186,"I’ve got 3 under 10, including a newborn, so the reopening of things is very stressful for us."
1187,[removed]
1188,one point that can't be neglected though is that children under 12 are still at high risk for contracting covid since they're not eligible to be vaccinated.
1189,For parents who want to resume social &amp; extracurricular activities this summer it's problematic just because the distancing &amp; masking mandates they previously employed in the spring will no longer be effective.
1190,For these families it's still a huge concern because there's no clear guidance on how to avoid the Delta variant without isolating in a bubble.
1191,This is particularly true for those who live in regions with lower vax rates &amp; escalating cases.
1192,"This survey shows that the majority of black people have heard of the Tuskegee scandal, even those who live a long way away."
1193,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2702151/#!po=34.1667

Interestingly black people who have heard of Tuskegee are *more* likely to be willing to participate in drug trials, suggesting it doesn't have a huge negative effect on trust."
1194,Perhaps the take-away is that well informed people are more likely to take part in drug trials and well informed people are also more likely to have heard of Tuskegee.
1195,Sadly most people of all races were likely to believe the false statement that black people were injected with syphilis as part of the scandal.

1199,"I mean Pfizer is 96% effective against hospitalization, so we know there's not a ton of hospitalizations either."
1200,"Of course Delta can potentially be deadly to the elderly, but the vaccines remove a lot of the risk."
1201,88% is not much different than the 91% that was found in real world against Alpha (the current strain).
1202,Definitely!
1203,I think that's why hard and fast rules can be very difficult.
1204,Things are so different place to place and changing every day.
1205,Lol that's not going to get everyone especially in the US.
1206,Sorry to say it but once kids can get it the un-vaccinated are on their own.
1207,There's not much more we can do as a civilization beyond making vaccines that are 88% effective.
1208,&gt; And what prescriptions exactly are pharmacies filling for infectious diseases?
1209,"I don't have the time or inclination to list out all of the infectious illnesses that can be treated with a variety of pharmaceutical drugs, but to throw out a few, let's start with strep throat, certain types of pneumonia, various types of cold and flu, etc."
1210,"Doctors will commonly prescribe medications to treat symptoms - like decongestants, cough syrups, etc."
1211,- even if they can't treat the actual illness itself.
1212,Is this your first day on earth?
1213,&gt; Who was going to a pharmacy knowing they had COVID vs. going anywhere else?
1214,"I mean, if the people I know are any indication, lots of them?"
1215,"Lol I'm glad the people you know are super responsible about COVID, but a lot of people aren't, and I know plenty of people who have tested positive for COVID and then proceeded to go pick up shit from the pharmacy."
1216,&gt; COVID wasn't primarily spread at pharmacies obviously.
1217,Nobody said it was.
1218,"You keep trying to focus this on COVID, but again, the comment you replied to did not specify COVID."
1219,"The exchange went as follows:

""I will basically never go into a place with a higher than average concentration of sick people without a mask again - hospital, doctor's office, pharmacy, etc."
1220,"Probably not grocery stores either."""
1221,(sick people = not specific to COVID.)
1222,"In response: ""Especially the pharmacy and ER, literally 100% chance you’re being exposed."""
1223,You are assuming they mean exposed [to COVID] when I am reading it as exposed to [infectious illnesses of all kinds].
1224,Nobody said COVID was spread primarily in pharmacies or even that you're more likely to catch COVID there.
1225,"They said you have a ""literally 100% chance of being exposed"" if you're in the pharmacy or the ER."
1226,"Now I don't necessarily agree with that specific number, but yes, it's insane to think you're not more likely to encounter sick people in an ER or a pharmacy versus, say, a movie theater or the mall."
1227,Thank you for sharing your experience.
1228,That is really disappointing to hear a logic based argument shot down because “regulations met.”
1229,"The US has high, not extremely high."
1230,There are many countries in the EU and the UK with a similar vacination rate.
1231,Annoyingly there is a massive vaccine disparity between states in the US.
1232,"For example;

U.S - 56%
UK 62%."
1233,"It takes time to go on each countries statistical sites but as you can see, the US is pretty much on par with these countries so it's not extremely high at all compared to the countries allowing US citizens to travel to them."
1234,[vaccine statistics](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/vaccinations)
1235,88 percent effectiveness would still be one of the better vaccines ever created.
1236,Its a protein vaccine which I think is similar to Novavax.

&gt;	Transmission clusters in vaccinated health care workers associated with Delta variant

There was a single outbreak event that infected 11 healthcare workers, 1 required oxygen."
1239,"But the most damning part:
&gt;	Importantly, in this vaccinated population across three hospitals, the Delta variant was associated with greater transmissions to other HCW as compared to B.1.1.7 or B.1.617.1 (mean cluster size 1.1 versus 3.3, p=0.03, Extended Data Figure 1)."
1240,"There were no clusters of non-Delta infections comprising &gt;2 individuals,

&gt;	whereas there were ten such clusters for Delta variant."
1241,"Importantly, the median Ct value of B.1.617.2 Delta variant infections was 16.5 versus 19 for non-Delta (p&lt;0.05, Extended Data Figure 1), consistent with higher viral load in vaccine breakthrough infections where the Delta variant was responsible."
1242,The vaccine responses of HCW with subsequent breakthrough were measured and appeared similar to responses in a control group of HCW that did not test positive for SARS-CoV-2 subsequently (Extended Data Figure 1).
1243,They do this already by not wearing masks and going to parties.
1244,Nothing will change.
1245,If they can fill in the gaps that's good enough.
1246,"Let's say, vaccines for places like Haiti, Nicaragua, etc."
1247,Every bit helps .
1248,If you’re vaccinated and are reading the same statistics on breakthrough deaths then yeah pretty sure we are in the same country.
1249,It may just be that politics are affecting your viewpoint and preventing you from thinking rationally
1250,"The short list of most sensible ones I’ve heard:

1."
1251,The vaccine approval absolves the companies of any responsibility for side effects.
1252,"If you do suffer some rare life changing unforeseen side effect from the vaccine, there is zero possibility of compensation for you or your family."
1253,2.
1254,Known vaccine side effects are being downplayed (Heart Inflammation and Blood clotting for example).
1255,Personally I’m pretty sure I experienced heart inflammation after my first dose of Pfizer because I had a pressure on the center of my chest intermittently for like two weeks before it went away.
1256,3.
1257,"Policy makers are calling for unprecedented “vaccine passports” and other authoritarian measures, which just sets off the true conspiracy theorists who believe it’s all part of the global reset plan."
1258,"You have governments threatening people with losing their jobs, ability to travel, ability to send kids to school etc over getting a vaccine which no one has any legal responsibility for."
1259,That’s a recipe historically for some real government driven horror shows.
1260,Try not to stress!
1261,Things are getting better every day and I'm sure your industry will be back up and running at full steam very soon.
1262,"If there was a lockdown in the US over such a small outbreak, people would riot in the streets…oh wait."
1263,"If more and more cases are occurring in kids (because large numbers of adults are vaccinated), vaccines moving into that population will have an effect to reduce cases."
1264,I think we have to be careful about jumping to conclusions.
1265,There isn’t yet evidence to show this variant circumvents vaccines in any meaningful way.
1266,"It’s another log on the covid messaging dumpster fire 

There has been some sort of hysteria concerning every variant that’s emerged so far ."
1267,Remember the “sense of impending doom” with the Kent variant.
1268,?
1269,The United States got a mosquito bite of a bump in cases and than bottomed out .
1270,Normal people can’t “see” or study variants so it’s up to the various health organizations to relay the message and in reality they can just say whatever they want and we won’t know heads from tails .
1271,"This WHO official says without evidence, that vaccines won’t stop delta plus and everyone is supposed to jump ?"
1272,I’m sorry and I know WHO does a ton of good and will push to get the undeveloped world vaccines but with COVID they’re compromised.
1273,So we still eradicated polio without a vaccine mandate is what I'm getting from this story.

1281,The unvaccinated will end up filling hospitals and provide the perfect breeding ground for an even more vaccine resistant variant.

1291,The morons don’t care about safety measures like masks anyway and will infect the people with medical conditions soner or later.
1292,I dug a little bit and Public Health England just put out a study saying that the Pfizer vaccine is 1% more effective for Delta than it is for previous strains.

1297,"If this is as effective as they say, it will be awesome news to many place that can't afford Pfizer or Moderna, or who have slow vaccine rollouts"
1298,Cuba will need to sell the vaccine to someone who actually has the industry and expertise to mass produce them.
1299,Wearing masks is like wearing a seatbelt when you drive your car but social distancing is like only driving 15 MPH on the roads.
1300,Social distancing is a big deal and I hate that it is grouped in with masking.
1301,"Considering the Sinopharm/Sinovac vaccines hovered around 50-60% efficacy against the original strain to begin with, I wonder how the countries who participated in China’s ”vaccine diplomacy” will handle a potential new wave of Delta."
1302,"Good thing, anyways, is that the Pfizer/Moderna jabs seem to be doing okay still and the Novavax trials seems very promising thus far + would offer the mRNA-hesitant crowd an alternative + is a vaccine that is easier to store and (I think) is cheaper to produce"
1303,"They didn’t determine it was safe, they determined that the rate of blood clot incidents was low enough to be worth continuing to distribute it."
1304,That’s the rub really.
1305,As long as the vaccine harms statistically less people than Covid it will always be the best policy decision.
1306,There’s an element of utilitarianism at play here.
1307,Does oseltamivir still effective against covid19 now?
1308,My country still give me oseltamivir as antivirus for covid19.
1309,"But i read some journals that oseltamivir isnt doing anything against covid 19
I’m considering whether or not to change oseltamivir to inosine pranobex/isopronosine"
1310,"Your post insinuates that wearing masks is going to solve our problems when in the past, it really didn’t."
1311,It’s comes off a little anti-vaxxy.
1312,Do you think the people that are holding out on getting a vaccine are going to mask up?
1313,And do you think mandating them again will drive more people to get a vaccine or just cause people to see no light and just give up more than they already have?
1314,[deleted]
1315,The witty commentary and clever comebacks you wish were happening aren’t happening.
1316,"Get over yourself and log off the internet for a bit, you may find yourself a bit happier and far less sour that things are happening around you that you don’t understand."
1317,They're realizing the rules their parents have set are unnecessary.
1318,"So there are teens who are ""breaking rules."""
1319,"It reminds me of my friend getting a state ID behind his Mother's back because she believed he was signing away his life by giving the government consent to ""butcher"" her son since he registered as an organ donor."
1320,I think we (and some public health officials) are also learning that there are smarter ways to do lockdowns.
1321,"The non-triviality of the mental health toll has become pretty apparent to everyone at this point, and needs to be planned around"
1322,"Because the entire sceince world was bashing on sputnik for not being properly made, then for not being 3rd stage tested, then there were rumors of it being a live virus."
1323,There was so much controversy and confusion about sputnik and also not enough public information readily available for public that it is no surprise that common folk just don't trust this thing.
1324,"Furthermore, it is one thing to have info available to you about vaccine, another is to have it easily digestible."
1325,Because even an abstract from an article is sometimes more confusing for a dude who never read anything remotely connected to bio science journal.
1326,I know it took me some time to understand it.
1327,"Some people don't have time, some patience."
1328,It is complicated for many.

1350,I wouldn't say cities have sky high rates.
1351,They're good and comparable to some Western European countries but they don't reach rates of over 90%.
1352,"I'm vaccinated too, but continue to wear a mask, because I want to be a positive example to those around me."
1353,One of the greatest determining factors on whether people wore masks or not was if other people around them were wearing masks.
1354,I don't want to be *that guy* who is seen as encouraging those around me *who are not yet vaccinated* that it's okay to go maskless.
1355,"Because, of course, it isn't."
1356,"I view people not wearing masks as small-minded, petty and self-indulged, since they can't be bothered to do the most minuscule thing to help those around them."
1357,According to Cuba.
1358,"More vaccines are always good though, so hopefully their success rate stays optimistic when their work is analyzed by more impartial authorities."
1359,We aren't struggling.
1360,Deaths and new cases in the US are at their lowest point since the beginning of the pandemic in March of 2020 and are still falling sharply despite states opening up and lifting restrictions.
1361,The vaccine is 90% effective against the Delta variant and 94% effective against the standard variant.
1362,Half the country is fully vaccinated and there are almost a million doses per day still being administered.
1363,The most vulnerable population (the elderly) is 88% vaccinated.
1364,"You don't need to be afraid, my friend."
1365,Gotcha.
1366,Edited!
1367,"Increasingly, frustrated teenagers are searching for ways to be vaccinated without their parents’ consent."
1368,"Some have found their way to VaxTeen.org, a vaccine information site run by Kelly Danielpour, a Los Angeles teenager."
1369,"The site offers guides to state consent laws, links to clinics, resources on straightforward information about Covid-19 and advice for how teenagers can engage parents."
1370,"“Someone will ask me, ‘I need to be able to consent at a vaccine clinic that is open on weekends and that is on my bus route."
1371,"Can you help?’” said Ms. Danielpour, 18, who will begin her freshman year at Stanford in the fall."
1372,"She started the site two years ago, well before Covid."
1373,"The daughter of a pediatric neurosurgeon and an intellectual property lawyer, she realized that most adolescents know neither the recommended vaccine schedule nor their rights."
1374,"“We automatically talk about parents but not about teens as having opinions on this issue,” she said."
1375,"“I decided I needed to help.” Ms. Danielpour wrangled experts to help her understand vaccination and consent laws, and she recruited teenagers to be “VaxTeen ambassadors.”  
  
“I want teenagers to be able to say to pediatricians, ‘Hey, I have this right,’” added Ms. Danielpour, who gives talks at conferences to physicians and health department officials."
1376,Elizabeth surreptitiously got her vaccine at a school pop-up clinic.
1377,"After administrators at her boarding school informed parents they would be offering Covid shots, her mother gave permission."
1378,Her father forbade it.
1379,"Upset, Elizabeth consulted the school nurse, who said she could not be vaccinated without approval from both."
1380,"Elizabeth researched state laws, learning that she wasn’t old enough to consent on her own."
1381,She showed up anyway.
1382,"At worst, she figured, the school would just turn her away."
1383,"Apparently, they took note only of her mother’s consent."
1384,"Saying nothing, Elizabeth stuck out her arm."
1385,Now she is in a pickle.
1386,The school is requiring students to be vaccinated for the fall semester and she says her father has begun warring with the administration over the issue.
1387,"Elizabeth is afraid that if he learns how she was vaccinated, he will be furious and tell the school, which will discipline her for having deceived vaccinators, a stain on her record just as she is applying to college."
1388,"Gregory D. Zimet, a psychologist and professor of pediatrics at Indiana University School of Medicine, pointed out the irony of an adolescent being legally prevented from making a choice that was strenuously urged by public health officials."
1389,"Developmentally, he said, adolescents at 14 and even younger are at least as good as adults at weighing the risks of a vaccine."
1390,"“Which isn’t to say that adults are necessarily great at it,” he added."
1391,"In many states, young teenagers can make decisions around contraception and sexually transmitted infections, which are, he noted, “in many ways more complex and fraught than getting a vaccine.”  
  
Pediatricians say that even parents who have themselves been vaccinated are wary for their children."
1392,"Dr. Jay Lee, a family physician and chief medical officer of Share Our Selves, a community health network in Orange County, Calif., said parents say they would rather risk their child having Covid than get the new vaccine."
1393,"“I will validate their concerns,” Dr. Lee said, “but I point out that waiting to see if your child gets sick is not a good strategy."

Elise Yarnell, a senior clinic operations manager for the Portland, Ore., area at Providence, a large health care system, recalled a 16-year-old girl who showed up at a Covid vaccine clinic at her school in Yamhill County."
1395,"Her parents oppose the vaccine so she wanted to get it without them knowing, which she could do legally because Oregon’s age of consent is 15."
1396,"She teared up when she saw the shots were not ready before she had to be home, but she was able to return that night without alerting her parents and was vaccinated."
1397,"“She was extremely relieved,” Ms. Yarnell said."
1398,"Isabella is the 17-year-old daughter of Charisse, the Delray Beach, Fla., mother who refuses to grant permission for the vaccine."

As Parents Forbid Covid Shots, Defiant Teenagers Seek Ways to Get Them  
  
By Jan Hoffman|Jun."
1417,"26th, 2021  
  
Most medical consent laws require parental permission for minors to get a vaccine."
1418,Now some places are easing restrictions for Covid shots while others are proposing new ones.
1419,"When the mother of this Florida teenager blocked her from getting the Covid vaccine, the 15-year-old was uninvited to a friend’s party and continues to feel excluded from many social events because she remains unvaccinated."
1420,Teenagers keep all sorts of secrets from their parents.
1421,Drinking.
1422,Sex.
1423,Lousy grades.
1424,"But the secret that Elizabeth, 17, a rising high-school senior from New York City, keeps from hers is new to the buffet of adolescent misdeeds."
1425,She doesn’t want her parents to know that she is vaccinated against Covid-19.
1426,Her divorced parents have equal say over her health care.
1427,"Although her mother strongly favors the vaccine, her father angrily opposes it and has threatened to sue her mother if Elizabeth gets the shot."
1428,"Elizabeth is keeping her secret not only from her father, but also her mother, so her mom can have plausible deniability."
1429,(Elizabeth asked to be identified only by her middle name.)
1430,The vaccination of children is crucial to achieving broad immunity to the coronavirus and returning to normal school and work routines.
1431,"But though Covid vaccines have been authorized for children as young as 12, many parents, worried about side effects and frightened by the newness of the shots, have held off from permitting their children to get them."
1432,A recent poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that only three in 10 parents of children between the ages of 12 through 17 intended to allow them to be vaccinated immediately.
1433,Many say they will wait for long-term safety data or the prod of a school mandate.
1434,"But with many teenagers eager to get shots that they see as unlocking freedoms denied during the pandemic, tensions are crackling in homes in which parents are holding to a hard no."
1435,"Forty states require parental consent for vaccination of minors under 18, and Nebraska sets the age at 19."
1436,(Some states carve out exemptions for teenagers who are homeless or emancipated.)
1437,"Now, because of the Covid crisis, some states and cities are seeking to relax medical consent rules, emulating statutes that permit minors to obtain the HPV vaccine, which prevents some cancers caused by a sexually transmitted virus."
1438,"Last fall, the District of Columbia Council voted to allow children as young as 11 to get recommended vaccines without parental consent."
1439,The New Jersey and New York legislatures have bills pending that would allow children as young as 14 to consent to vaccines; Minnesota has one that would permit some children as young as 12 to consent to Covid shots.
1440,But other states are marching in the opposite direction.
1441,"Although South Carolina teenagers can consent at 16, and doctors may perform certain medically necessary procedures without parental permission on even younger children, a bill in the Legislature would explicitly bar providers from giving the Covid shot without parental consent to minors."
1442,"In Oregon, where the age of medical consent is 15, Linn County ordered county-run clinics to obtain parental consent for the Covid shot for anyone under 18."
1443,"According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, which has been tracking Covid-related bills, some states, including Tennessee and Alabama, are working on legislation to prevent public schools from requiring Covid shots."
1444,"The issue of who can consent to the Covid shots is providing fresh context for decades-old legal, ethical and medical questions."
1445,"When parents disagree, who is the arbiter?"
1446,At what age are children capable of making their own health decisions and how should that be determined?
1447,"“Isabella wants it because her friends are getting it, and she doesn’t want to wear a mask,” said Charisse, a mother of a 17-year-old in Delray Beach, Fla., who asked that her last name be withheld for family privacy."
1448,Charisse fears the shot could have an effect on her daughter’s reproductive system (a misperception that public health officials have repeatedly refuted).
1449,"“Isabella said, ‘It’s my body.’ And I said, ‘Well, it’s my body until you’re 18.’”  
  
As both the legal debates and family arguments unfold, those administering the vaccine at pharmacies, clinics and medical offices are trying to determine how to proceed when a young teen shows up for the Covid shot without a parent."
1450,"“We may be in a legal gray zone with this vaccine,” said Dr. Sterling Ransone Jr., a family physician in Deltaville, Va."
1451,"In his health system, a parent can send a signed consent form for a teenager to be vaccinated."
1452,"But because the Covid vaccine is authorized only for emergency use, the health system requires a parent to be present for a patient under 18 to get that shot."
1453,"Marina, 15, who lives in Palm Beach County, Fla., — and who, like others interviewed, asked not to be fully identified — longs for the shot."
1454,But her mother says absolutely not.
1455,The subject is not open for discussion.
1456,And so Marina has been excluded from the social life she covets.
1457,"“Five of my friends are throwing a party and they invited me, but then they said, ‘Are you vaccinated?’” she said."
1458,“So I can’t go.
1459,"That hurts.”  
  
As the pandemic ebbs, some teen social circles are reconstituting based on vaccination status."
1460,"“I see my friends posting on social media — ‘Woo-Hoo I got it!’ — and now when I see them, they ask me things like, ‘Where have you been?"
1461,Are you traveling a lot?
1462,"Are you sure you don’t have Covid?’ It sucks that I can’t get the shot,” Marina continued."
1463,1/2
1464,The elders could hunker down and watch tv.
1465,We just have to drop off food and essentials at their doors.
1466,"Yeah, that was me mixing up the vax number from like a month ago with the case number."
1467,Wrong one.
1468,"So weird, I just watched the Trump rally last night and something about this conversation is giving me Deja Vu."
1469,"Ah, that’s it, it’s the same old, same old record player on repeat feeling."
1470,"Try a new argument, that one’s a dud."
1471,These are studies with very large datasets that show the vaccines are working.
1472,This is enough data to make conclusions.
1473,"It is possible the data is wrong, sure, but no reason to think that right now."
1474,Yeah I don't know what the WHO is smoking.
1475,At the beginning of the pandemic if we had a vaccine that was 88% effective we'd be pretty stoked.
1476,"It's going to spread and mutate and people will get a booster every few years similar to the flu, but more effective because it can't mutate as fast."
1477,Eventually we might get a vaccine that targets more than the spike protein that is more resistant to mutations.
1478,Link please?
1479,What data?
1480,The correlative transmission analysis?
1481,"If so: Transmission analysis is not proof that Delta is more contagious, harmful, deadly, or vaccine-resistant than previous strains."
1482,That Delta is displacing previous strains (which I believe is true; that's how mutations work) is not proof that it is more dangerous.
1483,The term “anti-vax” has been used culturally as a reference to a resistance to all vaccines.
1484,If we’re changing that term to mean a hesitation towards any vaccine in existence then I was not made aware of that change.
1485,Just slap together a few variants into a booster and bam: done.
1486,"That’s the whole advantage of the mRNA vaccines: when a new RNA segment shows up that seems concerning, just slap some of the concerning mutation  into the mix."
1487,"I assume after the 351 mutation approval gets through, it will end up more like flu vaccines where you inject into ~600 people, see the results and approve from there."
1488,Because by in large the US has extremely high rates of high quality vaccinations compared to pretty much all other countries at this point?
1489,"I never once said I wasn’t and even said the exact opposite, but thanks for trying to talk down and villainize me."
1490,"Meanwhile in Colombia, vaccine rollout is slow and masks haven't gone away in the first place."
1491,"This attitude kills your elders, but the logic is there if you don’t think deeply about what it means"
1492,"In your example it'd be that given a cohort of 105 people who get COVID, you'd expect 5 are vaccinated."
1493,Obligation.
1494,"It gives the vibe that it's your choice whether you follow it or not, but you're choosing to be a piece of shit if you don't"

1501,I certainly won't discount your underlying medical conditions.
1502,There are legitimate reasons for some people to be worried.
1503,Those people should see a medical professional and plan their care accordingly.
1504,"But for the vast majority of people, vaccination is a non-event."
1505,"I'm sorry that you are one of the extreme few that had issues, but you're still in an extreme minority."
1506,I'm just frustrated.
1507,"After a year and a half of living through a pandemic, it's difficult to have patience for people who don't care about anyone but themselves."
1508,"I mean the better straight talk is that right now it is safe to go to a crowded club or a gym without a mask because cases are low and the vaccine is effective, but that might change in the future."
1509,We can tailor recommendations to case levels.
1510,Anything above 60% is considered good
1511,It's gonna be like this for the next century

1527,So not even at the library or is a library in India very different?
1528,:)
1529,Yes he was reading beers and cigs with his friends.
1530,[removed]
1531,That’s not entirely the case.
1532,They’re really pretty similar and the J&amp;J performed better against the variants in the clinical trials though wasn’t quite as good as AZ after two on the UK study (but it was only maybe 2% different).
1533,Also J&amp;J’s effectiveness increased doing forward to day 57 so if you compare the numbers at day 57 the J&amp;J numbers are actually better than the two dose AZ.
1534,Regardless of that though won’t the large number of under 18s cause a spike?
1535,Do they have a rollout plan like the US does to use Pfizer?
1536,It should also be required for employment.
1537,Nearly every job requires at least some occasional interaction with people.
1538,"If you want to get hired in the USA, you have to show proof that you can legally work."
1539,Make it so you must show proof of vaccination as well.
1540,"If you refuse, you should be ineligible for unemployment."
1541,Same!
1542,"Socialised with a larger group of people for the first time in months, got a cold for the first time in over a year."

1556,"I don't know about the UK, but many countries in Europe mandated a ban on visiting people."
1557,"While in most countries this is not really enforceable (for various reasons, not all of them legal), some do."

1559,Greece issued pretty hefty fines for people visiting others and even higher fines for the hosts.
1560,I’m too poor

1568,Safety trials and approvals though
1569,I would look them straight in the eye and tell them that at some point you have to start accepting risk in life again.
1570,Stay locked indoors forever then if you don't agree.
1571,But don't you dare try to make the rest of us live in fear once we're all vaccinated.
1572,The rest of us will continue with our lives once fully vaccinated.
1573,Covid is not going anywhere and we have to accept that we have to live with covid just like we do with the flu.

1580,I barely felt my first one go in.
1581,They were so quick.
1582,It wasn't very sore.
1583,The second one hurt.
1584,She injected so slowly.
1585,"Then it hurt for like a week after, kept waking me up at night even."
1586,I also got Pfizer.
1587,What's the positivity rate?

1591,"When all the people that are likely to die with covid are vaccinated, obviously more deaths are going to be in vaccinated people"
1592,"Plus we are at the beginning of the biggest wave yet with the Delta spreading, this is going to convince many people who are undecided about getting the vaccine, or thinking about skipping the second dose."
1593,"To stop delta, we need 80%+ people fully vaccinated, I think this won't happen because under 12 cannot receive it, yet."
1594,And the vaccine uptake for 12-16 year olds should be quite low.
1595,I mean ethically speaking.
1596,Consenting to sex isn't the same as consenting to a medical procedure (like vaccination).
1597,Don’t forget about their new line of Novichok perfume!
1598,Jesus what a fucking autistic comment
1599,Who says you can't do contact sports?
1600,"Rugby, football and American Football are all playing grassroots competitive this weekend..."
1601,Kids can't consent.
1602,"That's the same logic that says that 13 year old boy can't consent to sex, even if he says he consents it doesn't matter and you can't have sex with kids."
1603,"Even if 16yo boy consents to having a vax, his consent isn't binding and a parent is needed to consent on his behalf."
1604,That's how medical services for kids work in most situations around the world.
1605,"Parent has to agree to medical procedure for their kid, otherwise medical personel has no right for doing the procedure."

1617,"It’s analogous to telling a scientist that gravity makes your pen fall *upwards*, to the scientist that is pure nonsense."
1618,"Just like telling an anti vax person that vaccines are beneficial, the anti vaxxer is so deep in their hole of bullshit they can’t even see the light at the top anymore."
1619,"Maybe for you, but you can also become a carrier for it and spread it to those who cannot protect themselves from it."
1620,I work at a supermarket.
1621,I am with the public at large.
1622,"While I did avoid getting sick, I also took many precautions to prevent that."
1623,I hope those same precautions also helped to prevent others from getting sick through me.
1624,"Consensus is the effects are felt much more after second dose, hang in there"
1625,The problem is it involves engaging them in conversation.
1626,"It's not that we don't want to, but I've gotten better conversations from a brick wall."
1627,"These people generally do not want to engage in a meaningful discussion with someone outside of their group since that might, y'know, cause them to actually think."
1628,"I have, and the vaccine rollout has been going pretty well"
1629,Yup most “young people” are too young to be vaccinated.
1630,Had an anti vax person do the magnet arm test with a coin and when it surprisingly didn’t work they claimed it happens at random times to random people.
1631,Personally I think once over 50’s are vaccinated restrictions should be lifted.
1632,I’m not sure international travel will be a true reality until all the vulnerable are vaccinated.
1633,But I concede to your point on the impact on the young.
1634,"Coming up to two years when they should be enjoying life, finding love and figuring out life is horrible for them."
1635,The unmeasured damage to their mental health too.
1636,"There are plenty of volunteers in the trials for the various Covid vaccines candidates, and adverse vaccine effects tend to appear within a short time, months not years."
1637,"In addition, at this stage *100's of millions* of people have taken various of the vaccine candidates."
1638,"This is why rarer side effects that occur in the range of 1:100,000 or rarer are being discovered."
1639,"So they certainly are being thoroughly tested, but you'll be waiting for a couple of years for the Pfizer trial to wrap up (for one example), because the potential utility of booster doses are in at least one of  their larger trials."
1640,[deleted]
1641,"Yes but the issue lies in people who don’t get the vaccine or vaccine their kids, think the virus is a hoax and continue on their merry way sending the kids to school and further spreading the virus."
1642,"&gt; Side effects are really rough

I appreciate that you may have had a bad reaction, but I don't think it's helpful to generalize like that."
1643,The *vast* majority of people have little to no side effects.
1644,"Our RKI is very slow in declaring new virus variant countries, Portugal was added after 11 days when there was already data of Delta variant circulating in Lisbon."
1645,"True, the point I’m trying to make is that no sane argument will change an anti vaxxers opinion."
1646,But spreading anti-anti-vax on Facebook might…
1647,"From what I understood from the new numbers from Germany, Finland and Denmark, our current calendar should be outdated and deliveries from moderna should be around 130-150k/week starting the second or third week of July."
1648,Then indeed 200 in august.
1649,But we will see.
1650,Maybe Belgium passed on the extra doses of Moderna during the order and let other countries get their extra share.
1651,We zullen zien.
1652,"Technically, living also guarantees death, but we do sure do our damnest to prevent that as long as possible... or at least the smart ones (and those without crippling mental illness) do."
1653,"Of course it wont stay in Lisbon, it was already everywhere but more in Lisbon."
1654,[deleted]
1655,This argument doesn’t work since anti vax people think the vaccine will guarantee their death.
1656,I'm optimistic.
1657,In most states the vaccination rate for ages 60+ surpasses 80% ([https://www.zeit.de/wissen/gesundheit/corona-impfungen-deutschland-impffortschritt-aktuelle-zahlen-karte](https://www.zeit.de/wissen/gesundheit/corona-impfungen-deutschland-impffortschritt-aktuelle-zahlen-karte)).
1658,The majority of Germans are in the age group of 45 to 65 and those ages are more severely affected by covid infections.
1659,Thus hopefully more willing to get vaccinated.
1660,We are at 44.4 million having their first shot.
1661,Ignoring the few vaccination for minors so far getting to 75% of the adults (52.5 million) isn't much further.
1662,"Extrapolating those numbers, I expect weekly deliveries in Belgium from Moderna of 100k doses per week in July, 200k in August, and 250k in September."

1835,Hospital workers have to be there.
1836,"Public safety workers, police, firefighters, paramedics, have to show up."
1837,Agricultural workers have to show up so food isn’t rotting in the field and animals aren’t starving.
1838,Everyone in the supply chain that gets food from agriculture to your plate has to show up.
1839,Pharmacists.
1840,"Plumbers, electricians, and other trades, because stuff still breaks and has to be fixed."
1841,Truck drivers.
1842,"Factor in support industries, the truckers need gas, the pharmacies need medication shipments."
1843,A large portion of this country *can’t* lock down.
1844,That’s why it didn’t work the first time.
1845,Now consider the people who just got a little freedom back.
1846,"Not even the ones who are planning big vacations, just Average Joe who realized during half-assed “lockdown” how much he missed going to the gym."
1847,"You’re going to need a real goddamn emergency to take that back and not cause him to resent the politician responsible, right?"
1848,So governors are going to be real careful about walking back reopening.
1849,"They’re going to need a strong justification, and they just don’t have one at this point."
1850,I’m too tired of these people to care anymore.
1851,Enjoy the ventilator!
1852,We may be actually willing to pay for that...
1853,Stupidly poor uptake would be a much better title.
1854,I just don’t see the gap.
1855,That implies there is a discrepancy between two things.
1856,"Whats really concerning to me about israel is that if you go to the data dashboard, you can see which towns are seeing new outbreaks and how many people are vaccinated and some of these outbreaks are occurring in towns with 65, 70, even 80% of the population fully vaccinated."
1857,What is the evidence to back your statement it’s mainly conservatives?
1858,[deleted]
1859,That's not how vaccine effectiveness calculations work.
1860,95% effectiveness doesn't mean 5% of people are going to get sick.
1861,When will people realize this... People have such short memories
1862,[removed]
1863,"Same ol' ""news"" headlines over and over."
1864,We can circlejerk haha stupid _____ all we want.
1865,There isn't much that can be done on this front.
1866,Hopefully with time for one reason or another this changes.
1867,Not enough people have had close relatives that died.
1868,"COVID is about to ""hold my beer""."
1869,"Yeah, I understand the mechanics of airborne disease transmission."
1870,"(Your hypothetical model is a bit oversimplified since each infectee has contact with more than one other person, perhaps instead hundreds or thousands of people if they are walking around a big city or attending weddings or flying on an aircraft."
1871,"If some of those other people are vaccinated that helps, but it doesn't stop anything.)"
1872,I also know that a large fraction of the population needs to be vaccinated for a vaccination program to work.
1873,I don't know any reputable authority that thinks 40-50% is some kind of magic threshold where a highly transmissible disease will no longer spread.
1874,Most people are talking 80 to 90% depending on how contagious the organism is.
1875,"The Delta variant is about 2x as contagious as the Alpha variant, by the way."
1876,Future variants may come along that are even worse as billions of people continue to incubate the virus over the next few years (though I sure hope not!).
1877,"And of course, worldwide, the number of people who have been vaccinated to date is about 10 to 15%, and it will take several more years to make substantial progress on this."
1878,"As we have seen, big outbreaks in other countries can rapidly spread to our home countries in a small number of months, especially if travel restrictions, social distancing, and masking are eliminated."
1879,You are aware that the article isn't about the UK right?
1880,"It's referencing England, not all regions of the UK have crossed the same threshold yet."
1881,Apparently it has left you a bit confused!
1882,"It is part of continental Europe, it is not all of continental Europe."
1883,It is a separate entity.
1884,"'Europe Half of adults under 30 have been given the covid vaccine' implies that half of the adults under 30 in Europe have been given the vaccine, that is far from the case."
1885,That's what I've been trying to explain to so many people who don't understand that 95% effective is not the same as 95% of covid patients being unvaccinated.
1886,"Also the ""surge"" is like 100-200 daily cases."
1887,"Compared to 10,000+ daily cases at the peak."
1888,I think that is something that should be highlighted
1889,I wonder how long covid circulates undetected in a population before it starts to show up?
1890,I find it hard to believe that all these cases are linked to just one person bringing it in accidentally.
1891,[removed]
1892,"Yeah I'm thinking, is this just what some things taste like now?"
1893,My symptoms were pretty mild too.
1894,"A tiny fever for a day, then basically common cold symptoms for a week."
1895,No lung issues or anything like that.
1896,Some lethargy in the afternoons.
1897,I'm also somewhat young (31) and quite healthy.
1898,"Considering that most people who catch it are asymptomatic, I'm actually more unlucky than I am lucky."
1899,"Either way, condolences to your father in law."
1900,"Unfortunately, Those dumb people will take others down with them"
1901,Lots of Darwin awards will be handed over in the next few months... maybe years
1902,lol america
1903,What a disaster messaging wise.
1904,Follow all the rules for over a year and then this.
1905,"We were told two weeks to slow the spread, then a few more weeks, then a few months... now we got the vaccine and it’s still not enough to the WHO and Israel or the UK

I don’t deny the CDC came out with their recommendations on masks out of the blue but it was based on the science that the vaccines are effective and cases are low."
1906,What I think is likely to happen is places without high vaccinations will see increases .
1907,Thankfully there’s less people and less density in those areas compared to the cities where a virus spreads insanely fast
1908,the short answer would be politics in Brazil can be worst than in India
1909,Some people use that as a sort of excuse to not get it.
1910,There is one person in my family that decided against it but can't really explain why.
1911,I'm happy we got it.
1912,[removed]
1913,What exactly is the endgame to that?
1914,Just how low do cases need to be for us to be able to unmask?
1915,Doesn't the body of evidence pretty much suggest that vaccinated individuals are at an extremely low risk to carry and transmit the virus?
1916,I don't know that it's accidental.
1917,A proper authoritarian leader knows to always keep his peons in a state of controllable fear.
1918,It doesn’t hit at once right after COVID some people take months https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2021/06/15/health/covid-19-patients.amp.html but the number 66% I got from a story out of the UK and it counts everything from mild depression to full blown can’t move -   COVID is scary strange shit bruh
1919,Use a commerical pharmacy.
1920,My experience registering my kids was of typing a birthdate into a web form.
1921,"They didn't check ID at the pharmacy, nor does a teen necessarily have a state ID."
1922,Get any adult to accompany you.
1923,"Yes, that’s why I literally said that in my comment."
1924,"The political movement against vaccination, however, is almost entirely a conservative one."
1925,I live in Florida and want to die everyday.
1926,Does that count?
1927,"A little too ironic  
And, yeah, I really do think"

1954,"Also, by the time a new strain comes, do you think the US will have Covid-19 very much under control?"

1991,We don't necessarily need to limit transmission at *any cost possible* anymore.

2059,This is not a question of whether the vaccines are effective.
2060,This is a question of whether the COVID pandemic is over.
2061,The vaccine is not effective unless and until it is injected into a gigantic fraction of the the world's population.
2062,This has not happened yet and probably won't for several more years.
2063,"Just inventing a vaccine by itself does nothing, and just injecting it into 10% or 20% of the world's population does very little."
2064,I think people have seen too many movies where the vaccine is invented in the last 5 minutes and then there's a quick happy ending.

2168,"&gt; Missouri hospitals stretched thin

&gt; Missouri is the state with the largest proportion of the Delta variant of Covid-19 infections, according to the CDC."
2169,"And hospitals in the state are feeling the stress of managing Covid-19 patients on top of their regular intake, one hospital leader told CNN's Ana Cabrera on Thursday."
2170,"&gt; ""Both hospitals here in town are stretched,"" said Erik Frederick, chief administrative officer at Mercy Hospital Springfield in Springfield, Missouri."
2171,"&gt; ""We saw a very rapid escalation in our in-patient census starting June 1, we went from 26 to 90 in about three weeks."
2172,"To go back to last year when our peak started, it took us six to seven weeks to escalate that quickly."
2173,"Today to hit 97, it really took us almost two months to hit that level which we've done in under a month."""

2190,The US didn't even try to enforce restrictions against that before.
2191,"While some states did put out advisories to not have the lesser of a certain number of people over, or a certain number of households over at your house, the cops were never sent out to ticket people for having too many cars in the driveway."
2192,I definitely don't see real restrictions about that being politically tenable right now.
2193,Perhaps it’s due to vaccine demand not vaccine shortage?
2194,Now that 18+ can sign up there has been increased demand and I think over this weekend especially is supposed to be one of those bumper periods.

2201,I never said we should force people to isolate and wear masks forever.
2202,I think people should be getting the vaccine and a lot of people's excuses for not getting it are not based on actual science and just false ideas or politics.
2203,And I dont think it's fair for you to say someone who truly is vulnerable needs to mask up and isolate for the rest of their life and can't enjoy their life out in public  just because of all these other people who refuse to do the right thing for their community.

2229,I got covid back in October in a group that seen one extremely good man die after suffering for nearly a month in a hospital and another woman linger on with problems for six months at home until she recently passed away so this has been a nightmare for me and has caused me a great deal of anger and frustration as of late because it seems every good thing that happens is diminished by something just the opposite and it can make a person feel a bit bipolar after a while.

An accurate count of Covid-19 infections and deaths is “a very important part of understanding how big a threat new variants are,” said Christopher Murray, director of the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation."
2379,Health workers transport a body to a crematorium in New Delhi.
2380,"PHOTO: DANISH SIDDIQUI/REUTERS
The institute’s modeling suggests the true Covid-19 death toll in India exceeds 1.1 million, close to three times the reported number."
2381,Dr. Murray estimates the scale of the undercount is similar to those in some countries in Latin America or Africa.
2382,He said the institute estimates India has detected only about 3% to 5% of all infections due to insufficient testing.
2383,"Murad Banaji, a mathematician at the Middlesex University in London who has been tracking the pandemic in India, estimates the country’s real death toll could be around five times the reported figure, based partly on mortality and serosurvey data, which shows the presence of antibodies in the population."
2384,"SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS

What’s your biggest takeaway from the latest Covid-19 outbreak in India?"
2385,Join the conversation below.
2386,"The undercounting of infections and deaths is a problem world-wide, even in countries with widespread testing."
2387,The World Health Organization said last month that the global Covid-19 death toll could be two or three times the official number.
2388,"The problem, however, is particularly acute in the developing world, where access to healthcare and coronavirus testing is often more limited."
2389,Health experts point to a number of issues that have led to widespread undercounting in India.
2390,One is that hospitals were turning patients away in April and May as the rapid rise in cases overwhelmed the healthcare system.
2391,That left many people to die at home without being tested for Covid-19.
2392,"At the time Mrs. Singh tested positive, her family was under tremendous strain from the disease, according to her son, Neeraj Shekhar."
2393,"He himself had tested positive five days earlier, and Mrs. Singh’s husband and two teenage grandchildren tested positive the same day that she did."
2394,"Shila Singh

To qualify for its Covid-19 compensation payment of 400,000 rupees, equivalent to about $5,400, the state requires a report from a certified lab, which at the time were taking days to process."
2395,The family got a test strip from the lab indicating that Mrs. Singh was positive and rushed to a doctor.
2396,"The physician, Dr. N.P."
2397,"Narain, said he ordered a CT scan and told the family to take Mrs. Singh to the hospital if her condition worsened."
2398,"“At that time they probably didn’t think they would need all this proper documentation,” he said."
2399,"With multiple members of the family sick, Mrs. Singh’s condition deteriorated rapidly and she died five days after testing positive."
2400,"The family could now use the state compensation to pay the nearly $1,300 in medical bills they racked up caring for family members with Covid-19, said Mr. Shekhar."
2401,"Health experts say many Covid-19 deaths have gone uncounted among India’s vast population of rural poor, who have little access to healthcare or Covid-19 testing."
2402,"In the village of Sirondhan in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, for example, Vijay Pal Singh said his 38-year-old wife, Mithilesh Devi, fell ill last month with a fever and struggled to breathe."
2403,"Mr. Singh said he took her to the village clinic and several hospitals in the district, but none had available beds or testing kits."

2424,"They included deaths at home, as well as in private hospitals and from health complications related to Covid, said Dr. Sunil Kumar, the Bihar state secretary for the Indian Medical Association."
2425,"To have a death counted, families have to produce test results from a certified lab or confirmation of infection from the healthcare system—but often, like Mrs. Singh’s family, they don’t have the required paperwork."
2426,"Dr. Kumar said he has treated patients who died after suffering from common Covid-19 symptoms, but because their families couldn’t produce a positive test the deaths weren’t included in the recent count."
2427,"“The figures could be higher based on what we are seeing,” he said"
2428,Those numbers are decent...
2429,If high actually
2430,^(crybaby)
2431,And it’s THAT which really infuriates me.
2432,Their actions keep restrictions for all of us.
2433,"Just when it seems the end is finally on the horizon, the new narrative is 'delta variant, delta variant!'."
2434,It's hard to blame conspiracy theorists at this point.
2435,The risk of contracting Covid while vaccinated is so minuscule it makes no sense for vaccinated people not to return to normal life.
2436,Same here.
2437,I do pull up the mask if people come within 20 ft.
2438,He already said dense people
2439,"You have absolutely no fucking idea if any of these individuals were older or immunocompromised, so stop trying to dissuade people from getting the shot."
2440,You're part of the problem too.
2441,Masking up is tolerable.
2442,The distancing has catastrophic consequences to mental health for all of us.
2443,Same in my town.
2444,Maskless percentages don't match vaccination percentages.
2445,It sounds like we are both professionals in the field.
2446,Consider the implications of what you are suggesting.
2447,"If exposure to the virus could lead to a positive test without actual infection, the real world impact would be that healthcare workers would constantly be testing positive without becoming ill."
2448,But we *aren't* seeing that.
2449,Nursing home workers have been required to test once or twice a week since last June.
2450,"They would be coming back positive all the time, leading to enhanced facility wide testing."
2451,But that isn't happening.
2452,"You seem to be suggesting that covid can live on mucus membranes long enough and in great enough quantity to cause a positive test, but not be able to invade the cells."
2453,The mechanism for continuing to test positive post-infection is different - that is genetic material the cells continue to replicate in small quantities.
2454,"I can't find any research that supports what you are suggesting, and would appreciate any you have to share."
2455,"Yeah we gotta take care of the teachers , I get that ."
2456,I’d go as far as offering early full retirement to teachers compromised over a certain age.
2457,"Again , problem is the ever changing metrics ."
2458,"At first it was in classroom safety measures, then it was lower levels of infection in the community and then it was we need teachers vaccinated after that it was kids need to be vaccinated and now we’re on to bogeyman variants in which they’ll be a perpetual stream ."
2459,It’s a racket by the unions and it’s leaving the public with a sour taste
2460,"It certainly would not, as the study used a the israeli data set from months ago."
2461,A quick study of the US excess mortality numbers adjusted for such factors as unusually low flu deaths shows that the US published figures for Covid deaths are indeed short of actual.
2462,"But not egregiously so, and those other figures are available so it's not as if US health officials are hiding anything."
2463,It's more like the realities of reporting mid pandemic are imperfect.
2464,Doctors in the crunch are not going to set aside dying patients to perfect the previous day's paperwork.
2465,"Not everyone makes it to the hospital, or expresses concern about symptoms before they die at home of ""natural causes""."
2466,Historically retrospective analysis of pandemics and epidemics and wars and famines rely first on population census and the excess mortality figures.
2467,Less than forthright reporting for political reasons is only one of many reasons the official numbers might be thrown off.
2468,"But if the virus was more deadly, there would be a lot more reasons for all people to get the vaccine."
2469,"Risks vs. benefits, that's it."
2470,"In the younger age categories, the risks vs. benefits balance is not the same as for the 60+!"
2471,If you’re fully vaccinated it’s safe to do anything according to the CDC
2472,Noooooo.
2473,The fact that there are 750 breakthrough deaths which has a significantly lower run rate than the flu and you are trapped in pandemic mode has nothing to do with politics.
2474,Lmao
2475,I have no idea why you got so many downvotes.
2476,I think when you look at the rate of COVID deaths in Australia compared to the US that you could make a pretty good case for lockdowns and travel restrictions being effective.
2477,"Yeah, I smell it everywhere."
2478,"Glad you seem to be recovering, gives me hope."
2479,Only hundreds of thousands?
2480,"We’re talking about a country with over a billion people with poor sanitation and abject poverty, and where countless many die without ever seeing a hospital or doctor, and simply get taken straight to be cremated."
2481,It could easily be well over a million excess beyond reported numbers.
2482,We’ll never know the full extent of it.
2483,[deleted]
2484,"Kappa seems to have more immune evasion, but doesn't spread as easily as Delta, which right now is the big issue given the still large numbers of vulnerable people."
2485,"Once we get close to herd immunity (which is going to be a while, given the high transmissibility of Delta and the large numbers of unvaxxed people), the variants that are more antigenically distinct (and their descendents) like Beta, Gamma (and other P clade variants) and Theta will get their turn."
2486,Is there any reason to think that natural immunity will be less effective than one of the vaccines?
2487,Paywall.
2488,Could someone post the content?
2489,This will be effective just as it’s always been.
2490,Australia soon will get its vaccination numbers up as well.
2491,The virus if it shows up again will be such low case numbers that contact tracing can protect everyone.
2492,Australia is doing things right in a world where everyone is doing things wrong.
2493,This study is barking up the wrong tree.
2494,"It doesn't appear to take into account
how many fewer vaccined people get the virus and how the virus is less
able to spread."
2495,That's the problem the virus is tackling.
2496,"There
are many viruses out there that kill people that we do not
need vaccines for because they aren't so virulent."
2497,There isn’t all we can do is try to mitigate the death toll.
2498,I'm fully vaxxed in Cali and my mask never came off.
2499,I had been keeping an eye on India and later the UK.
2500,"I've noticed a pattern that everytime cases go up in the UK, the US follows a month or two later."

2502,No shit Sherlock

2518,"While those who have caught the virus will have some level of immunity, there's no guarantee they will have the same level as those who have been vaccinated against it."
2519,In fact they may continue to be hosts and sources of new mutations.
2520,Combine this with vaccine break through events and we may be with this virus for a very long time.
2521,Might explain the uptick in diabetes.
2522,A lot of people in EU did.
2523,"When the recommendation was changed to only people over 60, everyone under 60 who had AZ first was allowed to change to Pfizer or Moderna for the second shot."

2620,"A short while ago, I posted the German government's delivery estimates for various vaccines for June and July: https://old.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/o16rr9/estimated_vaccine_deliveries_for_germany_for_june/h1z5uyo/

(Since all EU countries get their vaccines in equal shares relative to their population size, these estimates can be used as a basis for estimates for other countries as well.)"
2621,"**In light of Moderna's announcement this week that they will deliver more than anticipated in July, there are updated estimates from the German ministry for Health:**

For **July**, they expect 1.33 million doses of the **Moderna** vaccine per week (instead of the previous estimate of 733000 per week)."
2622,"And apparently Germany expects to receive 2.57 millionen doses of **Moderna** per week in **August**, and 2.95 millionen per week in **September**."
2623,"---

If these figures hold true, this would be a significant boost, as these numbers are on top of the sizeable Pfizer deliveries."
2624,"---

As noted before, there were no long-term predictions on J&amp;J (quality issues), and Astrazeneca (reliability issues)."
2625,The German article linked above now claims that the German government has received deliveries that will allow them to distribute 5 million doses of Astrazeneca and 1 million doses of J&amp;J to the state governments next week.
2626,"But it seems these are not regular, weekly deliveries, but just a one-off because that is what came through (with the aforementioned issues still ruling out future predictions)."

2656,Are there any updates on the blood clots linked to the J&amp;J vaccine?
2657,I already received my shot and I know its extremely rare but I find it weird that there hasn’t been an update since early May.
2658,Im really wondering how much cases there are.
2659,"OK, I'm not a doctor or scientist but I researched a lot about the covid vaccines in order to understand and also be able to discuss the details with anyone afraid of vaccines."
2660,"The way I understand it, companies make clinical trials with 2 groups."
2661,One take the vaccine and the other take a placebo.
2662,They monitor both groups for a set period of time and then test who suffered severe symptoms of covid on both sides.
2663,Then they take the percentage of those in each group and compare them.
2664,So by having results less than 100% means that some of the group that got the vaccine also got covid but it wasn't as severe (needing hospitalization) as the ones who got covid from the placebo group.
2665,And this is true for all vaccines.
2666,"They don't prevent infection, but compared to unvaccinated people they are x% effective in preventing symptoms."
2667,As far as I've read there are NO measurements at all for example for asymptomatic covid people.
2668,All these numbers are only true for those who got covid and actually suffered it's symptoms.
2669,&gt; it just turns out that the mRNA vaccines were way better than we ever anticipated.
2670,"...with a higher incidence of side effects, double the required doses, more complicated logistics, and less durable to earlier variants (the South Africa study)."
2671,anybody depending on the 'reasoning' of a social media hivemind to make medical decisions of consequence for themselves or their loved ones should think real hard about things.

2674,"In a few weeks it'll be significantly ahead of the ct, and wayyy ahead of the USA."

2699,Just an extra point that the blood donation has to test for the antibodies created by the vaccine.
2700,There may be other antibodies to the virus for which a vaccinated (mRNA) person may still test negative.

2739,"Per the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/vaers/index.html), the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is used to collect reports of adverse events after vaccination from the general public."
2740,This is primarily used to identify potential topics to further investigate with regards to vaccine reactions.
2741,"However, because the event data in VAERS is often not verified and is often self-reported, it should not be assumed that the adverse events in VAERS are actually associated with or cause by the vaccines, nor is it possible to estimate the frequency of these adverse events from these data."

2749,You also have to specify if you're a doctor or not and some other stuff.

2785,Yeah it's a serious question.
2786,I'm fully jabbed myself but I've seen people throw out quotes like yours but they include the entire sample size - not the age specific sample size for those as risk for the side effect.
2787,The former makes their concerns look foolish but when you look at the age specific numbers there's a definite correlation just like there was with the AZ jab and blood clots.
2788,Lasting a day?

2814,And if we don’t reach here immunity the virus may mutate to a point where the vaccine is less effective.
2815,Then a booster is created but if not enough people take it we are back in the same boat.
2816,Get vaccinated!
2817,"WSJ:
TEL AVIV—About half of adults infected in an outbreak of the Delta variant of Covid-19 in Israel were fully inoculated with the Pfizer Inc. vaccine, prompting the government to reimpose an indoor mask requirement and other measures to contain the highly transmissible strain."
2818,"Preliminary findings by Israeli health officials suggest about 90% of new infections were likely caused by the Delta variant, according to Ran Balicer, who leads an expert advisory panel on Covid-19 for the government."
2819,"Children under 16, most of whom haven’t been vaccinated, accounted for about half of those infected, he said."
2820,The number of cases in Israel is relatively low by global standards.
2821,But new cases of Covid-19 rose to over 200 on Thursday from around 10 a day for most of June.
2822,Israel is now reassessing its Covid-19 regulations after moving to open up its society and economy following multiple lockdowns last year.
2823,"“The entrance of the Delta variant has changed the transmission dynamics,” said Prof. Balicer, who is also the chief innovation officer for Israel’s largest health-management organization, Clalit."
2824,"The Delta variant, which first emerged in India in late 2020 and is also known as B.1.617.2, has now been detected in more than 70 countries."
2825,"These so-called breakthrough cases—defined as positive Covid-19 test results received at least two weeks after patients receive their final vaccine dose—are broadly expected as the Pfizer vaccine is highly effective but not 100% foolproof, according to Mr. Balicer."
2826,"Israeli health officials are optimistic that even if the variant does spread, evidence from countries such as the U.K. indicate the vaccine will prevent a large increase in severe illness and hospitalizations that plagued the country’s health system in previous outbreaks."
2827,"Israel has only recorded five severe cases in the past 10 days, Prof. Balicer said, but whether more will emerge is too early to tell."
2828,"Those exempt from the mask requirement included children under seven, people with disabilities that prevent them from wearing a mask or two workers who work regularly together."
2829,The government had canceled the indoor mask requirement 10 days ago and dropped most other preventive measures after running one of the world’s fastest vaccination campaigns.
2830,About 80% of Israelis of age 16 and above have received two doses of the vaccine that was developed by Pfizer and German partner BioNTech SE.
2831,Israel was an early test case for the effectiveness of the vaccine after outbreaks last year at one point gave it one of the world’s highest per-capita infection rates.
2832,"Since the start of the pandemic, 840,522 of the country’s 9.3 millions citizens have been infected, of which 6,429 died."
2833,"Israeli health officials said the highly contagious strain had likely entered the country through its main international airport, near Tel Aviv, where a system meant to vet every new arrival through testing was overloaded in recent days amid a surge in foreign travel."
2834,"On Wednesday, the government delayed allowing foreign nationals to enter into the country for tourism from July 1 to Aug. 1 and reimposed a mask requirement inside airports."
2835,"“Our goal at the moment, first and foremost, is to safeguard the citizens of Israel from the Delta variant that is running amok in the world,” Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said Wednesday."
2836,"I’m a KF94-er all the way, and mostly find them easier to talk in than cloth masks."
2837,"That said, I’m thinking face to face - over the phone is a whole different story and could see a more structured mask messing with the mic."
2838,I’m getting my second in a couple of days and don’t know where I’ll land when my area reaches herd immunity.
2839,I’m mask off outside unless it’s super crowded/on anywhere indoors (it’s still mandated in my city anyways)...but once I have antibodies and if the infection rates near me stay low?
2840,"I’ll prob always have my little mask pouch in my purse, and pop it on for public transit and crowded spaces."
2841,I miss lipstick but am so into this “not catching colds or viruses” thing.
2842,Just recently they said fully vaccinated people can’t get sick.
2843,They don’t know their ass from their elbow I’m not believing a damn thing.
2844,I’m vaccinated
2845,No it won't.
2846,Think of how many preventable diseases are covered.
2847,&gt;And you people are crying up a storm and acting like no one understands how hard it was for you.
2848,It was hard for all of us.
2849,Be an adult.
2850,Straight up.
2851,Foaming at the mouths at even the *suggestion* of continued mask use.
2852,I was out shopping at a couple stores today in a denier-heavy area.
2853,Maybe 5% mask use.
2854,Almost no kids masked despite this current variant being more dangerous for kids and the fact that we still don't understand long-term covid damage.
2855,"""But kids don't die!"""
2856,"Yeah, you could survive getting hit by a car too."
2857,You might also end up unable to walk the rest of your life.
2858,It's almost as if death isn't the only consequence.
2859,It's pathetic.
2860,They're willfully ignoring the basics of how *any* virus works.
2861,"Idk how the hell it's so hard to connect the dots (making up the numbers for sake of argument):

* Vaccine made, 95% effective
* Time passes, virus does what viruses do, and mutates
* Now the vaccine is 90% effective against new variants
* Time passes, virus mutates &lt;---- Where they stumble

After an undetermined amount of time we'd have a strain that the vaccine is only 85% effective against.. rinse and repeat until the vaccine is near useless or we hopefully develop a new vaccine."
2862,It doesn't take more than half a brain cell to see that current vaccines won't remain as effective against all future strains.
2863,We can't just make a simple tweak to vaccines and get them into everyone's arms instantly.
2864,Shit takes time.
2865,"Try to point this out and you get a bunch of jackasses saying, ""Oh studies say the vaccine is still pretty effective against current variants!"""
2866,Keyword there that they gloss over: CURRENT.
2867,The vaccines are effective but it might be a good idea to continue to reduce transmission so better vaccines can be made while current ones remain effective and before the virus gets a chance to mutate.
2868,It's a piece of fucking cloth.
2869,God damn I wish I had the energy to get this pissy over something so petty.
2870,"""Oh I've sacrificed a year, woe is me"" We all fucking have."
2871,Suck it up.

2880,Like ice cream and a functioning healthcare system
2881,Yeah I agree.
2882,"Too many people want to look to past variants to how we should react, but we really need to see how the new variants perform."
2883,And with Covid I think it’s better to be safe than sorry.
2884,"Whoever is going to be ridiculous and say “well we should all wear three masks then and shut everything down”, don’t bother, you know what I’m saying."
2885,Awesome to hear that Moderna is delivering significantly more vaccine!
2886,"This is probably also great news for the rest of Europe, since the vaccines are distributed evenly across all countries."
2887,"&gt; There is clear evidence that the Oxford vaccine, and other jabs, have been targeted by Russians peddling disinformation in order to promote their own version, Sputnik V."

2893,"I’ve only heard of like 28 cases, 6 men the rest women, seems to be within 3-10 days."
2894,Fewer people have gotten it after the pause so you are likely to hear fewer cases.
2895,But it’s likely a statistical outlier as far as side effects go and now they’ve started switching to mRNA you start seeing increases in reports of myocarditis which seems to be it’s rare side effect.
2896,I was extremely sick with covid prior to the vaccine being available.
2897,5 months later got the vaccine.
2898,My second doze of Pfizer hit me with a muted set of most of the same symptoms.
2899,Basically the same symptoms just with out the shortness of breath and chest pain.
2900,The only new symptom was a bit of a sore arm.
2901,But it was all very mild in comparison to the actual disease.
2902,Was it a fun shot and it’s side effects fun?
2903,No… but 100% worth it.
2904,It’s my personal theory that those who have the worst side effects from the vaccine likely would have the harsher effects of the disease.
2905,Covid vaccines aren't really something that comes up when dating.
2906,like I said - looking good right now - Delta R is -1.  but keeping an eye peeled for sure.
2907,how the fuck is voluntarily getting a vaccine that helps achieve herd immunity selfish
2908,I'm no anti-vaxxer but I struggle to understand: how come people get sick after the vaccine?
2909,Isn't that *exactly* what the vaccine is supposed to prevent?

3059,"I don't believe we have any concrete data on this yet (and I'm very curious to know as well), but I think it's probably safe to assume that it's very similar to hospitalizations and deaths - the risk is dramatically reduced, but not completely eliminated."
3060,"UK large used AZ vaccines which probably are less effective than Pfizer, Moderna and J&amp;J. J&amp;J being one dose was being handed out iN NYC subways a few times so if it’s counted as one dose it’s really considered complete."

3081,UGHHHH.
3082,People like you are why we will never get out of this mess.
3083,The vaccines are working wonderfully.
3084,Every single delta case in Israel that's been fully vaxxed showed no symptoms.
3085,Something like 40% of new cases were fully vaxxed people.
3086,"Vaccines are here to prevent serious disease, not to stop you from ever catching it."

3091,Seems to for the vast majority.
3092,Fingers crossed.
3093,Just had my first tasteless coffee.
3094,Blech.
3095,We already know the vast majority of all cases are among the unvaccinated; they do not need to state that.
3096,But the headline is still false.
3097,"Cases haven't doubled, it's the percentage of cases that are delta that has doubled in a 4-week period."
3098,"Since total cases have dropped very substantially in that timeframe, it's not clear that delta cases have risen at all."
3099,He also said young healthy people shouldn't get vaccinated.
3100,"Well, guess who are the ones spreading covid and breeding new variants now."
3101,As someone with small children....yes...yes it is....and it sucks....
3102,Somebody told me before I get vaccinated I should do more research.
3103,In my mind I was like ...
3104,I did research that’s why I got vaccinated.
3105,Anti Vaxxers boy I tell ya
3106,A lot of children are actually in summer school right now.
3107,In person.
3108,And many school districts have made masks optional for all kids and staff.
3109,I teach summer school.
3110,I’d say less than 5% of the students are wearing masks.

3112,"No one cares, it won’t cause mass deaths among the vaxxed."
3113,"No, it isn't."
3114,Not even close to being lockdown again - the link between cases and strain on the NHS is broken.
3115,Preach.
3116,&gt; It has NOT been helping my paranoia that my Pfizer shot didn't take... because I had the same issue with my hbv vaxx.
3117,"It makes me frustrated that most medical professionals don't explain this to everybody, or that it is not legally required to study/disclose."
3118,"During the pandemic, I think a ton of people have now been clued into these kinds of subtleties that have been widely ignored up until now."
3119,"To be explicit, for every single vaccine, if you finish the ""normal prescribed vaccine regiment"", there is a certain percentage of people that are not yet protected."
3120,"And in SOME of those cases, another shot of the identical vaccine at some later date would improve the chances of you being protected by some amount."
3121,"And in some smaller set of cases, they can test to see if you are immune."
3122,"Here is an example of this pet peeve of mine in action: The regular yearly flu vaccine is 40% - 60% effective and the 60% is if they guess the ""strains"" correctly that year."
3123,It goes as low as 13% effective if they guess the strains incorrectly like occurred in 2014-2015 flu season when multiple strains of H3N2 made people sick.
3124,"Now here is my question that I am yet to find an answer: if I got the yearly flu vaccination, then waited 6 weeks, then got the same vaccination AGAIN, would it: A) cause me some side effects I don't want, B) do nothing, or C) decrease my chances of getting the flu that year?"
3125,I cannot find the answer anywhere.
3126,"I've asked several doctors, they don't know."
3127,I can't find anything online about it.
3128,Here is just a little more information: there is a different flu vaccine formulation for people over 65 years old.
3129,"You can google ""Fluzone High Dose"", and the difference is it contains four times (!!!!)"
3130,the amount of antigen (the inactivated virus that promotes the immune response).
3131,"For people older than 65, this results in them getting the flu an ASTOUNDING 24% less of the time!"
3132,Now stay with me here: which one should you get if you are say 63 years old and all your life you tended to have weaker responses to things like the hepatitis B vaccine?
3133,I honestly have no idea.
3134,I am kind of excited by the new mRNA technology being applied to the flu vaccination.
3135,There are some article floating about with some bold claims that may or may not come true like an mRNA flu vaccine will last multiple years and be much more effective than the current flu vaccine.
3136,"Time will tell, a lot of this stuff gets thrown out there, and 10 years later it hasn't come to market."
3137,Both my parents got COVID last week after being fully vaccinated.
3138,Fortunately the symptoms were very mild.
3139,Someone in a Facebook group I’m in for the service industry is selling fake covid test results.
3140,Who/where should I report this to?
3141,I’m in GA if that matters.

3153,"Unless you're medically trained and can make an informed decision from reading a study into this, if there have been any, you shouldn't take the risk, no matter how small you perceive it to be."
3154,Where does this end though?
3155,"There will always be new variants, covid will not disappear."
3156,"Once majority are vaccinated, it should be back to normal."
3157,Just hold on a few more weeks.
3158,Sorry.
3159,That's not going to cut it anymore once everyone who wants a vaccine has been offered one.
3160,"Of all the new delta cases in Israel, 40% were fully vaccinated, of these none of them showed any symptoms."
3161,"The goal of vaccines is to stop serious disease, not to stop you from ever catching it."
3162,"At some point we have to start accepting risk in life and also accept that covid is here to stay forever, just like H1N1 is still here today as a flu that was the Spanish Flu."

Even Singapore is starting to realise that covid is here to stay."
3164,"I've got to disagree, things may be looking good when you only look at the overall number of cases."
3165,"But looking at Delta cases in Ontario, they are staying roughly constant (R is equal to 1)."
3166,With any further loosening of the restrictions R will exceed 1 and Canada will start following the UK trajectory.
3167,Canada is definitely not out of the woods yet.
3168,It all comes down to incentive.
3169,"When community transmission is basically zero, there's no compelling ""what's in it for me?"""

3171,"If the virus was running rampant, then it would change the ""what's in it for me?"""
3172,case.
3173,"But as long as cases remain low, a lot of people won't want it."
3174,"Some people have posted their results for anti body tests after infection and had zero, everyone is different."
3175,"Also, have you read about the vaccines?"
3176,It is said they’re way more effective than having the virus.
3177,Israel is having major outbreaks… go figure.
3178,I did and they said no.
3179,"I got my first shot, and then 3-ish weeks later, I got another first shot."
3180,I’m guessing I’m not the only one.
3181,Yes thankfully the issue was resolved peacefully.
3182,States are actually listening to their residents' concerns.
3183,"It was hard to believe it would happen anyways, something of this scale would take a year while many were already anticipating a return to mostly normal by summer."
3184,"&gt;	At what point will the government have to say “ok at this point if you have not been vaccinated that is your problem, we are moving on.”

Sure, but COVID illness causes measurable costs to public institutions like state hospitals and economic production."
3185,"We just wrapped up four years of Donald blabbing about the stock market every day, so clearly the federal government is in the business of ensuring continued economic growth - minimizing the impact of a dangerous virus through getting vaccines in arms is in that interest."

3193,"With how wide open it is in the United States, has it gotten lucky so far with delta?"
3194,"&gt;Dude, it doesn't."
3195,As one of the older millennials I hoped and prayed we would loose a lot of bigotry and stupidity as older people died.
3196,"We didn't, this stuff isn't generational."
3197,"Sure, acceptance shifts as time goes on, but there are plenty of younger people that believe in hate."

3207,Sorry had to fix it so it didn't get auto banned.
3208,Blatant misinformation.
3209,It does.
3210,"What most people seem to fail to understand about infections is that it’s a probability game: Even if both, you and the person next to you wear a mask, if the person next to you is spreading the virus, you could end up infected - it’s just very unlikely."
3211,Adding just a little distance significantly reduces the probability.
3212,"One person removing the mask increases the probability, both removing the mask increases it a lot more."
3213,Having a healthy immune system decreases the probability.
3214,If the person spreading it only spreads a very low dose (i.e.
3215,"contagious phase is almost over), your immune system may prevent an infection within you even noticing (or becoming contagious yourself)."
3216,"The thing with probabilities is that if you multiply an extremely low probability with 7 billion people, it could still by thousands more dieing."
3217,"That’s why, in a pandemic situation, we do things that would be considered paranoid in non-pandemic situations."
3218,You simply don’t want to be responsible for someone else’s death (or suffering e.g.
3219,long Covid) because you ended up on the bad side of a low probability.

3342,People don’t think COVID19 is real?
3343,That’s not true for the vast vast majority.
3344,"I think the answer is that for some reason communicable disease causes a lot more hysteria, and public health authorities are tuned into this."
3345,"Same with terrorism, which causes relatively few deaths, yet countries spend enormous amounts to fight it."
3346,"The opioid epidemic has killed about half a million Americans, but the response is just some mild lawsuits against the companies that know full well that most of their products hit the black market."
3347,"Nosocomial infections kill 100k Americans every year, despite it being preventable."
3348,"Non-communicable disease kills far and away more than anything else, but there’s no effort to tax sugar or remove escalators to promote exercise, etc."
3349,"Yet for COVID19 we’re willing to drastically limit freedoms, shut down businesses, obligate mask wearing, and spend more money than all of WWII (in constant dollars)."
3350,The contrast is pretty striking for a disease that mostly hits people near the end of their lives.
3351,"eg the opioid epidemic + obesity has had a much bigger impact of American life expectancy than COVID19, which makes the US the only developed country in the world to see its life expectancy flattened or even dropping starting around 2014."

3359,I could have written this myself down to the small details.
3360,Also decided it was a cold so began treatment for that.
3361,Could smell some stuff but definitely lost if for a good day or two.
3362,At that point I began googling whether I could even get covid or the new variant having been fully vaccinated in February.
3363,"Everything seemed to tell me no, it must be a cold."
3364,Cool.
3365,So I didn’t get tested.
3366,Now I’m beginning to feel better but this cough lingers.
3367,I have made it this entire pandemic without once having a covid test.
3368,Is there any reason to at this point since I feel 90% better?
3369,It's also worth noting that many localities made it illegal to cover your face.
3370,"This was obviously to counter robbers and such, but it was still a law."
3371,"Not covering your face is deeply ingrained into our society, it says you have something to hide."
3372,"So it would make sense that most common stores didn't sell masks, who was covering their face?"
3373,"\&gt;The UK

The UK has tons and tons of unvaccinated people due to how they structured their vaccination program, they stratified it by age."
3374,"Yeah, I see mostly Gen X and millennials refusing (though still a minority of both)."
3375,"Admittedly, I don't know a ton of older people besides family, but the ones I do all got vaccinated."
3376,I am pretty sure vaccination statistics more or less back this up too.
3377,I don’t think California allows religious or personal exemptions for vaccines…or does that only apply to minors?

3379,"Well, COVID itself can cause myocarditis."

3387,"&gt;and vaccinated people getting sick 

Vaccinated people have been turning up asymptomatic or with colds at worst, same as with other breakthrough infections from other types of COVID."
3388,The concern should always be for the unvaccinated.
3389,"That'd mean admitting that he lied about how serious the virus was and having to explain why he said he was immune after he caught it, and he'd never do that :/ he dug himself too deep and he cares way more about his image than saving people's lives"
3390,"Aw, you never know."
3391,The factory should have been careful with you and the materials anyway.
3392,I wish I knew that fanning tip when I was a kid searching my house for the source of a foul smell and zeroed in on my brother's sneaker.
3393,No
3394,I don't think any of the statistics available so far specifically measure the incidence of long covid in vaccinated people.
3395,"On the other hand, we don't know what longlasting effects their are from covid and how those kids infected will be affected when they're older."
3396,"Anecdotally, as an older Gen Xer, I think it's mostly lots of people across the spectrum."

3398,I'm not wrong though.
3399,Covid is here to stay forever just as H1N1 is still here today from what was the Spanish Flu
3400,Yea I enjoy a reasonable commute.
3401,"Probably people commuting 30+ minutes would prefer to stay at home, but so what?"
3402,Let those who want to come into the office come in.
3403,Jeez.
3404,"Maybe you'll be excluded from a few things, but that's probably the norm for you anyways."
3405,"Also, you don't have to be so concerned about employers shelling out for office spaces."
3406,They're not going anywhere - I guarantee it.
3407,Shared workspaces are trending even for people who want to work remotely so they don't have to stuck at home alone all day.

3430,These complications are rare and flu isn't as virulent.

3494,Thanks for doing the right thing!
3495,It took me about 5 weeks to get any sense of smell at all back.
3496,After that I slowly climbed back to about 80% of what it used to be.
3497,"At that point, certain smells would have a strange artificial smoky smell."
3498,"I got it with cheese, toast, coffee and lots of other things."
3499,This negatively impacted the taste too.
3500,That persisted for 6 months but I’ve very recently got the final 20% back and I almost cried because cheese tastes normal again.
3501,"That's not how it works, you're not going to just have a super virus that evades the vaccine automatically."
3502,That's not a given.

3531,An advantage that some states have is that they have more young people vaccinated who are the ones most likely to increase transmission.
3532,"Since you mainly socialise within your age group, that means there's much less potential for the chain to be broken in the UK."

3541,I mean they had some technical jargon where the antibody test doesn’t look for all of the antibodies that the vaccine creates.
3542,It’s a better indicator of if you’ve had Covid in the past then if the vaccine worked.
3543,Everyone is so dramatic - it drives me crazy.
3544,How about this?
3545,Use common sense and be thoughtful.
3546,Is that so difficult?
3547,Carry a mask in your pocket.
3548,If you visit a business and they don't require masks and you don't want to wear one - leave it in your pocket.
3549,"If you wear a business and they request that you wear a mask, put on the mask, or don't visit the business and then go about your day."

3561,You are spot on and of course being down voted because of it.
3562,"People don't realize the danger in ""let the antivaxers get covid"" means that it gives the virus more chance to mutate."
3563,That spike protein only has to mutate so much before the vaccines are ineffective.

3581,It’s not precise enough to state percentage of the population that was vaccinated.
3582,We need to also contextualize with the type of vaccine.
3583,"Chile used mostly Sinovac, which doesn’t work as well as mRNA overall and especially with Delta."
3584,But the UK’s reliance on AZ is also an issue.
3585,"Yes, AZ prevents most hospitalization and death with Delta, but is less apt at preventing transmission than mRNA shots."
3586,Hence all the cases in the UK.
3587,"For countries with either two mRNA or one AZ followed by an mRNA (Canada), they will have far less transmission with Delta than the examples you cited."
3588,The vaccines work.
3589,"To curb spread and prevent deaths/hospitalizations, though, mRNA leads the pack."
3590,"People got addicted to lockdowns, restrictions and masks full stockolm syndrome mode, and want it to happen or something."
3591,That looks like a regular vest with lots of pockets that someone told him was bulletproof.
3592,"&gt; Even flu is difficult to effectively vaccinate against since we don't know which flu viruses will be introduced during the flu season

This might be (hopefully) changing, as there was a study done in 2019 that found our bodies are highly cross-reactive to influenza strains, but current (as of 2019) vaccines did not target the correct immune response, and so we end up having to play whack-a-mole with influenza strains."
3593,"Based on that paper if we start targeting different immune responses to more correctly mimic a natural immune response, we might actually be able to vaccinate against influenza as a whole."
3594,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5890936/

Of course, then we would run the problem that tons of people would refuse to get the flu vaccine and we'd inevitably end up with a strain that broke through the vaccine."

3618,But you have to keep in mind that 100% of people given the vaccine weren't exposed to covid.
3619,It was only a fraction of that.
3620,Only a true exposure study would give us our individual chances of getting covid after vaccine.
3621,Then what was the point of getting the vaccine?

3642,Thanks.
3643,They basically said I have to trust the vaccine and I don’t need another dose.
3644,That might change when the cdc or fda change their guidelines but right now I can’t get another dose.
3645,So I’m basically stuck waiting to see if things change.
3646,I’m hanging out with vaccinated friends at their places again but that’s the extent of my going back to normal.
3647,My life will likely never go back to normal because of the unvaccinated.
3648,Are the flu shot side effects as gnarly as the covid vax?
3649,"My answer is actually yes, not that you or i agree with them."
3650,"I think that they are worried about others but believe since they are vaccinated and are extremely unlikely to conteact or be a carrier that they feel safe to do what they do, that it's not harming anyone."
3651,Even with everyone wearing masks and sanitizing constantly there was a higher chance of getting it unvaccinated with everyone doing that than vaccinated returning to normal.
3652,"Also have to take into account how long people have been spent up, unable to do the normal things."
3653,So I think yes they do care and that they feel them getting vaccinated is the best and most they could do.
3654,Yep.

3930,&gt; Delta is 50% more infectious and 60% more deadly then that.
3931,That's literally bullshit.
3932,There is no evidence of this... [They said that about the Kent variant in December but then in March concluded it was no more dangerous than the original strain.

3935,People are horrible at math.
3936,Remember that all the covid deniers say “it has a 99% survival rate” there is nothing on earth the average person would do willingly if they had a 1% chance of dying on average.
3937,Skydiving has a .006% fatality rate per jump just as a comparison.
3938,You don't lose your taste and smell permanently from covid.
3939,The article said something like 98.5% of patients get their smell back
3940,Try telling that to us in the UK 🤷‍♀️
3941,I'm not sure Fox would give an unbiased broadcast of that if they did.
3942,I wouldn't be so sure to be honest.
3943,I wonder how it will play out in other countries.
3944,"For example, in Poland, which is where I am, the vaccination plan is different."
3945,"Unlike UK, we have vaccinated all age groups, so this scenario is unlikely, as most people infected there are in their 20s and haven't had a chance to get their vaccinations yet."
3946,"I expect a bump in cases, probably around August or September but it will most likely be insignificant."
3947,"No problem - it is a \*little\* pedantic, in that most of the world has always conflated Britain and England."
3948,Even we used to!
3949,Just FYI that the antibodies checked after blood donations may not be the same neutralizing antibodies that are produced after vaccination (they are usually checking for the IgG antibodies that are produced after infection).
3950,I would check and make sure that the test being run actually covers the antibodies that you are looking for.
3951,America is not the Worlds personal piggy bank
3952,Im not eligible to donate due to a genetic blood disorder.. what do I do lol
3953,"It's not that cases are reduced by 95%, you can still get it."
3954,It just means your body fights it off faster and better.
3955,There are multiple efficacy ratings for each vaccine.
3956,"One for mild symptoms, one for moderate symptoms, one for serious, and death."
3957,The 95% efficacy is attributed to preventing serious symptoms and death.
3958,The percentages for stopping the mild symptoms is lower.

4015,I just got my first Pfizer today (got johnsoned in March) and I plan to get my second dose in 3 weeks.
4016,"I’m doing this for a few reasons—primarily, it’s that my motivation for getting an mRNA in the first place was because there’s a lot more data available on Pfizer vs. variants."
4017,"The data says two doses of Pfizer is a lot better than one, but basically no data exists (yet) on 1pfizer+1other, which means getting only one dose would effectively leave me with the same problem as before."
4018,There’s a vaccine surplus in my area and my side effects are always manageable so I really don’t see any reason not to get the second dose.

4079,"&gt;Comparing absolute amounts is not what matters here (in comparing the definition of ""a link"")."
4080,It is one trend following another.
4081,I would argue we're at the point where absolute numbers are what we **should** be using and percentages are now causing unwarranted anxiety.
4082,"The baseline rates for cases, hospitalizations, and deaths has dropped so far that even small numerical changes have significant percentile impacts in trailing data."

4087,"We don’t know that if you have antibody levels above some threshold that you are unlikely to be infected, and if it’s below you are likely to be effective."
4088,In HIV for example you can get a drug approved because it lowers viral load.
4089,You cannot get a vaccine approved based on antibody response alone because we have not established this connection definitively.

4098,Simple 'surgical-like' or cloth masks doe provide added protection.

4122,The same article that's linked on this page says according to the latest data most people have their senses back after a year.
4123,"&gt;""At eight months, objective olfactory assessment confirmed full recovery in 49 of 51 patients (96.1%),"" they wrote."
4124,Two continued to have an abnormal sense of smell a year later -- one who couldn't smell much and another who had an abnormal smell sense.
4125,"""Our findings suggest that an additional 10% gain in recovery can be expected at 12 months, compared with studies with 6 months of follow-up that found only 85.9% of patients with recovery""."
4126,Question.
4127,So I had my first COVID shot today (Moderna) and I took DayQuil around 6 hours before because I was feeling a bit wack.
4128,I didn’t realize that I shouldn’t take OTC medicine before/after the shot.
4129,"Will this reduce the effectiveness of the vaccine, anyone know?"

4142,"Yes, and my Southern Albertan city only has a vaccination rate of 58%."
4143,So irritating.
4144,Data from the trials showed no difference in efficacy between those with side effects and those without.
4145,"""Side effects means it's working"" is a comforting not-exactly-lie."
4146,It works either way.
4147,I thought the vaccine purpose was you can still get sick from any covid but it just won't be severe...
4148,I'm confused
4149,This was my thought too.
4150,"They say the vaccines are 90-something percent effective... hence, there are some who can/will still get sick."
4151,That's why it's 90-something percent and not 100%.
4152,This article is redundant and a waste of effort/time.
4153,Yo I legit got 2 colds in the span of a month this year.
4154,Shit sucks man
4155,&gt;What I want to know is what happens to those of us that cannot get vaccinated because of an allergy?
4156,Vaxx or mask seems like the easy answer.
4157,Can’t or won’t prove you were vaxxed?
4158,Please wear a mask to enter this establishment.
4159,"So any pharmacy/location will give a booster of mRNA on request, or is there an official way to go about this?"
4160,It’s not just about the deaths.
4161,"I believe the virologists are talking about 88% becoming 78%, 68%, 58%, etc ... even a reduction into the mid to low 70% range would result in quite a few more infections, more hospitalizations, and yeah more deaths."
4162,Nobody is saying that the protection will go from 88% to 0%.
4163,It must be an awful feeling to have that level of hate festering inside them.
4164,But I'm having some trouble feeling sorry for them over it.
4165,I do feel sorry for the people they hurt.
4166,"Shouldn't the word emperor be in quotes, too?"
4167,I think cases will raise in the summer but because of the lower starting point a bigger surge will happen in the fall.
4168,Or maybe delta will hit us hard.
4169,We will only have between 61% to 65% of our population fully vaxed.
4170,Alberta is the the least vaxxed province except for Saskatchewan.
4171,The side effects are generally similar to just feeling tired and feverish for a day so they could be any random bug.
4172,Here’s something cool...  Last week a person at work who had Covid a few months ago asked me (I’m a retail store manager) how long non-vaccinated folks would be required to wear masks.
4173,"I told her that our company was following CDC guidelines and that while vaccinated folks don’t need to wear a mask, non-vaccinated folks do and that I expected it would continue until the CDC said non-vaccinated folks can take off the masks."

4300,My sense of smell was 100% gone for 2 or 3 weeks and it 100% returned.
4301,And I’m not young.
4302,I'm from a country close to Australia where AZ was once made opt-in and the system has malfunctioned from people desperate to get a vaccine.
4303,We would greatly appreciate more AZ doses.
4304,Is this how you manage 3-yr olds?
4305,"I dunno, I don't have kids."
4306,I was eager to get my first shot.
4307,However I had awful side effects including heart issues that I've never experienced before.
4308,This was a terrifying experience and the second shot is said to cause even worse side effects.
4309,[removed]
4310,They tested it with two and with one and ended up going with one dose because they didn’t see a big enough difference to warrant the second shot right away.
4311,It isn’t just randomly a one shot vaccine.

4314,Not available in my area.

4318,ca cell is a soup.
4319,try to do a measurement on your potato in your soup while making sure that the results are not affected by the tomatoes and rice present in the same soup
4320,It's more about scaring people that are vaccinated for no reason.
4321,Pfizer and the rest of the vaccines in the USA protect against delta.
4322,Scaring people doesn't help anyone.
4323,This is vaccine cheerleading bordering on dishonesty.
4324,"Cool stuff, it's a 1st generation vaccine."
4325,But if anything the criticism didn't actually hit in the UK.
4326,Will this ever end?
4327,I do live in the US.
4328,I did not know about the study.
4329,This is my biggest fear with people who won’t get vaccinated or continue with precautions.
4330,"Right now, we have a path to eradicate Covid."
4331,"Get everybody vaccinated, and the disease will disappear."
4332,"Every time the disease infects someone, there’s a chance that it mutates."
4333,One mutation that changes it sufficiently so that the vaccine doesn’t work anymore and we’re back to global shutdown.

4352,"I remember reading that when the WHO authorized the Sinovac vaccine they said they found out it was not very effective on older people, I could be wrong though, but I’m sure some countries that used the Sinovac vaccine, like the UAE are offering a third jab with the Pfizer vaccine to increase the number of antibodies."
4353,"But yeah it’s too soon and jumping to conclusions would be wrong, I hope the Chinese vaccine is effective enough against the delta variant or it will be a huge problem for a lot of people"
4354,You have absolutely zero evidence to say that we are at the start of our biggest peak yet.
4355,I waited 3 months to get my second dose.
4356,"Not because I didn’t want it, I did."
4357,"But I have an extreme fear of needles and kept putting it off, was easy to do when the people who gave me the first dose said I would have to restart the series because I waited too long."
4358,"When I spoke to my doctor, they said they were full of shit."
4359,But the delta variant scared me enough that I forced myself to make my appointment.
4360,Now I wait 2 weeks to be mostly immune to it.
4361,Some people just can’t do needles and have to force themself into it..

4382,Press (X) to doubt
4383,He is clearly talking about within the United States
4384,We’ll yeah that’s in-line with what we expect isn’t it.
4385,The vaccines aren’t 100% effective.
4386,Not sure what is false about what they said?
4387,Doing some basic math here about 150 million people are fully vaccinated in the US.
4388,So that would mean with this data .00002% are hospitalized or dying from COVID after being fully vaccinated.
4389,If you can’t feel safe with those numbers then a lot of things in life should be much more terrifying than COVID.
4390,First time uh ?
4391,The company my wife works for had 12 people out at once with it.
4392,That's about 75% of the whole company.
4393,All of them too sick to work.
4394,I really don't think you are right about most cases being asymptomatic.
4395,Hope you feel better soon.
4396,I'm sure you know this but rest and stay hydrated.
4397,I've gotten the flu when I've been vaccinated and it was much less severe
4398,I hope these companies deliberately exposing us all to the variant have liability for it.

4402,Costco just read this and brought back their mask mandate ... not.
4403,"Arenas at NBA games are looking pretty full, few masks, and of course a healthy percentage unvaccinated still."
4404,So who thinks any of this will change in the US at all in response to this recent info from WHO?
4405,Even if we do get another (smaller) outbreak from the delta?
4406,People really need to stop saying this.
4407,The vaccine side effects legitimately caused me to be on death’s doorstep.
4408,I was clotting and bleeding out and lost just under half of the blood in my body.
4409,"I’m not cool with the temporary protection I received from the vaccine that will wear off before I can actually go anywhere or do anything due to being immunocompromised especially since I’m also stuck spending most of this time recovering from a surgery and needing to have another surgery all as a result of said vaccine… For the average person, yes, it’s fine, but, for those of us that have extreme side effects, I legitimately wish I had never gotten it."
4410,"I’m still stuck having to take the same preventative measures as before and basically be a damn invalid since the rest of my city, state, and country still won’t take a pandemic seriously."
4411,"&gt;you lose all credibility as an organization when you flip flop or send conflicting messages 

Yes, exactly, I think that's why the CDC's message that social distancing and other measures can now be abandoned was such a huge error."
4412,"We had spent a year of hard work establishing new social norms in the United States, with people finally wearing masks to a certain extent and businesses enforcing social distancing inside their establishments."
4413,"That was a real accomplishment, saved a lot of lives, and was not something to be abandoned lightly."
4414,"The CDC announcement is already starting to look premature, and the WHO yesterday backed away from this and advised continued masking and social distancing for everyone (another flip-flop!)."
4415,"Cases in the UK now are doubling every week, the classic exponential growth pattern."
4416,"Everyone (even governors and the head of the CDC) loves being the bearer of good news, I get that, but part of being a responsible adult is to keep the longer view in mind and be able to delay gratification for the sake of the greater good."
4417,Yeah hard pass there chief.

4441,"750 people have died after being fully vaccinated, 140 of those being completely asymptomatic or unrelated to covid."
4442,76% of the fully vaccinated people who have been hospitalized or died have been 65+.
4443,Anyone with a lick of common sense can see that these numbers mean the vaccines are extremely good at doing their jobs.
4444,We’ve had millions receive their full vaccinations and out of those millions we are seeing minuscule hospitalizations and death in the grand scheme.
4445,To think that nobody would ever die or be hospitalized of covid again is a pipe dream.
4446,All we’ve heard this entire time was flatten the curve and keep the medical system from collapsing.
4447,We’ve done that and continue to do that.
4448,"President Biden himself is hosting a celebration with 1,000 guests at the White House next weekend to ""celebrate our independence from COVID"" as if this is all over."
4449,The problem is that most people (especially in the US where we tend to be more focused on individual wants) just want life to return to the way it was before March 2020 and that's completely understandable.
4450,"The problem with this mentality is that COVID is unpredictable ... the straight talk should be ""we don't know when it will be safe to go to a gym without a mask or go to a crowded nightclub"" but people don't want to hear that."
4451,"The other downside is that because of the overly rosy messaging from Biden, the CDC, etc it's going to be very, very hard to get people to wear masks again much less accept business capacity limits or God forbid a stay at home order."
4452,Once again everyone starts singing a different tune when hospitals get overwhelmed and deaths go up.
4453,"In my country of origin in Eastern Europe we had a similar sentiment in the beginning of this year no more masks or lockdowns no matter what, protesters everywhere, as soon as hospitalizations and deaths went up everyone masked up quietly and stayed home."
4454,When did you get your M.D.?

4458,"Glad to live in British Columbia, where competent minors can seek their own healthcare if their parents won't do it for them."
4459,Kids as young as 12 or 13 can consent to their own vaccinations (including MMR/Gardasil/COVID/Tetanus/etc... ) and there's no requirement to inform their parents.
4460,They just have to speak with a medical provider first.
4461,"Nice try, Grzegorz Brzęczyszczykiewicz"
4462,Yep.
4463,If people focus on cases and only cases then there will be restrictions forever.
4464,We definitely want cases reduced and they are important but we can’t make cases alone the defining metric on if we implement lockdowns and masks.
4465,"Yes, that’s a big reason why SARS-CoV-1 was easier to stop than SARS-CoV-2."
4466,My best friends dad had him after 50.
4467,It might not be incredibly common but it's not that unheard of.
4468,Several people I grew up with had parents that chose not to have kids until their late 30s early 40s.

4474,I’m really sorry to hear this.
4475,I hope you guys eventually sort it out.
4476,I’m super glad you got vaccinated.
4477,In reply to your situation: boomers in my country are pretty highly vaccinated in comparison to younger people (greater than 70% have at least one shot and large numbers are getting second shots each day).
4478,"The older someone is, the more likely they are to be vaccinated."
4479,"Yah, except some parents have very reasoned position for not wanting their children vaccinated for COVID and their teenagers are still minors."
4480,Completely inexcusable to be setting up methods for teenagers to circumvent their parents consent.
4481,The ones at risk are all vaccinated though.
4482,"Children will certainly catch it, but you think people will protest over Timmy 8 years old getting the sniffles?"

4484,"If it is not *their* life, they will not care or comply."
4485,"Without state enforcement, it cannot be required and there are too many state governments opposing reasonable health measures to hope for that."
4486,They aren't allowing  large events like we are.
4487,God save you from a mild cold which you MIGHT get it if you're vaccinated...
4488,"Lol, we'll get right on that 🙄"
4489,Many unvaccinated people are from countries where vaccines are still scarce.
4490,Even if they want they can’t get a jab.
4491,Some people are immunocompromised or too sick to and need to visit hospitals for specialized checkups and equipment.
4492,"Lot of people are so on the edge the cannot get time off if they get symptoms from
The vaccines."
4493,"Show a little heart man, it doesn’t cost anything."
4494,It's all good people are on the edge and they can't imagine the prospect of more masks and lockdowns.
4495,I totally understand the reactions.
4496,Unfortunately we probably won't have much choice.
4497,These things will come and go in cycles until this virus become endemic hopefully sooner than later.
4498,"Everyone is tested heavily, the problem is if someone is newly exposed to something they may have yet to have developed a detectable amount of antibodies."
4499,The waiting period is to give that time for antibodies to develop.
4500,The basis was that the vaccine was available and it was up to people to use their own judgment on what they want to do.
4501,Many stores kept the mask mandates until April or May anyway.
4502,Very similar to the dheese strain.
4503,"You are reading it wrong, or rather the reporting is vague and confusing."
4504,Most of the infections in Israel are among the unvaccinated.
4505,Those who are vaccinated and test positive are largely asymptomatic.
4506,Those who are symptomatic have very mild symptoms.
4507,The mRNA vaccines still work very well.
4508,They are not 100% like any vaccine so you will still have some hospitalizations and deaths.
4509,At least one other person gets it!
4510,Thank you
4511,I would humbly suggest public policy that imagines the effects of a global pandemic remaining isolated to individual regions is part of what got us into this mess.

4533,A small percentage of vaccinated people are still going to get covid.

4549,And what prescriptions exactly are pharmacies filling for infectious diseases?
4550,Who was going to a pharmacy knowing they had COVID vs. going anywhere else?
4551,COVID wasn't primarily spread at pharmacies *obviously*.

4564,What a bad situation.
4565,They won't turn against them if hospitalizations and deaths go up.
4566,There will be protests like before but most people will fall in line to save lives.
4567,"Especially considering 150 million people in the US alone are unvaccinated, including children 12 and under."
4568,Unfortunately it sorta does.
4569,"If you cannot convince the population to take the mask mandate seriously, enforcement and compliance will be low."

4573,Because dictating public policy and messaging is exactly their job.
4574,"For more information on the above comment, read the very entertainingly written book “The Premonition” by Michael Lewis"
4575,You should really do some research on how far your viral particles can spread in a restaurant.
4576,I assure you that you’re not protecting anyone by wearing a mask for the 10 second walk to the restroom while leaving it off to eat your meal; your germs are constantly spreading throughout that entire restaurant while you eat anyway.
4577,"People are conveniently forgetting to mention that the majority (I actually think in this smaller sample size, all) of those vaxxed patients are completely asymptomatic."
4578,Someone feel free to correct me if I'm wrong
4579,What the public wants dictate the effectiveness of mask mandates and other interventions to contain the variant.
4580,Health Experts are useless if the public turns against them.
4581,"Yeah right 

At the slightest mutation WHO will gladly be ringing alarms 

Fact they are still telling fully vaccinated people to mask up and distance is proof of that despite the virus extremely rarely effecting these people"

4585,Apparently yep.
4586,[removed]
4587,Because pharmacies are places where medications are distributed to sick people and thus it makes sense that most of the people there at any given time could very likely have an infectious illness.
4588,Is this a serious question?
4589,"Like do you not understand that certain places are much, much more likely to have higher concentrations of ill people because they’re literally designed for ill people?"
4590,&gt; That number is TINY if you put it into context.
4591,Exactly.
4592,People don't know how to use their brains.

4625,The vaccines are 88% effective against Delta.
4626,What good are effective vaccines if they don't get us back to normal?
4627,It is broken down by the body and gone within a week.
4628,Stop overdramatizing getting a vaccine and just care about your neighbors lol
4629,I'd rather Google.
4630,[removed]
4631,Vaccines ARE the precautions.
4632,"Masks were like putting a finger in a leaky dam, and only worked when paired with social distancing."
4633,Vaccines are like actually repairing the crack with cement.
4634,"You're now suggesting we take additional precautions by placing our fingers over the cement ""just in case"" it fails, because what's the harm right?"
4635,"I'll pass, thanks."
4636,"""Freedom, patriot, assault weapon firing automatic gunfire into the sky, eagle screaming mask suggestion"""
4637,Anti-Communist Duty would work too
4638,Those folks would be in a better position if not for the stupid :(
4639,Vaccines are very powerful but not perfect.
4640,"They provide almost (but not quite) perfect protection against hospitalization/death, and strong protection against getting sick at all, or transmitting the virus."
4641,We know vaccinated people are much less likely to spread it but some countries are being very conservative about which new evidence they accept.
4642,Young people aren't getting strokes from the vaccine in any remotely significant amount.
4643,In fact I can't even find any reports of them... it's all about myocarditis which is rare and rarely serious.
4644,"They are far far more likely to be getting strokes from Covid itself (which is still super rare but we are talking the tail end of the tail end here), as stated by a professor who did a study on the rare occasion of serious vaccine complications: ""it is important to remember that these side-effects are rare, and much less common than both cerebral venous thrombosis and ischaemic stroke associated with covid-19 infection itself"""
4645,"Alternatively, I have family in a state that did almost nothing, while the state I live in was one of the more strict."
4646,They like to believe they kept their freedoms while I was like some sort of caged animal.
4647,"I don’t have the heart to point out to them that while they continued to bust their ass working for shit wages, I got to enjoy working from home, making a liveable wage, working on myself, finding new skills, getting delicious take-out that isn’t Applebees, and the fact that I still had more choices for things to do during lockdown than I ever did living “free” in that state."
4648,Also they all got covid.
4649,Luckily everyone is fine-save for lack of taste and probably even less common sense.
4650,Kinda deceptive - the states have very low populations but most of those people live in just a few places.
4651,"In South Dakota, half the population lives in just seven (out of 66) counties (Minnehaha, Pennington, Lincoln, Brown, Brookings, Codington and Meade)."
4652,"In North Dakota, half the population lives in just six (out of 53) counties (Cass, Burleigh, Grand Forks, Ward, Morton and Stark)."
4653,"making it a law is fine, but retail workers are already scared to enforce mask mandates because covidiots also tend to be gun carrying jerks, and some people have been injured or killed trying to enforce them."
4654,"then the police get involved, which may not have good results….or there’s just the law enforcement officials who flat out say they refuse to …."
4655,enforce.
4656,"good times, usa."
4657,we’re already gonna lose more people in the south / rural areas because of high resistance to the vaccines.
4658,"If the new normal means no sporting events, concerts, indoor dining, movies, theatres, museums, haircuts, gyms then no thanks!"
4659,J and J is decently effective against Beta and all studies show Delta having less evasion than Beta.
4660,Probably somewhere around 60-65% effective.
4661,Are you going to wear a mask for the rest of your life to protect people from any and every contagious disease out there?
4662,At some point the risk is low enough that masks are not needed.
4663,In the US we are at that point.
4664,"Yeah I always wonder if those people in like 1941 would have been saying ""that's it we tried not being invaded and covering all our lights at night to avoid being bombed but we are just going to have to live with it""

I'm not saying covid has been that bad but the idea that either things go back to normal in a couple months or you give up is just sad."
4665,Maybe for the countries who opted for Made in China vaccines
4666,Only stupid people will obey another lockdown.
4667,"Lot of people are vaccinated and a lot of these people won't care are at all, including me."
4668,Such as?
4669,Username checks out
4670,Frame it as a way to own the left and the right will jump all over it.
4671,That's not how science works.
4672,"While it's possible your family is truly unreasonable, it's also worth weighing the fact that humans are hilariously terrible at intuiting meaning from statistical findings."
4673,Often ignorance can manifest as fear because we know enough to know we don't understand the full consequences of our actions but we don't feel equipped to answer the questions such realization brings.
4674,In the UK no one is prohibited from all of the vaccines on health grounds and the UK health regulator says theres a chance the vaccine is more harmful to kids health than the virus so it's unethical to vaccinate them just to boost herd immunity.
4675,"I'm sorry but if you are double vaxxed, people choose not to get vaccinated and kids will never get vaccinated then we can't wait forever."
4676,Why are more and more countries letting US citizens in (even when they have lower cases than the US) but the US isn't letting people in?
4677,Doesn't really seem fair.
4678,I got vaccinated so I didn’t have to be cautious.
4679,"Those with two doses will be just fine, particularly if vaccination rates around them are high, no need to have caution at all."
4680,Mostly but not enough data yet kinda like how we don't know how long they will last.
4681,Most likely yes but at the same time we see enough evidence that people do.
4682,To be cautious that being said if you are vaccinated with the good vaccines you wont have anything past mild.
4683,If I lived in Russia I would be hesitant to take anything the government put out too.
4684,&gt;Ignore their fear mongering and live your life.
4685,And that's why we'll be struggling with COVID much longer than we needed to...
4686,Surgical masks prevent spread.
4687,N95 protect user.
4688,"Unless the mask is getting a seal around your face, it is not protecting you."
4689,[removed]
4690,"So, viruses mutate...there will be another and another and another variant until forever."
4691,My family and I have followed all the rules but eventually we have to move on.
4692,"We are vaccinated and will continue to wear masks in public, but that's it from now on."
4693,Micromanaging the public is not going to work at this point.
4694,Folks are too mentally exhausted.
4695,COVID’s peak death wave was between November and February/March.
4696,"Confused where you get “no abundance of death”, unless you’re intentionally ignoring facts."
4697,I do not share your optimism.
4698,A lot of folks are just contrarians.
4699,There are flat earther flight attendants.
4700,The US will be running low to medium numbers for a while.
4701,The weekly new infection numbers in FL just edged up a little.
4702,Other states like Missouri have definitely hit bottom and turned up.
4703,"I don't think the rates will get as high as they did before, but there are enough people out there who never got sick and aren't vaccinated who have zero resistance and they will keep this going for quite some time."
4704,"Nearly all (99%) the people sick and dying now are unvaccinated, so far."
4705,It be nice to see OSHA get involved lol.
4706,"The problem, as we’re going to see, is there’s going to be a tough fight for governments mandating a drug with an EUA"
4707,Exactly.
4708,The WHO isn't making this up for shits and giggles.
4709,They're looking at the data and analyzing it.
4710,I'm fairly certain the people that work for the WHO don't appreciate the findings either.
4711,Looking at the reactions to this news makes me wonder how people would handle a bad medical diagnosis.
4712,Denial doesn't help solve the problem.
4713,You hope people would deal with the problem head-on and do whatever they can to survive.
4714,"Yes, it’s a fear mongering article, frankly."
4715,But keep on cowering in fear.
4716,The fact that some of you don’t want to go back to normal even after vaccines is crazy to me.
4717,Only 26 people are hospitalized with covid in Israel.
4718,That's a negligible amount.
4719,My God!
4720,Just report that the Government is tracking us using Facial Recognition and only way to trick them is to wear a mask.
4721,California OSHA was going to still have stricter workplace requirements but then got shouted down and had to match the federal rules when CA reopened on the 15th.
4722,Federal OSHA just delayed and delayed releasing workplace mask rules until it became moot.
4723,I hope you will consider therapy when you are older.
4724,A comment on your parents if you are still there.
4725,They did so much damage.
4726,[deleted]
4727,"It's not an ""issue""."
4728,It's what makes America great.
4729,Maybe the problem is  that all along the focus was hand washing and not on good ventilation?
4730,Narcissistic parenting damages kids.
4731,"I largely agree with your global sentiment, but since the crux of this conversation is about how we should individually behave given that reality the context of each country becomes highly relevant to make informed decisions."
4732,The US has plenty of vaccines and if you are an adult and don't have one at this point it's because you've chosen not to.
4733,So the risk calculus is very different than a place like Tanzania where access to the vaccine is a barrier to safe behaviour.

“Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has insisted the Olympics and Paralympics can be held safely, regardless of the infection situation in the country and without specifying how to achieve that goal."
4864,"His lack of explanation for why the Olympics have to take place has drawn public criticism.”

It is suspected that PM Suga believe the Olympics will give him a better chance at keeping his job."
4865,"Why he believes so when the public opinion is very negative about holding the games this year,  I don’t understand personally."
4866,But that’s how the experts think.
4867,"For example, [Foreign Policy has an article titled “Suga’s Olympics-Sized Gamble.”](https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/06/22/tokyo-summer-olympics-suga-covid-19-pandemic/)

Any voice casting doubt about whether the games should really go ahead, is bad for Suga and the like-minded."

4937,The conservatives didn't care.
4938,Trump could have gotten his shot on live TV and the Q-anons would have found ways to deny that was what actually happened.
4939,Dunno where he/she is from but in Germany you wouldn't if you had contracted the virus.
4940,There is no point really as you will already have build anti bodies.
4941,"They should wear a jacket with orange letters saying ""variant"""
4942,"&gt;Moderna will now fill this gap and Germany will be able to stay at 5million shots per week

I doubt it, as more and more vaccination sites report that their supply outpaces local demand."
4943,This will make it difficult to keep the current rate of vaccination.
4944,We've both worn a mask before it was an official necessity in grocery stores and even if this will end at some point will continue to do so at least in flu season.
4945,Haven't had any cold for the longest time of my life.

4960,Don't even bother on Reddit.
4961,People here are so biased you'll be downvoted into oblivion.
4962,Sad really.
4963,"I get that the Republican party made the stupid move of endorsing non mask wearing, but there are plenty of people in the middle and on the left that have been hesitant to get the vaccine."
4964,"And to be fair, after the last year I don't blame some people for losing faith in the honesty and integrity of the scientific communities inability to keep medicine scientific."
4965,"The impact of side effects and not trusting the government to be honest about risks is the main issue I've heard people in my circles complain about, mixed  with freedom of choice, and not believing the risk of a vaccine outdated the rewards."
4966,Lucky for me nobody I know is crazy enough to outright deny covid exists or thinks any of the 5g mumbo jumbo.
4967,Quite ironic
4968,"But if the 'breakthrough' is mild symptoms, then the vaccine is still working at a good level"
4969,"It’s a manageable thing so far, but it can be a bad thing."
4970,"First because not everyone is or can be vaccinated, and it increases the odds of aggressive variants running free."
4971,"But more importantly, having many vaccinated people catching it at scale increases the chances for resistant mutations."
4972,I would go a step further and stop vaccinating teens and younger and put those vaccines to use in covax.
4973,He uh...
4974,"Probably isn't looking for women, at least not exclusively."
4975,Is there an argument to delay vaccination of teens and younger to focus on vulnerable around the world?

4985,Yikes...here we go again.
4986,Active cases.
4987,The rate of increase is about 55% per week.
4988,Hospitalisations and deaths also increasing.
4989,But the % of cases resulting in hospital or death is significantly reduced compared to previous waves.
4990,Welp... LET'S DO THE TIME WARP AGAIN!
4991,"&gt;Today, most cases in Russia are caused by Delta variant so CoviVac will if fact be tested against it, while Sputnik was tested against earlier variants

Yeah, but there's nothing that can be done about it."
4992,"Besides, since Sputnik is widely used the data on its effectiveness against the new strain can be gathered rather quickly (although, I think, it's rather complicated because you need to sequence viral samples of the patients to determine which strain they're infected with if you want to see how it works against a particular strain)."
4993,"It's not equivalent to the data coming from phase 3 trials, but still some comparison can be made."
4994,The side effect of having strictly age based vaccination bands is that even when a high percentage of the population is vaccinated it still creates environments with basically no immunity.
4995,People in their 20s are still at best partially vaccinated in the UK.
4996,Thank for you all of the positive posts for all of these past months.
4997,They've been very inspiring!
4998,"I wonder, do you think the Delta (and Delta+) variants will become a big problem here in Florida for those who are already fully vaccinated?"
4999,Behind a paywall
5000,That's not even hippy.
5001,That's mainstream bullshit.
5002,Depends on context.
5003,"If you're over 60 in a corona pandemic, you should get it anyway."
5004,"If it was a measles vaccine for children, for example, 2 deaths in 2.5 million would mean the vaccine would be withdrawn."
5005,This stat isn't telling you what you think it is.
5006,It's telling you that elderly and vulnerable people's risk profile is now similar to that of young healthy people.
5007,That's a huge win and means no more lockdowns will be needed.
5008,None of you guys even asked any questions.
5009,You just started pointing fingers.
5010,"There's a whole laundry list, some much crazier than others"
5011,All that tells us is the elderly and vulnerable now have a similar risk profile to young people.
5012,"Which is great news, vaccines are working."
5013,To understand that stat you need to see it broken down by age and compared to previous waves.
5014,The difference is stark.
5015,[removed]
5016,I happened across [this helpful site ](https://www.vaxteen.org/) which helps teens identify relevant local laws regarding getting themselves vaccinated
5017,"I’m no expert, have there been vaccines that had side effects or medical complications after the first year?"
5018,I never heard of any but in my lifetime the only other new vaccines were chicken pox and HPV...and I got both before vaccination was an option.
5019,If cases double then deaths will double.
5020,That will always be the case no matter how many people you vaccinate.
5021,The question is what % of cases result in hospitalisation.
5022,As long as that is low enough to stop health care being overwhelmed then there will be no lockdown.
5023,Evidence in so far is hospitalisations are massively down compared to previous waves.
5024,Way to perpetuate generational stereotypes.
5025,"It is significant to cause a positive test result, but it still doesn't seem to evade immune response enough to cause severe disease."
5026,This isn't a bad thing.
5027,Those crazy kids!
5028,Trying to protect themselves from permanent lung scarring...
5029,"Baby Boomers, those born between 1945 and 1955, have a higher vaccination rate than those born after.plus the parents of these teenagers are most likely Gen X."
5030,So your comment is senseless.
5031,"This is Reddit, nobody who has secs goes on reddit 3 months is nothing."
5032,"In all seriousness, I don't believe there's any burden of proof to that."
5033,"So all a gay guy has to do is say he hasn't had sex, and he's good to donate."
5034,"Since the advantage of mRNA vaccine tech is that they can be developed and produced relatively quickly, why wouldn't I just wait for an ""upgrade"" to the vaccine that actually accounts for the Delta class of virii...and, until then, act like I wasn't vaccinated at all (use masks, social distance, etc."
5035,).
5036,Paying for a fake certificate instead being inoculated for free.
5037,Strong galaxy brain vibes here.
5038,a heart attack is a possible symptom of (severe) heart inflammation.
5039,I and probably most others commenting here wore masks diligently for over a year.
5040,I purchased 3M N95 masks and N99 masks to use whenever I entered a hospital or airport or any other high risk place.
5041,But at this point I’m vaccinated and relatively young and healthy.
5042,Im sick of wearing masks and with the numbers plummeted to where they are I feel completely safe not wearing it.
5043,I may get a bit sick if I’m exposed but that’s a risk I’m willing to take.
5044,This is never going 100% away and I’m not going to wear a mask forever.
5045,I don’t think it’s selfish to want to go back to relative normalcy after taking all the necessary precautions throughout the pandemic.
5046,"Right, well in that case, we don't know how far back cases might have started in 1919, maybe months sooner, not sure if that is known, but I checked and wiki officially says...26 months actually...not 18...(and another poster said 3 years...maybe that is included original/random cases before widespread.)"
5047,Point is...original dates listed as 26 months from Feb 1918- to about 2 years later  April 1920.   with the bulk probably ending a few months before that.
5048,So...March 2020...to like May 2022 would put us in about the same spot.
5049,"Also maybe back then they had so many people get sick in the major wave, that they didn't have as many in a later wave, as we instead had people isolating and access to masks, sanitzier could get things delivered home etc."
5050,so we may have a bigger chunk still uninvected...vs then...so ...its gonna take time for those people to either get vaxxed or get infected.
5051,"That is why...between the actual time putting us at MAy 2022 if you take the same date range, and...we still have a lot of people unvaxxed/no immunity from social distancing...means....its likely gonna be some months more and a surge in the fall/winter esp in un-vaxxed communities."
5052,"(And even vaxxed people will be getting it as it mutates and delta becomes dominant so....masking will be essential like...right now actually, and capacity rectrictions in fall/winter, but probably not full lock-downs unless it mutates even worse.)"
5053,We don't have much hope again.
5054,The main cause to this shitshow is how much people doesnt believe in covid/ doesnt wanna follow health protocol.
5055,Many stupid people here.
5056,Though I agree that the government needs to be more disciplined in their rules and how they enforce them.

5092,"My mom is freaking out about her going, seems to me like she should cancel, what's your opinion?"
5093,What are the risks?
5094,My understanding is that if you're fully vaxxed you're relatively safe however the medical system may be overwhelmed with COVID patients and if one has a medical need other than COVID it may be difficult to get care.
5095,Not sure if there are any other risks.
5096,Why are we hearing this mostly from WHO and not the CDC and Fauci?

5103,Good point about deadliness.

5130,"Maybe, but we also have a lot of unvaccinated, so......

(1/3 of population is like 100 million people or more here...unvaxxed.....)"
5131,I imagine it will probably be similar to hospitalizations/deaths - the risk is dramatically reduced but not completely eliminated.
5132,A huge majority of boomers are fully vaccinated.
5133,"Even this is good, the bad thing is that it seems that the virus will continue to circulate even with everyone vaccinated and it will probably require us to vaccinate ourselfs for a really long time until it gets to some lesser mutation."
5134,September deliveries are admittedly too late for the EU since most first doses will have been administered by mid-July in adults.
5135,"However, they will be useful for use in adolescents."
5136,"I mean yeah that's true but it's absolutely not how people see vaccines, and given that there are several alternatives with *no* deaths per million, any health authority would ditch AZ in favor of those if there weren't such an urgent need to get the population, especially the over-60s, vaccinated."

5171,"I deducted from this part of the article: 


“It is ubiquitous and found in soil and air..” 



I’m sure Indians aren’t pushing their faces into dirt, or all cases being from home/factory growers working with soil."

I haven’t heard or read anything related to this."
5173,"Mild cases wouldn’t be hospitalized, would they?"
5174,&gt;	and there are few effective treatments known.
5175,"Well yes, it has been this way for 18 months now."
5176,Some meds helped while others don’t.
5177,I’m pretty sure doctors worldwide are reassessing that specific treatment.
5178,"&gt;	The problem is that steroids given in that case don’t help much and can be harmful (hurt the body’s efforts to fight off Covid, as well as make it vulnerable to other pathogens like fungi)."
5179,"This is what I said, and what the article said as well."
5180,"&gt;	Steroids should be given in a limited dose, for a limited time, only to Covid patients who are hypoxic."

5182,What exactly are you adding after your first sentence haha
5183,"Also, AZ is not recommended for younger people, which is the current target in vaccination campaigns in Europe."

5190,"All of you advocating mask wearing after covid need your heads checked, but I’m guessing most of these accounts are just bots anyway, I take care of my body, rarely get sick, didn’t get covid and I’m fully vaccinated, we have a obesity and mental health crisis in this country, masks will not solve that problem."
5191,[removed]
5192,Dude i never said it falls short.
5193,It falls short compared to Pfizer and Moderna.
5194,It is a bit less effective than Pfizer and Moderna in reducing symptomatic infection.
5195,(70% compared to 90% roughly).

5222,I have done my research and I have lived thru P1 making a mockery of everything we had achieved in the year prior.
5223,Added to which just yesterday our country’s chief medical officer - speaking on the different variants - stated that the Delta variant is indeed more transmissible but also results in more serious cases showing up to hospital and as a follow on - more deaths.
5224,We are talking in this thread about unvaccinated children.
5225,The US has not yet really been hit by any of the recent variants and so their thinking is very different from those who have seen the effects first-hand.
5226,Particularly in an unvaccinated population.
5227,There are people in this thread saying when those over 50 are vaccinated everything should go back to the way it was before.
5228,These people have not experienced in their 30s and 40s with no comorbidities suddenly getting gravely ill and dying in large numbers.
5229,"No, AZ does not fall short."
5230,Stop spreading disinformation.
5231,Nobody knows it for sure because russian government banned all real vaccines there.

5253,"We don’t know yet if you can still transmit it when infected with the delta variant, unless you have proof of it that I haven’t seen."
5254,I think it’s unlikely but it’s a very serious unknown with big implications.
5255,No...afaik.
5256,"Fauci said this is the most contagious virus he has ever seen in his career, with the exception of 1 other."
5257,(not a corona but he mentioned some other well-known virus it was on par with as the most...contagious he has ever seen in his life.
5258,"Also not sure what you mean by deadly...in terms of risk per patient, or overall...but given how contagious it is it ends up killing more as it infects more, so...its killed the most by far too...if actual risk per patient in 1 case vs 1 case, not sure, but perhaps that too.)"
5259,"That doesn’t make sense, there must be some hidden factor influencing the results."
5260,"Off the top of my head it could be that the UK started vaccinating the elderly first, and the elderly have a naturally higher mortality rate when infected with the virus."
5261,So the data is skewed towards higher mortality for the vaccinated (elderly) population.
5262,Would be worth it to look deeper into the patient data.
5263,"If you know a publicly available source of the raw data (age, vaccination date, variant, etc) I can do some data analytics on it."
5264,"The pandemic will never be over because every country has anti vaxxers

It’s unreasonable to expect the responsible majority to continue to live a life of restraint to support those selfish assholes."
5265,Let them get Covid.
5266,I don’t care
5267,Where are you?
5268,Because where I am states have dropped all masks requirements for the vaccinated.
5269,I think Boomers debunked that shit ages ago.
5270,[removed]
5271,And?
5272,Right now in the USA every single person that is two dosed and walking inside places without masks on has probably gotten sick with the virus... Every single one.
5273,You know why?
5274,Cause we don't magically have a barrier around us cause we got a vaccine.
5275,We will still have the virus in our system but our antibodies will fight them off and we will never know we have the virus cause it's asymptomatic.
5276,If you test every single fully vaccinated person that goes to the gym without a mask on I'm guessing 90% will come back with having the virus...
5277,But the point is they don't spread it and it's asymptomatic... Getting sick isn't the problem it's the severe cases that's the problem.
5278,You're not gonna have a severe case unless you don't have the vaccine or are immunocompromised.
5279,So what’s the consensus now with the delta variant?
5280,My wife and I are fully vaccinated so we haven’t been wearing masks as that’s what the CDC has said is fine.
5281,"But with the delta variant, I’m reading the WHO is saying we should be wearing one?"
5282,What’s everyone’s thoughts about mask wearing for the delta variant when you’re fully vaccinated?
5283,"Probably negative, but exposed due to most buses having at least one person who was infected."
5284,"Hence, fuck those people."
5285,"Lol -6, no discussion allowed, beatings will continue until everyone ignores reality and gets the vaccine no matter what their personal risk factors are!"
5286,"""Do your research"" - the new war cry of stupid Qpeople."
5287,So your position is that healthy children with previous COVID infections are at risk for re-infection and complications?
5288,Please share the studies you are referencing.
5289,Yeah that would help.
5290,Yep.
5291,And my husband's boomer parents are about as progressive as you can get and have been going door to door signing up people to get their vaccine and also volunteering at the vaccination clinic weekly
5292,“Follow the science” has turned into “ignore the science and only listen to very broad general guidelines from the CDC meant to cater to the lowest common denominator”.
5293,"I get why the CDC has taken the position that everyone no matter what must get vaccinated (plenty of “I swear I had COVID in February 2020 before there were tests!”, people)."
5294,"But for someone to call me crazy for following the advice of my son’s pediatrician which seems to be based in reality, is fucking crazy."
5295,"You just simply forgot to mention that those people who haven't been vaccinated yet are either chose not to ( that is their personal responsibility) or very young teenagers, young adults who have very little chance to go into hospital (especially for longer time) or die."
5296,&gt;Among US
5297,"Because your not really an adult and allowed to make these kinda choices 

Even when you are 18 and it’s your choice your parents still have somewhat authority over you if you want to live under there roof, yes it’s bull they have that much power but if it’s the choice between having the jab and having to live on the street because your parents are completely insane we both know which many will choose"

5331,There is no way a single Governor there reimplements a mask mandate with effective vaccines available.

5449,Doctors have been wearing masks for 10+ hour shifts daily before the pandemic and it absolutely isn't an issue unless your mask is garbage or you're lazy.

Continuing to administer these vaccines could be considered irresponsible given the availability of other vaccines without those risks."
5474,"There’s historical precedent for relatively rare conditions leading to a vaccination halt:

“In 1976, concerns in the United States about a possible influenza pandemic involving a virus similar to the deadly 1918 pandemic strain resulted in a large-scale vaccination program for the entire country."
5475,Approximately 45 million people were vaccinated in 10 weeks with what became known as the “swine flu vaccine” [16].
5476,The US government abruptly stopped the vaccination program when no swine flu cases were detected outside the military base where the disease originated and when an unexpectedly high number of cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome were reported in vaccinated individuals.
5477,"The vaccine was estimated to have caused approximately one Guillain-Barré syndrome case per 100,000 persons vaccinated [17], resulting in 53 deaths [18].”

“Guillain-Barre (gee-YAH-buh-RAY) syndrome is a rare disorder in which your body's immune system attacks your nerves."

5483,"Eventually, you just have to let people take control of their own lives and decide what risks are worth taking."
5484,[removed]
5485,Australia has less than 5% of the population that is fully vaccinated.
5486,Probably should try to get those numbers up fast.
5487,"""Delta Plus"" adds a mutation that Beta (S.Africa) has which helps it to evade neutralization by vaccine or previous COVID infection."
5488,"That said, it doesn't appear to spread efficiently - much like Beta doesn't (only 2% or so of cases in the US are Beta)."
5489,"There was also an ""Alpha Plus"", which added K417N mutation to the previously most contagious variant (Alpha-UK B.1.1.7), and that didn't take hold anywhere either."
5490,"This is a Great report on why ""Delta Plus"" isn't likely to be an issue: https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-comment-on-the-delta-plus-variant-b-1-617-2-with-the-addition-of-k417n-mutation/  
  
Ultimately, we won't know until more time and research is done, but it hasn't proven to be an extreme threat as of yet."
5491,"I'm 100% Pro-Vaccination, btw, Get vaccinated!"
5492,"But I just don't consider ""Delta Plus"" a gamechanger (thankfully)."
5493,I've played enough Plague Inc. to know that Covid was causing too much illness and that we would jump on a vaccine so fast..
5494,"I know that they haven't been great, I'm hoping for improvements."
5495,[removed]
5496,"Even if 50% vaccinated, that's not true because the vaccinated and unvaccinated populations are not randomly selected so they would behave differently (e.g."
5497,"scientifically minded vs science deniers, older vs younger, healthy vs immunocompromised)."
5498,"And EVEN if they are randomly selected, just knowing that you've been vaccinated can cause you to behave differently."
5499,That's why the setup needs to be a double-blind experiment where the two groups are randomly selected with neither the participants nor the experiment conductors knowing what shots were administered.

5748,"&gt; In Kolkata, the police said, at least 250 disabled and transgender people were injected with fake vaccine doses at one site."
5749,Holy shit
5750,This is one of the most frustrating things right now.
5751,You can't make long-term plans for certain things because you don't know if the pandemic will turn for the worse again.
5752,[removed]
5753,"And that’s fine, but you should remember that science has said that the overwhelmingly likely outcome is that they will be completely fine."
5754,Vaccination rate there?
5755,[deleted]
5756,There is no way at the moment you could probably get almost any governor in this country except maybe Hawaii to reinstate a mask mandate - which Hawaii still has.
5757,"Cases are so low, hospitalizations have declined and you can almost guarantee there would be a pushback to reinstating any restrictions

Around March or April there was a lot of talk that cases might surge because of a variant circulating at that time - I believe from Brazil and South Africa."
5758,"Yes, cases went up for awhile but they eventually came back down."
5759,"Considering rural areas are where mainly people haven’t been vaccinated, it shouldn’t spread as much among them

The problem with what you guys are saying about bringing back mask mandates is that is not at all fair to those who have been vaccinated."
5760,"More than that, we can’t just base everything now on cases - we have to base it on hospitalizations and deaths"
5761,There’s no way you can say it wasn’t.
5762,"Except - the more evidence that comes out, the more it looks engineered."
5763,Not the other way around.
5764,It’s manufactured
5765,Yes I read the same.
5766,Some people have autoimmune disorders that mean it's unwise to get vaccinated.
5767,Is az the worst out of all vaccines?
5768,I would prefer the actual relevant locations to be allowed in the title.
5769,"Or at least country specific tags, which are already present for USA and Canada instead of them being 'North America'."
5770,"Labelling something as 'Europe' is pointlessly vague, Most of the Russian population is on the European continent, does the title apply to them?"
5771,When you start hitting 60-70% between those that naturally got it and those vaccinated there aren’t enough people for wide scale community spreading unless there are unvaccinated pockets
5772,Should we be using the reddit.com/report and that Zendesk email instead of the sub-provided report button in those cases?

5777,EMTALA violations for everyone
5778,They're trying to tell us since they're both mrna vaccines they can be easily interchanged and the effectiveness is the same or higher since they target slightly different parts of the spike protein
5779,We are going to reach herd immunity one way or another…..
5780,Kudos to those parents!
5781,Way to make a teenager do what we want them to do...
5782,I'd also say that the data from UK and Israel is not very surprising.
5783,"Theoretical calculations suggest that neither country has reached herd immunity yet, although the UK is at least doing extremely good progress in getting everyone vaccinated."
5784,I'm not socializing with people that aren't vaccinated.
5785,I had a date last night.
5786,She said she wasn't going to get the vaccine (she works at a pediatric dentist - unbelievable).
5787,"Asked her why,  she gave some bullshit answer like she doesn't like the government telling her what to do, I told her she's open to her opinion but I don't socialize with people who aren't vaccinated."
5788,End of date.
5789,Went for a hike!
5790,The hike was better!
5791,:-P
5792,You can't transmit any of them when fully vaccinated so why would this be different?
5793,[deleted]
5794,It'll be significantly faster than the first vaccines.
5795,"&gt;  vaccines are 100% efficient at preventing death, 

That statement comes from various trials (of up to tens of thousands of people each) where nobody who was vaccinated died of COVID-19."
5796,"(In some of the trials on younger cohorts, nobody vaccinated developed serious COVID or was hospitalized)."
5797,"It's IMHO an irresponsibly optimistic thing to strip a ""100% effective"" from this context since it's obviously not going to remain perfect when extended to a much larger population in the tens or hundreds of millions."
5798,"In children and in adults, I’ve seen studies show &gt;40% suffer long covid."
5799,That’s asymptomatic and symptomatic infections.
5800,"My state breaks down sequencing, and at least here, Alpha seems to have out-competed Beta."
5801,"Alpha also seems to have out-competed Gamma/P1/Brazilian strain, and the other VOCs/VOIs."
5802,Delta looks to be out-competing Alpha.
5803,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/mp7ss7/covid_india_overtakes_brazil_as_worlds_second/gu8pq48/?context=3

Not like it wasn't predictable..."
5804,"I don't know why this is a ""political remark."""
5805,It's a public health concern.
5806,I hope so but the data from UK and Israel is not super promising.
5807,Both more vaccinated than the US.
5808,Israel just reinstated their mask mandate.
5809,They're having Delta breakouts in schools with kids 12 and under unvaccinated and cases growing exponentially.
5810,On top of that this particular article is about Delta Plus which is supposedly even worse for the vaccinated than Delta but we'll have more data soon.
5811,It's not a generation thing.
5812,It's an intelligence thing.
5813,"I’ve not seen any studies yet, I’m guessing the attention is still on treatment and containment"
5814,It's not just kids getting it.
5815,It's kids transmitting it to others
5816,But you won’t die!
5817,We are in an ever-changing pandemic.
5818,You need to manage your expectations.
5819,Doctors and scientists can’t predict the future.
5820,"While cases rising and deaths staying low thanks to vaccination is a likely scenario, this is not showing yet in Israel."
5821,I think we are at least 3 weeks away from data possibly showing that to be true in Israel.
5822,The explosion in cases started about 8 days ago (and from a very low starting point).
5823,"It's not just that the lag between deaths and cases is always larger than that, it's the fact that even with the increase, cases are still 1/50th of what they were in the winter peak."
5824,"Assuming equal ratio between cases and deaths, based on today's cases, they shouldn't be having more than one daily average death."
5825,[removed]
5826,The same sore arm is only side effect I've ever had.
5827,"TLDR vaccines are working, the more people that get vaccinated, the higher proportion of cases are breakthrough cases 

&gt;Consider the hypothetical world where absolutely everyone had received a less than perfect vaccine."
5828,"Although the death rate would be low, everyone who died would have been fully vaccinated."
5829,Yeah I would say just watch what the CDC says.
5830,"Also, pay attention to your state and local health departments because depending on where you are located in the USA vaccination rates can differ pretty wildly."
5831,"What I suspect is likely to happen (and Fauci has commented on this as well) is that under-vaccinated regions of the USA will see some increases from Delta and other variants, whereas regions with high uptake with likely see very-little to no increases in hospitalizations/deaths."
5832,[removed]
5833,Took me a week or so for smell and taste to come back.
5834,For a month or two things were still muted a bit but everything is back to normal now.
5835,This was back in January this year.
5836,This isn’t really the point.
5837,Boomers are a highly vaccinated age group in every country.
5838,"I agree we need straight talk, we need adults in charge of this thing, and we need to be more proactive."
5839,Fully reopening and taking away the mask mandate while having our most populated state governors celebrating the end of Covid literally just as the Delta variant is beginning to spread is the opposite of being proactive.
5840,Older people do that.
5841,But young families want to spend time around the pool in guaranteed sun.
5842,&gt;	with around half of those in unvaccinated children.
5843,This is key.
5844,"If children can be vaccinated by late summer, we will have a much better degree of control."
5845,Hopefully Pfizer and Moderna will roll out their updated vaccines in time for the kids.
5846,"Good, you shouldn't listen to the most ignorant anti-intellectual people that exist."
5847,"They may be the loudest, but that's because they aren't smart"
5848,Fauci can no longer be trusted.
5849,Find another.
5850,This stupid ott rhetoric doesn't help convince anyone.
5851,I'm sure you are well aware that chances of death from covid in that age group are negligible.
5852,My child wore a mask for years before Covid because they had asthma and allergies.
5853,The mask provided some relief for those conditions.
5854,I think people might continue to wear them as necessary for their own comfort.
5855,I know I'll wear one at least during cold and flu season.
5856,It was nice not having a cold all last year.
5857,"No one talks about this fact, it's pretty annoying to see so many articles about how antibody levels drop dramatically after a few months and that's why everyone needs booster shots soon."
5858,Either extremely ignorant journalism or straight up fear mongering
5859,Well we have to be careful of new strains developing though.
5860,We dont want constant new outbreaks.
5861,It’s just depressing.
5862,We need straight talk.
5863,This up and down shit is what’s getting to me.
5864,I can handle the masks and I can play it safe for longer.
5865,But I don’t want promises made prematurely.
5866,I’m just over 40 and I feel like I’m stuck between generations.
5867,The Xs think I’m a millenial and the millennials think I’m a genX.
5868,I feel like I have parts of both.
5869,I think the uptake here is that generation definitions are pretty bad at actually classifying people
5870,That makes sense I just hadn't heard that it wasn't doing well
5871,Not sure why they chose the Daily Mail for their opinion piece.
5872,"Anyway, the long and short of their argument is: 

&gt; ""because a change in the spike protein – which allows the coronavirus to enter and infect human cells – that is radical enough to make our vaccine completely ineffective would also, almost certainly, be so extreme as to make the virus non-functional."""
5873,Sorry if opinion pieces are not allowed here.
5874,Seems premature to me.
5875,I would like to see case rates staying low around the world for at least a few months before I conclude this is over and resume normal-ish activities.

5883,I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s doing well but it’s hard to say since it’s not deployed as widely as AZ Pfizer of Moderna
5884,Paywall: I found an article on the same topic.
5885,It looks as though the vaccine protects against severe illness from the delta variant but there is concern that vaccinated people can spread it to unvaccinated.

5887,He told her to blew him away.
5888,“Jones”?
5889,"Only boomers write messages like this, post checks out."
5890,"nope, and not really an issue as my interest is kinda already gone from it"
5891,"If it's not going to End, how will it become Endemic?"
5892,Checkmate.
5893,😎
5894,Picture a diagram with a single person at the top.
5895,This person has covid.
5896,Below that person are three branches leading to three other people that person spreads covid to.
5897,Below those three people are three more branches each that they all spread covid to.
5898,"And below those nine people are another three each, and so on and so on."
5899,This is how covid spreads without vaccines.
5900,Each person infecting 3 more until this tree includes everybody in a population.
5901,Picturing this tree.
5902,It's massive.
5903,It goes a long way down and branches out very far and wide.
5904,"Now, imagine that half of those people are vaccinated and don't catch or spread it."
5905,Imagine the vaccinated people are randomly distributed through this tree.
5906,Every person below the vaccinated ones in this tree don't catch it because the person who would have given it to them didn't get it.
5907,"If someone who happens to be near the top of that tree gets vaccinated, they could end up sparing literally thousands of people far down that tree from getting it too."
5908,This is also why even vaccinating just half of a population reduces infections by more than half.
5909,"Because you're not just reducing a person's chance of infection, if that person doesn't get infected, then the people they would have spread it to also don't get infected, and the people they would have spread it to don't get infected, and so on."
5910,"That's why we're in a much better spot that it might initially seem, even though vaccinations aren't as good as they could be."
5911,"And of course, spread doesn't occur as simply as I've described it, people don't have just one opportunity to catch covid, and vaccinated people aren't evenly distributed throughout the US population, but the principle is still there."
5912,"And even though it may be a little counter intuitive, the numbers already show this."
5913,"My state has less than 50% with even a single dose, but our daily infection rates are about a third of one percent of what they were back in January when almost no one was vaccinated."
5914,This whole sub loves the idea of being fully vaccinated and removing your mask and avoid restrictions as if you can't catch the virus.
5915,"it's not 

I don't live anywhere near california and rarely open these kinda articles unless one on here spikes my interest"
5916,This dude gets it.
5917,We never lived in a world without antibiotics.
5918,Have you been tracking vaccine efficacy?
5919,"All vaccines are at least 2x less effective against delta variant infections, hospitalizations."
5920,"""No sign""... Yeah, if you don't look."
5921,There is also some difference depending on which vaccine you use.
5922,"mRNA vaccines are more effective, especially at stopping spread, than some of the other vaccines out there"
5923,Weeding out people as nature does
5924,“Slightly ill” is the lucky poker hand.
5925,"A large number of people draw the bad poker hands, which vary from “respiratory failure” to “scarring of the lungs” to “death”."
5926,I think I heard it on the BBC.
5927,Can't find it back right now but I'll keep looking.

5958,Congrats on being lucky.
5959,I know people who've died.
5960,My father in law lost 7 friends in the span of 6 weeks.
5961,"I haven't had it, no one in my family has had it, and I'd rather not take any chances."
5962,"I have kids to look out for so even if all I do is get super sick for a couple weeks, I have to worry about getting them taken care of while not getting them sick as well, or worse worry about them suffering long term health complications due to scarred lungs or blood clots."
5963,My wife and I are vaccinated and as soon as the kids are old enough they will be too.
5964,It's so fucking easy to not gamble and have to hope we're all in the lucky group.

5966,Transmission breeds mutation.
5967,We need to be careful even if vaccines are decent against hospitalizations.
5968,"As long as transmission chain is not broken, we are all at risk, vaccinated or not."
5969,I don't think it's that much to ask of vaccinated people to have some degree of cautious at this time.
5970,"Caught a cold from my son, it's doing some sinus infection mess now, but it is almost done with."
5971,"Besides the blatant obvious point of not getting sick long-term or dying, many people are getting vaccinated to protect others."
5972,"We’re getting it for our friends and relatives who can’t get the vaccine because they aren’t eligible or who got it and didn’t happen to get an immune response because they’re on immunosuppressive drugs, or are immunocompromised from chemotherapy treatment."
5973,"But we didn’t get the vaccine to help protect you, because you’re obviously immortal."
5974,Good luck with that.
5975,"*the following is a joke*

It’s a shame the virus isn’t more deadly."
5976,The problem would solve itself as the population who self-selected not to have a vaccine would slowly stop existing.
5977,Yw.
5978,":)

And by the time we have to worry about strains, there should be new vaccines for those ready to distribute right away right?"
5979,"Additionally, this is the representative to Russia."
5980,"The Russian vaccines, as well as many of the Chinese vaccines, have been proven to be less effective at preventing symptoms and hospitalization than some of the Western vaccine counterparts."
5981,"Compounded with the low extremely low vaccination rates in Russia, this does not surprise me."
5982,No need to be hateful about it.
5983,It just entrenches people more and takes away any chance of changing someone's mind.
5984,I don’t know.
5985,"I got the shot and would gladly do it again (COVID sucked), but it’s nuts that some people have such bad side effects"
5986,The ones you make will likely have minimal protection for you for these variants.
5987,Surgical masks are very cheap now and widely available and protect the wearer way more then cloth masks.
5988,My parents are boomers and they are fully vaccinated now.
5989,My brother and I are millennials and we both got out first shot.
5990,I think people need to start looking at Gen X more.
5991,They are so easily overlooked.
5992,I’m not implying anything.
5993,"I’m saying that if somebody already has immunity from natural infection, should they be forced to get the vaccine."
5994,"I posed it as a question, not as a personal opinion."
5995,The seven day rolling average in New York is 307 cases.
5996,Please stop.
5997,It’s over.
5998,Don’t forget Gen X (born between 1965 - 1980) exists too.
5999,Don’t always go solely after the boomers.
6000,Are you trying to imply that someone getting a vaccine would be worse than getting the virus?
6001,"You really think that in a hospital, tens to hundreds of workers have “personal risk factors” that would preclude them from getting a vaccine?"
6002,They work in hospitals after all!
6003,What a shite take
6004,It may not be particularly easy to get.
6005,There's a clinic near me that has some doses expiring soon so they're basically giving them to whoever wants one.
6006,"That is tragic, but the statistics are pretty clear - millions upon millions have been vaccinated, and severe side effects such as blood clotting have been extremely rare."
6007,[removed]
6008,"My takeaway from all of these articles is we need to focus globally on hospitalizations, deaths, and are hospitals overrun?"
6009,Cases can’t be the defining metric - not with how quickly the virus spreads.
6010,"With the vaccines, the link between cases and hospitalization has been cut."
6011,"Yes, you can still get sick and yes you can still be hospitalized but the chances of that happening are dramatically lower."
6012,We shouldn’t be making public policy decisions that effect millions of people on just cases which is what most people are talking about
6013,Definitely Millenial.
6014,We didn’t see the devastation that measles created and how the vaccine prevented it.
6015,Isn't Sputnik pretty good?
6016,Or is it falling hard to variants
6017,No comment then.
6018,When you realize Gen X’ers were born in the 1960’s.
6019,(͡•_ ͡• )
6020,Masks help immensely when it comes to keeping germs off our mouths and noses.
6021,"Mostly because we couldn't touch them, I think"
6022,"Actually, the 7 day average what I heard is down to 11,000 and something cases a day."
6023,"That’s pretty low for an entire country - especially compared to where we were

There will always be Covid cases."
6024,We need to focus on the big picture - overrun hospitals and the number of deaths
6025,Thank you.
6026,"Yes, so."
6027,I never stopped wearing a mask.
6028,"When the CDC first said back when Covid hit that we don’t need masks, I immediately started making them and wearing them."
6029,I didn’t believe them this time either.
6030,Local production is AZ with 12 weeks between doses.
6031,Started that in March/April.
6032,Vaccination didn't really ramp up with both Pfizer and AZ until May.
6033,About 30% of 16+ with at least one dose.
6034,Didn't Angela Merkel already do this?
6035,I hope you don’t ever have to go to a doctors office or on an airplane or visit with an immunocompromised friend/family member or visit someone in a hospital
6036,"No I get it, you’re right."

6043,a great article about this https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/coronavirus-excess-deaths-tracker
6044,&gt; Why is someone going to get a vaccine if nothing changes and they still have to wear a mask?
6045,"Where I live, ~70% are un-vacinated and pretty much that many (or more) are going maskless, so that argument fails in light of actual behavior."
6046,They're trying to have it both ways.
6047,Just read the TL;DR you made.
6048,Do you REALLY think the vaccins are killing THAT many people ?
6049,No cures perhaps.
6050,But death is a 100% effective therapy.
6051,"I don't think it's a stretch to say that an unvaccinated person can infect (probably asymptomatically) one vaccinated person and one unvaccinated person per case, and that cases could grow in such a scenario, even if vaccinated people are not very infectious."
6052,That's absolutely not true.
6053,The best example of how a massive covid outbreak would affect a vaccinated individual is hospital overload.
6054,"If there's a massive Delta spike in the south, all the ICU beds are full, you'll have vaccinated people dying from other causes because they couldn't get medical attention."

6113,Kids down to age 12 can already get vaccinated on Israel.
6114,Isn't that mostly because private gatherings are the easiest to contact trace in the first place?
6115,"You normally can't contact trace any fleeting contact in public, except the Australian health authorities did because they have so few cases and that case was caught on CCTV."

6120,"So seriously, stay unvaccinated and see how free you are you patriots."
6121,This exactly.
6122,Most of the time spent developing vaccines is not about getting all the safety data.
6123,There are no vaccines that had severe side effects show up more than a few months after the shot.
6124,You can rule out safety issues pretty quickly.
6125,Most of the time is waiting for enough test subjects to get infected and seeing how long immunity lasts.
6126,"For vaccinated people, yeah."
6127,"That doesn't change the fact that if Delta gets a foothold in the unvaccinated population, we're gonna see a lot of dead people, which I would say wouldn't ""be pretty."""

6135,It's possible it's just a fluke.
6136,Remember the whole airborne/aerosol thing?
6137,One case cited as evidence of that was covid spreading from one hotel room to another when a door was slightly open.
6138,And this was presumably OG covid.
6139,"So it DID apparently happen but if it were regularly THAT transmissible, well the entire world would've gotten herd immunity the hard way."

6165,"You don't have to believe in it, it exists, and it's a problem for unvaccinated people."
6166,Unvaccinated people *should be scared.
6167,*
6168,"A vaccine will never truly be 100% effective, but it can be pretty darn close

*If* the 45% figure is correct (I would like to see the source), one reasonable explanation could be that the deaths that still happen are among the very oldest and frailest among the population."
6169,"In that age group very few have *not* been vaccinated, especially in the UK were hesitancy is low and supply is high."
6170,Relatively many vaccinated die because there are very few that are unvaccinated.
6171,That does not contradict the vaccine having very high efficacy against deaths.
6172,"Without vaccines, the current daily deaths could very well be 10x or even 100x the current amount."

6178,You literally just said the same thing as me but with more detail.
6179,So what are we debating?
6180,"😆

I originally commented because someone claimed (and later deleted) that this article was created just to spread fear, which I disagree with."
6181,Anyways this will probably be my last comment.
6182,"Basically, I think this article has value because it gives us the facts so that we can individually respond however we see fit."
6183,"The ""x% of infected/hospitalized/dead were vaccinated"" stat really has drastically different implications depending on how many people are vaccinated and for how long."
6184,"The US media and CDC have been having a field day crowing about this number for months and making it as rosy as possible by being misleading, namely by not even looking for infections among the vaccinated that don't lead to hospitalization and by setting the timeframe all the way back to late 2020 in some cases, when almost no one was vaccinated."
6185,Almost no one minded these bad stats in favor of the vaccine though.
6186,We're going to have to wean people off it as this number inevitably climbs in the US simply as more people are vaccinated and for longer.
6187,Efficacy is the metric people can (sometimes) understand and I think we should just stick to that.
6188,"Probably every country that relies on Sinovac, Astra, Sinopharm, J&amp;J (any vaccine that is non mrna) will probably need to rethink their strategy."
6189,The latest official guidance coming out from the Chinese side is 85% domestically vaccinated for herd immunity.
6190,And that's based on having significant access to Sinopharm's higher efficacy and that efficacy not being eroded by variants.
6191,"If herd immunity can only be hit with +80% vaccination rates, then there is really a chance for some countries to never get out of covid spread."
6192,Abdala is definitely breaking some new ground with their tech and the interim results from Cuba are promising.
6193,But its also not going to be a magic bullet (like pfizer or moderna) by any stretch.
6194,Abdala is a 3 dose vaccine with the third dose on the 28th day after the first dose.
6195,Efficacy also is measured from 14 days from the final dose.
6196,"The longer vaccination timeline is a huge challenge, both in terms of getting people back for two doses and in terms of logistics."
6197,"I suspect we'll see a lot of infection and spread due to premature celebration (just like how there was a surge in Mongolia due to people celebrating with Sinopharm, which is also 28 days between first and last dose)."
6198,Ya just look at their cancer vaccine.........
6199,It does when pretty much anything bad that could happen at school is more likely than your kid getting severe covid.
6200,Most likely both.
6201,A new variant or 2 which is protected by vaccines.
6202,The real question is if someone is protected by natural immunity if they got Covid back in November.
6203,masks at walmart is like banning assault rifles.
6204,it prevents almost none of the actual problem.
6205,you can't requite the shot.
6206,"and no matter what the govt and media is telling you, most people aren't taking that shot."
6207,i'm also not getting tested for covid because i have no symtoms.
6208,and if i got an anti-body test and i DID have antibodies (which provides REAL protection) it doesn't matter because people like you only care about the shot.
6209,"They tried it in Czech Republic too, the only reason it didn't happen was the gun depot terror attack revelations which basically ended our relations with Russians."
6210,After kids can be vaccinated.
6211,Still shitty for the small number who want to be vaccinated but can’t.
6212,"It's true, not many people like myself who got the shot and ditched the mask."
6213,Saying they don't catch covid is a blatant lie.
6214,"They aren't as affected by covid, but they still catch it."
6215,Low likelihood does not equate to statistically insignificant or the CDC would state it is statistically insignificant.
6216,They don't.
6217,They state that it is less likely.
6218,"Geezus, good luck with that."
6219,"Maybe see if you can get the box labeled ""PORN."""
6220,"The most amazing posts I see on reddit are people who have survived bad parenting and/or evolved way beyond just the previous generation, somehow."
6221,I got myself kicked out of the house at 21 and it was the best thing that ever happened to me.
6222,"Last year, most covid treatment was free."
6223,"Insurers have been shifting that back, though, and I expect that to continue."
6224,"Of course, the first thing the party of ""personal responsibility"" will do is to declare bankruptcy to escape their debt."
6225,"Couldn't be arsed to mask, couldn't be arsed to vax, can't be arsed to pay."
6226,i feel ban for those that are immunocompromised who arent as well protected with the vaccines even on the first strain much less new ones and kids who arent old enough to get it or whose parents wont let them.
6227,if you have the ability to get vaccinated and you refuse to that is on you at this point.
6228,It’s not just about the deaths.
6229,Kids or adults.
6230,There is.
6231,And it's not just get vaccinated.
6232,Tell people the government will NOT cover covid treatment if you choose not to get vaccinated and are hospitalized.
6233,Let em fuck around then.
6234,Oh well.
6235,Their problem.
6236,It is not uncommon to wear a cloth mask over your N95 to be less obtrusive or just for a style statement.
6237,Designer cloth masks are popular and to many seem less intimidating.
6238,The US government has been ignoring the plight of veterans forever.
6239,Too expensive to treat.
6240,I have no doubt we'll see the same with long covid sufferers.
6241,This should happen relatively quickly.
6242,US is most likely at 200+ million combined vaccinated and natural immunity.
6243,Only about 50 million to go!
6244,And schools.
6245,&gt;It has been found in several countries but has remained at extremely low frequency ...
6246,There is no evidence the strain is currently expanding in any country.
6247,"Also, 200 cases with one death since April..."
6248,It honestly doesn't sound like it's spreading very fast.
6249,"Delta Plus is something to keep an eye on for sure, just as all new variants are, but everything we know so far implies that Delta is the big one."
6250,At least for now.
6251,Well done Cuba.
6252,"This all makes sense but people have been celebrating ""x% of infected/hospitalized/dead are unvaccinated"" headlines in the US as proof that the vaccine works."
6253,The CDC and media have really been running with it.
6254,"Some people are confusing this with efficacy (the proof the vaccine works), we even had some military official saying the vaccine was more effective than the trials based on this stat among the DOD."
6255,So it's not surprising some people are alarmed even if 25% of infected in Israel are fully vaccinated.
6256,"The real issue is that the ""x% of people infected with covid are vaccinated"" stat needs more context to be meaningful, including what percent of the general population is vaccinated and for how long."
6257,It's not an all-in-one figure like efficacy.
6258,But there is a lot less energy here and everywhere to correct misleading stats as long as they are pro-vax.
6259,when they said the south would rise again i was hoping they didnt mean this.
6260,Duh.
6261,I’m sorry…can you tell me how you can see a person getting infected on a video?
6262,"What, exactly, does that look like?"
6263,*waves at fellow Austrian 🇦🇹*
6264,Yep just like when places reinstated lockdowns and told us we couldn’t have holiday gatherings- the ship had sailed.

6283,Anyone who says anything else isn’t being reasonable and are listening to emotion rather than reason.
6284,Tl;dr is this is true if precautions are in place.
6285,"Interesting part to me was:

&gt; Some outbreaks have occurred in schools, leading to closures.36,37 Significant secondary transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection can and does occur in school settings **when prevention strategies are not implemented or are not followed."
6286,"**36 When outbreaks occur in school settings, they tend to result in increased transmission among teachers and school staff rather than among students."
6287,"In Israel, high schools were closed less than two weeks after reopening when two symptomatic students attended in-person learning, leading to 153 cases among students and 25 among staff members, from among 1,161 students and 151 staff members tested.36 Importantly, prevention strategies were not adhered to – including lifting of a mask requirement because of a heat wave and classroom crowding."
6288,It goes on to state that transmission at school is less than in the community if precautions are followed.
6289,[deleted]
6290,"Agreed, we need an indoor mask mandate ... especially given how easily the Delta variant transmits."
6291,There's been multiple cases in Australia of people getting it just by brushing past a person in a crowded store or restaurant.

6313,Good guess
6314,I saw your edit.
6315,Thanks for understanding.
6316,I really am trying to stay positive.
6317,I moved out of mom and Dad’s a couple years back when I got married and we had a little bit of emergency fund in case something bad happened.
6318,6 months into marriage my wife had to have her gallbladder removed and the medical bills basically wiped out our savings and we’re still paying expenses to this day.
6319,6 months after that we lost our jobs to COVID and had to start from square one yet again.
6320,"We’ve also had to have our cars repaired multiple times over the course of the past year, and had to scrounge money to pay for the repairs."
6321,"I recently pre-paid next months rent with money I saved up through my Qapital savings app, so we could have some peace of mind until the first of August."
6322,People are definitely suffering way more than us and I don’t want to ignore the blessings I have.
6323,"It’s just not fun when you’re living paycheck to paycheck, and constantly waiting for something else to go wrong."
6324,In the mean time to make ends meet I’ve been  working at Amazon over the past year.
6325,But even then I signed on as a temp and my contract expires at the end of July.
6326,So I’m praying I can get my job back before that happens.
6327,All in all my frustration extends much further than just me being tired of wearing a mask when I go to Kroger
6328,You should read what I wrote again.
6329,There are a *lot* factors involved.
6330,Like: There are ventilation systems that can reliably clean the air within a comparatively short period of time.
6331,"Then, there’s also the fact that these things are precautions: There are plenty of areas now where the probability that there is just one single person that even spreads the virus in a specific restaurant in a given week is way below 1%."
6332,And it’s not like breathing in a few virus molecules will give you an infection.
6333,There’s a minimum dose that depends on your individual immune system.
6334,"Also, there were studies here in Germany according to which neither schools, nor restaurants, nor movie theatres had any significant spreading events (on the other hand, schools do seem to currently be a major issue in the UK, so just because it’s not an issue in one study in one area at one time doesn’t mean it cannot become a problem later)."
6335,"At that time, most proven chains of infection were people meeting privately, and families living together."
6336,"I've often used WWII as an example: we had rationing, blackouts, etc and the rationing wasn't just food ... fuel and rubber too which ment people really couldn't drive very far or as much as they did before the war."
6337,Yet the American people manned up and did their bit to help the war effort.
6338,Meanwhile today we can't even get people to wear a bit of cloth over their face.
6339,Agreed!
6340,Have faith in science people!
6341,Yet they're probably pro-life.
6342,"What a fucking joke, but that's to be expected of such people."
6343,"Sounds about right, but remember that we fully vaccinated the oldest first, so the 'full vaccinated' group is disproportionately old and vulnerable and the 'single shot' group is massive, while the 'no shot' group are the youngest."
6344,Raw numbers are meaningless without that context.

6421,I'm almost in the opposite situation as you.
6422,Myself and my grandparents are the only people in my entire family who got vaccinated.
6423,"My grandparents said they'd only get it if I did thinking they were like, calling me out or something but I was already trying to get an appointment."
6424,"My parents, aunts, uncles, cousins — one actually _wants_ the shots but her parents won't let her — great aunts and uncles, people I've never met but just heard of — none of them will get vaccinated."
6425,Most of them have never even acknowledged that COVID exists.
6426,My aunt and uncle here in Phoenix actually _had_ COVID this time last year.
6427,"Thankfully they didn't require hospitalization, but they think that's proof that ""it's just the flu"" so they refuse to get themselves and their kids vaccinated."
6428,And they have their kids so afraid of doctors and medicine that there's no way they'd try to go get it on their own.
6429,Maybe if the second shot didn’t make you feel like you got hit by a fucking train and then dropped from a 6 story window more people would get it.
6430,I’ve been feeling worse than I ever have in years since getting my second shot Friday evening.
6431,Good quote to put it in perspective.
6432,"&gt; “Since in Israel 85% of the adult population is vaccinated, even with 90% vaccine effectiveness against the Delta variance, one would expect among adults to see more infections among vaccinated than unvaccinated because of their sheer relative volume,” said Prof."
6433,"Ran Balicer, founding director of the Clalit Research Institute and director of Health Policy Planning for Clalit."
6434,“People find it difficult to understand.
6435,"They say, ‘If I see so many vaccinated people infected in Israel, then it has to be that the vaccine is not effective.’ But this is not the case.”"
6436,"I live in the south, and I haven’t chosen this."
6437,"My fiancée, my friends, my coworkers, and I have all been fully vaccinated for months, and we have supported local efforts to expand vaccinations."
6438,"I say this not as a holier than though message, more so as a way to remind people that just because people are stubborn doesn’t mean we should stop our efforts to increase vaccination rates."
6439,"This is my home, and I have no way (financially or emotionally) to leave it."
6440,We’re not the only ones like this either.
6441,So keep supporting organizations and politicians who will assist in increasing vaccination rates in the rural south whenever you can.
6442,I'm in the corona sub lol.
6443,I can't escape this pain.
6444,I am glad.
6445,Israel has not reported a single COVID death in *weeks*.
6446,It is easy to scare people with statistics out of context; it is accurate to say “Israel’s cases have gone up 900%!!
6447,!” But when that means cases went from 14 a day to 140… well that’s not very serious is it?
6448,They were reporting over 8000 per day a few months ago.
6449,"Same with the UK, their case rate has gone up by about the same percent, but their death rate is practically nothing."
6450,"Small surges in cases among the unvaccinated or partially vaccinated, with a few breakthrough cases, was always something we anticipated."
6451,&gt; I have a chronic pain disorder and still have to put on a happy face at work for 40 hours a week.
6452,That's the worst thing about it.

6460,Your scenario is only true in double-blind trials in which both the placebo and the vaccinated groups are of the size and behave similarly.
6461,"Given 100 cases of covid, how many are vaccinated depends HEAVILY on how much of the population is already vaccinated, so it can't be indicative of the vaccine effectiveness because the effectiveness does not change with vaccination progress (ignoring possibility of variants."
6462,That's not relevant to the discussion here).
6463,"I know 4 people, ranging in ages from 40-58, who had J&amp;J."
6464,"Side effects were very mild, if there were any at all."
6465,The 40 year old had COVID and was quite ill (not hospitalized but sick enough that his wife was thinking about calling an ambulance) back in March.

6505,"It means that if you attend an event where there's a 10% chance of contracting covid before vaccination, now you only have a 0.5% chance of contracting covid."
6506,This value has nothing to do with how many people have been vaccinated in the population.
6507,The amount of protection provided is the same whether 1000 have been vaccinated or 10M have been vaccinated.
6508,"In contrast, if half of all covid patients are vaccinated, this quantity is affected both by the efficacy of the vaccines and by how many people have been vaccinated."
6509,"It would be much more alarming if this happened while only 1% of the population are vaccinated, versus if 99% of the population are vaccinated."
6510,You are correct that it tends to be in the 70-80% range for those aged 12+.
6511,That is almost for sure below the herd immunity threshold.
6512,"However, it should substantially slow the spread and keep hospital capacity in check, especially given that those most likely to be hospitalized are also most likely to be vaccinated."

6527,"No free ride for the unvaccinated, they are gonna get sick eventually... some of them have already had COVID, so that will help some of them, but you can get it twice and I assume the Delta will definitely hit some of those people who already had it harder than if they were vaccinated."

6531,"Clearly, ""Free Chick-fil-A"" is the way to get people to vax."

6542,Simple.
6543,The corona Vax appears to be different.
6544,"""No Vax, wear mask, probably won't get sick, but we might, but even then we'll be fine, unless we're old."
6545,"Or.. Get Vax, still have to wear mask, still can spread it, still might get sick, but if we do get sick then it will be less bad, unless it's a new variant, then we will probably be ok, or maybe not."""
6546,It's just not as simple and straightforward.
6547,So that is how us regular people are confused.
6548,"We don't think the Vax is a ""cure"", we think it's a ""prevention""."
6549,"But we are confused what exactly it is ""preventing"" if we can still get it, still spread it, still have to wear masks.."
6550,I have school-aged children as well so you raise an interesting point.
6551,All things being equal and IF we hit 80% fully vaccinated by return to school I personally would be surprised if masks were still mandated for them.

6660,"True, would just add that even the small percentage who are vaccinated and do catch the virus are FAR more likely to have a mild case and significantly less likely to be hospitalized or to die."
6661,"So yeah, the vaccines are awesome, super excited to get my second dose Monday, and it’s still worth exercising basic precautions and common sense."
6662,&gt; Is there a benefit to doing so?
6663,"If you can get it done relatively inexpensive or for free, it feeds data back into the system so we know about breakthrough infections."
6664,[deleted]
6665,The only reason to slow it down is to buy time for vaccines to be available and distributed.
6666,There is literally no other reason to bother.
6667,No clue they invoiced me like 18xx for it and I forwarded to employer
6668,"Literally yes, any virus can."
6669,"Look up what happened after the Spanish flu pandemic, people were complaining of the same symptoms they are today to the point where it affected economic productivity."
6670,"This is the seasonal flu virus we get today, it became endemic."
6671,If you get mono there's a very high chance you'll also have the same long term symptoms too.
6672,"But according to the who were supposed to go back to wearing masks, social distancing, and avoiding large crowds’s?"
6673,"I have a feeling, and I hope that I'm wrong, that we'll find out that the AZ vaccine is not effective enough against the Delta variant to prevent a large-scale outbreak in the UK."
6674,"I don't know if that will mean deaths, or just many people going to the hospital though."
6675,She’s already vaccinated.
6676,Not sure if that ruins it but I suspect it would.
6677,"I just want to be able to attend a conference on which my career options strongly depend...

(In Norway btw, but same issue: vaccination is by age slice, my turn simply hasn't come yet, it is now clear it won't come in time.)"
6678,I’d love to go back and see the discussion from prior to the pandemic but unfortunately Reddit doesn’t make it easy to jump to a certain date.
6679,There exists some degree of cross immunity between coronaviruses.
6680,"Lots of countries that have high(ish) vaccination rates already found J&amp;J (one-shot) to be useful in order to vaccinate people who are difficult to get hold of, or likely to miss the appointment for their second dose because of life-circumstances."
6681,Those include refugees as well as homeless people.
6682,But also women being in hiding from abusive husbands and possible moving from safe-house to safe-house a lot.
6683,Maybe the TGA believes that having J&amp;J approved might become useful in a few months time.
6684,"If the Australian government suddenly realises that there are marginal groups in society that would benefit from J&amp;J, and Canberra can get hold of a batch then, at least they won't have to wait for regulatory approval."
6685,"Although, from what I've heard, as a general rule the Australian government does not really care all that much about the needs of marginal groups in society...."
6686,All relative and locally related.
6687,"Here, we would have been completely unrestricted from this week, but new daily Delta infection cases are increasing at about +40% per week, and nightclubs are fully open, tourists are filling tourist spots again, etc."
6688,"It's why I urge Americans to take Delta seriously, we're at similar vaccination levels, but it's ripping through the place."
6689,Only depend on God &amp; my own  immunity...
6690,That’s literally not what it says at all.
6691,The UK has been seeing an increase in cases for a month now and the hospital and death rates have not followed the trend.
6692,One month is more than enough time to have started to see the increase if it was going to happen.
6693,The article said nothing at all about the vaccination regiment the UK uses being ineffective.
6694,"Heart attack and heart inflammation are very different though, aren't they?"
6695,I hope you're joking.
6696,Why would you drink alcohol after getting the vaccine and mess up the immune system response?
6697,You're not supposed to drink alcohol for like 48 hours lol
6698,My second shot was awful.
6699,One of the worst experiences in my life.
6700,The worst didn’t last long though.
6701,About six hours.
6702,"The headache lasted for a week, but it did ease."
6703,"The relief I felt though, after that two weeks… to just feel like it was all over w/no mask etc."
6704,like life was back to normal… was an amazing feeling.
6705,"I don’t want to do it again, but will if necessary."
6706,"My whole family, from my mom &amp; dad, teenage boys, brother, aunt, uncle and cousins had nothing but a sore arm."
6707,Pfizer and Moderna.
6708,"I took the Moderna, but honestly, I think if you’re gonna have an extreme inflammatory response like me, you’d probably get it with either shot."
6709,"Since just as many take both with minor to no side effects, then the handful on both sides with experiences like mine."
6710,Because the vaccines are wildly effective?
6711,"Just because they aren’t actual magic armour, doesn’t mean they don’t offer superb immunity, well beyond anyone’s original expectations."
6712,"The variants have eroded the efficacy *slightly* (https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/uk-study-finds-vaccines-offer-high-protection-against-hospitalisation-delta-2021-06-14/) ie a few percentage points, that’s all."
6713,And the article didn't say that 2-10% of people who take the covid vaccine don't seroconvert.
6714,"On the other hand, we've seen a high rate of seroconversion even in immunocompromised patients."
6715,Vaccines work.
6716,"Reddit has a large proportion of shut-ins compared to the general population, many of whom have enjoyed that they have had the moral highground the last year."
6717,They don't want to give it up.
6718,I'm curious.
6719,Do you have any other health conditions (if you're okay sharing)?
6720,And what reactions/severity did you have to the vaccine?
6721,This post appears to be about vaccines.
6722,"We encourage you to read our helpful resources on the COVID-19 vaccines:

6724,*
6725,"I must have missed anyone saying vaccines were 100%, but this is headline news here?"
6726,FFS.
6727,Interesting.
6728,Thanks!
6729,Also the figureheads are compelled to make some sort of recommendation.
6730,"So they're faced with difficult decisions - if they recommend masks initially, then look what happened to the run on food/TP."
6731,What would that do to the hospitals if they can't procure PPE and then how will that affect death rates if hospitals can't treat people.
6732,But then people interpret the recommendation as masks don't work.
6733,Because of 1 stupid study which had summary conclusions which didn't match the methods.
6734,"Perhaps they should have recommended cloth masks initially, but then you may still have a run on N95s."
6735,"They eventually settled for logistics control - confiscate horded PPE, bar N95s from Amazon, etc and then came out with reasonable masking recommendations."
6736,Not easy decisions.
6737,Then we do have political and monetary influences - pushing expensive patented treatments like Remdesivir and downplaying effectiveness of alternative treatments like HCQ or Ivermectin.
6738,While also making stock market investments.
6739,"Compound with cut corners, albeit a necessity to reduce total deaths, on vaccine safety testing."
6740,"Rat studies and cancer patient studies do show some harm from LNP, but it's lower risk than the disease, and so here we are."
6741,Then the irony of echo chambers.
6742,"The pro science crowd ironically calls themselves educated and others dumb/crazy when the fact is that they're less informed about the research and data than someone who may be more risk averse and actively keeping abreast of studies, findings, and risks."
6743,"And then on the other side of the coin you have the echo chambers of the actual crazies, who are also too lazy to educate themselves but of course like to self congratulate and spread nonsense within their bubbles."
6744,"Really, 90% of people are clueless and just relying on second hand information and intuition."
6745,how is it selfish tho?
6746,for months prior to vaccines people were like think of grandma lmao and now grandma is vaxd now the narrative is think of the 12 year olds.
6747,"everyone who needs a vaccine has gotten one, this doesn't need to go any further."
6748,"sounds like people just enjoy having nothing to do, and don't want to feel bad about so they want people locked down too."
6749,"Sorry if you don't have a life worth living, but I do."
6750,The latter
6751,I think flu is less dangerous for older people is more like survive bias.
6752,"Flu has been around for who knows how long, people who are more vulnerable to flu already passed at young age."
6753,"Combined with multiple infection/immunization through life time, older people today have more immunity against flu."
6754,"As for covid, nobody has immunity, so impact is greater for more vulnerable people."
6755,I have 3 kids and every year I was sick from sept-November.
6756,Just passing the same virus around.
6757,Normalizing masks when your sick is a brilliant idea and we should be adopting that.
6758,I totally get why people are tired of masks but if we’re sending our kids to school sick and we’re going to work sick we…two things we should most definitely not be doing…we should be wearing masks.
6759,This is exactly what I try to tell my unvaccinated patients.
6760,Is it going to prevent you from getting COVID 100%?
6761,No.
6762,But what it WILL do is allow you to have mild flu-like symptoms as opposed to being on a ventilator.
6763,"Agreed, but with the slight distinction of “out of hospital and/or not needing extensive or ongoing medical care”."
6764,"Obviously not as bad as being in hospital, but can still massively compromise quality of life and throw a major wrench in the healthcare system."
6765,"That said, the vaccines are amazing and are holding up well thus far to the variants."
6766,"Would like to see some data about any vaccinated individuals who happen to get the virus and the likelihood of long Covid, but all signs point to that being less likely in vaccinated individuals too."
6767,"Second shot on Monday baby, can’t wait!"
6768,What do you mean may?
6769,"This isn't a preventative vaccine, it just prevents you from going to the ICU if you get sick..."
6770,I read that the vast majority of people who get the vaccine develop antibodies.
6771,"Blood tests for antibodies could be particularly valuable to the immunocompromised, however."
6772,Hm.
6773,Weird in what way?
6774,Or just weird in that it's weird to make a sub about the common cold?
6775,He's talking about everyone else here saying that there's no link between the heart issue and the jab
6776,"Effective against severe disease = hospitalization   
It doesn't mean shielding people against getting covid."
6777,Is it millions of doses in the specific age group he's talking about?
6778,"I was wearing a full face respirator with p100 and it was 100%safe for me inside but yeah, you can't speak that well without shouting ."
6779,Thank you!
6780,For the support
6781,"I’d choose being severely hungover over, rather  the second shot
Side effects I endured."
6782,Although I’m the only one in my family to go though what I did.
6783,"My job has finally offered recovery time off, after I got mine."
6784,"I of course, said there is no way I’d put myself through that again…."
6785,"But I probably will, given enough time and if vaccinated people end up being more and more susceptible to variants."
6786,"Because those few weeks in June when I felt worry free, no mask… just like the old times… were amazing."
6787,I’m starting to feel a tad anxious though.
6788,I wish more people would get vaccinated….
6789,"But with numbers stagnant, and variants seemingly breaking through more and more when there are mutations."
6790,"I feel like with this trend, I’ll be wearing my mask everywhere again, in the near future."
6791,"I hope not, but it’s not looking good."
6792,"Yep, just like the Asian people in my community I’ll be wearing a mask when I get sick from now on."
6793,Because I’m fully vaccinated I will no longer be doing it as a prophylactic however (unless mandated by local regulations).
6794,"I have done my part to reduce my likelihood as a vector, and fully understand that no vaccine is 100% effective."
6795,It’s the same reason I get the flu shot every year.
6796,If other people want to wear masks over a 5% - 10% chance of vaccine failure they are fully within their rights of course!
6797,"Did I write ""all known variants?"""
6798,I highlighted Delta variant in my original post.
6799,"Because I didn't use the word Delta in front of variant each time said variant, that is a misrepresentation?"
6800,"The irony is I hope by this winter, I'm completely wrong and you are right."
6801,Vaccinations protect the Earth from Delta.
6802,Nothing to worry about.
6803,"As I said, I'm glad I'm wrong about the vaccines being impossible to develop in a year or less."
6804,"I mean, they are private insurance, so they likely can."
6805,"yeah, but it sure as hell beats feeling shitty for 30 days or more..."
6806,"Pretty sure everyone here knows this, but thanks."
6807,And cases were rising in FL this time in 2020.
6808,"It’s stagnant now, but better than rising!"
6809,Its relative.
6810,My state hasn't had any restrictions since March.
6811,We would have huge protests if there will still restrictions.
6812,"Fair do's, I'm only speaking for Englanders, which most of the London protesters will statistically be :)"
6813,"Yeah, the ""resigning because of breaching covid guidelines"" is just an excuse to shift the focus away from the real scandal."
6814,You are right about acceptable risk.
6815,We ain't there yet.
6816,Hell not even half of America is vaccinated yet.
6817,Many societies have been wearing masks when ill/exposed to illness for DECADES.
6818,"COVID is more challenging because of the commonality of asymptomatic transmission (which is much, much less common with the flu or common cold)."
6819,"As such, masking in crowded places with low vaccination rates and/or during a spike in infections will need to be a more fluid, variable decision, but one that I would hope that any sensible, community minded person would consider until vaccination rates are higher/infections are lower."
6820,"Alrighty, you’re getting cringe."
6821,Good luck out there.
6822,✌️
6823,drinking alcohol while losing the sense of taste was the best thing for me about COVID
6824,"Dang, you got me haha."
6825,Touche.
6826,"I would too, but I always have to remember Walensky’s “imminent doom” that never came."
6827,Walensky is too emotional to be trusted.
6828,It’s disgraceful to the American public and especially to women seeking authoritative positions.
6829,[deleted]
6830,In countries where vaccines are accessible and plentiful another lockdown makes zero sense.
6831,I’m not giving up my way of life because some asshats cousin shared some bullshit on Facebook.
6832,"I did my part for 15 months not dining inside, not visiting with friends indoors, working from home, wearing a mask and ultimately getting vaccinated at the first available opportunity."
6833,Pandemic is over for this guy.
6834,It says in the article they believe there is a disconnect between case numbers and hospitalisation/deaths.
6835,Did you read the article?

6840,"I was more concerned with the government extending unemployment at the time, as I have been laid off since June and that was a very important thing for me to focus on since my benefits were about to run dry."
6841,"Thankfully, I’ll be back at work this Wednesday finally."
6842,"I knew there was a wave going on, it just wasn’t a main focus for me at the time."
6843,This is the first airborne detector that I have seen reach commercial status.
6844,I wonder if it will be adopted in other applications throughout the world.
6845,"From the data I have consulted (https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f987078916d5b125273456b/t/5ff71f9df931341f51c71d3b/1610031017877/Kontrol+BioCloud+Data+Sheet\_Jan+6\_2021\_compressed.pdf), it seems to have actual scientific backing."
6846,Very interesting.
6847,"I wonder if insurance can basically say ""we won't cover treatment for a disease that could have been prevented by vaccination, unless you were a breakthrough case""."
6848,I would hope that the CDC continues to make evidence-based decisions unlike Israel.
6849,"&gt; are too dumb 

Funny you should mention that, considering that you think pushing a syringe into someone's arm requires the same amount of resources as taking a sample, transporting that sample, testing that sample, recording the results and providing them to the person tested."
6850,"I realize you think you know what you're talking about, but you don't."
6851,You also might have killed somebody from the flu (like unknowingly handing it to an autoimmune compromised person).
6852,Were you as concerned then?
6853,Genuinely curious.
6854,I just got my first cold since the pandemic started and frankly?
6855,I'm chillin
6856,The point is that’s true but they still reintroduced masks.
6857,Who’s to say it can’t happen here?
6858,[removed]
6859,I'm in Canada and we have antibody testing here.
6860,You have to request it from his doctor.
6861,Great idea.
6862,Am totally going to ask my doc to check all my titres at my next appointment.
6863,I imagine that they’re not yet equipped to check to COVID vaccine titres (or maybe they are?
6864,"Genuinely have no idea), but such a good thing to keep track of."
6865,People always assume 100%.
6866,That is super unrealistic.
6867,It is far more likely to be like polio.
6868,"Not gone, but for a large majority of the world, gone."
6869,"And with enough people mostly immune, it is FAR less likely to mutate."
6870,That is what we need to shoot for as a planet.
6871,Delta Variant is no fucking joke

6924,"We're barely restricted in normal life, you can do just about all normal life things, so holding on a few more weeks so the majority population who aren't double vaccinated yet get to have at least a single vaccine dose to reduce their risk of life long implications isn't a great hardship, really."

6926,"My experience with j&amp;j vaccine:

I (27 F) had covid in January, extremely mild."
6927,101.5 fever that went away and never came back after taking 1 Tylenol.

6936,Can you please keep us posted on your symptoms?
6937,"Also, if you don’t mind me asking… how old are you?"
6938,&gt; I think flu is less dangerous for older people is more like survive bias.
6939,"eh, I don't think survivor bias is really it, more like those that either never got infected with influenza or those that their immune system is too weak to fight it off."
6940,"Influenza would be extremely dangerous if a novel pandemic strain popped up, entirely possible to be far worse than covid, but covid being a clotting/blood disease means it attacks the body differently from flu."
6941,"It being worse in older people could be a function of multiple factors, some of which will be survivor bias, some will be immune response to influenza, and some will be the fact that your heart and lungs naturally get weaker as you get older, and a disease which causes blood clotting and attacks the cardiovascular system has the possibility to be much more severe than one that hits primarily the respiratory system."
6942,"&gt; As for covid, nobody has immunity, so impact is greater for more vulnerable people."
6943,That's not true.
6944,"Covid some some cross-reactivity with antibodies from OG SARS/MERS, as well as a couple of the milder corona virus strains that circulate every couple years."
6945,"Your immune response isn't as strong against covid as it is flu, but it's incorrect to say no one had immunity or working antibodies to it prior to the start of the pandemic."
6946,"&gt;  older people today have more immunity against flu

Yes, this is true, however in the populations that covid hits hardest influenza is not even remotely close to it."
6947,"Like, we're talking covid is several orders of magnitude more deadly in the 65+ range given that influenza is like, .8% at that age range and covid is something like 25%+

It's not explainable by people having some cross-reactive immunity against new flu strains (although, like I said, that's a significant part of it)."
6948,"Hi captain strawman, sorry I’m opposed to evidence based policy but I really think there is some value in swift action in the absence of evidence."

6951,More teenagers have died of COVID since the vaccine was available to them than have died from myocarditis.
6952,Myocarditis is easily treated with nsaids and usuay resolves without any long term effect.
6953,We understand the grand strategy is immunity through vaccination.
6954,It's just a matter of vaccine supply.
6955,The government backed AZ and unfortunately it turned out to be no good.
6956,So they quickly pivoted to Pfizer but bulk of deliveries won't arrive until October.
6957,They can't start a marketing campaign or open up vaccination to all ages right now because it would create demand for a product that isn't there yet.
6958,"When Oct rolls around, we'll see the program ramp up to 100%."
6959,"There is a SMALL chance it says, misleading title"
6960,I honestly haven’t had time to get vaccinated and am totally cool just wearing a mask everywhere.
6961,Kinda sucks for vaccinated people it’s just a false sense of security now.

6964,The government refused to do a total lockdown and is instead implementing “small lockdowns” in certain neighborhoods.
6965,The only good news I guess is that they’ve recently been ramping up their vaccine distribution.
6966,"My sister just got her second dose of Sinovac so after 2 weeks, everyone in my family will be fully vaccinated."
6967,Hoping we can hit 1 million vaccinations per day very soon.
6968,"It's not how, it's to whom."
6969,"With anti vaxxers, just go do something smarter, like kick a pissed off pit bull terrier in the scrotum while he's eating."
6970,If with normal people - just give them some wikipedia links about vaccination
6971,I find this extremely selfish and a political game putting lives at risk.
6972,Why not give these doses to their population?

7146,[removed]
7147,I think it's because it's been shown that vaccines significantly lower the risk of transmission.
7148,"So even if a vaxxed person gets it, with no symptoms, most of them fight it off before they can spread it wide."
7149,"That was always the thing that drove the spread with covid, that people were contagious before they know they have it."
7150,Mask do help and are one of the best ways to stop transmission.

7220,Delta plus doesn't effect two dose.
7221,It can get you sick just like all viruses can and probably have but it won't get you severely sick.
7222,It's not like alpha hasn't gotten you sick if you're roaming around without the vaccine.
7223,We don't have a magical barrier around us...
7224,It's the viral load that matters.
7225,Asymptomatic cases will only show on the tests if they are testing people.
7226,If they don't you'll never know you have it and you won't spread it either.
7227,Same with these you might just have more of a reaction to it which is kinda a good thing cause then you will stay home.
7228,"So, the last sentence of the person you responded to?"
7229,Thanks.
7230,"I recall, a few years ago, a poor kid dying from Diphtheria because his parents refused to get him vaccinated for anything."
7231,His parents will have to live with that for the rest of their lives.
7232,I know it’s a race against evolution.
7233,And I know we are doing our best.
7234,And I’m not even angry if I have to mask or social distance again.
7235,I cannot do another lockdown; that would be Hell.
7236,See another comment in a thread about my definition of Hell.
7237,Single dose is essentially unvaccinated since they haven’t had enough time for the immune response to build
7238,"True, but if the 80% of vaccinated people have the same amount of cases as the 20% of unvaccinated ones, it suggests the vaccine is cutting raw case numbers by around 3/4 (admittedly, given the low case numbers so far it's difficult to draw firm conclusions), so that could still make a pretty big difference even before you get to how much the vaccine affects transmissibility for those who do get it."
7239,"And I suspect that at least some of the unvaccinated 20% could probably have the vaccine, which would help."
7240,Given the woeful level of protection afforded by Sinovax and Sputnik 5 this variant will hit especially hard.
7241,Indonesia has seen this first hand amongst their health care providers.
7242,What’s Deez ?
7243,/s
7244,"I haven't seen any data on this, but I'd bet that there's a strong correlation in Israel between people who are very religious and people who haven't been vaccinated."
7245,So I bet that places with the most strongly religious people are the places where this outbreak is going to mostly happen.
7246,I hope so.
7247,Kinda sucks for the people who got vaccinated when the vaccines first started rolling out and are hitting their 9 months as soon as countries start to finally welcome tourists again.
7248,“Thinking of covid at all” was a bit of an exaggeration.
7249,Are the people you know sheltering in place and avoiding gatherings?
7250,I’ll rephrase.
7251,Most people are not significantly altering their lives due to covid anymore.

It doesn't  matter if the hospitals are begging people to wear masks when there are people who see scientists as an enemy pushing a demonic agenda to strip them of freedom

Many people will not care until someone close to them dies or nearly dies"
7254,Because the vaccines in the US have no problems with variants and the mRna vaccines never will.
7255,"That is why, this report is actually about the Chinese and Russian vaccines and they are not effective against variants."
7256,The title left that out.
7257,It is for some people.
7258,My understanding FWIW is that there is evolutionary pressure for viruses to evolve in ways that evade the current vaccines.
7259,"This makes intuitive sense, since there is a larger population of hosts in the case of variants that can infect vaccinated people, so such mutations are ""successful"" in an evolutionary sense."
7260,"I don't know how much of that we are seeing at the moment, since so few people worldwide have been vaccinated to date (about 15% I believe)."
7261,"Apparently the best thing to do with Coronavirus is to vaccinate everybody overnight, so the existing virus population has nowhere to go and  also no opportunities to mutate."
7262,"The worst thing to do is to have a very slow rolling vaccination program, so that there's a large ongoing population of people who can breed different variants of the virus that can then try to replicate in vaccinated people."
7263,"This is one of the things I worry about since we seem to be headed in the direction of the latter type of program, especially considering the planet has a whole."
7264,Bioterrorists gonna bioterror I guess
7265,"In the United States, there were people dying of covid in the intensive care unit and there were still ranting that it was a hoax."
7266,"The Delta variant is not a brand new pandemic though, despite a lot of the rhetoric about “well what about what people said about covid Jan-March 2020?"
7267,"?”

There’s really no reason to believe that Delta is a looming monster that will set us back to square one."
7268,"Unvaccinated people are a problem, but we know currently that the vaccinated are protected."
7269,That’s huge.
7270,"I’m willing to change my opinion if presented with new information, but it’s definitely not looking like time to ring the lockdown alarm bells right now."

7288,I had one kid that argued about this and threatened to get it on her own .
7289,I had the vaccine myself but I was dumbfounded by her behavior.
7290,It was more related to all her friends getting it then her need of it .
7291,&gt; That number is TINY if you put it into context.
7292,"I think people don't realize how few 4,100 is."
7293,That's 10% of the capacity of a typical MLB stadium.
7294,"At the start of the baseball season, when stadiums were at restricted capacities, many were still allowing around 10,000 fans in."
7295,"You might've watched a game back in April and said ""Wow, look at how few people there are in the stadium""."
7296,"4,100 is still less than half of that."
7297,Across the entire country.
7298,"In terms of money and percentages, imagine you had $330,000,000."
7299,"$4,100 is 0.00124% of that."
7300,Let's bring that down to a more manageable number that more people are probably used to.
7301,"If you had $10,000, that same percentage is 12 cents."
7302,"It's been said that humans are terrible at comprehending big numbers (Like how everyone is surprised to find out that a million seconds is 12 days, a billion seconds is 31 years, etc) but they're just as bad at comprehending tiny numbers."
7303,[removed]
7304,"Um, most people I know are absolutely still thinking of Covid, regardless of their position on vaccines and mitigation measures."

7306,Mutations happen.
7307,Just a fact of life and they will continue to happens since there’s 0 scenarios where this thing will be eradicated forever.
7308,Everyone who wants a vaccine in the US has the ability to get one and they’re still very protective against variants.
7309,Hospitals are no longer at risk of being overwhelmed either.
7310,And the immuno compromised would’ve had to be extra careful covid or no covid so this is daily life for them anyway.
7311,At some point we gotta move on
7312,What does this have to do with being a trained doctor?
7313,"Cool your jets, man."
7314,I got vaccinated.
7315,My friends are all vaccinated.
7316,Every woman I've talked to has had weird effects on their menstruation directly after getting vaccinated.
7317,I don't need a medical degree to see that correlation.
7318,"News is reporting the heart effects on boys, but it's sparse, and I sure as hell have heard nothing about the other issue."
7319,"It is very hard to predict where it is going to peak, but if we look at the trajectory, it is going to take a miracle to suddenly stop that increase."
7320,"Both in UK and in Portugal, with high vaccination rates and high Delta prevalence, numbers are increasing fast."
7321,"In both countries, Rt is well above 1, UK cases graph has a slope that is almost vertical."
7322,"And in other countries in EU, it is deceptive because case numbers are very low, but in reality the number of Delta variant cases are doubling every 5-14 days."
7323,"There is a very clear trend, that is why my prediction is that we are going to easily surpass the previous peaks, I hope I'm wrong."
7324,[deleted]
7325,I wore a mask for a year and a half while cases and deaths were spiking everywhere and mask wearing compliance was 99%.
7326,I got 2 doses of an mRNA vaccine and so did millions of others and cases and deaths plummeted.
7327,"I’d take more boosters over wearing a mask, in public at least."
7328,Wearing a mask at home with family in close quarters is better than wearing it for 5 minutes in Target.
7329,"This, Tampa bay is horrid right now."
7330,Ah yes a full year and a half with minimal social interaction and depression and it's still people being unreasonable for being upset things are going slowly even after they get the vaccination
7331,"Yeah, it would be great if anyone could provide an actual counter-argument instead of just clicking their little ""shut up!"""
7332,"button, lol"
7333,I wouldn't say dystopian but definitely fucked up.
7334,Do you have any information about the effect of two shots against the variant?
7335,"I'm still wearing a mask, sanitizing hands, and really not going much of anywhere aside from work if I have to."
7336,The vast majority of my town (tourists included) seem to think this is over and are going maskless when cases are climbing.
7337,I’m personally looking forward to the Delta Pro Max variant.
7338,"Personally, I think vaccination (barring medical exception, of course) should be mandatory for employment in the US."
7339,A lot of companies are already doing this.
7340,"It sucks that it might have to come down to threatening people’s livelihoods, but that’ll certainly get people off their butts."
7341,"Accessibility is a huge issue that should be considered as you’ve said, but a lot of it is pure selfishness and I can’t think of a way around that save for strict vaccine mandates."
7342,The Moderna and Pfizer vaccines have no problems with the variants.
7343,Nither does J&amp;J now the Russians and Chinese vaccines will or any of the no mRna vaccines.
7344,"Imagine caring so little about the welfare of your child, you choose to not vaccinate them against a deadly contagion."
7345,There’s a lot to be said for needing to pass a test in order to be allowed to procreate.
7346,Nah fam we good.
7347,"No, it was far less successful at spreading."
7348,"If it was anywhere near as contagious as Covid, it would have run wild, despite killing a bunch of people."
7349,The lack of empathy for kids and people that can't get the vaccine is awesome!
7350,[removed]
7351,"Vulnerable and teens should be the absolute *last* to be vaccinated, but the CDC won’t actually update their info at all."
7352,"Both groups have much higher incidence of severe side effects after vaccination, still not an insane amount, but way closer to a 1-5% range than 0%."
7353,"All the average completely healthy people should be getting it first, but, they’re also by and large the exact type of person to have a higher incidence of being against the vaccine since they see themselves as healthy and will be fine."
7354,We’ll never reach herd immunity at least in America.
7355,[deleted]
7356,"He could be right, in the sense that mask mandates have been dropped by many states, and the Delta variant can be spread in 5 seconds by simply walking by someone in a mall."
7357,(and likely spread from vaxxed to unvaxxed and vice versa) So...if states do not re-enact mask mandates...you could be looking at a wave as big or worse than last time.
7358,That is possible with the current lack of guidelines.
7359,This is Russia though right?
7360,They have less than 12% vaccinated with 2 doses.
7361,"No, it just needs long enough to spread."
7362,"Once you had it, you're a waste of resources, as far as the virus is concerned, due to immunity."
7363,"It would long-term be better for the virus to kill more, which would encourage people to have more kids to replace the dead, more people that can be infected."
7364,Great news !
7365,We were hit so hard early on in this pandemic.
7366,You know what's really gonna hurt your young child?
7367,Getting Covid and dying.
7368,Yes.
7369,It's not going back on
7370,The US is going to be dealing with this for years because of all the antivaxers and petulant children who don’t want to wear a mask
7371,Even then they won’t care.
7372,"I’ve lost count of the number of people here who have said something to the effect of “if I give rona to my elderly dad and he gets sick and dies, well he’s had a good life”."
7373,"There are a lot of people, especially through the southern US, that have lost parents and other close relatives that have not changed bupkis and refuse to."
7374,Sorry OP.
7375,You may be right about where you live but you are wrong about the entire planet.
7376,Fox News needs to be sued into oblivion for all this shit.
7377,Millions more are going to die because of their propaganda.
7378,Well that’s why it’s imperative to ensure widespread vaccine coverage.
7379,"Given the slightly lower efficacy, probably prevention of infection would be lower, but the sterilizing immunity induced is still almost 80%, and we know asymptomatic vaccinated infections transmit drastically less."
7380,Fully vaccinated and it feels like you can’t trust your community to keep itself safe by doing the same.
7381,Guess I’ll continue to mask because even a mild case of Covid can have lifelong effects.
7382,What about the children who can’t get the vaccine yet?
7383,Sadly they might be the biggest victims
7384,What are the chances we will shutdown again?
7385,"What pharmacies do you go to that ""literally built for sick people""?"
7386,Every pharmacy is basically a whole store with a pharmacy attached.
7387,"Hell, a lot of grocery stores have pharmacies and almost every store in the country sells all the same over the counter medications."
7388,"So, tell me, what is so special about a pharmacy that makes it so much more likely to encounter an infectious person there vs. a grocery store, or any Walmart type store?"
7389,"Last I checked, there are every few prescription medications that have any efficacy against the standard infectious diseases."
7390,"Maybe, maybe it's for Tamiflu, but for colds, who the hell is bothering to go to the pharmacy?"
7391,"What I'm saying is, if you are concerned, you'd better he concerned about a lot more places than the pharmacy and ER."
7392,You'd better be just as concerned about Walmart and the grocery store and wherever you work.
7393,"It makes sense...like what was with all the effort to get vaccinated to get out of things being shut down, people losing jobs, etc if we we did it all and still need lockdowns?"
7394,Almost like fuck it.
7395,Freedom or death bitches.
7396,"No turning back now, no one gives a fuck."
7397,Please stop with this.
7398,Death is pretty permanent and non temporary.
7399,"The clotting nearly killed me, personally, had I not been educated enough on the symptoms I was having and wtf to do."
7400,And despite being immunocompromised I was an insanely healthy individual before receiving the vaccine.
7401,I’ll also never even fully recover as I have permanent disfigurement from the surgeries the vaccine caused me to have.
7402,"The average person with truly no medical conditions should be getting it to help towards herd immunity, but please do not downplay the side effects and downplay that there is higher rate of severe side effects in some communities that should be having some hesitancy in general due to very real issues that arise more frequently."
7403,Can't do combat sports.
7404,It was in reference to that.
7405,"Now if only we could find someone to handle ""Deez"" we'd be all set."
7406,_God Fucking Damnit_
7407,"If only there had been someone studying the problem of vaccine hesitancy for years, and published the results of these studies, somewhere any policy makers could find them."
7408,Like a [health organization of some world-level specialty](https://www.who.int/immunization/sage/meetings/2014/october/3_SAGE_WG_Strategies_addressing_vaccine_hesitancy_2014.pdf).
7409,"I apologize for the flippant response, but this is not a new problem, merely one with a new level of urgency."
7410,we might as well get used to it.
7411,lockdown from extreme heat waves is becoming a thing we will normally have to do.
7412,r/coronavirus moment
7413,"From the paper that the article was based on, "" However, by contrast with the immunosenescence observed after influenza  infection in the elderly, multivariable analysis indicated that age andseverity of illness were independently associated with increasedantibody titers."
7414,"These findings call for enhanced surveillance ofCOVID-19 mass vaccination programs."""
7415,What does this mean?

7427,I think the main concern here is if vaccinated people can transmit the delta variant.
7428,"That would not be good news for the goal of suppressing cases, which the unvaccinated are knowingly or unknowingly depending on, and for the risk of future variants."
7429,"Also, probably a smaller concern is if these vaccinated infected people can develop long Covid."
7430,They should considering almost all of them are misinformation/misrepresentations of data.
7431,Many also push an anti-vax narrative.
7432,I think the mods can’t be bothered anymore.
7433,"Yeah, a good amount of the US population won't do it just because it of it being mandated."
7434,We have a little oppositional defiance issue here.
7435,"Your secretary might be an idiot, but you’re vaccinated, you’ll be fine."
7436,"Question about the J&amp;J vaccine, I’ve seen it hits some people hard with the side effects but is there data on how it hits older people specifically?"
7437,Asking for some family members wanting to get that one since it’s 1 dose but being hesitant because of the side effects.
7438,Thank you.
7439,We (the vaxxed) were never fully “safe”.
7440,"The vaccine significantly reduces, but does not eliminate, our susceptibility to catching covid."
7441,It greatly reduces the risk of hospitalization and almost fully eliminates the risk of death.
7442,Breakthrough infections are not unexpected…
7443,But the CDC is not a body of law because there are other considerations outside of science.
7444,Which is why the decision is left to the people in charge of policy.
7445,"Either way as the guy said above the WHO makes recommendations for the world, CDC is for the US."
7446,And the US has a great vaccine response using vaccines which provide better protection against the variant you’re so worried about.
7447,"If you’re worried, stay home."
7448,You mean people who don’t want their businesses to be closed for two years and can’t WFH like yuppies on reddit?
7449,Yeah not happening
7450,Stop.
7451,"Yup, these are all the big ones."
7452,"It fucked up my wife’s blood flow and caused her to bruise all over her body for about a month and it caused me to clot behind old scar tissue, which then hemorrhaged causing me to lose ~1/2 the blood in my body and require emergency surgery."
7453,"I can’t even sue the vaccine maker as they’re protected, which is insane."
7454,I nearly *died* from this shit and got to spend weeks in the hospital and in recovery *and* get to have a second surgery now too.
7455,Two completely unnecessary surgeries as a result of this one vaccine.
7456,I can’t even enjoy being vaccinated as I’m stuck inside still between surgery recovery and needing to stay away from others as an immunocompromised individual with the delta variant on the rise around me and venues allowing unvaccinated people in as well.
7457,I have 4 non-immunocompromised friends that all had the same vaccine as me become COVID positive over the last few weeks all while fully vaccinated.
7458,"To me that just screams even louder to me, “Wtf was the point?” I get to suffer and then get all of like 4-8 months of my vaccine potentially still having efficacy, but most likely won’t."
7459,"And no, I’m not saying the average person shouldn’t be getting vaccinated, it’s the exact opposite as they’re much *less* likely to have side effects and we need herd immunity, but so little research and care was done in the rollout of these that many individuals, mainly, immunocompromised ones, should be told to be hesitant and should have been the *last* to receive doses as they’re by and large the ones having the most issues."
7460,I have very little hope left in humanity.
7461,Can’t blame them
7462,"Yes, exactly."
7463,I think people are heavily invested in believing that vaccines create some kind of magic bubble around you that will prevent anything bad from ever happening to you.
7464,"There's nothing wrong with wanting this to be true, but if we start making plans on that basis, there's going to be a crash."
7465,"Certainly the human immune system can be effective at purging pathogens from the body, and certainly vaccines can be a great way to stimulate that ability."
7466,But I don't think anything about this is a hundred percent effective (and the effectiveness of a Coronavirus vaccination likely drops as time passes).
7467,"Societies are different, people are different, vaccines are different, and COVID viral variants are different."
7468,"Add all this up, and you get something that, while still very worthwhile, is going to have holes in it."
7469,There is somewhere between blind pessimism and blind optimism that is where we need to be.
7470,"Yeah, other countries generally just don't want felons in their country."
7471,Some block you from even taking vacation in their country.
7472,Regardless of what the felony charge is.
7473,Exactly.
7474,"The vaccines are incredibly effective against protecting against hospitalization and death against Delta, just like every other variant."
7475,"Sure, with Delta the vaccines offer less technical effectiveness against contracting it (which all these fear mongering articles state)... but the vaccine prevents you from getting seriously ill from it."
7476,Who gives a shit if you technically catch it but are asymptomatic or are mildly sick for a few days?
7477,"We want to prevent the bad outcomes from COVID - hospitalization and death - which the vaccines are remarkably effective at doing with all variants, including Delta."
7478,Are the mods not doing anything to clamp down on doomeresque posts?
7479,They need to
7480,"&gt; Follow all the rules for over a year

Well not everyone followed all the rules, if everyone did and everyone got vaccinated when they could we would be in a lot better place."
7481,The anti-vaxers/maskers and non-rule followers really screwed everyone by furthering the spread and contributing to the creation of new variants.
7482,I can’t take this shit anymore!!!
7483,I just want my fucking life back.
7484,"I know it’s not the WHO’s fault, mutations happen, and adjustments have to be made when faced with new circumstances."
7485,But fuck man… I’m exhausted.
7486,"It's nothing new, covid vaccine have bee widely available for like 2 months now in the US."
7487,I do agree if they are not being used the stockpile should be donated.
7488,Make enough available for the few vaccine hesitant who change their mind but I highly doubt many of the vaccine hostile will change their minds.
7489,No.
7490,We didn’t have two years of lockdown and mask wearing anywhere in the US if that is where you are from.
7491,Not sure why you think this would be worse since we have extraordinarily effective vaccines.
7492,"The initial lockdowns, in the few places in the US that had lockdowns, we’re early on when we had no established treatment or vaccines."
7493,Places with low vaccination rates are going to see cases and deaths.
7494,I doubt that will be enough for lockdown.
7495,"Even if an outbreak was enough for a lockdown, the places with low vaccination rates are the places least likely to enforce restrictions."
7496,So don’t worry.
7497,At this point I'm in the same boat.
7498,I've done everything I was asked to.
7499,I called off plans and in-person events with loved ones.
7500,I stopped going to crowded areas.
7501,I wore masks every time I went into an indoor public place.
7502,I got vaccinated the second I was able to.
7503,I advocated for every reasonable safety measure over the past 16 months.
7504,I'm tired of trying to protect people who clearly don't want to be protected.
7505,You have to remember that vaccines do not build a physical barrier to block the virus.
7506,"If you breathe in some virus particles, shove a cotton swab up there, and test it for virus particles, it's going to turn up positive."
7507,"The difference is, if you're vaccinated, your immune system is able to prevent the virus from infecting your body, or at least keep enough of the virus out that if some do get in, they cause mild symptoms."

7515,In that case I don’t expect us to return to old ways ever.

7594,there was also another getting infected sitting outside in a cafe from someone visiting the store.
7595,recently read a UK gov statement quoting numbers for the various vaccines .. which showed resistance to Delta much less than other variants.
7596,But what happens to those in the UK that have received from SII?
7597,"Is it just gonna be a case of tough, you received your dose in March so can't come."
7598,No.
7599,But that dont sell.

7619,"it still kills vaccinated people, though."
7620,"A much lower proportion of vaccinated people, granted, but it does."
7621,"Currently, about half the people dying in the UK were vaccinated."
7622,"Which is not a knock on the vaccines, it's just that a lot of Brits are vaccinated, and the virus is infecting a lot of them right now."
7623,"the other problem is that allowing the virus to spread also gives it more breathing room to mutate, and if new variants keep popping up it'll take much longer until vaccines can eventually get it under control for good."
7624,Exactly.
7625,"Although it may not be a winning long-term strategy, SARS-CoV-2 could be 2x, 5x, even 10x as deadly, and it wouldn't really be affected by it."

Get sick from COVID-19

Spread COVID-19 to others

CDC recommends everyone 12 years and older should get a COVID-19 vaccination to help protect against COVID-19."

7734,"1st dose efficacy is something like 50-60% after two weeks, and I feel confident with that level of protection, that either I won't be infected or I'll be infected less severely, and being fairly healthy otherwise, I've never been afraid of being infected naturally in the first place."
7735,"I'm still holding out for some tiny level of natural immunity if its at all possible, but even if I only have vaccine immunity, I feel pretty okay with that."
7736,"This efficacy is comparable to the efficacy of other vaccines, like varicella after all these years- I'm only that much protected, too."

7910,It’s not going to happen.
7911,You seem very fragile with your need to persuade.
7912,A strong man stands with his convictions silently.
7913,You should try it.
7914,"Edited to add: children dont have a natural immunity, they have fewer ACE2 pathways."
7915,If you’re going to regurgitate misinformation at least know what you’re saying.
7916,I find it interesting that SF is pushing for mandatory vaccination.
7917,The city offers quite a bit if freedom of choice to many inhabitants.
7918,"Not that I disagree with the requirements, but it definitely is against the sf grain."
7919,"The WHO, I imagine, is more worried about vaccines for anybody."

7921,Hey me too
7922,"Yeah, the people not getting vaccinated right now are fucking nuts."
7923,"Side note isn't it crazy we're talking about ""only"" 88 percent?"
7924,It’s only 88% effective against the Delta variant.
7925,So if 25 vaccinated individuals were introduced to the Delta variant 3 of them would likely test positive.
7926,Whereas those without a vaccine have no protection at all and are extreme likely to contract the Delta variant.
7927,I’m hearing symptoms are worse or more aggressive than earlier strains of Covid.
7928,"Continuing to wear a mask around others, sanitizing surfaces, and habitually washing your hands is still a very good idea."
7929,Vaccination is the best way to fight variants from mutating.
7930,The unvaccinated will eventually see higher and higher death-tolls.
7931,no shit.

7945,"get vaccinated, wear masks, and be isolated while those fucking morons party like nothing odd is going on?"
7946,I get your point but it's not fair for us that are being responsible...
7947,Lucky you .My arm ached like mike Tyson in his prime had taken a bite off it.
7948,Lots of insurances already take this stuff into account.
7949,"Try to get disability insurance with real medical problems like MS, etc."
7950,You almost can't unless you are rich.
7951,People should have the right to wether they wear a mask or not.
7952,Why would anyone ever pass on that?
7953,"If you have to wear a mask because you have a weak immune system, or simply because you want to hide your face, maybe you have allergies and you feel it helps, maybe because they keep your face warm."
7954,These are all wonderful reasons for wearing a mask.
7955,"I fully respect your decision, but let’s not forget that should be a TWO WAY STREET."
7956,"You can end up with something called parosmia, which is a complete distortion of smell."
7957,"For me things like chicken, onions, garlic, fried food, beans smell and taste like vomit."
7958,"I had covid back in January and lost my sense of smell completely, got it back in February and, this is the weird thing, developed parosmia after my second Moderna shot on April 18th."
7959,"Some people say that usually you develop it around 2-3 months after having covid, but I still believe the spike protein from the shot had something to do with it."
7960,"It's been pretty good for the last 8 months, but we totally buggered the vaccine rollout and are absolutely shite at handling quarantine which is not a good combo."
7961,I took my niece to get covid shot.
7962,(covishield dose 1) Shes 19.
7963,Her mom went to the police.
7964,It's India.
7965,So you can imagine the shit show.
7966,She showed the receipt you get for vaccination and I was let go after hours of harassment.
7967,I thought I would loose my job but my boss congratulated me.
7968,Someone had told her mom that her daughter won't be able to get pregnant if she took the shots.
7969,Before you ask.. she had already expressed her interest in getting vaccinated.
7970,That's why they had took away her cell phone and stopped her pocket money.
7971,By they i mean her mom.
7972,She went to get shots with me when her parents were Not at home.
7973,Her mom at work and her dad 'reading' at the local library.
7974,All in all it was an eye opening experience.
7975,Now I'm dreading the day when she really gets married and maybe fails to give grandchildren.
7976,It can happen.
7977,Nothing in life is guaranteed.
7978,Then her mom would come after me again.
7979,Lol
7980,I was replying to someone who was primarily concerned about pharmacies and ERs which is ludicrous.
7981,"Look how much spread occurs at work, places or worship, weddings, etc."
7982,"Do you really think 400,000 cases a day were mostly from pharmacies and ERs?"
7983,I'm not going to go hunt for the data backing this up because it's too damn obvious to bother with.
7984,Proof positive that the vaccines work.
7985,Although we do have to be careful of Delta.
7986,Yeah.
7987,I don't have those complaints.
7988,But that's just me.
7989,Bye!
7990,"I see this Darwin joke all the time on this sub, and I’m really not the biggest fan."
7991,"Realistically, the vast majority of people who catch Covid will not die from it."
7992,"The IFR is something like &lt;1%, and much lower for the subset of people (young folks) who have the lowest vaccine uptake."
7993,We have to be honest with folks about the risks.
7994,"Yes, you probably won’t die from Covid."
7995,But get the vaccine to protect grandma.
7996,Do it to avoid a real risk of long term effects.
7997,And — though you probably won’t die from Covid — it’s a nearly free way to eliminate the risk.
7998,I worry that by overstating the risk (which the Darwin joke kinda implicitly does) we just get some vaccine skeptical people who we need to reach to completely tune us out
7999,If FOXNEWs talent became advocates for vaccination that would go a long way toward helping to close this gap.
8000,"Or even just avoiding ""Fear Uncertainty and Doubt"" reporting on the topic would help some."
8001,Well they do slow it down but something like covid seems to have all the time and potential carriers it wants
8002,"I have a medically at-risk kid, so we are living the same as we have since April 2020 until they can be vaccinated."
8003,[removed]
8004,Oh yeah.
8005,So this is obviously with the assumption that both the set of population is same i.e 50% were vaccinated and 50% not.
8006,I was just trying to define 95% efficacy.
8007,Covid is endemic now.
8008,"It will be here for the rest of our lives, just like the flu, common cold, etc."
8009,We have highly effective vaccines that can combat the virus.
8010,It is readily available to anyone who wants it in many parts of the world and continues to be rolled out in other places as well.
8011,"We now have two options: wear masks forever, lockdown, close down or heavily restrict businesses forevermore, and live in fear OR return to our normal lives."
8012,The choice is yours.
8013,I choose the latter.
8014,The science you speak of is settled.
8015,The choice of whether or not to return to normal life IS yours.
8016,This truly ends when you decide it does.
8017,I have decided already and my life has returned to full normal.
8018,"I go out to eat, I haven’t worn a mask in over a month, I spend time and have hugged loved ones."

8021,You’re welcome to continue living in a way that best works for you.
8022,"But for me and the part of the world I live in, Covid-19 is over and I don’t care what the WHO says, I’m NOT going back to living the way I have for the last 16 months."
8023,Medical care in Cuba is pretty widely understood as meeting first world standards.
8024,I would not be surprised if these results are borne out in additional studies.
8025,"There is evidence coming out of Australia that seems to show transmission of Delta variant can happen in mere seconds, from just walking past someone."
8026,"So yes, places like grocery stores should definitely require masks if that’s the case."

8035,"I’m just going to throw this out there - I thought I was having fatigue related to covid, months after."
8036,"Turns out, I was vitamin D deficient."
8037,I don’t if covid effected that or not.

8048,The more Washington gets involved the more reluctant people will be.

8052,"People don’t want to work when they can mooch off the system, which means they don’t need to get vaccinated."
8053,Covid infects differently than other viruses (via the ACE2 receptor).
8054,"The symptoms might be the same or similar, but the areas of the brain that are affected, and the causes will be different."
8055,"For example, there was one study earlier on that [found megakaryocytes, aka Bone Marrow Cells, in brains of COVID patients post-mortem](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/945774#:~:text=The%20long%2Dterm%20neurologic%20symptoms,cells%2C%20a%20new%20report%20suggests.)"

8063,Because they are trying to prevent the inevitable
8064,The places with low vaccination rates are also mostly the places that had much lower mask adherence in the first place.
8065,Reinstating mask requirements is going to be extremely unlikely at this point.
8066,She’s a pediatric dentist.
8067,Seems to me the government is all up in what she can do and what she can’t do.
8068,These folks are nuts.
8069,&gt; The only quick and realistic way is to bring back mask mandates in some cases like grocery stores.
8070,"Is there any actual evidence that outbreaks are being driven by brief interactions in stores, though?"
8071,"I am all for requiring masks at certain businesses (like grocery stores), but it seems likely the effect will be marginal."
8072,We know (from contact tracing) that bars and restaurants were major contributors to the spread.
8073,"But would it be right for us to close those down, ruining many lives, to mainly help people who refuse to help themselves?"
8074,"As long as hospital capacity is not threatened, I am against new restrictions (beyond limited mandated masking, which--who cares?)."
8075,We have N95s that are readily available for people who cannot get vaccinated or for whom the vaccine might not work.
8076,&gt; All this sarcastic talk about people needing to be vaccinated is getting old.
8077,Yes that’s clearly the best solution but is it going to happen?
8078,I would *much* prefer vaccine passports and/or mandates to blanket restrictions that affect the vaccinated.
8079,"You can see a clear trend though of variants becoming slightly more infectious, slightly more transmissible, and slightly better at defeating vaccination."

8099,"So yeah 99 people vaccinated are ""sick"" with the virus but they are all asymptomatic I'm guessing."

8121,"I spent 15-6 years on Korea, and I've got to hear and read what my fellow Koreans say about Japanese and especially, Chinese - the rivalry (or dislike if I dare say) was so ingrained in the society that it really doesn't bother people whenever some say pretty racist things (especially after the hard right turn in Japanese politics in 2000s)."
8122,It's also reflected in systemic racism.
8123,"Did you know 50 Koreans applied for one Japanese college, and every one of them got rejected?"
8124,But they are less racist than America and other western countries in way that they don't physically threat you.

8248,"Awesome post, thank you for this!"
8249,"My point isn't that we aren't part of the planet, nor that these variants are not dangerous... just that advice that would apply to a country with very low rates of vaccination may not also apply to a country with relatively high vaccination rates."
8250,The WHO has to tailor it's advice to account for countries with &lt;1% vaccination AND countries with &gt;50% vaccinated because it's a global organization.
8251,"I would say listen to the CDC and state/local health departments for advice on how to proceed in the USA, because they are more specific to the situation in this country and more specific to certain regions of the country (because vaccine uptake is pretty variable depending on where in the USA you are located)."
8252,"So, masks may be needed again at some point in Alabama but maybe not in Vermont because of % vaccinated (just as a random example, I'm not pointing fingers at those particular places)."
8253,[deleted]
8254,See this is what is going to happen.
8255,"In Ontario we are going to be below 200 cases daily soon (our peak was 4300 in April)

So if we get say a 50 case increase due to an outbreak, the headlines will read COVID SURGES 50%!!!"
8256,"50% of a VERY small number, but the headlines will grab people."
8257,Good pointing that out.
8258,Just being mRNA is not enough on its own to be good.
8259,But my point is that Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna are arguably the best vaccines against covid that currently exist.
8260,"Not really, some of us have strong digital security on those."
8261,"You can repeat ""the vaccines are highly effective"" over and over, it doesn't change the fact that barely more than half the US population has been even ""half"" vaccinated."

8270,That's what I thought it was
8271,Yeah no.
8272,Fuck that.
8273,Thank you
8274,Especially since people are unwilling to take basic precautions or experience minor inconvenience.
8275,My guess is they phrased it that way because it's a discrepancy between the vaccination rates in the South(and some Midwestern states) and other more vaccinated areas of the country.
8276,"Not even choosing the extreme opposites, like Vermont and Mississippi, which have a 35% difference in fully vaccinated population, there's definitely a bit of a difference."
8277,"Even between California(~49% fully vaccinated) and Georgia(~35%), that's a big gap."
8278,And the gap is even more noticeable when you look at the single doses distributed.
8279,"60% of California is at least partially vaccinated, versus 42% of Georgia."
8280,"And the concerning thing is that the vaccination distribution is very divided by 2020 party lines, with some exceptions."
8281,"That tells me that it's very unlikely an FDA approval will sway a significant number of people in those states, whereas it might bring the numbers up a bit in the other states."
8282,"If Trump and family getting the shot didn't persuade them, it's kind of scary because it feels like nothing will."

8296,"PVF isn't even a one size issue, not everyone with it is crippled, in most cases people recover in time."
8297,We run a risk of permitting Governments to neglect people with severe PVF as a result of other viral infections.
8298,"I think, from an epidemiological standpoint (and I could be wrong), that if the virus were more deadly (like ebola for instance), it wouldn't have been as widespread."
8299,"The fact that COVID only kills about 1% of the people infects is, I believe, a large part of the reason it was able to spread all throughout the world."

8321,I hope everyone is more hygienic and respecting of personal space coming out of this pandemic.
8322,Sputnik turns out is doing well against the variants.
8323,It is just that 90% of Russia are hesitant to get vaxxed.
8324,They mean [cases](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/06/20/us-coronavirus-infection-rate-fall-2021/).
8325,"I am not sure why the prediction is such a low number; it might be that our peak last winter was so large, it might be that they think that infections won't begin to take off until we can vaccinate kids, or it might have something to with the uneven vaccine distribution mentioned above."
8326,That said: it's a model and of course it can be wrong.
8327,"The important thing is that if you are vaccinated, you are very well protected."
8328,We should all be trying to convince everyone we know who isn't vaccinated to get the shots ASAP so that they don't die or pass the disease on to someone who would like to be vaccinated but cannot be.
8329,"If I had to guess, considering I’m not an expert and really don’t know anything."
8330,"I’d guess vaccines last longer because of the sheer amount of spike proteins, but natural infection might be broader due to your body having antibodies to other parts of the virus besides the spike protein."
8331,Maybe having both is the best
8332,Their sentence structure is ambiguous to me.
8333,"""Give us Pfizer, or we are not going to vaccinate at all))""

I hate this shit so much - from educated people who should know better."
8334,"The government always send mixed signals, they've created the reasons why people don't trust them, but really people should know better."
8335,"Sputnik is a perfectly fine vaccine, it's widely deployed all over the world, it was tested not only by Russia, it's safe and efficient against both the original and Delta (the developers claim ~85% efficiency against Delta)."
8336,"Maybe it's not as good as Holy Pfizer, but it's still much better than being non-vaccinated at all."
8337,It's entirely irrational.
8338,Some are in search for Kovivac vaccine - another Russian vaccine.
8339,"While it has far fewer research on it than Sputnik, just because its scarcity, many believe it's better."
8340,You should tell the virus to stop mutating instead
8341,"In the UK and Israel, more than 80% of adults are vaccinated."
8342,Aaaaaand you fell for it...
8343,You looking for praise or something?
8344,"I’m vaccinated, don’t need one anymore."
8345,If people don’t wanna get the vaccines that are readily available then that’s not my problem.
8346,My mom is a boomer and vehemently antivax.
8347,I got my first dose on Friday and told my mom yesterday and she quit talking to me 😂.
8348,"Username checks out, I guess."
8349,Pay people to vaccinate their kids once kids can get it.
8350,"They're all linked - we sequence the genome of every single case we can in Australia, and have for many months now."
8351,"This aids contact tracing considerably, as when you get two separate cases you can confirm that they're both closely related."
8352,Combine that with an epidemiological link (visited a hair salon with an infected worker) and there's virtually no way it came from elsewhere.
8353,Covid genuinely hasn't been circulating in Australia outside of these rare outbreaks.
8354,"I agree, it’s a tricky issue."
8355,"The government could consider incentivizing and rewarding people who get the vaccine and withholding from people who dont, like requiring it for air travel, boat travel, receiving reimbursement for government funded services, etc."
8356,This isn’t completely true.
8357,"Some variants do show reduced vaccine effectiveness (especially after only one dose of a two dose regimen), but none evade vaccine immunity entirely."
8358,"I agree that this will be ignored, but seems bizarre to blame the WHO for ""moving the goalpost."""
8359,It's a new variant.
8360,A thing changed.
8361,"Wouldn't it be weird if they were like ""well, circumstances are different, but we already declared our COVID plan a year ago and we can't just update it""?"
8362,Must be nice.
8363,In Ontario we will be 80% fully vaccinated and still having to wear them.
8364,Agreed.
8365,"And yea, from what I've been reading, immunity seems to last about the same for both natural infection and vaccine."

8378,Saw this in npr as well.
8379,"This is in line with my speculation when after vaccines became available in MN, we starting getting them, and then the CDC was so quick to make a statement that vaccinated people are safe indoors with others who are."
8380,The governor soon after stated ending state-level mask mandates in June (70% vaccinated or not).
8381,I was puzzled as there were no statements indicating how exactly the vaccine would protect you or if you could still spread the virus being vaccinated.
8382,"The truth is the vaccine didn't mean 'you're good now and the pandemic is over', it was simply a massive tool to work toward ending the pandemic."
8383,"The reality is that we can still get ill after being vaccinated, but have a high probability of not being hospitalized or dying."
8384,We also learned later it limits the chances of transmission most-likey.
8385,Far before those facts were actually learned and digested we had politicians removing mandates and guidelines as to just 'move on'.
8386,That is a little alarming IMO.
8387,At this point I will pay more attention to World News.
8388,[removed]
8389,[removed]
8390,The overall message from UK and Israel is pretty positive in that the vaccines are about 80 percent effective after both doses.
8391,For Israel this may mean that they need to get kids vaccinated before they can lift the mask mandate.
8392,It is important to prevent sustained transmission of a variant (eg case load of thousands that continue to spread through vaccinated individuals) because this will produce strong pressure for increased immune escape.
8393,"If we see this happening then something will need to be done — a booster shot, indoor mask mandate, something."
8394,"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/burden.html

8402,"They can still die, too."
8403,And infect people around them.

8405,This isn't a difficult concept to grasp.

8408,"I'm a little older than a teen, I just got done with my second year of college, but towards the end of it I got vaccinated so I could keep my qanon cultist grandparents and aunt safe since I work retail."

8410,Thanks guys lol
8411,I still wear a mask when I go into stores.
8412,A mask doesn’t bother me.
8413,I’m fully vaccinated and at this point I don’t care what others do.

8464,"Then there's the miner in NT who caught it in Brisbane quarantine from another traveller and spread it through the mine, with hundreds of workers now spread across Australia."
8465,So three different sources.
8466,"Delta variant has an R0 of 5 to 7, so a single case can become hundreds in just a couple weeks."
8467,That’s a fair point and is definitely a good argument for specifically healthcare workers to get the shot regardless of previous infection.
8468,Good news about natural immunity is that it seems to be as effective as vaccines at preventing COVID.
8469,Obviously nobody can know how long it lasts but I’m hoping for good news on that front and for the vaccine

8654,So far no problems.
8655,The report I saw and I think it was in the NYT referred to a number of doctors about 60 if I remember correctly that contracted covid after being fully vaccinated with  Sinovax and I believe they stated 10 died.

8659,I'm really sorry.
8660,I hope you'll be better soon!
8661,"Plus, it's very misleading since case numbers are dependent on how much people are testing."
8662,I know for a fact that tests are more widely available now then they were near the beginning of the pandemic.
8663,So a case count of 20 today is actually much lower than a case count of 20 a year ago.
8664,"Well, we’ll have to see what happens, I suppose."

8734,Bottom line: we don’t really have enough data to fully understand delta and it’s risks yet.
8735,"Here are some result research results regarding Pfizer efficacy in the delta variant:

“Delta, first identified in India: Real-world data shows vaccines are highly effective against this variant."
8736,"In a recent analysis of 19,543 people in Scotland, Pfizer's vaccine was 79 percent effective in preventing infection from the delta variant."
8737,Research from Public Health England suggests protection may be even higher.

8743,"The Delta variant already has another variant from it (Delta +), regardless the situation with the original Delta variant, we are leaning ever closer to the vaccine not being effective due to how viruses mutate and unfortunately the disease is getting both more dangerous and faster spreading then what was dealt with in the last year and a half."

8813,"&gt;science on the things you mentioned is either settled or still be investigated

So it's both known and unknown."
8814,That settles it.
8815,"It's really hard to say, but seems likely."
8816,I also think that comparing covid to flu is sort of a hopeless comparison.
8817,"Flu is more dangerous for children ~ 16 and younger, while covid is more dangerous for everyone else."
8818,"The biggest difference however is that covid is probably around 5-6x more contagious/infectious than the flu is, so even in the younger ages covid is going to kill more people because it's just going to infect more."
8819,"Also, covid is sort of a weird disease in that the initial strain was relatively mild compared to others in a similar profile (SARS, MERS, etc) but it was waaaaay more contagious."
8820,"This lead me to believe last June when I was thinking about it, that covid was likely to evolve to be more dangerous/deadly rather than evolving to be less dangerous/deadly like many diseases do."
8821,"The reason being that most diseases that are deadly, start out too deadly to people, and it causes the disease to die out too quickly."
8822,"For covid however, that is already airborne, the limiting factor in spreading is actually how sick it makes people since even though it can spread from asymptomatic individuals it does not spread nearly as well as those who get sick and cough/sneeze/etc."
8823,"This was, and is, still my biggest reason against opening up schools for in-person classes until there is a vaccine available for the age groups."
8824,"If your biggest vector for the virus is a population that was relatively insulated previously (in this case, young kids) becomes the only reliable, wide-spread transmission vector, then the virus is going to evolve such that the strains that spread most efficiently in that group are the ones that will take dominance and spread."
8825,It's an insanely stupid thing to do because it's going to put a bunch of kids at risk.
8826,"It's entirely possible we get the vaccine rolled out before it becomes seriously dangerous for the younger age groups, but why take that bet when losing it has such serious consequences."
8827,😂😂
8828,"Yeah israel is fucked, averaging 0 deaths per day."
8829,"Yes, and it has been taken into account, admissions and deaths are lower than this point during previous waves, although the first wave is only modelled due to lack of testing."
8830,"I take it you aren’t a very knowledgeable person 

So, heres a Sky News article, which should be easy enough for a even the least aware individuals to understand, for you to read through

8835,"Asian countries still get bad flu seasons 

Mask do help"
8836,The data the CDC and WHO are sharing is the 'facts'.
8837,"You might want to evaluate the numbers in Israel and the UK, two of the most vaccinated nations on Earth, before declaring 'all the numbers are going down'."
8838,Have you been checked for like a deviated septum?
8839,I made it mid 30s before anyone freaking told me about it and I had all the symptoms.

8841,"4k smells

Or you just burnt tf out of your nose and you can ignore me ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
8842,I definitely know and I'm sorry your deserved break got cut short.
8843,"We're(in Ohio) pretty untouched by delta so far, so I've enjoyed being able to take my mask off with relative safety and such."
8844,"Although I only do that when it's not crowded somewhere, I still get complete anxiety in a crowded room and I don't think that's going away anytime soon."
8845,"Although I'm ready to go back to hardcore safety precautions when Delta starts it's rise here, and if it gets really bad again."
8846,I'm just holding a tiny hope out that it doesn't.
8847,Go home you’re drunk
8848,"The variants, *all known variants*do not pose a challenge to vaccines."
8849,There is *a lot* of data on this.
8850,"Ignoring that, like you are, is foolish."
8851,Yes I know.
8852,I don’t know if I’ve ever seen a number of samples sequenced by NYC.
8853,I’m sure it’s small but it’s most likely the same number of samples every week.
8854,"Better yet, stay strapped yourself."

8859,Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) if you have any questions or concerns.
8860,*
8861,SOME PEOPLE WEARING SEATBELTS MAY STILL BE INJURED IN CAR WRECKS - NTSA WARNS.
8862,How am I misrepresenting?
8863,"Which exact sentence is a misrepresentation of what the scientist said, and what is the correct wording?"
8864,"The article upon which this entire thread is based, is that a misrepresentation of the truth as well?"
8865,Is your truth that the pandemic is over?
8866,"We have vaccines, so everything is rosy?"
8867,Ignore the variants?
8868,Is that your position?
8869,The odds of it mutating into something that can invalidate the vaccine is about as likely as an entirely new pathogen showing up.
8870,"The vaccines are very effective, covid only has so many ways of entering the cell."
8871,"It's not wearing a mask specifically that bothers people, it's the social activities that really make no sense with masks on, which people are just getting back into the swing of here."
8872,"No dancing, no music shows, no meeting strangers."
8873,I guess you could require masks at bars or concerts but that sounds about as effective as the mask mandates for indoor dining.
8874,You're going to be taking them off to drink/eat as a matter of course.
8875,It's theater.
8876,The same comment without the last sentence literally sounds like an anti-vaxxer.
8877,Antibodies are relatively short lived.
8878,"We should be testing people for specific T cells, which are a more robust long term form of immunity that then help B cells pump out antibodies whenever an antigen is encountered."
8879,A lot of the newer research coming out on COVID immunity is focusing more and more on T cells rather than antibodies.
8880,Oh shit here we go again
8881,Didn’t sinovac protect the majority of health workers from the delta variant tho?
8882,The Indonesia article mentioned that there were over 6k vaccinated with sinovac exposed and only 300 and something got sick and almost all of them are back to work by now or something like that.
8883,I'm just explaining why it matters.
8884,I know not everyone is good at math.
8885,"I wouldn't recommend it, personally, but some people can still get pretty far with just their grade 10."
8886,I would agree with that about that initial situation.
8887,"However, the situation is now different."
8888,There are highly efficacious vaccines.
8889,"The global disparity in availability is unfair and unfortunate but it is also reality, in that the USA is way more vaccinated than, say, places in Africa."
8890,"As such the requirements for mitigation are going to vary by region, which was not the case when there were no vaccines or effective treatments for Covid."
8891,"Crossing my fingers that I'll be able to go to Austria in September (they just announced they're open to vaxxed Americans, but we'll see if that changes because of delta)."
8892,But their guidelines are that it has to have been less than 9 months since being fully vaccinated.
8893,They're not the only country I've seen with this 9 month rule.
8894,I got my doses in March so I'm good in September.
8895,But I'm thinking beyond that....what happens after 9 months?
8896,All of us fully vaxxed individuals suddenly become persona non grata?
8897,"I understand that boosters *may* be necessary, but until boosters actually become available, this 9 month thing surely has to change, right?"
8898,Two weeks ago the UK SAGE estimate was the peak of this current wave wouldn't exceed 20% of the peak of their first winter wave in Nov and Dec.
8899,They've blown well past that estimate.
8900,No.
8901,I don't think I will.
8902,I've never had experience of the system: what prevents you moving or traveling?
8903,Can you not get a passport?
8904,Or is it because of immigration rules in your target country?
8905,So you share mine and and Bill Burr's take on this.
8906,One of  us!
8907,One of us!
8908,They base their laws on what the CDC says
8909,"Little has been talked about the risk of getting other people (family, friends, close contacts, etc.)"
8910,sick even when vaccinated.
8911,I did some digging this morning on the topic.
8912,"In a recent study from England (pre-Delta) that tracked secondary attack rates (if you get sick, how many people you spread it to), they found that receiving at least one dose reduces your risk for getting someone else sick by 50% - 60%:

&gt;Among over 550,000 residential households in the UK between January to March 2021, the overall SARS-CoV-2 secondary attack rate was 5.7% in household where the index case had received at least one dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca and 6.3% in households where the index case had received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine more than 21 days before testing positive."
8913,"By contrast, the overall secondary attack rate in households with unvaccinated index cases was 10%

https://depts.washington.edu/pandemicalliance/2021/04/29/impact-of-vaccination-on-household-transmission-of-sars-cov-2-in-england/

This is good information to know as people decide what risks they want to take in public or in family settings."
8914,"Especially, people with families with young children who cannot vaccinate."
8915,So you've gone from asking what the arguments against the vaccine are to telling people side effects aren't temporary?
8916,Put up or shut up.
8917,Show evidence or quit talking.
8918,cope
8919,I am so fucking tired of this shit.
8920,We will never get out of this pandemic with people who think like this.
8921,"Lol do you really think I'm referring to people who want it, but can't get it?"
8922,"I think it's clear that I'm talking about those who have had ample opportunity, but still refuse."
8923,In my country (US) a huge percentage of the population won't care until someone very close to them  gets intubated or dies.
8924,It is the only possible way to penetrate their misinformation bubble
8925,Evidence?
8926,Where are the peer reviewed studies suggesting this?
8927,The delta-plus variant has only one additional mutation from delta.
8928,Does WHO just pull this out of their ass?
8929,What other solution do you propose?
8930,I’m still waiting for it.
8931,The reporting is leaving out context in the name of generating clickbait and alarm.
8932,"Half of *adult* cases are in vaccinated adults, and are generally mild/asymptomatic."
8933,Only half the cases were in adults; the rest were largely in unvaccinated teens.
8934,Context here: https://twitter.com/ScottGottliebMD/status/1408861501306376199
8935,"If people wander around maskless, as if nothing is going on, then yes, maybe."
8936,"But otherwise with equal social distancing and masking, it wouldn't be worse than last wave imo, but...even 20% of peak...would be 50-75 thousand cases...per day....which would be....very bad, more than 5x worse than where we are now."
8937,"Also, Gottlieb tends to downplay things, and the model also usually has been lower than the actual cases and deaths, as they constantly adjust it for more deaths and cases later on when things get worse."
8938,"Maybe 25-35% of peak, but that was...the worst corona peak in the world besides India's recent so even half or 20% of that...would be extremely bad, and 50-75k per day...would be some of the worst numbers the world has seen...again."
8939,This thread isn't about covid.
8940,There are lots of viruses out there one could catch.
8941,And yes it's fucking idiotic to say places that are literally built for sick people aren't more likely to have sick people in them.
8942,"Oh I agree that vaccinated people should be able to go unmasked, I just think it should have been emphasized a lot more that unvaccinated people need to keep masking in public places or in mixed crowds."
8943,"But of course, there is no real way to monitor this, at least no way that Americans would accept, and companies just ripped down their mask signs and now it's a free-for-all."
8944,"I personally know unvaccinated people who have ditched their masks, because who's going to stop them?"
8945,Nobody.
8946,"There’s a wonderful thing called “data”

Example, 50% of infected in Israel are infected and fully vaccinated."
8947,"According to Public Health Services head Dr. Sharon Alroy-Preis, as of Wednesday night some 891 people had been diagnosed with coronavirus in the last month, 50% of whom were fully vaccinated."
8948,Health Ministry director-general Chezy Levy further clarified that the last 99 infected people over the age of 16 had been fully vaccinated and 39 had not.
8949,"Scott Gottlieb on that bit of news: https://twitter.com/jason_kint/status/1408894300675620865?s=21

Real world study from the lancet showing the Pfizer vaccine to have a 79% efficacy at preventing infection against *all* infection (both symptomatic infection) caused by Delta."
8950,"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)01358-1/fulltext?dgcid=raven_jbs_etoc_email

Latest PHE data showing protection against hospitalization being *higher* against Delta than Alpha, and efficacy against symptomatic infection being 79% *including both AZ (which has lower efficacy) and Pfizer/Moderna vaccines*

https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/996740/Variants_of_Concern_VOC_Technical_Briefing_17.pdf

Vaccine remain highly effective against Delta."
8951,"If you are vaccinated, it is not a concern for you."
8952,"This is the opinion of every reasonable public health expert as well, and it’s supported by robust data."
8953,It would be great if misinformation surrounding this would stop on this sub.
8954,"All you saw was the WHO making a reactionary decision based on extremely uneven distribution of vaccines worldwide, and Israel taking a precaution based on a very low amount of cases."
8955,I wish we wouldn’t have  adopted the negative term of “mandate”.
8956,It doesn’t help convince people of the right thing to do.
8957,it is.
8958,i’ve been following it everyday lately and people are really running out and getting a booster with zero official safety data because a person with a cat as their avatar told them to.
8959,Or having to obey all of the rules of the road.
8960,How dare they tell me I can only drive a certain speed or only one direction on the road.

8965,Oh my goodness I don't even know what to say to this!
8966,As a nurse I can tell you there's a lot of people who are not going to fall in line!
8967,"This will be great if it all went as you would like it to go but since we've already seen what the anti-vaxxers will do, having a new variant is not going to change anything."
8968,Delta has the worst severity of all the variants…
8969,"Abandoning half the population, plus whatever very small percentage of the vaccinated half get ill regardless, does not sound like good public policy."
8970,"Is the *only* other option the ""innovation capital of the world"" can come up with really forced vaccinations?"
8971,"Surgical masks are actually as good as n95's, they are called "" surgical"" for a reason."
8972,Novavax will be the best vaccine once it’s approved
8973,[removed]
8974,"Show us your peer-reviewed, Randomized Controlled Trial to support this claim."
8975,The bias in this specific matter is f**king astounding.
8976," And their just shows that it is important to keep transmission low, even after vaccination."
8977,"Yeah you're right, obviously."
8978,My comment was mostly just a joke.
8979,I guess I'm just waiting for the demand for Pfizer in the USA and Europe to die down so that they could start exporting it to other countries.
8980,"But ah well, it's not something that is in either of our control."
8981,"And if the Americans decide they need a third booster dose, I guess the rest of us will have to wait, no choice."
8982,We're gonna see bad outbreaks among dense people.
8983,"They're all variants of interest, rather then of concern."
8984,"In California, we have the joke that you can tell if someone is vaccinated based on whether they are wearing a mask or not."
8985,If someone doesn't wear a mask then they're likely unvaccinated.
8986,Good thing both of those are very effective vaccines at least!

9100,&gt;Maybe if the second shot didn’t make you feel like you got hit by a fucking train and then dropped from a 6 story window more people would get it.
9101,I’ve been feeling worse than I ever have in years since getting my second shot Friday evening.
9102,I understand.
9103,My moderna second was terrible.
9104,Sickest I've felt in a while.
9105,"But those symptoms, bad as they are, will be gone by tomorrow."
9106,Covid can ruin your life.
9107,My older sister used to be like that.
9108,Really hard core anti-vaxxer.
9109,Took her almost 20 years but she finally snapped out of it.
9110,I wish I knew what changed her mind but we aren't very close.
9111,Her daughter didn't know she hadn't been vaccinated til she was in her 20s then promptly went out &amp; got herself taken care of and got the COVID vaccine.
9112,"Anyway, I just relate."
9113,Before that my sister was one of those Y2K people who thought there would be mass hysteria bc computers.
9114,She bunkered down in the forest with tons of rice &amp; beans then called everyone in the family to say goodbye because she couldn't stand seeing everyone else not care.
9115,She really thought we were all gonna die.
9116,She said it was like being around dead people.
9117,I didn't get that call.
9118,Around 2003 she kinda wandered back as an anti-vaxxer.
9119,So... Yeah.
9120,When they get like that I don't think there's anything we can do.
9121,It's a really bizarre feeling being called a dead person.
9122,"In this particular case it's really, very sad because not getting the vaccine is so dangerous especially with that new delta strain."
9123,All empathy to you and your family.
9124,It must be awful.

9138,"We've been in the cusp of a pandemic for, well, a century now."
9139,"The only people we should hold accountable is the leadership in countries (like USA, Sweden) who actively did nothing while thousands of their citizens died."
9140,they have already vaccinated almost 24% (according to bloomberg) of their population with both of their local vaccines.

9143,"Sadly, we need to stop hoping for something that isn’t going to happen, and figure out how to minimize the damage otherwise."
9144,"On a related note, continuing to call people stupid isn’t going to minimize the damage."
9145,I don't understand your statement?
9146,"wearing a kn95 mask does both at the same time, it protects me and also it prevents spread from me."
9147,Maybe you were thinking about masks with valves but most places where mask requirement is taken seriously don't allow them in the first place.

* Moving indoor activities outside as much as possible (easier in the summer and in good weather)."
9153,* Working hard on improving the outdoor air exchange of indoor spaces for things which absolutely can't be moved outside (an HVAC problem that may be expensive and time-consuming to implement).
9154,"* Getting people to wear actual N95 or other hi-fi masks in close quarters, rather than things like surgical masks and cloth masks which don't do much."
9155,This would be my wish list.
9156,No this is actually really important I appreciate it.
9157,Years ago I went through a bout of depression and turns out I was severely vitamin D deficient.
9158,I take it daily now and recommend it to everyone who brings up feeling depressed
9159,My state has been consistent at least.
9160,No restrictions since March and we aint going back.
9161,It’s a few cases from the airport but those people infected large numbers of other people because they virus is airborne.
9162,"Lol straight talk is telling is it is based on all available data 

You know what the data says?"
9163,"The delta variant is highly transmissible, it is not a concern to those who have been fully vaccinated."
9164,That’s it.
9165,That's how it is.
9166,"Almost all the new cases are folks that are not vaccinated, alot of young folks among them."
9167,Most of the elderly population already got the vaccine.
9168,So it's no surprise that hospitalisations and deaths are now low.
9169,"But of course, one should not forget that hospitalisations and deaths lag behind infection."
9170,"But even so, it won't be as bad as before."
9171,Yeah it’s a possibility but this will always remain a mystery now.
9172,We both went WFH pretty early on and before that there was some weird cold going around the office that  we both got.
9173,It’s possible it was covid.

9175,"&gt; We may never need masks or lockdowns again, or we may need to do it many more times

We may ""need to"" lock down many more times, but it will never happen."
9176,"No Republican governor will ever agree to it, and lockdowns won't work in the states with Democratic governors if their neighbors aren't doing them too."
9177,"The CDC took the (I think) rather sensible position of saying that if you are vaccinated, certain things (almost everything) are safe, masked or unmasked."
9178,The data supports this.
9179,"The mRNA vaccines, in particular, are still ~90% effective at preventing any symptoms at all for the delta variant), 96% effective at preventing hospitalization, and even better than that at preventing death."
9180,The case fatality rate in the UK for the delta variant is 0.1%.
9181,"Fauci, Osterholm, Gottlieb, Jha have all said the CDC's decision was the right call."
9182,"The CDC made it an individual choice, which is sort of the only option once people decided against vaccine passports/mandatory vaccination (which are a much smaller infringement upon our rights than lockdowns, might I add!)."
9183,Those who are at risk and cannot be vaccinated can and should continue to take precautions.
9184,"N95s are readily available  Cases right now are more than 10x lower than they were last fall, and while this is expected to rise, it will help protect some of the people who cannot be vaccinated."
9185,"Hopefully in 2 months we can start vaccinating kids, which will help even more."
9186,There could be a variant that is super infectious and not cause serious illness as well.
9187,"In the end, if that new variant dominates and creates immunity through a mild infection then we catch a lucky break."
9188,SARS did indeed disappear on its own.
9189,Viruses with high mortality rates aren't very successful in infecting a lot of people - like Ebola or SARS.
9190,The main takeaway is double vaccinated doctors and nurses who are exposed to higher than regular viral loads still dont get very sick.
9191,But the main fear is transmission from them and we still dont know how much vaccines  stop transmission.
9192,Dont panic folks.
9193,Looks like numbers from the UK.
9194,"They are producing a lot of data on Pfizer, and they/Canada employed a one shot for all strategy with a delayed (by months) second shot."
9195,"They are now being overwhelmed by Delta and restarting precautions, as of today."

9197,&gt; This might become available to other countries in South America and other places that can’t afford vaccines.

9397,Sincerely asked.
9398,Do I have the obligation to save them if they won’t do that for themselves?
9399,"I understand the folks that cannot vaccinate and are compromised have been dealing with that before this pandemic in their own way, God bless them, and will continue in their own way."

I hear this all the time and my response?"

9405,It may have been seen as right or the best back then but things change.
9406,We grow and we learn and we do better.

9408,"Children have rights and while I may not trust all 8 year olds to know what's medically best for them, some can actually make informed decisions about their care and a greater number of teens certainly are more than capable to consent to immunizations."
9409,"66% of infected people do not get PVS, you made that up."
9410,It goes far beyond the most dire of bad predictions.
9411,Masks will be a forever thing.

9413,Hugs.
9414,I'm with you man.
9415,I want my old life back.
9416,I'm less hopeful that this round of vaccination is enough to get us all through this...

9444,My coworker was bedridden for 4 weeks and still has occasional brain fogs 2 months later.
9445,"Get vaccinated, folks."
9446,Crazy anti-vaxxers

9449,“May” isn’t enough detail to help me modify my behavior.
9450,"Canadian here, despite a slow start (which I was extremely critical of), Canada has vaccinated at stunningly fast rate."
9451,"It's likely that we will exceed 80% uptake and higher in eligible populations, with full two dose coverage expected by the end of July."
9452,"So far, in individual provinces, hospital admissions have been driven into the ground, with many provinces not reporting any rise in admissions for a number of weeks."
9453,There is a very good chance that Canada will be one of the most vaccinated countries in the world by the end of July.
9454,"So far, Delta outbreaks have been suppressed even in major cities through targeted vaccinations."
9455,"Right now uptake is lower in the younger population, but this is likely the result of vaccinations opening up later for them."
9456,I'm not judging you.

9465,May I ask what state?
9466,Except only 20% of young adults in Finland have gotten one dose.
9467,And that doesn't change the fact that you could still spread it when only 17% of the population is fully vaccinated.

9475,Our health minister published some data from june 17th to June 23rd.
9476,In this period 37% of covid deaths were fully vaccinated with sinovac.
9477,"That is concerning, however:

-They failed to mention the age of the diseased and health status

-It's full-on winter here, so it is expected that other diseases contributed to covid's lethality

-it's just a 6 day period, too small to draw conclusions


Nevertheless, still a bit concerning."

9492,Going to eat indoors at a restaurant vs. eating outside is a big difference and if you can choose one over the other your risk is a lot lower.
9493,Wearing a mask along with vaccination is also going to keep you safer.
9494,Vaccination isn't as safe as you will get.
9495,You can still continue to reduce risk in other ways
9496,Okay.

9525,It would make room for new companies that report the truth
9526,[removed]
9527,The second part of this post I completely agree with.
9528,As to the first part of the post... those with underlying conditions that can't get the vaccine need to do what they can to protect themselves (and I would wear a mask around them if need be).
9529,Those that have access to the vaccine and choose to NOT take it (the vast majority of non vaxxed in the US) need to be careful and understand if they get covid its going to be rough.
9530,But I'm at the point that I'm not going to go out of my way to keep them safe anymore.
9531,"We all did our part to keep each other safe when there wasn't a vaccine because we all had something at stake: now, our health is truly our choice."
9532,"If you get the vaccine, you will be fine."

9547,"From what I’ve heard, the safety trials for these vaccines were not any faster or shorter than usual."
9548,They usually see how long the immunity from a vaccine lasts before they approve it.
9549,Since immunity from COVID was needed in the short term it was approved for emergency use.
9550,Safety was not an issue.
9551,Sounds good to me.
9552,I just feel bad for the poor medical workers who will have to bust their asses while these idiots choke to death on ventilators.

9669,I really hate to throw back the curtain from your binary world but there are many places somewhere in middle of the two extremes where it will have an effect.
9670,Good for them
9671,Mask required messaging is sometimes confusing.
9672,Some stores removed the big mask required sign but still has the general covid warning notice which states masks required in small text up but employees aren't wearing masks.
9673,Some have a big picture of a mask making you think they still require masks but the sign text says masks not required for vaccinated people.
9674,I went to one place that said mask required/curbside only but they weren't doing curbside anymore.
9675,Sometimes they have mask required sign at some entrances but not others.
9676,one other thing we learned is that masking up and socially distancing greatly reduces the ability of other things that arent covid-19 to spread.
9677,everyone should mask up if they cannot stay home or socially distance when they are sick in the future.

9730,Why be proactive and avoid the problem when you can just wait until it’s actually a problem and hope you can play catch up fast enough?
9731,I’m vaccinated.
9732,I know they aren’t 100%.
9733,Immuno compromises and kids do not have a vaccine.
9734,I have no problem wearing a mask in public (even when outdoors) because I’m not a selfish piece of shit.
9735,But unfortunately most of this country (the US) is.
9736,What a soft life one must lead if wearing a mask is an undue burden for them.
9737,Absolutely.
9738,I'm in favour of vaccines (I've had my first) but I was completely against the decision to extend lockdown beyond June.
9739,Then they should implement some official exemption documentation.l that they can present when asked
9740,This is incorrect.
9741,A PCR test amplifies genetic material.
9742,"If you have been fully vaccinated, and are asymptomatic, the test can pick up any genetic material from an exposure event, even if it is unable to infect or replicate with any degree of relevance."
9743,"As such, these people are not actually *positive* although they may have genetic material that could be picked up on a PCR test."
9744,Think of it like individuals with HIV whos viral titers are so low they are unable to transmit the virus *at all* or have any symptoms.

9750,Contenental Europe is the mainland of Europe which excludes the islands.
9751,"Ireland is in Europe, but its further west, so England is in Europe, cause its a country on an island on the European continental plate..."
9752,Sucks for them.
9753,I got you.
9754,My question is where does it end ?
9755,What’s a “safe” environment?….There’s going to be strains of this crap for the foreseeable future… if you’re vaccinated you’re protected until there’s scientific evidence that says otherwise.
9756,There’s always some health risk somewhere from something.
9757,I don’t want to be “that guy” but I just don’t think some people want to work or at least in the traditional sense and they’re using covid to avoid it.
9758,I’ve watched from the outside as the threshold for teachers going back to the classroom got moved numerous times.
9759,If you don’t feel safe on a classroom it’s time to look for a new line of work.
9760,Education is as critical as it gets

9782,Delta is going to be the variant that hits the conservative Qturds in rural areas that have been denying COVID exists and it is going to be ugly.
9783,I live in one of those areas and I am basically in self imposed lockdown for the foreseeable future because nobody (maybe 5%?)
9784,wears a mask in public or maintains any kind of distancing.
9785,It is just business as usual.
9786,In my county 1 out of every 365 people died of COVID over the past 15 months.
9787,But that hasn't been enough for the death cultists.
9788,I don't know how high the deaths have to get before people will pay attention.
9789,It's safe.
9790,To say it's not safe is to be so literal that almost nothing is safe.
9791,"Hundreds die in shower/toilet accidents every year, is it not safe to take a shower?"
9792,"In the highest risk group for Johnson and Johnson they estimate there is still a less than 1 and 100,000 chance of developing the condition in question, and some fraction of those die, so far 1 that I'm aware of (and it's still not conclusive)."
9793,Yes I do.
9794,I do not even remotely agree with it but I do think it will be a thing.
9795,If my kids aren't forced to wear a mask to school in September I'll eat my hat.
9796,"Yes, it is irresponsible."

9798,Some people would describe the civil rights movement as defiant.

9800,"If we hit 80% fully vaccinated, you think mask mandates will be a thing?"
9801,[removed]
9802,This whole thing is because of social media.
9803,There are no grey areas anymore when it comes to opinion.
9804,I saw this so many times during both the 2016 and 2020 elections.
9805,You either believe exactly what I believe or you're a horrible human being that deserves death threats.
9806,The same goes for the pandemic.
9807,"I got the vaccine and think others should as well, but I am against extreme restrictions and would never support a government forcing people to get vaccines they don't want."
9808,And I have been called a murderer for having those views.
9809,I only partly agree with that.
9810,"The thing is, Americans at the low end of income earn a lot more in terms of purchasing power than the same Americans, say, 100 years ago."
9811,"An American in the 75th percentile earns a lot more than, say, a Portuguese in the same percentile."
9812,The deference is that low income Americans have lost a cultural memory of how to feed themselves - less so in other countries.
9813,"These folks couldn’t even tell a turnip from a sweet potato, much less what to do with one."
9814,I live in Asia where low income folks buy cheap produce at wet markets.
9815,"There must be well over 50 different cabbages, mushrooms, tubers, and fruits."
9816,"People can’t afford beef, but they know how to work with cheaper ingredients."
9817,I’m also struck by the way American cooks at cheap eats have such a limited skill level.
9818,"It’s mostly short-order burgers, fried eggs, BLTs, etc - things that anyone could learn in an afternoon."
9819,Whereas Portuguese cheap eats have variety and complexity and regional styles typical for each cook.
9820,"The skill level is much higher, which reflects a population that is more skilled overall regardless of income."
9821,"The “food deserts” in low income American neighbourhoods are due to a lack of demand, not an inability to supply."
9822,"To be clear: obesity is a universal problem, with countries like the UK only 5 years “behind” the US."
9823,"And plenty of sugar-rich countries are worse off than the US (eg México, Kuwait, Indonesia, Fiji, etc)."
9824,"Everyone is slowly losing the cultural knowledge of how to feed themselves, mostly because processed food is cheap, poorly regulated, and ubiquitous."
9825,"No, taking a painkiller of any sort after vaccination will not affect the vaccine."
9826,"You know what can also stay in your body, has been around for only about a year, has no long term testing, and can cause heart problems?"
9827,The SARS-CoV-2 virus.
9828,"Refusing to get vaccinated because of possible side effects and taking your chance with the virus is like refusing to fly because of plane crashes and taking your chances driving, which is much more dangerous."
9829,"I can see this vaccine being helpful to poor island nations (think Haiti, which hasn't started vaccination yet (!!!"
9830,")for example) and socialist countries that don't accept or can't afford vaccines from capitalist countries, like Nicaragua or Bolivia."
9831,"It's not the vaccine itself which is triggering the bureaucracy, this isn't even about the AZ vaccine, it's about a version the SII made which requires separate approval."
9832,Of course that doesn't stop those with agendas jumping on the news to slate AZ further.
9833,Yep we need to step up vaccine manufacturing.
9834,Adjusting for population this would be equivalent to ~12k cases in the US.
9835,India has done a good job getting its outbreak under control after a rough April/May.
9836,Hopefully the govt and leaders learned something from this and can prevent another wave.
9837,This is less scary than it sounds because there are more vaccinated than unvaccinated people in Israel.
9838,"“When asked how many of the new coronavirus patients have been vaccinated, Levy said that ""We're looking at a rate of 40 to 50 percent,"" and said that the figure is concerning.”"
9839,"I posted an article that clarified the misinformation and included:
Gottlieb: Half of “adults” infected in Israel were fully vaxxed, not half of all cases."
9840,About half of the total infections were kids.
9841,"Means about 25% of infections were in fully vaxxed, and most if not all were reportedly asymptomatic infections

9871,"Sorry i can’t help you regarding side effects, but i can tell you i know multiple older people 65+ who had Pfizer and reported little side effects."

9880,AstraZeneca jab is incredibly effective based on the real world data from the UK.
9881,At this point it should be approved.
9882,I also bet that many countries that said no to AZ are regretting it seeing its real world effectiveness in the UK.
9883,The article is not implying that the CCTV footage is the 'research.'
9884,"Research: ""The Delta variant is 60 percent more transmissible than the Alpha variant"" 

Anecdotal evidence: ""“scarily fleeting” encounters of roughly five to 10 seconds between people walking past each other""

9888,We didn't have an indoor mask requirement until 2 days ago.

9912,"The Scotland study which states vax 79% protection against delta has me a BIT more concerned (for elderly fully vaxxed family members), but i am hoping the vaccine effectiveness is similar between the alpha and delta."

I literally do not have family."

10001,This has been over for me since around 3 months after it started.
10002,&gt;we are all waiting for a decent vaccination rate for the younger age groups.
10003,Everyone I know in my age bracket have had their first dose and were given Pfizer.
10004,I booked a vaccination for a friend and the slot was next day.
10005,I have no idea how the Australia model works long term.
10006,"Getting vaccinated will not prevent the virus from spreading, as seen in the current UK case."
10007,"Let's say they vaccinate 70% of their population, the rest don't want it."
10008,What's next?
10009,"They let it loose and ravage the rest 30% of the country, with case numbers they have never seen before?"
10010,"Or they continue to do strict lockdowns if there is any community spread, but how long can they do that 5 years?"
10011,"In Europe after we had vaccinated everyone who wanted, we will probably let it loose as it will be not as bad as the previous waves."
10012,"To be honest we barely contained it before, so not much will change in this regard."

10014,3 hours and no discussion :(… I guess this is a good thing and the virus is finally behind us know in the us

10032,"We had some Beta cases where I live in Germany, and some German states actually saw lots of Beta cases for a while."
10033,"It seems like Beta is not very contagious, so it is unable to spread exponentially under ""light lockdown"" conditions."
10034,"It's also not fully vaccine evading, so now that we have an okay-ish vaccination rate, it fails to spread because of that – even with only pretty mild measures remaining."
10035,Makes sense.
10036,The vaccines are only something like 80% protection against the new Delta Variant.
10037,There's always a risk you're that 20%.
10038,But the risk of severe enough symptoms to get hospitalised is only around 4%.
10039,"In the UK only about 10% of hospital admissions for the Delta Variant had been fully vaccinated, with two thirds of patients being unvaccinated, because they were ineligible (so mostly young people)."
10040,And there were no deaths in patients under the age of the 50 who were fully vaccinated.
10041,Evidence is still you are orders of magnitude better off getting vaccinated.
10042,This kind of opinion is why these protests are so necessary.
10043,[deleted]
10044,No problem.
10045,"When I say 'may or may not work', I mean (and the makers are up-front about this) that there is some evidence that it can help, but not enough to know whether it would have returned naturally."
10046,That would require large-scale trials that no-one is going to fund.
10047,"It may help your brain relearn correctly, as I know some who've got it back have found things smell/taste differently."
10048,"And as I say, at the very least you get the positive reinforcement of realising that you're getting it back."
10049,"For me it was fits and starts - I would test myself with each jar and one morning I'd suddenly be able to tell which jar I was sniffing, the next day less so."
10050,But the trend was overall in the right direction and now I'm back to normal.
10051,"kinda scary that people are taking medical decisions based on these things ""you should definitely take a booster"" says one random person who is not really in charge?"
10052,"based on what, instinct?"
10053,Because we didn’t think having dead people was a good outcome.
10054,Lmao that was metaphorical.
10055,Yes it does suck they can't break up.
10056,But that's life.
10057,Not much really.
10058,He wasn’t thrilled but didn’t make a big deal about it.

10072,Where are we getting the vaccines from????
10073,"AZ is now only for over 60s, we can make that."
10074,"Pfizer, which is the only other vaccine we have approved, is in short supply because the USA isn’t/wasnt exporting and the EU needed what they were producing."
10075,I don’t get how people don’t realise this
10076,Well some wives are really nice.
10077,Some are like his wife.
10078,Just dont stick your dick in crazy.
10079,Are the teenagers who partied on spring break the same teenagers who need their parent's permission to get covid shots?
10080,I imagine these are two different age groups

10092,I have no contact with them since may 2021.
10093,"Age 45 as a boundary sounds pretty specific but logical in a way, as HIV/AIDS was 1st reported in 1981."
10094,I imagine there are now a couple full generations who don't remember a time when even rich western countries were as scared of any disease as we've been these past 16 months.
10095,Sounds like the younger anti/non-vax crowd are this way because they never experienced a time where not getting a vaccine had direct effects they can observe in their community.
10096,"Maybe HIV is a bad example here as there is no vaccine for it, but the available treatments also originate in the same professional area (medical science)."
10097,"The older people are, the more memories they have of people having their lives cut way short or having their lives ruined by diseases."
10098,Do school education systems cover vaccines in their curricula?
10099,So basically this will happen in Europe in a month in the middle of summer holidays?
10100,All countries in lockdown or sky high infections rates.

10102,"It has indeed, like in the rest of EU, with the exception there is no cutting in line."
10103,"Like with your economy and brexit, I'm pretty sure you guys will find a way to fuck this up too."
10104,Damn you're dumb
10105,The CDC made the right call.
10106,The vaccines are much more effective than anything we’ve had previously.
10107,The vaccines are effective against the variants.
10108,"They prevent illness, severe illness, hospitalization, and death."
10109,They’re not 100% but they are extremely effective and the CDC acknowledged that fact
10110,Where I’m from there’s a neighboring town that has a bar called Library.
10111,I used to pass it every Sunday going to church and my brother and I thought it was funny if we walked in and said “we thought this was a library”.

10114,The youngest boomers are 56 now.
10115,"So, the only boomers relevant in this are those with teenagers, children they would have had between 38 and 43 years of age."
10116,"That happens, but it is far from the norm."
10117,Parents of teenagers in the US are going to primarily be gen-x.
10118,"And, as other's have pointed out, boomers have some of the highest rates of covid vaccination."
10119,"This shouldn't even be a debate, what the fuck."
10120,Science-based solutions for science-based hospitals!
10121,Better than Powerball odds.
10122,I keep seeing people saying to wear a mask despite being vaccinated.
10123,The vaccines are effective.
10124,They protect you and they protect me and they are much more effective than anyone could have hoped for this time last year.
10125,There will always be variants - that’s literally how viruses work.
10126,"Proof of that is despite the country having largely reopened, cases have dropped."
10127,"Even if you vaccinate 70% of the country here, that still leaves much of Europe and Asia unvaccinated."
10128,The CDC acknowledged that fact - albeit not on public transportation despite being allowed not to wear one almost anywhere else.
10129,Now was the timing of the announcement political like some have suggested - could have been but it was still the right call.
10130,Every decision made by the government has a political calculation.
10131,They are not just public servants even though it’d be nice to think that.
10132,"The WHO coming out saying people vaccinated have to wear a mask and same thing in Israel is insane - not only do you massively confuse the public, but you lose all credibility as an organization when you flip flop or send conflicting messages"
10133,Thank you for your kindness.
10134,If the world had more kindness for people we don’t personally know maybe there wouldn’t quite so many people forced to mourn a loved one.
10135,Blessed be!
10136,Ok!
10137,"I hope so, that makes me feel a bit hopeful?"
10138,I don’t know what to think.
10139,I am finding all of this so frustrating
10140,Yep.
10141,It only takes one person to set off a pandemic.
10142,I understand people not wanting to get the covid shot.
10143,What I don't understand is those same people trying to prevent others from getting the covid shot.
10144,"Oh, that's ghastly."
10145,"People turning turning perfectly good doses in the first world, too."

10149,"Bruh fauci said 10k a day would be great, and we are only 5k away from that..so yeah...it is pretty great."
10150,It's in the virus's best interest to not kill you so you can infect others.
10151,That's why 70% of people have Herpes-1 and nobody has Ebola.
10152,Herpes is a much more evolved virus.
10153,"Yes, I think it would, actually"

10155,"Meanwhile, JnJ vaccine recipients can’t get second shot, even if you want one."
10156,They need to make this available.

10159,I didn’t think about the vax

10162,"As you said, ""Boomer"" come from the baby boom, i.e., increased birth rates, after WWII which finally tapered off around 1964."

10164,My oldest daughter was born in 1969.
10165,Almost a second generation boomer!
10166,"Oh, I know all about it."
10167,The day after I got my second Moderna vaccine I felt like death warmed over.
10168,It's why I strongly advise anyone getting their second mRNA vaccine to take the next day of work/school off.
10169,When your anti-vax propaganda accidentally brainwashes your own country.
10170,Long term/potentially permanent anosmia seems pretty severe to me though
10171,Sorry you had see your friends go through that first hand
10172,I don’t understand how this is a “vaccine gap”.
10173,It’s just a lot of dumb people preferring to risk having a tube shoved down their throat to enjoy their last week of life on a ventilator instead of effectively evaluating relative risks of disease versus vaccine.
10174,Some parents are just controlling for the sake of having control.
10175,I asked to dye my hair red or black and got this response and then tricked into hi lights making me almost blonde by my mom because “it’s not your hair and I like it this way”.
10176,"Probably because WHO dispenses advice for the whole planet, not just for the USA, and so they have to tailor advice for countries with both low and high rates of vaccinations."
10177,So they are erring on the side of caution because most places in the world don’t have the relatively high % of people vaccinated that the US does.
10178,CDC issues advice specific to our country.
10179,"So, the WHO warning may not be as applicable in the US, particularly in states with high rates of vaccines."
10180,No.
10181,"The virus does, not the vaccine…."
10182,"Nah, America's mission to destroy the poor means they won't do this"
10183,Individual humans are not good at assessing risks.
10184,Look at the fact we would rather have coal than nuclear power stations.
10185,Some people on here seem to think that the end goal is to eradicate Covid.
10186,There is no way to do that - at least not in the short term.
10187,That’s because no vaccine is 100% effective.
10188,"More than that, this virus has been circulating for over a year now globally."
10189,"Even if we got every single last person vaccinated domestically, there’s still many other countries that haven’t been vaccinated anywhere close to the level we have been."
10190,That’s the problem right there.
10191,"At a certain point, we do have to accept a certain level of risk and live our lives as many Americans across the country are doing."
10192,There is no need for a vaccinated person with Pfizer or Moderna to still wear a mask.
10193,They are over 90% effective against the original strain and still about the same against the Delta variant.
10194,"Even if you get sick, you are still less likely to get severe symptoms."
10195,The goals of public officials have also shifted so much.
10196,"At the beginning, it was two weeks to slow the spread."
10197,"Even if you blame our response to Covid, that still ignores other countries."
10198,Every country has seemingly had a different response - even to this day.
10199,"More than that, governors across the country said - follow this for two weeks or a month only to extend it many times."
10200,We can’t live a life of fear forever.
10201,"I hear people talking about new variants of concern and locking things back down as if every time there is a new variant, everything comes to a dead stop."
10202,The issue also with booster shots is there is no way to stay ahead of the variants with how quickly the virus spreads.
10203,"At some point, the world has to accept a higher risk and know that there are people that will never be vaccinated."
10204,Of course you can say not everyone followed the rules that were in place.
10205,"That was never going to happen - whether in the US, the UK, or other countries."
10206,"I wore a mask for a year, I got vaccinated - now some people on here particularly want to say wear a mask despite what the CDC says."
10207,Wear a mask despite what the president says that vaccinated people are safe.
10208,The vaccines aren’t 100% effective but what message does it send when a country like Israel tells people you now have to wear a mask even if vaccinated?

10223,I am continuing to wear a mask in indoor spaces and crowded outdoor ones for the time being.
10224,"To me, it's like continuing to wear a seatbelt even after I got a car with airbags."
10225,"No harm done, and hopefully some good."
10226,"By the way, there are different kinds of masks."
10227,"""Surgical"" and regular cloth masks don't do a heck of a lot to protect you from airborne viral particles exhaled by others, but N95 masks do."
10228,"Wearing the latter is something you can do to feel more comfortable in crowded and indoor spaces, regardless of whether other people are wearing masks or not."
10229,CDC made that decision based on evidence that vaccines in the US protect against Delta.
10230,"Nothing has changed since then, you are protected."

10347,"Granted, there were geniuses who *made* what formal education nowadays is (or used to/should be), but if you are asking here in reddit.... What a surprise: you are n o t that guy :)

So... Leave my coke alone."
10348,It gives me.... Electrolytes!
10349,"Beta actually has the most escape, with Qatar data showing it at 75 percent effectiveness compared to 80 percent for Delta."
10350,However Delta is more infectious.
10351,As more of the world becomes vaccinated though a future variant will likely emerge that is able to bust through the vaccine and demonstrate sustained transmission.
10352,It’s so weird because I didn’t even think of the vaccine when I found out about he first one.
10353,"I was just very concerned (it’s someone close to me), but then when it happened to someone else I kind of know I was like, wait a minute, what the fuck kind of coincidence is this?"

10389,Idk who my daughter was getting her info from because it obviously wasn’t me.
10390,"She’s 19, so I can no longer ‘make her’ get a vaccine."
10391,Once it became open for 18+ I urged her over and over to make the appointment.
10392,I’ve been vaccinated since March.
10393,She said she would but she never did.
10394,Finally I had enough.
10395,"One day while I was at work, she asked me to pick up Chik-Fil-A."
10396,I asked if she had made her appointment.
10397,She said no but that she would.
10398,I said if she couldn’t be bothered to get vaccinated then I couldn’t be bothered to pick up food.
10399,She said ‘you can’t make me get it’.
10400,"I said ‘no, but I don’t have to help you in other ways either."
10401,"‘ $10 here, $20 there, pick up food, etc."
10402,5 minutes later I got a screen shot of her appointment.
10403,"Lol they complain so hard while the ""precautions"" and ""lockdowns"" US did can't even be compared to other countries that got their shit together a bit"
10404,"And not to get too off-topic, but there also seems to be heavy overlap between the people not taking action against COVID and the people opposed to doing anything to address climate change."
10405,"They might not have to deal with the consequences, but as a 23 year old I will."
10406,Why should I look out for them when they're not looking out for me?
10407,"Not everyone is in as developed a nation as you seem to be, some of us are in the USA."

10409,Indoors and crowded outdoor places is where masks do help.
10410,Outside in general there is limited need for a mask if it is possible to hold 2 meters distance.
10411,I was tottering on the edge of being more relaxed in my COVID-cautiousness.

10420,Empowering the state and/or corporations to forcibly inject chemicals into everyone's body both seems like a horrible power to have in place (what's the next thing they will inject?
10421,"), and something that's going to really infuriate the people who are worried about government/corporate overreach already (in many cases with good reason)."
10422,"The covid vaccine would become vastly more politicized than it already is, and become a rallying cry for a big chunk of the population who is either genuinely worried about it or sees political power in trying to exploit it."
10423,From his decision making process and strange adherence to cult mentality... His chances are probably higher than you think.
10424,But isn't the chance of getting sick if you have the vaccine much much lower?
10425,"I know there are breakthrough cases with the delta variant, but your pure risk of spreading it (considering your risk of contraction in the first place is very low) is lowered by more than 50%."

10437,"If the virus was more deadly, even with a long incubation period, people would take more precautions, and would be stopped sooner."
10438,"As a member of the dental field, she will also likely lose her job."
10439,"I would think that being in a recirculated air environment, combined with lack of masks and a higher viral load of the delta variant would mean particles of potentially larger droplets would linger in the air longer."
10440,The fleeting passerby could’ve potentially inhaled significant amounts of the viral droplets as he/she walked or traced through the same footpath that the carrier was.
10441,Officials in Germany assume that we need a vaccination rate of 90% + to eliminate delta.
10442,"No country will ever reach this, at this point you have to wait until everyone get their vaccine offer and then let natural selection decimate the stupid."
10443,"In the US the death rate went up and people were protesting at state capitals, armed with automatic rifles, threatening to shoot up the legislature unless the mandates and restrictions were repealed so they could go to Denny's."

10448,As a teacher who is on their OH&amp;S commitee(which I imagine is my local version of OSHA) it was ruled that if the measures taken at the workplace follow government regulations then they are sufficient for making work safe.
10449,We had a teacher submit a work refusal mostly based on high community transmission and the fact that students were returning to school after being sent home with sympyoms without being tested.
10450,As a committee we voted that they had grounds for the refusal but when the oh&amp;s worker came in they said that because the school was following what the government required the work was not unreasonably unsafe.
10451,"I'm sure it's different everywhere, but I imagine a similar ruling would apply in offices, unfortunately."
10452,did you not read the article
10453,It's the WHOs fault.
10454,The vaccine is 90% effective at protecting against the Delta variant and cases are dropping everywhere.

10456,Law.
10457,Call it a law so people know that if they don’t wear it they’re breaking the law
10458,Anything that lowers the viral load is a good thing.

10462,I’ll wear it if it’s necessary.
10463,I’m vaccinated.
10464,It’s not necessary to wear one.
10465,Why is this still so funny?
10466,"People simply aren’t convinced that Covid will kill them, especially people in their 20s-30s where statistically it is very unlikely to even hospitalize them."
10467,"The fight against Covid is really being hurt by the rush back to office work, sometimes coupled with threats, when the Delta variants are running rampant in the USA."
10468,That is a crazy quick exposure to result in illness.
10469,Goodness.
10470,Yep.
10471,I’m in Georgia.
10472,Outside the metro areas vaccine hesitant/refusers make up a large percentage of people.
10473,There’s little that can be done to convince them.
10474,You’re fully vaccinated?
10475,"You're correct, and what the common bad faith posts here conveniently leave out is that 80% of Israeli adults are fully vaccinated."
10476,Their base rate has tilted significantly toward a vaccinated populace and the data coming out of Israel is actually reinforcing that the vaccines are working in the real world--even against Delta--about as well as we previously thought.
10477,As a fun analogy: did you know that 90% of cancer patients are right handed?

10593,Pretty much all of the low efficacy vaccines were still very high (in the 90-100% range) in preventing serious illness/hospitalizations and death.
10594,"So yeah, half the people getting those vaccines may still get the virus, but those vaccines reduce their chances of becoming seriously ill or dying to almost nothing."
10595,[removed]
10596,Oh I agree.
10597,I'm one of the people who stood at the antimasker rally and gave everyone two middle fingers.
10598,Latest figure was 43% of dead with both doses.
10599,"Which kind of makes sense: it's still older people dying from covid, and older people have been double vaccinated for quite a while now."
10600,Caveat: these are still small numbers.
10601,But growing.

10603,Thanks.
10604,I try!
10605,I’m all she’s got so it’s been a difficult road.
10606,I think they cared less because they where basically corona free for a while.

10608,In the US even if minors were given that right for the most part the privacy aspect won't matter because of health insurance.
10609,"For the most part any minors will be on their parents' insurance, so any procedure/vaccination will be run through insurance and the parents will recieve an itemized copy of the bill telling them exactly what was done."
10610,I see what you’re doing.
10611,"I’m 42 years old and I never once wore a mask in public, and I’m sure you never did either, until Covid started."
10612,I won’t in the future.
10613,"If I have the flu, I probably won’t be going out."

10615,"&gt;Example, 50% of infected in Israel are infected and fully vaccinated."
10616,"Problem is most americans are basically statistically illiterate so they read that as ""50% of vaccinated get COVID anyway""."
10617,Exactly.
10618,"I live in TX where our governor basically said ""we're leaving this up to individual responsibility."""
10619,"The anti-maskers/anti-vaxxers all cheered and said ""he's finally on our side."""
10620,They seem to forget individual responsibility at this point means you're going to get sick and possibly die (or end up with long term health issues) if you aren't vaccinated.
10621,He absolved himself of any responsibility at that point.
10622,"If they get sick and die, he can say ""not my fault...we left it up to the individual to protect themselves."""

10630,I don’t care at this point.
10631,They have no sympathy from me.
10632,They had their chance to prove themselves and they failed.
10633,The South is literally an embarrassment to the US.
10634,I’m flying next month and definitely wearing a disposable paper mask.
10635,Being vaccinated is great.
10636,You're a good parent.
10637,How?
10638,That's abysmally low.
10639,What?
10640,"No, if you have enough virus in your system to test positive, it is because the virus is being replicated inside your body ie you are acutely ill with covid."
10641,"People who get ill after vaccination have lower viral load (the virus is not replicating as effectively because the antibodies are stopping it), less severe symptoms, and shorter duration of illness."
10642,"Because of these factors, they are less likely than an unvaccinated ill person to spread the virus to others."
10643,And of course they are less likely to become ill in the first place.
10644,"I remember having the naive notion that when we plainly get to ""two America's"" (heavily vaccinated pockets living almost normal lives vs unvaccinated areas with massive amounts of sick people) that the reality will finally sink in and people will do the right thing to get their jabs."
10645,"But we're so partisan and living in each other's echo chambers, that message won't get through."
10646,"I'm sure someone here will accuse me of being in my own echo chamber, and I own up to that, but I have to believe having more sick/dying people is a truth that should rise above any partisan thinking."
10647,But alas... that won't happen.
10648,The unvaccinated will keep spreading this back and forth and create more variants that will eventually break through our current vaccines.
10649,"Boosters are a possibility of course, but it'll take months to roll them out."
10650,"I've been fortunate enough to live in a heavily vaccinated area, and have enjoyed feeling safe being in bars and restaurants, but I can't shake the feeling that this is going to slide back real soon."
10651,Then they can have a legitimate exception and I’m fully in support of bending over backwards for those people.
10652,"It’s the Karens who dropped out of Highschool who think they are smarter than the actual experts that … I don’t actively wish harm and death on, but I also don’t think we should be going out of our way to help them before people who are taking this seriously."

10654,[removed]
10655,...and theeeeeese are the people I will be wearing a mask to protect when the Delta variant steamrolls the unvaccinated in the fall....
10656,Nearly-expired vaccines which were still good.
10657,A batch with the same expiration date was later seen actively being used in Israel.

10672,It's still mostly older people dying.
10673,"And since older people are basically all vaccinated in the UK, it means that vaccinated people die."
10674,I mean... You're not going to be disease free forever.
10675,"If you get a cold or flu in the future and need to go out, you won't mask up?"
10676,Sounds good.
10677,I wish I didn’t have to wear one at all.

10691,Don’t know about you guys but the constant fear mongering and people that pop up anytime there is a sliver of bad news or potentially bad news just gets old.
10692,If you’re vaccinated - don’t be afraid to live your life.
10693,"I don’t mean that to be rude or anything, it’s just the CDC says you are safe."
10694,"I was vaccinated with Pfizer and go out to restaurants, theaters..."
10695,My zip code had pretty good mask adherence (when requirements were in place) but also has vaccination rates lower than other parts of my county.
10696,A mask mandate would definitely help here but the governor of my state has made it illegal for local officials to put one in place.
10697,Individual stores could of course put mask requirements back in place but I doubt that will happen.
10698,"*hmm*

It's easy to have 92% efficacy when the pandemic is almost over."
10699,I'd use a N95 mask to fly vs cloth.

10709,My area is one of those.
10710,Vaccination rate abt 26% in some of the rural counties.
10711,"My clinic is already as busy as it was last June and the hospitals are saying they are as full as they were in January, when numbers were highest."
10712,Every nurse I know is talking about walking out.
10713,They are SO burnt out.
10714,&gt;A couple of surprising statements there.
10715,Do we now know for sure that delta causes more severe disease?
10716,Scottish study says Delta causes more hospitalizations: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)01358-1/fulltext
10717,"Oh yeah, I would get the 2nd shot regardless because in my mind it’s not a choice between getting or not getting the 2nd shot but a choice between getting the 2nd shot or getting the real thing eventually."

10719,You are correct.
10720,"The timing is interesting though, as 4th of july tends to fill up hospitals with people who fuck around with fireworks while drunk."
10721,Plus record heat has been driving people indoors and I know the PNW ain't built with a lot of central air/good ventilation.
10722,Covid seems to be getting more opportunities the more we go round with it.

10725,I can assure you that most of the population would not follow another mask mandate.
10726,People are over it.
10727,Where those UK people fully vaccinated with two doses though?
10728,Everything I've read says they are doing a different strategy than the states.

10732,I was completely unaware of PVF before this whole ordeal.
10733,"Wonder if people will be more aware, going forward."
10734,"No,  the inactivated vaccines are ""worse""."
10735,"Even the worst vaccines we have would end the pandemic in a month if we could dose everyone,  though."
10736,But the weaker vaccines have much less sterilizing immunity so those vaccinated can sometimes still transmit the virus (and with delta this effect is magnified and happens with mrna too).
10737,Going to take a while.
10738,The world is falling apart so many things are put on hold while trying to save the nation.
10739,The United States is falling apart.
10740,"&gt;According to Public Health Services head Dr. Sharon Alroy-Preis, as of Wednesday night some 891 people had been diagnosed with coronavirus in the last month, 50% of whom were fully vaccinated."
10741,Health Ministry director-general Chezy Levy further clarified that the last 99 infected people over the age of 16 had been fully vaccinated and 39 had not.
10742,I dont understand those numbers and how are they consistent with what you mention after?
10743,Shouldnt the infections in the fully vaccinated be much lower?
10744,Am i misreading the numbers?
10745,Sorry if this is an idiot question
