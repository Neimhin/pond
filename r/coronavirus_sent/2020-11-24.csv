8,Ok makes sense thanks for the background!
9,I hear you.
10,"I live in Anaheim, home to the mouse house, and many many conventions."
11,"That's where I was working, I didn't want to work full time, I'm retired."
12,"However, due to this pandemic and non paying, non Covid affected tenants, I'm back at a job, making far less and working full time again."
13,"I can work at home and I'm considering it, there's some people there who are not adherents like I am."
14,But then I have to listen to fox news blaring and someone telling me its all a plan and no one is dying in my county.
15,Rock and a hard place
16,I’ll never understand why people freak out about a photo with a license plate in it that they posted themselves.
17,Everybody that has ever seen your car has seen it and could have a photo of it.
18,If you aren’t posting photos of other people’s plates outside a strip club or something I don’t see what people are trying to hide.
19,so as long as 'the right people are being hurt' your ok with it?
20,"&amp; what are you going to do when you get an injury or illness and there is no doctor or nurses left to treat you because the hospitals are full of covid patients or they  are worn out, sick or dead from treating covid patients?"
21,don't sink to the level of those who have done harm.
22,practice enlightened self-interest doing the right things because it helps you too.
23,someday you will be even more helpless than you feel now and might be hoping someone will treat you better than you acted at fraught moments in your life.

25,Your rural pharmacy isn't a hospital and doesn't treat covid patients.
26,When distribution plans were discussed this was one problem noted with the vaccines that require ultra low temperatures.
27,"When I say rural I don't mean 1.5 hours outside a city, I mean like your neighbor is a mile or so away."
28,You should become a cop.
29,"Well it's a good thing that the FDA isn't meeting to approve the covid vaccine until December 10, over two weeks from now, after their vacations are over and they've had some time to unwind."
30,It's not like there's any real NEED for rushing approval of the 95% effective vaccine.
31,/s
32,Why are we so hung up on having this Thursday thanksgiving?
33,Well done Oregan.
34,Who’s going to take the crown from them next week?
35,They’ll be drinking Flaming Purells tonight.
36,Good.
37,The fundamentals of society that value individual freedoms are actually worth millions of people dying over.
38,"People should be responsible, but setting a precedent of government overreach is worse than any realistic number of people dying from COVID."
39,This is one of those issues where I go full crazed ranting lunatic.

45,Mk and then how much will the PBMs want too?
46,Lol.
47,I’m terrified this vaccine will end up costing way more than a lot of us can afford especially with Doomcember coming.

53,My grandma just died last Thursday from COVID.
54,"Her mind has been gone from dementia for a few years now so I'm thankful she is at peace but God damn, what a fucking embarrassment to our healthcare system."
55,You would think that the nursing homes would take the most precautions to protect our seniors but instead they are some of the most lax and we should be ashamed as a state

65,I think we are there now.
66,One of the major reasons the CFR was so high early on in the northeast is because hospitals were overwhelmed.

69,Probably good news.
70,There is an article about what they post when it's breaking a couple of minutes later.
71,I'd rather read an article then a tweet.
72,"I’m glad officials are being more overt in their messaging, but I just really wish they would have ramped this up several weeks ago"
73,I don't agree with your judgement on blaming Trump for everything related to the out of control of covid-19 spread within the US.
74,"Trump is the result of the populist and anti-intellectualist American people, but not the origin of those irrational people."
75,"However, you could argue that Trump's four years as POTUS encourage the popularity of that stupid stuff."
76,Trump himself is a strong political movement rather than a simple narcissistic political figure.
77,"BTW: I am a political study student from China that overwatched the US politic system for a long while, and I am totally against Trump."
78,KN95s are more rigid and they sort of dome around your nose and mouth and they don't collapse.
79,Give them a try.
80,The article states it is unclear who is supplying the freezers and that they are reportedly on backorder from known manufacturers.

83,No in person visitors unless someone is literally on their deathbed and then visitors are screened for infection and required to wear masks.

86,Starting this week we can't even do window visits where family sees their family through the window because they're trying to cut back on anyone being out and about.
87,"If they stick around, do you make it worth their **WHILE**?"

97,"Normally, that's all I experience too."
98,I feel a little bit flushed and fatigued but it passes by the next day.
99,This was very different.
100,Maybe because I take an immunosuppressant medication now?
101,Maybe it was just a random thing?
102,"I'll still get vaccines, but I'll be ready to watch for signs of a big immune system response now."

105,I love my family and can't imagine risking their lives for something so trivial.
106,I really feel nothing but empathy for medical workers right now.
107,I would hate to have to risk mine and my family's lives for those people.
108,I'm not sure I'd be able to keep doing it...I'd probably quit.
109,"I mean, if you can't be arsed to not bother to keep your own self or family safe, why should anyone bother to treat you?"
110,I'm going to feel zero empathy for all the morons who infected their families this holiday despite warning after warning after warning.
111,Zero...
112,OK with me if Cuomo decides he doesn't want NY's allotment of vaccine.

115,We have pockets of communities around here that don’t care.
116,But they do care enough to continue protesting without masks.
117,One consistent protest is held outside a local grocery store.
118,"Yeah, outside recently but a few weeks ago they marched through the store."

128,One of the greatest failures of our response to covid was not putting the dangers and cost of obesity on blast.
129,That's what Poland is doing now.
130,They pretty much achieved capacity if tests and people stopped testing themselves.
131,Government congratulates itself for lower number of sick but hospitals dont allow any more patients.
132,Soon it will be over..
133,the elderly will crater the death and hospitalization rates as well.
134,We will still be under restrictions but it will be less scary and hopefully infections will flatten.
135,Seatbelts were mandated to be standard equipment in cars in 1968.
136,"And they were usually uncomfortable, overtight monstrosities that caused more injuries than they prevented that everyone hated to wear and got in the habit of ignoring."
137,States didn't start passing mandates to wear them until the 1980s and 90s.
138,"And in many states, it's still a secondary offense you can only be ticketed for if you get pulled over for something else."
139,"And in New Hampshire, adults still aren't mandated to wear a seat belt."
140,"It passed in CA where we lived, in 1986, and my parents scoffed."
141,"But by 1987, the car **would not move** until everyone was buckled."
142,Trump has delved more into Somalia.
143,He's continued drone strikes.
144,It's more of the same with some saber rattling at North Korea and disruptions of old standing foreign policy.
145,We're in a worse place with Iran.
146,Military spending went down slightly in 2017 but has increased every year since.
147,There are still thousands of troops all over the Middle East.
148,He hasn't done any more to truly get America out of the never ending conflicts there except for spontaneously removing troops on whims.

156,I was finally able to convince my Dad this week to stay home until he gets a vaccine as he should be the first in line.
157,"He's 70, a bit overweight, and had major heart surgery in January so if he gets it, he's done."
158,He was still planning on going to Thanksgiving with my siblings/kids/SO's with about 15 people until I begged him not to for the 3rd time in a month until he caved.
159,I'm not going either but everyone else acted like it was no big deal he was going so he kept thinking it would be fine.
160,I probably saved my fathers life while my entire family just shrugged it off.
161,"My Mom passed away 20 years ago, and its like they were OK with him dying because no one wants to take care of him when he can't live by himself anymore."
162,But thats probably at least 10 years off as he's still mentally sound and works from home so its not like he's on deaths doorstep without the threat of Covid.

179,As of the 18th Moderna was expecting to have 20 million vax doses ready in the US by the end of the year.
180,Pfizer took an order for 100 million doses from the US but I have no idea whether that order has been filled.
181,I think they also ordered another 100 million from Johnson &amp; Johnson.
182,No idea on production there either.
183,"I would genuinely love to know that those doses exist and are ready to go out, but I haven't seen that reported anywhere."

## Abstract

A probe of a patient, seeking help in an emergency ward of a French hospital in late December 2019 because of Influenza like symptoms, was retrospectively tested positive to COVID-19."
239,"Despite the early appearance of the virus in Europe, the prevalence and virulence appeared to be low for several weeks, before the spread and severity of symptoms increased exponentially, yet with marked spatial and temporal differences."
240,"Here, we compare the possible linkages between peaks of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and the sudden, explosive increase of hospitalizations and mortality rates in the Swiss Canton of Ticino, and the Greater Paris and London regions."
241,We argue that these peaks of fine particulate matter are primarily occurring during thermal inversion of the boundary layer of the atmosphere.
242,We also discuss the influence of Saharan dust intrusions on the COVID-19 outbreak observed in early 2020 on the Canary Islands.
243,We deem it both reasonable and plausible that high PM2.5 concentrations—favored by air temperature inversions or Saharan dust intrusions—are not only modulating but even more so boosting severe outbreaks of COVID-19.
244,"Moreover, desert dust events—besides enhancing PM2.5 concentrations—can be a vector for fungal diseases, thereby exacerbating COVID-19 morbidity and mortality."
245,We conclude that the overburdening of the health services and hospitals as well as the high over-mortality observed in various regions of Europe in spring 2020 may be linked to peaks of PM2.5 and likely particular weather situations that have favored the spread and enhanced the virulence of the virus.
246,"In the future, we recommended to monitor not only the prevalence of the virus, but also to consider the occurrence of weather situations that can lead to sudden, very explosive COVID-19 outbreaks."
247,This is exactly why I have all of my Christmas shopping done already.
248,"But I’m privileged in that I could afford to do that, I know not everyone can."
249,:(
250,Seems reasonable to me.
251,We'll probably continue to stay in semi-quarantine until they can get enough people vaccinated.
252,I don't mind keeping a mask on if I have to go out most of next year.
253,Its not a big deal.
254,[removed]
255,"Realistically, it's being spread by workers who are either working a second essential job elsewhere or others in their household are."
256,"Unless we pay healthcare aides and support workers a wage that can support a whole family, it's unavoidable."
257,Nope.
258,Network news.
259,That was the 20 second sound bite.
260,I'm so glad I'm prepared to not leave my house at all for the next 2 months.
261,"Really worried for my family though, and sad to not see them for the holidays"
262,That's a thought and really good question.
263,I haven't seen much about what deals other countries have.
264,"I mean, Britain and the EU have talked about buying millions of doses, but it all sounds like they are trying to reassure people."
265,For which I'm personally thankful.
266,I want to be reassured.
267,To be honest I don't expect any of the vaccine producers to give up the intellectual property rights.
268,I'm more concerned about the 'price gouging' that the article mentions... and which they do a crap job of explaining what they meant.
269,"Since we don't know how long the immunity lasts, that's a bit worrisome."
270,I teach in NY and I feel it is a very good paycheck.
271,It also has amazing job security and an enjoyable day to day experience.
272,"But if I stopped getting paid for it I would quit tommorow, and I guarantee you almost all teachers will."
273,We arent doing this just for the love of students.
274,Do you think Tesla cars were developed just to improve the environment.
275,Do you think Besos streamlined shipping just so people could get products faster.
276,Do you think computers and internet were developed solely for the betterment of society?
277,"No, all these were developed by individuals who wanted more money."
278,You seem to be an eagles fan.
279,You do realize sports would completely cease to exist in your world view right?
280,They are not playing for free or food on the table.
281,"I want the vaccine, but I am nervous about it."
282,An mRNA vaccine has never been done before so how can anyone know if there will be any long term side effects?
283,Sounds like a 4 year old in my class.

287,Yes many will die and many have already died.
288,"American society has been privileged to be the most powerful country in modern times, but this comes with some disadvantages."
289,One being a sense of superiority and entitlement.
290,What I’ve learned from traveling to different countries in my life is how Americans are perceived as arrogant and  stubborn.
291,It makes sense.
292,We’ve had it relatively great for a long time and we struggle with coping with difficult changes.
293,Americans are not evil or are monsters.
294,"We are angry, stressed, outraged, scared etc because we are challenged in ways that we have a hard time dealing with."
295,When people are pushed to their limits they are more prone to behaving and thinking more irrationally.
296,This is a learning process for many of us.
297,How sure are we about all this info?
298,I believe LEGO makes one.

309,These will be talked about as the good ole days.
310,Lol.
311,This.
312,It’s not partisan.
313,This isn’t okay and they can’t normalize it for me.
314,You’re either a piece of shit or you’re not.
315,"We live among real monsters and maybe they were always there, but damn, it’s bleak."
316,Masks are the hill 70 million want us to die on.
317,Do they not love ANYONE?
318,My family is worth more than a mask.
319,It’s unbelievable.
320,For every one of those there are five who are ambivalent and might decide otherwise if pushed.
321,Don't give up on half the population just because a loud minority of these people can't ever change.
322,Most peoples opinions *do* actually adjust slowly when there is no cost or shame and no one looking or when they no longer want to be associated with some outcast minority opinion.
323,Just watch.
324,Most Trump voters in 5 years time won't admit they were *ever* Trump voters.
325,"In 10 years time many hardcore anti climate change people will say they always believed in global warming, once the cost of being in a truly outcast minority is upon them."
326,"Ask around the old folk, see how many will admit to ever protesting AGAINST civil rights movements."
327,"Change *is* possible for most of them, once the cost is high enough."
328,"Yep, vaccinations are still required for schooling in Australia."
329,It seems absurd that it wouldn't be the norm everywhere.

331,Unfortunately you are likely correct.
332,"I would say yes, and a lot of places would let you use PTO."
333,"Depends on your situation, but I'm sure you would hate to infect someone when it could have been avoided"
334,why are 80% of posts in this sub about the US
335,The people who are vehemently against masks freak me out.
336,I guess they feel the same about me!
337,"I personally would be totally okay with it if it became more normal to wear masks in public if you have some kind of illness, even colds, but I think I’m in the minority."
338,Now you are thinking like a strategic marketing exec!
339,Same temperature as semen?
340,Every beef and dairy operation im aware of is set up with L2N storage of some sort.
341,Fired during a pandemic...?
342,I’m sorry to hear that.
343,How very Dickensian!
344,I appreciate what this doctor is doing.
345,But I'm not sure the 'patient's point of view' he shows is accurate.
346,I have had the misfortune of being intubated a few times.
347,"In every case, I recall talking to doctors and nurses about it."
348,Then nothing until a few to several days later when I woke up.
349,"My understanding is that I was given Versed, which causes some amnesia, and before the doctor inserted the tube, I was given Etomidate to put me to sleep and rocuronium to paralyze me."
350,"Once the tube was in, I was infusions of propofol and Fentanyl, which kept me asleep and pain-free."
351,"&gt;The country reported nearly 2,100 covid-19 deaths Tuesday, according to data tracked and analyzed by The Washington Post."
352,"It’s the highest mark since May 6, when states reported a combined 2,611 virus fatalities."
353,"Oh, it's a *new* model."
354,New and improved I take it?
355,This is just fucking nonsense.
356,Mask usage is at least 70% in my city and we still have covid.
357,Yea.
358,No matter what side you’re on this will be bad.
359,"No one is gonna want to add another person to their lockdown, especially when you look also at restrictions hospitals are trying to put in place like limiting who can be there and such."
360,We’re just a bit screwed here.
361,"While sad, it’s fortunate that we have this technology to allow us to do this."
362,I wish he didn’t have to though.
363,Who needs a vaccine when you're going for herd immunity the old fashioned way?
364,It's as important to flatten the curve now as before.
365,"When healthcare system are overwhelmed by patients, some won't get the care/support they need in time."
366,This.
367,Masks have been compulsory in my area since April and cases are still rising here after a summer lull.
368,"&gt;Maybe that works on his wife

If that was his first reaction, as sad as it is, you are probably right."
369,He should count himself lucky that his wife doesn't have a brother like my friends.
370,Oh no.
371,That’s truly awful.
372,Lol yeah.
373,"I was like, why are they using the car logo?"
374,&gt; I keep hearing all the hospitals are gonna be overwhelmed any moment now.
375,"Hospitals *have* been overwhelmed, you just don't realize it."
376,"Taking care of an ICU patient is a very time-consuming, high-attention task."
377,"An ICU nurse is supposed to take care of just one or two patients at a time; at three patients, care starts to noticably suffer."
378,"In New York City last spring, there were hospitals where one ICU was taking care of **ten** patients."
379,You think those patients were getting good care?
380,They weren't.
381,People died because the nurse was busy taking care of a someone else when they coded or needed a medication adjustment or their oxygen increased.
382,"&gt;  It's not like mass graves

Oh, you mean like the ones in New York City in the spring?"
383,"Like [here](https://273aiv293ycr20z8q53p7o04-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/10/Burial-of-James-Smith-650x516.jpg), and [here](https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200409184745-44-week-in-photos-0409-super-169.jpg), and [here](https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200409161959-09-week-in-photos-0409-super-169.jpg), and [here](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/10/world/10virus-us-briefing-hartisland/10virus-us-briefing-hartisland-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg)."

387,&gt; I don't fear expressing my opinion because people will object.
388,&gt; I prefer not to voice the uncommonly held belief on public forums because people tend to attack and further divide.
389,"But Mitch McConnell refused to bring Pelosi's offers out to the floor, he said it would be DOA."
390,On top of that he has offered one relief bill (only $500 billion) that doesn't include stimulus checks and takes liability from corporations if they fail to provide a safe work environment.
391,"Maybe they don't know how to work together, but it's obvious the concern to the Republicans is not the American people."
392,Otherwise he would of brought the two stimulus bills the House have passed to the floor.
393,We should at least wear masks until everyone jas access to the vaccine.
394,No sense in hurting more innocents.

404,If you're showing symptoms it's already too late.
405,You're contagious for 24 hours before showing flu symptoms.

407,Do you put pants on when you go to the store?
408,When you're around friends do you wear pants?
409,Why wouldn't you wear a mask?

421,I'm sure they're misinterpreting the physical markers.
422,A lot of after effects that sound severe are actually quite mild and common to most typical viruses.
423,"A person might get pneumonia, have it diagnosed as pneumonia, get some lung scarring and feel totally fine after."
424,"The same person might get pneumonia, have it diagnosed as covid, get some lung scarring, and feel awful because in their mind they've been ravaged by a mystery virus."
425,Ultra cold refrigerators to -90F have existed for a hundred years?
426,Back in March they were estimating it would take 18 months for a vaccine -- that's next September.
427,Anything before then is a bonus.
428,Seems America is even getting tired of itself.
429,Her handing you something is very low risk at this point.

436,"My profession quite literally never gets mentioned, but we are around hundreds of **unmasked** people at a time."
437,Indoors and in close proximity.
438,It’s terrifying and depressing knowing we are forgotten and will be lumped in with the general public.
439,We not only have to worry about our little mask protecting us against someone in that group of 100+ people being infected- but we also have to worry about being infected and then spreading it to 100+ the next day or the next week.

441,I may or may not have meant quotation marks.....

446,The science and strong public health measures help them to spread the corona virus around the world.

449,Guy approached me with his arm raised in a Walmart.
450,"I told him feel free, they only have about 100 cameras here, I'll gladly take his house and his bank acct after I sue him."

570,Compare US to EU and European countries to states for a more apples to apples comparison
571,i guess there are many countries with 20+% of their pop infected and corona isnt slowing down by any means.

659,"Is it just the environmental conditions (indoor meetings, cold surfaces) that drive infections right now, or does mobility data show that people don't follow guidelines as well as expected?"
660,well these circumstances are very unnatural
661,Then inexplicably wins the defamation suit in court despite ruining their lives.
662,"I mean, they are sure doing worse that they would if more restrictive measures were in place."
663,"But they aren't doing that bad if we compare their numbers with other european countries, like Belgium, Spain, Italy, France."
664,"I think their herd immunity strategy has clearly failed, but they get a lot of hate when they are preventing deaths of their citizens far better than other first world countries."
665,'Hamsteren' is a Dutch and I guess also German term for hoarding or panic-buying.
666,Nah It's mostly a shared value of human life.
667,I’m in health care.
668,I don’t even come close to 75K a year.
669,"My stimulus literally went to childcare and didn’t even cover all of it as we head into virtual learning yet again..   Oh btw, daycare in my area will not help with virtual learning because they can’t help all the kids."
670,So my kids are falling further behind because I can’t be teacher plus work full time plus make sure mouths are fed.
671,"And yes I am that person holding that tablet, standing off screen with your loved one that you can see in person."
672,It fucking sucks.
673,This is NOT okay.
674,Be fucking thankful you make 75k.
675,There’s plenty of us who don’t have that luxury.
676,We did https://i.imgur.com/84Zdiwz.jpg
677,I agree.
678,While we're at it let's just stop people breathing because that's the true culprit right there: breathing.
679,What you just wrote..truth.
680,That makes me think.
681,"According to medical personnel, the reason why injections make you feel sick is because the body is creating an immune response."
682,The vaccines we have are supposed to provide at least 90% protection.
683,"If someone doesn’t feel sick after an injection, does that mean they’re part of the 10% that’s not protected?"
684,Interesting.
685,Everyone else went into quarantine and the arrogant Swedes decided.
686,No.
687,We will go with herd immunity.
688,Definitely using belligerently anti-woke to describe certain people from now on
689,This is one of the misunderstandings about antibodies.
690,"Antibodies give your body the tools to fight off a known infection, you still get the infection but your body gets a head start in fighting it off."
691,"It doesn't guarantee that every time you inhale the virus, your body will always fight it off

If the viral load is too high, you're immunocompromised, you immune system is low from fighting off another illness, or even if you're just unlucky, the infection will spread faster than the body can fight it off."
692,Anytime they try and roll back provisions I just assume they're being stupid again.
693,This is wrong.
694,Herd immunity works natural or vaccine initiated.
695,The problem is you don't actually want natural herd immunity.
696,"That's bad news, but much worse in Europe, 13 European countries had much worse death totals than the US on a per capita basis yesterday, and this morning its even worse in Belgium and Poland with over 5,000 US equivalent deaths"
697,"Tbf, most of them are either Americans or Indians."
698,People forget just how many Indians are on Reddit.
699,Do yourself a favor and search India in worldnews.
700,Most negative news about India usually have no more than 75% upvotes.
701,"Go to /r/geopolitics and look for anything negative about China, majority of them comes from India."
702,The Ford workforce?
703,"Essential, possibly."
704,Frontline?
705,No.
706,The number of delivery vehicles in use is significantly higher than a year ago.
707,There is also a spike in demand for consumer vehicles because of fear of public transit and migration from urban cores.
708,So the automobile industry is a bit essential.
709,I would guess that the reason that a hospital system's plan for vaccinating employees isn't news is because it's the kind of thing they are expected to do.
710,"Ford has on-site flu vaccinations, too, but that's rarely considered a crisis and doesn't require new equipment."
711,"If companies are getting vaccine before healthcare workers, that would be a problem, but that's not what they're talking about."
712,Yes but actually no.
713,It's not available to civilians yet.
714,"SARS-COV-1 had less than 10,000 cases in total, and spread across multiple countries, which would make it awfully hard to pick up and correlate any long term effects unless they were very common."
715,"So even if it did have effects, we might not notice them."
716,"With COVID and millions and millions of cases, any effects are going to become much more obvious down the track, yet if even 5% of cases had those long term effects, that will still have a huge societal and economic impact."
717,"(Nevermind that a large proportion of SARS-CoV-1 infected did show signficantly worse health outcomes years down the track, especially health care workers, a significant percentage of which still hadn't returned to work several years after the outbreak)."
718,More people were killed in the conventional [fire bombing attack on Tokyo on the night of 9-10 March 1945](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Tokyo).
719,I think you've misunderstood.
720,"It's ""at least 6 months"" because that's all the data we have available right now."
721,They can't claim it's any longer than that because they don't have the data.
722,"ye kinda annoying with their elementary math, as if doesnt take any time to vaccineate people."
723,it happens over night.
724,first it was -almost normal- by summer.
725,it became spring by some user estimates... a dude in a thread postet that new year might be very close to year prior- ye with trillion upvotes...
726,I cant walk to the shops without pain in my lungs and been very out of breath.
727,"Unless you are a respiratory specialist, like who I am seeing at the moment, who funny enough, told me not to do what you just said..."
728,"Pushing myself will put me in an early grave, not make me better."
729,"And 13 European countries recorded higher death tolls than the US on a per capita basis yesterday, some much higher: Belgium, Poland,Romania,Austria,Hungary,Croatia,UK,Czech Republic,Switzerland,Greece,France,Spain, Italy"
730,Knowing people that died and even losing loved ones hasn't changed a lot of people's minds so I doubt seeing images of suffering flash across a television screen would do much.
731,At this point in the pandemic everyone has pretty much chosen their side.
732,The ones that refuse to take it seriously aren't going to change.
733,"Ask on r/COVID19
They’ll give you the answer you’re looking for since that’s a science based sub"
734,The point is the vaccine will start being distributed on top of that.
735,"&gt;The vast majority of cases in Europe and the USA are contracted locally, international borders are irrelevant."
736,I'm sure that if you reflect on this sentence you'll see why it doesn't make any sense.
737,&gt;The only requirement for controlling the spread of the virus is reducing the infection rate to below 1.0.
738,It's currently below 1.0 across most countries in Western Europe.
739,Happy thanksgiving everyone
740,"Oh my lord...I’m in Ohio, and the amount of vitriol on our Governor’s twitter is scary."
741,"People openly bragging about how many people are coming over for Thanksgiving, etc."
742,"""They"" (people much smarter than me) appear to believe mRNA's success here could lead to very positive movements in the field of Cancer research."
743,Good to know that there's at least a black list system in place in China.
744,"Though, from what the Australian articles you linked were complaining, maybe if China explains and clarifies the testing methodology to the exporters, they will be more understanding of the testing results and enact better quality control on their ends."
745,Takeouts are safe because everyone preparing the food follows health guidelines.
746,Sadly pig head is from America where nobody follows health guidelines.
747,Most of us already knew for months now that all but one vaccine candidate will be two shots.
748,Where have you been?
749,"Well, it might result in ""the goverment is blocking the facts!!!"""
750,It’s weird I think many people don’t realize how bad it’s getting.
751,The covid fatigue is real.
752,They just hear covid and figure “I haven’t caught it all this time so nothjng to worry about”.
753,"5,000 a day in US equivalent numbers already in Belgium and Poland this morning on a per capita basis"
754,"These are the same people who lambast reputable news sources as ""the lamestream media,"" call university education ""liberal indoctrination,"" and ridicule ivy league graduates as ""coastal elites."""
755,Anti-intellectualism is alive and flourishing.
756,"Okay keep wearing a mask and distancing for the rest of your life then cause while vaccinated people will be allowed to return to normal, you’ll be stuck inside all day."
757,Have fun!
758,Interesting.
759,So at least some of the falls in cases will be due to less testing.
760,Of course a lot due to the lockdown as they are saying the R rate is 0.65
761,"Belgium and Poland are already at that disastrous level, Belgium reported this morning 183 deaths, that's the same as 5,124 deaths in the US---Poland reported 674 deaths, that's the same as 5,864 US deaths"
762,[removed]
763,Interesting.
764,"I read the article, specifically to figure out what hamsters had to do with anything."
765,I guess that's the German term for panic buying.
766,People who got the rona don't need the vaccine anyway.
767,"New hospitalizations were increasing by over 1,000 a day earlier in November."
768,What are they now?
769,Because vaccines don’t work
770,The difference is in the sheer amount of people that contracted covid as opposed to other viruses you mention.
771,It will result in a much higher absolute number of people with chronic issues as a consequence.
772,The benefit of it is perhaps there will be a push to really study and understand conditions like CFS/ME to finally offer those patients some relief.
773,Stab em
774,"With around 100k cases every day, compare it to last spring and the death rate has been cut by more than half, but I guess some people still want to look at the half empty glass of the scenario."

975,&gt;Yet you pretend “support the unit (for analysis) in their work with modelling and analysis” is the same and something entirely different than “help with the strategy”.
976,Yes.
977,No need to pretend.
978,Support with modelling is the same as help with modelling.

988,"No, there was one option, unconditional surrender."
989,"That was official US policy, that is what Japan as a nation that had obviously lost the war needed to accept."
990,It wasn't the US problem the Japanese government gave more a shit that the emperor remained in power than hundreds of thousands of its own citizens.
991,"Japan got nuked twice, and the Japanese Government still debated whether to surrender afterwards."
992,"100,000 Japanese soldiers became casualties in Manchuria fighting the USSR in the following 7 days AFTER Nagasaki got nuked."

1001,My buddy in the medical field said covid is like covid in that the death rate is low.
1002,Mention polio to a lot of people and they think it was very serious.
1003,A lot of these same people discount covid.
1004,"3,000 americans died from polio in 1952, a couple years before the vaccine came out."

1010,especially long distance teleportation is already restricted to adults.
1011,it was a great success using teleportation during covid to easier reach others in an instant but now it’s getting controversial for children.
1012,2018 flu wasn’t business as normal though.
1013,Flu every year stresses hospitals and some years really test the system.
1014,Hospital’s usually run at 80-9o% capacity on average otherwise it becomes financially difficult to maintain resources.
1015,Paying the salaries for staff that don’t have patients to care for example can’t be sustained long term.
1016,"Capacity is lower in the summer, higher during flu, drops at holidays because electives aren’t being scheduled, etc."
1017,20% influx of patients is a huge number.
1018,"And there could still be another 1,000,000 infections in November."
1019,December could be even worse.
1020,"Honestly it seems like the vaccine might be the thing to end the current surge, rather than restrictions or the natural ebb and flow."
1021,"What, not wanting to spend the time doing my make up every morning is mental illness?"
1022,I am mentally ill but that has nothing to do with my wanting to wear a mask.

1032,"Might be ""undeniable proof"" to you but..."
1033,"“Screw your numbers, take my purely anecdotal evidence instead!”"
1034,"Not to say that they are all the same, but I’d say there’s probably 70+ million people I would watch that"
1035,I'm pretty sure that's assault with a deadly weapon in all states.
1036,As i've pointed out before in this post the assault is the threat.
1037,Battery is the damage
1038,Start hanging these criminals at high noon for others to see.
1039,I'm tired of all the winning
1040,You seem like an upset little person.
1041,Cheer up buddy.
1042,Because the deadlier the virus the higher chances are it will kill the host before spreading.
1043,Corona is at a sweet spot between infectious rate and mortality.
1044,And then they get shot by someone with an IQ lower than his age.
1045,"This is America, there's no winning."
1046,They aren't.
1047,You're free to make money elsewhere.
1048,If companies wanted healthy workers they would give them healthcare.

1053,Where does that 10 month long cough come from?
1054,I should have invested in cough drop manufacturers.
1055,Just like we should all be able to agree that stemming the spread of a deadly and highly infectious respiratory virus is a good thing.
1056,Are you a nurse in the ICU?
1057,That isn’t at all what is going on here.
1058,Former Canadian ministers took science to war and won.
1059,"Like Trump and every Republican president before him denying climate change and doing irreparable harm, Canada has its share of moron leaders as well."
1060,It has nothing to do with ‘big pharma’ and everything to do with thinking pharmaceuticals aren’t needed at all.
1061,forget violating physical distancing or corona.
1062,Assault is any reasonable threat to another person.
1063,Battery is the actual use of force.
1064,Assault is a felony (or crime depending on state) in any part of the US even if you never make contact.
1065,that's why that happens!?!
1066,I knew something was always up with why I updates wouldn't appear
1067,"Woah, that’s a lot."
1068,I wonder what the average number of people hospitalized at any given time for things like heart disease and cancer are.
1069,"I mean, some people can't manage a mask because of respiratory issues."
1070,Face shield?
1071,Easier for them and much better at stopping the virus spread than just air
1072,Except it will creep towards 5+% depending on patient volume and overloading of the hospitals.
1073,Seriously.
1074,Political differences would disappear if an invading force came to American shores.
1075,A few tasks for everyone on this sub who continues to push the “Sweden is a failure” narrative.
1076,1.
1077,Look up their current world standing in COVID deaths per capita.
1078,2.
1079,Look up their all cause mortality figures in comparison to recent years.
1080,3.
1081,Look at their latest data on deaths per day.
1082,4.
1083,Meditate deeply.
1084,&gt; Seasonal doesn't mean it stops in summer.
1085,Fair enough.
1086,"But it's also clear that its very much unlike cold which virtually disappears in Summer..

&gt;It was also abundantly clear  it was seasonal when it stopped ravaging Sweden when it heated up without much social distancing."
1087,There is nothing clear about that conclusion.
1088,"In particular, why did not it stop ravaging California?"
1089,"Which has been wearing masks and having a stricter lockdown...

Herd immunity (Sweden has reached a far higher infection rate than California) was a by-far easier explanation than seasonality..

Fun fact: South CA started ALSO started declining in Aug, as did TX, AZ and FL, with apparently no new measures and decline was clearly not seasonal."
1090,"Their infection rates have however reached/surpassed Sweden's thus adding more support to the herd-immunity-only-requires-20% infection ratestheories...

Of course, it's all water under the bridge right now..."
1091,for once the german name seems nice and funny... of course it's bad.
1092,Of course it’s Kentucky.
1093,The state collectively stupid enough to keep re-electing Mitch fucking McConnell.
1094,I think they should make a temporary ICU with glass walls on the Whitehouse South Lawn.
1095,"Ambulances driving up to it all hours of the day and night, tearing up the sod, lights flashing."
1096,Refrigerator trailers parked to the side.
1097,I think attempted murder is what these anti-maskers are gunning for.
1098,"&gt; Yep, I'm bitches

If it makes you feel any better at all, men like this typically hate themselves WAY more than they hate women"
1099,I live in a rural county and when I go to the store I carry And wear my mask because of the anti-maskers causing problems and politicized mask wearing.
1100,I’ve had plenty of stink eye from folks who refuse to cover their mugs.
1101,We have a Lot of Texan tourists who come through and almost None of them wear masks and act belligerent when told to put on a mask or leave the grocery store.
1102,I was in construction for decades and had to wear P95s all day long regularly when working in hazardous conditions so I Know someone can wear a mask for 20 minutes while grocery shopping.
1103,We’re Doomed.
1104,"You know that’s the exact opposite of what you meant, right?"
1105,Banning things you disagree with is fascist.
1106,"Openly discussing ideas, good or bad, is freedom."
1107,"By your Logic all the news networks are fascist, as well as all politicians, because they ALL lie and use misinformation."
1108,especially remembering how many are in prison for life even now for over 30 years now.... from the same laws he was able to dodge
1109,"Dude, people are bitching and moaning about masks and personal choice for an extremely simple change in their life; you think you can do anything about factors for obesity?"
1110,People would fight tooth and nail if you got the government involved in the foods people love.
1111,"Like, do you think obese people don't know it's unhealthy to be obese?"
1112,I bet a lot of those same people feel that it's authoritarian for the government to NOT let people openly carry assault rifles in Wal-Mart.
1113,Exactly.
1114,I'd rather have a 100% susceptibility to the virus than a 10-40% susceptibility.
1115,More horse shit from big pharma.
1116,*homer voice* I like those odds!
1117,And this is just the deaths from hitting 100k/day starting to materialize....
1118,"Yeah, you can kinda tell who the people are who have never had to deal with this kind of stuff."
1119,I've had a brother die of HIV and a mom from Leukemia; they kill the immune system and a cold or flu usually finishes you off.
1120,"Agree that there has been some very good news in relation to vaccines, but I'm struggling to understand how you think that law enforcement's failure to lift a finger to help this country in her time of need is somehow a good thing."

1128,"Like I said;  I'm not saying it doesn't exist, just that it never came up."
1129,I was in a demography course and when we discussed fertility rates and China's one child policy; they clarified the policy and informed us about how after the first child their are tax penalties.
1130,They saw this not as a government overreach but as a reasoned policy that provided all couples some access to a limit resources.
1131,"As far as concentration camps, I'm reminded of ""internment camps"" we (US) had during WW2 and the fact the we have extreme racial differences in incarceration rates."
1132,Once again; these were topics that didn't come up; but they exist.
1133,What were they?
1134,They are a winner and an absolute success story.
1135,It’s when you fudge the details and take articles like these on face value that the narrative becomes otherwise.

1138,Case in point.
1139,My argument is why are we SURPRISED by this?
1140,Like seriously?
1141,What did you expect?
1142,Counting on hundreds of millions of people to “stay home” and not interact is stupid.
1143,Stupid.
1144,Stupid.
1145,This was 100% the failure of the government.
1146,100%.
1147,Human behavior needs to be accounted for when calculating a national strategy.
1148,"“In a perfect world this” “in a perfect world that” yeah, but politics and strategy need to be realistic."
1149,It’s not realistic to assume people are okay with staying home indefinitely.
1150,Are we talking cases or mortality?
1151,Mortality is low in Sweden and it looks like things went according to plan.
1152,Compare current Daily Portugal deaths to current Daily Swedish deaths is 85 to 7.
1153,Same population for both countries.
1154,In the long run Sweden will have fewer total covid deaths...unless Portugal receives a vaccine in the next 2 months.
1155,If OP intended to gloat it is poor form with misleading data.
1156,"&gt; This is the argument that, if it were true, would apply to publishers as well."
1157,This is the bullshit claim I've been arguing against this whole time.

1159,You’ve claimed you understand that.
1160,Clearly you do not.

1162,"&gt; A publisher who says ""I won't publish your hateful Nazi drivel."""
1163,is not harming discourse.
1164,It could be argued that it is.
1165,Allowing distasteful topics to be discussed allows one to better their ability to properly argue against those bad ideas.

1167,You keep saying things “should” be a certain way when they aren’t.
1168,You keep going in circles without paying attention to what I’ve been trying to explain to you.
1169,&gt; I'm saying that Youtube ought to disallow them from using their service.
1170,"And you are wrong for saying that because that turns youtube into a publisher, not a platform, making them liable for the content on their platform, and are now subject to laws they weren’t before."
1171,"You clearly have no understanding of how the law applies to them, OR, you just don’t care, in which case you are arguing in bad faith."
1172,&gt; Your whole line of reasoning is a long string of mental hoops to jump through in order to justify propaganda.

1203,"So basically the research lumps a bunch of things, including locked down, together as one variable A, the “stringent index,” like all scientists agree on how that is computed, and claims that this variable is correlated with another lumped variable B, which is computed from a bunch of variables (using PCA), which then claims that B is not correlated with death rate C lumped over a period of time."
1204,"Not to mention that PCA works well if that bunch of variables are multivariate Gaussians, which is most likely not true in this case."
1205,Further research is needed.

1208,[The Imperial College](https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20201030/covid-19-infection-fatality-ratio-is-about-one-point-15-percent) did estimate it around there recently for high income countries.

1356,Sounds very pushy like someone trying to get you to try drugs
1357,So the foreign country can maintain the required number of people vaccinated at all times in all locations to prevent resurgence of diseases they've defeated.
1358,Also for personal protection within the herd.
1359,I never said vaccines don't protect you.
1360,They protect you if enough other people got them too.
1361,I thought it was that bone in my leg?
1362,&gt;	was to let it spread.
1363,This was not the strategy.
1364,&gt;	social distancing and safe vaccination rollout.
1365,This was the strategy.
1366,People usually mistake the lack of legally mandated lockdowns as a sign of the so-called “herd immunity strategy”.
1367,However this is probably just a quirk of the Swedish constitution and the Swedish way of doing things: *individual responsibility* as opposed to authority figures barking orders.
1368,"But focusing on the means makes you miss the intent, which was: Slow down spread as much as possible (with the available means) and wait for vaccines, or learn to live with the disease if vaccines fail to arrive."

1382,"For the actual numbers 

Poland's 7 day moving average = 495 deaths/day (and rapidly going up)

US 7 day moving average = 1657 deaths/day 

Poland's deaths if poland has the same size pop as the US would be 4272 deaths/day 

So currently Poland's death rate is 2.6X that of the US."

1387,"Another tragedy is that thousands of these deaths could be avoided if not for the intentional White House campaign to hide information about the virus fatality or the let it infect ""democratic"" cities, and probably they won't face any consequences."
1388,There's many reasons.
1389,It's just that reddit as a whole doesn't give one fuck about the market until they can use it to score some points dunking on capitalism.
1390,"First and foremost, the companies represented in the stock market are not representative of ""Main Street"" USA."
1391,They are generally large multinational corporations.
1392,And they benefited immensely from the pandemic.
1393,"While your smaller stores got shut down, places like walmart and home depot and target were left open due to a nebulous designation as essential."
1394,So that helped the retail side of the market.
1395,Another good portion is tech.
1396,Tech has done well during covid as well.
1397,"Everybody staying home and browing FB, Snap, Netflix, DIS + etc."
1398,Even hardware manufactures did well.
1399,"Many people, contrary to what reddit thinks, actually had more disposable income throughout the summer."

1521,But having millions of people going through that is worse than having the final death tally a few thousand higher.
1522,If you didn't agree you should be for locking everyone at home with the army distributing food and water as that would minimize Covid death count.

1527,In a normal year they wouldn’t kick you out over Thanksgiving because you’d be returning to classes.
1528,But this year most universities are ending the in-person semester before Thanksgiving—including closing dorms and reducing or eliminating dining hall service.
1529,Anyone living in campus sponsored housing at UVA for example has to declare whether they need in-person housing for winter and cannot return if they go home for Thanksgiving.
1530,"International students get especially fucked because most of the school sponsored services (Student Health, dining halls, cleaning services, libraries, rec facilities) all close/severely limit hours during breaks."
1531,While some might argue these kids should just stay inside their dorms—it’s hard to live in a single bedroom with no food or space to exercise for 3 months.
1532,And that’s what they are looking at.
1533,"So they’re likely to go home with friends if they can over the break, increasing the travel

Edit: Also UVA is making first year students move dorms if they want to stay on Grounds during winter."
1534,"So they have to pack up their shit from their first semester dorm, move across campus, then move back for second semester."

1549,"For months we have been told that ""herd immunity"" is not an ""on/off switch"" and that the effects of herd immunity can be seen long before the usually cited thresholds had been reached."
1550,"For example:

&gt; He instead seems to be brainstorming ways to explain to the public that you don't need to have full herd immunity – which requires 60 percent to 70 percent of the population to have been infected or vaccinated – for partial immunity to have an effect on the rate of spread."
1551,"&gt;  
&gt;""**Surely it has to be the case that as immunity rises in the population, the rate of spread of the disease decreases**,"" Tegnell wrote in the email to Giesecke on March 19th."

For months, the argument has been that even though Sweden has not reached the usual threshold, herd immunity is already playing a role, and was largely responsible for the end of the first wave."
1555,"&gt; “What we see right now is a rapid fall in the number of cases, and of course some kind of immunity has to be involved in that as nothing else has changed."

1718,"That is not so much longer than we have now, but the fact that many more people have been willing to take part in a trial for a vaccine against a worldwide pandemic (shocking for you to hear perhaps) and a focus of the global medical community on this issue means that much more research can be done in parallel, stages have been condensed to some degree but that doesn't mean the overall process has lower standards."

1987,It becomes a problem because one of the key aspects of a test/control is that the groups are balanced/randominzed beforehand so that you know the observed difference is due to the thing being studied.
1988,When that assumption gets invalidated everything becomes messy.
1989,It's like comparing the number of people that drown and you look at one group during the winter that took a swim and water safety class while the other group was studied during the summer and didn't take the class.
1990,Now you can't tell what causes the difference.

2151,Doubly so if you are already working for a different employer and aren't 'hungry' so to speak.
2152,I'm not saying you can walk in and stomp all over the recruiter but if it really makes your life easier to not work on Wednesdays or never start before 10AM or whatever it's best to have those discussions before beginning and have it down in writing.

2189,"But the point of my comment was not to deny covid (I'm quite opposite), but to point out that covid is even more deadly then it is reported by government - you have about 1000 deaths daily right now (we have to resort to looking at GUS data, not official government one because they started lying in them, e.g."
2190,under reporting detected cases) - they can't cheat death.
2191,BTW.
2192,"Reporting death is also not an easy thing to do in Poland, you can't move the body until a doctor arrives and reports it as death."
2193,My family had to wait over 12 hours for doctor to arrive (and it was in summer when we had much much fewer cases).
2194,My mom bought a 16 pound turkey because that’s what she always gets.
2195,Except this year there’s 5 of us instead of 15.
2196,And none of us even like turkey.
2197,Irrational?
2198,"Sure, but who cares."
2199,I’m sure she’s not alone
2200,That is 100 mil people ?
2201,I'm losing my mind .
2202,My coworker is hosting Thanksgiving including her friend who just got diagnosed with covid last week.
2203,Knows she has this virus and says she believes only people with medical issues get the virus or have any problems with it.
2204,Her reasoning is that she knows of five couples that live together while only one of each couple got infected.
2205,I've no idea how this happened.
2206,The spread is so random it seems.
2207,The reason I'm really going crazy is because she's saying stuff like she wants to get her covid friend a cupcake because she doesn't want her to blow her breath on a cake.
2208,It's too much.
2209,It's assinine.
2210,Am I over reacting?
2211,The stress is overwhelming me.
2212,She sits in the next cubicle and we aren't required to wear masks at our desks.
2213,The world is burning.
2214,Why are people going to such places anyway?
2215,I don’t trust them about anything if they make a 50% error in the dose given to thousands.
2216,What else did they botch?
2217,case counting right now is a little misleading and honestly annoying.
2218,"everyone is getting tested in advance of the holiday (whether you think that’s a good idea or not)

2220,There are currently freezer trucks backlogged with COVID bodies in nearly every single state right NOW.
2221,"Well, the public media dont report that."
2222,"The Ministry of Health ""lost"" 20.000 cases some days ago... Daily."
2223,So it webt down from 30.000 to 15.000 in a few days.
2224,Test pool dropped from 70k to 30-40k daily.
2225,And its only the tip of the iceberg here xD
2226,"What worries me is that in the future, this could happen:

1."
2227,The government could realise that WFH is bad for the economy as it is now.
2228,"(ie, less people buying lunch, coffee, using public transport, less companies paying for office space, etc) and they could start offering incentives to make companies have their employees go back to work in person
2."
2229,"The companies could think ""okay, so, everything is set up so that they are all working from home smoothly... Would it really matter if my next hire were from..."
2230,"overseas?"""
2231,National mask mandate.
2232,Jail and fines if you refuse.
2233,"You can refuse to wear masks, scream about your freedumbs, and give us a laundry list of reasons you don't want to wear one."
2234,All from the backseat of a police car.
2235,"I mean, I’m all for less contact..."
2236,But didn’t Fauci go to a Baseball game earlier this year?
2237,"&gt;whatever held the spread in summer, is not holding it anymore :-(

2242,"If you’re young, you statistically have no reason to suspect you’ll be one of the unfortunate outliers."

2264,"My sister is a teacher in our hometown, and had to take a leave of absence when the district decided to go back to the classroom full time."
2265,Even with the numbers rising.
2266,Meanwhile in my city all but the ESL and special needs teachers got to stay at home to teach.
2267,Masks for everyone in the school buildings are required.
2268,And the city invested in industrial air purifiers for each classroom for when/if the kids go back to a hybrid school year.
2269,Currently delayed- again- until Jan 4th.
2270,But I am guessing it will be longer.
2271,But the Gov is pushing for ALL schools to be back to in classroom learning full time ASAP.
2272,"yea, but if government officials (ie, Denver mayor Hancock) can travel for thanksgiving why can't we?"
2273,That’s because a significant portion of this sub is comprised of dejected teenagers who have fallen out with their families.
2274,A lot of them can’t grasp a healthy relationship because they probably don’t *have* many.
2275,I think the opposite can be argued.
2276,The issue is the response to the pandemic wasn't made political.
2277,"An effective politicized response would include paying everyone to stay home, an eviction moratorium coupled with rent cancellation, free PPE, and a decommodification of health services."

2316,I live 8 hours away from my family and the holidays are usually the only time I get to see them.

2321,The virus is bad enough without lying or exaggerating.
2322,The fact remains that the vast majority of people will not die or have complications of any kind due to covid.
2323,Should it still be taken seriously?
2324,"Yes, but the truth is a better tool for that than sensationalism or dubious claims."
2325,I don't think that's too much to ask.
2326,The issue with that is he's been a pretty good mayor otherwise
2327,Apparently doesn't care if it is many orders of magnitude safer than getting infected by the virus.

2333,"I mean, how is anyone going to take your travel warning seriously if you just broke your own rule 30 minutes after that warning."
2334,Being anti-vaxx because you think vaccines cause autism without any scientific basis is pretty different from being reluctant to take a new untested vaccine that is the first of its type.
2335,Ok. What are the percentages of participants per pain severity level?
2336,"Oh yes, all the doctors get lots of Covid points for each Corona death they count."
2337,You can see them on their lunch breaks comparing the size of their Covid coin pouches.
2338,That would be against one of the Joint Commission standards for hospital accreditation.
2339,"“Standard IC.02.04.01 does not mandate influenza vaccination for licensed independent practitioners and staff as a condition of Joint Commission accreditation.”

This standard specifically applies to influenza vaccinations for hospital employees."
2340,The Joint Commission could impose a Covid vaccination mandate but I have not seen any publications in regards to that.
2341,🏅🏅🏅
2342,I think the challenge with this particular issue is the experts totally reversed course.
2343,They went from adamantly being against masks to claiming they were essential with very little evidence.
2344,It casts a lot of doubt on their overall truthfulness.
2345,"Regardless, masks aren’t a big negative and aren’t something I fight about."
2346,"Something like closing schools, which has huge negatives, requires way more justification."
2347,But masks don’t really hurt and even if the only positive they provide is making people feel more protected I’m mostly fine with it.
2348,That's their choice but they should also sign a waiver form that they decline ambulance and a hospital bed.
2349,"First to clear the air, the few times I leave the house, I always mask up and wish there was a nationwide mask mandate."
2350,"Second, as I mentioned; it definitely could have been handled better, I am not justifying his behavior."

2352,"Basically, the story isn't that interesting to me."
2353,Without that title I wouldn't have wasted my time reading it.
2354,"It will be mid-December before we see the impact, Thanksgiving cause a delay in reporting."
2355,"From [Daily COVID-19 Data Is About to Get Weird](https://covidtracking.com/blog/daily-covid-19-data-is-about-to-get-weird/)""First, by Thanksgiving Day and perhaps as early as Wednesday, all three metrics will flatten out or drop, probably for several days."
2356,This decrease will make it look like things are getting better at the national level.
2357,"Then, in the week following the holiday, our test, case, and death numbers will spike, which will look like a confirmation that Thanksgiving is causing outbreaks to worsen."
2358,"But neither of these expected movements in the data will necessarily mean anything about the state of the pandemic itself."""

2370,"The half initial dose provokes a lesser immune response, but the full dose provokes too much of a response."
2371,Because the immune system is 'overheated' with the full dose it provokes a regulatory T cell response to 'turn down the thermostat' and prevent damage to the body.
2372,In immunology more is not always better.
2373,In the case of covid this can be seen in the benefit of corticosteroids in some acute cases.
2374,These suppress an 'overzealous' immune response that can kill the patient.
2375,I fail to grasp how presenting the viral antigens with two different carriers would result in a more benign initial response.

2504,"There’s nothing to explain, really."
2505,It seems many here believe these people “don’t understand” or something.
2506,Have you all considered that they fully understand the risks of Covid yet STILL do not want the government mandating things because they do not believe the government should have that power?
2507,So how do you explain that away?

Very rough theory behind the fear and removing it with evidence-based therapy is that your body believes that it's bad, and if it is able to actually get repeated evidence that it's not \[so bad\] in a short timeframe, it will learn and remove the fear."

2825,"Another 10% or something in January (because they'll be almost twice as much time in the month as in December) production ramps up and it's 13% or something in February, etc and so on."
2826,That's already approaching 3 in every 10 people having it.
2827,"At what point does the phrase ""general public"" not really matter much?"
2828,"By the time 80 million people have been vaccinated, everything is just going to be open."
2829,My wife and I are at the age to start thinking about when we want to have kids.
2830,Our first thought when people were joking about baby boom was do we really want to be in the hospital for prenatal care and delivery during a pandemic and then not be able to have our parents around to meet the baby and help out a bit?
2831,Add to that the stress and depression associated with the pandemic and feeling isolated from the community and all talk about having a baby kind of stopped when it became clear the virus wasn't going anywhere until at least 2021.
2832,Well you could always go to university.
2833,Its not too late I assume for you.
2834,Just don't take on more student debt than you can pay off
2835,That is an insane statistic.
2836,Tell your brother I hope his marriage fails.
2837,This is moving.
2838,These nurses and doctors and social workers are barely keeping it together.
2839,Newsweek strikes again
2840,I don't understand why more people aren't saying this.
2841,The first amendment has limits.
2842,"This is well into shouting ""Fire!"""
2843,in a crowded theatre territory.
2844,We have laws against libel and sedition on the books that are more than enough to deal with this.
2845,"""There are dozens of us!"""
2846,"DOZENS!"""
2847,What fake cure?
2848,There was a „cure“ article linked right here in this sub from a hospital.
2849,Something about an interactions of proteins causing the dangerous inflammation that kills people.
2850,And how it’s cured with an already existing medicament.
2851,This is nothing like what happened in 2008.
2852,The people buying houses are able to afford the payments.
2853,I may be biased but as a person living in the US where the government is buying all the doses I don’t think the difference of $2.50 vs $40 is a concern when you’re thinking of 60-70% vs 95% efficacy.
2854,You’re going to want something that protects your health as close to 100% as possible and having to pay an additional $37.50 I think is well worth it.
2855,You can’t even but a video game with $37.50.
2856,Additionally with the potential number of people that in America that are electing not to get vaccinated you’re going to want to go with giving as many people the 95% solution as possible.
2857,You don’t want that 30% chance out there of someone encountering the disease getting sick and spreading it.
2858,"I know folks who went to the protests and not only did they wear masks, but they quarantined and got tested afterwards."
2859,Turns out people who protest social issues have a social conscience.
2860,Go figure.
2861,I'm genuinely starting to think having anxiety is just being a realist (when anxious about things that could actually happen at least).
2862,"Yep, fucked up that that’s such a common sentiment"
2863,Your are an antivaxxer
2864,[removed]
2865,"Exactly, this is why masks aren't enough to stop case growth in the US and Europe- reducing the number of close contacts seems to be far more effective."
2866,Hk never truly locked down.
2867,For example the most restaurants closed was 2 days.
2868,No matter what we have been able to work and shop.
2869,They don’t have mandatory testing.
2870,The gov keeps messing up with the quarantine regulations and then blaming it on the public.
2871,Gave them an excuse to cancel the elections.
2872,"Yes, I think that’s the point they were making."
2873,And why is anyone listening to someone who made people eat bugs for money on national tv?
2874,I think they have secured some.
2875,It's getting the general public vaccinated may take longer.
2876,The Chronic Fatigue Community welcomes you.
2877,Wow.
2878,Your insolence is mind-boggling.
2879,"You're obviously stuck in your own safe perspective instead of seeing the over-whelmed hospitals or the fact that 238,000 people have died because we chose to ignore it."
2880,"Kill more people if you want, but I choose to respect other's lives and well-being instead of being ignorant."
2881,People weren't this stupid during the Spanish Flu and it gradually went away.
2882,"Ignoring it is exacerbating it, and its frustrating that it's continuing, thanks for making it continue longer than it should."
2883,Not going to argue with someone who's so stuck in their own world.
2884,My local hospital canceled elective surgeries a couple weeks ago.
2885,They have zero beds available right now.
2886,"What should a hospital do in that case, restart surgery when ten percent of the staff is in quarantine, there's no beds, and the emergency room is functioning as an icu?"
2887,This is why the Senate majority refuses to pass a stimulus deal.
2888,They want blanket immunity for businesses from lawsuits like this and the other side isn't willing to budge.
2889,"Think about that...millions of Americans out of work, suffering, starving, being evicted and they will get no help because a certain group wants to protect asshole business owners from legal liability."
2890,If 70% of people wore masks INDOOR (excepts when you're at home) then it's very probable that it would stop the pandemic.
2891,A lot of European countries have tried mask wearing outdoor and it didn't work.
2892,In Iran I guess more than 70% of people wear masks when outdoor.
2893,"It's maybe 90% in metro, banks and closed governmental offices but it again didn't stop this horrific current wave."
2894,Why?
2895,"Because people still visit their friends and family indoor, then magically everybody assumes they are in a safe territory and take off their masks."
2896,This and many other stories like it that are emerging are extremely worrisome to read about but I must ask...
2897,These articles never provide context regarding hospital capacity and ICU availability during a “normal” year.
2898,Is this alarming situation the first time it has ever happened?
2899,Are hospitals used to seeing major surges from time to time for various reasons?
2900,I can remember when my grandmother needed urgent care a few years ago we were told there were no ICU beds available and we had to transfer her to a hospital 150 miles away.
2901,(We live in a major US metro area) This was 2017 and I think it was due to an influenza epidemic that year.
2902,Nowhere near the US.
2903,We’re number one!
2904,"Even if we get to an average of 200k a day, and assuming testing is missing 4-5x, a million a day, is still many months before we start hitting even optimistic estimates of heard immunity, and most of a year before total coverage."
2905,Thats not really cool.
2906,Do you just gotta get together for Thanks Giving this year?
2907,Then don't complain about an ICU Christmas.
2908,"The phx area had a 400 team soccer tournament last weekend, as well as other organized sports events."
2909,"Mask compliance, from my observations, is down from where it was (should be) when the summer spike got turned around."
2910,"I’m basically sheltering in place, avoiding public exposure as much as possible."
2911,I am suspecting one one hand we will have many anti-maskers who will claim that they have been vaccinated and therefore can go without a mask-- despite lying about the vaccination to begin with.
2912,"On the other hand, we will have people who are vaccinated and very angry that they cannot go without masks."
2913,"On the gripping hand^(1), people like me will get vaccinated and continue to wear masks until People Smarter Than Me say it's fine to go without."
2914,^(1) [^(The Gripping Hand)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gripping_Hand) ^(is a reference to a science fiction novel by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle.)

2922,What?
2923,They said this in like June.
2924,And the quarantine requirement that came with that was an absolute joke that nobody followed.
2925,So... zombies

2928,"I can’t tell you whether you should go, but here are the things you would be contending with:

Potential reinfection of your parents."
2929,This is really unlikely.
2930,"There have been cases of reinfection reported, but they are pretty darn rare."
2931,"If they and you have been isolating/minimizing sources of exposure to the virus, it’s even less likely."
2932,It’s not zero.
2933,But the risk to them seems pretty low.
2934,Potential for you or your brother to become sick.
2935,Anyone who has been immunized (via vaccine or recovery from the virus) could still be exposed to the virus and transmit it to another person.
2936,This is also low risk because an immunized individual would carry less virus for less time.
2937,But it’s not zero.
2938,It's the will of god.
2939,It's so fking stupid.
2940,This is false.
2941,Parking mitary bases in countries the USA hasn't fought in since ww2 isn't paying for their health care.

3049,This whole thing has revealed a ton about the US and Americans.
3050,All of it bad.
3051,It's sad.
3052,I honestly view about 50% of Americans as evil horrible monsters.
3053,And as such I need to keep an eye over my shoulder from now on.
3054,What’s the easy fix?
3055,I’ve been using some cloth masks from Amazon and they’ve been working great.
3056,But I’ve run into the same problem while exercising where the mask is being sucked inward (and making it hard to breathe).
3057,"No tests, no virus /s."
3058,I'm with you.
3059,I told my wife I'll be first in line whenever Its available.
3060,What if I'm in a a group that isn't prioritized for the vaccine?
3061,I mean if there are only 100mil doses available that means we have to decide who gets it first.
3062,"Ok so that's first responders, medical staff, and the elderly."
3063,That's fair but does that mean everyone else who hasn't had the option to take the vaccine can't fly?
3064,Who is claiming permanent immunity?
3065,There seems to be a consensus that most people have immunity for at least a few months.

3122,"Sure, all things being equal you'd take the most efficacious vaccine you can, especially if you aren't paying for it yourself."

3139,I know Stanford has been working on this just not with a mRNA approach....
3140,You're thinking of the BioNTech-pfizer (-70C).
3141,The  Moderna vaccine can be stored at -20C and the Oxford-AstroZeneca can be stored in a normal fridge.
3142,So if you use the Oxford vaccine you can transport it with normal refrigerated trucks.

3481,They only report Tuesday to Friday now.
3482,"Tuesday they reported 94 new deaths, but backdated them, so when you see daily deaths, Sweden has like 11 for that day if you looked Tuesday."
3483,"When you look again two weeks from now, Tuesday 24."
3484,"November will have jumped, so you definitely cannot compare day to day with Sweden on a particular day unless it is more than 2 weeks ago."
3485,I feel sorry for you
3486,"I apologize for the confusion, I was never trying to say that vaccines are not necessary, period."

3504,How is it more than 50 percent?
3505,Can't read the article as it needs to sign in.. test positivity rate is coming back 10-15 percent and only some PPL are actually getting tested.
3506,If the odds are 50 percent then you have a big dining table for sure

3722,"Yes, where does it all come from...

1 - It appears from several internal email dialogues from March-April that has become public, that Anders Tegnell and Johan Giesecke (who was hired as a consultant to help w the strategy) saw many benefits from a herd immunity-strategy."
3723,2 - It even appears in one mail that Tegnell clearly states they have chosen the strategy of herd immunity because they didn’t see lockdown and TTI as realistic alternatives.
3724,"3 - Tegnell praised Britains herd immunity strategy, just days before they scrapped it."
3725,He said it was similar to Sweden’s and more scientific than other strategies.
3726,4 - Swedish authorities has been careful to always talk about “flattening the curve” with the explicit goal of achieving a slow spread so hospitals are not overloaded.
3727,They have never talked about minimizing or eradicating the spread to avoid people get ill and die as much as possible.
3728,5 - Sweden has done relatively very little to surpress the spread.
3729,"Authorities have even argued against and actively hindered several preventivt measures: Masks, broad testing, pro contact tracing, tougher restrictions on bars and crowd sizes, isolation of asymptomatic close contacts and any kind of measures on schools."
3730,"6 - Swedish authorities and the experts they cooperate with has again and again announced herd immunity would be just around the corner in April, may, June, July."
3731,Every time it has turned out to be an over optimistic claim without any hard evidence to back it up.
3732,"7 - Swedish authorities has repeatedly claimed that the high level of immunity achieved in Sweden would be of great benefit later on, and claimed we would do much better than Norway, Finland and Denmark during this autumn and winter because of it."
3733,"8 - The leader of the Christian Democrat opposition party has said that “In our discussions with the Prime Minister and the heads of the authorities, it has sounded as if there are great benefits to the strategy Sweden has chosen, because we would have a much higher degree of immunity as a result of having a higher degree of spread of infection.”

&amp;#x200B;

In contrast the only argument you’ll ever hear against this is that Tegnell has denied that herd immunity is the strategy."
3734,It’s just a beneficial side effect.
3735,The strategy is to flatten the curve.

3756,"Are they making inpatients wear them all the time too, even when they’re sleeping?"
3757,That is impressive and maybe hard to reproduce but there were many things that we could have done in Europe but didn't for no good reason.
3758,* We shouldn't have gone skiing right next to the outbreak in Italy.
3759,* We shouldn't have allowed people to leave the area with the outbreak in Italy.
3760,* Our governments shouldn't have lied about masks not working to have more left for hospital staf.
3761,Instead they should have encouraged self made masks.
3762,* The lockdowns should have happened earlier.
3763,* The lockdowns should have lasted until there were no new cases for 2weeks like in Wuhan.
3764,* The contact tracing should have had more people and they should have been more persistent.
3765,* Testing should have been given more resources and efforts so more people could have been tested.
3766,* We shouldn't have gone on vacations in summer to other countries.
3767,* The second lockdown should have happened sooner.

3795,I do support restricting their ability to enter public facilities such as schools as a consequence of their actions or if a company wanted to refuse entry to people who have not been vaccinated but hell no to forcing something into someone's body against their will.

3857,My boyfriend said almost nobody had a mask on or even around their necks when he had to go inside for the bathroom.
3858,"When we would pass people on the trails while we were hiking we’d pull up our masks (more of a courtesy since we couldn’t distance, and something we’d been doing the entire time in boulder) and the people passing would just roll their eyes."

3877,"If there's one thing this pandemic has shown, it is the failure of the pay for use system."
3878,"If individuals pay for their own, poor people won't be able to pay."
3879,Since they are the most likely to get infected (living conditions) and won't know if they are (bc not tested) the risk of the disease spreading is higher.

3953,“Many studies have documented evidence of negative interference between viruses caused by short-lived (days) protection elicited from the first infection.
3954,"Host antiviral interferon responses are often regarded as the main mechanism by which interference manifests; that is, as a result of a recent infection, the host cells up-regulate the synthesis of interferons, potentially inhibiting a secondary infection."
3955,"Even though it is short-lived, this effect can be strong at population scales and temporarily reduce the prevalence of a virus or shift the timing of its circulation."

4093,"There’s exceptions, and it’s not to say things could get worse by a holidays or things like that."
4094,But right now based on human mitigation these states are all trending in a better direction
4095,one argument for this i read in the past is that essential workers like those in grocery stores are necessarily at higher risk of getting and **spreading** covid19.
4096,"I have also read some argued for vaccinating the young, healthy that are most likely spreading this the most after doing medical workers &amp; people in nursing homes to stop them from spreading."
4097,as someone lower down the list myself I'm good with essential workers coming before me for their own sake and the rest of us around them too.

4122,"If I remember correctly from back in July/August, it was taking something like 25-28 days roughly to see the resultant spike in deaths."
4123,So it appears we may be getting *slightly* faster at reporting but not by much.

4163,And it's pretty fucking weird that people are out and about on here shitting on people for have a healthy and reasonable amount of skepticism.

4180,"Because the vaccine is designed, studied and given under highly controlled settings, in which every patient and control person is studied before, during and after."
4181,"This is a very different, ‘knowable’ situation compared to the entire virus (which is larger than the vaccine fragment) acting freely throughout the entire community."
4182,We actually can say that you are extremely likely to be immune for at least a few months.
4183,"Beyond that, we cannot say with scientific certainty how long your 99% will last."
4184,And we also don’t know if your immunity right now is really 99% or there are undetected reinfections walking around with mild cases so your present immunity is more like 95%... maybe even possibly 90%.

4194,Just because they deplatform radical conspiracy theory nuts doesn't mean they'll also start censoring conservative voices.
4195,And if there's really too little daylight between the crazies and mainstream conservatives that they get nervous about that then maybe they should do some self reflection rather than asking private companies to be nicer to them.

4208,Good lord it was just a comment on the article.
4209,Not trying to analyze every scenario.
4210,&gt; I don't have the impression you have any interest at in starting a dialogue and I won't get pissed off because you call me an 'ignorant' (is that welcome in this thread?
4211,I can see you've edited your comment but you said what you said.
4212,"If this is wrong enough to change it, I guess the honest thing would have been to apologize too) but I won't accept any kind of threats."
4213,What?
4214,I haven't edited any of my comments.
4215,Not did I call you an ignorant.
4216,I did say your comments on saying a company wouldn't report negative data shows your lack of knowledge in this area.
4217,"It's not a ""threat""."
4218,You're talking to one of the people who run this sub.
4219,I'm warning you of the rules so you don't end up banned or have removed comments.
4220,You're welcome to whatever theories you'd like.
4221,I obviously disagree with them because they aren't rooted in any evidence or fact.
4222,But if you glide into misinformation and anti-vax language then you'll end up banned.
4223,Where are you guys drawing the line these days?
4224,"Would I be banned for suggesting that systematically defunding state and local governments through tax cuts, as many of these places do, leaves them unable to cope with crises like COVID?"
4225,&gt;Though they're pretty demonic too.
4226,I thought the politically correct term was mortally challenged?
4227,Most people comply with the law.
4228,Most men are not draft dodgers and those that do are certainly not admired.
4229,The consequences are pretty serious as well.
4230,"Most people pay their taxes, while they may try to legally avoid tax, tax evasion is a crime that can really destroy lives or businesses."
4231,"Driving without a drivers license lands a lot of people in court, their car towed and impounded for 30 or 60 days."
4232,The idea that most people flout most laws is childish at best and basically and literally criminal at worst.
4233,You must need help with basic comprehension skills.
4234,In no way shape or form did I say I was against vaccinations?
4235,"However, I am a bit hesitant to put 💯 faith in my government and science community when it comes to a brand new vaccination that  can directly impact our economy."
4236,Our government has already showed us they value the economy more than human life.
4237,They have not been truthful with us.
4238,The CDC contradicts themselves every other month.
4239,"I honestly think people who would go into this blindly and not question it it is “Time to take the tin foil off.”  Unfortunately, science has become politicized and I feel the CDC is listening too much to the White House that it is hard for me to believe what comes out of their mouths"
4240,He likely already committed assault by rushing with a raised arm.
4241,He should have been arrested for that.
4242,I think Wisconsin did better than Iowa or Indiana because neither of those states wanted to do any kind of restrictions.
4243,"By the time Pitzker shut down Illinois it was already hitting Chicago hard, and let's face it, the higher the apartment buildings the wicke quicker the spread."
4244,"Iirc the Twin Cities had it going bad for a while, too."
4245,"Evers did his best but he was shut down by the legislature and the other punch is that when you opened back up everyone who was sick of the restrictions who lived within 50 miles of you from Illinois, Minnesota, and Michigan came to party with you with no masks."
4246,"The people who thought it was okay to do that weren't exactly the types to be taking it seriously in the first place, so I'm sure that's how a lot of your cases got in."
4247,When you look at Illinois' second and third wave it starts around the borders and moves in because we're surrounded by lax/no restrictions and anyone close to a border who wanted to go to a bar did it.
4248,"Fair enough, but as far as I know, not one state has stopped dining and drinking...

Kind of a gaping chasm if you ask me"
4249,Seems like some people can't handle a reality where there are people who want to wear masks.

4254,It might be a touch extreme to say it doesn’t spread outdoors at all.
4255,"But yes, the guidance is pretty clear outdoors is much lower risk than indoors."
4256,This is where I'm headed as well.
4257,"I'm a realist, I want to be vaccinated but I also realize that Murphy's law is real and the vaccine rollout probably won't be as quick or efficient as planned."
4258,If I get vaccinated by July I'll consider it a win.
4259,Do you drive or otherwise leave your house?
4260,Taxes paid for those roads.
4261,"Do you have kids or family members who attended public schools, or did you?"
4262,Taxes paid for those.
4263,Have you ever needed to use unemployment?
4264,Taxes paid for that.

4268,"I bet lots of people complained about the rationing and said it was a violation of their freedoms, but history books like to make things sound nicer than they really were."
4269,Testing is reaching a bottleneck.
4270,Keep your eye on test positivity rates and hospitalizations.
4271,"Then, look at excess deaths from the rear view mirror to see what really happened."
4272,I would do anything to get vaccinated before the new year.
4273,I have multiple high risk conditions and I am terrified of Covid.
4274,I know the medical staff needs it first but damn it I am eager to get vaccinated.
4275,I wish I were trolling.
4276,I have loved ones that would die if they got the flu.
4277,Children die every year from the flu and it's completely preventable.
4278,"What about wearing masks to prevent flu deaths seems like ""trolling"" to you?"
4279,Hi dad!
4280,I find it very interesting that you said vaccination S in a plural sense.
4281,So what other vaccinations do you feel are mandatory?
4282,The new ones to come?
4283,I love how you automatically condemn someone who does not want to get vaccinated as a person who makes poor decisions and lacks critical thinking.
4284,I live here.
4285,I was born and raised here but I've lived in other states and I can say with some authority that California is fucking awesome.
4286,I can tell you don't live here!
4287,"To be fair, COVID-19 has been a very boring pandemic."
4288,Like recording a car wreck on a high speed camera and then loading it into one of those slideshow picture frames.
4289,"It's always gruesome, but mostly it's just more of the same carnage."
4290,There have been numerous stories like this from around the midwest since the pandemic started.
4291,"Like I've seen in other posts the term ""nurse"" is a wide category from 1 year programs to 4 year programs and more."
4292,This ain’t science Bubb.
4293,"Did you mean quotation marks, or am I way off here?"
4294,I always take Ireland as an example.
4295,Ireland used to be covered in oak trees- the joke was that a squirrel could run from the northern to the southern tip of the island without touching the ground.
4296,"Then, the British came and cut down most of the trees."
4297,There were other factors but that was a big one.
4298,"So, the next generation of kids grew up with an Ireland that was lots of rolling green grassy hills."
4299,"Pretty, but totally different, ecologically speaking."
4300,Humans will just come into this world thinking whatever is going on is normal.
4301,They will hear tales of the way it used to be but the sad truth is that the only people that ever want to go back to the old ways are the people who never experienced them.
4302,"By the time the old ways are really gone, the people that knew them are by and large either dead or close to it."
4303,"""Protecting his woman"""
4304,It should have been obvious to everyone when antibody studies showed there wasn't a ridiculously low IFR and only a fraction of the worst hit places were infected in the spring wave.
4305,There's been no argument for herd Immunity since May.
4306,I've been following along with everyone else and am only hearing about the vaccine being 2 shots from this article for some reason.
4307,This is going to deter A Lot more people from getting the vaccine than if it was a one and done shot.
4308,"I'm getting it no questions asked, but know a lot of people that would not once they learn it's going to be two separate visits."
4309,This is not good.
4310,They forgot to reply :(
4311,"Wait I'm curious, is that how modern day Americans perceive the Pacific War?"
4312,Because nobody's mentioning the atrocities of the Japanese Empire.
4313,"And we totally know how ""persuadable"" those guys were at the time."
4314,Yeah diplomacy could absolutely have worked when they were planning to die to a man to defend their mainland.
4315,"In Germany, we're currently having more deaths because moronic anti-maskers."
4316,"At least 2850 deaths could have been avoided in Autumn, that's 20 % of the total."
4317,"14,866 deaths (now) in Germany equal 1853 deaths in Sweden."
4318,12000 deaths in Germany equal 1495 deaths in Sweden.
4319,"Sweden has 4.3 times the death of if we had avoided the second wave in if-we-were-smart Germany, and 3.5 times the death as stupid-as-is Germany."
4320,"If we were like Sweden, Germany would have 52147 deaths by now."
4321,"It's not only death, it's also the suffering of those who survive."
4322,My parents were born at the tail end of ww2.
4323,The most interesting thing my mother ever told me about her childhood was that there were barely any men in her life.
4324,So many men died that families became households of widowed wives raising their kids together.
4325,She just told be this casually like it was normal.
4326,"Young, children right now will tell their kids how there was no grandparents when they were children."
4327,All they can recall of their grandparents was seeing old people on facetime/zoom once a month/week until they last saw them with doctors and nurses.
4328,This is not acceptable.
4329,It will likely be drive through shots... at least for a while.
4330,"That’s the way I had my first test back in April, never got out of the car and everyone administering the test was thoroughly masked."
4331,The fat that one or more of them had it already proves this was a lie.
4332,Aye the gloves are off now.
4333,Except your math is wrong.
4334,"260,000 of 13,000,000 is not .02%, its .02 or 2%."
4335,"My mask has dinosaurs on it, im not going to stop wearing it until im forced to."
4336,"Also, as someone with some medical issues, I use public restrooms frequently and masks are a great help."
4337,So the comparison with oann is apt.
4338,So now it suddently matters?
4339,Seems like vaccine is just gonna arrive.
4340,Such big companies placing orders for cold storages makes us understand that vaccine are just gonna arrive anytime
4341,We are just starting to see the first round of vaccines.
4342,I suspect that both Pfizer and Moderna will continue to develop their vaccines to the point that they can be distributed through normal supply channels.
4343,I also suspect that we will move to a model like the flu vaccine where people receive an annual vaccine and it protects against multiple if not all corona viruses.
4344,"Of course, this is probably at least two years away."
4345,"Perhaps, and this is just wishful thinking on my part, with all the vaccine development going on we may finally see a vaccine for the common cold as well."
4346,It follows that with all the R&amp;D money spent drug companies will want to look for other ways to apply it.
4347,"As if, Illinois is broke."
4348,Aren't there emails that indicate he took part in the discussion on strategy?
4349,How this virus will spread like wildfire and lockdowns can only postpone the spread?
4350,"It's not particular about sports, but if we're talking about the schools' winter holidays, they are week 7,8 and 10 in Denmark."
4351,"That's not really different from Sweden, and people were returning home from southern Europe with Covid-19 symptoms already in the early Februar."

4354,Its right there.
4355,They require different schooling.
4356,One degree doesn’t qualify you to work in the other field.
4357,Respiratory therapy degrees have a much more narrow focus than nursing degrees.
4358,We get it.
4359,Y'all can give this played out joke a rest now 🙄
4360,Wrong.
4361,"This is the translated wording of the relevant part of his contract: 

”The assignment means that Johan Giesecke will support the unit for analysis in their work with modeling and analysis of Covid-19."
4362,The scope is a maximum of 800 hours in 2020.
4363,"The assignment is carried out with the professionalism, quality, competence and business acumen that can be expected of a senior expert.”

That is a very open job description."
4364,“To help with the strategy“ is a fair way to describe his contribution.
4365,"In contrast to “modelling” which is a specialised field in itself, usually reserved for people with a background in mathematics and programming."
4366,"We know that in May Giesecke sent the authorities a bill for a full months of work, that included talking to media."
4367,After this scandal his contract was terminated early.
4368,Furthermore it is highly unusual to write such an imprecise job description in a contract worth almost a million Swedish kronor.
4369,Are you on r/stopdrinking?
4370,Those dudes saved my life.
4371,I work in the health division of the organization and am working on educating other parts.

4375,It's understandable why people have given up trying to understand what's true.
4376,Perhaps both could be true as the science on Covid is continually evolving.
4377,I smile with my eyes while mouthing 'fuck off' in secret.
4378,"Gotcha, yeah self-demonetizing usually means that the channel has enough merit to stand on its own and that its creator is principled enough and loves the work enough to not want any money out of it."

4386,That’s terrible to say.
4387,Smh
4388,"No, the Moderna one is kept at a slightly higher temperature."
4389,There's confusion because we need to use different cold temperatures for different lengths of time.
4390,"The ultracold freezers are for longer term storage (e.g., six months)."
4391,"We're basically going to use them as fast as they can make it, though, so long term storage doesn't matter as much."
4392,They need something closer to regular freezer temps at the point of distribution.
4393,"What we'll see is central storage at ultra cold temps, shipments to your doctor's office in dry ice (which, frankly, shouldn't be that hard in the US, given that a premium steak company sends out 4M packages of frozen steaks in dry ice annually, mostly during the holidays), local storage in a regular freezer for a few days, defrost to fridge temps to be used up in 24 hours."
4394,Yeah that is the plan.
4395,But we are months away from that.

4399,"State officials have launched investigations into a coronavirus outbreak at a veterans nursing home in Illinois that has infected nearly 200 residents and staff members, and killed 27 veterans."
4400,News outlets reported Illinois Gov.
4401,J.B. Pritzker’s office and the state’s Department of Veteran’s Affairs are attempting to determine what caused the outbreak at the state-run LaSalle Veterans’ Home.
4402,"The department on Tuesday requested an independent probe into the facility, which was the focus of a state Senate committee virtual hearing on the outbreak."
4403,"“The tragedy of what has unfolded at the veterans’ home cannot be understated,” said State Senator Sue Rezin, who represents the district where the home is located."
4404,"“I’m glad that the director has called for an independent investigation and agree that there are lesson to be learned from this terrible outbreak that has claimed the lives of 27 of our nation’s heroes.”

The current outbreak was identified in late October when a staff member and a resident tested positive for the virus, the Chicago Tribune reported."
4405,The home was not largely impacted by the pandemic until then.
4406,"In fact, two-thirds of residents and employees tested positive since the beginning of this month, according to the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs."
4407,"“It is no coincidence that cases within the home began to rise just as cases rose dramatically within the surrounding community,” Veterans Affairs Director Linda Chapa LaVia testified Tuesday at the hearing."
4408,"Dr. Avery Hart, a consultant for the state’s Public Health department, said at the hearing that all 16 long-term care facilities in LaSalle County have had outbreaks."
4409,"State officials have increased staff testing at the facility, and the governor said an infection control team was sent to the home."
4410,"As of Tuesday morning, 40 residents and 24 staff members were positive for the virus."
4411,There are currently 101 residents at the home.
4412,"He knows people would not follow the rules for Christmas, and he knows that if you give people some freedom (the rule is up to 3 households can meet) they would be more likely to follow and the damage done less, than if the rules were stricter with no one abiding and chaos ensuing."
4413,The rule is only as successful as the people following it.
4414,I don't usually defend Boris Johnson but on this one he cannot do that much on his own.
4415,They remember hearing that this virus is super deadly and will ruin your life but they had it and feel fine.
4416,They must be losing their memory right
4417,Russia has an effective vaccine and still can't get COVID under control.
4418,Watch the video.
4419,He literally says that the goal is herd immunity through infection.
4420,"Well 2 of them have worked and is definitely the way to be doing things right now, but once the 3rd option becomes a reality the other 2 need to be relaxed."
4421,Me too.
4422,In the US everyone is talking about not having a family Thanksgiving.. but not going out on Black Friday?
4423,Unthinkable.
4424,Then why lie about what he did if it doesn't matter.
4425,Fake news again about Sweden.
4426,This sub sucks.
4427,This report is incorrect on this point.
4428,It doesn’t take the increased testing into account for this period.
4429,\*3. look at their data (and trend) on deaths but ignore the latest two weeks as the data is incomplete.
4430,You can't compare day to day anyway.
4431,The Sunday and  Monday reports are useless because of the weekend so you're comparing the quality of the paperwork.
4432,"Nope, they got different weeks on sports vacation"
4433,I know.
4434,Why can’t people just video chat?
4435,"You’d obviously *rather* see your loved ones in person, but many people I know live and work too far from their families to get together even in non-pandemic years."
4436,I had no idea there were so many families so close that they would rather get together than stay healthy.
4437,"Maybe my family is just unusual, however."
4438,Why have we seen so little public discussion of what a vaccine passport involves?
4439,"As much as I hate to say it, this actually looks like a decent application of the blockchain."
4440,Is it going to be a physical piece of paper?
4441,A digital version?
4442,Is there any standardization between vaccines/countries?
4443,How will they prevent forgeries?
4444,How will it be tied to an individual?
4445,How will they prevent you from borrowing someone else's?
4446,"What happens if you lose it, how do you get it replaced?"
4447,"Let's say a aged care home wants to establish a policy of no one being allowed in without a vaccine passport, what hardware do they need to buy?"
4448,How much longer does it take to enter the premise?
4449,What about after hours access?
4450,How does this work in a sporting arena?
4451,A nightclub?
4452,An airport?
4453,I feel like all of this should have been in the planning stages 6 months ago and we're going to find out in 3 months that none of it has been planned for at all.
4454,Lol who said I wear a mask.
4455,And the only abnormal thing here is the news telling us it's terrible.
4456,Still waiting for it all to happen.
4457,the people that need to go back to end of the line are all those who shun wearing masks and taking precautions.
4458,They should be the very last to have any treatment.
4459,I'd have that part of triage with a lie detector.
4460,"The red light goes on, out the door you go to the tent in the parking lot"
4461,"&gt;Sweden had 10% of its population outside of Sweden

So did Denmark"
4462,No.
4463,They will not believe in the consequences of their actions until they themselves are affected.
4464,Even then some will deny it on their deathbed.
4465,It is what has worked for us down here thus far.
4466,"I work in a lab that processes COVID tests, so I won’t be in the first wave but one of the ones after."
4467,They were saying we should have availability around late January to early February if we want it.

4481,"The 1st amendment is a legal protection from criminal prosecution by the government, but the concept of free speech is an idealogical position that extends far beyond the 1st amendment."
4482,"For instance, google, facebook, reddit, etc, do not believe in free speech."
4483,"Sites like 4chan do, to an extent."
4484,Lmao so many Reddit users who magically know more than literal PhDs and Fauci himself.
4485,"&gt; When projections said there would be 90,000 dead and that turned out to be closer to 5,000 I’d say that’s doing quite well

4490,My guess is summer 2021.
4491,"&gt; Because it's impossibly unlikely that Pfizer and Moderna cooked the books for this round, because they knew the FDA was going to spend 3 weeks scouring the test results."
4492,"Also Canadian government, British government, German government, etc, etc, etc."
4493,all of these very wealthy first world countries with the best scientists in the world.
4494,Ugh.
4495,Slammed.
4496,My heart absolutely goes out to you guys.
4497,You are at SUCH high risk.
4498,I keep myself sane by making sure my PPE is correct before going in with a patient.
4499,I hope that you have sufficient and properly-fitting PPE.
4500,I’m in the same boat with sleep—waking anxious after just a few hours and not able to get back to sleep.
4501,I’m so sorry and wish I could make it right for everyone being pushed to the brink.
4502,Will keep you in my thoughts!
4503,Where did you here that.
4504,"Facebook, Reddit?"
4505,3 - 4 months is enough for the virus to infect every the vast majority of people in the US if left unchecked.
4506,"In pandemic terms, 3-4 months is quite a bit of time."
4507,Where did you here that.
4508,"Facebook, Reddit?"
4509,"They were downvoted for implying that 20% is low, not for stating the fact."
4510,And the scientists who are creating these vaccines/overseeing trials probably have a pretty good idea as to what the FDA is looking for (safety first &amp; foremost then efficacy) and have already triple checked their work to make sure it's up to par.
4511,"Save the world, apparently."
4512,"So you were being condescending when you said:

&gt; I hope none of your staff or their loved ones lose their lives to Covid."
4513,Good to know you're among the legion self-righteous psychopaths here on Reddit wishing misery and death upon people they disagree with whilst trying to maintain a morally superior stance.
4514,There goes my no nut November attempt.
4515,This sub is full of shut-ins who want this to continue as long as possible because it's like a real-life movie to them and they secretly love all the ups/downs and the whole saga of it all.
4516,"They didn't have much going on before so their way of life hasn't really changed, if anything the pandemic has added drama to their lives."
4517,try to hide your inner racism a bit better
4518,I hope you are suggesting 1 of 3 and not all 3.
4519,Man.
4520,That will be enough to vaccinate every health care worker in the US.
4521,DeSantis in Florida did same thing earlier this fall forcing schools to reopen for in classroom teaching and then ordered all COVID info related to schools to be hidden from public view
4522,"I personally didn't think the Dakotas would ever get it bad at all on account of their low population density, but I guess they continue to disappoint."
4523,&gt; If your wife asks you if a dress makes her look bad do you say yes?
4524,Absolutely I will.

4527,"I'll rather be the guy who got her mildly inconvenienced by wardrobe change at home, than someone who didn't have the stones to save her from embarrassment later."
4528,"Also I much prefer her in clothes that look good on her, crazy innit."
4529,True that.
4530,Go ahead and make it mandatory  but also make sure you pay for your employees vaccination
4531,What about the rights of those of us don't want to be infected by someone who is unvaccinated?
4532,Why is the debate allways about the rights of the unvaccinated?
4533,I'm not disagreeing with that.
4534,"I'm trying to say that they are basically part of the same document, despite technically being an amendment."
4535,should not be any debate but we Americans love our freedoms to infect and kill others
4536,i definitely feel the need to drink it after seeing anything from OANN.
4537,Maybe if they got like full Hazmat suits perhaps i'm not compelty sure though however if that would work
4538,like asking way is Saturday night gang shootings always bad new
4539,"You are wrong, of course."
4540,Other countries such as Estonia had just as much vacationers in the Alps at that same time and brought back the virus at comparable ratios and Estonia was even leading Sweden in detected cases back in March - April.
4541,But now Sweden is 10x ahead of Estonia per capita.
4542,They are call Floridiots for a reason.
4543,University of Illinois-Champaign is testing students and staff twice a week with a test they developed that gives almost immediate results.
4544,"Its new rapid, saliva-based COVID test and I have no idea why this isn;t expanded nationwide."
4545,"oops I forgot, we have NO national plan"
4546,They will soon enough if they keep this current rate up.
4547,&gt; And (true story) the fucking heat went out on the car on Sunday.
4548,Car guy here.
4549,Please don't ignore that.
4550,"Cars are heated by running engine coolant through a tiny radiator in the dash, and blowing your air over that to heat it."
4551,"If your heat has stopped working that means you have a coolant leak somewhere, which could cause engine overheating, and a very expensive engine repair bill."
4552,It could also just be a blend door issue if you have electronic air blending knobs.
4553,"Unless you mean that the air just isn't blowing, which means your blower motor is out, which also sucks, but wouldn't be engine related."
4554,"But seriously, if your HVAC is blowing cold while on heat, and you don't hear a clicking/popping noise in the dash when switching between cold/hot, nip that shit in the bud before you have bigger issues."
4555,The people that don't care to wear masks are the types that don't leave any leftovers.
4556,"As well intended as it might be, this will be a partial interference to plans for getting the vaccine to the most vulnerable first."
4557,"Younger people a priori do not have much motivation to try to ""jump ahead of the line"" and get the vaccine early on, but if all of a sudden it is a requirement for international travel, then a lot of people who are not at risk will be willing to pay significant money to get it."
4558,"I have no idea how you get from this headline, or even the whole article, to vaccines."
4559,"That's on you, man."
4560,Don't blame anyone else.
4561,"&gt; Pediatricians are calling for an end to **teleportation** in children, because those children who have fever and vomit must be examined by a doctor in person."
4562,When the pope is ripping you for being a simpleton true believer... yikes.
4563,Are they right though?
4564,It’s heinous for GOP in the Senate to do this but is not passing anything truly better than passing nothing at all?
4565,"This is what it sounds like, when bees cough..."
4566,I recently saw for people 70 and up it was 5%.
4567,That's one out of 20.
4568,I know a lot of people that are from 70-95 years old.
4569,"Additionally, a lot of Americans are either overweight or diabetic regardless of age."
4570,That is a comorbidity.
4571,It’s unlikely unless the vaccine allows for out of pocket payments or the local government picks up the bill without checking whether they’re eligible.
4572,Most likely insurance will be involved if a person has private insurance or Medicare/Medicaid.
4573,There was a bunch of articles about it like a month ago or so.
4574,That a new strain had come from Spain and that it might be a lot worse.
4575,yeah let's all just spread covid woohoo problem solved
4576,"We know what works - testing, contact tracing, and quarantining people after exposure."
4577,But the US and some other western nations seemed to base their strategy on the hope that we would quickly develop some miracle treatment and make the other public health measures unnecessary.
4578,So we ended up with a stockpile of 60 million doses of hydroxychloroquine but not enough contact tracers.
4579,"This is literally not even from FHM, and they quickly changed this as far as I can remember."
4580,I don’t know where else to ask this so here goes: is there an article (or even a social media post) that lays out what covid-19 is and why it’s important to take precautions against it?
4581,I keep getting anti-mask/it’s all overblown type of arguments and linked articles from a couple of family members and I’m starting to question my sanity.
4582,This is why randomised clinical trials are so important.
4583,Not having them damages faith and trust in medical science.
4584,"Ironically it eventually drives some people into the arms of quacks peddling ""cures"" with dodgy data, but it works because they use the phrase ""big pharma is trying to suppress this""."
4585,"facts are the hardest-hit region of Sweden had a later holiday week when Denmark, is this a coincidence or a cause?"
4586,hard to say but shouldn't be dismissed.
4587,It’s very unlikely that unspecific treatment like vitamin D would show huge impact on corona infections.
4588,A few months ago a Spanish group published a study showing that vitamin D treatment would save most patients from intubation.
4589,"I don’t remember the figures exactly but approximately 1 out of 25 patients with vitD treatments needed intubation, while ~16 out of 25 without vitD treatment were intubated."
4590,To no one’s surprise this hasn’t been conformity by any other group...
4591,There are too many vitamin D trolls on the internet to find any reliable information at all.

4612,How sad is that.
4613,!remindme six weeks
4614,The vaccine is going directly to the people most at risk of death.
4615,Deaths should drop *dramatically*.
4616,Yup.
4617,Seems to be far more common with covid19 though.
4618,Lol Jesus Christ.
4619,How’s it feel all the way up on that high horse.
4620,Be careful not to fall.
4621,Wouldn’t want you to get hurt
4622,And it's only going to get worse.
4623,"Holiday shopping is wayyyyy more important than dying from a virus to many, many people."
4624,The stores will be flooded with careless humans and the death toll will continue to be rise.
4625,No one was told this.
4626,They have literally been saying the strategy is not about herd immunity.
4627,What are you talking about?
4628,I now officially hate when this is said.
4629,"Record hospitalizations doesn't some with an assumed ""covid related hospitalizations"""
4630,America isn't even going to *try* anymore?
4631,This a-dmin didn't just fail to contain it they are not stepping on to try to mitigate the damage.
4632,Maybe the new one will at least try.
4633,If not well be dealing with a tsunami in the new year.
4634,"I would also like to point that US shouldn't expect the same seasonality than Europe, since there are big behavioral and infrastructural differences."
4635,Temperature and UV is only part of the drop.
4636,"Summer vacations, escape to the country side, time spent outside in general etc."
4637,That's also why different states can have different timing.
4638,My fellow Americans...
4639,Welcome to earth.
4640,It wasn't.
4641,"And they didn't ""hype"" it."
4642,Tabloids chose to use one poorly translated sentence from each press conference where they repeatedly explained how herd immunity was **not** a strategy.
4643,They kept asking if herd immunity was a possibility.
4644,"As a scientist, Tegnell explained that it was not likely, but *might* be achieved if they got lucky."
4645,This somehow turned in to idiots running with that one sentence claiming it was Sweden's strategy.
4646,Just like you are doing now.
4647,If true that is a lot more people doing the right thing than I expected.
4648,You wrote he was hired “to help with modelling”.
4649,Yet you pretend “support the unit (for analysis) in their work with modelling and analysis” is the same and something entirely different than “help with the strategy”.
4650,The Unit for Analysis is the ”strategic unit” in the department Tegnell leads.
4651,Head of unit is Lisa Brouwer who we sometimes see at the press conferences.
4652,"The other units does stuff like monitoring and reporting, IT, legal affairs, product control, data and registers."
4653,The way you're thinking does not make any sense for the era.
4654,"These wars that were being fought were the most cruel and brutal humanity had ever seen, and they were fought because of perceived weakness."
4655,"Chamberlain's notions of diplomacy to secure peace did not work because the other side did not want peace, and it's entirely possible that WW2 could have gone a completely different way with far fewer lives lost if European Western powers opted not for diplomacy but for military action to keep Nazi Germany in check."
4656,The same could easily be said of the Soviet Union.
4657,World War 2 did not just end when the fighting stopped.
4658,"It continued in the Cold War, and the consequences of a weak America that didn't have the will to fight would have been catastrophic."
4659,but if u get covid you'll have to spend 2 weeks alone and sick and thats so much worse /s
4660,Exactly!
4661,A mask helps reduce risks for short necessary interactions.
4662,"It does not 100% prevent them, and the longer the interaction, the closer the interaction and the less ventilated the interaction the less the masks work."
4663,Lmao why regrettable?
4664,You are sounding abit sexist there gross
4665,You sound willfully ignorant as fuck with this line of logic.
4666,Reconsider your associations and consequent risks.
4667,Your brother is acting selfishly and like a jackass with unnecessary risk throwing a kegger wedding during a raging pandemic.
4668,Call a spade a spade
4669, Has GM been providing the same level of effort?
4670,Only time will tell.
4671,I can see some medical institutions making it mandatory.
4672,I work for a large healthcare system and see it coming.
4673,"COVID has already spread to all parts of the USA, travel will do nothing in an already uniformly infected country."
4674,Comparing Wuhan travel BEFORE the pandemic spread to travel AFTER it spread is apples and oranges.
4675,"Many studies have shown Vitamin D helps, and patients given megadoses of 60,000 IU showed huge benefit in survival terms, but everybody is different on how they absorb it, r/Covid19 has more info on these studies"
4676,The biggest covid denier I know is 75 with severe asthma.
4677,They do not care that the hospitals are full.
4678,They have health care workers in their family.
4679,"It's all ""libs, dems, etc""."
4680,No personal responsibility.
4681,"Hibernating for the winter couldn't hurt, either."
4682,Yeah seriously they really need to do that in The US cases are skyrocketing non-stop and the total Official (not excess) number of infected people atm is over 5 million meanwhile every state cases and deaths are surging.
4683,Not only NYC like before.
4684,"But you don't seem to take into account initial viral load that came into the the country, wouldnt it obviously make sense that the later the vacation the higher the spread is?"
4685,Or does timeframe mean nothing?
4686,The latter

4857,I don't trust cops.
4858,Especially when a lot of cops in town are related to a lot of the property owners.
4859,"While I think you're right with a number of points, I totally get the hesitation given cops penchant for shooting first and asking questions later and how people view property as having more rights than human beings."

4866,"If you are my friend and your not wearing a mask, I'm still your friend but your a damn idiot."
4867,It's really that simple.
4868,One of the great things when this thing is over is that I can go out and not be triggered by the 40% of people that my brain is screaming IDIOTS at.

5089,It's your funeral if by any miraculous chance that guy was an even bigger asshole than he seemed!
5090,You have an unknown pathogen confirmed in Nov. of 2019.
5091,That should have been reported to the WHO and the US should have been notified.
5092,That's what I was thinking.
5093,"With how aggressively it spreads, you really should be considering each household rather than individuals."
5094,"If any member of the household has COVID, chances are good (bad) that the rest of them do too."
5095,"Ha, I was the exact opposite, despite having been through the Swine Flu and Bird Flu, I heard that British PM say ""Herd Immunity"" as their plan and thought ""oh shit we're fucked, there's no way Trump does anything when there's a phrase that allows him to not""."
5096,Back in March I was telling friends and family that after the total deaths are tabulated (excess and whatnot) that we'd be over 1 million (but just barely).
5097,"""You mean infected?"""
5098,"""No dead."""
5099,"I'm thinking my napkin math may be a bit low, though."
5100,"It was basically 350mil people, 18mo before vax (without mitigation we all get it, but even with we probably still do) , 3% dead (however this is people who test positive and then die so it's probably high), @ 1% that would be 3.5 mil, so let's just say that local government can reduce that by a significant margin, ehh we're about 1 mil."
5101,Nice round number.

5108,You have your own government to thank for that.
5109,Wtf?
5110,That’s the most nonsensical metric for something like this.
5111,"I personally think it should be rolled out equally everywhere as much as possible given there will be inherent logistical and infrastructure differences between places, but through this approach someone in Texas or Florida who hasn’t taken this shit seriously (not saying everyone there hasn’t as a blanket statement) will be one of the first to have access to the vaccine over someone in like Massachusetts or Vermont which overall has done a much better job at taking this seriously simply because there is a significantly smaller amount of land for people to live on?"
5112,It’s not even biased in a way that makes sense for the administration since places like California will be high priority.
5113,Good to know.

5148,"Now, it's spread all over the country!"
5149,"Thanks, Obama!"
5150,True.
5151,There are some good teachers... and some good schools.
5152,I definitely over-generalized.
5153,I think covid-19 will expose the bad ones... because now all the parents can see and hear.
5154,Masks won't be forever lol
5155,Another American patriot who could care less about 300k people dying.
5156,You people are a multimillion strong 5th column for this virus.
5157,Jfc
5158,Well a lot of people consider “authoritarian” to be politely asked to wear a mask so...
5159,Seriously lol.
5160,"I’m not surprised they don’t miss regular life, they never got to partake in it"
5161,I would keep my mask around in case I'm sick and can't stay home even after this pandemic is over.
5162,What I (and I suspect many others) are against is the mandating of masks after the threat of Covid has greatly subsided whether through vaccination (ideally) or otherwise.
5163,People who for the rest of their lives choose to wear masks for any reason anywhere they go in public don't bother me at all.
5164,That's a matter of personal choice.
5165,"But blanket mask mandates for people regardless of whether sick or not after the threat of Covid has been diminished at any time (and believe me there  was someone pushing for that on another thread), just doesn't sit well with me."
5166,"So a bakery has to sell their product to anyone no matter what, even offensive/agressive customers, you have to serve them, you’re not allowed to refuse business to anyone?"
5167,That is so dumb.
5168,It is truthful.
5169,It actually happened.
5170,Censorship is shit.
5171,Fucking idiots and their “freedom”.
5172,Is it really that hard to do what the government tells you to and shut your mouth?
5173,They’ve never done us wrong and never will.

5176,for peddling snake oil to DYING PEOPLE?
5177,I read somewhere that ironically the second wave gave them the data they needed to speed up research results.
5178,Human right violations.
5179,"Right, do you mean the tens of.thousands dead in America?"
5180,Could it be that your point is just stupid?
5181,"I hear what you’re saying but you sound like a spoiled, entitled brat."
5182,Freedom also requires sacrifice.
5183,"And right now, that means looking past your selfish, meaningless, consumer-driven existence for one second and thinking of your community."
5184,Personal freedom.
5185,"To eat at the Cheesecake Factory, buy cheap Chinese imports, and go to a megachurch run by a charlatan."
5186,I hope you never need a hospital during this time.
5187,"And no, I don’t think a COVID diagnosis means a ticket to the ICU."
5188,"A broken bone, car accident, avocado injuries—you might be surprised when they turn you away, due to their capacity being reached."
5189,And then maybe you’ll rethink your definition of personal freedom.
5190,How about 300k+ plus excess deaths for a datapoint?
5191,"Let me guess, you don't believe that datapoint is real?"
5192,"So a bakery has to sell their product to anyone no matter what, even offensive/agressive customers, you have to serve them, you’re not allowed to refuse business to anyone?"
5193,I'm wearing one in public for the rest of my life.
5194,We could make regular flu seasons less deadly.
5195,"Plus, we are going to keep having pandemic level viruses as climate change gets fiercer."
5196,How can one survive without a job?
5197,This work thing sucks.
5198,I think the controversy is because there's little to no honesty from leaders.
5199,Everyone knows that schools should be the first thing to close if you really aim to stop transmission.
5200,School is free daycare.
5201,"Without it, millions of parents wouldn't be able to work (and we all remember the complaints about not being able to work from home with junior around from the first lockdown)."
5202,Schools being open is economic only - and they aren't wrong.
5203,It'd be a huge economic hit... they just aren't being honest.

5205,I think COVID will be glossed over and largely ignored in the history books 50 years from now.
5206,I doubt if Spanish Influenza gets more than a paragraph in a modern high school history textbook.
5207,"Our response to COVID has been a national embarrassment, and it's always easier to try to forget embarrassments than to dwell on them and learn from them."
5208,I think in any risk assessment there is going to be people in either end of the spectrum of beliefs but also people in the middle.
5209,You seem to be a person who is in one end of the spectrum.
5210,I think I am in the same end as yourself.
5211,"The people in the middle, the fence sitters-so to speak, might want a reason to feel comfortable about becoming more lax."
5212,"They might Bend to social pressure generally, but risk aversion is effortful, difficult and tiring."
5213,The more people who begin to relax now the worse the situation gets.
5214,"The more people who get covid the riskier things become, the spreading becomes easier and the exponential growth gets out of control."
5215,Because they're not orange...  Keep up!
5216,"Obvious, since 3 years of talking ""Russian traitor"" and the ""walls are closing in"" narrative just disappears overnight from the media"
5217,It doesn’t have to happen.
5218,"The US could be back to normal enjoying concerts now, going to NBA games, kids could all be back in school without masks, and everything could be as it was before."
5219,"But no, people there can’t even wear masks without putting up a fuss in the first place."
5220,There are definitely some good ones.

5225,"Notice it says ""death rate"" and not death count."

5228,I did this in May as well with them.
5229,I got my results in 2-3 days tho!
5230,I really don't like how the phrase herd immunity has been mostly spread around with COVID 19 news.

5238,This is the garbage argument.

5240,This is the bullshit claim I've been arguing against this whole time.
5241,"A publisher who says ""I won't publish your hateful Nazi drivel."""
5242,is not harming discourse.
5243,"&gt;I find CNN and MSNBC to be propagandists, but I don’t advocate deplatforming them."
5244,This is not a reasonable argument either!!!
5245,I'm not saying that propagandists shouldn't be able to use the internet.
5246,I'm saying that Youtube ought to disallow them from using their service.
5247,"I'm not saying that Nazis should be disallowed from writing, owning printing presses or binding books either."
5248,But I *am* saying that reasonable book publishers ought not to publish Nazis' books.
5249,"To  your example, I'm not saying CNN shouldn't be able to have a TV channel..."
5250,I'm saying CNN shouldn't allow Goebbels to have airtime on their channel.
5251,Your whole line of reasoning is a long string of mental hoops to jump through in order to justify propaganda.
5252,Ohio here.
5253,"In other news, the sky is blue and I paid taxes."

5260,It for sure has become crystal clear that America as a whole is a giant asshole.
5261,There are way too many selfish pricks roaming around.

5263,Hypocrites.
5264,Liars.
5265,Assholes.
5266,you only need to find one infected person who had not been reported to prove China was lying.
5267,Yet no one was able to do that.

5269,"They engage in reckless behavior, maybe this time they are lucky, but in general it's a habitual thing."

5347,"You would rather starve and go to food banks, live in your car or in a shelter and possibly be raped and your stuff gets stolen."
5348,Possibly get sick with covid19 anyway and be in hospital and be even more broke if there was such a thing.

5371,I don't think people are saying that because they think covid will kill off the entire population.
5372,"Every vaccine has gone through three stages of clinical trials, designed specifically to catch these side effects."
5373,"If there is such a side effect, it would be limited at best."
5374,I am wearing mask everytime I step out of my house.
5375,But this claim is very weak.
5376,"As someone said, contamination in public space is minimal compare to gathering indoor by ""friends and families""."
5377,I am wearing masks because I want to protect those who works in essential places.
5378,Be a nice person caring who put themselves in danger to support us.
5379,You are welcome.
5380,I hope the researchers will find effective treatments and cures soon.
5381,I also hope it stimulates research that will help others with similar after effects from other infections like those with lingering lyme or people with POTS after various viral infections.
5382,Sadly with Covid19 the researchers around the world will be spoiled for choice when it comes to possible research subjects :(

5391,"Yeah, those are the numbers I was referring to, just trying to use something easier than 1:1269."
5392,"They were around 5th or 6th in Europe, but have since gone way done as multiple countries peaked hard over fall."
5393,"However, compared to their neighbors, the most equivalent countries, Sweden is still doing far, far worse."
5394,"&gt; According to the California Restaurant Assn., restaurants can operate just as safely as other industries during the pandemic, 

That isn't true at all."
5395,Restaurants  have three actions that are known to significantly increase the chances of catching covid from an infected person.
5396,"One, you can't eat and drink while wearing a mask."
5397,So the mask will come down for a significant amount of time.
5398,"Two, You will likely be near others for long periods who also have their masks down."
5399,The longer you are exposed to someone with covid the more likely you are to contract it.
5400,"Third, restaurant atmosphere is normally a lot of conversation, sometimes loudly, sometimes laughing."
5401,"Loud talking, yelling, laughing, etc all tend to send viral  particles a little further out than just normal  conversation."
5402,None of these issues are present in a store setting.
5403,"Mask should be on at all times, the time you are around another person not in your household should be limited to a few minutes at most in checkout, and most people wont be talking loudly/yelling."
5404,Some people think 6 feet away is some sort of magic number like the virus hits 6 ft and 1/32 of an inch and immediately vaporizes or falls to the floor.
5405,The most concerning thing i have seen during this pandemic is some weird justification that profits come before people's lives.
5406,That income comes before health.
5407,While i feel for people that are struggling all i can say is you chose your income predicament by electing the same people over and over who do NOTHING to help you.
5408,"This shows we need to pick better leaders, ones that lead not playing partisan mind games."
5409,Lesser of the evils when it comes to Canadian politics
5410,Why can't we forcibly vaccinate the anti-vaxxers?
5411,"I understand your sentiment and generally agree, but there’s a difference between one individual lunatic doing something crazy and horrible because of what someone said to them and thousands of orchestrated people destroying property of people and businesses 100% unrelated to their issue, all in the name of a movement (even if it is a just one)."
5412,"&gt; Simply need to read the article not just the headline ;)

Friendly reminder that reddit is barely better than YouTube or fox or CNN comments"
5413,Very good article.
5414,On point with all my back of the napkin figures and timelines.
5415,I wish they went one level deeper from level 2 spread from the probably hundreds of thousands who get Covid and spread it over the next 5-14+ days to all they are in context with.
5416,"Then the real growth begins from Thanksgiving, on top of the growth we have now... just time time for Christmas."
5417,Oh wonderful.
5418,Its actually both.
5419,There are real concerns about the long term effects of this loss of education.
5420,If we only cared about free daycare we wouldn't care whether high schools were in person.
5421,that's not how this works
5422,"&gt; I feel awful for people who are taking precautions and still get COVID, or have to go to the hospital for an emergency during the pandemic."
5423,"I think about this a lot for me, personally."
5424,On the one hand...
5425,I don't want COVID and I take precautions.
5426,"The riskiest thing I do is go to the gym, but while there I 100% wear my mask, keep from touching my face, wash my hands and disinfect my phone as soon as I'm done."
5427,I test regularly and other than the gym it's home and the grocery store.
5428,That's it.
5429,On the other hand... if I were to get COVID I'd want to get it now.
5430,"My region still has &gt; 20% ICU bed availability, and although our positivity rate has crept up to 15% it's been slow."
5431,If I happened to get COVID now I should be able to get whatever medical attention I need.
5432,If things continue to get worse who knows what would happen if I got it mid Jan (for instance).
5433,On the plus side I'm in IL and our governor has taken a very scientific and data driven approach.
5434,Cases started to go up but he implemented more restrictions and things have been trending slowly downward.
5435,"I'm anxious though what mid Dec and mid Jan will look like, two weeks after the holidays."
5436,I’ll be real I don’t either.
5437,I’ll try to find 2018 flu data for you.
5438,And let’s be honest I’ve seen all types for all kinds of reasons compare this to 1918.
5439,It was the last time we all worse masks.
5440,"people are being killed for being asked to wear masks though, not just one."
5441,His point still stands.
5442,Wtf...
5443,Does a life not mean anything to these people?
5444,How mentally unstable do you have to be to do something this heinous?
5445,Ford and GM are basically health care companies that happen to make cars.

5475,Having to wear a mask post-vaccine distribution just to protect you denying diseased pieces of filth isnt going to fly.
5476,It behooves us to be cautions with any novel infectious agent.
5477,"Novel wasn't tacked onto it just for giggles, it means it's new and they don't know what it will do."
5478,I don't want to be a guinea pig finding out if my particular biology is more vulnerable to a long term problem much less death.
5479,I don't enjoy even have a common cold  so for that alone I would be happy to wear a mask even without the risk however small of serious after effects or of passing it on to someone else.

5507,I am more worried about residual effects from catching covid than the symptoms themselves in all honesty
5508,Yeah that would've been awful.
5509,"They really had no idea at all about viral infections back then (the article points that out), and treatment was so poor so influenza just absolutely ran rife."
5510,I still think it would be a long time (with the medical knowledge we have now) since 1 in 5 hospital beds were being used for one virus - although I have no idea where to look that up.
5511,I do find it amazing you're comparing today's situation to one from literally over a century ago - I assume to make the point that covid's not a big deal?
5512,Well it was supposed to be 'gone in April' 'with tha heeaaaat'.
5513,That sure didn't happen...
5514,"DICKS, I like it."

5523,Yeah.
5524,"South Korea has 50 million people, and only had less than 500 deaths."

5539,I used to sell them to Costco.

5545,It really is not that hard to do.
5546,"At this stage yes,  but if they lifted all restrictions too early and the cases built too quickly then potentially no."
5547,It could easily escalate into a six week one if they didn’t get on it fast enough.
5548,"Either way, we’re in a really good place and considering the shit-show in the USA I’m happy for a few minor restrictions to keep everyone safe."

5708,My doctors think I have this in addition to narcolepsy or Hypersomnia.
5709,It's actually one reason I was afraid of catching Covid because my heart already works too hard.
5710,What I technically have currently is inappropriate sinus tachycardia but I also have other dysautonomic symptoms.
5711,I'm a generally healthy 25 year old male and my heart rate would be over 100 just waking up day to day.
5712,I used to get light headed and faint after showers and finally after buying a smart watch with heart monitor I found out my pulse would hit as high as 170-180 just after taking a shower.
5713,I spent years thinking I was just weak because mild exercise could end with me balled up in a corner trying not to vomit or pass out.
5714,"There is medicine that's helped me a ton, but I really don't have it all that bad and my symptoms have been pretty manageable."
5715,For some people it is a long road back to anything resembling normalcy.
5716,I don't know what it takes to make people care anymore honestly.
5717,My life and career was pretty much totally upended by a chronic sleep disorder that's been disabling and which I could have gotten from something as simple as flu or strep throat.
5718,I've shared this info with lots of my friends so they would know what it's like for something so simple to change your life.
5719,I got lots of sympathetic responses and then saw that many (not all) of those same people continued to go on about their life with little to no precaution.
5720,I guess they truly are in denial that anything of the sort can happen to them.
5721,Because being an anti-masker is just dumb.
5722,"The potential benefits for the country, and the individual, of wearing a mask are huge, with close to zero downside"
5723,COVID has taught me how truly selfish and genuinely awful people are
5724,One thing I'm learning is that conservatism does not imply caution.
5725,It means an intense desire for things to stay to stay the same.
5726,"&gt;These people grew up in China, and not once do I remember any of them complaining about government overreach."
5727,Well we do and I can go ranting for hours.
5728,But guess what?
5729,"90% the China news in NYT CNN WSJ are just crap(such as most reports about Xinjiang and HK ), they are either heavily twisted perspective or outright lies."
5730,"But the real issues that 99% Chinese care about were never mentioned, such as censorship on films and Games, the stupid Great Firewall, Capitalists have their way overriding labor laws,  the very unfair education system which favored the rich and those who live in mega cities, etc."
5731,"If you are a Chinese living in Mainland who read western media everyday, it is crystal clear that they only report very limited and twisted Chinese stories to fit a certain narrative , While showing ZERO interest to engage  what Chinese people really cares , or What pain Chinese people are suffering."
5732,"As such, the audience in the west were never presented with a ""real"" picture of how life in China is."
5733,"Deaths, hospitalizations and ICU admission all peaked in mid April - at least two months before the summer vacation."
5734,"Summer surely helped and sped up the decline, but it had been declining for some time by then."
5735,"I would say that the main reason for the decline was that people were better at adhering to the recommendations back in the spring, while during fall they have gone back to normal."
5736,"I’m sick of people pointing out that this virus usually kills old people, like that makes it less of a problem"
5737,I had a good time there.
5738,Randomly walked into a street party/fair that was really happening.
5739,Checked out the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
5740,You seem like a real dickhead.
5741,We all want to do our part to flatten the curve but you are straight up acting like you’re above people that have been waiting tables their whole lives.
5742,Not everyone is built the same.
5743,Have some compassion for those struggling to feed their families.
5744,Ppl like you who only see one side of the coin are just as bad as the anti-maskers.
5745,How are you going to get Bob McDumbass to take a vaccine if they won’t even wear a mask?
5746,"&gt;“If it is not an N95 mask, well, then you won’t be sure that it does protect you properly,” said Lisa Drylie, a nurse working in an operating-room division of the Sanford Hospital in Fargo, N.D.

&gt;‘A mask mandate has to be part of the mitigation of spread.’
— Adam Hohman, a 43-year-old nurse practitioner in Fargo, N.D.

&gt;“So, no, I don’t think that a mandatory masks mandate is going to help us,”

Guarantee this idiot was a C student in high school"
5747,He actually said it could be a q3 event at that time too so pretty remarkable
5748,"Wait, wait, wait."
5749,What city do you live in where the homeless people are so violently aggressive and well-armed that grocery stores need armed guards?
5750,"Besides the fact that homeless people are more likely to be victims of violence rather than perpetrators, if there's a problem with homeless people robbing grocery stores, then maybe the solution is just to give them food."
5751,Doctors make good money tho
5752,&gt;The Case Fatality Rate (resolved cases only) is now at 0.048%.

5756,Plus their stock ticker is MRNA.
5757,Chin diaper is the phrase I like to use.
5758,They really don't like that.
5759,I just wish they eased up a little on the membership card.
5760,"I get they want only the members to use it, but it always left a bad taste in my mouth when a long while back my mom went to run to get something she forgot and my god, I've never seen a business so ardently not want money, hE hAs tO bE On tHe AdDeD MeMbErLiSt, or you can see we share the last name, shut the fuck up."
5761,"God forbid you try to go with a roommate, here's some advice for those who want a way to go around it in a way no one can stop you, shop together with your friend/roommate, keep a tab, then Venmo them the money and stand in line for a chicken bake while they pay."
5762,this has to be the meanest blightking comment ever!
5763,What's going on with this thread?
5764,Look at all the downvoted comments.
5765,The biggest question i have about coronavirus is.
5766,When they start mass vaccinating how are they going to prevent people from giving people coronavirus while going to get the vaccine.
5767,Some are going to have coronavirus and not know.
5768,So they end up with the virus before the vaccine can be effective and spread it more before the shot becomes effective.
5769,I noticed when i smoke a big cloud comes out my mask for instance then the next in line walks right in to it as i step forward and they step where i was.
5770,"The film really sped up the development of a vaccine, too."
5771,"As for competency, if the current administration listened to the experts, especially Fauci, and put teeth into a plan it would've been much better."
5772,"just all the comments ""don't send a vaccine to states who don't believe in it"" ""rural states are getting what they deserve"" ect."
5773,wears a little thin after a while 🥴
5774,This phenomenon isn’t unique to COVID-19.
5775,Post viral illness is a known phenomenon.
5776,No message intended just offering the fact.
5777,Beat it lady.
5778,So tired of these people.
5779,It's not hard to wear a mask.
5780,Mask up and be kind.
5781,Peace.
5782,A slap on the wrist but just a light slap.
5783,I read earlier today a synagogue in NYC held a wedding for the grand rabbi's son or grandson and it was a packed 7000 capacity venue.
5784,They actively tried to have a sneak wedding without being caught.
5785,No social distancing when places of worship are only allowed 50% capacity and no masks on anyone.
5786,Got slapped with $15000 fine which is about $5 for every person they were over.
5787,That wont even pay the cover for crappy club.
5788,It should have been a $250 fine for every person over.
5789,That would have been over $750k and that money should have went to the doctors and nurses that are going to be forced to take care of the resulting outbreak.
5790,Mongolia is a country hostile to China...
5791,Wait what lol context?
5792,How can they get better than 99.6%?
5793,Facebook tells me it's 99.6%.
5794,"Even though the official numbers say under 98% and the official estimate of asymptomatic would make that slightly under 99%, facebook tells me 99.6%, so that's what I'll believe."
5795,"Also, long haulers are fake news and the government will never let us out of lockdown."
5796,I see dead people
5797,"They would have to be accommodated, just like the people who legitimately cannot wear a mask."
5798,They are very small in number.
5799,"The Astra Zeneca vaccine has been shown to be effective in the elderly, and many vaccines are recommended for the over-65s, like flu."
5800,"Flu vaccine is also among those vaccines recommended for immunocompromised patients, and it is likely the covid-19 vaccines will join them."
5801,What are the 'health reasons' you have in mind?
5802,The rate will go up sharply too when medical facilities are overwhelmed.
5803,And that's indeed not an 'if' but a 'when'.
5804,It isnt a out that - it is that since corruption is so rampant in Russia you really cant trust that ANYTHING is truly what it seems.
5805,It is by design.
5806,So i am glad Russians will have a free vaccine.
5807,"I am less happy that the vaccine wasn’t necessarily tested for safety  in a standard, peer reviewed way."
5808,fREdom
5809,Not an issue if the shots work.
5810,No need to frown yet.
5811,happy spotify triangle day
5812,I've become a huge instacart fan.
5813,"Yeah, my weekly groceries might end up costing me $150 rather than $135 if I went to the store myself."
5814,It's so worth it though.
5815,Obviously I'm lucky to be able to afford it.
5816,"Many, many women are under the delusion that violence is now 'empowering'."
5817,Almost none of them have ever experienced it.
5818,"Civilization is on the verge of collapse, and I'm deadly serious."
5819,Yea armed guards are normally paid much higher.
5820,"If you are unarmed sitting in a parking lot and your job is to call the police, you are probably getting $7.25."
5821,This is your average mall or walmart security guard overnight.
5822,Nobody freaks out over seatbelt laws...
5823,What do you think a restaurant makes more money off of?
5824,"4 people having appetizers, drinks and dessert along with a 20% gratuity to the waitstaff or one guy ordering an entree thru postmates which takes a percentage of the money from the order?"
5825,Not saying I’m against this but come on man don’t act like restaurants can make anywhere near the same profits by only doing takeout and delivery.
5826,Free testing going away NOW is game over.
5827,We are in a world of shit.
5828,"No way will Mitch the asshole approve anything, let alone an extension for free testing funds."
5829,Jesus.
5830,I agree.
5831,Haven’t found COVID jokes funny for months.
5832,I’m trying to describe the feeling ...
5833,I think it’s just existential indifference.
5834,"I’m investing in solo backpacking gear for all seasons and planning to spend more time in the wild, where no one expects anything of me, and I expect nothing of anyone else."
5835,The amount of raw need everywhere I look is overwhelming.
5836,"At first, I was excited to be a physician and eager to volunteer in the “war effort”, but then people just started inviting the enemy inside, aiding and promoting it even."
5837,"Now I just feel like I’m trying to help a lot of people who didn’t care enough to help themselves, and it’s rubbing off."
5838,I should have been a park ranger.

5870,Don’t!
5871,Be afraid to go to the hospital if you need to.
5872,Take care of yourself.
5873,"Nope not true at all, not a single respiratory disease will prevent you from wearing a mask...I take care of people all the time with end of life copd and they wear their masks."
5874,So that argument is complete bullshit.
5875,ohio is dangerous yall
5876,Except the woman who stood up in the store was shot outside the store in the above story.
5877,These 'anti-maskers' are crazy.
5878,"Everyone thinks they don‘t have the virus, that’s why 50%+ of transmissions are asymptomatic."
5879,Welcome to the wonderful world of state inspections.
5880,"Oh, god."
5881,As if 4 years of the Malignant Narcissist wasn't bad enough.
5882,We do not need that shifty idiot in the Oval Office.
5883,I cannot even imagine.
5884,This is why I honestly get so angry at customers who freak out on me and my employees for not enforcing the mask rule .
5885,Corporate refuses to hire anyone to enforce it.
5886,"I've gotten screamed at for it , but its not worth it."
5887,My employees' lives are worth more than this.
5888,My life is worth more than this.
5889,We've already had to call the police on a customer who threatened one of our checkers with going to get his gun out of his car because she asked him about not having a mask.
5890,That's one of like three we've banned recently for this reason .
5891,Its so easy to feel righteous and blame people when its not you or somebody you know on the line.
5892,"This is what happens when an entire population embraces masks, social distancing, and staying at home."
5893,I would welcome those things being made permanent even after COVID is no longer a threat.
5894,where in australia does it cost that much?
5895,in my experience you can  just go to a drive through clinic that is 100% free (i am in vic though so that might influence my experience)
5896,7 cases were imported from overseas today.
5897,"As of Yesterday, 37 cases remain in the hospital and 1 is placed in the intensive care unit."

5903,Covid-19 PCR tests will be made available to the general public at 600 locations starting from 01 Dec.
5904,I've worked as a nurse in LTC and dealt with the state inspectors.
5905,There are a lot of blanket regulations that are enforced with no thought as to their actual impact in individual scenarios.
5906,We can't even have bottled drinks at the nurses station.
5907,Heaven help you if an inspector catches you taking a sip of water.
5908,Nope.
5909,Long term stay at home mandates dont work
5910,At this point almost everyone living in my city is wearing a mask.
5911,"If I go shopping and see someone without a mask, it’s like a flashing light with a sign “DANGER, CRAZY VIOLENT PERSON”."
5912,At this point anyone not wearing a mask is clearly insane and talking to them is probably just going to result in violence.
5913,"Hell, I bet some of them don’t wear on a mask on purpose hoping to get confronted so that they can start a fight."
5914,I don’t want to give them that satisfaction.
5915,I just glare at them from a safe distance away and hope a police officer has been called by the store employees.

5924,"Groceries, prescriptions, living in an apartment with shared ventilation?"
5925,"Even people who stay at home have some interaction with the outside world, because people have to eat you know."
5926,Or they work essential jobs and can’t just stay at home because they need money to eat and pay rent.
5927,"If everyone took this seriously they’d be fine, but no, dumb selfish fucks can’t put on a mask or not party without sobbing about their “fReEDom!!11!"
5928,!”
5929,Hopefully Bandai Nancy follow as my wife has loved working from home during lockdown and doesn’t want to return to the office full time now we have setup a nice home office for her.
5930,"She doesn’t mind going in now and then but she is so much more productive without the constant desk side interruptions, two hour long lunch breaks and being pulled into meetings she doesn’t need to be in."
5931,She also finds it easier to manage her team and that her team is more productive working from home so she has been pushing against their return to office mindset as much as possible.
5932,"OANN, because Fox didn't pander enough to your liking"
5933,They just passed New Jersey numbers that they hit in mid April.
5934,Worth noting is that new jersey had already been under pretty tight lockdown orders for nearly a month when their death rate peaked and began to fall.
5935,There is no indication that South Dakota is anywhere near their peak.
5936,The new infections have only come down a little in the last few days and that might not be sustained.
5937,Even if new infections have peaked the deaths that are coming are already baked in.
5938,The bucket did not go that far bud.
5939,And the fact that we were lied to as timing made it worse.
5940,"As to the can/bucket, where I am from we say bucket to emphasize the scale of something, you kick the can down the road when its a little thing, bucket (or some say barrel) when its a big thing."
5941,You’ve done the math.
5942,It just doesn’t work.
5943,"With temps on the downward trend, many places cannot really even do field hospitals."
5944,There will be a mass amount of demand for medical treatment and a very clear lack of supply of medical professionals to give it.
5945,"Not shutting down our country hard this winter will be seen as our worst mistake of the pandemic in future history books, I fear."
5946,"For a government, maybe."
5947,But I think In dire enough situations it’s reasonable.
5948,"I mean for goodness sake we literally
Had a a draft before."
5949,That is forcing people to die in a war.
5950,Getting a vaccine is 100x less dangerous or unethical.
5951,Private companies should be able to mandate.
5952,Gyms and restaurants have been closed for over a month now.
5953,"Even better, when the headline doesn't mention what country it is, all the antis assume it's America, but it's actually Canada or Europe or whatever and there's no convincing them that shitty things happen there too."

5956,"Ok, thanks."
5957,"Yes, if the EUA is granted, it will be available for distribution."
5958,"They will authorize emergency use of the vaccine, but the vaccine will have undergone a different standard for this authorization (a lower bar for efficacy and safety) than any other vaccine that is available commercially."
5959,"&gt;Expect those levels by Xmas

Where we're going to fly around the country and mix households again!"
5960,Goodie!
5961,"If everyone had quarantined for a month then went directly to the party it would, in fact, have been impossible for them to get sick."
5962,What are you even talking about?
5963,"&gt; Coronavirus cases are emerging in their highest numbers of the pandemic,  with more than 175,000 a day, on average, in a country that has seen  more cases and more deaths than anywhere else in the world."
5964,"Yep because many choose to ignore guidelines ""cause it ain't that bad""."
5965,"Meanwhile health professionals are screaming that hospitals are overflowing, they are understaffed and they are exhausted 

Only 1% of those that test positive  become serious or critical they say at our current rate that is 1750 people a day become serious or critical."
5966,That is more than 50k in a month.
5967,We only have 100k total ICU beds and people need those beds for other  illnesses too.
5968,"Other countries are handling this pandemic much better because they got leadership, we have a bunch of partisan drama queens playing politics."
5969,Even underdeveloped countries are doing better than us.
5970,The best way we can honor the Tradition of Thanksgiving is not by making big parties but cooking sharing your food and praying for each other .
5971,Not by making large gathering and  burdening our hospital and hospital staff while we suffer caring for people getting sick bc they spreading disease.
5972,People are going to soon see how deadly the “This only will impact those coastal cities” attitude is.
5973,https://web.archive.org/web/20201125175745/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/25/health/doctors-nurses-covid-stress.html
5974,Here's the trick.
5975,People are going to make the wrong decision and they are *going to be vindicated by it.
5976,* They will get lucky and avoid the virus entirely.
5977,Or they will be asymptomatic.
5978,Or they will get a mild case.
5979,"They won't ever feel the impact and they will tell themselves ""see, I knew it would be fine, everything turned out okay."""
5980,"Because people don't understand statistics, they don't understand virus propagation, they don't understand R0."
5981,"They look at the spiking graph and think ""that sucks, but it wasn't *my* fault."
5982,I'm not sick.
5983,"Or I just had the sniffles for a couple days and didn't go outside until the day after."""
5984,"Millions of people will never know, personally, that they propagated the virus to two other people."
5985,Probably two people they don't even know.
5986,But that propagation is where the spike comes from.
5987,The main intent of all this social distancing isn't to keep yourself safe as an individual.
5988,It's to *slow down the propagation*.
5989,"And that, unfortunately, is something no individual will ever be aware whether or not they succeeded at."
5990,So it's not going to be anybody's fault.
5991,"And we can all go about our lives, oblivious."
5992,Happy Thanksgiving!
5993,"I hope there are some excellent studies in a few years that factor in the fact that people aren't driving as much, going out less etc along with complicating factors such as people not going to the Drs office for regular checkups etc to get the true Covid numbers"
5994,the article is irrelevant.
5995,"The claim that you can;t get sick if you follow precautions is irresponsible, ignorant, and just plain stupid."
5996,Mmmm ranch.
5997,False.
5998,"I know the hospital system you're talking about in Ohio and its 3.4 billion in revenue, not profit."
5999,You know one thing that doesn't spread covid?
6000,Video chat.
6001,The capability is amazingly widely available.
6002,"Wait for the virus that can mutate between biological and digital, THEN we will be truly screwed."
6003,"But until then, this remains an option."
6004,Just like people would rather get trampled on Black Friday instead of comfortably shopping at home still boggles my mind.
6005,"I am not being dishonest, and I am disappointed that you would come after me instead of the information that I presented."
6006,I went off of what I read.
6007,"If you want to dispute what I presented, then please provide evidence."
6008,But do not go after my honesty.
6009,"As a PhD, you should be ashamed with yourself."
6010,"I wasn’t calling you out specifically, more so that the way people react to events/situations can say a lot about their character."
6011,Sorry you are having such a hard year.
6012,How would they have gotten covid if they stayed at home?
6013,[removed]
6014,&gt;has nothing to do with the kind of “great reset” the conspiracy types are going on about.
6015,"Well the conspiracy guys imagined it as a ""Communist New World Order"" right?"
6016,"And here comes the ""World Economic Forum"" with it's plan to 

&gt;As we enter a unique window of opportunity to shape the recovery, this initiative will offer insights to help inform all those determining the future state of global relations, the direction of national economies, the priorities of societies, the nature of business models and the management of a global commons."
6017,"Drawing from the vision and vast expertise of the leaders engaged across the Forum’s communities, the Great Reset initiative has a set of dimensions to build a new social contract that honours the dignity of every human being."
6018,I mean .. it's just funny.
6019,"It certainly *sounds* a bit like a ""New World Order""."
6020,&gt;I don't understand why people can't just not see each other in person.
6021,A lot of people need real human contact to cope with stress.
6022,I don't feel that need personally but I know people who do and it's hard to watch them suffer.
6023,"If we want everyone to stay home we should be paying them a monthly stipend, subsidizing everyone's internet, working with mental health professionals to do wellness checks for people living alone, offering clear, consistent leadership - basically doing everything we can to ease the psychological burden of the pandemic."
6024,Instead everyone is getting dogpiled by bullshit day after day after day.
6025,Obviously the conspiracy theorists are beyond help but I'm not surprised that rational people are snapping and visiting family too.
6026,This was completely predictable.
6027,"When 300 people died of covid in the US, some said survival rate was 99.9999%."
6028,"When 300,000 people died, it was 99.9%."
6029,"A lot of people don't know what ""survival rate"" means."
6030,Rules for thee and not for me.
6031,Shocking I tell you
6032,"Yes, it ""kicked the bucket down the road"" to the point where a vaccine is imminent and we could actually prevent a lot of these deaths from occuring."
6033,The finish line is in sight and people are just choosing to trip and fall on their face rather than sustain their effort just a little bit longer.
6034,It's baffling.
6035,"(Also, the saying is ""kick the can down the road,"" although the bucket may actually be a more apt metaphor in your case)"

6038,*
6039,I'm in the northeast so its pretty cold here currently.
6040,Masks we can do but I know that they won't actually adhere for long.
6041,"Granted, my state has been one of the better ones."
6042,"With only 4 of us and none of us flying in or anything, its PROBABLY ok."
6043,But I really wish we'd skip altogether.
6044,"Like i said my wife is at the point that she'd go without me, so I don't have much say."
6045,I guess.
6046,"Even so, I don’t see much cause for concern in regards to the original sentiment discussed; that a significant number of people will ease up in a significant manner merely because they know a small cohort of others are being vaccinated."
6047,Seems to be more fear mongering than anything.
6048,Who knows?
6049,Maybe I’m giving people too much credit.
6050,"Maybe I’m projecting, because I know that I will personally still practice sensibility (e.g."
6051,"mask wearing, distancing, small gatherings, etc.)"
6052,"even after I am vaccinated, until public health officials say it’s not irresponsible to do otherwise."
6053,I don't follow.
6054,The vaccine is for getting immunity *without* getting the virus.
6055,"If everyone actually gets the vaccine like they should, a 95%+ effective vaccine, combined with very little community spread (due to mostly immunized population) will result in a very, very low chance of you getting COVID post-vaccine."
6056,I think you're just confusing natural herd immunity numbers (70%+ have to actually get infected) with vaccine immunity.
6057,There's a reason we've been working so hard towards a vaccine.
6058,&gt; It’s not possible to “take every precaution” when you’re having a family gathering.
6059,Actually it is.
6060,They could have quarantined for a month each.
6061,but that's not what was wrong with the post.
6062,"The original claim made was that someone there had to have been breaking the rules to get sick in the first place to give it to everyone else, which while possible, even likely, it's not the inherently true."
6063,You can get sick and do everything right.
6064,Go play with some crayons and let the adults talk.
6065,Because you can't deny medical help to someone just because you disagree with them?
6066,If you are positive then you are still shedding the virus and technically still active regardless of how long it has been.
6067,This right here.
6068,What's in the best interest of a company?
6069,Closing down because of sick workers?
6070,Being understaffed and moving employees around and pissing off customers?
6071,Having employees show that it's not a safe place to shop?
6072,Just saying.
6073,HR has done a great job where I'm at of weeding people out and giving them finals.
6074,10 days is basically a couple (two) of weeks
6075,"Could be anything, who knows haha"
6076,"2,224 is how many people died in our hospital alone from covid bw &amp; that was just bw march - April."
6077,I am still mentally &amp; physically exhausted.
6078,Heart breaking experience.
6079,It also took financial toll....  my finances still a mess from all money spent on personnel protective gear and days missed from work on and off bc of injury from moving patient.
6080,I don't have words to express what this year been like.
6081,Terrible the lives lost.
6082,Also horrible seeing how combating this disease was turned into a political debate instead of people working hard together to prevent the spread of disease that was the biggest travesty of all.
6083,Praying we do better at prevention
6084,"Here in Minnesota we pretend she doesn't exist, and hope her husband comes out of the closet one of these days."
6085,What aren’t people taking this free pass to avoid hanging out with their family this thanksgiving?
6086,Does anyone really like their family?
6087,[removed]
6088,One other question - I'm curious about your note about sources.
6089,We have primary sources at about every stage of copy throughout.
6090,Do you feel they aren't thorough enough?
6091,Just because your state had a mask mandate doesn't mean people listened.
6092,That's why we're here ffs.
6093,"Yeah so I’m in Florida, love in the more liberal Tampa Bay Area and I’d say a slight majority wear masks."
6094,Like if I’d have to say I’d say 60% wear them and 40% don’t or have it on wrong.
6095,But we had to go pass by rural Florida last month and stop at a gas station and 11/11 people in there including the employees had no mask on.
6096,Whole different breed in rural florida
6097,And it's only going to take sacrificing a couple thousands of lives to do so
6098,My suggestion to them after classes end for winter break would be pretend you have it for 10-14 days and eat outside/in your room and wear a mask in shared living spaces (opening windows and a hepa filter are good if you spend more than a few minutes out of the room).
6099,If testing is more accessible you can test on day 8 (they start to work then) and wait for results
6100,I like humans who are not the greatest disease vector in modern times
6101,When we reopen to visitors I hope you come!

6105,:)
6106,Darwin awards.
6107,Just a shame they'll take innocent people with them.
6108,I serve in local government and I can answer your questions about the state not stepping in.
6109,"In general, local and state governments have to pass balanced budgets (so if we want to spend it or appropriate it, we have to show we have the revenues to support it)."
6110,The federal government is allowed to deficit spend funds it doesn't yet have.
6111,"So even though my city council really wants to help more, our hands are tied."
6112,"We applied for CARES Act funds, received some, and distributed it all in the community, but beyond that we aren't able to do much."
6113,"We are also preempted, in my state, from raising taxes by more than 1% per year over the existing rate."
6114,"And by that, I don't mean we can go from 3 to 4%, for example."
6115,I mean we are maxed at going from 3 to 3.03%.
6116,"At the city level, we provide most of the services people need day to day, like utilities and libraries, but each year we have found our costs going up and our state assistance dwindling."
6117,"It is a precarious position, for sure, and we would like to do more but simply can't."
6118,&gt; they say no just quit if you do not like it?
6119,"That is the option for them to use, for sure."
6120,It always comes down to how much of a pain in the ass it would be to replace me vs the cost of just giving me what I want.
6121,Unpopular opinion: Thanksgiving leftovers don't taste good off a ventilator either.
6122,sowa panas
6123,Recall her
6124,"unfortunately, yup."
6125,"https://www.svd.se/mejlen-avslojar-tegnells-val-huvudlos-strategi

Check it yourself."
6126,"As far as comparing the treatment group vs the test group, even though that was the initial intent; when one group (in this case the treatment group) gets altered your test vs control analysis is no longer balanced."
6127,Although test vs control is the preferred method of analysis for drug trials several statistical methods exist for analyzing data where more than one difference exists.
6128,This is referred to as multivariate analysis.
6129,"It's not even that complicated, you usually learn multivariate analysis in the first semester of college ""intro statistics""."
6130,This becomes slightly more complicated because you are dealing with a yes/no outcome.
6131,Usually you watt until second semester to learn how to do multivariate analysis on yes/no outcomes.
6132,Still nowhere close to rocket science.
6133,Damn it Staten Island.
6134,Get your shit together.
6135,"ICU numbers are still low in Manhattan hospitals, per my COVID nurse friend."
6136,"You do realize that most of those people would still be alive if not for covid, right?"
6137,Why is leadership in such short supply in today's world ?
6138,Fuck those people right?
6139,They had their time.

6141,"No, only the Pfizer one needs ultra cold -70 degrees."
6142,The moderna one is 95% effective and only needs -20 degrees for long term storage.
6143,The moderna vaccine can also be stored at regular refrigerator temperature for up to a week.
6144,&gt; The development of death rates in January to August indicates a decline in life expectancy for both women and men this year.
6145,From 84.7 to 84.4 years for women and from 81.3 to 80.8 years for men.
6146,"snip snip

&gt;""But the increased spread of covid-19 we are seeing now may well lead to more extra deaths in the last two months of the year, which could lead to even lower life expectancy in 2020,"" says Örjan Hemström."

&gt;Between 1 January and 31 August this year, there were almost 6 500 more deaths than in the same period in 2019."
6148,"That's 4,800 more deaths than expected based on the latest population projection for 2020."

6154,Agreed.
6155,Bachmann still around and god is talking to her .
6156,Something about not wearing a mask
6157,Thank you!
6158,"Re: anti-vaxxer, we use that term because - at least to us - it means a very specific thing."
6159,"People are against vaccines, period."
6160,"But we also get that if you're asking that question/wanting to clarify it, it means others may be as well."
6161,"I'll talk to my team and we will definitely go back through it and see if we can be more fine-tuned with that, I appreciate your pointing it out."
6162,"And you're right, we probably should emphasize the side effects more."
6163,I think we probably leaned too much towards not scaring people about it but if it's deemed too far off the mark that just creates trust issues.
6164,"Thank you for your thoughtful stuff here, for real."
6165,I'm screenshotting and sending along!
6166,Just got an email from an old friend from back home who is decidedly anti-mask.
6167,He calls anyone who wears one weak.
6168,"Then again he's always been one who thinks being tough means never taking precautions, such as driving in dangerous conditions or drinking and driving."
6169,"He's one of those friends you know for a long time, but as the years go on you realize how different you are."
6170,Yes it is.
6171,"I don't work in healthcare but am an ""essential worker"" who has been working on location this entire time and I have to say that I very much relate to this."
6172,"I also had covid an am still dealing with issues related to that yet people at work won't wear one mask and here I am with two on, scared."
6173,"&gt;sleep during all of my off-time to cope

6180,"Both ""sides"" sound so much alike and you don't even realize it."
6181,"You're giving the option that you could be wrong, which isn't black and white, sure."
6182,I'm talking about your opinion itself though.
6183,You're saying you don't think people are changing.
6184,"Lack of change, or lack of adaptation, is its own absolute, but also, what are they not changing from?"
6185,"They're not changing from being cautious or not, all the way since the first lockdown."
6186,"The context chains all the way to that either or statement, and that either or covers the whole timeline ""ever since the first lockdown."""
6187,"You're still classifying people as cautious or not, no matter how many degrees there are in those categories."
6188,People are not adapting and cautious or not adapting and not cautious.
6189,"Hence, black and white."
6190,In this context (i.e.
6191,"online) that kind of classification is easy to skew as no one here would agree what ""cautious"" is, and we all have our own implicit assumptions about it and are likely getting different conclusions of your opinion."
6192,Way too logistically complicated.
6193,"That would require weekly or more testing of like 30,000 trial participants."
6194,With labor laws as toothless as they are that's a good way to get fired.
6195,All for an election that is such a long drawn-out process it's very hard to win (thank you Taft-Hartley).
6196,This guy is a shit stain.
6197,"Right, but if I went and got tested today and got a positive, nobody would know where on my ""Covid timeline"" I am, right?"
6198,Beginning?
6199,3 days in?
6200,7 Days in?
6201,I could be anywhere on that timeline.
6202,"So there are maybe 14 days of ""relevant"" timeline at the beginning of the infection, but then there are (up to) &gt;74&lt; days afterwards where I still test positive."
6203,"Doesnt that mean that there is a much greater chance of me being ""positive but finished"" than ""positive and active""?"
6204,CALIFORNIA IS #1 BABY
6205,"Initially I think the it was purely motivated by politics and profits, but at this point I'm cynical enough to consider the possibility that they've made a deliberate decision to allow, or even encourage, deaths and infections."
6206,When I look at the response of states like Florida it's hard to imagine what else they could be trying to accomplish.
6207,At the very least the clear message is that they're perfectly fine with it.
6208,I'm in your same situation.
6209,My husband is insisting on traveling to his parents' house (about a 4 hour drive away) and coming back the same day.
6210,8+ hours in the car just to sit at a picnic table outside his parents house wearing masks.
6211,I said I'm not comfortable going and now he's giving me the silent treatment lol.
6212,It's unfortunate too because up until now we've been pretty much eye to eye on these type of precautions.
6213,"Thanks appreciate it,

But you seem confused like I am."
6214,The person above me said it was referring to covid Hospitalizations not record Hospitalizations in general.
6215,"Some of us had hobbies like ""movies"" and ""theme parks"" and ""church"" and ""going to the bookstore on a quiet Sunday morning to drink coffee and read magazines"" that we can't engage in right now because of the epic mismanagement of our government."
6216,I'm so glad I caught the Rona a week ago compared to the upcoming wave.
6217,I did everything in my power since January to stay safe but it inevitably got me when I came into work to take a test.
6218,My symptoms are clearing up now so I think I'll be okay but I couldn't imagine needing a hospital in a month and they just tell me go home and good luck.
6219,This.
6220,"I hate that there are people who automatically clump together those who take vaccines and think critically about these vaccines, the FDA and the data with anti-vaxxers who hate all vaccines."
6221,"""I have a good reason to travel for Thanksgiving."
6222,"The rest of you don't, but I do."""
6223,Many more would’ve died if we invaded.
6224,Clearly you don’t understand how this works.
6225,You know mental health is also a concern.
6226,"In a time where people were glued to Reddit, a level of pragmatism about the whole thing can go a long way in easing a lot of consciousness."
6227,It’s better to take things at face value then to give an uneducated analysis (as I’ve seen quite commonly)
6228,"25-30% of Americans will be gambling with lives over this weekend, theirs or their loved ones."
6229,"People they don't know, it's all a big crap shoot to them and the odds are irrelevant."
6230,[removed]
6231,It isn't.
6232,You can't even get into college without a bunch of vaccines.
6233,This isn't some new idea.
6234,Mandatory vaccines have been a thing for decades.
6235,For sure!
6236,It is a personal choice.
6237,I see a few people not in my household regularly and will be seeing the same people for Thanksgiving.
6238,"My so has lots of health issues, but it is a choice we made together."
6239,I also babysit 2 kids so could get covid from them.
6240,Not if they aren't already prevalent to some extent.
6241,"If 99% covid patients have the vaccine succumbing strain, and just the 1% have the mink strain, it will take that strain much longer to spread because I don't think a person can have two Covid strains at once, he will most likely be infected by strain 1 before the mink strain gets to him."
6242,So... Another delay for cyberpunk right?
6243,I mean... You should not release the game when the country is in a shape like this.
6244,"My coworker literally said, ""I take 0 precautions and live life normally.."
6245,"If I was going to catch it, I would have by now."""
6246,Instead of being overdramatic you should realize that you also think that way.
6247,No one is advocating for a full lock down (everyone stays at home besides service man who distribute food).
6248,There are always trade-offs and there is a line somewhere when it becomes too costly to protect against Covid specifically.
6249,To even have a debate everyone needs to realize it's about that line and not about humanity or lack of of people who think the line is somewhere else than you do.
6250,"My kids went to school last year with a local cosmetic surgeon (we pulled them, they’re now home)."
6251,"The Dr sent out a huge email about how kids should be in school, “do your own research”, kids don’t get this blah blah blah."
6252,We paid the penalty and signed the kids up for online school.
6253,That school had their first positive and everyone was sent home.
6254,Meanwhile mine have thrived in online school.
6255,Thank goodness.
6256,But wait!
6257,The son is grieved by his father’s Covid death but is still saying the decision to have Thanksgiving is “a tough choice?!!
6258,!” I don’t get why only 10% fewer Americans are traveling for Turkey day this year when the pandemic is raging away?
6259,Wowza.
6260,You debunked nothing.
6261,That Japanese leadership was divided and deadlocked is precisely the point that you are missing.
6262,"Think of it this way: *even after* the first atomic bomb was dropped, it still took Japan NINE DAYS to surrender."
6263,"""Private entreaties"" by minority leaders or not, this fact shows how reluctant those actually in charge were to give up the fight."
6264,Yeah it turns out the flu is also... not a joke.
6265,Optimal for teleportation.
6266,"That’s not always the case, so yes it is good news"
6267,"I am literally commenting on the fact restaurants, stores, and what not are still open."
6268,The government won't shut up about private gatherings but there is barely a peep about anywhere where money exchanges hands.
6269,I'm sick of it.
6270,We need an aid package desperately but the gov has it's head in the sand.
6271,Maybe I misinterpreted OPs comment but every competent western government closed as much as possible and paid their people to stay home and they are practically COVID free.
6272,Same.
6273,As long as I’m not getting fired for trying to work from home with my kid she’s staying with us until a vaccine.
6274,You really don't understand how vaccines work.
6275,They only truly protect you if enough people around you also took it.
6276,Poland is a theocracy just as intense as any in the Middle East.
6277,"I understand the sentiment, but I still think we should try to save as many lives as possible, regardless of politics."
6278,tell me why the anti maskers get an ICU bed but the people who did everything right that got infected by these assholes gets no medical care.
6279,in what world does that make any sense?
6280,More people need to understand the Swiss cheese theory.
6281,"Yes, masks and social distancing mitigate the spread somewhat."
6282,But ultimately the two measures are like Swiss cheese stacked on top of one another.
6283,Each slice of cheese has massive holes that can only be somewhat blocked by another layer of cheese.
6284,Mmmmm....I’m going to fix myself a grilled cheese sandwich now.
6285,I’ve been trying to warn about this particular damage for months.
6286,Studies have been showing since at least summer that asymptomatic individuals are not out of the clear entirely..
6287,[removed]
6288,[deleted]
6289,"&gt; In mid-June, three migrant workers staying at the Starved Rock Motor Inn in Streator, Ill., about 100 miles west of Chicago, tested positive for the novel coronavirus."
6290,Upwards of 50 other workers were staying at the motel and had tested negative.
6291,"I'm all about investigative reporting and writing a good story, but let's be real here, Illinois was already a COVID hotspot throughout April and May."
6292,Perhaps these three sparked a surge of cases in a town somewhere.
6293,Perhaps it was a delivery driver or a commuter or a student or any of a million vectors.
6294,I just can't see how migrant workers had as much influence on rural America as the Sturgis rally two months later when half a million people decided to roll the dice and then head home to share it with everyone.
6295,I'm convinced it will go down in history as the single most damaging event throughout this entire pandemic.
6296,"The people of the United States stand in solidarity with the Polish people; we will wish and pretender *harder* that the pandemic is over, maybe then it’ll go away!"
6297,"Jokes aside, a very unfortunate year for us all in the western hemisphere."
6298,So... the data says 5% of the population isn't flying.
6299,OP concludes that a 10% drop in total travel is impossible.
6300,I am simply saying that an alternate explanation for a drop in flight travel is a possibility.
6301,More data showing a 5% drop in flight travel isn't super useful to prove that it's an overall trend over different kinds of travel.
6302,The analysis is faulty.
6303,"You got me off my ass to actually google it, so here's something from TripAdvisor showing only a 14% drop YOY."
6304,"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tripadvisor-reveals-2020-thanksgiving-travel-index-over-half-56-of-americans-still-traveling-301168088.html

Hardly ""bunk"", hardly impossible."
6305,No I'm not.
6306,You're out to lunch and turning it into something it is not.
6307,When you were born into society you were never required to wear a mask to go out in public and get whay you need to survive lol.
6308,So stop.
6309,Edit: again every please wear a mask.
6310,I feel like overcoming some social awkwardness later in life would be far easier than overcoming heart disease.
6311,So I think you made the right choice.
6312,"Ha, I read this in CNN the other day."
6313,Glad you all have a cute new catch phrase to add to the lexicon.
6314,"Sounds like my half-Polish heritage husband would love it there, now i know where it comes from."
6315,The public will have more confidence if peer reviewed studies for pfizer and moderna show the same kind of efficacy teased by their preliminary data.
6316,"We don't study or test for it very much, but asymptomatic flu infections aren't super uncommon."
6317,"([https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/flu/](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/flu/))

Although out of curiosity, where is she that is doing routine asymptomatic testing for both flu and covid, everywhere I'm familiar with might do testing of asymptomatic people for covid, but not for flu."
6318,Why didn't we shut down all non-essential travel?
6319,"College students returning home could be considered essential, but no one should be getting on a plane right now without a super good reason."
6320,First thanksgiving in a while other teams than the Falcons are playing.
6321,"Last two thanksgivings it was interesting waiting all day on thanksgiving to watch them, pretty unique feeling honestly because the whole country is watching"
6322,Not dissing the lives of people on SSDI (my girlfriend is) but I fucking hate work so bad I think about killing myself.
6323,Work is boring.
6324,The one plus about my job is besides the pay being pretty good ($80k in a fairly LCOL area) is I get a lot of vacation time.
6325,I am bored during times where I have to go to work.
6326,"I keep thinking ""this sucks ass"" while trying to concentrate on teaching college students."
6327,I actually do it well enough to get better than average reviews but it sucks majorly.
6328,"I just want to be retired, because during vacations I'm happy as a pig in shit even though most of the time I stay in the house."
6329,"As far as goals and productivity, that's for things in my personal life, not work."
6330,MMR vaccination has been mandatory in Poland since 2003.
6331,"That's pretty late, so there may be a lot of adults who have not yet had it."
6332,"It should also be noted that there is a strong anti-vaccination movement in Poland, so even with 'mandatory' vaccines they have only \~95% uptake."
6333,How so?
6334,The fact there’s country handling this worse than the US is fucking sad.
6335,I thought were we alone in our sheer stupidity.
6336,Fucking sad.
6337,The f are you responding to me for?
6338,"That's literally what I said, reread my post dude

&gt; You might be not like it but COVID is real and has way worse of an outcome of ""within a decimal point"""
6339,I don't see any non-believers directly called out in this story.
6340,Just sad all around.
6341,"&gt; Massey said his father always wore a mask when he ventured out, and trusted others around him to be as careful as he was."
6342,He said his anger comes from thinking that trust was a critical mistake.
6343,"&gt; “People just need to know how important it is not to drop your guard, to be cautious, to wear masks around everybody,” Massey said."
6344,What is so complex about the global pandemic killing people and that no one has any idea of the disease's effects after one year?
6345,"No, not at all complex, just gross mismanagement."
6346,It should have been snuffed out with the same urgency as shown in Wuhan.
6347,"I'm literally talking about the last couple of weeks, not making predictions."
6348,New hospitalizations are clearly on the decline.
6349,Yet sadly there are selfish assholes going out there times a week who haven't got it yet.
6350,"Bad luck, but a reminder to stay vigilant."
6351,"Sounds like we will need to wait on their Phase 3 trial data, which comes out next month, to get a full picture of the data."
6352,Some parents dont have a choice.
6353,Single parents for example gotta pay Bill's:(
6354,So you mean lock all the anti-maskers in a specific area for them?
6355,I'm all for that.
6356,We can make a colony of anti-maskers and shut down all roads leading to it.
6357,So you'd be more than happy to eat at a restaurant that makes up its own health rules?
6358,"Maybe the owner doesn't believe in refrigeration, and all the meat is just stored in a closet."
6359,"And since this owner can do whatever they want, maybe they want to cut the meat up on the floor in the bathroom with an ice scraper and serve it to you."
6360,Do you understand why this is a horrible idea?
6361,"These people care for only one thing, money, and will do whatever they can to maximize their profits."
6362,Including willfully endangering people.
6363,Leaving the decision in the hands of the business owners is what made Wisconsin one of the worst outbreak locations in the world.
6364,"They are not responsible enough to do it on their own and have to be ordered to do it (and a lot of them are suing the state to get every single health order rescinded, further endangering EVERYONE)"
6365,US?
6366,"I remember in school learning about concentration camps in Germany, and how bad it was to be."
6367,"It's one thing to read about it, but  then the teacher showed us that famous black and white documentary with the piles of bodies, and the sick lying around."
6368,It was a moment I wouldn't forget.
6369,There needs to be a documentary similar on the devastation of COVID.
6370,"Not so much interviews, but like those videos in Italy of people vomiting blood and pink foam up."
6371,Literally sloughing the linings of their lungs out as they nearly choke to death.
6372,"I have family in Poland, as well, and heard nothing from them about this."
6373,"When I talked to a cousin a few weeks ago, he was adamant that CoVid wasn’t in Poland."
6374,Same warning as do not put penis in a grinder.
6375,Those not doing it would not need the warning to remind them not to.
6376,Those doing it would not let the warning stop them.
6377,there’s some trend right now but I doubt it sticks... restrictions were intensified last week by closing gyms and restaurants and malls (finally)
6378,It'll be lifted a couple to a few months after vaccines are available to every American.
6379,"If the option to protect yourself is there, the justification for a mask order wouldn't be."
6380,not even talking about the ones who survive with issues AND hospital bills
6381,"Hers is pretty mild, all things considered."
6382,"For one person, no."
6383,For the community as a whole?
6384,Debateable.
6385,"That's a shockingly low number, which would be really positive if true."
6386,I was assuming 70-80% were going to ignore them.
6387,I really think the worst of my compatriots rn.
6388,"I think he’s talking more about the crowd that says shit like avoid expecting a vaccine until this time next year, which from personal experience there are a lot of"
6389,"no, you changed the title of thr piece"
6390,That's why it would be vital to make sure that healthcare systems don't get overwhelmed.
6391,But moronic people won't wear masks and practice social distancing.
6392,Governments don't impose restrictions fast enough.
6393,"People got tired of ""flattening the curve"", but it is one of the most important thing they can do to mitigate the situation."
6394,Masks are mandatory where I work (Covid-19 test station) but I wouldn't wear them outside normally unless it gets really crowded.
6395,"You really don't need to wear them outside, even superspreader events in inside locations have only something like 50% infection rate."
6396,I canceled my dental appointments for the year
6397,&gt; The overwhelming sentiment is that we should power through and accept the dead toll.
6398,I think it's the correct strategy.
6399,This is an article about children having multiple organ damage and the ICU's running out of room.
6400,The idea that powering through the deaths and massive damage to children is thought of as acceptable is egregious.
6401,What has become of our humanity.
6402,I agree with your points too but masks and social distancing can mitigate the spread.
6403,"Irresponsible, reckless, or stupid behavior can negate all those efforts."
6404,The activities you mentioned can be performed relatively safely.
6405,Go outside for fresh air and sunshine but don't meet up with groups and if you see many people around go somewhere else.
6406,Use curbside delivery.
6407,Wipe the bag handles and sanitize your hands before preparing the food.
6408,Go to the doctor but wear a mask and have a full mini bottle of hand sanitizer to avoid using the public options.
6409,We can't eradicate this disease but we can can be vigilant is mitigating it's spread.
6410,"Then you have people like my family, who my wife and I are choosing not to see, who will be visiting multiple households on Thanksgiving."
6411,Oh and both my parents are over 60 and I have a brother with asthma.
6412,I agree with your points too but masks and social distancing can mitigate the spread.
6413,"Irresponsible, reckless, or stupid behavior can negate all those efforts."
6414,The activities you mentioned can be performed relatively safely.
6415,Go outside for fresh air and sunshine but don't meet up with groups and if you see many people around go somewhere else.
6416,Use curbside delivery.
6417,Wipe the bag handles and sanitize your hands before preparing the food.
6418,Go to the doctor but wear a mask and have a full mini bottle of hand sanitizer to avoid using the public options.
6419,We can't eradicate this disease but we can can be vigilant is mitigating it's spread.
6420,Totally.
6421,"A lot of my concern about COVID is *because* of my experience with the flu - Guillain Barre Syndrome and full paralysis (and 99% recovery; this was a long time ago, took about a year to walk on my own)"
6422,That’s insane!
6423,I’m in San Francisco- SF Unified public school district.
6424,We are 100% remote and we’re not even ALLOWED to go in the building without strict permission.
6425,"Like, teacher safety has been #1 goal."
6426,I haven’t been asked to interact with ANYONE in person since March 13.
6427,Some parts of this country are absolutely insane.
6428,Thank you.
6429,Yeah and just a big fuck you to all the medical and hospital staff working grueling hours and watching people needlessly die.
6430,Evangelicals in the US's bible belt listen to Trump not the Pope.
6431,Most hypocritical general population on earth they are.
6432,You are performing some mental gymnastics worthy of the Olympics.
6433,You are comparing water to wearing mask.
6434,"You go outside and you agree, as part of being a member of society, to walk on side walks (you can get fined for jaywalking)."
6435,You don’t push people out of your way (assault).
6436,You typically don’t cut in line (potential loss of service and scorn).
6437,You don’t take food or drinks you want from others (theft).
6438,"All society rules that you agree to when you walk outside (also, clothes!)."
6439,“Wear a mask to protect society from an airborne virus” is in the same realm.
6440,You can drop the sealioning.
6441,You’re looking for a bad faith argument.
6442,That is waaayyyyy too low.
6443,Don't forget that usually it can take several years to identify the virus.
6444,Here the definition of this virus has been identified very quickly.
6445,It explains also why all is going so fast.
6446,So where then?
6447,"It is *not* pedantic to point out that a power-law and an exponential function (of x) are not the same thing, though."
6448,They are *completely different* functions that arise in completely different ways.
6449,The underlying dynamics of a system exhibiting power-law growth generally has next to nothing in common with the underlying dynamics of a system exhibiting exponential growth.
6450,"Now, a quick google scholar search reveals that the spread of the coronavirus has followed a power-law in some countries, at some points in the pandemic."
6451,"This is interesting because, again, the underlying dynamics are completely different."
6452,You won't get a power law if everyone is spreading the disease to a fixed number of other people.
6453,"As you pointed out, your example was correct and I know you do understand this."
6454,"Most people do not, though."
6455,"The second a curve starts to bend up, people say ""exponential growth,"" but frequently when I have replotted the data on a semi-log plot, it becomes clear that it is not actually exponential growth at all."
6456,Maybe themselves
6457,Google Moncef Slaoui and read the CNN article.
6458,“Just a flu...”
6459,What's a private company?
6460,The CDC is a governmental organisation.
6461,In any case this argument goes nowhere necessarily because a legal framework does not mean something is inherently good or the correct thing to be doing.
6462,"Yes there are some countries where are they required to have some vaccinations, such as for yellow fever which can have it death rate of up to 50%."
6463,Not quite the same thing though is it?
6464,"And it's an established vaccine using an established method, for an established/understood dangerous disease."
6465,its all good its only for one holiday season.
6466,Its for the betterment of many more doing this.
6467,I'd rather miss one and have the opportunity to enjoy many more experiences with family than have one where a bunch might get sick and not be around to enljoy more.
6468,Yeah but the \~economy\~ needs to stay afloat.
6469,It's worth losing a few kids and grandparents here and there.
6470,/s
6471,I shortened the content - polish titles are usually story titles like books giving zero information but an intro like “Something bad is brewing!” with no context whatsoever
6472,"About 15,000 people have been in the Oxford trails in Brazil, South Africa nd the UK since July."
6473,Thats 4 months there
6474,&gt;Higher points of contact and spreading the virus.
6475,What do you mean?
6476,"Let's say my mother is in the hospital with Covid, surrounded by other people who have Covid, and the doctors are all working in that environment ..

.. so who is at risk if I go to my mother?"
6477,ME?
6478,So I would go home and quarantine for 2 weeks.
6479,"It seems kind of unbelievable that in order to protect me from an illness that most likely will not affect me, *two* people have to suffer one of the worst, saddest things I can imagine."
6480,I once knew a guy with asymptomatic type 2 diabetes and gangrene.
6481,He never saw it coming when they amputated his foot.
6482,All caps?
6483,Grandma is that you??
6484,?
6485,"I don’t know about most of them, but Alyssa Milano has posted about hers a bit."
6486,"Depending on vaccinations, case numbers, and quarantine requirements, the situation could change and air travel could be safe and viable again as soon as the spring."
6487,"I'm not booking anything until the summer, though."
6488,Second point isn't a flag.
6489,The efficacy is based on how many are infected in the placebo arm compared with the vaccine arm so it doesn't matter how many infections are in the country as long as enough happen in the trial.
6490,Stop waving.
6491,It's unscientific.
6492,The state.
6493,North Dakota is exciting in all sorts of bad ways
6494,So is that a herd immunity strategy?
6495,Or a mitigation strategy?
6496,Kap not getting a call up this year proves his time off has been purely political
6497,We did in March.
6498,"It’s been a hell of a struggle to manage the kid and working from home with nonstop jobs, but I’d rather not chance it."
6499,I just worry about his development.
6500,Totally!
6501,My dad let an abandoned cat into his house a couple months before he died.
6502,Guess who has the cat now?
6503,"She is the nicest cat I’ve ever encountered, just a blessing."
6504,"There was no way I was going to let her be “dumped,” for a 2nd time."
6505,She deserved better.
6506,Unless you really wanted to get that dog pregnant
6507,"A week or so before Christmas, I'm afraid there might be some unfortunate discoveries, awaiting for those who choose *not* to stay home for the holidays."
6508,"btw, keep those medical professionals, who are working hard to help folks, in mind, *especially,* during the holiday season."
6509,lmao
6510,Mask use in Orange County is pretty high.
6511,"Typically the only places I go out to are Publix, Walmart, Target, Lowes and a reef aquarium store for supplies for my tank."
6512,I’d say mask use is about 90% at those places.
6513,I very rarely see anyone without a mask on inside.
6514,"However one county over in Lake, mask use is significantly lower."
6515,If only we had a state wide mandate.......
6516,Will do stay inside and don’t go out 👌
6517,"~~Breadlines are growing, businesses closing, death-count rising and~~ stocks ... soaring!"
6518,[It's official: Women are better leaders in a pandemic](https://www.pri.org/stories/2020-08-31/its-official-women-are-better-leaders-pandemic).
6519,Right?
6520,"I guess when they said ""it will disappear after elections"" - I guess they meant the leadership not the virus...."
6521,"Pain apparently does respond to painkillers, but bad headache, overall muscle aches and pain, chills, inflammation, fever and/or fatigue can last approximately one to four days."
6522,This doesn't happen to everyone.
6523,Some trial participants only have mild outcomes.
6524,"That said, it's common because the immune system typically responds and that response makes a person feel sick."
6525,Its wild.
6526,I see it on local news pages.
6527,"People responding to these articles, saying things like ""Great job Governor!"
6528,"We want to stay open!"""
6529,"I want so desperately to explain why that's wrong, and how masks would help, but I dunno, I don't have it in me anymore."
6530,Can't imagine that there are a lot of people that are like him 😭
6531,Cleary it's easier to brandish brass knuckles.
6532,&gt;False.
6533,What do you mean?
6534,waiting on my husbands company to do this as well.
6535,I mean several of the employees already do.
6536,The company has paid for upgrades to everyone's internet.
6537,Bought new computers for the entire team.
6538,There has been no one screwing off.
6539,Makes sense
6540,Their wiki page says it a bit different.
6541,"They were already talking with enix, but the movie did so bad enix was ready to back out until sony gave square a ton of money and bought like 1/5 of their stocks."
6542,then enix was willing to finalize the deal.
6543,I've always wondering if that 20% sony control didn't have something to do with changes in the company as well.
6544,Not really...
6545,[deleted]
6546,"Not dumb, shortsighted maybe."
6547,"I think more people at work that I come in contact with keep theirs on, or put it back on because i always keep mine on (not because if the rules or that I would tell on them, I'm more likely to stew over the few that are blatant and wish ill will upon them, the rest mainly try to be cautious just not as cautious as myself or some others and I don't judge them for a society wide failure that shows institutional shortcomings more than individual inadequacies)."
6548,"I think my wearing it may cause them to think, hmm, yes, I suppose I should be wearing mine too, he is being cautious maybe I should be as well."
6549,But that means that the lax behavior can spread easily as well.
6550,"'Oh, it's just Pete not wearing his mask right now, he's not an idiot, he's not out partying, I'm probably okay to relax and take mine off too.'"
6551,"Nothing really wrong with that, per se, and I don't judge those people."
6552,"I do think they may underestimate just how royally this country f'ed up but tens of millions have done so (then tens of millions more are even worse and think we f'ed up by doing anything at all and masks are a totalitarian plot and nanny state overreach, etc."
6553,etc.
6554,veering off toward more and more bizarre conspiracy theories).
6555,It's a minor human mistake and I feel bad for the son and in his shoes would feel an intense rage toward this entire country.
6556,From what that morons do daily they would definitely go for this anti-LGBT zones... Who gives a fuck about people dying when two gay people want equal right!
6557,Not on their watch!
6558,Right?
6559,Korean war vet.
6560,"When I die, I want the people who I did group projects with to lower me into my grave so they can let me down one last time"
6561,I sold a home this spring site unseen from 5 states away to an individual as a primary residence
6562,"No surprise Ohio has over 10,000 cases today - unconscionable"
6563,I moved to Florida and moved back to the North East in 6 months.
6564,We literally fled.
6565,What a godforsaken armpit of a state.
6566,unemployment is your right dude lol wtf
6567,Even Americans up into their late seventies have on average one more decade to live.
6568,"So yeah, the 55 and even 65 year old death stats, even look at in a clinically utilitarian way, show multiple decades of life wiped out."
6569,It's an awful attempt at downplaying the pandemic
6570,"We’re number one if you flip the graph, we’re the best out if every country."
6571,Keep living in fear
6572,There are communities where you'd starve to death if banned from Walmart.

6575,I wish I could afford both normal and spicy mustard but you have a rich family 😭
6576,[deleted]
6577,My point was more that almost everyone else has experienced a benefit while healthcare workers are getting the shaft.
6578,"Home workers no longer have to commute, get dressed, and don’t have to arrange extra childcare for kids no longer in school."
6579,it seems unlikely most will do the right thing.
6580,Those who actually care will do what's right because they can think beyond themselves and instant gratification.
6581,It sucks to have to spend it alone or not with the normal group of family/friends you usually do but its the right thing to do for the community and everyone you care about.
6582,All it takes is one to infect the group and then all those infected go out and infect others they care about because everyone is seeing multiple groups of friends in small numbers.
6583,You can't have 10 groups of 5 friends you see maskless.
6584,"Vaccine trials are double blinded, meaning neither the people doing the study or the participants know who has a placebo."
6585,"People get the shot and then go on with their normal lives, and then there are benchmarks at a certain number of positive infections to evaluate the data."
6586,Yeah I'd definitely rather have the pfizer or the moderna one once it becomes available instead of the Oxford one
6587,"Probably be like 2500 today, which would be a new record, but 15 European countries reported a higher number than that today on a per capita basis, some more than twice as high as the US, just getting worse everywhere it seems"
6588,And this is why people do not take any of the warnings seriously.
6589,Thank you politicians.
6590,I got one.
6591,I kept it in case it is needed to move to the front of the line for a vaccine.
6592,I want to get vaccinated ASAP for my own safety.
6593,The authors of this piece suggest that the Danish study is being misinterpreted.

6595,"The whole ""immunity thing don't last"" thing is quite silly and alarmist."
6596,"Fading antibody levels is not the same as fading immunity 1) antibodies often disappear a while after infection is over, it's what it's supposed to do, otherwise our whole body weight would be nothing but antibodies."
6597,"In mild infections, they disappear quickly, in serious infections, they hang around for longer."

6916,Our hospital was understaffed before COVID.
6917,It's going to be a bloodbath.
6918,😣
6919,Way to go handling the situation like an adult.
6920,Hello guys I have tested positive for Covid today but I have started to have symptoms like 4 days ago.
6921,And right now I'm feeling pressure on my chest it's not painful in anyway it's like little pressure (someone would be lightly stading on my chest) what should I do?
6922,Should I call anyone or I mean - maybe it has something to do with my psychic state that I know I have Covid so I tend to think that this pressure is a thing?
6923,Thank you!
6924,My school has the options of virtual learning or in-person learning.
6925,"My grades were suffering during the first quarter (all virtual), so they sent me back for second quarter."
6926,I got a cold within two weeks of going back for the first time.
6927,"I had to stay home from school, since this year, it’s against policy to come in-person if we’re experiencing any symptoms of sickness, even if we’re absolutely sure it’s just a cold."
6928,I got tested for COVID-19.
6929,"My stepdad, a high school chemistry teacher, said it was a waste of my time."
6930,"Thankfully, I tested negative, but he made me wake up at 5 to debate him on whether or not I should return to school."
6931,"At this point, we were both aware of the no-tolerance-for-sickness policy, but he wanted me to go anyway."
6932,He only backed down almost an hour later when my mom said that I had to go by what the school advises.
6933,This entire thing happened less than two weeks after someone just four months older than me (I am 13 yrs.
6934,"3 mths, he was 13 yrs."
6935,7 mths) died of COVID-19.
6936,The fact that they opened up schools before the vaccine came out sickens me (figuratively).
6937,"As prophesied, spread continues unchecked."
6938,I'm awaiting Friday's spectacle with disturbed interest.
6939,"Not trying to stir up anything, but besides ad-hominem attacks do you have anything to counter his claims?"

6942,1.
6943,"As someone who has been working from home since March, I have cut back on my spending for lunches, coffees etc."
6944,only a little.
6945,"My increased spending on ""stuff"" and even outings when I do venture outside has actually increased to offset this."
6946,I suspect this will be a similar case for most people.
6947,2.
6948,This question should always be on every employee's mind if they are concerned about job security.
6949,"The most successful companies are under tremendous pressure to increase revenue / reduce expenses any way they can, so I'm sure this has been a conversation for several companies already."
6950,"If anything, in my opinion, this may just accelerate that timetable slightly."

6954,They didn't say in the articles I read.
6955,They only talked about how some were surprised because they didn't have the symptoms.
6956,The articles can be found on CNN and CNBC.
6957,They were more focused on explaining how doctors need to be upfront with patients so that people don't become frightened and refuse to come back for the second injection.
6958,"I was financially independent from the day I left college, which was, well, OK, 22."
6959,"They mean if you get your vaccine on day 1, you're not supposed to just go back to normal until enough other people get it."
6960,"If you're in the states, they're talking about like 5% of the population getting vaccinated in 2020 and then like 10-15% a month after that."
6961,"When it's about 50%, that's when things can chill."
6962,"So do the math, it's like March/April."
6963,&gt;Herd immunity works natural or vaccine initiated.
6964,In which cases have natural herd immunity worked though?
6965,They listened to Trump claim it would disappear.
6966,"Also that was in the beginning during ""lockdowns"" when people shouldn't have been walking around at all."
6967,"Actually considering the state of telecommuting that really isn't a thing anymore, as long as you have a solid internet connection it can be just done for the most part remotely."
6968,Seriously half the shit that happens is in an office anyway is fucking not needed time wasting.
6969,"That is the future of work, it's been pretty clear for awhile."
6970,"I've been getting doorbuster ads for a few weeks now, but they are all available for online ordering, so like I ordered some fabric today, that was part of a black friday sale, from my phone"
6971,The one I work at had decided in summer to end in person instruction today.
6972,"They wound up asking faculty to pivot the few in person classes online last week instead due to rising cases, but basically they do not want people who went home coming back."
6973,"&amp;#x200B;

My alma mater went further and said if you leave for Thanksgiving you are not under any circumstances allowed on campus until spring semester starts, though that's a small school with 100% of students living on campus so they have a much tighter bubble situation than most."
6974,Josh is not smart

- In ICU: 2,356 (+25)
- New deaths: 200"
6979,"So, in other words you don't acknowledge it."
6980,The excess deaths are due to alcohol and other causes suddenly and inexplicably becoming worse not because of a global pandemic.
6981,300k+ excess American deaths since the start of the pandemic.
6982,The tree of liberty needs to be watered with the blood of those over the age of 65 or with preexisting conditions.

7037,Of course not.
7038,There are legitimate safety issues and a solid track record of severe albeit rare adverse effects from all sort of tested vaccines.
7039,And this vaccine is totally new and untested.

7090,"You might as well just say nothing at all, since that'll do about as much good and won't have any negative side effects."
7091,a lot of colleges have scheduled their semesters to end at Thanksgiving break and not return to campus at all until the Spring.
7092,SARS was contained.
7093,It also had an exponentially IFR than SAR-CoV-2.

7102,"I don't know, I don't like the idea of the government forcing people to do things against their will, but this isn't matterer of personal liberties this is a public health issue."
7103,I'm okay with airlines saying no vaccine - no flight.
7104,"I'm okay with schools telling parents - no vaccination, no schooling (and making it mandatory that kids go to school)."
7105,"I think I'd be okay with this too, but there are some more in-depth ethical questions here."
7106,Taxpayers will be left with the bill when they aren't able to insure.
7107,"Generally, I'm okay with using sticks if they don't want to take the carrot of a vaccine, curbing deaths, and being responsible members of society."
7108,I just think that it's a very tricky issue and the needs of society supercede the wants of the individual here.
7109,If the mom accepts that Covid contributed to her daughter's death; then she has to accept that her actions and decisions about whether to social distance and wear masks impacted her daughter's outcome.

7182,I absolutely understand some people are in that situation.

7184,You know what else you could do in that situation?
7185,"You could see that person face to face safely, without gathering a large group of people and sitting around a table indoors with no masks on because you're eating."
7186,And they could do that ANY time.
7187,They could've done it in August.
7188,They could do it next month.

7211,Majority of the people wearing face masks.
7212,Kids attending schools and and parents going to work.
7213,There is no compensation if you have to isolate so if they know that there is no chance to have a test but risk of losing income/job they  unfortunately decided to keep working even with mild symptoms.
7214,Huge protests in most of the cities may also affect spreading of the virus.

7219,Probably depend on which country you're in.
7220,"For the developed world like say the US, Canada, Europe etc they'll probably be able to get enough doses to vaccianate the majority of their population by next year."
7221,Pfizer have said they can produce like 1.3 billion doses and moderna said they could produce 1 billion doses then oxford i think can produce a similar amount.
7222,i was reading the other day Canada has secured like over 400 million doses of various vaccines.
7223,And i think the UK secured like 350 million doses of various vaccines as well.
7224,And i bet both would have enough from the 3 vaccines that are likely to be approved to vaccinate the majority of their population.

7239,"Not only have many companies already experimented in this way, but many have also realized the pitfalls and brought many portions back home as result, in that time period."
7240,"The vaccine won't be 100% effective, so the people who refuse to get vaccinated will be putting those who did in danger."
7241,&gt; There would likely be no turning back when it starts getting abused.
7242,There are plenty of rights that continually have to be promoted and reinforced.
7243,"The problem in this case is that the right not to get vaccinated is not based in reality, and does put a burden on others."
7244,I'm saying they're both the same mRNA tech bud
7245,"To some folks, there's just something fun about being out in the crowds around that time of year."
7246,"Personally, it gets me into the Christmas spirit a bit, since a lot of people are there to get gifts, there are a ton of decorations up, etc."
7247,"Also personally, I have a job that doesn't allow me to be very festive/get excited about the holidays (long hours, a ton of stress, lots of deadlines, etc."
7248,"right up until X-mas), so I'll take that feeling where I can get it."
7249,"Also, it used to be fun to be out all night shopping with friends (before overnight sales were reduced in lieu of Friday morning-afternoon sales)."
7250,Just my perspective on Black Friday.
7251,"All that said, I obviously won't be doing any non-online shopping this year."
7252,I'm just marking it up as another experience lost to the coronavirus.
7253,"It's not worth complaining about too much, as I know others have it much, much worse than I do."

7255,It's also a lot of college students going home from school.
7256,"Which is also a problem, but they don't really have a choice."
7257,"Yikes, I didn't know that it's that bad in Poland."
7258,And there seems to be no significant trend downwards in the daily new cases.
7259,Deep State is paying doctors to list Covid on death certificates not cancer or a heart attack.
7260,Not sure how they explain it happing all over the world.
7261,"As these cases skyrocket and move out of nursing homes into the community, I am starting to have peers get it and they’re *really sick* not like oh, I’ve got the flu sick, but like oh, shit, I need to go to the hospital because my lips are turning blue sick."
7262,People in their 20’s and 30’s.
7263,A friend that just turned 40 is on a ventilator in a different state due to overcrowding.
7264,"that might be the straw that broke the camel's back but I am pretty sure how the war was going was the reason, and the war was going poorly because of what the US had done up to that point."
7265,"It's not like if Russia declared war in 1941 Japan would have said ""welp, we're good, war over."""
7266,No.
7267,Neither will grocery store workers.
7268,😞
7269,And we won't let them rewrite history.
7270,"[No lockdown in Sweden but Stockholm could see 'herd immunity' in weeks (cnbc.com)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/22/no-lockdown-in-sweden-but-stockholm-could-see-herd-immunity-in-weeks.html) 

&gt;“In major parts of Sweden, around Stockholm, we have reached a plateau (in new cases) and we’re already seeing the effect of herd immunity and in a few weeks’ time we’ll see even more of the effects of that."
7271,"And in the rest of the country, the situation is stable,” Dr. Anders Tegnell, chief epidemiologist at Sweden’s Public Health Agency, told CNBC on Tuesday."
7272,"So.. my wife has been pretty nervous about getting it, she's been getting tested often."
7273,She went to get a rapid test this morning.
7274,"Negative for covid, positive for the flu.. no symptoms."
7275,LMAO you shouldn’t be able to vote until you stop being an asshole so yeah your right.
7276,Come on guys let's just wear a mask and stay home...
7277,"That's right folks, over 100 million people in this country that do not give a shit about anything but themselves."
7278,That is because of the propaganda of success the state TV is doing.
7279,Although not sure how long it will work with 600+ officially dying per day of covid and at twice that number looking at excess deaths.
7280,If all those people pulled out the sticks from their assess we could have lessened the impact of this virus and all the health care workers would have a less stressful life.
7281,How is this possible in the US?
7282,I thought we always have such a big problem with food waste.
7283,Also long lines for food might just indicate people hoarding for food (like they do toilet paper) rather than a true need.
7284,"At my local grocer, you can get a loaf of bread for 99c, good amount of chicken breast for 3-4$, etc."
7285,For $10 i can last a week if i actually pick and choose carefully
7286,Yeah except people who get cancer from second hand smoke live with or are close with someone who smokes.
7287,They're not getting cancer from walking by a smoker a few times on a sidewalk.
7288,"Gotcha, yeah most/all antibiotics are not something used for viruses."
7289,"The human body is pretty amazing at fighting viruses, and most times we have to get the virus for us to be able to fight it, either via a vaccine, or the virus itself."
7290,The reason why we have not faired well with this is most likely due to our immune systems not being as robust due to a slew of things.
7291,She got more than she bargained for.
7292,I have a feeling that is not true
7293,Purchase an air purifier.
7294,Good quality.
7295,No crap ones.
7296,Probably looking at about 200-300 bucks for a real good one.
7297,&gt;Funny how this is the only vaccine even considered to be mandatory.
7298,I know right?
7299,"Out of all the crazy diseases, *this* is the first vaccine that ends up being (almost) mandatory."
7300,Who did he tell you that to?
7301,"It’s because they have a President even more right wing than trump, and they love him."
7302,Ripping apart their own country because their ego is too fragile to admit they were wrong about “it’s just the flu”.
7303,Its like you read 3 sentences on the WWII wiki page and decided to post this.
7304,How misguided are you?
7305,Awesome to hear you’re safe and with family as well!
7306,I honestly wish I’d done it sooner - it’s such a night and day mental difference from trying to deal with this year on my own.
7307,"May this be over soon, but I hope you and your folks are staying safe in the meantime!"
7308,"There's a middle ground between not accepting that he apparently changed his mind after months of pressure but not forgetting he was selfishly behaving at a moment when he could (and should) have lead by example, and praising him every time he appears on an article because he is the freaking pope."
7309,not under this governmant.
7310,"we're turning pro russia, totalitary state with high church influence."
7311,"governmant supports polish 'patriots', which are in fact religious fanatics, anti-women, anti-lgbt bullies throwing rocks at people who want to their life free."
7312,"they're taking steps to ban lgbt marches, they fired constitutional tribunal's judges (which are suppose to serve until death) and put their own pro-governmant people in their place, which led this year to revoking progressive abortion laws - now abortion is legal only if pregnency is threatening mother's life (abortion from rape or fetus' serious defects are now banned)."
7313,Plus there is no strong oposition for governing party - even though oposition had a majority of votes in recent elections those votes were all split among few oposition parties.
7314,So does all worry regarding covid end once the vaccine reaches the priority groups or the general population?
7315,Not quite.
7316,"His position was not immediately dissolved after the war, in part to get the Japanese to accept occupation."
7317,"But the the 1947 constitution, written under supervision by the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP) stripped him of all nominal power."
7318,"He was left as a symbolic figurehead (which was more then he deserved frankly), more akin to the Queen of England currently."
7319,"Ultimately, the US remolded the Japanese government and constitution, not exactly in line with what the Japanese were demanding prior to getting nuked."
7320,It’s definitely higher.
7321,TSA is reporting extremely high foot traffic through airports this last weekend.
7322,All those people are going somewhere and it’s most likely not a cabin to isolate.
7323,"Lots of people are relying on a negative COVID test from last week, totally disregarding their travel plans potential to infect."
7324,"You’ve got millions of people traveling through the same airports, sharing space on planes, going out to eat with the family, then going to a giant family gathering on Thursday."
7325,What could go wrong?
7326,I don't know why you're being downvoted either.
7327,Retail workers are not law enforcement and are not paid enough to deal with this shit.
7328,We've already seen several stories of people being violently attacked or even shot because they asked someone to wear a mask.
7329,"One more problem is, the government removed detailed statistics from voivideships after the discrepancy between the numbers of cases in them and the overall number exceeded 22k cases, which was found by a 19yo guy who was consolidating the data as a hobby."
7330,Now nobody knows for sure how many cases there are actually.
7331,The officials hide the actual numbers.
7332,dos semanas mas!
7333,Lockdowns without a support program to help those without income are pointless.
7334,Why can't the USA just try a two month trial?
7335,Combine it with a national lockdown and you'd have COVID under control by March and no one else would have to die unnecessarily.
7336,You print the world's money supply.
7337,You have the power.
7338,"I respect their fighting spirit and quest for self-autonomy, though it seems to have been hijacked by bad faith figureheads of the far-right in recent years."
7339,I'm guessing you don't live somewhere warm and/or don't have to wear glasses.
7340,"Don't worry, I am for equality in disenfranchisement."
7341,You shouldn't be able to vote until you have proven yourself.
7342,"Suffice it to say, you fail."
7343,"""may?!?!?!?"""
7344,"how about ""absolutely""!"
7345,You should not be hanging around or LOOKING at UVC lamps!
7346,And how many do you want to bet haven't even considered the testing and quarantine requirements for when they head home?
7347,"They'll ignore that, too."
7348,Sometimes you just have to drop a math bomb to keep everyone on their toes.
7349,I’m fully aware that math + Reddit always = trouble.
7350,I know a guy who lost the letter T on his keyboard from a fight last year here.
7351,It’s no joke.
7352,"Same, not to make light of people who are sick-sick but that’s how my anxiety has had me this year."
7353,I forgot the word for “box” yesterday.
7354,A dozen times a day I get reminded about something I fucked up by my boss and I think he is running out of patience.
7355,Yesterday seems like a year ago and March feels like yesterday.
7356,You're correct.
7357,Dry ice would probably work better.
7358,Meets the temperature requirement and probably cheaper.
7359,K just don’t take up a bed at the hospital if your dumb ass gets sick.
7360,Deal?
7361,Go for it.
7362,Wind up in the hospital with Covid then maybe sepsis....put you on your belly so you can breathe.....right before ventilator needed and then 50/50 shot....
7363,"A top US doctor said that these results are ""science by press release."""
7364,"So, I wouldn't dig to deep into this now."
7365,"A lot of information is very obscure, and to be honest, I'd rather focus on the positive news, the BioNTech and Moderna vaccines."
7366,[removed]
7367,&gt; but it won't be hard to find a doctor willing to write one for you for any reason.
7368,That's why they will have to improve the system to make it something that cant be forged and cant be transferred to someone else.
7369,Ideally something that you cant lose would be good too.
7370,&gt; Yes but actually no.
7371,Found the Russian
7372,Our government is really showing it’s true priorities and our dependence on capitalism is going to quite literally be the death of us.
7373,I hope this is like those apocalypse movies where some of us manage to avoid becoming zombies.
7374,"As a rural hospital worker, I call BS that they can't afford to pay for travel nurses."
7375,"My hospital is part of a larger system (as most are) and took away our 401k match, doesn't pay hazard pay, gave us a one-time-only $400 ""give thanks bonus"" this week, cancelled annual raises, is operating over capacity, patients are on cots in hallways, and we're working over our stated nurse-patient ratios (we usually get 4 or 5 patients, but we're somehow more supposed to safely care for 7-8.)"
7376,"Oh, and **and they just posted a $3 billion (that's billion with a B) quarterly profit."
7377,** Bullshit they can't pay us more.
7378,"The problem is, they aren't willing to pay us more, so people are leaving."
7379,I hope they do and pay for it.
7380,I'm all for wearing masks.
7381,I just think there should be a choice.
7382,Lol arrested over Thanksgiving dinner.
7383,Weirdest times I ever lived in were the last 4 years.
7384,"They're not the only ones talking about doing it, though."
7385,"But we will see, maybe it won't be forced upon everyone."
7386,"I'd rather take it than being anti-vaccer, even though it's been rushed AF."
7387,"But this is going to make people more hesitant to vaccines in general, wich in the long run I think is not worth it."
7388,"the fonts, the size and all are really bad."
7389,"Agree on all points, even the last."
7390,&lt;Putting on tinfoil hat&gt; one could interpret it as lots of disparate pieces all coming together.
7391,Weird times.
7392,"But yeah, I'd probably go through the same in your 48 hour scenario."
7393,But I don't do anything until I've done at least *some* research on my own to at least have some pros/cons to even weigh.
7394,sounds like a nutcase alright.
7395,i pray she doesn’t kill ppl with that outlandish rhetoric.
7396,&gt;What about the rights of those of us don't want to be infected by someone who is unvaccinated?
7397,That's what you get vaccinated for.
7398,So many people are going to skip quarantine and testing requirements and just go back to work on Monday.
7399,Sorry to hear you're upset 😄
7400,"J&amp;J is one shot, which is really good tbh if it works."
7401,Hmmmm has it hit the overpopulated refugee homes and camps?
7402,It's 1k deaths a day with half attempted lockdown measures and 2k a day with lax measures.
7403,I don't even need a calculator to be concerned.
7404,"Bruh, I'm Asian."
7405,close it down.
7406,this is a failed year.
7407,Start again fresh August
7408,"Or when you see that multiple friends of yours in their 30’s have gotten *really fucking sick*, you’ll take it even more seriously."

7410,Don't own a horse tyvm
7411,Please do.
7412,Many employers are lackluster at best enforcing mask rules.
7413,Newsmax is on cable while I think OANN is mainly online.
7414,There’s also a live YouTube of Newsmax that I always check to see what the new reason for not conceding is.
7415,It does feel like they’re slowly moving towards accepting the results as certifications are now being announced but don’t want to lose viewers like Fox.
7416,"It’s going to get harder and harder, but I guess they’ll come up with something or run with whatever Trump says that is basically him saying he’s conceding without really saying it (kind of like the whole GSA thing)."
7417,"I’m feeling these next four years will be a schism in the Republican Party, especially if they lose the Georgia Senate races."
7418,They’ll have to regroup and decide if they want to keep going down this Trump road or find someone new to be the face of the party.
7419,"I have no doubt Trump will run in 2024 regardless, but I am interested to see who his Republican challenger will be."
7420,I just saw 64% somewhere.
7421,"I'm an essential worker, but I don't work in a grocery store or hospital, so I'm pretty much invisible."
7422,That’s why I paid cash for my test.
7423,In 10 years you’ll be checking a box for whether or not you’ve ever had Covid when you are trying to get insurance and it’s going to cost you money.
7424,"14 European countries had much higher death rates than the US yesterday, remains to be seen if the US actually reaches those levels"
7425,rather not do either
7426,Atleast they show that vitamin D deficiency doesn't help.
7427,"So unless you eat lot of fish or live somewhere where you get plenty of sunshine outdoors, basic suplaments is good idea during winter."
7428,Like I said I'm all for masks.
7429,Just making a comparison.
7430,I just think people should still have a choice if we are free.
7431,~~Luck~~ Hard work
7432,No problem!
7433,You're fired.
7434,Enjoy your freedumbs!
7435,&gt;  ...population the death rate in Poland is currently 4x of the US ...
7436,According to https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ overall coronavirus death rate in Poland is less than half of the US.
7437,(802 vs. 396 per million).
7438,"BTW: Sweden - 647, Italy - 849, Spain - 934."
7439,The new cases and deaths skyrocketed after the government relaxed restrictions and allowed children to go to schools in September.
7440,Ever since then government handling of the pandemic has been a disaster.
7441,They timed very controversial changes to the law hoping that people would not hit the streets in protests but they were wrong.
7442,The current government is a disaster in just about everything else but that is OT.
7443,My family already did when they had Thanksgiving last weekend.
7444,My brothers and I weren't invited because we told our parents it was a bad idea.
7445,A completely misleading headline.
7446,This test only *measures the amount of neutralizing antibody that is present.
7447,"* As the article clearly states,

&gt;The FDA cautioned that much remains unknown about the nature of Covid-19  neutralizing antibodies in humans and that a high level of antibodies  does not necessarily guarantee immunity against the virus."
7448,This test will *facilitate further research on this subject.
7449,"* In concert with ongoing research into tests of T-cell immunity, it may eventually result in a combination test that will eventually show ""how well someone is protected against the virus."""
7450,"But this test does not do that, as the article clearly states."
7451,I hope your 11 female staff and family don't start dying because of you.
7452,10 people vaccinated at 70% is much better than one at 95% (considering price and distribution).
7453,"Yeah, because they're testing more."

7462,Now you’re peddling lies and challenging details from everyone.
7463,"They were arrogant, thought they knew better and gambled with their entire society and lost."
7464,The same contempt for everyone else they had when selling ball bearings and cold steel to the nazis in WW2
7465,It is a valid explanation though.
7466,Data is useless without analysis.
7467,I'm going to stay inside and hide for the next four months.
7468,"Well when people hear “essential workers” they think of front line grocery store employees but what about the people that work in the distribution centers, the people that work for the food manufacturers and their distribution centers, the people who manufacture truck parts, work at truck repair shops etc."
7469,"I work in a factory, but my business is essential to the trucking industry but nobody ever thinks of us when they think of essential workers."
7470,"Does anyone know of a mask supplier that sells decent reusable masks that have something along the lines of ""I support healthcare workers"" written on it?"
7471,I think its time to show people just why we are wearing the masks.

7473,They are basically confused Mega Protestants.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Sweden Sees No Signs So Far Herd Immunity Is Stopping Virus  
&gt;  
&gt; There’s little evidence that herd immunity is helping Sweden combat the coronavirus, according to the country’s top epidemiologist."
7477,Does this change your mind?
7478,"I realize it is not ""forced"", it's just that everybody will require it."
7479,Completely different thing.

7481,Lol.
7482,Great analogy.
7483,One little oversight and now you have an 18 year commitment.

7550,"My worry is (and i am not from US), that governments, media and people perhaps focus too much on the mortality rates and death count and therefore under estimate the severity of this global pandemic."

7552,"this virus seems to cause and what we still even \~year later, know much less about."
7553,"What negative effects could that have on society, its functioning, economy, healthcare etc, if this thing keeps on running rampant and eventually ends up infecting, lets say half of a nations population."

&gt; and if you want you can dive into [the paper they linked](https://alzres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13195-020-00640-3) 

Which i did."
7568,Originally back in June when these types of articles first came out around this paper.
7569,"And the funny part is, that when it was posted to reddit back then the general consensus was this would be alarming if true but we need a wayy larger sample size."
7570,This whole thing is dependent on a paper that came out in JUNE.
7571,And then some questions sent to some local physicians.
7572,There HAS to be more concrete evidence around this by now.
7573,And if not then why is it still being brought up as news now.
7574,You're going to tell me freaking 5 months after this concern was originally raised the same paper from 5 months ago is your only source.
7575,"Now lets say this article linked to that original paper from june, AND pointed to another independent paper with similar findings from September-November."
7576,THEN we have a freaking value add to the original source.
7577,THEN the 20 minutes I took out my day to read this article would be worth it.
7578,Because its adding more smoke to the original claim.
7579,We're dealing with educated and researched googlers who want to debate claims.
7580,Dont make it easy for them.
7581,So yea i came with an axe to grind.
7582,And it was one to hope for higher standards when we share reports / articles around one of the scariest world wide issues we've seen in a long time

7584,https://i.imgur.com/mClDFrr.jpeg
7585,"lol and those will be lifted in mid December, even in Sydney."
7586,"Meanwhile hospitals are getting overwhelmed in the states, very few schools having classes in person, can’t go to big sporting events... need i go on?"
7587,"To be fair, driving too fast could too."

7593,Show me the part of the constitution that says rights can be suspended in the situation you describe.
7594,"As someone with a grandmother with severe dementia, thankyou, thankyou, thankyou."
7595,"Because of people like you my grandmother got fast, adequate care, and survived COVID with a whole bunch of underlying conditions(and honestly, they've been doing an insanely great job of keeping COVID out, as well - she was unlucky enough to be one of 40 or so in a facility with a couple thousand residents)."
7596,"Visitation is shut down again but I got a chance to see her a couple times over the summer(complete with a disposable body-condom for hugging), and I was struck by how well she was actually doing, how well she comprehended what was going on - no doubt it's due to the quality of care she's been recieving."
7597,"I literally want to cry writing this post, because I worry about her and her quality of life so much, especially in a post-COVID world."
7598,The work you do means so much to me and so many others out there.
7599,"I'm infinitely thankful to the people working there, and to you, too, for the work you do for other families."
7600,"Such an extremely difficult, and often thankless and underpaid job."
7601,I am so grateful.
7602,Well at least we both had some laughs at the end here.
7603,None of the inmates did this.
7604,"This is a scammer using inmates, which is common, because you know they will not be filing claims therefore you avoid the detection through duplicate claims issue."
7605,"And death row inmate's names are easy to find, or known like Peterson."
7606,"Just watch, this will be either a massive outside prison scam, or someone in prison running it and none of the names even had a clue they were being used."
7607,"Thanks for the insight, I have a lot to learn about this issue."
7608,Let’s hope that it gets addressed by the new administration — it is looking extremely dire.
7609,"Yeah, I was going to say."
7610,"I’ve seen my grandmother once or twice since this started, but it was outdoors and masked in a low infection area."
7611,"We were safe, and I think it helped our mental health too."
7612,"Can't you meet them with masks, in an open space and distancing?"
7613,Not really sure how Thanksgiving social dynamics work but I guess that's an option.
7614,They still get the normal unemployment benefits that everyone in normal times relies on between jobs.
7615,It's a shitty situation but letting the virus run rampant without restriction is not free of costs either.
7616,"&gt;there is no easy fix to this right now, even with all our medical advances."
7617,"There is actually, but that is only for the rich and presidents."
7618,Because demanding unconditional surrender while murdering a nation's civilian population is morally reprehensible.
7619,"Because up to that point, almost no war in recent history ended with the ""unconditional surrender"" of one side."
7620,"Rather, it was customary for both sides to negotiate a mutually satisfactory peace treaty."
7621,Because the United States had no right to be in Asia in the first place.
7622,"Japan wasn't bothering anyone until U.S. warships sailed into their harbors in 1853 and forced Japan to sign an unfavorable trade treaty, which led European powers to do the same."
7623,"After which Japan watched as America and Europe colonized the entire rest of Asia, created a mass opium epidemic in China, murdered 3 million civilians in the Philippines and exterminated the indigenous population of Australia and New Zealand."
7624,"Because the United States would go on to commit mass murder in Korea, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, and to this day impose its will on the people of Asia through a massive network of military bases that threaten to bring death and destruction to the people of Asia at any moment."
7625,Because America can go fuck itself and leave the rest of the world alone for once.

7635,I work in a fairly large southern CA district.
7636,The California Teacher Association (CTA) is running this whole “Only when it’s safe” campaign.
7637,General education teachers are not required to begin in-person teaching.
7638,"In fact, special education teachers are not required to either, but have to complete in-person assessments with their students."
7639,"But DIS service providers (Speech language pathologists, occupational therapists, adaptive PE teachers, and schools psychs/counselors) were told we had to offer and resume in-person services."
7640,"However, our teachers are given the option to teach virtually from their classrooms, and at my school site like 75% of teachers are working on site."
7641,Which pisses me off.
7642,"I HAVE to go in, and teachers who CAN work from home are making the irresponsible decision to come in and increasing my exposure."
7643,"When I brought this up the local branch of the teachers union president, she ccd in our CTA point person."
7644,I basically said it was frustrating that they were placing teachers convenience above literally my life.
7645,The CTA guy basically told me they would NOT restrict the number of teachers on campus and they had no ability to help with the fact that I’m being forced to come on site.
7646,"When I pointed out the fact that “Only when it’s safe” campaign should have a disclaimer that it did NOT in fact include special education (clearly it’s not safe or ALL teachers would come back), he basically said that was true, and that resuming in person special education services was 100% decided by the district and the union was powerless."
7647,I’m debating on jumping ship out of the public school system now that I know what my health and life are worth.
7648,"My district is in a hotspot and we recently had 4 employees who had been working on site tested positive, so I feel like it’s just a matter of time before I get sick."

7658,Their officials and office holders have proven to be too inept to handle this and should be left out of the process.
7659,We want to help the people but we can't trust who they voted for anymore to do the right thing.
7660,Moderna!
7661,Sorry
7662,what you mean they don't really have a choice?

7684,"You can be condescending all you want, but like you aren’t really doing anything lol."
7685,The data fir  this trial is a mess because of combining two different studies.
7686,Wired has a good article about the messy data that was posted.
7687,I’ll find it and link it here.
7688,Edit: here’s the link to that post:[data isn’t up to snuff](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/k0tsam/the_astrazeneca_covid_vaccine_data_isnt_up_to)
7689,"Food stamp amounts have been cut and the duration has been shortened in most/all states (unless you have kids, possibly) since the Great Recession."
7690,"Nowadays you can only get them for 3 months within the span of 2 years in the states I've lived in, unless you are working 20+ hours a week and still qualify (but the income limits are so low that few people fall into that category)."
7691,"If you are not working, you have to be looking for a job and some states require you to do volunteer hours."
7692,We haven't had a social safety net really since Clinton's welfare reform in the 90s cut everything down to the bare minimum.
7693,"TANF (what people think of when they say welfare - it is a cash benefit) is not anywhere near enough to cover non-food expenses such as rent and utilities, is also very short in duration, and only applies to certain households with kids."
7694,"Add to that stagnant wages and inflation, no increase to min wage, higher rents, etc."
7695,and it's not really difficult to imagine.
7696,"SSI is around $700/mo for those who are able to get on it, but they also usually can't work so that's -all- the income they have aside from food stamps and section 8 if they are lucky enough to qualify."
7697,Section 8 waiting lists are enormously long (for housing) and where I live 70% of vouchers are forfeited because so few apartments will accept it as payment for rent.
7698,If you've been in/around food banks and food pantries in the last several years as a volunteer or worker it's pretty obvious that this issue has been simmering under the surface for years - you had to line up and wait for hours behind at least a hundred or two hundred other people at the food pantry nearest me even before the pandemic.
7699,"It's just now slightly more visible because more ""middle class"" families are falling into the cracks, and working class folks were hit so hard by business closures."
7700,Pretty easy to check if you’ve been shadowbanned.

7704,"I know a few families that aren't making any changes, sure."
7705,"I know some families that aren't meeting anyone else, too."
7706,"But I also know a lot of families, mine included, that are planning smaller gatherings and/or outdoor gatherings."
7707,"Those families are mitigating some risks but still taking some, too."
7708,"But unfortunately she doesn’t have the power to mandate a lot of the things, for example the new rules she wants in schools can only be mandated by state leaders."
7709,That’s the way the german government works.
7710,She can only offer advice and suggestions to them.
7711,"But that being said, they did a really good job with the first wave, all the way through til October and they are still doing better than a lot of other European countries."
7712,But it’s not good enough.
7713,Luckily masks are already mandated since April in germany and we just need to clamp down on schools and private gatherings for the numbers to come down.
7714,Have you actually worn a proper FFP2 mask in cold weather?
7715,It gets wet almost instantly.
7716,The water has nowhere to go.
7717,FFP3 is a bit more comfortable because the water drips out of the seal.
7718,"Come on, guys, don't exaggerate the issue."
7719,The leftovers will taste fine; it takes several days for symptoms to develop and several more days to compromise lung function to the point where external ventilation is required for survival.

7736,This is just a defense mechanism you’re using so that you don’t have to accept other people’s opinions.
7737,You’re using a tactic where everyone who even strays an inch from everything you believe to be true is somehow stupid and uneducated.
7738,"While this works to inflate your ego, it works against you in everything else, such as outreach, discussion, and attempting to influence people into your mindset."

&gt;Messenger RNA is a single strand of the genetic code that cells can ""read"" and use to make a protein."
7777,"In the case of this vaccine, the mRNA instructs cells in the body to make the particular piece of the virus's spike protein."
7778,"Then the immune system sees it, recognizes it as foreign and is prepared to attack when actual infection occurs."

&gt;MRNA is very fragile so it's encased in lipid nanoparticles -- a coating of a buttery substance that can melt at room temperature."

7799,"Trueeee, little Asian kid locked up in his dorm room has determined and planned the whole covid-19 strategy for Sweden, when do I get my check for the work iv put in?"
7800,I can't wait for the freedom train people to infect my parents at the grocery store and kill them.
7801,Good for them.
7802,Worth it.
7803,"You have a higher chance of spreading it if you go in, many are not going to quarantine for 2 weeks after."
7804,Ebola was spread rapidly because of the tradition of funerals.
7805,Doctors know what they are doing.
7806,Does it suck...yes.
7807,So that’s why we need to try hard to stop the spread of this disease.
7808,I get that.
7809,But I think we also have to consider the social contracts necessary to maintain a safe and functioning society.
7810,"If people want to participate and gain all the benefits of a functioning society, they need to adhere to a certain set of rules that ensure the stability and safety of the society."
7811,I think vaccines fall in this category.
7812,"It's so goddamn frustrating being safe and isolating my family, making ourselves all lonely and bored and depressed, and then hearing about how our relatives are gathering and having a gay ol time just like every other year."
7813,Chances are they won't even see any negative consequences.
7814,And I'll be sitting over here wondering when I'll ever be able to eat in a restaurant again.
7815,Fuck everything about this.
7816,For once I agree with this guy.
7817,If the pope and everyone else is telling you to put on your mask and you're not?
7818,There's something seriously wrong with your head.
7819,Some of the counties reporting a lot of cases are pretty small; also note the new cases vs existing cases -- the Texas outbreak is widespread and seriously impacting small-town counties.
7820,"Texas is a mess.. and those small-town counties are bastions of anti-maskers, I can't imagine things are going to go well after Thanksgiving."
7821,"Going to be a lot of family gatherings that end badly, IMHO."
7822,All of it.
7823,"Broken clock, and what on earth are you talking about regarding a “reset”?"
7824,Too late...
7825,Anyone who watched the NBA Draft knows many people are going to gathering for Thanksgiving.
7826,"Briefings are on Tuesday and Thursday, number updates are from Tuesday until Friday."
7827,"A bit late with the update on numbers today, sorry."
7828,"* 210 patients are with COVID-19 in ICU currently, this is quite an increase compared to both last week and yesterday."
7829,"* SBC released some numbers on how the pandemic has affected the life expectancy in Sweden - 

&gt;**Life expectancy in Sweden is expected to fall this year**  
&gt;  
&gt;Life expectancy in Sweden will most likely fall this year as a result of the corona pandemic, according to a report from Statistics Sweden."
7830,"&gt;  
&gt;That it drops between two years has been unusual since the beginning of the 20th century."
7831,"&gt;  
&gt;The forecast from Statistics Sweden shows that life expectancy for both women and men will most likely fall this year."
7832,From 84.7 to 84.4 years for women and from 81.3 to 80.8 years for men.
7833,"&gt;  
&gt;The forecast is based on the number of deaths during January to August this year."
7834,"&gt;  
&gt;""In our main forecast, in addition to the observed death rates, we have calculated the same death rates for October to December as for 2019."
7835,"But depending on the assumptions made for the last months of the year, life expectancy may be higher or lower than that,"" says Örjan Hemström, demographer at Statistics Sweden."
7836,", in a press release."
7837,"&gt;  
&gt;According to Statistics Sweden, life expectancy has increased steadily in Sweden during the period 1900–2019."
7838,It is unusual for life expectancy to decrease between two years.
7839,"&gt;  
&gt;Between 1 January and 31 August this year, almost 6,500 more deaths occurred than in the same period in 2019."
7840,"There are 4,800 more deaths than expected based on the latest population projection for 2020, Statistics Sweden writes."
7841,"&gt;  
&gt;""Such a long period of increased mortality is very likely to lead to lower life expectancy."
7842,"Most extra deaths compared to the previous year have occurred in older ages, but it looks like the death rate may be higher in 2020 than 2019 in all age groups,"" says Örjan Hemström according to the press release."
7843,"(TT)

**Please, remember there is lag in reporting and deaths reported on a certain day are usually mostly deaths that happened on previous days."
7844,"On average it takes up to 11 days to report 90% of the deaths for a certain day (see in the links graphs about how that looks)**

7860,"The more ya know, right?"
7861,Call 9/11 whatever you want but there's nothing cowardly about hijacking a plane with a box cutter and crashing it into the symbols of everything you hate.
7862,Those people were ballsy as hell and actually died for what they believed in.
7863,"My mom canceled Thanksgiving bc her and my wife are very close, and my wife is a ER nurse here in NY."
7864,She told my mother that the ER is wall to wall covid again and my mother decided she wouldn't risk it for her or my dad who is 79 with high blood pressure and diabetic.
7865,"If I'm being honest tho, my mom was worried about it from the get go and wanted a reason to cancel it."
7866,And as a Polish citizen I can now add that government started to do much less tests to improve data or its their idea to make less people sick (i can expect everything from them).
7867,Poland is North Korea of Europe with its propaganda.
7868,"But don’t worry, we can decrease the recommended quarantine time and the virus will be like, ok I won’t spread now."
7869,This same thing happened to my extended family and in TX too.
7870,"They had a family reunion, kids where carriers and nobody knew, everyone got sick, some pretty badly."
7871,"Fortunately they ""got lucky"" but AFAIK, they're still out and about."
7872,"From the article you linked,

""*Deep in that document, and apparently overlooked by reporters and commentators, was an eyebrow-raising suggestion: Under a section marked “Interim and primary analyses of the primary outcome,” the trialists outline a plan to combine and analyze data from four clinical trials (only half of which are Phase 3), carried out in different ways on three different continents."
7873,"The plan, they wrote, was to pull out results only for the people across these four trials who had gotten ""two standard-dose vaccines,"" and then pool those together for what's called a meta-analysis."
7874,"*

*The appendix doesn’t say when this became the plan."
7875,We don’t even know if the Oxford-AstraZeneca team followed it.
7876,"In fact, it’s impossible to know, at this point, just how many analyses these researchers have run, and on which data."

7893,I had remarked that trick-or-treating this past Halloween was unnecessary and irresponsible during a pandemic and wasn't a big deal to skip this year...
7894,I was pretty much pilloried for it.
7895,"So no, I definitely don't expect them to forgo thanksgiving, as it's even higher up on the totem pole of celebrations as far as they are concerned."
7896,"On the other hand I only found a single Cornish hen, aparently that’s the go-to for those of us going it alone, so it’s not everyone"
7897,Is there any evidence that COVID-19 affects the behavior of its hosts to maximize reproductive opportunities for the virus?
7898,"Hard to do that without knowing what vaccines or adverse events you're referring to -- I think I can take a guess, and feel *very* comfortable saying that the chance of those are vanishingly unlikely, but I don't want to put words in your mouth."
7899,Mind sharing what particular vaccines or adverse effects are concerning you?
7900,Large hospitals can segregate and limit exposure better.
7901,Host two sets of staff for positive and negative cases.
7902,Contactless administrative functions.
7903,Specialized departments.
7904,Rural will be more hands on with less people involved in the process and higher individual risk.

7906,No it’s fine!
7907,I wasn’t sure if I misread it so that’s why I asked.
7908,I agree that we should feel joy for those we love that are healthy.
7909,Cool let’s do it
7910,I’m sorry some people downvoted you.
7911,You ask excellent questions and I’ve had the same questions.
7912,I’ve been hoping that some group behind the scenes has been working on that (how can they not??)
7913,but we’ve heard desperately little about it in the news.
7914,An old school yellow fever card seems like a poor solution in the digital age if we are going to need this passport frequently.
7915,"But when there's a big crowd, there's bound to be people not wearing masks, so the chances of a sick person not wearing a mask spreading their germs around are pretty high."
7916,"It won't change all minds, though."
7917,"Some people are just too stubborn, indoctrinated, and emotionally broken to ever consider they might have been wrong about this."
7918,There are literally people who will die in some decades' time 100% certain that Trump was a saint and COVID was a hoax.
7919,"Good one, eh?"
7920,I probably phrased it poorly.
7921,I was advocating for people to feel joy that your loved ones are healthy and safe.
7922,Keep them that way by being smart.

7925,It’s been 8months of this...
7926,For the most part smoking doesn’t result in harming others on such a large scale.
7927,"And that’s not taking into account the tobacco lobby’s attempts to say it was good for people back in the day via fake authorities, so it’s not quite the same."
7928,I vote you sue if they aren't following guidelines.
7929,Keep a copy of your email and track your conversations with everyone.
7930,Ok that's fine for most vaccines.
7931,I have previously read of (obviously OTHER) vaccines that have side effects that don't rear their ugly heads until MANY months after administration.
7932,"Guarantee for all of us that these new vaccines with no long term history of safety and made with an entirely new process, won't have similar timelines for adverse effects."

7946,I’m pretty disappointed.
7947,"I have some friends in NYC who are very smart and usually very rational, but they will be visiting family for both holidays this year."
7948,“It’s not that bad where my parents live” and “the positivity rate is pretty good in NYC right now” are both excuses they’ve given.
7949,Can’t believe they can’t sit holidays out for one damn year.

7961,There was evidence of a disease similar to Kawasaki's in the US several months ago.
7962,But like this article says it's like 1 in 1000 kids.
7963,So if you have 100k infected kids only 100 or so are going to have this.

7967,Thanks for answering this.
7968,What makes you so confident that CommonPass will be the vaccine passport we use?

7970,"Same with abortion, severe body modification, ect."
7971,For example.
7972,Are we going to determine that all animals and pets should be killed because there is someone allergic to dogs.
7973,Or that no one is allowed to eat peanuts because I am allergic to it?
7974,Oh you see know benefit to people being free to live their lives?
7975,"And I’ll repeat, there is no doubt their economy is doing better than it would be if they enforced lockdowns and their standing is largely impacted by the lockdowns of their neighboring countries."
7976,"It honestly doesn't imply anything as it could just be a person's informal writing style to use ellipses at the end of a sentence like that...

Interestingly enough, it's a common trait for those who have ADHD or similar conditions, which I do have, but I digress..."
7977,"It seems that you took the fact that I used three periods in a row instead of one as a cause to assume what my intent was, and unfortunately you were wrong in both counts, I was merely just proposing an explanation for why different sources have different end-of-day numbers and not trying to imply anything other than that possibility nor try to get into an argument over anything...

&gt; “or they are just using different hours foe the day ~~idiot, isnt that obvious~~?"
7978,"If you just stopped that sentence at the word ""day"", we'd be on the same page there, Idk why you took three periods instead of one to mean that I was being way more hostile than I was."
7979,"I honestly don't know why your mind automatically defaulted to those two extreme possibilities rather than any of the dozens of more civil possibilities including the very simple and actual one, which was ""Maybe they are just using different hours to call the days' numbers?"""
7980,It's frustrating that we must be the ones always sacrificing.
7981,Why are restaurants still allowed to have dine in customers?
7982,Why are bars still open?
7983,Why are retail outlets allowed to participate in black friday?

7989,If you are warned multiple times you are going to get burned if you touch a flame or say you are overweight and warned over and over again that you could die and you dont do anything to help yourself...then the onus is on you.
7990,People feel like the science doesn't apply to their family...Covid doesnt care.

8046,You can't compare 1 person potentially infecting multiple people by refusing to wear a mask to 1 person who wears a mask and has to go to the store for food or medicine.
8047,1 increases the risk for other people and is totally selfish and the other is just attemtping to survive.
8048,The comparison isn't even a valid argument.

8050,Good lord y'all need hobbies.
8051,You can't determine what someone does with there body.

8060,"I'm proud of who I am and where I'm from, and also happy for others who are proud about where they are from too."

8080,Dumb as a rock.
8081,My wife asks me if we're killing the planet.
8082,I like to reassure her that we're not killing the planet.
8083,"The planet will be fine, we're simply destroying our ability to live in it."
8084,Somehow she doesn't find comfort in that
8085,Someone's triggered haha.
8086,That's a leap.
8087,"And please don't call me a sheep, at least masks help the situation and trying to protect people."
8088,Plus it's respecting the fact that you can get others sick.
8089,"It's a public health crisis, not a political opinion."
8090,[removed]
8091,"No, the opposite."
8092,My brother works in restaurants and he confirmed his restaurant has had large parties continuously throughout COVID in violation of Governor mandate.
8093,It also helps with overall distribution.
8094,"Those X number of people don’t have to worry about where they will get it, take up an appointment slot (or however it will work), etc."
8095,"&gt;thumbs up to cops

Fucken hell we are a pathetic city"
8096,"That's Covid-19, not the vaccine, you complete utter peanut."
8097,Hospitalizations have consistently throughout the pandemic followed cases by 2 weeks.
8098,"If trends follow, hospitalizations will continue to increase."
8099,The problem is people not being able to be treated due to there being too many people in hospitals.
8100,How do we treat people we have no room for?
8101,"The counter-point is that Moderna and Pfizer are apparently using every available piece of equipment in the world that can make more mRNA vaccines, and they're still 15x more expensive per dose than the vectored vaccine doses."
8102,So it's not like making more mRNA vaccines would give us more doses faster.
8103,"(I don't have direct sources for either of these statements, and they should be taken with a grain of salt; this is just what I've read on here and /r/COVID19."
8104,"In particular the Pfizer vaccine is supposed to be priced ""below market rates"" at $40 a dose, and the Oxford one is supposed to be $2.50 per dose.)"
8105,I think the argument about which is better is pretty pointless.
8106,We didn't know which was better so we tried them all - it was the right choice.
8107,It even makes sense in the case of Sputnik using two different vaccines for its two doses.
8108,"Looks like long term mRNA is going to be better, which is pretty good news."
8109,So in other words it will be illegal to continue to mask-up in a public building after the vaccine is out?
8110,Schools and large employers were also used to fight Polo as well.
8111,A large factory employees thousands of people and they are already collected at a single point meaning you can inoculate lots of people in a short time.
8112,The freezes that Ford buys will likely be sold at a much lower cost if not donated (good PR) to areas that cannot afford them new.

8114,Glad I don’t live there then
8115,This is nothing but mayor talking out of his ass with no enforcement
8116,It's because phones are made in China and China has no community transfer.
8117,USA and Malaysia are not covid-free.
8118,"""Save people or economy"" is a false dichotomy."
8119,He got a false positive in August?
8120,That’s not what I took from the article.
8121,Where’d you get that from?
8122,Deaths will still rise
8123,"Yeah, that tends to happen."
8124,"The first death in my country was discussed for days, it was all over the news and everyone thought that was a big deal, now we are happy to see a day with only 25 deaths."
8125,"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oleandrin

For anyone curious."
8126,Extremely cardiotoxic
8127,"Yes, suspended from posting more videos for a week."
8128,Not remove the channel for one week.
8129,"Wait, isn't that the norm everywhere?"
8130,O.O
8131,It depends on what the law is.
8132,"So the under 55 half vaccine, you would compare it to those under 55 placebo."
8133,Of course it would become less statistically significant though.
8134,So is the virus getting deadlier or is it because of the spread?
8135,Wait until around December 8th after we get past the 2 week mark from Thanksgiving that will not be fun
8136,Sigh.
8137,I failed to convince a close friend yesterday to cancel her plans to visit family across county lines.
8138,She then told me that she’s going to Mexico next week for vacation.
8139,"For some context in just how disappointing this was:

She has a Masters in Public Health

She has personally created Public Health related projects in her home country."
8140,Her Dad died a painful death of COVID in August.
8141,He lived in her home country so due to COVID restrictions she couldn’t attend his funeral.
8142,"Their religious beliefs required he be buried swiftly, so they couldn’t postpone the funeral."
8143,She lives with her high risk mother and grandmother.
8144,She has a high risk 3 year old daughter who doesn’t wear a mask.
8145,"She left her job, drew unemployment, and withdrew her daughter from daycare due to exposure risk."
8146,.
8147,.
8148,.
8149,I expect most of those places will simply ask you to prove you are vaccinated.
8150,Because he used to smoke crack?

8158,I probably go through 15 n95 s a day and 10 or so regular surgical masks ( per 13 hour shift in ER).
8159,Glad to be living in Ireland these days .... absolutely heartbroken for all the health care workers without adequate PPE
8160,I can’t even tell if you’re kidding or not.
8161,This *sounds* like something OANN would say
8162,That's good.
8163,I've been demonetized twice before and shit hits hard.
8164,However they'll be able to reapply in 30 days and a lot of people have literally not changed anything and been remonetized.
8165,I think this is completely the wrong approach to get Americans to take public health measures.
8166,*I realize many of you will disagree with me.
8167,"* I have no formal qualifications in the medical/science field, but I do read a lot of literature/studies."
8168,That said I’ll explain what I would do if I was in charge of public health in this country.
8169,I would first of all broadcast individual risk of death/hospitalization/etc.
8170,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html I’d probably do this through a app for the most part.
8171,But also in the news.
8172,"Example: https://south-dakota.covid-age.com this would be my primary message, not actual deaths, and certainly not actual cases."
8173,I’d then develop guidelines that give choices.
8174,I’d probably give examples of “ultra low risk” “low risk” “medium risk” “high risk” and “ultra high risk” activities.
8175,I’d also remind Americans that they should consult with high risk individuals and ask them what they are ok with before meeting up or assuming that they want to act in the same matter you do.
8176,"But telling Americans that they won’t have a choice about taking a personal risk for months will backfire, and it will backfire hard."
8177,Especially after a vaccine.
8178,The commentary I’ve seen in the thread suggests the apparent plateau in recorded cases is a result of a lack of testing capacity.
8179,If you take the number of tests and % of positives into account it could be misleading to suggest that actual cases are plateauing or falling.
8180,That article is so negative.
8181,This is the free market in action.
8182,"If nurses are making 8k a week, it should be celebrated."
8183,It’s OK. We still love you!
8184,It's a good news.
8185,We cannot end a global pandemic without global collaboration.
8186,There's no point to say no if it could pass phase 3 experiment and may save hundreds of thousands of lives.
8187,I'm happy to take it no matter who developed it.
8188,"Lol, it's barely been half a year for Covid, it's barely gotten started yet."
8189,Why the past tense?
8190,Isn’t it still?
8191,I half expect the government don’t mind as the elderly are generally a net drain on the country.
8192,"Never mind they built decades of wealth, they’re not putting in now so off to the ice flow they go."
8193,I cannot agree more.
8194,[deleted]
8195,I paid $65 for an antibodies test in May.
8196,LabCorp saw me coming a mile away.
8197,And it only took four weeks to get the results.
8198,That’s because Reddit is not an indicator of the the rest of the world.
8199,"This website and sub is a fearmongering, virtue signaling, echo chamber"
8200,There are places with morgues absolutely backed up requesting more and more freezer trucks.
8201,"But since you apparently don’t believe any news whatsoever, there’s obviously nothing I can do to convince you."
8202,And I obviously can’t convince you to care about all the people who have been and will be hurt by this.
8203,Stay safe and I hope you don’t hurt someone else along the way.
8204,Look at growth curve past 90 and follow it for next 30 - this isn’t going down.
8205,I don’t think it was a fluke.
8206,This is growing - fast.
8207,That fact that you're reading them is a good sign though.
8208,"Hopefully because of that, few of us will be in one of them."
8209,All you need to be doing for the next year or so is surviving the day.
8210,Do you not realize the crisis we are in as a society/species?
8211,One of my grandpa's best friends was among them :'(.
8212,Wisconsin is heartbreaking right now.
8213,40 million shots = 20 million vaccinated people
8214,not over.
8215,But in spring the people that would die from it can get a vaccination before they sit down with the younger parts of their family.
8216,Probably hardly any
8217,"Yeah, we're all out partying tbh"
8218,"Is it also normal for hospitals to beg people to mask up, stay home, and otherwise protect themselves?"
8219,Is it normal for hospitals to beg the community for ppe?
8220,Is it normal for elective surgery to be canceled en masse?
8221,"In the US, we tried denial of COVID’s existence."
8222,We are all surprised that this approach didn’t work.
8223,Its not even close to half the population.
8224,"Not sure in every state, but my state has definitely waived several of residents' rights through this."
8225,Leaving the facility is only allowed for medical reasons.
8226,Families are only allowed in the facility for end of life visits.
8227,"I wouldn’t air travel, but I’m literally driving."
8228,I don’t care if I get Covid.
8229,I only care about spreading it.
8230,I’ve been hyper vigilant of avoiding people the last week and a half.
8231,And I haven’t had symptoms which &gt;95% of symptomatic cases develop in that time.
8232,A symptomatic cases should be take care of even less time.

8234,Very true
8235,"I don't want to get into some pissing contest, but people only learn when they feel motivated to learn."
8236,You or people you've witnessed might not know how to do that.
8237,I have.
8238,So there goes your pissy ass-umption.
8239,Fuuuuuuck the pain meds.
8240,Worst headaches of my damn life coming off those things.
8241,Holy shit.
8242,"Never in my life have I been in so much pain, 100X worse than any chest pain from surgery, which was minor."
8243,I'll fulfill that guy's promise and upvote you.
8244,The Name of the Rose is a great novel and the scene makes sense in context.
8245,we're also fat as fuck

8247,"Welcome back,  we all missed you"
8248,There are few things less appealing to me than being trapped on a boat with 3000 other people with diarrhea.
8249,"My sister worked in a very small facility in wisconsin, until a few weeks ago."
8250,"Apparently one employee, on the 7th hour of her 8 hour shift, stated her roommate or family member had it, and as well passed it on to about 5 employees, my sister being one of them."
8251,"My sister stopped going in because she felt sick, and wanted to get tested, so they fired her and said she should have just been working if they all had it anyway."
8252,"My sister said she couldn't do that to the residents, but it seems whoever's in charge there does not care one bit as long as they're not covering shifts."
8253,"She's not even getting her 2 weeks pay under the cares act, due to her being fired, and doesn't know how to legally go about it."
8254,Those cheeseheads are fucked up.
8255,I’m only seeing 500 hours online.
8256,"Regardless of the fact, that curriculum is still completely off-topic."
8257,"I’m not saying there aren’t good nursing programs, but that a good lot of them are unstandardized and do not churn out qualified medical workers."
8258,There is almost no medical school that is remotely unstandardized or not rigorous.
8259,"Likewise, there are similar stories about BSN programs as well, FNP, RN, whatever title."
8260,The regulation and standardization is just not there.
8261,"Colleges are realizing they can start some shitty nursing program and give a degree out for pretty much no cost, and students will still come in droves because of how much healthcare demand there is."
8262,"That’s why so many nursing programs are from odd or online colleges nobody’s heard of, and why the turnover rate for them is so high."
8263,The clinical hours is also a large point too.
8264,"Even using your number, I don’t think 2300 hours is anywhere close to the number of hours needed for one to practice independently."
8265,That’s like one year of clinical experience.
8266,Premeds I know have more experience than that.
8267,Can't help be prioritized to people who wore masks all the time?
8268,Deniers get it second if resources available.
8269,I guess that would motivate some to wear those damn masks.
8270,Now you are begging to understand Japanese culture
8271,It'll thaw pretty damn fast in my arm if it hasn't already lol
8272,im with you!
8273,i cut off a long time friend of mine and his wife after he got in my face screaming how little kids cant get it.
8274,this is my long time friend of 10 years.
8275,"changed my number and all, havent heard from them since this happened in june."
8276,fuck em.
8277,Nurses can be idiots too.
8278,Not all are obviously but on the rank of who we should listen to about a rapidly spreading virus they are just one rung above any bum on the street.
8279,"Which don’t get me wrong on that rung, but I’m listening to the people at the forefront of this field."
8280,And I can’t imagine a nurse working through this pandemic and not recommending mask wearing.
8281,It literally can’t hurt anything.
8282,In which they can make the personal choice to wear a mask.
8283,You should build a wall and make them pay for it
8284,Bottom line is I think the adenovirus route whether chimp or human is not that great for this specific pandemic.
8285,We’ve already seen the data for two mRNA vaccines and they look excellent.
8286,People argue about safety and mRNA vaccines being new but with prior knowledge bits of mRNA probably have less impact than injecting a whole virus into you.
8287,Me myself and I would say this table for 1 is safe as fuck
8288,Yet those useless temperature checks are still happening in offices right before masks come off.
8289,[deleted]
8290,I was using his name to mean the whole new administration.
8291,The red team would be better off getting a check passed before that with the Georgia two leading the charge
8292,Unless you're from Ontario where the half lockdown measures are just as dumb and you can experience it up close.
8293,Let's fuck the economy and never get a grip on the virus..
8294,"Because even if you are vaccinated when you do contract the virus, there is a period of time between that infection and when your immunity system wins against the virus and you are effectively contagious, and you may never know when you catch it."
8295,A lot of the mask mandates will likely stay in place as a result until enough of the population has been vaccinated and the virus isn’t able to spread as easily.
8296,There's definitely pros and cons to this.
8297,You may think that the company is greedy and are only doing this for their employees (bottom line).
8298,Which is true but they are potentially helping the system as well.
8299,If they have the freezer they are probably going to give the vaccine to their employees free of charge.
8300,We all know how expensive the American healthcare system can be.
8301,Also it makes it more convenient for the employees to get the vaccine.
8302,They don't have to book an appointment and take a day off to get the vaccine.
8303,The con to this is obvious is that hospitals might not have enough freezers due to limited supply.
8304,Restaurants or people.
8305,And I’m truly sorry to all the restaurant owners and workers impacted.
8306,This sucks but it sucks less
8307,Long term care worker in Arkansas.
8308,All facilities here are locked down the same way.
8309,We've been wearing masks at all times for months.
8310,"Constant staff meetings to remind us to wear our masks up, wash and sanitize hands all the time, how to don PPE, etc."
8311,"Rules are changed and added frequently, too."
8312,We did really well for months.
8313,Only a couple of resident positives and a handful of staff positives.
8314,"Weekly testing of everyone, with rapid testing available for anyone that fails the screening (temp and symptom check at the front door) or residents with symptoms."
8315,"About a month ago, that rapidly changed."
8316,Night and weekend staff weren't following proper procedures.
8317,"Weren't wearing masks properly, eating at the nurses' desks, etc."
8318,1 or 2 positives each week became 5-10 positives.
8319,"We started testing more frequently, and still weren't getting ahead of cases."
8320,"Now about a third of our residents are positive, deaths are spiking, and we struggle with staff shortages because there's so many staff positives."
8321,We've also gone from being HEROES in April to being treated quite poorly.
8322,State funded hazard pay ended in June.
8323,We're blamed by the higher ups for what is frankly an unavoidable situation given the circumstances.
8324,"Stressed from being overworked, under pressure not to fuck up in the smallest of ways (like adjusting your mask without washing your hands after), worried we'll take Covid home to our loved ones, worried we'll infect our residents and coworkers."
8325,Leadership is piss poor and toxic.
8326,I've started looking for jobs outside the healthcare industry.
8327,"This proves that Bloomberg is a biased, unreliable news source."
8328,Ford tends to be more than a corporation in Michigan.
8329,Both Ford and GM have significant investment in the state's wellbeing and tend to be decent corporate citizens.
8330,"While I'm sure Ford will be sure to vaccinate their staff and suppliers first - that's a significant percentage of the population near their facilities and it wouldn't surprise me to see them use their facilities for drive thru vaccination in places like Dearborn (Detroit), Flint, Lansing, etc."
8331,"In fact, I somewhat expect that."
8332,What do people think about getting thousands of nurses from china to help in US hospitals?
8333,"Oleander, toxic as fuck yep"
8334,So they did exorcism
8335,no.
8336,people should make decisions about whether or not to pause their degrees.
8337,many people just want to finish it and start their careers.
8338,there is no public health risk with online schooling so it’s a personal decision
8339,I don’t quite understand what the hullabaloo is.
8340,"My previous work has always paid for my innoculations I require for work (Hep B booster, travel vaccinations, flu shot)."
8341,"It’s like, a bonus part of working with them."
8342,They also said they’d cover stuff like quarantine times (but never needed to until technically this year way after I worked for them lol).
8343,"A lot of the vaccination take up will be driven by business needs, as sucky as that sounds."
8344,"Universities will require them, health care and aged care, also child care workers too."
8345,There’s heaps of precedence for this
8346,We are ohhhhh soooooo close.
8347,SO CLOSE.
8348,I couldn't imagine the grief if I passed the virus to someone I knew closely due to being so blasé.
8349,That would be a terrible thing to have to live with.
8350,&gt; How can you know something is fake without knowing what it is?
8351,"If you really wanted to push that argument, you could even say that *if he knew what they were claiming the cure was, he still wouldn't be able to say that it's fake*."
8352,"If it was revealed to be hydroxychloroquine, or colloidal silver, or bleach, or whatever, it's not like he could confidently say ""yeah, I know that doesn't cure covid"", as if he's a medical researcher who has exhaustively studied that exact thing with a bunch of covid-positive patients."
8353,"On the flip-side, if I sent you spam about a get-rich-quick scheme but didn't tell you what it is, would you think that I'm full of BS even without knowing what my get-rich-quick scheme was?"
8354,"I think you could still be pretty confident that I was full of it, even if you didn't know what I was selling."
8355,"&gt;student debt forgiveness is fair

Student debt forgiveness is incredibly unfair, and I say this as someone who would greatly benefit."
8356,It's a shame that the small businesses haven't been provided sufficient help by the government.
8357,I mean we all know the big corporations will come out fine with only a small hit but it's the local small businesses that are the ones truly struggling where some won't even make it
8358,Wouldn't be amazing if Trump could get all his voters and move to a different planet where you could be as stupid as you can without affecting normal people's lives?
8359,"I truly believe people who don't wear masks think they have exceptional genes and won't be one of the people who needs the hospital, therefore I don't think it would persuade them."
8360,Although I wish there was something that could be done to show preferential treatment to the victims instead of the perps.
8361,"“Freedom,” though."
8362,Lots and lots of “freedom” sloshing around.
8363,"And with no masks, nothing stops anyone from gathering up all that “freedom” and alarming it all over their faces, and putting some in their wallets."
8364,So.
8365,Much.
8366,Freedom.
8367,per dose.

8369,Dumb excuses.
8370,The federal government was warned in January.
8371,Trump is on tape admitting it and the fact that he downplayed the threat.
8372,"So, the administration pretended it was under control while they botched testing, and failed the pick up spread."
8373,That's why nobody knew they had to do anything until March.
8374,Everyone was intentionally misled.
8375,Stop this revisionist garbage.
8376,We all lived through it.
8377,Isn't plasma another one of those treatments that got emergency authorization like hydroxychloroquine?
8378,"The issue is lockdown raging, not COVID."
8379,"COVID doesn't cause people to get evicted, government policy and consumer confidence do."
8380,I'm not sure.
8381,I miss a lot of the press conferences.
8382,Possible though.
8383,Another example of why the best response has been in countries that relied on standard public health practices rather than hoping for a miracle cure.
8384,Loaded question.
8385,You’re being anti-vax.
8386,The federal government ironically does not even remotely reflect American culture.
8387,"I'm not antivax by any means, but I'm gonna definitely wait a few months to observe the side effects and just keep wearing a mask and distancing in the meantime."
8388,&gt; There’s no full time jobs available man.
8389,I feel your struggle.
8390,I do gig work and sell plasma.

8395,I live in Wisconsin and I can confirm that it is a train wreck.
8396,Our hospitals are packed but I still get crap for wearing a mask and staying home as much as I can... which explains a lot about how it got so bad here.
8397,"It was like pre-covid Black Friday this week at both Target and Hobby Lobby (yes, yarn is an essential purchase for staying at home lol)."
8398,Here you go: [https://archive.is/GXQjU](https://archive.is/GXQjU)
8399,Ford already has a captive audience of tens of thousands of people (their workforce).
8400,It's difficult to imagine a local clinic being able to use the equipment more efficiently.
8401,And they are not trying to corner the market on freezers.
8402,This actually sounds like less than they would ultimately need.
8403,Whole foods continues to have confirmed COVID-19 cases within their employees.
8404,"The last recent COVID-19 confirmed cases are: November 08, November 21, November 24."
8405,They are not counting/regulating the capacity of people who enter the store.
8406,Employees are only receiving a text of confirmed cases and not being notified if they came in contact with the person.
8407,No.
8408,I have a year left on my bachelors in software engineering.
8409,I'm tired of poverty.
8410,I'm ready to graduate and get out there!
8411,I live in rural America and I’m not surprised.

8418,Shut all the dining/drinking establishments down until this is resolved.
8419,The people that don't currently believe in climate change still won't believe it even if it impacts them.
8420,Climate change is too slow and gradual of a process to handle emotionally.
8421,"We can point to all the data proving that their homes were destroyed due to climate change and they'll chalk it up to some freak weather event if it's a disaster, or say that's how things have always been."
8422,If they come around at all they'll say it is climate change but not man-made.
8423,Some people simply cannot be helped...
8424,Wait hasn't canada secured any doses of any of the vaccines?
8425,I would of thought they'd atleast have some doses secured for December/January
8426,With the flag print even.
8427,"""We're only wearing these to get through the airport and onto the plane, these gaiters are coming down the second we're wheels up."""
8428,"Oof, I've been going to the doctor fairly often since the beginning and everyone has been wearing masks, doing screenings, and checking temperatures."
8429,At least Wisconsin has dope medical care.
8430,Ugh this happened to one of my friends!
8431,He graduated this year with a theater degree and is now totally fucked.
8432,I don't think that site is very accurate tbh.
8433,A 50% chance for a 10 person gathering would mean that ~1/20 people from a random population are infected with COVID.
8434,Either a) the statistic is not true and significantly less have it or b) the disease is literally not an issue if 5% of the population can have it or c) the disease sucks at spreading.
8435,Also keep in mind that a confirmed COVID positive individual should not be included in this population (and to be honest most sick people) because they will be isolated.
8436,"I'm sorry, I am a very slow and stupid person, but this does not help me lol."
8437,"I know that soap and water kills COVID on your hands, but I don't want to assume that the same logic holds for a clothes washer."
8438,"FWIW, the article says they’re considering shortening it from 14 days down to 10 days."
8439,The stupidity of some people never fails to amaze me
8440,Or they could just pay their fair share in taxes.

8454,Yh pretty much the pandemic will end.
8455,Once we've got the vaccines and started to roll out to the large majority of the population covid cases will probably decrease drastically to the point where its manageable and not much of a deal.
8456,"Also, everyone is wonderful in one way or another."
8457,"Well, not everyone."
8458,"Simple variety says that not everyone has some of each, so there are a few saints and a few daemons."
8459,No the point is this whole pandemic is a political issue.
8460,Why do you think the police are involved.
8461,A lockdown should only be in the event of a national emergency.
8462,Changing the reason for mortality from the flu to covid is not a valid reason for closing businesses and creating a massive economic depression now is it?
8463,"The media going on as if the government are saving us all, give me a break."
8464,Not to mention the fact that thousands more people will die from cancer because they are not being treated because of this covid nonsense.
8465,Cancer patients have small chance of survival if treated.
8466,"1 in 10,000 healthy people will die from covid, the mass hysteria of this is mind boggling"
8467,My kids got tested for the 3rd time today.
8468,"Can’t go to school with any type of cold, and if they’re home with a cold, they need either a 14 day quarantine or negative test to return."

8470,"There's also the fact that there are 100 million people at risk for age or underlying condition and not a single one of the skeptics is proposing a massive plan to isolate them for months with food, housing, income, etc in any detail."

8476,Same.
8477,I have a retail job right now and I still feel bad that people have it worse than me.
8478,My degree is in theatre so my industry is 100% fucked until people get their shit together and this goes away.
8479,Is anyone surprised by this?
8480,Well yh we probably won't be able to fully end covid19.
8481,We'll probably still get se cases of covid19 every year but if the vaccines work well then I'm sure we'll be able to bring covid19 down to manageable levels where the majority of the population are protected and we can return to normal life.
8482,In other words it'll no longer be a pandemic basically

8488,My brother and I are roommates and my parents want us to come to Thanksgiving.
8489,"Because they have already had it, and my brother and I live together with no one else, there's pretty much 0 potential for spread, right?"
8490,Personally it still feels wrong to go.
8491,Is there something else I might not be considering?
8492,Or is there really 0 risk?

8502,"Most people wont get vaccinated in 2021, that will be in 2022"
8503,What point are you making?
8504,That some of these deaths are young people at nursing homes?
8505,It took awhile to get to the rural areas.
8506,17 have died from Covid at our local nursing home on the UP border and staff continues to test positive due to high levels in the community.
8507,The nursing home has been on lockdown and most of these residents have died alone without family by their side.
8508,"I think it's a combination of conspiratorial thinking, telling people what they want to believe and fits with their pre-existing beliefs (e.g."

8520,Do you believe most anti lockdown people are protesting.
8521,"Your claim was that there was no competition, no testing and no standardization."
8522,I understand premeds are upset about the scope creep of mid-level practitioners but that's the fault of the AMAs stranglehold on the number of residency positions.
8523,"Yep, but that’s not the whole story and I imagine that’s why people downvoted."
8524,Try thinking about it another way: I haven’t tested anyone in North Dakota at all.

8534,I'm reevaluating my skills to figure out a way to make myself more marketable both in and out of the industry.
8535,My best bet right now is probably leveraging the supervisory experience I gained in the Air Force which will hopefully make me at least somewhat attractive as a manager.
8536,Experience with maintenance databases and record keeping might also be valuable to the right employer.
8537,I don't want to settle for a measly retail slave job.

8631,Mortality rate has not increased.
8632,No more people have died in the last 6 months of covid than the same period of last year.

8658,"Well, that's the theory."
8659,"We will see if their case counts start actually dropping or if that's just a remnant of testing issues, Thanksgiving, or other factors."
8660,A little early to tell at this point.
8661,Unfortunately everyone has their own sense of what sucks more.
8662,All these decisions are about trade offs and there are many who have decided it would suck more to miss out on family gatherings than the higher potential risk of infecting or being infected with Covid.

8667,Simple answer:  It will block 95% of relevant particles.
8668,"Even simpler explanation:  If you're wearing an N95 mask, you can't easily breathe in an orange, right?"
8669,"If the object (respiratory droplets / particulate) is large enough, it will be completely prevented from being passed by the material."
8670,5% of relevant particles are *smaller than the mask will filter*.

8675,"And the whole point of the first lockdown was to give those hospitals time to expand their capacity, which they didn't do."
8676,These deaths are from the cases recorded roughly 3 weeks ago also.
8677,So average deaths might be 2500-3000 by mid December.
8678,The crazy thing about math is that at some point everyone in the country will have caught it and there will be no one left to infect.

8728,Your daughter will remember how nothing was more important to her parents than her;  how they fostered her imagination and when tough times come to her throughout her life(as they do to us all) she will have those memories to keep her strong.

8733,Because of people like you 1000s more will die.

8743,What do you mean?
8744,:)
8745,Do you realize how insane this sounds?
8746,I said that 1) I feel an obligation to read about and understand medications before I take them and 2) feel I have the responsibility to educate myself about their risks instead of expecting someone else to do.
8747,I have basically just described being a good medical consumer - the equivalent of reading all the fine print on the materials which accompany a medication RX.
8748,"To cut further to the chase, I wrote ""I wholly support vaccination"" and ""I get them all."""
8749,You're simultaneously being rude and ignorant.
8750,"bout to say ""Slackers"""
8751,Now you can sit in your cabin and wonder “is it sea sickness or Covid nausea?
8752,"Is it Covid diarrhea or typical cruise ship virus diarrhea?” 

Either way, if they’re Americans they’re just going to pop some Imodium and head up to the pool bar."
8753,If only
8754,Do you realize this is happening at the hospitals down the road too?
8755,"I think we will have at least one week of a ""Vietnam"" every day."
8756,After lightning it on fire
8757,No I’m not.
8758,Explain it to me like I’m 5.
8759,Guess they have a problem hosting conspiracy theory fruit-loops.
8760,all these cases will be written off as anxiety/stress most likely.
8761,Why are they older?
8762,We've never stopped having wars and making new veterans
8763,We didn't suffer because we weren't idiots in sufficiently large quantities for it to ever get bad enough.
8764,We didn't have to suffer as much because it never got that far.
8765,I don't have time to go to the beach because of my job.
8766,In a hospital.
8767,Downstairs office sharing a connecting door with the Covid-19 testing lab.
8768,As it has done for most of this year.
8769,Emirates and Qantas code share.
8770,They are very likely going to require it as well.
8771,And unless you hold an Australian passport you will very likely need a prove of vaccination to enter Australia anyway.
8772,Unless you want to quarantine for 2 weeks.
8773,Australia does not fuck around when it comes to this stuff.
8774,They are unlocking too early!
8775,They need to remain in their homes for the next 6 months at the least.
8776,The Senate deserves just as much credit as POTUS.
8777,"POTUS helmed the messaging, but the Senate failed to act."
8778,People are not prepared for what's coming.
8779,"Two things not accounted for:

1."
8780,Seasonality.
8781,"Yes, it has begun, but it scales up by an order of magnitude at least by the end of December."
8782,"Way more cases then people think will occur, and they will be more severe, and you will be able to catch it in situations where you couldn't during the summer."
8783,2.
8784,"Once hospitals are full, they don't become unfull."
8785,They are already almost full everywhere.
8786,"Want to accomplish a 3%, 5% IFR?"
8787,Have zero hospital care available for the millions of cases.
8788,"I guess this is what ""just living our lives without fear"" looks like."
8789,"Nope, not at all."
8790,"As an RN who works with COVID patients, I’ve seen young grads come to my hospital, see how fucked up it is and leave."
8791,"It isn’t like we aren’t educated enough to recognize when we don’t have the require protection, it is up to us to choose to put up with it."
8792,That was my point.
8793,"If this returning RN chose to work, knowing the risks, especially for her age, that was also her choice."
8794,[removed]
8795,It will be extremely frustrating if other states are getting it first because of NYs stricter guidelines.
8796,Thst could be my life or a family members life because of a massive pissing contest between our governor and our current president.
8797,The people who lose.
8798,New Yorkers.
8799,I’d probably try lab grown human meat but not if it means prion disease
8800,"Also can have crowdfunding going, which a lot of the most rancid people do."
8801,Probably because the survival rate is so high.
8802,It’s just not worth the effort or expense.
8803,Precisely.
8804,"Also, my own sibling is immunocompromised so she IS at risk but she’s like “if I get it I get it”."
8805,Make it make sense pleaaaaaase.
8806,Naa... we drink that..
8807,Guess they didn't agree with the narrative.
8808,But if that is true... were are all the empty homes?
8809,More like in the next 2 weeks
8810,And I hope for a new Bugatti by the end of this year
8811,2020 has been like the strongest proof of the failings of American individualism.
8812,The idea of American individualism is that everyone is a rational actor and should be left to their own devices because rational people will make the right choice without the government needing to tell them to do so.
8813,Coronavirus has handily disproved that assumption.
8814,"&gt; Now I see the same people who are perfectly fine to walk through a whole body scanner, surrender their electronics and allow invasive body searches complain that wearing a mask is some horrendous attack on their freedoms."
8815,Even worse is we have evidence masks work where as far as I can tell there have been no terror attacks actually prevented by airport security theatre such as taking your belt and shoes off or only being allowed 100ml of liquid.
8816,"&gt; 
&gt; 
You'd think these people would at least realize *some* of the irony in yelling about their freedoms when being required to wear a mask."
8817,"I'm sure some airport has at least a handful of people per day right now yelling about ""their rights"" while taking their shoes off to walk through a body scanner."
8818,that's where I've gotten all of mine.
8819,"Plus I try and buy from places that obviously make the masks themselves, not ship from overseas."
8820,So I figure I'm helping out a small business owner too
8821,I'm starting to really wonder this.
8822,I'm sure these folks know the risks.
8823,"If I spend all my time sitting alone in a nursing home, am I really going to be afraid of dying after spending good time with my entire family?"
8824,What's the alternative?
8825,A 3-year long slow death in the nursing home?
8826,?
8827,I never really understood the 14 day recommendation vs 10 day.
8828,Vast majority of people who become symptomatic do so within that 10 day time frame.
8829,It’s possible for the virus to take as long as 14 days to incubate but it’s very rare.
8830,And testing should be accurate within the 10 day time frame.
8831,"Relevant at the top of the post :

&gt;  LifeSite’s channel was suspended by YouTube."
8832,Watch our videos here.
8833,Are you kidding?
8834,Cui bono?
8835,Can you imagine if Trump had won and all his supporters would've packed the streets celebrating?
8836,People would've lost their shit.
8837,I work a full time job as a teacher putting in effort.
8838,I do this to get paid so I can buy things i need and I enjoy for me and family.
8839,If that is no longer an option than I wouldnt put any effort into my job at all.
8840,If you're youngish and healthyish then odds are good you'll be fine.
8841,"Just to be safe though, if you dont already have a pulse ox or something else to monitor oxygen levels with at home then get one asap."
8842,My MIL was discharged from the hospital (with the virus) because all her vitals were perfectly normal and her symptoms had improved significantly after staying there for one night.
8843,"Two days later she checked her oxygen out of habit before going to sleep and got a reading of 84 (near organ failure level), despite feeling completely fine."
8844,"She went back to the hospital and was there for three days before being discharged again, but this time with oxygen tanks she had to stay hooked up to for 2 weeks."
8845,She was told that if she had gone to sleep that night she would not have woken up.
8846,"That's why they broke it down for several counties, using the rates for them."
8847,"I think it's bad math for the reason that people tend to stay home when they don't feel well, so the absolute number of cases in a county is going to be the most upper bound."
8848,Thank you.
8849,"As my husband would say ""there's worse things at sea"""
8850,"It should be fine, try having another opening to get a cross current going"
8851,Unbelievable.
8852,Literally unbelievable.
8853,"You're not ""saving"" Christmas, you're ensuring that a group of people won't see next Christmas."
8854,A stay at home Thanks Giving is better than an ICU Christmas.
8855,This pandemic is being fuled by people thinking that only strangers have COVID.
8856,They wear the masks in the stores but then go to friends houses and take them off.
8857,Chicks can be dudes too dude.
8858,"Exercise made my pain worse, sadly."
8859,I was in the army when i took it.
8860,I had to lay down everytime i got home because I was in so much pain.
8861,"Changed medication, made the pain manageable."
8862,I wouldn't hold my breathe.
8863,I mean what hasn't been an embarrassment?
8864,It'll happen.
8865,But not in mid December.
8866,"Remember, trust on the US to do the right thing... After its screwed up and tried everything else."
8867,What?
8868,"I wonder if this leads to better care and benifits for the surviving VA, kind of playing russian roulette."
8869,"Or if they keep having to miss work every time they are exposed, they won't make you any money."
8870,"Even if the vaccine simply reduces severity, the companies win by not having to cover extended ICU care with their healthplans."
8871,"It's a no-brainer, in my opinion, for large companies to buy cold storage and vaccinate all their employees."
8872,This ban is so ridiculous.
8873,Restaurants here are responsible for around 3% of covid cases here in LA.
8874,"At the same time, there's no plan to bail out the industry or it's employees(like me)."
8875,Newsom just expects everyone to tough out.
8876,A few months ago Newsom paid a Chinese company $1 billion to make covid masks.
8877,The company had never made masks before.
8878,Not one mask has been delivered yet.
8879,"That billion dollars could have gone a long way to keep some people afloat, but here we are."
8880,2100 deaths today.
8881,Wake up people and stay home...this is heartbreaking.
8882,"Interesting, I didn't know that, thank you for the information."
8883,There are people I know personally who are relieved they don't have to bother with unpleasant extended family this year.
8884,Depends on when in the process they get inoculated and the state of community spread at the time.
8885,RIP BNO.
8886,The mods massacred them lmfao.
8887,"I mean it doesn't really work that way, but it will be really bad regardless."
8888,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  ""No one gets rich, but no one dies. """
8889,"lol that's true, too bad only the FAA or the President can shut down air travel."
8890,"Unfortunately, the outgoing one is too busy on the golf course &amp; the incoming one doesn't get sworn in until Jan."
8891,You have no idea how much it pains me.
8892,One couple I know was literally cheating on each other and about to break up for good and now they have a baby on the way

8895,"From the ctv article:

8898,"From her obituary: 

""This occasion was made into a happy one thanks to the compassionate and excellent delivery of Medical Assistance in Dying."

8901,"[...]
She left this world disappointed in Canada profiting from selling weapons to Saudi Arabia and angry with Ottawa's hypocrisies toward the Indigenous peoples and nations of Turtle Island."
8902,"To celebrate life generally and Nancy's interests particularly, Nancy encourages all to reflect and act to balance and repair the destructive impacts of extractive industries on water and the life it sustains by supporting practices of Indigenous Sovereignty."""
8903,Her obituary requests that mourners donate to Indigenous charities and movements.
8904,Well as long as you're ok with it.
8905,I work in stocks and you just described the stock market haha.

9033,I've heard story after story about entire families getting infected after doing this self-absorbed garbage.
9034,Whatever....all I can say is that I feel really fortunate for the family I have.
9035,Good luck with that.
9036,Is the mentality of Americans about risk reward?
9037,As in it is not worth the effort of curtailing the way of life for 90% of the people for the 1% who would die and the other 9% who might have long term issues.
9038,"I have a feeling that if the mortality rate is 20%, maybe more Americans would pay attention."
9039,Is there really a way to convince them otherwise when vaccines are on the way.
9040,Were they being responsible prior to the holidays?
9041,"What I’m saying is people who are doing things like obeying distancing, wearing masks, etc."
9042,"probably won’t suddenly stop doing that until _they_ get a vaccine themselves, not a small portion of other people."
9043,"Though, I’m sure there’s outliers."

9059,This is what it's like when less than 1% of the population has been infected.
9060,How do you think it would be if we let it reach 8%?
9061,No like that’s different lol.
9062,You can easily verify how trump is racist.
9063,It doesn’t require expert knowledge to understand.
9064,When you say travel up to 2019 levels except for third world countries what do you mean by that?
9065,If anything I think a lot of third world countries are really aching to get foreigners back in - tourism is one of the biggest industries in countries like Vietnam and Cambodia and they probably lost a hell of a lot of jobs because of it.

9077,It's tagged as good news and your comment is well upvoted.
9078,"Translation of :

What is the cause of Hailian Cold Storage (epidemic)?"
9079,"On November 17, we received a notification from Dezhou City, Shandong Province that they received a batch of imported German pork knuckles transferred from Tianjin Port to Dezhou City, and the outer packaging was positive for nucleic acid."
9080,"Following this line, we conducted a full investigation of the Hailian Cold Storage, and the investigation found Case 138 and Case 139."
9081,Both cases occurred in Hailian cold storage.
9082,"Conceptually, everyone thinks that the frozen product was passed on to them, but there are some details."
9083,"&amp;#x200B;

The source of his infection in case 139, who transmitted it to him?"
9084,"Through our epidemiological investigation, we found that the things that two people came into contact with were different."
9085,Case 138 was an unloading worker.
9086,The goods he unloaded were pork knuckles that tested positive in Texas.
9087,Case 139 was a driver.
9088,"The goods he transported were North American pig heads, but he had never transported German pork knuckles."
9089,"&amp;#x200B;

At that time, we thought, why one was exposed to pork knuckle and the other was exposed to pig heads."
9090,There was no crossover between them.
9091,Why was case 139 infected?
9092,Can we check to see if the pig's head is contaminated?
9093,"Unfortunately, since all the pig heads have been sent out, there is no stock in Hailian Cold Storage, so we have no way to conduct further inspections on the pig heads."
9094,"&amp;#x200B;

Who passed the ""thing"" to Case 139?"
9095,Is a doubt.
9096,"Was it case 138, they had contact, and then case 138 passed to 139?"
9097,"The current tune shows that the two of them don't know each other and have no contact at all, and the people are another suspect."
9098,"&amp;#x200B;

The pig's head and pork knuckle are all placed in the same warehouse."
9099,The pig's knuckle contaminates the pig's head.
9100,Is the driver who transports the pig's head infected?
9101,The information provided to us by Liu Tiao is like this: pork knuckles are stored in cold storage No.
9102,"4, and pig heads are transported away from the door of cold storage No."
9103,"6, which means that the two of them have no intersection."
9104,One is related to cold storage No.
9105,4.
9106,One is related to cold storage No.
9107,"6, which is completely different."
9108,"&amp;#x200B;

Deciphering the source of infection of case 139 requires an in-depth epidemiological investigation."
9109,"In this epidemiological investigation, we collected videos from the cold storage and then looked for suspicious points."
9110,We sorted out the main reason for the infection of case 139 .
9111,November 4th was the storage day of Hailian Cold Storage.
9112,Three batches of goods were shipped to Hailian Cold Storage at different times that day.
9113,"First of all, please take a look at this picture."
9114,"The green marks are 6 cold storages, and the light-colored underneath is the work table of the cold storage, which is a buffer zone."
9115,This part is at room temperature.
9116,"On November 4, three shipments arrived at Hailian Cold Storage."
9117,They were German pork knuckles.
9118,They were shipped in from Warehouse No.
9119,4.
9120,There were also two batches of pig heads.
9121,The two batches of pig heads were shipped in morning and afternoon.
9122,One batch of pig heads arrived.
9123,No.
9124,"2 library, and a batch of working platforms that passed the No."
9125,4 library are placed in the No.
9126,"5 library, which is next to the No."
9127,4 library.
9128,Pork knuckle and pig head share a working platform.
9129,"&amp;#x200B;

The key person to be mentioned here is the stevedore."
9130,In case No.
9131,"138, he moved the pork knuckles into the warehouse."
9132,"At the same time, he also handled the pig heads that entered the warehouse 2, but the pig head stevedores in the warehouse 5 did not."
9133,Carry out unloading.
9134,"&amp;#x200B;

November 5 is the day of delivery."
9135,The German pork knuckle came out of the work platform of the No.
9136,4 warehouse.
9137,The unloading worker is still the No.
9138,138 case.
9139,The key point here is that after he has moved the pig heads in the No.
9140,"2 warehouse, the next day will be the same."
9141,"Wearing the same clothes, wearing the same gloves, without disinfection, continue to leave the pig elbow."
9142,"It is possible that, in Dezhou, Shandong, the positive test of the outer packaging of pork knuckle was caused by the contamination of the clothes or gloves of the workers."
9143,"&amp;#x200B;

There was also a batch of pig heads out of the warehouse that day."
9144,"The two out of the warehouse overlapped more than an hour, but Case 138 did not participate in the out of the pig heads, and the out of the warehouse was from Gate 6."
9145,The pig's head is stored in warehouse No.
9146,5 and came out of warehouse No.
9147,6.
9148,What I want to mention here is the truck driver.
9149,The truck driver does not participate in the handling of pigs during the entire transportation process.
9150,How did he get infected?
9151,We then checked the video and found a big breakthrough.
9152,"During the process of leaving the pig's head, the outer packaging of the pig's head fell apart, and the pig's head with a layer of plastic film rolled to the ground."
9153,The driver participated in picking up the pig's head.
9154,He picked up the pig's head and put it away.
9155,"Go back to the car, so he was exposed to a pig's head."
9156,"This can also explain the source of his infection in 139 cases, indeed pig heads."
9157,"&amp;#x200B;

In this incident, the source of infection we identified should be North American pig heads, which contaminated German pork knuckle and caused the positive of the German pork knuckle packaging."
9158,There are other evidences.
9159,"We collected specimens where pig heads were scattered, and the nucleic acid test was positive, and the sequencing at the same time was exactly the same as the gene sequencing of 139 cases."
9160,"&amp;#x200B;

From this, what we can confirm in this epidemic is that North American pig heads were the source of its infection, causing No."
9161,"138 to participate in the removal of pig heads (infection), and then driver No."
9162,"139 who participated in the picking of pig heads (infection), all of which were exposed to pig heads."
9163,"&amp;#x200B;

We were still at the porter’s resting place, and the three-bed sheets tested positive for the new coronavirus nucleic acid."
9164,This is the situation and source of infection of the entire epidemic situation in Hailian Cold Storage.
9165,This can basically be confirmed and closed.
9166,Should be some fascinating conversation
9167,Hope with Moderna and AstraZeneca joining also we will have a big supply going into Feb/March.
9168,But yet they follow the science deniers.
9169,Not sure if people are downvoting you because they think you’re racist or what... but you probably could have used context.
9170,"Skin with a higher melanin density inhibits production of vitamin D, which has shown to possibly be a cofactor in recovery and effects of the disease."
9171,This could be a contributor to why COVID mortality rates have been higher in ethnic groups with higher melanin content.
9172,"Couple that with a job that is done entirely indoors, it would make logical sense that those predisposed to decreased vitamin D production that spend a lot of time indoors, would possibly be at higher risk."
9173,Ethnic differences are IMPORTANT in medicine.

9191,"We mostly only need new restrictions and lockdowns because people won't follow masks, distancing, etc though."
9192,"With 100% mask compliance, social distancing, hygiene measures, and decent testing + tracing infrastructure, lockdowns wouldn't be needed except the initial before we had any real info on this virus."
9193,Some activities would be inherently too dangerous but lockdowns aren't really needed unless you let the virus run rampant.

9224,Look up the number of vaccines that have effects that aren't expressed within the first few months.
9225,Then remember that the FDA made these companies wait for two months after the second shot to submit for an EUA.
9226,"I understand- and I'm not being sarcastic- that for many of us vaccines are just kinda magic, as much as wifi or even electricity is."
9227,I get that.
9228,But the idea that you're injected with something and ten years down the road you die from your heart exploding simply doesn't correspond to modern medical science.

What actually happened was Canada was going to work with China on running Phase 3 trials, just like Brazil, Indonesia, etc because China has too few domestic cases to test on."
9252,"The ""payment"" for the trial is Canada gets priority shipment of Chinese vaccines and license to produce it if they want."
9253,"Then someone in Canada or the US realized the company they're working with is linked to the Chinese military, oh nos, butt hurt commence, and Canada pulled out of P3 before it even started."

9267,"It's reasonable to pin at at about 5, since there are other factors:

* Upwards of 40% of COVID cases are completely asymptomatic from end-to-end, and so those people would have no reason to even get tested and be part of the case count at any point;
* 80% of symptomatic cases have *mild* symptoms, and could feel well enough to be out doing social events; and
* *All* cases have period of time during which they're non-symptomatic but contagious which, on average, is a little longer than how long they're symptomatic."

9328,Germany has more labour regulations than Canada and it's likely that UK pre brexit  also had similar regulations.

9356,Most hit their peak cases last week or two weeks ago.
9357,How can something growing exponentially hit peaks?
9358,Nothing grows exponentially for too long before behavior forces a change.
9359,Other places are booming right now just like the Midwest was last month and will grow and then themselves peak in a few weeks.
9360,And on and on until the vaccine
9361,Do you have a source for the spread only being 3%?
9362,"&gt; Japan is scaling back a contentious subsidy program designed to  encourage domestic tourism and dining out, after it became clear the  enticements were helping to fuel a third wave that has resulted in  record new infections."
9363,"Having been invited to dine at restaurants and go drinking after work numerous times even right after news of the cases escalating (which I turn down every time), I cannot help but feel jaded and that the typical population here is apathetic or just going the old cultural ""can't be helped"" mindset."

9366,"Yep, White Oleander is a crazy book, and one of the characters uses it to kill."
9367,It was made in to a film with Michelle Pfeiffer.
9368,Letting the virus spread rapidly in order to speed up the trials can kinda be compared to tanking.
9369,"&gt; “We just need you, the American people, to hold on a little bit longer,” Adams, a White House coronavirus task force member, told Fox News in an interview."
9370,You lead by example and when the Whitehouse is obviously not taking this seriously and still holding their Thanksgiving and Christmas celebrations its hard to get the citizens to do otherwise.
9371,"Simply need to read the article not just the headline ;)

&gt;Global shipping giant UPS on Tuesday said it would start making dry ice in the United States and also distribute ultra-cold temperature freezers as it prepares to handle the logistics of shipping Covid-19 vaccines."
9372,"&gt;In a statement, UPS said it had added equipment in its facilities that can produce up to 1,200 pounds of dry ice an hour for the shipping needs of these vaccines, which can be distributed within 24 hours of production to US and Canadian hospitals."
9373,"&gt;UPS also announced a partnership with freezer manufacturer Stirling Ultracold to distribute freezers capable of reaching temperatures as low as -80 degrees Celsius to doctors' offices, pharmacies and urgent care facilities where the vaccines may be stored for long periods of time."
9374,&gt;UPS stock was 3.7 percent higher at the close.

9395,95% effectiveness essentially means that with everyone vaccinated the spread of this thing really can be 100% stopped with a two week shutdown.
9396,"We have tons of terror attacks, but when it's white people shooting up schools or invading government buildings or whatever, we don't use the T word."
9397,The reason we seem to have less Islamic extremist terror attacks by POC is because Europe is connected by land and a relatively crossable sea.
9398,Same reason there are a lot more Mexican immigrants in the US than in Europe.
9399,I bought hundreds of 3M N95 masks in February and March.
9400,"Some I brought back to the stores (Lowes, Home Dept and Tru Value Hardware) in May."

9418,Stop saying “look at the data” and actually give me evidence of your argument.
9419,Yea it does a lot of good to test us all to further overload the labs that are already taking 10-12 days to get us results so by the time we get them back it didn’t matter anyway.

9435,The biggest reason facemasks are not the panacea this article claims they are is not that people don't wear them in public.
9436,"It's that they don't, and won't, wear them in private."
9437,"In my city, mask adherence is basically 100%."

9469,Covid is different in that Gov.

9479,People felt a sense of duty and entitlement because they were being paid to stay home.
9480,The United States government abandoned its people and used this virus as an opportunity to not only accumulate more wealth and gatekeep.

9706,True.
9707,I am a healthcare worker and I’m so lucky to be one of the first thousands will be vaccinated in the U.S.
9708,I hope people don’t have difficulty getting the vaccine when it becomes available to the wider public.
9709,So you've just decided to use your own uninformed opinion as truth despite all evidence to the contrary?
9710,Okay then.
9711,"Inrange, but I'm sure there are other channels that actively demonetize to not bother with it."

10554,"Especially as Sweden has never really a good argument for their claims

* Sweden did enact restrictions and recommendations during spring which brought the spread down, it was never let to run wild
* Seasonality helped keep it down during summer, a second wave during fall was always expected (although not this serious of a second wave)
* Swedish strategy relies a lot on the social security net: Paid sick leave, unemployment benefits, being paid to stay home with sick kids, strong unions and labor laws protecting people from being arbitrarily fired etc."

10825,So everyone can confidently say today we will start rolling out vaccines within 17 days.
10826,"But if they don't take those 17 days now, then in 3 years, or 15 years, the pandemic is dire, the pharmaceutical companies then have data that says we're 99% sure, if we cut the corner on this one test, the FDA didn't check in 2020, they won't now, we can roll it out to health care workers and validate it later."

""Would get a vaccine"" is not the same as ""willing to go out of their way to get one ASAP"" especially if there's two doses."
10840,But believe everyone will go get vaccinated if you want
10841,Does this have anything to do with the riots in kenosha?
10842,"Trump rallies are superspreader events, but riots everyone looks the other way"
10843,I'm thinking more like 4/4/21; I heard it will be over by Easter ;)
10844,Same thought I had reading his letter.
10845,"If my boss came out basically saying he didn't give a sit about my health or workload, I'd have probably quit."
10846,"To be fair, most C suite don't, but they're generally at least smart enough not to advertise it, or encourage others to do the same."
10847,And stay in jail unless if their next stop is prison.
10848,Then stay in prison.
10849,When and where has this been happening?
10850,I mean the last story I heard about any religious violence was the beheading in France.
10851,And they are far from alone.
10852,lmao and wanting to wear a mask is somehow mental illness?
10853,Are you that scarred by mask wearing?
10854,Are you that afraid of people wearing masks?
10855,"Says more about you than anyone else, honestly."
10856,Back to ICQ?
10857,I remember chiseling my messages to my friends on stone tablets on it...
10858,The government is probably tired of dealing with their citizens being idiots.
10859,You are assuming that the gun was  registered?
10860,I can pretty much say fuck everything about this post.
10861,Watch the fed data to see the 1% gain and everybody else lose.
10862,"[https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/dataviz/dfa/distribute/chart/#quarter:123;series:Net%20worth;demographic:networth;population:1,3,5,7;units:levels](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/dataviz/dfa/distribute/chart/#quarter:123;series:Net%20worth;demographic:networth;population:1,3,5,7;units:levels)"
10863,Very excited to see this happen and very excited to not have to be one of the first guinea pigs.
10864,I hope it works well and we can see the results of the first people to get it soon.
10865,I think you’re just completely missing the point of the article.
10866,"The article isn’t arguing or stating anywhere that science has room to be accepted or denied based on belief, but that, if born on sound methodology, is true regardless of understanding or agreement."
10867,And that people have this irrational denial of science and fact because of a lack of understanding and tend to reach to information (i.e.
10868,conspiracies) that is easier to understand and that confirms their bias.
10869,It goes on to compare this irrational denial of fact from conspiracy theorists to similar irrational denial of fact from people who have specific neuropsychological dysfunctions.
10870,It’s basically saying that the low science literacy level and “fear” of complex COVID information is driving conspiracy theories in the US.
10871,Nowhere does it say science should be subjectively accepted or denied.
10872,So I’m confused how it doesn’t make sense?
10873,Your are an antivaxxer /s
10874,"Yeah, bet you Ford will find a way."
10875,He's anti-mask.
10876,'nuf said.
10877,Because there's no other greater vaccination effort to date other than Polio.
10878,Maybe MMR a close second
10879,Fedex misses a lot.
10880,\^Garbage.
10881,"I hate how reddit is literally ""turn off your brain"" now."
10882,&gt; Some of us trust that our medical institutions are intelligent enough to examine studies and make knowledgeable recommendations on what works and doesn't.
10883,That doesn't feel naive at all?
10884,I can remember when the food pyramid was the ideal diet.
10885,I thought it was suitably punny :D.
10886,Some people are actual garbage.
10887,Every dollar they have to squeeze out of another rich asshole is a dollar well conserved for someone else making videos of popsicle stick architecture.
10888,We’re a third world country disguised as a first world super power.
10889,"Yeah, I should have specified but I got lazy - we were talking about antibiotics and why they generally can't be used on viral infections"
10890,And now they know where your wallet is.
10891,"Completely serious, btw."
10892,Lots of pickpockets will watch people check for their wallet.
10893,"Then the mark lets their guard down, and bam, free lunch money."
10894,&gt;Restaurants here are responsible for around 3% of covid cases here in LA.
10895,"10-15% of cases, actually."
10896,"https://la.eater.com/2020/10/29/21536567/morning-briefing-restaurant-news-los-angeles-dr-ferrer-coronavirus-cases-10-percent-dining-out

&gt;County public health director Dr. Barbara Ferrer said in a press conference yesterday that LA County has “seen somewhere between 10 and 15 percent of cases being connected to a dining experience.” She added:

&gt;This makes sense, because when people go to restaurants and bars they often spend a prolonged period of time in the presence of others who are outside of their household without their face coverings, and often engaged in conversations."
10897,Those are all strategies for increasing the spread of COVID-19.
10898,[removed]
10899,"Keep in mind, it doesn't really matter who deserves it."
10900,"What matters is how we can distribute it such that it limits transmission, hospitalization, and death as much as possible."
10901,"That being said, giving it to healthcare workers still makes sense."
10902,I'm so worried about my parents and other elderly relatives and family friends.
10903,"Hell, I'm worried about myself."
10904,It literally keeps me awake at night.
10905,Despite living in the NYC metro area I don't know anyone that's died or even gotten really sick.
10906,A few friends have lost grandparents or other elderly relatives though.
10907,I know it's just a matter of time at this point before I lose someone I know and love to COVID.
10908,I get that people are desperate to resume life as we knew it before March 2020 but we just gotta hang on a little bit longer.
10909,I’d like to think it wasn’t always this way.
10910,"Though I wasn’t born at the time, during WW2 the whole country worked together for the common good."
10911,At least that’s the impression I got in history class.
10912,I don’t know how or when it changed and I don’t think we’ll get back to that for another generation at least.
10913,People like you need to stfu
10914,"If the woman started the fight,  I would  let  her take the ass-whoopin'."
10915,A teen in the family probably.
10916,"Also, it's not like the freezers are spent once every worker is vaccinated."
10917,They will probably sell or loan the freezers to some other organization or even the Health System
10918,[removed]
10919,I keep saying it and I’ll keep on saying it.
10920,Get a flu shot.
10921,"If you are healthy enough to get one, of course."
10922,People will be tested in hospital or post mortem.
10923,[removed]
10924,"Right, and somewhere down the line people lost the meaning of AT LEAST six feet."
10925,If you truly wanted to be safe ten feet or more would have been better.
10926,"It's not always possible because we simply don't have the physical space in most places but people treat it like they can edge in around six feet, which eventually becomes less the more you talk and interact with someone because people tend to not realize what they're doing with their feet while they talk to others."
10927,Or in my case where I'm hard of hearing so when I ask people to repeat themselves they step closer instead of speaking up.
10928,"I'll apologize when you apologize for calling me a ""triggered coping American."""
10929,Keep in mind that the United States had always led the world effort against developing pandemics
10930,Why use an example that too outdated to be relevant?

10934,Herd mentality
10935,Not in the slightest.
10936,Scent molecules are much smaller than virus's.
10937,Also the masks help contain the droplets that carry the virus.
10938,"Viruses come in different sizes, but the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 [has been measured at 60 to 140 nanometers](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7224694/), or between 14,900% and 34,900% larger than a small, stinky molecule like methanthiol."

10952,Mental shit game to cheat the people brains and give them some hope.
10953,I think the UAW would have something to say about that.
10954,"There aren't many unions left in the United States that still have teeth, but that's one of them."
10955,"Yeah that's how traditional vaccines work mRNA are probably safe and I'll take it, but they have never been done before and used on a mass scale."

10967,How convenient!
10968,"So when the real world doesn't happen like they imagine it to be, they get frustrated."
10969,People are acting dumb about this because they have no concept of how ultra cold things are shipped and stored.
10970,Your local university probably has 5-10 -80 freezers in the science department.
10971,And respectable state college probably has hundreds.
10972,Science deals with movement and storage of compounds like this on a daily basis.
10973,People are acting like East nowhere West Virginia won’t be able to figure this out unless they buy a freezer.
10974,That’s not what’s going to happen.
10975,They’re going to set up distribution hubs where the vaccine is stored.
10976,Then they’ll set up vaccine times that have to be scheduled.
10977,All of East nowhere’s 100 residents all need to come to the clinic on Tuesday.
10978,Then the central hub pulls the vaccines from their freezer and ships 100 vaccines on dry ice to the administration point.

11014,Good thinking.
11015,Contact tracing studies imply that home and social gathers seem to be the main drivers.
11016,From the US: The Los Angeles County Health Department was able to trace only 65 to 70% of all positive cases.
11017,"Of those, the majority, 55%, are from gathering/events."
11018,The Health Department didn't specify events' settings ( indoor / outdoor).
11019,"In second place, 17%, places of worship."
11020,"Then 6% childcare, (LA never opened indoor dining, so restaurants spread was not represented here, and their schools were mostly online) and 15% unspecified."

11027,China use more aggressive contact tracing so not sure if the data is self reported it not.
11028,And what is open/closed in the region matters a lot.
11029,It did.

11073,There has been stockpiling of the vaccines in the hope that they work and then can be immediately sent out.

11151,"&gt;Coronavirus outbreaks in the United States were once traced back to their origins, whether at busy restaurants or crowded meatpacking plants."
11152,"But now that the virus is spreading rapidly in much of the country — more than 2,200 U.S. deaths from Covid-19 were reported on Tuesday alone, making it the deadliest day in more than six months — state and local health officials are giving up on contact tracing."
11153,&gt;Revealing the trail of transmission from one person to another is a key tool for containing the spread of the coronavirus.
11154,"Within 48 hours of testing positive, patients receive a phone call from a trained contact tracer, who conducts a detailed interview before hunting down each new person who may have been exposed."
11155,"&gt;That, at least, is how it’s supposed to work."
11156,"&gt;Now, with the United States recording a staggering two million new cases in less two weeks and 42 states recording sustained caseload increases, overwhelmed public health agencies are making hard choices about how much they can still realistically learn, while acknowledging that contact tracing can no longer be expected to contain the virus’s spread."
11157,"&gt;On Monday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released new guidance that called on health departments to focus contact tracing efforts on people who had tested positive within the past six days and especially those who were at the greatest risk of infecting others."
11158,Patients infected more than 14 days ago should not be traced.
11159,"&gt;States like Pennsylvania, which had already been revising its tracing protocols, have announced that they will follow the C.D.C.’s new guidance."
11160,"&gt;Dr. Nirav Shah, who heads Maine’s coronavirus response, explained how his state would scale back its ambitions: Contact tracers would touch base with each new patient only once, and not through the course of their illness, to make sure they were well and quarantining."
11161,"&gt;”Unfortunately, going forward, we have had to make a difficult decision, and I wanted you to hear about that difficult decision from me,” he said when announcing the change."
11162,"&gt;”Sadly, in Maine and throughout the country, the virus is moving faster and spreading faster than the ability of states to train and deploy new public health investigators.”

&gt;Similar decisions were being made all over the country."
11163,&gt;New Hampshire last week said that it would only trace cases of people connected to outbreaks or in specific at-risk age or racial groups.
11164,"&gt;Minnesota’s Itasca County this month said that it was abandoning contact tracing, advising the public that, “if you are in a group setting, just assume that someone has Covid.”

&gt;In North Dakota, state officials said last month that they could no longer have one-on-one conversations with everyone who may have been exposed."
11165,"Aside from situations involving schools and health care facilities, people who test positive were advised to notify their own contacts, leaving residents largely on their own to follow the trail of the outbreak."
11166,&gt;Public health experts remain hopeful that contact tracing remains useful in identifying clusters and determining the broad contours of how and where infections are spreading.
11167,"&gt;”There are diminishing returns when the outbreak is out of control, like it is currently, but the returns aren’t zero,” said Dr. Thomas Tsai, a health policy researcher at Harvard T.H."

11169,"“The discourse around our treatments tends to be all or nothing.”

&gt;Contact tracing capacity in the United States has been weak since the pandemic began, so it is no surprise that it can’t keep up now, said Rich DiPentima, New Hampshire’s former chief of communicable disease and epidemiology."

**It's hard to detect COVID-19 in children**

Infections with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in children are generally [much more mild](https://journals.lww.com/pidj/FullText/2020/06000/COVID_19_in_Children,_Pregnancy_and_Neonates__A.1.aspx) than in adults and easy to overlook."
11230,"A study from South Korea found the majority of children had symptoms mild enough to go unrecognized, and [only 9% were diagnosed at the time of symptom onset](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2770150)."
11231,"Researchers used an antibody test (which can detect if a person had the virus previously and recovered) to screen a representative sample of nearly 12,000 children from the general population in Germany."
11232,They found the [majority of cases in children had been missed](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666634020300209).
11233,"In itself, that's not surprising, because many cases in adults are missed, too."
11234,"But what made this study important, was that it showed young and older children were similarly likely to have been infected."
11235,"Official testing in Germany had suggested young children were much less likely to be infected than teenagers, but this wasn't true."
11236,Younger children with infections just weren't getting tested.
11237,The study also found nearly half of infected children were asymptomatic.
11238,This is about [twice what's typically seen in adults](https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa955/5869860).
11239,"In the case of IQ, which is what the comment was most likely referring to, mean, median, and mode are the same (100)."

&gt;In the COVID-19 pandemic, 57 million people have already been infected worldwide."
11272,"In the search for vaccines and therapies, a precise understanding of the virus, its mutations and transmission mechanisms is crucial."
11273,"A recent study by the research group of Principal Investigator Andreas Bergthaler at the CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, in the renowned journal *Science Translational Medicine*, makes an important contribution to this."
11274,"The high quality of epidemiological data in Austria, together with state-of-the-art virus genome sequencing, has supported unprecedented insights of the mutation behavior and transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus."
11275,"&gt;  
&gt;The project ""Mutational dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in Austria"" was launched by CeMM in close cooperation with the Medical University of Vienna at the end of March."
11276,"Together with the Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety (AGES) and in cooperation with numerous universities and hospitals all over Austria, scientists are working on drawing a more precise picture of the virus [mutations](https://medicalxpress.com/tags/mutations/) and transmissions that occur by genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 viruses."
11277,"Under the leadership of CeMM Principal Investigators Andreas Bergthaler and Christoph Bock, 750 samples from important SARS-CoV-2 infection clusters in Austria such as the tourist town of Ischgl and Vienna were phylogenetically and epidemiologically reconstructed and their role in transcontinental virus spread was analyzed."
11278,The results also provide important information on transmission and the development of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
11279,"**On average 1,000 virus particles are transmitted during an infection**

&gt;The results of the current analyses also show that on average 1000 infectious virus particles are transmitted from one infected person to the next."
11280,These values are overall considerably higher than for other viruses such as HIV or noroviruses.
11281,"Andreas Bergthaler adds: ""Yet, occasionally we also found infected people who apparently came into contact with fewer virus particles and still became infected."
11282,"We suspect that parameters such as the application of protective measures, the transmission route or the immune system may play a decisive role here."""
11283,These results raise important new questions and hypotheses.
11284,"Reducing the viral load of infected individuals by a combination of measures such as mouth-nose protection, physical distance and adequate indoor air exchange could play a key role in both preventing the spread of the [virus](https://medicalxpress.com/tags/virus/) and possibly even influence the course of the disease."
11285,"&gt;  
&gt;The current study based on data collected during the early phase of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in spring 2020, provides important insights into the fundamental dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 mutations within patients and during [transmission](https://medicalxpress.com/tags/transmission/) events."
11286,These results support other ongoing research projects aiming at a better understanding and controlling the pandemic.

11388,"""First, by Thanksgiving Day and perhaps as early as Wednesday, all three metrics will flatten out or drop, probably for several days."
11389,This decrease will make it look like things are getting better at the national level.
11390,"Then, in the week following the holiday, our test, case, and death numbers will spike, which will look like a confirmation that Thanksgiving is causing outbreaks to worsen."
11391,"But neither of these expected movements in the data will necessarily mean anything about the state of the pandemic itself."""
11392,Yellow fever is a common requirement.
11393,Those diseases are much worse than covid though
11394,All the spreading that's happening now will increase the deaths in time for Christmas.
11395,It will be a very sad time for many families.
11396,Isn't Stockholm's sport week a few weeks later than Norway's?
11397,"That’s more than reasonable, thanks for the reply!"
11398,Whatever his title was or what he was paid for makes no difference.
11399,The important thing is what he did as former state epidemiologist: spout his gut feelings to any media that would listen to him.
11400,"Viewing the foolhardy (relatively small) Sturgis rally as a spreader model, the potential consequences of nationwide Thanksgiving travel/gatherings is almost too much to imagine."
11401,I-O!
11402,Are you in OH?
11403,"Just did, and it looks like Sweden is one of the absolutely hardest hit countries in Europe (and The world)

Compared to Sweden's neighboring countries, the number of deaths is catastrophically high."
11404,Yup.
11405,Or don’t visit.
11406,Stay in hillbilly land.

11419,Also we're well into the second wave now.
11420,"And austria for example had millions of foreign tourists in the country in the winter season 2020, some of whom brought corona with them."
11421,"In addition, i'm not even seeing that sweden is doing all that much better than austria or switzerland, in fact both countries have fewer deaths."
11422,"It is true that the situation in sweden didn't escalate to complete disaster, which some people predicted, but the kind of smug pride some Swedes are taking in their country's handling of the crises i think is unwarranted by the numbers, especially compared to their neighbours."
11423,"But sure, compare your country to spain and feel superior if that makes you happy."
11424,I don't understand why people can't just not see each other in person.
11425,"I didn’t say should, all I said was the medical people can"
11426,taking a vaccine doesn;t mean you are immune so they need to have immunity test results as well for any of this to work large scale
11427,"Based on experience in overwhelmed areas so far, it's a lot harder to track deaths when they start happening more in the home as well."
11428,Some people have to touch a hot stove and get burned to learn the fire is hot and it's tragic especially when someone like you opens up and shares your wisdom and experience.
11429,Thank you for sharing your  story unfortunately not everyone will listen but some of us do and you've helped us stay that much safer and be that much more careful.
11430,"Just like that,  you're happy to suggest it mandatory to take one of these brand new vaccines?"

11432,Geez...
11433,I mean to be honest not everybody who travels for Thanksgiving is going to get covid.

11444,It will be interesting to see what happens around Christmas.
11445,There are 18 million health care workers in the US.
11446,That could mean almost 20% of health care workers could be immune in a month or two.
11447,Is this record people in hospital or record people with COVID in hospital?
11448,My brother is in the air force and will only have to quarantine for 4 days when he gets to where he will be stationed at.

11451,yes please give my addiction a purpose
11452,Yawn.
11453,Like you know anything about science......
11454,Of course masks are necessary and useful but not enough to contain the spread.
11455,Social distancing is.
11456,No family or friends meeting at home or anyewehe without masks.
11457,Not even with masks if it's for s long time in an enclosed space.
11458,"Without this, masks only slow it a bit."
11459,Good but again not enough.
11460,"Agree, my grandfather (mid 80s) contracted a virus (years ago, not COVID) and it gave him acute onset dementia."
11461,It just sucks that I am a healthy young person who gets the vaccine at the last group.
11462,"Old people, people in risk groups etc could go on a holiday while I am still not Allowed to do anything, just because I get the vaccine the the last."
11463,That just sucks major ass...
11464,Ouch...
11465,"Likely just a employer badge, letter from your employer, or in some cases they may vaccinate at the place of employment (food processing plant for example."
11466,I doubt they make it too strict (yes there may be assholes who try to cut the line but making the people you want vaccinated jump through hoops may reduce the amount that get vaccinated).
11467,Your state should release more detailed information shortly after the CDC makes its recommendation on prioritization.

11472,Things were always looking bad in America.
11473,masks in busy transit venues like airports or train stations aren't that bad.
11474,but only that.
11475,and shouldn't be forced of course.
11476,Excellent!
11477,"Oh it's you again, not interested buddy."
11478,We are doing a zoom meeting get together.
11479,1. deadly virus?
11480,"this is so arbitrary, what do you classify as deadly?"
11481,"to me, a virus that has its survival rate over 90% for the highest risk group(over 99.97% for me) isn't deadly."
11482,maybe to you is.
11483,but as i said this is arbitrary.
11484,"yes it maybe dangerous for some, so we need some precautions NOW."
11485,but only now.
11486,2. i meant after the pandemic.
11487,of course we need some measures now but the pandemic will end sometime (sometime soon i hope).
11488,"and then, 99% of us will be over with these measures and back to normal life."
11489,"3. in the scenario of the pandemic never ending, after a while, yes i'd probably start give into my instincts and live my life like i did."
11490,"i feel like we are getting to the paradox point where we ask ourselves: ""a ship in a harbor is safe, but is that what ships are made for?"""
11491,The netherlands brought down infections and hospital numbers to almost 0 after first wave without wearing any masks.
11492,"Its all about isolation, washing hands, keep social circle small."
11493,"Well, they're not special or an outlier this time unfortunately."
11494,Rest of Europe and the US are doing pretty bad too along with Italy at the same time.
11495,I feel sorry for what they are experiencing...
11496,"That's a horrible comparison, 7/4 = 57%  of the prediction, 90,000/6,000 = 6% of the prediction."
11497,Would be better to say instead of losing 30-1 they lost 2-1.

11510,Surprising suggestion from someone who was very sick in the ICU because of the virus.
11511,Even with the best medical care.
11512,"If he was Joe Six Pack who probably would not have gone to the hospital until he got very sick, he may have died from the virus."
11513,Fuck Donald Trump for politicizing this virus.
11514,"I swear, if he had just come out &amp; said ""wear a mask"" then we'd have seen less deaths."
11515,"Instead, all he did was give a half assed twitter post &amp; proceeded to mock people who wore masks."
11516,"To add insult to injury, he held so many rallies that ended up infecting (and killing) tons of people."
11517,"If we had real leadership from the start, this wouldn't have happened."
11518,"Instead, we have a narcissist who is too proud to admit he was wrong about covid."
11519,"His ego, his desire to always appear right about everything, is what led to this disaster."
11520,Real leaders admit when they are wrong &amp; fix things.
11521,Trump has made stupid statements &amp; STILL hasn't acknowledged the rising cases/deaths.
11522,It doesn't help that he delayed stimulus aid by forcing the senate to focus on nominating Amy Coathanger Barrett.
11523,Oh go crawl back under your rock.
11524,Potentially but the Oxford one doesn't need deep freeze to transport which is much more accessible for this kind of work.

11539,Masks mandatory indoors.

11546,"I guess that does matter, since Sweden had almost 10% of its population outside of Sweden, mostly in  the Alps such as Italy, Switzerland and Austria, when the virus first started hitting Europe."
11547,So in my opinion it would be unfair to compare Sweden to countries that were less hard hit ln the beginning.
11548,I've found I enjoy wearing them a lot more in colder weather.
11549,And I do like that people are less likely to bother me when I am out and about.

Source?"
11551,No I disagree with that.
11552,We need to do what we can to stop the virus at all costs.
11553,I believe we should mandate the vaccine.
11554,Swedes have been saying since spring that they can't do the same measures than their neighbours because of their laws.

11564,@ny busy nightclub in the USA is a super spreader right now.
11565,Glad to see more vaccines coming out.
11566,It’ll only help the consumer
11567,In Australia we had political leaders urge that healthcare workers are not the first line of defence - they should be considered the **last** line of defence.
11568,"I'd imagine all the developed countries will donate the vacines they don't need 

But ordered"
11569,Break...
11570,If you actually look at how the virus first came to those countries it is very different but I guess you don't want to do any more research than just comparing numbers when there is alot more nuance to it.
11571,It says Goal =&gt; Herd immunity.

11579,People travelling and gathering for Thanksgiving celebration.
11580,And everyone rushing into crowdy stores on Black Friday.
11581,What could possibly go wrong?
11582,[removed]
11583,The people dying today were infected three weeks ago.
11584,Three weeks ago cases were like 85-95k/day.
11585,"We've doubled cases since then, so we should expect daily deaths to double in the next three weeks - without even taking Thanksgiving spread into account."
11586,Also https://i.imgur.com/Fa8ZKew.jpg
11587,I had the same thought.
11588,"Throwing around big 'US equivalent' numbers makes it appear, to a layman, as if the US is actually doing well in comparison."
11589,"Also, notice how they listed the 'US equivalent' numbers in decreasing order, so the biggest numbers appear first?"
11590,LMAO
11591,"Sweden had 10% of its population outside of Sweden when the virus came to Europe, do you really think it is a realistic goal to eliminate the virus?"
11592,Bet you if I asked for sources behind any of these claims it will only come back with opinion pieces.
11593,I think they need to tighten the restrictions even more to get the numbers down.
11594,They’ve sat at this level for 4 weeks already and it’s not working enough.
11595,"Whoa... this is brutal, not gonna lie."
11596,"Good for those that don't want to wait for the science of what the repurcussions, if any, will be."

11605,Selfish altruism at work.
11606,I noticed the same parallels between covid and climate change.
11607,It’s the exact same portion of the population who denies them because it’s not economically convient to accept the truth.
11608,This is why Boris Johnson’s “5 days at Christmas everything will be fine if we take a break from COVID “ is so dangerous
11609,It seems most people get symptoms faster than two full weeks.
11610,"That said, it seems silly to change when things are this bad."

11644,"There are no sides to this issue, only individual people making the individual choice to wear masks and quarantine, or not to."
11645,Their thought process is simple - it's a basic cost/benefit analysis.
11646,"If they find that, individually, the mask benefits them more than it irritates, they put it on."
11647,"If not, they don't."
11648,"For many, the fact that the mask offers them some small amount of protection contributes more to their decision than the huge protection it offers to others."

11655,Smartphone programs to help warn people they have been near someone that tested positive is science.

11708,"I wear a mask to protect the elderly and vulnerable populations, because unlike children, the risk to them is much much greater than the seasonal flu."
11709,I’m glad you find wearing a mask equivalent to putting on pants in the morning.
11710,I don’t.
11711,"I find them uncomfortable and depressing, due to the suppression of human communication that comes along with wearing them."
11712,"Humans socialize and communicate through voice, body language and facial expressions."
11713,It is rather depressing to have a large aspect of that communication absent from society.
11714,Masks suck.
11715,**But they are a necessary evil right now**.
11716,"The risk of the seasonal flu is a risk that we all tolerate, unless you’re Howie Mandel of course."
11717,"Besides, the whole point of this was never about eliminating viral death from society."
11718,It was about making sure hospitals can operate at normal capacity without being overrun.
11719,"They can with the current flu risk level, so if we can get covid -19 to a similar risk level there is no end for the preventative measures we are currently taking."
11720,It’s information that doesn’t change the risk assessment.
11721,Good description.
11722,"These are true hallmarks of the prototypical ""self-righteous douche bag""."
11723,"Great, everything will go super smooth then."
11724,I can't wait and I'll sleep well tonight.
11725,Climate change wouldn't be the ongoing existential crisis it is right now if we weren't all pretty daft as a whole.
11726,No idea about OP but I have a bio background and just the one building where I did my degree research had dozens of-80 C freezers.
11727,"So biotech, biology research, perhaps some of the other applied hard sciences."
11728,It makes me wonder if even some of the smaller college campuses could be distribution hubs.
11729,"Same, I am totally confused, hospitals were pretty full here but there was no collapse..In face all the temporary hospitals didnt even have to be used."
11730,No.
11731,It's the opposite: Technocracy is called authoritarianism by some people.
11732,You could save 15% or more with Geico...
11733,I think regardless of your position on pandemic public health measures the messages in the last 8 months have been extremely poor and opaque.
11734,I would also argue that a lot of people(and governments/the media) in the last 8 months are doing a lot of skewing themselves.
11735,"Come up with a approach and cherry pick data to support it, or find the worse parameters and broadcast them to the public."
11736,If the death rate goes down(it has) focus on the cases.
11737,Or focus on the countries that are doing the worst.
11738,So yeah I think we are all skewing.
11739,😂 So post the link to it.
11740,You're not even a plausible troll.
11741,"And, the fact that child rape is the first thing that popped into your head when someone pointed out that you're wrong is seriously gross."
11742,Seek help.
11743,"Selfish assholes are quickly pushing this country to the edge where we're going to have to start standing up for what's right, even if it costs us something we didn't really want to give."
11744,"Do you really think our ancestors played it safe all the time, or do you think maybe they stood up for what was right?"
11745,We've just been living rent-free off of their sacrifices and that's unfortunately probably coming to an end sooner than anyone would have expected or wanted.
11746,"""He give us a lot of money"" - Republicans."

11751,I just feel so strongly about this.
11752,"My mom is 86 and has COPD and I've only seen her twice, at a distance, since March, my 19 year old niece lives with her and is immunosuppressed after organ transplants, my 18 year old daughter's life is on hold and she's stir-crazy, we've all been isolating since the end of February and it is so *frustrating* to see, after all of this, these anti-maskers continuing to help make things worse."
11753,😭
11754,Trump has basically staked his entire reputation on vaccines.
11755,I'm not worried about Rural Americans getting vaccinated it.
11756,"I am, however, worried about the far too large contingent of pseudo-intellectuals on the left who have been expressing a ton of reservations about getting vaccinated."
11757,"I'm as big a doomsdayer as anyone, but that's not true."
11758,"If you are masking up and distancing in public, but someone in your pod gets it, it'll spread around your pod but then stop and not spread to other pods."

11769,My wife is a nurse and she has plenty of coworkers who are anti-mask plandemic types.
11770,Its really fucking bizarre to me.
11771,We don’t know the vaccine will make us immune.
11772,But we’re going to try.
11773,"Deaths were 10 times higher than Nordic neighbours, and actually their economy was also slightly worse than their Nordic neighbours, but otherwise above average in the EU."
11774,And you also hear stories about people who can swim who suddenly drown and die.
11775,It’s extremely rare.
11776,"Having a few dozen kids with underlying conditions die of covid is no doubt a tragedy, but when you compare that to the number of covid deaths over 65, the number of kids is statistically negligible."
11777,I wish people understood the sizes of numbers and how they compare to each other more.
11778,Hahahah
11779,"Right, I mean, coolers all the way down, but a freezer that will hold -60 is likely better insulated (and actively cools to -60) than any other reasonable cooler."
11780,"With a large budget, you could put the -60 freezer in a walkin freezer, and then have another peltier powered freezer inside of it to get an additional temperature differential below the -60."
11781,"(With the understanding that efficiency goes to shit, and you're going to need roughly an order of magnitude more cooling power for each stage in the cascade)"
11782,"Exactly why we need mandates, travel bans, etc."
11783,Guess you're fucked if you can't have vaccines for health reasons.
11784,&gt;Has it always been this way?
11785,Hadn't noticed it was this bad before.
11786,Been that way for a while.
11787,The pandemic plus the current political discourse have just made it more obvious.
11788,Lol thats not going to happen.
11789,"Its taken like 9 months to kill what, 250k?"
11790,And there are vaccines coming soon.
11791,Even vaccinating the oldest 10% of the country would probably cut the number of people dying down by at least 50% bare min.
11792,My guess is covid will have killed around 325k Americans by the time its over.

11797,"Nope, not yet."
11798,"Soon I'll go in for a 2-month check-in, at which point I'll ask I suppose."
11799,Even then there have been under 100 million doses across all vaccine candidates produced so far.
11800,The good news is that much of the infrastructure to rapidly scale up production has happened so the pace of vaccine development will greatly increase going into early next year.

11805,"Also, the people ending up in the ICU’s aren’t the ones spreading it around all over, they’re not exactly getting out and about."
11806,The asymptomatic carries are the most worrisome.

11823,Flu shot options depend on where you live.
11824,"In the states, a lot of pharmacies are now having people fill out paperwork ahead of time, online."
11825,I know CVS has you fill out the paperwork online when you book an appointment.
11826,I heard some places even offer drive-up flu clinics or flu shots via a service window.
11827,"Flu shots are also available at doctors offices and medical clinics, if you are in the states and have insurance."
11828,"A lot of providers are trying to mitigate exposure risk for both patients and vaccine administrators, so it may be less public exposure time this year because of those covid precautions put in place."
11829,It’s always a good idea to call around and ask what the procedure is this year and see if that fits with your comfort level.
11830,For real.
11831,"We have video calling tech and it's only one, maybe two years."

11901,I think you misunderstood my initial comment.
11902,I'm saying that they've woefully underreported both cases and deaths because their ability to collect such data is limited.
11903,"The healthcare isn't bad at the for-profit private hospitals, but I have no experience with the public hospitals."
11904,"I know they have the lowest number of ICU beds per capita of any country in the world, so that by iself should lead to an increased CFR."
11905,"I do find it plausible, however, that their immune systems have seen something similar enough to SARS-COV-2 in the past to mount a moderately effective immune response and the country is mostly very hot and very humid."
11906,"Cool, dry air facilitates the spread of the virus."
11907,I also suspect that there is pressure from the Modi government to keep numbers low.

11979,Moreover the NCLEX covers a lot that material and is specifically designed to present more questions related to material it finds the test taker to be weak on.
11980,So if a test taker is weak in Pediatrics the test will literally offer Peds questions again and again and again.
11981,"Moreover, the NCLEX continually adjusts itself to present harder and harder questions to the test taker, giving each question a difficulty score."

12029,"In my part of the Bay Area, everyone's been wearing them since March."
12030,I can't remember the last time I saw someone in public without one.
12031,lmao this.
12032,"i work with an anti-mask nutjob, and that's his go-to position on everything, including deodorant, washing his hands after he shits, and doing any of the work he's getting paid for--can't tell him what to do, etc etc."
12033,"this is antisocial behavior, and i'd say people like this really do belong out in the woods somewhere, but even varmints have standards and i don't want to insult them."
12034,"you pay for the benefits of society by participating in it, and if you don't want to hold up the social contract fuck off to the desert or something."
12035,"Wow, they have to *sign a form*!"
12036,That’ll stop them.
12037,"Nope, not interested in welding anyone anywhere."
12038,I’m just saying that people acting like their personal liberties are being curtailed when we’re just trying to keep a new-to-humans virus from ripping through the population are dumb.
12039,You’re entitled to your life??
12040,I’m entitled to mine!
12041,So who wins?
12042,Also in the 1918 flu there were protests against the safety measures as well.
12043,Freeduuuumb !
12044,It wasn’t a lie.
12045,There was no evidence masks were effective.
12046,"It wasn’t like there was some giant study that was peer reviewed and replicated saying masks were great, but Fauci etc lied about it."
12047,Any evidence was (and mostly remains) circumstantial or correlation/causation.
12048,The only thing that changed was public pressure to appear to be doing something.
12049,How do you deal with all the stupid around you?
12050,Just keep your head down or what?
12051,I didn’t give a fuck enough to read past the first sentence lmaoo
12052,Where the fuck do these people come from?
12053,OANN is super dangerous disinformation and there’s quite a few suckers out there who fall for it
12054,Idk what I can do here.
12055,My cousin took a flight from Minnesota to El Paso and her work just told her when she arrived that one of her co-workers she was working with tested positive.
12056,And shortly after arriving started feeling symptoms and tested positive.
12057,She exposed everyone on the airplane and now visiting her parents exposing them.
12058,What was the desision which you found so astounding?
12059,[deleted]
12060,That's why I like him.
12061,"I disagree with 90% of Catholicism, or did."
12062,The pancake dinners were nice 👌
12063,I think the efficacy of full shutdown is far less than that of people wearing masks.
12064,"Another study just today finding that if at least 70% of people wore masks consistently, the virus would be contained in six weeks."
12065,I've not seen and study saying anything like that for full shutdowns.
12066,I do believe in some shutdowns but clearly not all.
12067,Nursing requires a certain amount of contact hours and a national exam.
12068,"The exam has a high fail rate, and the questions on it are not first or second order questions."
12069,The school you go to has to have a certain pass rate for the exam or it's nursing program will lose accreditation as well.
12070,There are no online programs for nursing.
12071,There are online NP programs and programs that bridge Registered Nurses to BSNs provided they already have their associates and have passed the NCLEX.
12072,The NP programs still require a certain amount of clinical hours.
12073,If you want to talk about scope creep of NPs and PAs I am totally in agreement.
12074,"Speaking as a teacher who just got her ass sat down in quarantine thanks to a positive student, that teacher friend has xx number of kids just ready to bring covid into their life every day."
12075,I have one friend I hang out with rarely outside and distanced.
12076,"She works from home, but I'm not about to risk giving it to her unknowingly, so we don't hang out inside or close by."
12077,"Would be ideal, but if I were to pick 1, I would probably choose taxes."
12078,"Malaria which *IS* a life threatening disease constitutes as a vaccination that would be necessary if you were going to a place like Congo, or Nigeria."
12079,I am not going to apologize that I do not consider coronavirus as something that requires vaccination.
12080,"It has been made pretty clear as to why people die from it (pre-existing conditions), and there has also been information provided on how to mitigate its effects if you do happen to catch it."
12081,"In the beginning, I was worried about Coronavirus."
12082,"I was supportive of all the measures to try and eradicate this virus, but as time has progressed, it has been quite apparent that nobody knows what the fuck they are doing to manage it."
12083,Not surprising to say the least when you look at how poorly run things are on this planet.
12084,"I had to stop looking into the data because, as stated previously, things were not adding up."
12085,"Fill yourself with the narrative all you want, continue with the shaming all you want."
12086,None of this is new.
12087,I've repeatedly said to COVID conspiracy theorists to head to the hospital in a major city and ask about the legitimacy of COVID.
12088,Not a single one of them has had the balls to backup their beliefs and do it.
12089,"When the nurses and doctors finally see the end of this pandemic and finally get some free time, there's going to be HELL to pay for the first person they come across that starts ranting about it being fake."
12090,Yeah right.... What's the next news Hongkong have full democratic freedom?
12091,When did Sweden pursue a herd immunity strategy?
12092,"Then if you take that into account, and the reports of a strong correlation with the air quality then India should have at least four times the amount of deaths than America at the very least!"
12093,But that’s just not the case.
12094,"It’s got roughly half the recorded deaths and almost four times the people, worse air quality, worse healthcare and the only difference that I can see is that India uses HCQ for treatment."

12104,"Yeah, but I understand their position."
12105,"They have to pay their staff, and if she's not there, another kid will be."
12106,"And if they accept a new enrollment because we withdraw, they're not going to kick the new kid out in a few months."
12107,"Maybe things will be bad enough for the county to shut preschools again - not that I hope so exactly, it would solve my problem but be a huge one for others."
12108,I hope you are able to get your virtual job.
12109,Stay safe.
12110,Why does the author even bother?
12111,It is now an 8 month old meme that authoritarianism is the blanket excuse used by Americans to unilaterally dismiss any attempt to even try to learn anything at all from China’s pandemic control measures.
12112,But since then it is clear that Americans still won’t learn even when those same COVID response measures are given a democratic sugarcoating in other countries successful responses.
12113,"Azar may have visited Taiwan to allegedly “learn from the best about pandemic control”, but clearly was more interested in sticking it to China with a diplomatic blown raspberry than doing jack-squat about the virus."
12114,What recourse is there for a people who don’t even want to try to fix their sorry state.
12115,no really since normal gas use has decreased drastically.
12116,So it would be hard to seperate the variables.
12117,Maybe people smarter than me would be able to do it.

12129,I might have voted Trump because I hated Hillary.
12130,I could care less about gun rights.
12131,And I am a minority.
12132,And I would like every anti-masker’s name recorded and put them last in the hospital triage when they get sick.
12133,And have anti-maskers illegible for covid-related health insurance expenses.
12134,"Jesus, what's the big problem Americans have with the mask."
12135,I've been trying to wrap my head around it.
12136,This move doesn't surprise me at all.
12137,I was in KSA when covid first hit.
12138,"The King proclaimed the government would take care of all covid medical expenses for everyone, including citizens and noncitizens."
12139,They took the virus seriously.
12140,"Public prayers were cancelled, and they even cancelled Hajj."
12141,Curfews were enforced.
12142,I went through several police checkpoints when I left -- movement was restricted to control the virus.
12143,By all accounts it's working.
12144,I returned to the US to find absolute chaos and no plan whatsoever.
12145,I'm not sure if the King is sincere about caring about people or if this is just PR.
12146,But what's the difference?
12147,I have always felt safe and welcome in the Kingdom.
12148,I'm sure the usual brigade will come here shortly to tell me everything that's so *eeeevil* about Saudi Arabia.

12158,"This attitude of, ""well they were in their 60s/70s/80s"" is so shocking."

12160,Exactly.
12161,Tax policy is a political disagreement.
12162,A global pandemic is not.
12163,Hey people kill for lots of reasons
12164,It's really sad because we know statistically there will be face to face transmissions across the table at Thanks Giving dinner..... if only they could see their breath just killed someone they care about deeply.
12165,Really sad.
12166,Can you add to this to further elaborate on your post?
12167,"By ""seeing community spread"", you mean, most of the cases you see who are in the hospital?"
12168,"That is, most people who end up getting it and going to the hospital are ones who got it at work, who were trying their best to be careful but had to go out for work etc?"
12169,Thank you.
12170,"Are you saying that governors should refrain from doing their due diligence, and out of abundance of caution, set up a secondary, independent review of the vaccine(s)?"
12171,Mmm 12 isn’t a lot of fridges lol
12172,Huh?
12173,Tuesday’s are one of the lowest death reporting days of the week?
12174,It’s literally been the highest reported death total of any day of the week by a substantial margin.
12175,You can get your point across without outright lying.
12176,"Think I hate a breaking point today... just so tired of hearing constant bad news, my anxiety and depression is through the fucking roof"
12177,No they're not.
12178,I live in Georgia.
12179,You know what every family wants for Christmas?
12180,A funeral.
12181,"That way not only do you get to make this Christmas miserable, but you get to remember it every year after that."
12182,It makes the festivities extra jolly.
12183,And go ahead and post a study on general public non-medical mask effectiveness from SARS1 if you think there must surely be studies.
12184,Duh!
12185,Public schools are junk.
12186,The only people that don't use private schools are the people that can't afford it.....
12187,Including almost all government employees....lol
12188,Fuck off with that noise.
12189,They've worked the entire pandemic because grocery stores needed to be open.
12190,I see you country does fine brainwashing.
12191,Same reason why people in *Pandemic* listened to some online blogger who spends his free time stalking A  University of California San Francisco research scientist - they're scared and nobody is giving anybody a straight answer
12192,"The interview is 40 minutes long, you replied after 16."
12193,"Again, what havoc?"
12194,News media in the US need to show more raw  footage of this virus and the suffering and death it causes.
12195,Those that don’t take this seriously are pretty much sheep like in mentality.
12196,"If they can get a better view of this, we could make a bigger impact."
12197,"I remember when Italy was at peak last spring, tons of footage of people gasping for air, flipped on their stomachs."
12198,If we continue to have nurses in their cars crying and just heat that they “are almost at capacity”.
12199,"People will still not take social distancing, mask usage seriously."
12200,Hospital overload.
12201,Also if you are in the hospital it's bad.
12202,"Ah, if only every denier would actually read about things instead of just using Sweden as an example of how we should handle the pandemic in the states."
12203,"Covid has wiped out whatever hope I had for humanity, it’s sad to feel that way but here I am"
12204,Ours or theirs?
12205,We in the States have no room to talk right now.
12206,Well if people have to get the vaccine and it spaces out how the lines etc happen...why not?
12207,When the H1N1 shot came out...I drove 3 hours and lined up in the dark to get it.
12208,We sent various family members to different sites in the wee hours of the morning to get it.
12209,I was pregnant and that virus seemed to hit pregnant women very hard.
12210,Once the essential workers have had the vaccine..who cares where people get it as long as they can get it if they want.
12211,I have a better idea.
12212,I'll show you a country that wiretaps its citizens like no other country ever does.

12218,No.

12220,"But the new law does allow interested U.S. residents to access USAGM content, upon request."

12226,It seems the difference with WWII rationing was that the government enforced it more than they're doing with COVID measures.
12227,I wonder if COVID prevention measures are gonna get this treatment in the history books 50 years from now.
12228,"""Everyone banded together to stop the spread!"""
12229,I am curious if educators are going to be a high priority on the vaccination distribution.
12230,Start looking for those 8k a week nursing jobs.
12231,Sorry for your loss.
12232,I'm in this camp too.
12233,My friends pretty much got annoyed with me for refusing to attend a birthday party.
12234,The person who organized has pretty much stopped talking to me.
12235,"Not a lot of people around us have been infected so in their minds this isn't serious at all, but that's not how viruses work."
12236,But there are bigger things going on in the world so I don't really care.
12237,Just sucks.
12238,"I made it a point to watch it in March, when HBO picked up the license."
12239,"It was a watch party actually and everyone was saying - “whose this director, he’s so accurate!”  A few minutes later they started nitpicking - “such and such wasn’t realistic ."
12240,".”

That was eight months ago and everything else from the film has since come to pass."
12241,The only significant aspect that it failed to predict was a presidential administration which wasn’t even interested in trying.
12242,"So they can't act like publishers, because then they'd lose the protection that allows them to continue publishing, sorry, *disseminating* propaganda?"
12243,"Oh darn, shucks."
12244,What is the issue here.
12245,How is this good for anyone but propagandists?
12246,Why should I give a shit if they lose this protection.
12247,The goivernment has to pass more stimulus for people to stay home and get paid.
12248,It's what is required right now in my mind.
12249,Definitely correct.

12254,"So retaliation, rather than “coming together.” Even after beating them in war, the nazis never stopped marching here."

12259,He lost let's forget his fat ass please
12260,Another thing people rarely mention is that the effect of masks depends on how many infected people are around you.
12261,"If there are no infected people, the masks can't prevent any infections."
12262,"It took us a while to figure out that the virus was actually rampant in a lot of communities, and that contagious people could have no idea they were infected."
12263,Once we learned those things it really shifted the calculus in favor of wearing masks everywhere because we now know there are infected people everywhere.
12264,Yup.
12265,"Also the spike of people looking to get tested thinking if they test negative they can have the biggest, highest risk gathering they can possibly put together without any worries."
12266,Wait for the 2nd week of December.
12267,Spoiler: it's gonna suck.
12268,"These people, man..."
12269,They don't give any respect but only demand respect and then get offended when they get called out for their bs.
12270,"It was very recent that we read the number of 60k, maybe 2 weeks ago?"
12271,Exactly.
12272,It will make you feel 22 years younger for exactly 3:39 seconds.
12273,"Oh, but you are."
12274,Because it’s going to be like 4 months before any of those vaccines are going to be made available to the general public.
12275,This is only going to confuse people into making them think they need to get a vaccine right away when the ones that really need them first are the health care workers.
12276,If this article were published in February 2021 this would make a little more sense.
12277,&gt;	Masks suck.
12278,I feel like I’m living in crazy town when I see people talk on this sub and my local sub about how much they enjoy wearing them.
12279,"Yeah, I wear them because I’m supposed to, but I can’t fucking stand doing it."
12280,They fog up my glasses and are just generally uncomfortable.
12281,Don’t understand how anyone could enjoy them.

12285,"The way he talks, he seems to think that he can just walk into a CVS a month from now and get a shot."

12287,He's a moron.
12288,So can people in China.
12289,And they don't have to risk getting infected or get relative infected.

12300,&gt;it has been quite apparent that nobody knows what the fuck they are doing to manage it.
12301,I live in Taiwan and we have managed the coronavirus near perfectly.
12302,We have had zero domestic cases for over 250 days now and we are still sourcing &amp; developing vaccines.
12303,"Probably so, and I think that's the right decision."
12304,And for what it's worth I'm in probably one of the last/lowest priority groups and am itchin to fly.
12305,You won't be eligible before them.
12306,"The point is once it's offered to you, don't hesitate."
12307,It is beneficial to be vaccinated.

They claim that basically ALL government responses were completely ineffectual at depressing covid death rates 

https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2020.604339/full#SM6

&gt;The government's responses (i.e., the severity index and the containment and health index) are strongly correlated with the second factorial axis (Figures 2, 4)."
12791,The death rate from Covid-19 is not correlated with this axis.
12792,"Therefore, the death rate appears not to be linked with the responses of governments."
12793,"&gt;The third axis shows a relationship between Covid-19 mortality and longitude as well as obesity and sedentarity (Figures 4, 5)."
12794,American countries have a higher obesity rate and a higher Covid-19 mortality rate; Asian countries have lower obesity rates and lower Covid-19 mortality rates.
12795,"&gt;The correlation matrix (Figure 6) shows that the Covid-19 mortality rate is positively correlated to a group of variables composed of the inactive lifestyle (r = 0.46, p &lt; 10−6), obesity rate (r = 0.55, p &lt; 10−11), GDP (r = 0.40, p &lt; 10−7), economic support index (r = 0.31, p &lt; 10−3), life expectancy (r = 0.50, p &lt; 10−11), burden of mortality due to CVD (r = 0.33, p &lt; 10−3), cancer (r = 0.47, p &lt; 10−9), and deviation from latitude 0 (r = 0.41, p &lt; 10−3)."
12796,"The mortality rate due to Covid-19 is negatively correlated to another group of variables composed of the mortality rate from infectious diseases (r = −0.50, p &lt; 10−9), the progression of life expectancy (r = −0.37, p &lt; 10−4), longitude (r = −0.36, p &lt; 10−3), the deviation from optimum temperature (r = −0.39, p &lt; 10−5), UV index (r = −0.37, p &lt; 10−43)."
12797,"&gt;There is no significant correlation with the deviation from optimum humidity (r = 0.03, p = 0.52), the containment and health index (r = 0.07, p = 0.51), the original stringency index (r = 0.07, p = 0.36), and population size (r = −0.05, p = 0.35)."

13004,What's a high number for a particular illness?
13005,Why do you think 20% is low?
13006,It seems astronomical.
13007,"That company makes masks now, I have a box of BYD masks from Costco right next to me."
13008,"Their approval for N95s was delayed, and they paid back an agreed upon amount of money for failure to meet deadlines."

13038,"btw, thanks for sharing your story about the June outbreak."
13039,Nah.
13040,But I wouldn't doubt 4 to 5 weeks after Thanksgiving seeing a few 3000+ dying a day.
13041,"If we get to the point of 5000 dying a day, we are getting completely shut down, martial law style."

13065,No cooloff period
13066,I was a soldier for a short time (mandatory service) and they do the same thing on the glass inside the gas mask.
13067,A cloth soaked in a surface active agent comes with every gas mask package.
13068,"So I did the same to my glasses, apply soap/shampoo/toothpaste/whatever that contains SAA."
13069,But then there are anti-fog agent products specifically for this purpose...
13070,I only recently learned this.

13072,"If the government and states and local leadership actually took a leadership role, they would plaster this and all the other potentially life-long issues people may face if they get Covid months down the road."

13081,It keeps riding up and pokeing me in my eyes.
13082,I don't know what you tried in masks but maybe if you keep at it.
13083,I tried several different types of cloth masks and a found one that feels comfortable.
13084,It's 3 layers and is made out of polyester or/and cotton with a bamboo viscose lining.
13085,I also use mask extenders.
13086,"Unfortunately, it took some money and time before I found a mask I can wear."

13097,"Dude, wtf are you on?"
13098,I've been going to costco for years and what you're saying makes no sense.
13099,They don't put it near the working class?
13100,"Wtf are you talking about, lol."
13101,"It's a MASSIVE fucking store, they'll only build them where space exists."
13102,"Where would you have them located to serve ""the working class""?"
13103,Downtown?
13104,"Not to mention you don't have to be a member to use their pharmacy, which happens to be the cheapest anywhere."
13105,"AND they now have standalone stores selling their storebrand, just in case you can't afford a costco membership."
13106,I wonder how many lives could have been saved if the democrats and republicans made a bipartisan effort to get everyone to wear a mask and socially distance?
13107,They died of lightning strike while covid positive
13108,There's already multiple strains of it like the flu.

13110,"A wise man will be forced to wait a bit, because the wise man, and the foolish man, and every other type of man will be waiting until the medical workers and the elderly are all vaccinated, and that will take months."
13111,You don’t think more and more people are becoming more relaxed about the whole thing?
13112,It seems like it to me.
13113,"I'd rather go broke and not have to deal with the trauma of seeing so many people die tbh, no amount of money makes that shit okay."
13114,More the same way we unified in anger and vengeance in the days after 9/11.
13115,"Not saying it was good or righteous, but we were definitely united."
13116,"For many, things that they can't see or experience first hand just aren't something to worry about."
13117,We can't for instance drop bombs on covid to get it back for killing our people.
13118,At least I don't think we can.
13119,Hold up...
13120,It seems that we could possibly bomb covid.
13121,"The civilian populations would suffer horrific casualties, but I guess it's doable."
13122,"&gt;A leading Chinese vaccine developer has applied for authorization to bring its Covid-19 shot to the market, seeking to get a jump on Western rivals as the race for a working inoculation against the virus enters the final stretch."
13123,"&gt;  
&gt;China National Biotec Group Co. has submitted an application to Chinese regulators, reported state media Xinhua Finance on Wednesday, citing parent company Sinopharm’s vice general manager Shi Shengyi."
13124,The application likely includes interim data from the company’s Phase III human testing conducted in the Middle East and South America.

13128,Just in time for Christmas!
13129,My mom works somewhere where masks need to be worn and customers always ask her “why don’t you say anything to the maskless customers?” I tell her not to say anything for this exact reason.
13130,Higher up management can say something if they want.
13131,A person not wearing a mask at this point is likely irrational and unpredictable.
13132,And much much more likely to be armed.
13133,It’s not worth her safety to tell them to wear a mask.
13134,&gt; an individual actor can never change systemic problems.
13135,Rosa Parks says 'hello'.
13136,&gt; a thread about someone being killed for asking someone to wear a mask.
13137,"wasn't killed, he was shot in the calf."
13138,She clearly did though

13140,SO FUCKING WHAT?
13141,My point still stands.
13142,No.
13143,They’re acting like people act.
13144,I don’t give a shit what people do because they were gunna do it regardless.
13145,100% the fault of the federal government.
13146,Not where I am in San Diego unfortunately.
13147,"One lady said she had medical exemption and was harassing her when I simply asked, ""hey, did your mask fall off?"""
13148,Or public transportation workers.
13149,Or grocery workers.
13150,There's tons of people that have been and continue to be out in the world during this pandemic.
13151,"Also in the top 3 urbanised populations in the world, with 85% of the population in 3 cities, and 95% of the population living within 50km of the coast."
13152,"If Australia’s island status is so great, what’s up with Puerto Rico, Hawaii, the Phillipines, the UK, Sri Lanka?"
13153,Covid got away from us.
13154,"The federal government paid people to stay home, and the states closed their borders and enforced serious lockdowns."
13155,I’d like to point out our tiny population in comparison comes with tiny resources in comparison to the US to do the same thing we did.
13156,You are the wealthiest nation on Earth.
13157,What is it for if not for this?
13158,One of those persons is only **27 years old**...
13159,I disagree.
13160,$500 is a serious chunk of change for many people and even though this is far from a perfect system it will serve as a deterrent for some
13161,You sure b?
13162,That's not my understanding...
13163,So stupid whoever that was.
13164,Someone's life could be threatened depending on who she exposes.
13165,And I thought gougers were overcharging for NIOSH-approved respirators...
13166,The M@GA death cult under T4ump.
13167,Fact free p0litics in a fact free world leading to people's demise.
13168,I have a feeling a large number of these covid deaths are current or former smokers.
13169,That's why I want to see stats on who is filling up the hospital beds.
13170,These are the people who need to be isolated.
13171,It's not rocket science.
13172,There has to be a common theme.
13173,Or it's just part of natural selection.
13174,What's a computer expert doing commenting on covid-19?
13175,Not saying he isn't smart but he's not a doctor.
13176,That's like a doctor commenting on the stock market
13177,What a sadly sick country.
13178,"No, there will also be inspection teams at highway exits, and no one will be allowed to leave town without a nucleic acid negative certificate."
13179,Beijing xin fa di June outbreak is like this
13180,I'm starting to think the everyone doing Thanksgiving anyway idea is not the denial phase of grief but actually the acceptance phase.
13181,"That when people say, ""It might be my last Thanksgiving with grandma,"" they actually mean that subconsciously."
13182,As if everyone just expects this unavoidable deluge this winter and can't be bothered to try and fight it anymore.
13183,Scary.
13184,You literally can not go to an NBA game in the states now.
13185,You can not go to a concert like before.
13186,You are living under restrictions whether you like it or not.
13187,Keep putting the blame on your government but don’t act like citizens aren’t to blame either for the ongoing disaster there.
13188,I have respiratory issues and I hike with a mask—with elevation gain.
13189,A face shield is a secondary layer meant to add another layer of protection to your mask and eye protection.
13190,It is not stand alone protection for the wearer or for those near the wearer.
13191,"If you have that great of a challenge with wearing a mask, such as those who require a nasal cannula, it is probably a good idea to stay out of stores and have whatever you need delivered."
13192,"Let’s be honest, the vast majority of people who are anti-mask don’t have breathing issues."
13193,They have attitude issues.
13194,"People who do have actual breathing issues are for the most part scared shitless that they are going to go out, acquire something they need like food or toilet paper and end up in the ER and intubated a few days later."
13195,Wearing a mask is a minor thing.
13196,I get that it creates humidity.
13197,"Because I hike at full heart-rate, when wearing a mask, the brim of my ball cap gets soaked and I have to wash my cap after my hike."
13198,"Even before COVID, I would wear a gator in below zero temps, especially if there is wind, to prevent frost nip on my nose."
13199,(First degree burns.)
13200,The gator gets wet.
13201,"Now, my mask gets wet."
13202,It’s annoying.
13203,I’d rather not wear a mask.
13204,"However, just like I don’t want first degree burns on my nose, I don’t want to end up alone in a hospital bed upside down shitting myself."
13205,"So, I distance."
13206,I wear a mask.
13207,I wear eye protection.
13208,I feel like a huge dork.
13209,"But given the direction of the numbers and the fact that multiple vaccines are on their way, I cam wear a mask for a few more months."
13210,"Most importantly, if people had just worn masks, maintained an appropriate distance, and adapted to a few small lifestyle changes for the incredibly short amount of time that this pandemic will ultimately be, we all could have lived somewhat regular lives... Like the people in many of the countries in the Southern Hemisphere get to."
13211,"But, no."
13212,"Despite the fact that people in a lot Asia already wear masks all the time, in North America wearing a mask is some kind of assault of personal freedoms."
13213,"As were putting on seatbelts, wearing helmets when riding, and probably a half-dozen other things that were meant to assure the safety of the wearer but met with a great deal of resistance."
13214,"Anyway, for the people who legitimately do have trouble breathing, for yourself and especially for your loved ones, you can wear a mask in public until the vaccine is deployed."
13215,The vaccine.
13216,"Dear god, we’re completely fucked."
13217,Lol....After Wuhan virus outbreak went out of hand thoudands of pro PRC minion mushroomed on all social media platforms.
13218,"Their only job is to follow Corona virus related posts, come in mases to spread misinformation, propaganda and leave negative remark for  any comments made against Xijinpin or China."
13219,This account is one of them.
13220,Look at the down votes my comment or similar comments get on Reddit.
13221,Are you too naive to understand where these down votes are coming?.
13222,BTW I don't need to be on Payroll to speak the right if I am one of the imapcted  from the virus.
13223,Sweden probably has less than half its cases detected.
13224,It took 3-4 months of ramping up testing until people with small symptoms were allowed to test themselves.
13225,"Before that, only doctor ordered tests were done.."
13226,"Yeah, I'm unlikely to lose my job due to covid."
13227,"But even if I did I'd get unemployment from the state, and on the unlikely case there'll be some time where I can't service the mortgage I'd just call up the bank, explain the situation, and they'd ask me how long they should collect interest only, and if I need a loan to get over that time."

13234,"My roommate decided to go drive a few towns over to visit his family for Thanksgiving 🙃 he was originally super tight about COVID protocols in our house, and he stayed home for 2 weeks and got tested before going, but I have no idea how his family approaches it."
13235,It's not really my business but I guess the paranoia is getting to me.
13236,"I want to make it through, I've been lucky so far and I'm scared for my loved ones."
13237,I wish people paid more attention to this.
13238,"I get frequent shortness of breath, light headedness, and fatigue from a genetic issue, and I’m like, you do NOT want this problem."
13239,It's a very infectious virus that can spread far and wide if left unchecked.
13240,You are ok for 1.5 million more Americans dying from Covid-19?
13241,That's with 0.6%.
13242,0.8% will add 600 thousands more.
13243,"Its different, not better or worse in a clear and meaningful way."
13244,We focused on social distancing instead of masks and suffered about the same as everyone else in both COVID deaths and economy.
13245,Maybe we’ll see a difference in retrospect in a few years but claiming either win or loss is way too early.
13246,"I don’t believe we should be held as an example for the US though, as our respective populations are way too different in mentality."
13247,Around May probably
13248,Ha.

13269,"To understand that, you have to care about other people and yourself being able to access necessary health care."

13308,When were reaching the vaccination threshhold that we start putting this into place to throw off the brakes they'll likely have some kind of plan to fly citizens of vaccinated countries that are stranded in places without vaccine access back home
13309,Number 5 should include young people with comorbities like heart disease or obesity.
13310,There will be a transition period.

13398,Choosing to not take this particular vaccine when you're in an age group that has a 99.6% recovery rate if exposed is antivax?
13399,This is why no one takes that term seriously anymore.
13400,Just an random idea but would it be possible for these people to go to another state to get it?
13401,Like if the state is one of the last and they really want it then could they go to one that had it and get vaccinated?

13457,Someone who is vaccinated isn't infectious.
13458,Your statement assumes that contracting the virus is the same as being vaccinated which is factually incorrect.
13459,A vaccine can be distributed amongst a huge population over a short period of time.

13492,"For example, in Finland alone, 90% of their new narcolepsy cases (150+ people) in a single year had taken the vaccine."
13493,"I have a PhD which dealt with HIV transmission, so I have a good understanding of risk."
13494,"I know the risk is probably very small, virtually zero."
13495,But right now the risks are not fully known.
13496,So people should have a right to refuse to take the vaccine until they feel more confident in its side effects.
13497,Yeah that’s a good point.
13498,We don’t want to rely on Covid for immunity.
13499,"I just meant that if, say, 50% of SD has already had Covid recently, in theory you only need vaccines to get that last 20% covered."
13500,In the very short term—obviously you want them all vaccinated as soon as we can.
13501,I agree with your point as a point in time argument.
13502,"Like right now, how should we distribute the vaccine?"
13503,But by the time you set up distribution logistics the severity of surges could change.
13504,Population by contrast is relatively stable.
13505,I also think the vaccine takes ~6 weeks to be effective (2 doses + 2 weeks after the last dose?)
13506,so it doesn’t sound as viable as a “stop the spread” measure.
13507,I like proportional because it’s easy to make it fair.
13508,"Severity of virus spread can be subjective—is it based on current cases, percent of population, rate of cases, rate of deaths, etc."
13509,"Unfortunately we also have to consider the potential for that metric to be exploited politically (e.g., people lobbying for a certain definition of severe to get doses sooner)."
13510,"Population data is relatively static and available and there’s little chance someone could argue, say, that ND suddenly has a bigger population than TX."
13511,Slowly ripping the band-aid off got us to where we are today.

13534,Loving this.
13535,Thanx so much.
13536,Will share because I know so many people who are miss informed and think they know the truth.
13537,"Great site, but you need to put more emphasis on the main page and in your FAQs that people who receive the mRNA vaccine might experience flu-like symptoms and truly severe aches and pains."
13538,"Right now, the information there reads off like the symptoms are barely a problem."
13539,"It was just emphasized yesterday or the day before on CNN, for example, that some recipients had a lot of pain and that doctors need to prepare to explain this to patients because the fear is that some people who have no idea about these symptoms might not go back for second injection if they suddenly feel very sick after receiving the first one."
13540,"Additionally, you might want to point out somewhere that mRNA vaccines are designed primarily at this point to prevent severe symptoms that can result in death."
13541,They do not necessarily prevent infection or the spread of infection.
13542,There was also a good link yesterday on here to a financial subreddit that delved into more the problems with the technology.
13543,"You also don't link to enough sources, including peer-reviewed sources and hard data ones."
13544,"Lastly, it wouldn't hurt to provide a definition of anti-vaxxer and then also explain the difference between a critical thinker and an anti-vaxxer."
13545,Far too many people clump critical thinkers who take vaccines and believe in them but want to wait to see what happens with anti-vaxxers who hate all vaccines and will never take them.

13547,Thank you.
13548,I'll edit mine to say that as well.
13549,Covid is driving the record numbers obviously.
13550,No other issue has suddenly spiked more than before.
13551,I get your pedantric point but if nothing else is driving record hospitalizations it's almost certainly a covid record pushing it higher because nothing else is increasing it.

13558,"If you find the second part applies to you at all, now you have a potential reason why."
13559,The reference that I linked in a previous comment is one that the CDC seems to trust insofar as it is cited on their website.
13560,It illustrate the thinking behind the CDC's decision.
13561,The data used in the paper came from China.
13562,the CDC's reference was sufficient for me to illustrate the thinking inside the CDC and to point out the gamble they are taking with their decision.
13563,"There are, of course, other papers dealing with the most studied virus in human history (it left HIV coughing in the dust months ago)."
13564,Different researchers **will** come up with different numbers.
13565,I believe that I have seen the 27 day number mentioned somewhere though it an outlier amongst all the papers published.
13566,"Here, for instance, is [one](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7014672/) from early in the year that mentions incubation periods gleaned from a number of different methods."
13567,One of the numbers cited is 24 days with a 95% confidence level (two standard deviations).
13568,"everything in biology is statistical, and acceptable work *always* mentions the confidence level, the chance that it be wrong."
13569,The dust has settled at least somewhat over the past months and there are more accurate papers coming out of the huge enterprise.
13570,All that being said there will almost automatically be cases found that incubate the disease for longer than 14 days (even after accounting for the possibility that these may represent a second and forgotten exposure after the remembered earlier exposure that 'set the clock'.
13571,The point of this is that these outliers will hopefully be uncommon enough that they don't affect the CDC's calculations (guesses actually) as to the hoped-for gain in compliance from lowering the quarantine period.
13572,They will be less relevant than the period from 10 to 14 days is.
13573,Let's all hope that their gamble will pay off.
13574,"We live 20 minutes from my parents, and my husband and I are going over there tomorrow."

13594,"I’m not sure if you realize this, but telling people who physically work all day, in some cases very demanding jobs like warehouse work or retail that they cannot visit friends or family while you have your cushy WFH job and expect them to deliver all your food for you, they they should go in their apartment and have no social contact with friends or family, and no physical intimacy, while you can do so because you have your WFH job, is incredibly out of touch."
13595,"It’s also ignoring mental health, and psychological needs and treating people like robots, it’s also a form of classism, and in some cases, rural/urban division."
13596,Are you talking about 2000-3000 daily deaths from COVID?
13597,It’s rather total number of deaths including other reasons.
13598,"or not traveling, but meeting up with people outside the household/bubble."
13599,People who totally wear masks all the time and don't take covidy risks.
13600,I blame Trump and Fox News.
13601,My dad was a Democrat before Trump and before he married his latest wife who only watches Fox News.
13602,This should be the norm going forward every flu and cold season.
13603,You not feeling well?

13616,"It’s for me and my roommate, lol."
13617,We wanted some semblance of normality.
13618,"I know I’m probably just being optimistic though, and most people are having gatherings."
13619,There are accounts of people literally dying in the hospital insisting it's not COVID because it's a hoax.
13620,18 year olds havent been able to be financially independent for a decade or more now.
13621,Make it 25.
13622,"The goal was to flatten the curve, not eliminate the virus."
13623,The economy must be saved at all costs apparently.
13624,The goal in flattening the curve was to make sure the hospitals didn't overflow and greatly increase the death rate.
13625,It worked in some places would have worked better if people followed the advice.

13633,I live in northern Virginia.
13634,"I've commented on a variety of other posts that we've been under a mask mandate since March 1st, and that only once in the 8 to 9 months since that mandate went into effect have I seen a person in a place of business without a mask."
13635,"This whole area, regardless of politics, has really been observant of good pandemic protocol."
13636,"However, sitting here on the day before Thanksgiving, I can tell you there are a ton of out-of-state plates in our local shopping center, and the shopping center itself is absolutely jammed."
13637,Traffic on the roads is jammed.
13638,"Even though people are observing good protocols presumably, we've got a lot of out-of-staters now spreading this s*** in my community."
13639,We are having Thanksgiving dinner with my parents on their deck.
13640,"it's going to be warm enough for us to do that, and that's the only reason we are getting together."
13641,I don't get what people don't get.
13642,I do not think that is universally true.

13648,This is hardly a “white man’s disease.”
13649,I’ve driven from Colorado to Texas.

13658,I won't be surprised if they recommend a booster in Fall of 2021 along with the initial shot in the spring.
13659,Which of course is fine since you're probably (hopefully) getting a flu shot then anyway.
13660,I think that helps to put into words why I disagree with the above statement.
13661,"If course its damaging, but the scale, depth, and impact are different."

13664,"So if you follow all those requirements for driving which help keep people stay safe, why can't you wear a piece of cloth?"
13665,&gt;They are EXCLUDING that data and attempting to analyze only at the arms that followed the original protocol.
13666,Then they are pulling the phase 2 data that also followed the same protocol in an attempt to gain more subjects.
13667,"If all these decisions were made before any data was seen, that would be one thing."
13668,When decisions are made on the fly it appears questionable.
13669,"Realistically, from my standpoint."
13670,I think the inclusion of phase 2 data is the most problematic.
13671,That IMO should NEVER be included.

13721,It’s not a 100% guarantee or anything.

13723,&gt;What started as a Midwestern surge has grown into coast-to-coast disaster.
13724,"&gt;Over the last two months, rural counties and midsize cities in the Great Plains and Upper Midwest have been the main drivers of the dizzying growth in coronavirus cases in the United States."
13725,"&gt;But the virus appears to have entered a new phase in recent days: The reason the country is continuing to break case records has less to do with North Dakota and Wisconsin than it does with swift resurgences of the virus in cities like Baltimore, Los Angeles, Miami and Phoenix and with first-time spikes in smaller cities away from the nation’s middle, like Cumberland, Md."
13726,"&gt;”Our people are tired,” said Maggie Hansen, the chief nursing executive at Memorial Healthcare System in South Florida."
13727,"“They’re tired and they don’t see an end in sight.”

&gt;Coronavirus cases are emerging in their highest numbers of the pandemic, with more than 175,000 a day, on average, in a country that has seen more cases and more deaths than anywhere else in the world."
13728,"More than 1.2 million cases have been identified in the United States in the last week alone, and the country is on pace to reach 13 million known cases in the coming days."
13729,"Deaths are also rising fast, with more than 2,200 announced nationwide on Tuesday, the most on a single day since early May."
13730,Especially low in anti-vaxer kids because they die of stupid shit we've cured 40 years ago instead.
13731,Show me where the COVID addressed you inappropriately on the doll
13732,"Yeah I hear ya, but should the pedophile cult leader really talk?"
13733,"Fair, but keep in mind several things:
- The one vaccine that had any link created up to 7 cases
- That was one version of that vaccine."
13734,"Other H1N1 vaccines had no issues
- There are many, many vaccines given out that have zero issues
- This vaccine is not the same as that one H1N1 vaccine, and is RNA based (the H1N1 one was inactive)

Thus, the chance of this happening to you is almost zero."
13735,"Please evaluate the risk of avoiding all vaccinations due to any potential risk because there is almost no chance you will even get a serious side effect, and the risk of getting the diseases are thousands of times more risky."
13736,"It is like my 6th Grade teacher that refused to wear a seatbelt in the car, because it may cut him if he is in a car accident."
13737,"Yes, it is possible."
13738,"However, false negatives are more common than false positives."
13739,Odds are you will test negative.
13740,All of these tests only have emergency use authorization from the FDA because of COVID so there is still some variability in the results unfortunately.

13745,This isn't a surprise to anyone who understands.
13746,This seems to be the most plausible explanation.
13747,The author's assumption seems to be Oxford/Astra may be hiding something by not providing the results of a single large-scale study and not revealing any details pertaining to their other studies.
13748,It could very well be the case that they don't yet have enough data from a single study and will reveal more information to regulatory authorities regarding all studies in their submissions.
13749,"I doubt they would jeopardize the integrity of the industry on a vaccine being sold at-cost by cherry picking data, not to mention the difficulty of achieving approval if it appeared they were cherry picking."
13750,I suspect they have enough information from their studies to statistically conclude that the vaccine is simply safe and more than 50% effective.
13751,"Their method of reaching that conclusion may be unconventional, but so is the virus it is intended to address."
13752,Him and Rubio.
13753,Interesting.
13754,And obviously the vaccine isn't therapy for those already sick and hospitalized.
13755,"Having worked in the unit during the first wave, there was a point where I agree with you, their lives were out of our hands."
13756,"Not in a spiritual way, just nothing we did helped."
13757,Incredibly frustrating.
13758,"My thought was if you could target the vaccine to communities where the virus was spreading, perhaps in combination with a lockdown, you could prevent people from getting sick at all."
13759,Relying on people to catch the virus to gain immunity is risky.
13760,"Areas where the virus wasn't rampant, if those even exist, would comparatively gain less benefit from being vaccinated immediately."
13761, I'm wondering if at this point anyone who is actually doing the correct things to protect themselves and others will continue to do so or if family gatherings will cause another percentage of people to falter.
13762,One would think that after 9 months or so the people still holding the fort down have to have the strong will to continue to do so but am not sure.
13763,I know after 6 months I saw some friends who were even more careful than us go off the deep end and they are not at wineries and holding 17 people in person events.

This County Judge already wrote the baseline of that order in October, where he orders this and that."
13819,"Abott instantly went against that order, it was removed from the website not even 24hrs later."

13833,"In 2018 they only have  3,305 TOTAL for the entire year: https://www.iihs.org/topics/fatality-statistics/detail/state-by-state  if you had 6,000 deadly crashes in a SINGLE day, there would need to be some major transit investigation because at 3,305 that was already number 1 for the entire goddamn country."

13836,"I think the recommendation is that that anyone born before 1976, or has had a high risk (needle sharing) life style should get tested."
13837,"honestly, let's compare it to the flu."
13838,"while a healthy person may (not certainly) be able to recover quickly, flu is dangerous and causes many deaths, as well as side effects like organ damage in some people."
13839,"it should be taken seriously, which is why people who are able are strongly encouraged to take the flu shot every year."
13840,"people who are sick with the flu should try to stay home and wear a mask if they can't, as the person they transmit it to might not survive even if it's not a big deal for the sick person."
13841,"an individual taking these measures to prevent the spread of flu can save lives, as could the government guaranteeing paid sick days that allow people to stay home."
13842,occasionally particular deadly strains show up or one with worse side effects (like swine flu) and then it has to be taken very seriously.
13843,"coronavirus goes beyond that and is like a mega flu that is 10 times as deadly, is highly infectious, and causes organ damage relatively more commonly."
13844,"so we should already be taking the flu much more seriously than most people do, but covid-19 is like 10 as bad as that, which is why covid-19 justifies measures that  disrupt our lives."

13853,That family member attended the event with symptoms which she thought were  just allergies.
13854,Or maybe you don’t understand - people deserve concrete evidence that actually looks at the specific risk of dining outdoors.
13855,If someone is dining outdoors with a member of his or her own family - what is the specific risk?
13856,The risk of dining with someone outside the household is obviously higher - but dining outside itself isn’t necessarily shown to cause spread.

13879,Thank you.
13880,[removed]
13881,Everytime I get my hopes up it goes to shit again.
13882,So I will keep my pessimistic view for now :D
13883,"Huh, I could’ve sworn he had symptoms last time but just read it was a false positive."
13884,Yeah I'm aware that they've been very successful and that most issues arise in the first 2 months and all of that.
13885,The fact of the matter is that we don't have long term data which is why I'm leaning more towards traditional vaccines
13886,"Haha okay, whatever you say."
13887,[removed]
13888,That's my plan as well
13889,It does worry me it could mutate to even worse because it is 2020 ugh.
13890,"No, it did change some."
13891,Retail is reduced to 25% capacity and outdoor dining banned (10-15% of cases were linked to restaurants).
13892,"This won't save us, but it should help mitigate it some, which is even more important as we're about to surge from people being stupid about the holidays."
13893,Please stop being a dick.
13894,Being against abortion doesn't hurt anyone.
13895,I'm still in the same boat about it honestly.
13896,"And just like that, a generation of high school students decided not to go into medicine."
13897,"Agreed, this is even seen by the unrest all over the world which might have a correlation with lock down fatigue."
13898,[deleted]
13899,"you are doubting correctly

EDIT its not 300million, more like a few billions, USA aint the only country pushing the vaccine onto their populace"
13900,"Yes, I can only hope the same for you someday."
13901,What the hell else would it be from?
13902,"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_centrism

Although I think that what I meant to type was /r/ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM."
13903,It also takes a long time for a statistically significant number of vaccine trial volunteers to be exposed when you are not in a pandemic situation.
13904,I do but no government on this planet should be allowed to restrict me in my rights and invade my personal choices like this
13905,On what cause of action?
13906,Lol
13907,Thanks for your reply.
13908,The H1N1 vaccine caused some people to develop narcolepsy two years after taking it.
13909,Based on this I think its very reasonable for people to not want to take the vaccine immediately.
13910,"A few people at work have family members coming from other states for the holidays, acting like this is just a completely normal year."
13911,Only family my husband and I have close by is my mom and even we aren't celebrating this year.
13912,"The three of us seem fine and my husband and I were tested about a month ago and it was negative, but that doesn't mean we don't have it now and are just asymptomatic."
13913,I'd rather skip one thanksgiving than have one of us sick or dead by Christmas.
13914,It will likely be a temporary measure until the pandemic has subsided.
13915,The post-Thanksgiving wave is going to be very painful.
13916,"CDC's promise of 20 million people vaccinated by the end of 2021 is not gonna end the pandemic in the USA, which is currently infecting 1 million **per week** and *accelerating*."
13917,I'd have been shocked if he didn't have more than that.
13918,It will be too late.
13919,The vaccine will start preventing infection in January but the wave from Thanksgiving will kill people by Christmas.
13920,[removed]
13921,"Again, thanks."
13922,I’m almost getting my hopes up that we are reaching a plateau in cases.
13923,Well and they don't just stay in their small towns right?
13924,We have a lot of movement that it just can infect one community to the next so easily.
13925,"Do as I say, not as I do."
13926,Today you learned.
13927,And it’s not paraphrasing.
13928,There are tiers to border shutdowns.
13929,More crude language trying to substitute for a non-existent argument.
13930,And the best game of the day gets postponed.
13931,"It's all about hospitalisations, which are through the roof with no sign of slowing."
13932,Thanks.
13933,That’s not too bad.
13934,Right!
13935,Until COVID it was widely accepted that airplane air circulation was conducive to spreading flu-like respiratory illnesses.
13936,"However, for some reason, &lt;cough&gt;airline industry pressure&lt;/cough&gt;, the CDC feels it is important to tell us that airplane air is safe during an aerosol borne pandemic."
13937,Interesting.
13938,"TIL no country in the world has shut their borders, by your new phrasing of the term apparently."
13939,"&gt;About 30 minutes before the flight, Hancock's account tweeted out to “avoid travel, if you can”

But he cannot!"
13940,That's always a problematic statement to make.
13941,I guess it might be true on a state/regional level but for example the Novo Mesto municipality in Southeastern Slovenia has recorded 35 deaths per 100k inhabitants in the last seven days which is certainly higher.
13942,I'm sorry I still disagree.
13943,In either case it shouldn't be occurring.
13944,You've been living in a toned-down version of that for years.
13945,I am glad you are critical of the powers that be.
13946,"I think it's a bit misguided in terms of the whole conspiracy side of it, but criticism/skepticism is good."
13947,I swear redditors will just scream 'sue him!!'
13948,At every fucking thing.
13949,The long-term tests have been around how the vaccine is developed and how that type of vaccine typically interacts with the body.
13950,"In most cases we associate risks around live vaccines, and in some cases people think with inactive ones."
13951,"Most of the ones we will get will be a variation of a RNA one (I am really simplifying it, as there are many different variations) that has been shown to be safe."
13952,"Unfortunately, vaccines are typically never studied over 50 or 75 years, so none of them can rule out any long-term effective 100%."
13953,What I can say is rushing this vaccine was not done at a risk to safety but more financially for those producing it.
13954,"Typically it takes years to naturalize the virus, know how it acts and to learn how to treat it (we knew this early on)."
13955,"Then it takes years of animal testing, to determine whether it works and whether financially we can move onto the next stage."
13956,"If that works, then the company will invest in phase 1, then 2 and then 3."
13957,"However, they don't want to spend any money on advancing if it does not work."
13958,"One thing we were able to accomplish this time around is we identified many participants right away, as many were willing to do so."
13959,Think about a HIV vaccine; Would you want to participate if you were in the placebo group?
13960,"We also had a very live and active virus, so it was easy to put people in the test environment and see if it worked better than the placebo."
13961,But the number of people surpassed that of those we typically see in a vaccine trial and the monitoring of those individuals was not rushed.
13962,"This is the same for my kids, except each room has a separate entrance to the outside and breaks are staggered so classes don't intermingle."
13963,"Even so, we are pulling them out for the first two weeks in January because we just don't trust all of the families to act responsibly over the holidays."
13964,I'm guessing the schools won't open in January anyway as we are already getting that telegraphed to us by our provincial leaders.
13965,Saying that he handled at all it is already a stretch.
13966,The guy didn't do anything worth mentioning.
13967,He played golf and watched TV more than anything.
13968,Poland has 38m people and deaths are around 400-600/day for past two weeks while USA had around 1500-2000/day while having 320m population.
13969,When we multiply 38 by 8.4 it gives population of 319m and deaths 3360-5000 deaths per day.
13970,It is not 4x death rate but still at least 2x worse than USA currently and polish government completely stopped caring and not doing enough tests to not put proper lockdown.
13971,The title is of thread is very misleading
13972,I work for a district that has gone fully virtual.
13973,It is a fairly large District (23k students).
13974,In my role with the school I'm never within six feet of anybody.
13975,I've noticed the teachers are able to distance from each other and mask-wearing is taken very seriously.
13976,My children go to a smaller rural Public School.
13977,They have been in person 5 days a week since the day after Labor Day.
13978,Locals in the town I live in marginal at best when it comes to mask-wearing in public.
13979,My oldest daughter's entire grade got sent home to quarantine after two cases in the same class.
13980,The district waited 5 days to tell us after the exposure took place.
13981,We automatically assumed that her younger sister should be quarantined as well.
13982,"Upon her first absence we were informed that it was unexcused, and if she accrues five, a truancy officer will be called."
13983,"Two different schools, handling it two completely different ways."
13984,"One school's leadership is doing the right thing, the other in my opinion, is not."
13985,This is a sign of lack of leadership at the top.
13986,Can someone post the article or an archive link please?
13987,Paywall....
13988,"Yeah, they say 3-10."
13989,Poland is most likely at least in the middle of that range because we undertest heavily.
13990,how many brain cells does it take to make an intelligent decision?
13991,"Pandemic, sick, hospital bills or party on?"
13992,"A fair share of those 43% probably would still think that the government is doing fine if it was making them eat dirt out of ""patriotism"" though."
13993,Partisan politics + propaganda is a dangerous combo.
13994,Note to self.
13995,Never visit Poland.
13996,It was a joke....
13997,Thanks for the info!
13998,"&gt;I remember in April when reddit phds told everyone Sweden would emerge the winner by the end of the year

To be fair, I also remember when experts said that there would be 85,000 deaths in Sweden."
13999,Wtf does capitalism have to do with the giant huge fucking opportunity cost of NOT simply ceasing travel and stranding loads of people and supporting those people and instead just stopping a small set of flights to/from one country therefore having to support 360 million people instead
14000,"Saving face is not exclusively Chinese, is very common across all Asian countries/cultural lol"
14001,No.
14002,Youd be doing poorly managed states a favor.
14003,How does covid manage to damage all these different organs?
14004,Do they get damaged because of low oxygen levels?
14005,Did they try telling them it's just like the common cold?
14006,"My cousin knows someone that got it real bad but everybody else that got it she said they were fine 
She left the hospital because of the virus but is still acting like it’s blown out of proportion so even this argument fails as well"
14007,and this is why i hate my country.
14008,If only the Catholic Church's point of view would have been equally enlightened on condoms.
14009,I guess maintaining control over your followers' sexual life is more important than stopping the HIV epidemic.
14010,"I very much dislike Hogan but I think I despise DeSantis, literal human garbage right there"
14011,Braun is better.
14012,"His foundation relased 2 books about ""fake pandemic"" and his interviews and videos on his Youtube channel have hunderd thousands viewers and many positive comments."
14013,MANY of whom will deny vaccination.
14014,And you cant force them
14015,That matches up to a certain cult I believe
14016,"The same could be said about your initial comment, so idk"
14017,normal close contact is about 13.4 people.
14018,3 families is stretching it a bit.

14026,How many PM's will end up retiring instead of dealing with Brexit fallout?
14027,"holy shit, NO."
14028,this scares me.
14029,"Trump destroyed our country, don’t let his influence destroy others too"
14030,What is the definition of dumb?
14031,Brainwashing and polarizing a nation then making a political issue out of a pandemic.
14032,Once again I'll say America's worst enemy is America.
14033,I don't doubt that cnbc is usually a good source for information about internal Swedish policy.
14034,But in this case they have failed you.
14035,They got 70% from combining the statistics from both of their dosing regiments.
14036,One regiment was 90% effective the other was 65% effective.
14037,So obviously once this is all done and peer reviewed they are probably going to pick the dosing regiment with the higher efficiency rating.
14038,You’d think that a country where 1/5 of the people died because of nazis would be against nazis...
14039,"They think the vaccine is part of a conspiracy theory, either to make people ill or to track them and that lockdowns are being used as a measure to force compliance with any future vaccination regime."
14040,"There are a few main reasons for this:

1."
14041,"The internet has exploded with conspiracy theories, which in and of themselves aren't unusual, but since many people are staying home due to their work being suspended, they are more likely to spend time on the internet and engage with these theories which become increasingly paranoid as like-minded users participate in an echo chamber and promote increasingly radical interpretations of what's allegedly happening."
14042,2.
14043,Cognitive overload.
14044,"At the beginning of the pandemic, fewer people's jobs and bottom lines had been impacted and they hadn't spent months being isolated from their friends and worried about the safety of their family."
14045,"As time wore on, and these concerns mounted, their constant presence began to take a toll on people's mental health and as a person directs more of their thinking to anxiety-inducing subjects, less brain power is left over to assess the situation in a rational spotlight making people more prone to cognitive errors."
14046,3.
14047,Conditioning.
14048,"People have gotten used to mass dying as a result of this virus, and as a result mew statistics aren't as powerful anymore."
14049,Remember back in March how people were shocked to hear about bodies being stored in 18-wheelers in NY because the morgues were full?
14050,"Well now, I've heard news reports of the same thing occurring in other parts of the country, like El Paso, but it's become so normalized it's not front page news anymore."
14051,* I have done nothing but teleport children for three days.

14053,What 70%?
14054,I've yet to see a single person here in QC who doesn't wear a mask in an enclosed public place.
14055,"Still, we have a lot of cases-shmases, and everything is locked down because masks don't really help much."
14056,"If masks truly worked, there would be no reason to shut businesses down."
14057,"The Moderna one can be stored in normal freezers (like the temps your freezer makes at home), not ultra cold freezers."
14058,"So this will not be a problem for most clinics, pharmacies."
14059,I'm in the us and our pediatrician is doing virtual visits.
14060,I took my son to an urgent care bc he got sent home from school with sinus problems.
14061,The urgent care wouldn't even see us.
14062,I had to wait until the next day to get an in person appt.
14063,He ended up having chest congestion.
14064,You can't hear that over a computer.
14065,And he's only 4 and is just starting to really talk.
14066,I was livid w the urgent care.
14067,He ended up missing a week of school for bad allergies
14068,nothing persuades the non-believers I am afraid

14070,"As long as you're contributing to the economy, You are safe from COVID."
14071,Just ignore the overflowing hospitals and exponential growth.
14072,"&gt;first wave of restrictions early this year when the government massively overshoot

Not to quibble, but the only reason people think governments overshot in the spring was because it worked."
14073,Its really too bad people don't understand that.
14074,This is gold!
14075,And I know several who had an awful time!
14076,(me included)
14077,Only certain american deaths are tragedies aswell like 9/11 certainly not the 260K+ from Covid
14078,You said absolutely nothing substantial in response to the crux of my comment
14079,"Look, we know vitamin D is very important to human quality of health."
14080,Its THE reason white skinned people got their light colored skin from ancient black skinned ancestors.
14081,"Vitamin D was so important that when bundled up in clothing due to migration to cold regions, the lighter skinned members if a group survived better to reproductive age because they would absorb more ultra violet light easier/quicker then darker skinned kin - giving them healthier vitamin D levels."
14082,Redo this scenario for a bunch of generations over and over and the skin color of the group paled.
14083,"So, low vitamin D is bad."
14084,No matter if it causes worse covid or not.
14085,It certainly doesn’t hurt to get one’s self up to healthy levels with either more sun on skin time or supplements.
14086,"Denmarks amazing capacity for tests already at the start of the pandemic, probably helped them an enormous amount."
14087,If only Sweden also had that laying around!
14088,There are 700+ posts in the main thread yesterday.
14089,This post could apply slightly to maybe to 1 or 2 of them if you really stretch.
14090,They're simply making up something that doesn't exist to start a circle jerk and attack restrictions.
14091,https://xkcd.com/774/
14092,I would say allowing people to walk around as disease vectors is unethical.
14093,"As a school district employee, and an immunocompromised person, I really feel for you right now."
14094,Indeed.
14095,"But if you must keep vaccination going until it is totally gone, otherwise it will come back."
14096,For globally eradicated viruses you can stop vaccination.
14097,The US is very dog eat dog.
14098,Neighbors care little to not at all about eachother so long as people can cover themselves.
14099,They routinely go six feet under.
14100," *It's longer than you think*, *Dad*!"
14101,Longer than you think!
14102,"You realize this is a pandemic, right?"
14103,Your rights end when they put everyone around you at risk of crippling illness or death.
14104,"It's not fear, it's survival."
14105,In any other era of humanity you would just get kicked out of the city or put in jail for refusing to comply with safety matters.
14106,"You might be not like it but COVID is real and has way worse of an outcome of ""within a decimal point"""
14107,"Exemptions won't work in places like nursing homes, healthcare facilities, etc."
14108,where failure to vaccinate could result in mass loss of life.
14109,"As for the rest, the employer could come up with ""accomodations""  like requiring vaccine refusers to wear PPEs and engage in extra hygiene practices."
14110,"There is a lot of ""reasonable accomodations"" an employer could implement that wouldn't be seen as punitive by the courts."
14111,"Really, if an employer wanted mandatory vaccination, they could make it so difficult to get an exemption that it wouldn't be worth it for 99.9% of employees seeking them."
14112,mhm...
14113,I was still expecting the 37-42 range.
14114,Woke-adjacent.

14117,That article is from nearly 2 weeks ago.
14118,"Fauci changes his mind all the time, as this is a constantly-shifting situation."
14119,Lately he's been saying spring 2021.
14120,"Also, he didn't even say 2022 in that article."
14121,Are you fucking kidding me?
14122,"All you need to do is hit control F and type in ""2022,"" and you'll blsee your little citation doesn't prove your point."
14123,"Thanks, I appreciate it."
14124,It happened in the 90's but I still occasionally think about it.
14125,"Everything that has transpired in the past 9 months, its about to double in the next 2..thats insane to think about."

14137,"How is this the first time I’m

14138,I read covid news hourly &amp; my family is Polish.

14148,(Although the local and state governments are just as dumb).
14149,H1N1 was handled horribly
14150,Go ahead and site your source.
14151,Do you think Fauci and the CDC were lying and that lots of evidence existed?
14152,Or some study was done in April that made them change their mind?
14153,"If so, cite the source."
14154,"No, what happened was correlation between China getting the virus under control and that they wear masks."
14155,"Of course they did tons of non-medical interventions at the same time, so this means nothing."
14156,"But the public saw that Asia controlled it and we can see they wear masks, so suddenly it became gospel that masks for the general public are very effective."
14157,"As I said, cite your source."
14158,"Vaccines do not give perfect protection, and there are some people who can't take vaccines."
14159,One person in the Pfizer vaccinated group got severe Covid.
14160,"To think the political party, left or right, can handle the situation any better with people feeling strongly on each end of the spectrum is laughable at best."
14161,The answer isn't total shutdown of the world nor should the answer be don't exercise any precautions.
14162,There should be an equilibrium point of compromise but most people are either too dense in their views or just too dumb to actually get a handle of the situation.
14163,"The Polish word would be ""teleporada"" which translates to ""telephone consultation""."
14164,"The computer program probably doesn't know that word and thought it was ""teleportada"" which is teleportation in Spanish."
14165,"I mean most countries will be almost completely back to normal by summer, vaccines are expected to be widely available by March/April."
14166,And the Olympics arent actually until late summer(July 23- August 8)
14167,Do you realize that 70% is still incredible??
14168,There has never been a vaccine developed for a Coronavirus.
14169,"You need to do some research on vaccines, yearly the flu vaccine is sometimes under 50% effective."
14170,Real or not it shows you don't understand the problem.
14171,There are facts and datapoints and then how we understand.
14172,"Your side often goes for denial or outright fantasy or, in this case, pulls random out of context facts to try and bolster an argument that you refuse to flesh out."
14173,"There are of course many people in hospitals with conditions unrelated to covid, almost certainly the majority since we're talking about EVERY other reason people might be in a hospital."
14174,"What so many people have tried to hammer into your thick skull is that severe covid patients add an enormous staffing and resource burden on hospitals that can simply be met with beds (otherwise we could just stuff them in a hotel and have housekeeping check in once a day, genius)."
14175,"Honestly, I can't be bothered to explain this any further to you because people like yourself will typically just regress back to the denial or fantasy versions of your argument or move onto to some other irrelevant ""datapoint."""

14180,Extroverts literally don’t have the discipline and mental fortitude to sit out that long and are driving cases.
14181,You’re are right as there is no way we can turn this around and sadly it’s just a matter of people realizing it’s seriousness only if it affects them personally.
14182,Come Christmas we will have a good chunk of those people affected personally as we are going to have a national crisis multiple times worse than now by years end due to what’s happening this week.
14183,Umm what are you talking about.
14184,I am personally all for restrictions to keep things from exploding.
14185,"Thanksgiving and Christmas are both cancelled, It's currently too cold in New England to really hang out outdoors for more than a few minutes and it's going to get colder, I can't have friends over, Indoor dining is discouraged, We aren't permitted to eat on premise at work."
14186,I agree we need the restrictions but pretending that things aren't wildly disrupted is absolutely ridiculous.
14187,They will claim that it's a flu with a 99.99% survival rate.

14344,I don't think a lot of public health experts anticipated an almost total absence of public health measures and now the virus is likely to be endemic in the population from here on out and has totally permeated every nook and cranny of american society.
14345,It's so widespread and the possibility of a circuit breaker lockdown is completely off the table so there's not a lot you can do.
14346,It will take some time to vaccinate everyone (and a lot of people won't take the vaccine).

14354,&gt;The U.S. case fatality rate — which is the number of people who die out of everyone diagnosed — was around 5 to 6 percent in the springtime.
14355,"That’s partly because fewer people were being tested, so fewer cases overall were being detected."
14356,But health providers were also figuring out for the first time how to treat covid-19 patients in severe respiratory distress.
14357,"&gt;Over the summer, as testing expanded and hospitals tried different drugs and procedures on patients, the case fatality rate in the United States declined to between 1.5 and 2 percent."

14371,"In about 2-3 weeks winter will set in, and the problems will be compounded, the highway will close down, the trucks that keep our stores stocked and our hospitals supplied will be stuck in Utah, Colorado,  or Nebraska."
14372,Our hospitals may vary well run out of medical supplies without some response from our governor.

14385,You seem grumpy.
14386,"This dude is agreeing with you and then *adding* to your statement that anyone who gets mad about these bans because of ""the economy"" is barking up the wrong tree"
14387,U-turn to what?
14388,We are using same methods as everyone does to mitigate the virus as much as possible.
14389,"And for some that statement means theres no reason to be more careful, and others take it as a strong reason to take it seriously"

14490,"Depending on people's natural dispositions this can cause anything from kidney failure to cytokine build up in the lungs (which is why people were dying on ventilators), or reduction in the blood/brain barrier which can lead to pyschiatric issues."
14491,"All of it stems from the bradykinin storms and the suggestion the study came up with was effectively to use beta blockers and uptake vitamin D, anything to either stifle generation of bradykinin or slow it's generation."
14492,"Likewise, the only reason kids seem to be less prone to getting the disease is due to lack of developed ACE2 receptors in their airway."
14493,"Meaning, it can still infect them -- obviously, but in many cases kids that were tested positive but were asymptomatic was due to the virus being present, but not capable of causing mayhem because it essentially had no entry point into other systems of the body."
14494,But prolonged exposure still puts them at risk.

14702,"Doesnt this mean that if you have asymptomatic Covid, that you will test positive for a whole 3 months, but only a small fraction of that will be the period whre you are actually infectious at the beginning?"

14821,**Summary of preliminary findings so far** (I was one of the 242 positive tests here!
14822,"):

Virus Watch began recruiting people in July 2020 and as of 22nd November, 20,920 households and 43,073 people across England and Wales have joined the study."
14823,"The levels of people reporting cough, fever or loss or change to sense of smell and/or taste was highest in the week commencing 21st September 2020, with the highest level of symptoms reported in children and young adults aged 0 to 17 years."
14824,"The levels of people reporting cough or fever in Virus Watch were lower for July, August, October and November 2020 compared to our prior studies on other infections conducted in 2018 and 2019."
14825,242 people over the age of 16 in Virus Watch reported a positive COVID-19 test.
14826,"Of these, 40% had close contact with other people outside the household in the 7 days prior to this test."
14827,"In the period when they were likely to be contagious (two days before onset of symptoms until the illness survey date), 67% participants over the age of 16 with a positive COVID-19 test reported having no non-household contacts with whom they spent 15+ minutes within a 2 metre distance."
14828,33% reported contact with other people.
14829,"Of the 242 positive COVID-19 cases, 17% occurred in a one-person household and 83% in multi-person households."
14830,"Of the 149 multi-person households where at least one case was reported, 70% reported a single case, while 30% reported multiple cases."

14832,"Yea, I don't get it."
14833,I honestly don't even notice.
14834,I haven't gone into a store since March.
14835,"Its really easy where I live to have everything delivered to my house but the few times I've had to do curbside pickup, I leave my mask on in the car while they're putting the stuff in the trunk to keep the store staff safe...and I where a mask on my walks because there are a good amount of people on the trails (I also veer far away from them if they don't have a mask on)."
14836,I'll be huffing up a steep incline hill and won't even notice the mask on my face.
14837,I swear some people just love to cause conflict and be completely selfish for no reason.
14838,"Also the type of people who answer polls are, shall we say, not exactly representative"
14839,"Sure, we know that the lung gets destroyed, the heart my stop, the kidneys usually are damaged, the blood barrier to the brain becomes leaky, the cells that sustain nerve cells die, but what harm could possibly come from that?"
14840,The turkey is to die for
14841,So even after a vaccine people can’t go back to normal?
14842,Its worse.
14843,You might hate what Trump does but he is very upfront about it.

14850,"&gt; If everyone had quarantined for a month then went directly to the party it would, in fact, have been impossible for them to get sick."
14851,Of course not.
14852,"There has been multiple examples in national media and academic papers of people getting sick whom were isolated, including my own brother."
14853,"It's assumed he got sick from delivery groceries, but he's immunocompromised and literally lives alone on 500 acres and hasn't seen a single person since march, he somehow got sick."
14854,Your absolutely wrong here.

14872,I’ve had my eye on thanksgiving all year and I really hope the fall out isn’t as bad as I’ve been bracing myself for.

14879,Again with the generalization.

14881,I’m back from the college and neither I nor any of my friends have done anything but sit at home.

14883,Great work.
14884,Yes!

14889,Amen to that
14890,"Here in Rochester, NY there's all sorts of stupidity happening to try and keep schools open."
14891,"Technically our district has to rapid test 20% of faculty, staff, and students, but it is opt in."
14892,"The problem with that is that the people who opt in are likely not going to be the ones testing positive, as they have been following the rules all along."
14893,Monroe county has also been trying to incorporate this testing into their stats to artificially deflate the average.
14894,"Cuomo allegedly has a plan in place to keep k-8 in person, and touts low infection rates in schools, but teachers are getting sick."
14895,There's an enormous amount of insistence that these teachers did not contract Covid in the classroom.
14896,"At a certain point, that's not going to matter if there's nobody left to teach the kids."
14897,Thanks for checking it out!
14898,Dr. serendipity rides again.
14899,It's reminiscent of the discovery of penicillin.
14900,It sometimes happens that when you hear hoof beats it really is zebras and not horses.
14901,De-authorize most plastic payment cards and people might settle down a bit.
14902,"I have no idea how to get this thru some people's heads, they just don't care about the greater good."
14903,Did I generalize “all”?
14904,And we both know wtf they do once they get to their hometowns.
14905,Sending love.
14906,My father suffered the same hepatic encephalopathy for almost a full year before he died.
14907,The last time I saw him a few weeks before he finally passed away was the single most painful day of my life.
14908,I had not seen him in a couple months (live out of state) so the decline in just that time hit me like a ton of bricks.
14909,The rapid weight loss and loss of muscle mass (he was a firefighter) combined with him having a hard time recognizing me crushed me - I had to walk away to 'get my bags' so I could gather myself.
14910,The morning my mother called (before 5 am so you know what the phone is ringing for) I didn't process it.
14911,"I made sure she was okay before we hung up, sighed, and rolled over and had the best 2 hours of sleep I had had in months."
14912,Then I woke up feeling guilty as hell for doing that.
14913,"The relief was the strongest emotion for a while, with guilt a close second."
14914,It took a while to process - weeks before I cried again.
14915,"I realized that I lost him weeks prior but was unable to begin grieving, and that the body dying seemed like a formality at that point."
14916,"My dad died before he died, at least as far as he was concerned, and I recognized that."
14917,"He couldn't be the strong, self sufficient person he always was."
14918,"With the weakness and memory loss, there were some clear moments of pain in his eyes."
14919,"He never wanted to be a burden on anyone, especially his wife of 40+ years."
14920,So don't hate yourself for thinking that is the better alternative.
14921,For him it very likely could be.
14922,You know him better than most being his child.
14923,"Feel the feelings, but don't ever be angry with yourself for feeling them"
14924,I see your point but if we have to go back into the office so the people who failed to build and maintain their own personal relationships can get their social kicks I will flip out.
14925,"Work is work, colleagues aren’t friends."
14926,I have my own rich family and social life and there’s nothing I hate more than being ‘encouraged’ to go to work social events so the people who have empty lives can feel normal for a bit.
14927,Harsh but true.
14928,As much as I hate masks that’s actually one thing I don’t mind about them.
14929,Having them mandatory means even if I forget a scarf or something I can keep my face relatively warm with a mask
14930,thank you...how do you know they're genuine?
14931,wasn't there an issue with counterfeit kn95s and not being effective?
14932,I’m not fighting with you.
14933,Just letting you know your writing is unclear and makes you come off as unnecessarily aggressive because you are using ellipses incorrectly and its doing things you dont seem to want it to do.
14934,You keep prolonging this.
14935,Take it or leave it.
14936,I see.
14937,"And you're right, that's very false."
14938,All it takes is one person who doesn't realize they got infected during travel...or seeing a friend...or going to a store.
14939,And masks don't work if you're long term in a closed space with a lot of people...who are a also taking off their masks to eat.
14940,Have they not been watching the dozens of families on the news who've infected each other and got half their relatives sick (and sometimes have killed them)?
14941,Gotta love auto correct in browsers!
14942,Thank you!
14943,"No clue, just pointing out that you can’t reasonably generalize all college students like that or vilify them for coming home."
14944,Do you have a Walgreens or cvs near you?
14945,If so look into that - it’s cost free
14946,That’s a great point - thank you!
14947,"""African or European?"""
14948,These freezers have long service lives and cost 10-15k a piece.
14949,Ford will donate them to somewhere like UMich and take the tax write off.

14954,"After a long day at the hospital, it's great seeing people gathering and not wearing masks on the way home."
14955,The general population not taking it seriously makes it much more exhausting.
14956,Yeah.
14957,"And while there could be a link, very often there might not be."
14958,No need to downvote my dude.
14959,It’s a small liberal arts school.

14969,"He should really breakdown the deaths in South Dakota, North Dakota and other small Midwest states to compare it with the ""U.S."" too."
14970,Back in March it was seen as temporary.
14971,"Your second link states:

&gt; the answer: not as safe as the airline industry would have you believe, but a lot safer than you might think."
14972,I’m directly quoting the article.
14973,"With 35 percent of Texas classified as obese, I'm sure all y'all could see through your way through the pandemic without eating and burning up their surplus fat store"
14974,And those morons will still vote for her in the next election.
14975,"Wow, I didn’t know the 13 million (myself included) Americans that caught Covid all experienced this!"
14976,"How big is your school, let’s see, compare to a public school."
14977,I am saying that a governor/mayor flaunting the rules isn't the same as a president or such not really encouraging rules to begin with.
14978,I know this sub isn't political so thats as far as I'll take it.
14979,I 100% understand this is a damaging and dangerous action taken.
14980,However it is not equal in my opinion.
14981,[removed]
14982,Remind me!
14983,6 months
14984,Are people not doing college virtually?
14985,"We've been all virtual since this started in FL... and honestly it should stay an option, I prefer virtual"
14986,As much as I want to be judgy about things like this...
14987,"I always have a sniffle and a sneeze, year round I’m prescribed allergy medication."
14988,Every time I cough or sneeze I attribute it to that.
14989,If I had super mild COVID I’m sure I wouldn’t be able to tell it wasn’t my normal symptoms.
14990,Then again I’m not going to any gatherings.
14991,This discussion thread highlights a very interesting difference in the discourse in Canada vs the US.
14992,"I’m in BC and we’ve been told (and have observed) the same thing as you - masks don’t do anything to stop the spread at private gatherings, which is where so much of our spread occurs."
14993,"The only way to reduce numbers is to wear masks in public while also minimizing our contacts, especially in private."
14994,I’ve found that much of the discourse in the US is about masks and masks alone.
14995,It’s interesting.
14996,"Anyways, good luck in QC."
14997,You guys have had it rough all year.
14998,This is one of the most unnecessarily joyless takes on life I've ever seen.
14999,America is a third world country with a Gucci belt.
15000,Didn't AZ figure that out for their vaccine?
15001,Don’t worry our resturant def doesn’t have 700+ reservations for thanksgiving.... there’s no pandemic going on... stay home you dumb people.
15002,Stay safe protect yourself as much as you can.
15003,"I want to be optimistic and assume that deaths and hospitalizations will peak in the next few days given the trends with cases but, you know, Thanksgiving and all."
15004,Hopefully there will be at least a reprieve for first responders in all of this.
15005,"&gt; On average, cabin air is completely refreshed 20 times per hour, compared with just 12 times per hour in an office building."
15006,That's typical airline propaganda.
15007,"The key phrase is ""on average."""
15008,"While on the ground this is usually not the case, and the pilot has to intentionally switch to ground powered ventilation."
15009,Also airflow in airplanes does not work the same way as in office spaces.
15010,Do you regularly smell your office bathroom from your cubicle?
15011,"Probably not, and that's because air return vents redirect stale air away from building occupants and are significantly separated from conditioned air registers."
15012,"In airplanes circulation is such that occupants are always in the path of inbound and outbound circulation streams, and everything from carts, to people moving around create far, far more opportunities for turbulent mixing of inbound and outbound airstreams."
15013,"Ehh, maybe it will just be, 'i heard so many other people were doing it, so i figured f*** it.'"
15014,&gt; Wouldn’t it be nice to be so blissfully ignorant.
15015,"The older I get, the more I envy ignorance."
15016,Thanks for the good discussion.
15017,You have given some good points for sure and challenged me on a lot of my positions.
15018,I wish this sub was this kind of discussion more often.
15019,(It seems to happen when I have good data that requires a good discussion instead of a surface one though) instead of the usual BS.
15020,"From a “healthcare only” perspective, I absolutely agree that it would make sense to have a large number of restrictions on the general population."
15021,I also think it would have it 2018.
15022,"My point of view always has been that there needs to be other considerations, and I think when you take these into account, disease specialists and healthcare providers viewpoints have been the forefront, and other concerns, like mental health, effects of remote learning or school age children, potential for social unrest, bio ethics(see: https://www.thehastingscenter.org/briefingbook/pandemic/) for mandatory NPI interventions have been shoved aside or put on the back burner."
15023,"This video from the BBC is all about the suppression of multidisciplinary science in favor of public health and epidemiology: https://youtu.be/Ni_CjRHBe8I 

But yeah, I think it’s been a good discussion and I appreciate the discourse instead of the typical people thinking that I don’t do my research or just assume."
15024,Thank you.
15025,not him.
15026,"But im suprised more people with ""popular"" power arent speaking up about masks or social distancing (Celebs, Artist etc)"
15027,Staying home.

15040,"Yeah, thats pretty much my entire point."
15041,I probably worded it poorly above but I know it can be a bit dicey when it comes to this sort of thing
15042,There is a big difference between US media and the rest of the world when it comes to how sanitized video are.

15163,We are in for a world of hurt regardless but very glad we have the vaccine to be distributed shortly.

15165,Tack on 13-15 million who have already contracted the virus (and who knows how many asymptomatic and unrecorded).
15166,We've got at least 50 million + Americans either immune or reasonably safe from reinfection by the end of December.
15167,Unfortunately at best we probably have 20% of people who are immune or already contracted the virus.

15275,Finding a therapist who works for you can be a bit of a crapshoot; good on you for realizing that the one you had wasn't going to work out.
15276,I am under the impression that at least some those who will work via EAPs may not be... exactly top-shelf in their skills.

15287,I would encourage you to reconsider the math from a quality of life standpoint.
15288,Let's say that you give this a try and it only sort of works; the process of going through therapy helps you find something that doesn't completely resolve your depression but makes it 50% less miserable.

15447,I have long been a fan of draconian level measures to get things under control.
15448,"No, I do not mean welding peoples’ doors shut like what happened in Wuhan."
15449,I mean mandated full shut downs of places where people congregate w/o a strict truly essential need.
15450,That means all office workers who are able to WFH must do so.
15451,A company being caught asking people to come in would be subject to massive fines: think $50k / occurrence.
15452,There could be a bounty system where offenders could be turned in and the tipster paid upon confirmation of the offense.

15457,Are you dense?
15458,It's moreso the fact that masks subconsciously communicate the idea that everyone around you is a disease vector that must be avoided.
15459,"Masks subconsciously communicate to others, ""Please don't interact with me."""
15460,I have no trouble communicating with people who wear masks the same way I have no trouble talking to grocery store employees or my coworkers.
15461,But that doesn't mean they're remotely conducive toward a healthy social life.
15462,Holy hell I wish people would just acknowledge that masks are more than just a little piece of cloth that covers your filthy disease hole.
15463,"They have real drawbacks, and no matter how many times you say, ""It's just a mask, bro,"" that doesn't change the reality."

15466,"Curious what other supplements you recommend, as I use some of the ones you mention already?"

15468,Getting enough sleep and staying well hydrated are good ideas.
15469,"People push extremes, but may workplaces were already shifting to combined remote and on-site reporting schedules before COVID."
15470,This will only accelerate that trend.
15471,People who did 5 days/week in the office will do 1-3.
15472,Some will stay full time.
15473,Some will be almost fully remote.
15474,Shared offices and workspaces are going to become more common.
15475,It won’t be a return to before or a complete 180.
15476,The answer is somewhere between the two.
15477,"Once you're showing symptoms it's too late, you've already spread it."
15478,You're worse than an anti-vaxer.
15479,I’m technically ignoring the “not gather with people outside your house” since I live alone.
15480,"I’m going to see my parents for dinner, but that’s no different than any other week since I go there for dinner all the time."
15481,We just consider ourselves the same household.
15482,So if I was surveyed I would say I am following the guidelines.
15483,I imagine a lot of the people that answered this are in similar situations.
15484,Did you read that on facebook?
15485,Do you realize that you are exactly like an anti-vaxer?
15486,"Worse even because there is tiny miniscule risk of adverse effects to a vaccine, zero adverse effects to a mask."
15487,What are you talking about?
15488,Airlines aren’t shut down and *never* were.
15489,Depends on the person.
15490,There are people who love to work from home everyday and others that want to be in office.
15491,"Personally, I'd love something like a 3/2 or 2/3 split."
15492,"Also, for those that live in a populated metro area that have long commutes in heavy traffic working from home might be preferable over socialization in the office."
15493,Long congested commutes daily are soul drainers.
15494,Both Moderna and AZ's trial protocols mention periodic blood tests for asymptomatic infections.
15495,Well they probably don't think about you because you're not interacting with 500 strangers everyday.
15496,"Sorry, but reading through this one particular passage stood out:

""Even with vaccines that prevent disease, social distancing guidelines will remain in-tact, he explains."
15497,"Even if people are protected, they may still be able to spread the virus to someone else without ever getting sick themselves."
15498,"“The recommendation that will be ongoing is that even vaccinated people have to maintain social distancing and mask-wearing, which will make a lot of people grumpy,” Schaffner says""

....so the goal posts are moving again?"
15499,The vaccines aren't going to be enough?
15500,Why shouldn't I kill myself if that's the case?
15501,Basically everyone I know is traveling.
15502,"No, about 42% less, but thats in the current social distancing environment."
15503,When restrictions lift and more people get asymptomatic infections and come into contact that goes up.
15504,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03141-3
15505,It seems like it would be a good idea to offer vaccines to the employees and their families.
15506,"The employees will be healthy, less stressed because their family will be healthy, and it will begin to help the community get on their feet, which will make the local economy healthy."
15507,"Win, win, win."
15508,We’re doing the same.
15509,Duck seemed like an adventurous alternative.

15514,"You're definitely right, for whatever reason they decided not to work on that information yet (I suspect because asymptomatic infections were quite high)"
15515,"It may just be my sheltered upbringing, but I have yet to encounter a situation in which I actively needed brass knuckles."
15516,"To me, at this point, it seems to be an EXTREMELY small minority who is actually following this."
15517,"Every single one of my friends and acquaintances is having at least a couple of people over for Thanksgiving or traveling themselves, and most are having a full fledged normal celebration."
15518,Even the ones who have been respectably careful up to this point.
15519,This is one of those times where I question my own sanity.
15520,"My small family gets together for Thanksgiving every year too, but we all decided to sacrifice it this  year."
15521,"It didn't even take more than a minute of discussion, it was a super obvious ""yeah let's just take one year off that, duh""."
15522,"It just does not feel like a big deal to not celebrate Thanksgiving for one single year in my whole life, for the benefit of saving someone from getting sick and/or dying."
15523,But we're LITERALLY the only ones I know who did that.
15524,My mind is blown.
15525,What?!
15526,It’s not just Americans?
15527,/s
15528,As somebody who had covid I think about it like I just took the Pfizer vaccine.
15529,It seems you have a 93% chance of developing immunity to covid which is close to taking that vaccine.
15530,"Honestly, it seems like considering he tested positive for antibodies, he’s part of that 93% and might be fine."
15531,I live normally and wear a mask pretty much everywhere but have relaxed a bit on social distancing (i.e.
15532,I feel more relaxed at gym and stuff).
15533,Just my two cents.
15534,"To my knowledge the odds of him still spreading it fall within that 93%, if he got it again he most likely would have a mild case (and then capsule spread it) but considering the antibodies are still there he should be solid."
15535,"I’d worry more about him setting a bad example though, but that’s a whole different discussion."

15541,"China is winning because they are smart and have leaders that take decisive action immediately, here it's an ongoing joke and hoax to 45% of the nation."
15542,They also succeeded in spreading this Propaganda nationwide to school district administrative staff and are holding federal funding hostage for those that close schools.
15543,The issue is systemic.
15544,"So you're worried about companies wanting people to go back to office jobs in point one, then worrying about companies shrugging and just hiring remote workers in point two."
15545,"You're just worrying for the sake of worrying, apparently."
15546,"But to calm your nerves, some things to think about:

1."
15547,"Less people buying lunch, coffee, etc, is more a product of fewer people even having jobs and disposable income."
15548,"And for those who have transitioned to a temporary work from home situation, the novelty of being able to eat at home is still just that...novel."
15549,"Very few people actually *enjoy* eating three meals a day at home, and as time goes on, WFH people will absolutely start pining for off-site lunchbreaks."
15550,2.
15551,"Time zones still exist, and are a major hassle when it comes to communication."
15552,"Most businesses would rather have everyone within the same three hour time zone gap of the continental United States than deal with one part of their team being in Europe, another in the US, another in Asia....it creates a 24 hour work schedule, which very few people actually *want* to deal with."
15553,A trend to working from home is not the harbinger of doom that you're worrying about.
15554,"In Ecuador, they knew there was a problem, when bodies were left in the streets or burned in fields."
15555,In your face.
15556,The “optics” of mass burials are exactly what we need right now.
15557,"And refrigerated morgue trucks should ne painted red with big block letters that say: Keep back: Mobile Morgue Vehicle, COVID -19."
15558,Park them on every corner.
15559,The conspiracy theorists are children.
15560,"If they don’t SEE the dead and dying, then it can’t  be happening."
15561,Society’s mistake is to indulge them.
15562,"Does any of that hard, cold logic and reasoning sound like it’ll track in his mind?"
15563,I'm a healthcare worker and I hate to say this but we are still woefully unprepared.
15564,"We don't have the staff, we don't have the supplies, and we for sure don't have the infrastructure."
15565,"By that I mean we lack enough negative pressure hospital rooms, enough negative pressure equipped operating rooms for emergencies, enough housekeeping staff to clean and turn around those rooms, or adequate facilities for staff to change in and out of our work clothes, let alone don and doff protective equipment in a proper way."
15566,My patients get a 2 hour rapid turn around test.
15567,If I need testing I will have to get in line for hours and then wait days for results.
15568,"Lots of gallows humor at my work, the charge nurses are putting up a brave face publicly but in private will tell you we are all fucked."
15569,We had an incident at my work that exposed literally dozens of staff (neither the first nor the last) and there will be zero follow up.
15570,The expectation is that we show up and work and make do with whatever staff and supplies we have unless or until we are too sick to come in.
15571,At which point we are on our own to get testing and treatment....
15572,Leaving them out of the process simply due to the fact that they messed up sets up a dangerous precedent that would allow the federal government to completely sidestep local and state governments.
15573,Unless they are lawfully removed from office it would make more sense to respect the will of the people and include their elected representatives in the process.
15574,Just send in federal employees to supervise and make sure they are handling the situation correctly.
15575,[deleted]
15576,This is a misinterpretation of our current knowns.
15577,"Symptom severity is very positively correlated with viral shedding, we know that much."
15578,This implies that asymptomatic infections tend to pass the infection on less than those who will eventually develop symptoms.
15579,"This implication is obviously difficult to prove, but check this Nature article out [https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03141-3](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03141-3)."
15580,"Truly asymptomatic cases were 42% less likely to spread the disease, with another meta-study suggesting the risk of spread from asymptomatic people is up to 1/4 (!)"
15581,the risk of presymptomatic or symptomatic spread.
15582,"[Chinese studies on their cases](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19802-w) also suggest as much, with none of the 1174 close contacts of asymptomatic infections becoming infected themselves."
15583,"At the very least, we know that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines make 90% of the people with the vaccine only develop, at worst, an asymptomatic infection (and I think it quite likely that a substantial number of people gain sterilizing immunity with that efficacy rate)."
15584,"Thus, given the information above, you should see a reduction in R0."
15585,"There is only 1 person who is responsible for turning this thing political and thank God, we have less than 2 more months of his BS."
15586,&gt; Police say Tusing also had a razor blade in his pocket.
15587,He didn't pull out the other weapon.
15588,You're right it'd be unethical to do that.
15589,Participants are usually selected because on some level they're public facing.
15590,They're told to go about their business with the recommended level of precautions including masking and distancing.
15591,"Pfizer had made an effort to include participants with some of what you're talking about, yes."
15592,It's why we know it works on the elderly.
15593,Well imo as experience is gained I’d always prefer the advice of after the experience has been gained rather than before.
15594,Also I heard a lot of it being about supply + making sure it got to the people who really needed it.
15595,Regardless I think most agree it wasn’t handled ideally.
15596,Thanks for the civil discussion !
15597,:)
15598,Yeah.
15599,Our only out to look forward to is vaccines.
15600,And a bunch of these same nitwits won't get them.

15602,You can piss his people off and they'll forget by 2024 and still support you.
15603,You can't piss off the rest of America and expect the same.
15604,Edited to remove all references to politics because apparently you can't discuss the people responsible for the current state of the pandemic on the pandemic subreddit.
15605,"It's not humanitarian crisis, it's stupid human crisis."
15606,"Oh, I actually misunderstood, I apologize."
15607,"I thought you were completely underplaying the Covid cases in Poland, but I think I see your point."
15608,"I think you mean that the Covid deaths are high in Poland, but are also exaggerated by hospitals, is that right?"
15609,"&gt; The first outbreaks of the virus would have spread around the world even without the mutation, believe most researchers, including Dr. Engelthaler."
15610,"The original variant spotted in Wuhan, China, in late 2019 was already highly contagious, he said."
15611,But the mutation appears to have made the pandemic spread further and faster than it would have without it.
15612,I wonder if this is why so many agencies seemed a little thrown off in March?
15613,"Ignoring politics and bureaucracy and regular agency foot dragging, I'm curious if the initial data out of Wuhan had them anticipating a virus that acted a certain way at a certain speed and then they were caught off guard when it started moving so differently?"
15614,Sort of like a baseball player expecting a curveball and getting a fastball.
15615,"Regardless, it's important to recognize that if this thesis is correct we're potentially dealing with a trickier virus now than in March, when it seemed hard enough to contain."
15616,That's not terribly reassuring; I only hope containment difficulties are offset by a virus that's less injurious to those who contract it.
15617,"Or it could force governor's and mayor's to actually enforce mask use, social distancing."
15618,I say they should do it.
15619,"They aren't appreciated, and if people don't want to listen, let them not be able to be treated."
15620,I don't think it needs to get that far though.
15621,"If doctors and nurses told governor's you got one week to enforce mask mandates, close indoor dining, bars, gyms, or we walk."
15622,Let the governor's explain to the people why there's no one at the hospitals to treat the sick.

But of course daily death counts always look like they're trending down due to lag."
15626," 

Paywall:

&gt;Even as news of highly-effective vaccines nearing emergency federal approval offers new hope in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, intensive care units of South Florida’s largest hospital systems are seeing a familiar and grim pattern emerge."
15627,"Following weeks of rising COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations heading into fall, the ICUs at Miami-area hospitals say they now have increasing numbers of patients with severe disease and those needing to be intubated so they can breathe."
15628,"Medical experts fear that, as in previous surges, the number of deaths from the pandemic will rise as well in coming weeks."
15629,"Across Miami-Dade County, the number of patients in ICUS rose sharply over the last several days, from 125 on Saturday to 158 as of Tuesday morning — about 25% of the 658 Covid-positive hospital patients in total as of that day."
15630,"Dr. David De La Zerda, a critical care physician and medical director of Jackson Memorial Hospital’s intensive care unit in Miami, said he had been expecting the increase in the number of critically ill patients after weeks of rising case numbers that have now reached an average of about 2,000 cases per day."
15631,"As he has done since the spring, De La Zerda pleaded with South Floridians to take the virus seriously."
15632,"The lag between when cases spike and when hospitalizations start to surge, he said, can often lull the public into a false sense of security."
15633,"“You see all these positive cases and think maybe I can relax because the virus is changing,” he said, ”but it’s not changing.”  
The latest wave of severely ill COVID patients at Jackson is coming on top of ICUs that are already filled with patients brought in for other reasons, such as delayed surgeries and other medical care postponed due to the pandemic, De La Zerda added."
15634,"Though Florida’s fall resurgence of the virus has trailed behind other states with spiking cases, such as those in the Midwest, recent weeks have brought accelerated virus growth in Florida as well."
15635,"“Now everybody is here, so we have a full ICU of non-COVID and now we have a full ICUs of COVID,” De La Zerda said “And I think that’s different from the first time, when people just weren’t going to the hospital.”  
Mary Jo Trepka, an epidemiologist and professor at Florida International University, said last week that she expected the number of patients in Miami’s intensive care units to rise soon."
15636,"On Wednesday, when that expectation had materialized, Trepka said that Miami-Dade’s epidemic trajectory was “sadly very predictable” — rising cases are followed by rising hospitalizations, followed by rising levels of patients in intensive care and finally, tragically, by rising deaths."
15637,The infectious disease expert wasn’t predicting that things would get better with the virus any time soon.
15638,"“It’s not that we’ve reached the peak — we’re still surging,” Trepka said."
15639,"“I fear we’re going to be well over 2,000 \[cases\] a day in the coming weeks, and then the hospitals are really going to start to get full and get very stretched.”  
MORE OF THE SAME AT MIAMI HOSPITALS  
Dr. Yvonne Johnson, chief medical officer at South Miami Hospital, part of Baptist Health South Florida, said her goal for the past couple of weeks has been to brace herself for the next several months until vaccines arrive for the general public, perhaps as early as next spring."
15640,"“That is a bright light at the end of a dark tunnel,” Johnson said."
15641,"“But we still have some of that tunnel to get through, so it really is incumbent upon all of us to do everything we can to get safely through that tunnel until the vaccine is widely available.”  
Johnson said that the outcomes of those who end up in the intensive care units at Baptist Health hospitals haven’t shifted much since the summer surge, though physicians and nurses have gotten better at treating the disease."
15642,"“For some people, they’re there for weeks in intensive care and I’d say the majority of our patients walk back out the front door, but we have seen a significant amount of mortality over the course of this pandemic,” Johnson said."
15643,"Like Jackson’s De La Zerda, Johnson agreed that little has changed as far as how many people who are admitted with COVID-19 become severely ill and the known risk groups: those who are older and have other medical conditions, for example, and then there are others who are young and seemingly healthy before they contract the virus."
15644,"Physicians and nurses have learned how to manage respiratory care for people struggling to breathe, but there’s still no treatment specifically for COVID-19, and little known about the effectiveness of broad-range antivirals like remdesivir."
15645,"Johnson called it a “steep learning curve.”  
“We have absolutely gained a greater understanding of treating the disease, but I can’t say that we have any kind of miracle type treatment available to us right now,” she said."
15646,“The best therapy right now is prevention.
15647,It’s not getting it.”
15648,... as well as putting some more eyes on an issue and a country that gets no exposure due to a incompetent government that tries to hide its failures and despite crushing world records in daily death by population.

15901,Hospitals mostly get paid on a fee-for-service model.
15902,The incentive is for them to provide unnecessary care so they can bill for it rather than underproviding care.

Counter-intuitively, society would actually be better off if people started dying sooner due to COVID."

&gt;Health care costs for smokers at a given age are as much as 40 percent  higher than those for nonsmokers, but in a population in which no one  smoked the costs would be 7 percent higher among men and 4 percent  higher among women than the costs in the current mixed population of  smokers and nonsmokers."

15983,I feel like you have to already be radicalized to end up in places like that.
15984,I could be very wrong but people don't become Nazis overnight.
15985,It's a steady shift over time.
15986,Yep.
15987,Thought it was going to be an Amber alert.
15988,A little disconcerting.
15989,Me.
15990,"If I could safely go to a big party with everyone, I'd go."

15995,What country have you been living in?
15996,"That helps clear things up, thanks!"
15997,"He's worse than that, he actively supports the culling of Americans over the age of 65 or with preexisting conditions and publicly promotes that viewpoint to others."
15998,In a wartime situation we would easily see him for a traitor.
15999,"Most people just follow the rules even if they disagree, but damn some people are stubborn."

16007,Good for you.

16009,Why wouldn't you?
16010,No issues to it right?
16011,One reason to get a vaccine is to protect yourself.
16012,"Another reason is to contribute to herd immunity,  because if everyone has the attitude of ""I don't need the vaccine since other people are getting it"", then we don't get herd immunity."
16013,Some people medically can't get vaccines and have to rely on herd immunity.
16014,"The way you talk sounds a whole lot like antivax arguments that it shouldn't matter what they do since as long as you get the vaccine, you're protected."
16015,That's why you're getting flak.
16016,It's usually the beginning of a disingenuous antivax argument.
16017,"Out of 10 people I've recently spoken to about their plans,  I'm the only one not going anywhere."
16018,"Sure, they are keeping guest list small,  but they are all meeting with people outside of their home."
16019,"Some have said, ""we're not doing anything big,  just getting together with xyz""."
16020,"Umm, that's still getting together with people that have had contact with others and they have no idea of how careful they've been."
16021,"But whatever,  I'm staying home."
16022,I'm not going to be that accidental asymptomatic spreader.
16023,Well no use talking to him or complaining...let your vote send that special message because it's obvious he don't care about you!

16025,Wonder if he'll be wearing a mask in jail
16026,dude same.
16027,i'm either going into education or child psychology and we've seen all year how difficult it is to get anything done with kids through a screen.
16028,"That's the exact problem though, imo."
16029,"I feel like pushing people to platforms like Parler and Stormfront only pushes them into a place where there's no longer anyone around to present an opposing perspective, and in fact they're surrounded by everyone else who was pushed off of the mainstream sites."
16030,"So while the ""average"" internet citizen ends up seeing less misinformation, those who end up wandering over to other sites end up being radicalized much easier."
16031,"Frankly I have no idea what to do about this because I do agree it's important to combat flat-out misinformation - but it is still important to consider what happens to those who end up outside the ideological norms, and how to prevent them from necessarily falling down a tailor-made radicalization pipeline."
16032,"I think we need to find ways to encourage people to be more critical of their media diet, but honestly who knows how that'll happen."
16033,Lol Greeks and following the school rules.
16034,You are really underestimating the body size of the grad students too.
16035,"FYI a lot of the big schools allow freshmen to live off campus this school year, so they are given a choice."
16036,"Does anyone know how long after they started vaccinating people with Pandemrix they started noticing people getting narcolepsy, back in 2009 when H1N1 was the big thing?"
16037,"I should probably add that I'm up do date on all my vaccinations, that I plan on getting one for COVID when I can and that I understand the reward far outweighs the risk."
16038,I'm just curious.
16039,You should watch the most recent This Week in Virology.
16040,They have Crotty on and he explains most of what his team found and says that it's corresponding with many of the preprints he's privy to in other studies.
16041,He said there is more B-Cells at 6 months.
16042,"Interesting stuff, it starts at about 1 hour in

16044,I can tell you burnout is real.
16045,Per capita the US isn't winning yet - they're a measly #11 among major countries by death rate per capita.
16046,"Rules for thee, but not for me."
16047,"In reality, every person who makes an argument that there's no need to alter our lives is now justified by the actions of these hypocrites."
16048,This mayor should be recalled if such a mechanism is available to Denverites.
16049,"The less money you spend on the patients, the more money you keep."
16050,Think about it.
16051,"Like if I give you $500 a month as a foster parent and I make it clear that money is for the kid's food but I'm not monitoring it all that closely, I just need to show the kid is not malnourished."
16052,Are you going to spend all $500 on food or will you find the cheapest foods you can find to keep the kid fed and then pocket the difference?
16053,"If you wouldn't, you're a good person."
16054,But not good people will be tempted to do that.
16055,"As for the McDonald's example, their incentive is to use the cheapest ingredients that the customers will tolerate."
16056,"Since they're not the only burger place out there, they're free to do so and, if the customers think they've cheaped out too much, they can vote with their feet."
16057,That's how the market is supposed to work.
16058,"Since we don't really have a choice with health care, it's not really a free market."
16059,"If I'm having a heart attack, I can't shop around to find the best hospital."
16060,I'm stuck with wherever I'm going.
16061,"Just to be clear because it's easy to conflate....

Insurance companies want to collect premiums and deny claims."
16062,"The less they pay out, the more they keep."
16063,Hospitals want to charge as much as possible for the work they do and give you as little as they can for the money.
16064,That's the for-profit system at work here.
16065,"It's also unethical to force people to wear clothes, but it's perfectly ethical to require that they put clothes on if they want to enter your private property or government buildings."
16066,People who don't want to get vaccinated can simply get work-from-home jobs and never travel or go to public events or stores.
16067,Confirmation bias.
16068,"They want it to be ""just the flu"", so they filter out everything that doesn't support that conclusion."
16069,Yes.
16070,"Yeah, that totally justifies dropping atom bombs on children."

16072,"It was after school
Around 3:30."
16073,I’m telling you what I saw.
16074,Doesn’t really matter if you believe me or not.
16075,I was appalled by what I saw.
16076,I’m not easily appalled.
16077,I also have great vision.
16078,Fauci really thinks that there’s a significant amount of Americans that are capable of the sacrifices necessary to do positively effect the virus.
16079,Fuckin this is our WW2 moment and there’s a non-insignificant number of people that would rather roll over and let Japan run amok in the South Pacific
16080,The... what?
16081,Are you suggesting the totalitarian Japanese government was so afraid of totalitarianism they surrendered to the US because the Soviets were taking their conquered territories off them?
16082,"Remember, the only threat to the Japanese mainland was the USA."
16083,The Soviets had no real ability to invade Japan proper.
16084,The truth is the nukes were most of the reason Japan surrendered when they did.
16085,I still say SquareSoft instead of Square Enix.

16088,"*Time zones still exist, and are a major hassle when it comes to communication*

The US has 500 million to choose from who live in the same time zone but earn less (Mexico, Central and South America)."

16101,"Considering that politicians are still people, and people constantly delude themselves into thinking that X wont happen to them."
16102,Yes I do think I can reasonably apply it to politicians.
16103,this is common knowledge.
16104,Yeah good thing the Americans were aware of this secret discussion to maybe perhaps think about possibly surrendering.
16105,Meanwhile then Japanese were openly stating they would fight to the bitter end and teaching children in school how to fashion make shift spears to fight to the death with.
16106,But yeah.
16107,It’s so obvious they were going to peacefully surrender any minute.
16108,Your right to get covid-19 and spread it to other people is not a right anyone is going to be concerned with.
16109,"Meanwhile our Governor in Washington is doing all he can and 40% of the state hates him for it enough to vote for a Republican candidate with literally no experience, didn't graduate high school, and who couldn't even be bothered to fill out the voter guide information."
16110,Might be good to add the numbers for the normal rates.
16111,Numbers in isolation aren't really useful.
16112,300k+ thousand excess deaths of Americans and you want even more and yet you see yourself as some kind of patriot.

16114,People like you would definitely have been collaborators during world war ii had you been born in Europe.
16115,"It's not the leadership, they don't have enough authority to keep people inside, which is the one  single thing needed  to end this pandemic."
16116,"This is caused by enough Americans not caring enough, or  caring more about protesting/rioting than keeping  people safe."

16132,Too many of the people that should be above reproach have been bastardized during this administration.
16133,There are valid reasons to be concerned with the scientists that have to report through the current US administration.
16134,"That said, I'll take a vaccine if any reputable group of scientists says it's safe."
16135,I will not take a vaccine or any treatment if Trump says to...I might need to figure out how to inject sunlight if I did

16201,63% is absolutely worth it for anyone.

16203,"Even if we only vaccinate 2/3 of a population, a 63% vaccine adds 40+ percent to whatever was the natural and acquired immunity level, getting us right up to that 60 something percent herd immunity level."

16210,"4 years after vaccination, they found that 61 cases of narcolepsy could be tied to H1N1 vaccines (56 for Pandemrix specifically)."
16211,40 of those were children and teenagers.
16212,"The mean time for symptoms of narcolepsy to appear was 4.7 months for adults (2 days to 2.5 years), 3.9 months for children and teenagers (15 days to 1.3 years)."
16213,"To put this into perspective, that’s 56 cases out of 4.1 million Pandemrix inoculations."

16238,It's not an earned benefit because an 18 year old who falls and breaks his or her neck could get SSI despite paying in nothing or very little (just their job for a few Summers at Taco Bell) could get SSI for life.

16252,That may be true but the same pattern that we have seen in other countries appear also in Sweden.

16269,"Parts of the suburbs are yellow, parts are orange."
16270,It's based on area code.

16272,"Basically if that area code goes orange, schools close for 4 days for deep cleaning, and then reopen to test."
16273,"If the infection rate is lower than what would be considered orange, they can remain open."
16274,It's unclear how often they'll have to test upon reopening.

16289,When the most vulnerable population get vaccinated there will be a sharp drop in deaths.
16290,That group account for a huge majority of deaths.
16291,Then as others get vaccinated it will decrease people who get ill as well because those will have in some cases 95 percent protection base on moderna and pfizer.
16292,We should still wear masks for a while and practice some level of safety protocols.
16293,Sorry for that long lecture of a reply!
16294,"Lol, it seems like people that had COVID can still get the vaccine."
16295,It is unclear how long antibodies remain in the system and whether they provide any immunity to reinfection.
16296,"I’m sure that people who already had COVID and have those antibodies will be less of a priority group for the vaccine than people who’ve never had it, but it looks like people who have had COVID shouldn’t think they’re in the clear and don’t need the vaccine."
16297,lol i dont think YOU do
16298,This answer has nothing to do with the question
16299,Because as one person pointed out its not 100% effective.
16300,But also more importantly if not enough people get vaccinated it could still end up possibly overwhelming our hospitals and making hospitals much busier than they need to be.
16301,The whole aim of getting the majority vaccinated is that it takes alot of pressure of our hospitals

16332,I want to get checked out but I’m not sure how much of it is going to be dismissed to having COVID in the past.
16333,There is no right wing media really.
16334,Maybe there are some fringe things or even religion influenced sources but for the most part i do not hear anti-mask talk from any sources.

16350,"Thanks, and you're welcome."
16351,We'll eliminate easily over the summer.
16352,It will be expensive.
16353,Remember that masks are like 40% efficacy.
16354,A vaccine is 90%.

16365,"I don't think Japan is particularly slow to change, it's just that the West is really, really fast to change and has a tendency to automatically think ""change good, not change bad"", and so overcompensate by throwing all the rules out the window and rewriting them when the slightest hint of a problem comes up (either that, or coming up with problems when none exist)."

16371,To be perfectly honest I think a lot of people online are exaggerating long covid or in denial about the psychological basis for their symptoms.

16373,"Dr. Rushworth does not deny the existence of several chronic illnesses, just the ones that are obviously nonsense like probably a good portion of these so-called long haulers."

16387,"People have been smoking cigarettes on public sidewalks, throwing the butts all over and no one bats an eye."
16388,I don’t think it’s as rare and Reddit and other online circles make it seem.
16389,We see an extremely skewed example here because we talk about the bad ones every day.
16390,"There are likely thousands of companies (mid/small size) doing the right thing, but they do it quietly because it’s the right thing to do and no one reports on companies who aren’t on the Fortune 500."
16391,I've been plotting the data for my state.
16392,My observation is 14 days lags too much.
16393,"The state government here focuses on 14 days average, but I think that is about the length of time from exposure to symptoms, not how well it fits the data."
16394,7 days tracks the raw numbers pretty well and takes out weekend effects and little day to day variations.
16395,"14 days smooths more of course, but 7 days isn't that noisy,  so 7 day moving average seems best."
16396,"the tragedy

16406,What is a vaccine made of?
16407,Does it?
16408,Or is it just extra media scrutiny and that more people have COVID?
16409,The Japanese were not interested in a treaty.
16410,That’s fairly well documented.
16411,The options were land invasion or blockade the island until starvation forced their hand.
16412,"Both other options would have led to
far more deaths than the nukes did."
16413,No option was good.
16414,The nukes were a case of shock and awe to force a surrender and it almost didn’t work as the Japanese still weren’t going to surrender and almost didn’t.
16415,There’s nuance to the situation that goes far beyond “talk it out”.
16416,"So, help me out here."
16417,"We know there are different COVID strains, even ones so different that they would defeat a vaccine (i.e."
16418,the strain that has come from minks).
16419,"Given how contagious COVID is, wouldn't a rollout of a vaccine just allow the other strains to artificially ""win"" the evolutionary race and just immediately become the most prevalent strain?"
16420,"Wow, what an absolutely terrifying comment."
16421,"This article states covid COULD be stopped, its not even a certainty.... so your thinking then turns to throwing people in jail if there is even a chance that could make a difference."
16422,"What is with redditors wanting some fantasy draconian war-time mindset world where they get to be smug while jerking off to an idea of ""bad citizens"" getting hauled off by the army while they were good citizens following the rules."
16423,The real world is where people have a wide variety of beliefs and ideas about what is right and what isn't and there will be many that disagree and people will die as a result of other peoples actions.
16424,This has and always will be the case.
16425,I will never support a society where we start saying some groups of people just deserved to be punished and treated like prisoners... because we all know where that goes.
16426,I'm sorry you have that much hatred for other humans and I would give you a hug in real life if I could.

16555,This seems to be the keystone in the debate.

16584,"Any day can be your last yall, regardless of the pandemic"
16585,"I HATE that people keep saying ""jab"" for vaccine now."
16586,Where did this slang come from?
16587,It is like nails on a chalkboard for me.
16588,"Is it to avoid saying ""shot""?"
16589,I have never before heard it in my life and all the sudden it is everywhere.
16590,"I didnt say it was the solution, I said it because people here seem to over value the effectiveness of wearing masks."
16591,I think our country (NL) has found a nice balance between relative freedom versus keeping the pressure on the healthcare low to moderate.
16592,For some reason out government has installed a mandatory mask policy beginning december 1.
16593,I dont think that will help anything at all.
16594,"Look at germany, belgium for example, and if you see HOW people are wearing masks..."
16595,"Yesterday on local news: ""Hartsfield-Jackson is requiring masks and has redesigned parts of the airport for social distancing, but they are estimating that one million travelers will pass through the airport this Thanksgiving."""
16596,"Airport managerial-level employee: ""Yeah, we're doing our best to make it safe, but people still want to travel."""
16597,"Me: ""... no one's making you unlock the airport doors, you complicit fuckers."""
16598,People just do not understand the word NOVEL.
16599,Sigh.
16600,I worked paying medical bills for a large hmo for years.
16601,I know too much for someone who doesn't actually treat patients.
16602,"At first I was meh because we already heard about MERS, SARS, Swine Flu, ect.. We never had the explosion we expected claims wise."
16603,Then my PhD science buddy gave me a call Feb 29th and gave me a clue... ok chief!
16604,Got it.
16605,"I didn't leave the house for month's, I got groceries delivered, ECT."
16606,"God bless my daughter for taking that chance, and we made masks and I had gloves from my gig at a tea shop."
16607,"I'm still all about the masks, sanitizer and staying away from people."
16608,I'm not the one in this house who has c.o.p.d and is 74.
16609,"But it's NOVEL so, why take a chance."
16610,"Yup, commented on that in another chain."
16611,I’m sure if we would have asked nicely they would have given up.
16612,/s
16613,"Great news, let’s get our hospitals covid free to lower these numbers now."
16614,Good thing he’s wearing brown pants
16615,"For the first time since the coronavirus outbreak hit the United States, the country has added more than one million cases in each of the past two consecutive weeks."
16616,"Covid deaths, which lag reported cases by weeks, are also at a level not seen since the spring."
16617,"Some epidemiologists project that the number of deaths in the coming weeks could exceed the spring peak, in spite of improved treatment."
16618,"In the past week, the United States added an average of 173,000 new daily cases."
16619,"If this growth pattern holds, the total number of cases reported for the full month of November is likely to hit 4.5 million."
16620,That would be more than double the number of any previous month.
16621,"With several days still left in the month, about 3.3 million people in the United States had already tested positive for the coronavirus as of Nov. 23."
16622,[...]
16623,Kinda rude to assume that
16624,"No just bad logic on it part, others have addressed that though"
16625,I'm afraid Americans have never seen *humour*.

16629,Quit misconstruing what I said.
16630,"I never said anyone is ""joking ABOUT 2100 deaths in a single day."""
16631,"But constantly making the ""so far"" reference from the Simpsons is a joke comment."
16632,"Quit acting like you don't know what a fuck joke is, and quit act like you cant grasp nuance or parse language."
16633,Making *a* joke doesn't necessarily mean making a joke specifically *about 2100 deaths*.
16634,Learn how to read.
16635,Frickin' idiots.
16636,The waiting game.

16639,I don't know if that can be true.
16640,"Wouldn't, arithmetically, the moment that a country ""catches up"" with Swedish infections also catch up with Swedish herd immunity at the same rate?"
16641,Where's the advantage?
16642,Xmas is going to be fun.
16643,"You seem so salty riding this ""programmers"" thing."
16644,What do you do for work if I may ask?

16648,"We have ramped up as much as we can, assuming you mean the USA"
16649,They are literally signed on for the exact same vaccines the EU is signed on for pretty much.
16650,"Hence why they’ll receive their first doses at the same time as most EU countries, BUT one specific EU country (Germany) has domestic production capacity for the Pfizer vaccine so they’ll obviously get some doses before all other EU countries."
16651,Gramm**a**rly is even better.
16652,"not earlier in the year, and still there are regions that not as effected as some parts of Denmark."
16653,He should flat out decree that all anti mask idiots are going to hell.
16654,"Even after the nukes, the military high command literally invaded the imperial palace to kill him for being weak because he wanted to surrender."
16655,But yeah I’m sure we didn’t think to say “please.”
16656,Totally missed an opportunity here...turkey/gravy flavored ventilator tubes.
16657,How's it possible that one gets a mild case of anything else and someone else gets a major one?
16658,"Adding another meh - the whole ""required by the feds"" were things they *already* were doing."
16659,Screw that.
16660,Mods should have pulled their bullshit when it was called out for the first time.
16661,Now the fact that their being meeker because they're obviously full of it doesn't absolve them of the responsibility for encouraging people to spread a deadly disease.
16662,"Just throwing out there that plasma, and antiviral therapy in general, is best used early in the infection course, as the damage and problems that lead to hospitalisation is usually caused during the height of infection and once these people are in the hospital it's not the virus that is the problem, but the damage caused combined with overactive immune responses."
16663,Ford has stepped their game up insanely of being a help to this pandemic so their intentions are in the right place.
16664,They’ve been building shields mask and ventilators so I can see them making sure their employees have vaccines and they become a distribution center.
16665,I know my plant has our own medical area that’s staffed with nurses and doctors (they’re all assholes there) but I’m sure other big 3 plants have their own facilities as well.
16666,I hope my company does this too.
16667,I’m pregnant and can’t get a vaccine right now so nice it’s available and anyone around me that will get it the better!
16668,There's literally studied showing that our widespread mask use is making people more susceptible to other transmittable illnesses like the seasonal flu.
16669,Your logic and basis in reality are unwelcome in this sub.
16670,"It's full of people who only want to view this trough a very specific lense, and all of them are deeply uncomfortable with talking about what really happened."
16671,"They don't want to solve problems, they just want to beat people with internet hammers."
16672,I 100% agree with you.
16673,"We never had a collapse in NYC, the entire basis of this thread is false and misleading."
16674,"Ah, so this whole situation is a dry cut case without nuance that can be discussed, maybe it isn't possible for two different nations with different holiday periods and travel culture to be affected by the virus differently?"
16675,"and your point about Sweden getting more people returning from Pakistan etc could be true, I mean Sweden didn't ship off those immigrants to an island used for nuclear testing and isolate them or anything."
16676,Good.
16677,"A lot of things I disagree with desantis on, but he's handled covid masterfully"
16678,China?
16679,Ya.
16680,*surprised Pikachu face*
16681,And there is no 20% herd immunity threshold for a virus with an R0 of 5.
16682,The model is simply wrong.
16683,I don't need to entertain it.
16684,"But we see this trend outside of the US too, where healthcare is generally free to all."
16685,"Government:

THANKSGIVING BAD

BLACK FRIDAY DOORBUSTERS AND CROWDS GOOD"
16686,Did you read my post?
16687,If your comment was addressing my post it doesn't seem to make sense.
16688,How could I have made my post without what you're saying as a given assumption?
16689,"And yet we regulate smoking in public, too."
16690,Because there is no ventilation in places.
16691,Disingenuous to like.
16692,"Second hand smoke, which takes months or years to build up damage and you CAN move away from with an airborne virus that needs one chance."
16693,Just.
16694,One
16695,I just thought to the same thing.
16696,Thanksgiving is the ramp up to the launch off in December.
16697,What a great way to celebrate the New Years.

16699,"Yeah, I have POTS and I've basically mitigated it with exercise and medication."
16700,Although the idea that COVID could make it come back is now terrifying me!
16701,That sounds like me and I never had it!
16702,Pure nonsense.
16703,Plus it’s still the same temp indoors.
16704,"Oh fuck off, you didn’t even read them."
16705,"Yep, it is sad how familiar you can became  with an acronym, when it barges in your life..."

16709,It's like using condoms consistently.

16711,"Then boom, pregnant (or an STD)."
16712,Its a Rad Trad.
16713,they live in a separate world from us

16716,Bosses
16717,What about those without phones?
16718,[removed]
16719,Yes.
16720,Scientists have determined this already.
16721,Here's a good summary in link #1 below.
16722,60% of the patients they looked at in Italy had myocarditis.
16723,That is wild.
16724,Link #2 confirms this occurs in those not hospitalised or even asmyptomatic.
16725,It's usually up to 10% in hospitalized flu patients.
16726,"See Link #3.

From this hard evidence of non respiratory involvement we know that covid19 is far more dangerous than the flu and is far more likely to affect other systems via inflammation."
16728,Wrt memory loss I couldn't find numbers on flu memory issues but it's around 30% for Covid19 hospitalized patients.
16729,That is ridiculously high.
16730,People need to be on notice that when somebody is known to have SARS-COV-2 that they are to be LEFT ALONE.
16731,"House arrest in their bedroom, all food and beverage is brought to their door step."
16732,Door closed at all times.
16733,Only leave the room to quickly grab the food and maybe to use the bathroom.

16735,"Its already at that awful death level in some European countries: Today's death numbers in US equivalent numbers: Bulgaria, a stunning 7,504(157 actual), Belgium 5,124(183 actual), Poland 5,864(674 actual), Italy yesterday 4,691(853 actual0"

16738,"very interesting, as that was my first thought reading this."
16739,time to research.
16740,lol.
16741,K
16742,"The people that don’t want to believe the hospitals are full and the US is at a crisis stage isn’t going to believe it, it doesn’t matter the evidence."
16743,I work with a guy who has said all along it will go away after the election.
16744,"Now that it hasn’t, he’s decided all these photos of body bags and sick people are crisis actors being paid to fake."
16745,"I would like to say once it hits them or their family, they will change their mind, but evidence says they deny its real as they’re dying or waking up after 30 days on a vent and blaming the nurses and doctors for making them unwilling participants in the hoax."
16746,Do you think there any other negatives of millions getting a virus other than dying?
16747,Lol stay home then
16748,"I do think they were all tested weekly so any asymptomatics would have been caught but agree on all other points, this needs to be repeated in a planned manner on all age groups etc."
16749,I'll give you that.
16750,"It's nowhere near as bad as the doom and gloomers would want us to think, but we are worse off than DeSantis makes it out to be."
16751,No need for a lock down.
16752,Keep limited capacity in tourist areas and encourage businesses to enforce mask wearing where needed.
16753,I never expected it would be the Swedes to run this strategy and I hope in the end they'll be just as fine and it won't make much of a difference in the long run.
16754,Anti vaxxers and anti maskers walk hand in hand.
16755,Thanks Wakefield.

16761,"Lol, what a reach."
16762,&gt;Precisely what I also thought.
16763,"&gt;Tegnell saying that they are allowing some spread is not proof of a herd immunity strategy

Ok"
16764,The lockdown forever crew is in shambles trying to justify staying home through 2022.
16765,I've seen a bunch say they would rather stay isolated than take the rushed vaccine.
16766,Sorry guys old normal awaits in May weather you're ready or not.
16767,Every employee gets two free weeks of paid sick leave as part of the Cares Act.
16768,This is paid for in full by Uncle Sam.
16769,"The employee stays home, and Uncle Sam writes the employer a check."
16770,No employer is going to turn down free money from Uncle Sam just because they feel a moral obligation to super spread Corona as much as possible.
16771,Either the employees or the employers aren't getting full communication of all of the rules.
16772,There's no reason for any person with symptoms to breaking quarantine until they can clear a positive test.
16773,"I don't know about them, but I'll take a paid vacation to sit home and watch TV and order delivery to save lives."
16774,The issue is how fast COVID spreads.
16775,"Even with a 1% case mortality rate, spread across the entire US is 1.5 - 3 million dead."
16776,"Worst of all, hospitals will go down hard."
16777,The USA did leave Hirohito at least nominally in power.
16778,We literally accepted a term of their surrender.
16779,So clearly there was an option besides unconditional surrender.
16780,Site not vailable in Europe
16781,Didn't you know?
16782,If you get covid you have like a 30% - 80% chance of having *lifelong* health problems!!!
16783,/s
16784,"On the contradictory, the pandemic revealed our most selfish, distrustful part inside, and this is probably more scary than the virus itself."
16785,We all know this for long but we will all fall into this prisoner's dilemma every time.
16786,I work.
16787,This is when I shop.
16788,"You can combat that take as well, but it's harder."
16789,"I present it as, ""Hospitals have a need to render aid."
16790,We don't let old or sick people die because they were old or sick.
16791,"So, 100,000 old and sick people have to be in the hospital."
16792,Now those hospitals can't treat young and previously healthy people.
16793,"I mean, look at this article: they had to put car crash victims on the floor on sheets because the COVID patients had all the beds."
16794,"3 of these people died because there were so many sick people, and they didn't even have it!"
16795,"When the hospitals collapse under old sick people, the young, healthy people can't get the treatments they need to go to work and keep the economy running."
16796,And a lot of young healthy people depend on old people to provide their child care.
16797,"If grandma and grandpa can't watch the kids, mom and dad can't go to work, and then the economy tanks anyway."
16798,"These small and local businesses are taking a hit, so let's see what we can do."
16799,Let's use what we have and fight back.
16800,(You often have to phrase it as fighting back and doing something with all that tension and coiled up simmering rage.)
16801,"That bakery you like so much, why don't we make a couple calls and see if they need some help setting up a Facebook page or looking for grants to stay open."""
16802,Some people are actually willing to let thousands of people die.
16803,Those people you can't dissect and you can't get through to.
16804,"Others are just struggling with an enemy they can't fight in a traditional way, and if you give them an outlet, you can reason with them, but you have to put their anger somewhere else first."
16805,Please explain the belief that makes it so hard to put a piece of cloth on your face to save lives.
16806,And this is being copied by millions of people across the country this week.
16807,December is truly going to be a horror show.
16808,"&gt; The existing paper form is cheap, it works and it is an international standard."
16809,I havent seen it.
16810,Is it photo ID?
16811,"It's just that if you are going to be using the thing every day to get into work or use public transport, there are different requirement than something you only pull out once in a blue moon."
16812,You do not have the fortitude to do what is right for your country.
16813,"You are mildly inconvenienced, and can’t handle it."
16814,"If you can’t follow mandates, you stay home."
16815,"Yes, a month from the first vaccination is generally considered to be needed for the immune response to reach its maximum."
16816,"Doses are repeated to reduce the fraction of people not responding, to strengthen the immune responses, and to extend the duration of protection."
16817,"If you get exposed before, chances of protection are lower, but not zero."
16818,That’s basically where you’re heading.
16819,"Only instead of your dead body it may be that of your family members and loved ones, the poor cashier who checks your entitled self out and the old lady who had the misfortune to cross your mouth breathing path."
16820,"You are a coward hiding behind a twisted platitude to pretend your not acting like a selfish, entitled, ignorant child."
16821,"No, and this whole thing hasn’t been along party lines from the start, unless of course you believe that colleges and the trendy bar scene are strongholds of right."
16822,Employers should make getting the vaccine mandatory they should make sure that the employee has paid time off to get the shots.
16823,They should make it mandatory to wear a mask until medical professionals say it ok not to wear a mask.
16824,"US states ranked by per capita 7-day deaths (check out the Dakotas):

[https://www.statmap.org/deltastates.html](https://www.statmap.org/deltastates.html)

And states ranked by total per capita deaths:

16825,Paywall
16826,"Yes, it's a private company, they can chose what requirements they want you to have to travel."
16827,Right now you already need some vaccines to travel to different countries.
16828,A population of workers is constantly overlooked..direct support professionals.
16829,"We lost 14 individuals in our agency, many who lived in group homes."
16830,Other agencies were hit 2-3x as hard as us.
16831,"And since those individuals aren’t going anywhere (program was closed at the time), it had to be the DSP’s bringing it into the home, which is super sad to think about."
16832,I really hope they consider them when distributing the vaccine.
16833,"&gt; it caused a lot of cognitive and memory loss issues

Did psychedelics cause cognitive issues or was it other drugs?"
16834,"I'm sure you're right in that Fox won't be damaged too much, but I'm wondering if the network will end up giving in and moving further right, or if they'll hold onto the few scruples they seemingly have."
16835,"Honestly, to me, this is one of the most interesting things to happen to Fox in ages, considering their persistent lying is old hat by now..."
16836,"I can't say much about the Netherlands, except that I know you guys were balls-out this summer (but it seems you still are since you're imposing mandatory masks indoors only next month) and that looking at your number of tests I can't really be confident of your case numbers."
16837,You have half the tests per 1M inhabitants of countries like Spain or Germany.
16838,"So of course, if you don't test, you don't get lots of confirmed cases."
16839,"But you don't seem to have many deaths, why, I don't know... is it the bikes?"
16840,Is it because you're not counting people with co-morbidities?
16841,Or is it because you're good at protecting the old?
16842,No clue.
16843,"The truth is other countries have a lot more deaths and each time they relax in order to help the economy, they get hit over the head."
16844,Applying something that works in Sweden to Spain is all nice and good as long as you're realistic about it.
16845,"Sweden has a different hospital system than Spain, another population density as well."
16846,"I for one think it is stupid to wear a mask always outside, like they impose in Spain."
16847,"It's even counter productive: people will prefer staying home, going to a bar, seeing their friends and family indoors where it really is dangerous."
16848,So you can have a policy that seems good on paper but it's awful in practice.
16849,"On the other hand, indoors or in a crowd: masks!"
16850,"I don't care about your ""freedom"", put it on, on your nose at well."
16851,I'm unwilling to spend the year indoors like some people here would like just so that some 80 year old can get to live another year and die of the flu next season.
16852,But I'm also more than willing to change a lot of stuff in my life so that this is prevented.
16853,"In any case, I'm a germophobe: I've been washing my hands and coughing in my elbow for decades!"
16854,"I just wish everybody did it, with or without corona."
16855,you can’t be this dense.
16856,there’s the threat of someone coming over and spreading it to them.
16857,Exactly.
16858,I'm going to start going through recipes and enjoy myself.
16859,Ah ... now it’s clear.
16860,Thanks so much!
16861,"Yeah but MMR, DTaP, and polio have eradication status locally, in the US at least, due to vaccination programs."
16862,So they do work.
16863,Do what I did a few years back.
16864,Keep a record of the stuff you love and hate about your current employer and make sure its included in your next contract.
16865,If your position is in demand and the company is in a pinch they'll sign almost anything that doesn't severely conflict with them.
16866,Saved my ass twice over the past 8 years when they implemented new employment rules and procedures and my original contract superceded them.
16867,If they want me to relinquish those benefits they have to buy out the contract.
16868,Then they will claim they have no idea how they caught the virus.
16869,They always wear a mask at the store.
16870,"My local hospital is using COVID as a shield to cut retirement benefits and health benefits starting January 1, basically stating we know you can’t strike, the hospital is too full."
16871,"The nurses tried to strike and people were literally driving up on the sidewalks trying to hit them, throwing garbage at them and calling them murderers."
16872,"Literally all social media was attacking the nurses, not the hospital."
16873,"Even the news was basically like, they’ve got four floors full of COVID patients and these nurses want benefits?"
16874,"Wow, aren’t they pieces of shit."
16875,They eventually gave up because literally no one was on their side.
16876,So now their community hates them and their benefits are still getting slashed.
16877,"US yesterday 2,194 deaths a new high, but here are this morning's daily death reports from Europe in US equivalent numbers: Bulgaria 7,504, Belgium 5,124,  Poland 5,854, Hungary 3,636, Croatia 4,519, Austria 3,303, Romania 2,889"
16878,"Thank you, that makes it clearer."
16879,So because theyre hesitant of exacerbating the death toll they should stop complaining?
16880,Lol what?
16881,&gt; People have already done their personal risk assessment about this virus.
16882,No.
16883,"People have decided what they want to do, *and then* cherry picked the news to justify why they are being smart and safe."
16884,"Since their decisions are not based on data in the first place, it is unlikely that new data will change their minds."
16885,Just like you need to carry your driver's license and credit card.
16886,There is no reason for it to be an app.
16887,"The existing paper form is cheap, it works and it is an international standard."
16888,And Colorado is in better shape than many other states.
16889,"Here's their latest case/death charts, with running averages:

16934,even 1% is ugly and the greater issue is the 20% or so who persevere thru the infection with severe side effects going forward
16935,&gt; I don't mind keeping a mask on if I have to go out most of next year.
16936,Its not a big deal.
16937,This is honestly the most mind boggling thing about this whole situation to me.
16938,Wearing a mask is just... not a big deal.
16939,At all.
16940,Its such a small convenience and yet people fight as if they are literal slaves for having to wear one.
16941,"Then you are in luck, it looks like the trials started in August."
16942,You deserve neither freedom nor safety.
16943,"You’d be a collaborator, don’t forget the red band around your arm."

16945,Over my dead body.
16946,Google translator ;) They have written teleconsultation so remote consultation.
16947,"Yeah, that's how we are having medical care in Poland right now."
16948,"Next time someone tells you that you can't fight fate, ask them why they aren't a coal miner or a slave or a serf or indentured servant."
16949,At one point throughout history that was pretty much everyone's fate... until some of them fought it.
16950,It’s been out of my control for months.
16951,My brother in law is a huge anti-masker and also does a lot of work involving construction and maintenance.
16952,He could contract the virus at any time and I’m not planning to wear a mask constantly at home.
16953,I’ve long since acknowledged that contracting COVID is out of my control.
16954,The only thing I can do is to avoid giving it to others.
16955,I’d say it definitely brings an air of normalization to being against other vaccines.
16956,Lol
16957,"Hey, not all of us are this delusional."
16958,"We have many people who hate him and his whole party, but we definitely have way too many people worshipping him, sadly..."

16968,LOL.
16969,Regurgitating American propaganda is not history.

Very interesting indeed."
16971,Not really.
16972,"They are the same measures as this spring, just locally applied."
16973,The public gathering limit thing is just an application of an existing public conduct law.
16974,Closing some places is just an effect of not being able to gather there in large groups or for economic reasons.
16975,"Also, local government (kommun) have always been able to close businesses and public facilities."
16976,It was just the national government that couldn’t do that.
16977,I believe Stockholm actually closed a few places this way recently.
16978,It's a bona fide bug in the human genome.
16979,"Turning to authoritarianism in hard times makes sense in the context of small tribes in a constant state of war with their equally ""barbaric"" neighboring tribes that could try to unconditionally kill or enslave them all with no warning, and where prospects of a peaceful resolution through diplomacy are minimal."
16980,So it makes sense we evolved to respond that way as a society.
16981,"Unfortunately, in the modern world, that instinct is entirely counterproductive -- the overwhelming majority of modern societal, political and economic ills are *caused* by greedy, me-first right-wing policies, resulting in a vicious cycle where something goes to shit, and as a direct result people demand even worse leaders that fuck it up even more."
16982,"I genuinely think this ""seemingly innocuous"" trait that no one pays much attention to could, without hyperbole, be what ends up destroying humanity."

16989,"You can find the data multiple places but yeah, would be good to have included."
16990,Neither the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines had any safety issues.

17030,Interesting.
17031,Are you able to share an example of one of those provisions?
17032,I'm exactly like you stated - I never negotiate anything beyond salary and start date.
17033,Never really thought there was anything else I could negotiate for.
17034,The same people who are complaining about it being rushed and that it will cause side effects and microchips being implanted are the same folks who would never get the vaccine anyway.
17035,"And just an FYI, your 5 minute google search doesn’t equate to decades of research experience and being in a lab for months with the virus and testing the vaccines."
17036,I had a lot more free time on my hands.

17046,"Americans are so surprised by this, but the entire east asia and many south east asia countries are COVID free too like Singapore, Vietnam and where I'm from : Brunei."
17047,Re-infection by SARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed in a minute number of cases and is an area of ongoing research.
17048,The development of a universal vaccine for influenza is another one.
17049,But the two topics are not entirely related.
17050,A shorter quarantine period might improve things if it's more feasible for people to do.
17051,The problem with a 14 day quarantine is no one can take 2 weeks off their job in the US.

17066,People are have their minds made up.
17067,I can't imagine it getting much worse but here we are.
17068,I bet it wasn’t the first family gathering for this family.
17069,Just this time someone brought the virus to the party.
17070,I mean there are other factors such as sterilizing immunity vs. non-sterilizing immunity (whether the virus protects against infection vs. severe illness- which in my opinion the latter is still a great thing).
17071,But let's just say it does provide sterilizing immunity.
17072,A 5-10% chance of getting infected may be low enough for you and maybe myself.
17073,But others may feel like that's rolling the dice and when we're considering the social end to a pandemic that's important info.
17074,"I don’t think travelers suddenly get a sudden priority, even if they’re willing to pay exorbitant amounts of money."
17075,"And even if they can, the number of people who can practically afford dumping their money (probably several times more than the ticket itself) to get a vaccine early are so few and far between that it’ll be an insignificant amount."
17076,"Even if it significant, a vaccinated person is a vaccinated person, especially one that is traveling."
17077,You quite literally mitigate the chance of several thousands of future cases since each person has a potential to be a major choke point.
17078,"Combined with the fact that mandatory vaccines have been a thing for a quite a while (I can’t go to my home country from the US without a whole slew of shots), this is neither precedent setting nor radical."
17079,"What will most likely happen is people will look and be like “damn, I need to be vaccinated to go to Ibiza this summer, hmm let me register to get one at the earliest available time, if not, oh well, I won’t buy a ticket” or “I’ll go somewhere else that doesn’t need me to be vaccinated”."
17080,"Overall whether or not this actually changes who gets vaccinated is not all that critical, what matters is that people do get vaccinated."
17081,"And so far, it seems like that’ll be hard enough as is so any incentive to do so is better than none."
17082,"We can barely get people to take normal vaccines, let alone the most publicized vaccine known to man."
17083,[removed]
17084,They do.
17085,"Again, look at Australia or New Zealand as clear examples of that."
17086,Not even close to that old.
17087,You’ll be fine.
17088,Cry more.
17089,There are multiple strains of every virus.
17090,This precludes vaccine protection only if mutations are in specific locations targeted by the vaccine.
17091,We do not know yet if this is the case for SARS-CoV-2.
17092,Yikes
17093,Fingers crossed for a Lyme vaccine!
17094,The thing that is making me so crazy is that there is such a big light at the end of the tunnel now.
17095,"By most accounts, some vaccines are going to be distributed in the near future, with more becoming available to general public some time next spring."
17096,"All signs point to, warm weather + vaccines next year are going to make next year a million times better."
17097,"I'd be more empathetic if we didn't have an end in sight, but it's just this one year of holidays at this point."
17098,We are in the final stretch of this race; it's not time to celebrate quite yet.
17099,Sounds like we don’t yet know if the vaccine prevents against being a ‘carrier’ for the virus.
17100,"So until we know for sure or until everyone is vaccinated, you’d need to still be safe (mask social distance etc)"
17101,&gt;How would it be herd immunity through spread if right below it it states that they are trying to slow spread?
17102,"Do you think there is only one way of achieving ""herd immunity"" naturally?"
17103,Clearly you think that the only way to do it is to let the virus run wild and infect as many people as it can in a short period of time.
17104,"But the actual strategy was about controlling the speed of the spread so that the hospitals were not overwhelmed with cases, but still allow the spread to continue at that slower rate so that eventually herd immunity would be reached."
17105,"As Tegnell put it in the form of an analogy:

&gt; It's like with forest fires and other things, that if you can just make it burn a little slowly and carefully, you can make it burn out."
17106,"Note: he wasn't talking about putting out the fire, but instead he was talking about making it burn slowly and carefully."
17107,The goal was to achieve herd immunity without overwhelming the hospitals.
17108,"You can deny it all you want, but there is abundant evidence from early in the pandemic that herd immunity was the goal."
17109,you joined Reddit at the beginning of the pandemic.. to do what exactly?
17110,Okay so lockdowns do.... or don’t work?
17111,Because I’m getting mixed signals.
17112,Maybe that is because they never had a herd immunity policy..?
17113,"That's like accusing someone of something over and over and over that is clearly not true, and then becoming agitated for them pointing it out."

17191,Incorrect.
17192,"The poster to which you have replied is referring to the total deaths for the entire duration of the pandemic, and the number they cited is already in terms of per capita."
17193,"However, this is a poor take because the current daily death rate is the topic of conversation here."
17194,"Further, the OP seems to be saying that the current daily death rate is much greater than is being reported."

17240,Hey!

17242,We're not part of the problem.
17243,"And that ""working"" at home slur is bullshit -- because unless you live alone, trying to deal with a normal workload with your whole family on top of you isn't that much fun."

17277,This is generally the reason behind all unconditional surrender from the perspective of the loser.
17278,The hope of a negotiated settlement disappears the moment you have lost virtually all chance of inflicting meaningful losses on the enemy.
17279,Negotiated settlements are possible when you still have some level of power.

17281,"And to pre-empt you trying again to bring up American crimes, yes, no shit, but that's not what we're talking about."
17282,"Japan's hopes for a conditional surrender included avoiding punishment for war crimes, disarmament, occupation, and in general, any consequence for the war itself."
17283,It was not based out of a fear for the people - it was based out of a fear for the ruling class.
17284,"You also didn't answer my question, instead trying to weasel out from under it by asking about Japan's motivations."
17285,Why SHOULDN'T the United States have pursued the unconditional surrender of Japan?

17314,"&gt;1) lockdown
2) extensive track and trace with enforced quarantine
3) herd immunity

&gt;Tegnell says essentially ""we've chosen 3""."
17315,Because option 3 wasn't herd immunity.
17316,It was 3)allowing some spread.
17317,And none of your other quotes are proof of a herd immunity strategy.
17318,No one actually cares about the long term effects.

17325,Looking at you Congress.
17326,Very shortsighted comment.
17327,Agreed.
17328,I think we will look back to the development of these vaccines and realize what has been achieved is monumental.
17329,My point is that people need to know it's months away from MOST people being able to get it and that we need to remain vigilant until then.
17330,"We're all so desperate for good news, I just hate to think that people see a headline about the great new vaccines coming, but not understand the timing or details."
17331,Death rate in children for COVID is very low.
17332,No actually you’re wrong.
17333,I’m in favor of masks and social distancing.

17338,You can’t have a robust economy and unchecked virus.

17344,&gt;Research from the Uni­ver­si­ty of Mary­land School of Med­i­cine indi­cates that COVID-19 patients had few­er com­pli­ca­tions when they took aspirin.
17345,"As part of the study, COVID-19 patients who were giv­en aspirin ear­ly as an out­pa­tient were 43% less like­ly to be admit­ted to the inten­sive care unit (ICU), 44% less like­ly to be put on a ven­ti­la­tor and 47% less like­ly to die."
17346,"Fur­ther­more, on Novem­ber 6, the Uni­ver­si­ty of Oxford announced it will add aspirin as a poten­tial treat­ment for COVID-19 as part of a clin­i­cal trial."
17347,"The other supplements are zinc, iron and vitamin D.

Don't go nuts with iron (or the others) but iron has a much lower threshold for overdose from the appropriate dose and it's very dependent on your iron levels, you could take a very high dose when anemic but if you took the same while having a normal iron status you could quickly overload your system with iron."
17348,[deleted]
17349,I think a lot more people will become comfortable with it after they see it being administered to more and more people.
17350,I believe most people are hesitant about getting the vaccine due to it being so rushed
17351,Does a virus care?
17352,If you were a doctor would you be going to a party after work with your elderly parent?
17353,No of course not.
17354,It’s nothing to do with class privilege.
17355,I think you think there is a ‘virus privilege’ like they didn’t deserve to get infected because they were ‘careful’ and only got exposed for noble reasons.
17356,Wait what do you mean?
17357,Which measures are those?

17359,I'm curious about how the anti-vax crowd who rails on about how the state can't control their bodies feels about corporations getting equipment to vaccinate employees.

17361,I'm just curious to see what they'll say.
17362,I've checked the email.

17364,A local shop here in the UK has started selling 'catalytic fragrance lamps' which claim to be fragrance diffusers that stop COVID!
17365,The blurb on the poster is full of double talk and seems deliberately written to make you think the WHO has recommended them.
17366,Comes in a variety of 'essential oils'.
17367,Anyone got any links or science debunking this I can take to them?
17368,If I google it my results are filled with quack blog posts and Facebook spam.
17369,We can blame whoever we want.
17370,I am only congratulating Washington's governor for putting thousands of people out of work during a surge in a pandemic before the holidays.
17371,"Well done, governor!"
17372,He should know that this is **not** his fault at all.
17373,It totally was not HIS decision to do this to the people of Washington!!!
17374,"Would hate to see a progressive governor look bad, eh...."
17375,Do you have a source?
17376,I thought I remembered hearing that none of the people in the vaccine group had severe Covid
17377,lol idk
17378,"I don't disagree here, but you've drifted so far from ""Pack the stores on Black Friday!"""
17379,"at this point, that it makes your argument irrelevant to my criticism of the OP's post."
17380,Good.
17381,"Also, I live in one of the worst outbreak areas in the world, and the business here have been largely doing what you think they should be allowed to do for months."
17382,Guess what?
17383,That's exactly why things are so bad here.
17384,I'm not just arguing on theoreticals here like you are.
17385,It is PROVEN that your approach doesn't work.
17386,"Have a great day bud, it's been fun pointing out the errors in your thoughts :)"
17387,Straw man argument - no one is saying anything like that
17388,The current unemployment benefits essentially made it so that anyone making less than 22-24 per hour makes more sitting at home.
17389,"People on Reddit preach unemployment, but ar least in Michigan factories and fast food places can’t hire people because no one wants to work."
17390,"UPS is actually offering a signing bonus and 24 per hour, yet we need more stimulus."
17391,"Nothing is free, prices of goods are already jumping."
17392,"More stimulus just means inflation, which long term is worse than getting a thousand dollar check."
17393,"If I'm understanding this correctly, it could mean that the half dose makes no difference and that this vaccine just works much better in younger people."
17394,Will now be important to see the age breakdown of the infections in the normal dose group to see if this is the case.
17395,"If it actually turns out that the efficacy for people under 55 in the normal dose group was similar to the 90%, that would mean the efficacy for older people would be lower than the average of 62%.."
17396,"You definitely came to this with an axe to grind, facts be damned."
17397,"You're right, they didn't break down the numbers from studies, because apparently there haven't been many studies yet."
17398,"But they interview and quote experts in the field who are experiencing post-Covid patients, and if you want you can dive into [the paper they linked](https://alzres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13195-020-00640-3)

And the woman in her 40s was mentioned as an example of how previous viruses similar to Covid can cause cognitive impairment - that sounds like a rather relevant fact."
17399,"We don't know how common or rare these incidents are, and we don't know if they are long-term or temporary."
17400,"That's the point - there's a lot we don't know about this virus, so the risk calculation is a lot more complicated than ""If it doesn't kill you it's harmless"""
17401,for a while on this subreddit you could not post anything that wasn't positive without getting down voted into oblivion.
17402,"And then, after the election, they just disappeared."
17403,Is it a trusted source?
17404,I think it might happen over fears of another pandemic happening.
17405,"Also with antibiotic resistant bacteria increasingly becoming a problem, vaccines would be a part of the solution to deal with such a problem."
17406,The lack of data outside of isolated reports has me very skeptical.
17407,"I'm in the opinion that if it happened as often as people say, there would be at least a couple of studies saying, ""XX% of people were found to still have reduced lung capacity after recovering from mild COVID cases."""
17408,I was just reading a study the other day where the Chinese government test 10 million people in Wuhan in a couple of weeks.
17409,10 fucking million.
17410,&gt;Peet Tull says herd immunity.
17411,Not Tegnell.
17412,"No, Tull offers three options:

1) lockdown  
2) extensive track and trace with enforced quarantine  
3) herd immunity

Tegnell says essentially ""we've chosen 3""."
17413,&gt; This is a regional doctor.
17414,Not someone connected to making the Swedish strategy.
17415,Not quite...
17416,"This is an Infection Control Doctor - that is, the man responsible for implementing the strategy in his region - and his understanding of the strategy is pretty damn clear ""goal = herd immunity""."
17417,He didn't just make that up.
17418,"We know for a fact that behind the scenes Tegnell was openly talking about herd immunity, so it seems obvious that what the regional specialists were being told in private doesn't match what Tegnell has been saying in public since the backlash came."
17419,Note: In March Tegnell had no problem admitting they were pursuing a herd immunity strategy.
17420,&gt; Saying that UK seems to have a well thought strategy in early march is not proof of herd immunity strategy.
17421,That's not what he said and you know it.
17422,"He said that Sweden has the same strategy:

&gt; \- We are very similar, I would like to say, he says."
17423,"&gt;  
&gt;\- I have listened to what the British say and **they say exactly as we do in Sweden."
17424,"** 

...

&gt;  It is a much more appealing way of thinking than these violent ways that they are now trying to put an end to (with other countries)."
17425,There is a clear risk that they will only create even higher peaks (on the spread).
17426,"If you put a dam for a river, you can hold the river to a certain level, but eventually you get a huge flow for a period."
17427,**It's better to let it seep through slowly.
17428,** Then you can keep control and take care of it so that it does not have to harm your society more than necessary.
17429,"...

&gt; **In order for Sweden to achieve flock immunity, six million inhabitants would be affected by the virus."
17430,"**  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Yes, but at the same time we must remember that the vast majority will become very slightly ill. We do not know how big this so-called dark number is, but there is a lot to suggest that it is very, very big, says Anders Tegnell."
17431,"&gt;  
&gt;\- **Even if it sounds like a lot, it may be one of these 60 percent who get really sick and maybe five or six of those who need care."
17432,"If you can then smear these five-six percent in six-eight-ten-twelve months, it is manageable for healthcare."
17433,"**

In March he was talking about ""smearing"" the 6 million cases over several months - that's a herd immunity strategy."
17434,So what?
17435,They close the border down but their lockdowns don’t sync with Frances.
17436,So France has been on a steady increase while the UK decided to lift restrictions and then a flight comes in from France and then boom; another outbreak.
17437,"Unless you’re syncing your lockdowns, not gunna work."
17438,And I’ve already addressed this.
17439,Chinas lockdown was like a draconian nightmare.
17440,East Asian countries are under an entirely different system of government than western countries.
17441,"They are heavily reliant on government, and militantly enforced."
17442,There is no personal liberty and privacy vs government interference philosophy that happens is East Asia.
17443,Culture is not a monolith and political responses can not be either.
17444,They have always been catered to the public.
17445,Bad point.
17446,Next?
17447,I mean your opinion on covid probably reveals a lot more about you than just that
17448,And yet Sweden is still doing pretty well in comparison to many other European countries when it comes to deaths per capita.
17449,It's just that everyone is hit heavily right now.
17450,Sweden doesn't seem to be doing worse than countries who tried heavy lockdowns.
17451,You do know that the vaccine has a 95% efficacy rate?
17452,So you have the same chance of catching the virus as going to Harvard (1 in 20).
17453,"Also, they reduce your symptoms/make you asymptomatic, so no need to worry about Corona after vaccine."
17454,"The Vaccine was always the end goal, since the start of the pandemic."
17455,Stop fearmongering.
17456,"For SARS-CoV-1 immune responses, although this is not certain sterilizing immunity, has been shown to last up to 11 years after infection."
17457,"[0] On the other hand you have normal cold viruses which has shorter lasting immunity, challenge trials have shown 60% to be susceptible a year later, although with less severe symptoms."

17469,"""*** as the strategy."
17470,Remember?
17471,Where does it state that herd immunity was the strategy?
17472,"I can't find it in that source, all I see is a discussion around it."
17473,"I agree, we are an image based culture and it's not like the media doesnt love running fear based stories we should be seeing footage of body bags and morgue trucks to scare the shit out of people to stay home."
17474,She is but she isn’t really.
17475,That’s like saying Marco Rubio is good looking.

17477,Read the full headline
17478,Obama got you a [great economy](https://cdn.statcdn.com/Infographic/images/normal/22727.jpeg).
17479,Trump just didn't screw it up.
17480,It’s pretty rude to cheer unemployment.
17481,I think you mean the federal government lack of national subsidies.
17482,(Edited for clarity.)
17483,This is the response I was trying to get.
17484,Let’s assume those 50k didn’t have corona.
17485,Now we will have to add to that anyone who dies of something that would have been diagnosed during COVID times.
17486,"(Impossible, I know) that’s what we’re really looking at and it could very well be almost even."
17487,I’m not saying let’s stop regulations.
17488,"As I said to the other guy, I don’t necessarily agree with all my points right now."
17489,Just making people think.
17490,"&gt;Just turn off your brain

My family is vaccinated."
17491,I got my flu shot already.
17492,I am not an anti-vaxxer.
17493,This kind of messaging is fucking weird and triggering all kinds of red flags in my mind.
17494,They are NOT testing more.
17495,And their positivity rate isn't falling like it would if it was just from more testing.
17496,"But which is it:

1) Is the head of Sweden's virus response lying?"
17497,2) or is it that you know a lot more about epidemiology and Sweden's specific situation than him?
17498,"Well, that's a rhetorical question, but the obvious answer is that you are wrong, bought into a lot of propaganda, but are incapable of admitting it."
17499,"Yes I agree, but it's critical that the vaccine is 100% safe"

17510,"Wait a year, it is not a risk."
17511,"Just wait a year - and scratch that, even."
17512,"Meet after you're vaccinated and have a true celebration, a true thanksgiving."
17513,So pretty much nothing has changed..
17514,Fair enough.
17515,We simply have evidence of far more cardiac inflammation cases post-Covid and post-Covid respiratory symptoms lasting months vs the flu.

17524,"&gt;The study, from researchers at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, looks at viral load and viral shedding data – which help determine transmissibility – and found that those levels peak from around the time of the first symptoms to the fifth day after infection."
17525,"They go on to say other diseases like SARS have higher viral loads after symptom onset and this allows for people to isolate themselves, and is likely the reason why COVID has spread so quickly."
17526,Americans clearly decided saving lifes is something they don't care base how busy airports are
17527,"I mean, the analogy, on top of everything else I said, highlight my argument on when I think it was more than okay."
17528,It was the right decision.

17533,The experts said hundreds of thousands would die.
17534,The experts said we were to out of control and if we got to winter that way we’d see incredible death and widespread overwhelming of health systems.
17535,The experts said if you where masks you can contain it and keep a degree of normalcy.
17536,The experts have been right the entire time.
17537,What are you waiting for to play out?

17549,My coworker tested positive this morning.
17550,I can't get a rapid test.
17551,The fastest result I can find is 2-4 days (e.g.
17552,4 days).
17553,Half those places I called said even with nearby exposure they won't test if I don't have symptoms.
17554,One place I called said their website was wrong and it may take 10-14 days for result (so effectively pointless).
17555,The rest are telling me they cannot guarantee my insurance will cover it and will only know after they do their $1034 to $1300 procedure.
17556,Insurance company says they cannot guarantee and the health service would have to inform me.
17557,So... Getting a free drive thru test with a 7 day wait on results.
17558,Spending holiday at home.
17559,Still have to go to work on Monday if no symptoms because America.
17560,"But hey, at least I won't risk giving my mom Covid."
17561,"I had mine like 20 years ago (for a trip to Venezuela, IIRC), I got some kind of certificate or card too, but I have no idea where it is now."
17562,"I moved house several times during that interval, so who knows."
17563,"If I ever need it again, I hope taking another shot while already vaccinated is OK."
17564,Every day we have random headlines about America where no one reads the headlines and everyone just piles on their anti American comments.
17565,No different.
17566,I love how annoyed you guys get when any other country outside of America gets criticized.
17567,So cute.
17568,A bit better when looking at excess death.
17569,"But we're definitely doing shit, no question"
17570,Lawsuit material?
17571,"Time to call it quits..fuck it, I tried"
17572,Wow you are such a genius.
17573,"I didn't think of that, I should just scream at my family to wear masks in the house and to harp on them wearing masks outside when they don't want to."
17574,"I have done everything in my power to discourage large gatherings, to encourage mask wearing, yelled at my brother in law over it."

17585,*
17586,I think you are right that it is important that people do not feel shame for getting a virus.
17587,Shame is another variable that create conditions in which the virus is more likely to spread.
17588,"A person gets it, then feels shame, then doesn't tell other people that they got it or they have symptoms and they feel ashamed and hide their symptoms, etc..."
17589,This type of situation also occurred with HIV in the 80's.
17590,Removing the shame of getting that virus was a major part of the effort in slowing the spread of that virus.
17591,Thank you for this.
17592,The focus has been on masking so much that I feel we often forget that social distancing and hand washing are so much more pertinent.
17593,That is Germ Theory 101.
17594,Actually this varies by university.
17595,My university has a lot of off campus housing but my friends has more university controlled housing.
17596,"Everyone on university controlled housing (dorms, university apartments, frats/sororities) are being sent home because the university is closing down all in person campus services until next semester."
17597,If you live off campus then you can do whatever you want but a lot of people don’t
17598,Facts are no other region is even comparable to Stockholm.
17599,"It has nearly 50% of deaths, with a population that's 20% of the total"
17600,It sounds like you are disagreeing though?
17601,"I dunno, guess we'll never get to the end of it."
17602,Have a good one!
17603,"No they have a social democracy that had a bit more state involvement, a more “humanistic capitalism” if you wanna speak in silky terms."
17604,"&gt;The police incident occurred Dec. 6, 2017."
17605,Honestie had stepped out the back door of her home with her mother and another family member to go to the store when they were confronted by police officers with their guns drawn.
17606,"&gt;  
&gt;“Put your hands on top of your—,” an officer ordered them before he was interrupted by Honestie’s mother screaming, “She is 11 years old, sir!”  
&gt;  
&gt;“Stop yelling!,” the officer responded, as recorded by an officer’s body camera."
17607,He ordered Honestie to walk backward toward him with her hands up.
17608,"&gt;  
&gt;A second officer grabbed her arms, pulled them behind her back and handcuffed her."
17609,"Honestie shouted, “No, No, No!,” pleading with the officers not to place the cuffs on her."
17610,"The police, who said they had been searching for a 40-year-old woman in connection with a stabbing, removed the handcuffs after several minutes."
17611,I can't even imagine how traumatizing this must have been.
17612,"RIP, Honestie."
17613,Which makes a great argument to take the vaccine even if your not excited about Bill Gates microchips (seriously apparently people believe this shit) The possible side effects and Bill watching you is way less fucked compared to the actual lingering issues

17624,What could be more American?
17625,"Lol, rationalize it however you please."
17626,Why was a 92 year old venturing out so much?
17627,It seems like this could have been avoided...
17628,"The solution is simple: people shouldn't have to choose between potentially catching/spreading a deadly disease and starvation, therefore more government funds should be allocated to keeping businesses afloat while they're closed as well as to people in the form of more frequent stimulus checks with higher amounts of money."
17629,"Since a vaccine is close, this would be especially justified."
17630,"then that's shouldn't be called asymptomatic, as they have symptoms
(lung scaring, heart inflammation etc)"
17631,Aw someone has their panties in a twist.
17632,You stalking me now?
17633,How sad for you
17634,"I’m going to check it, thank you for the recommendation!"
17635,How capitalism reinforces itself through culture is super interesting.
17636,The whole argument about kids not getting covid is meaningless when you don't have teachers bc they won't stop out of school gatherings.
17637,Between positive teachers and the ones quarentined for exposure to that one we can't do in person school.
17638,I'm trying to get my district to focus on basic skills and develop a plan to incorporate missed curriculum into the next grade(s).
17639,K-5 may just need to repeat the year.
17640,This year is a wash and trying to force it to be normal is stressing out the kids and teachers.
17641,Students just aren't showing to to their virtual classes.
17642,Something like 25% at the high school are failing.
17643,Social desirability bias.
17644,I think it will take morgue trailers in every town to do it.
17645,Then take a different vaccine.
17646,I trust the BioNTek one as it was developed in Germany.
17647,You have a choice of several different vaccines.
17648,You can take the Putin one if you want to.
17649,My friends in the UAE got the South Korean one a while ago.
17650,So far do good.
17651,"Non medical meaning cloth masks, not N95 etc."
17652,"Not cherry picking, we aren’t told to wear N95s so any study about medical grade masks aren’t relevant as we are using cloth masks (and generally not washing them, and not trained on how to keep them sterile or fitted)

I’m not anti-mask, I think it is reasonable they have some protection in some circumstances, but also increase risk in others."
17653,Overall they have a net benefit and minimal harm.
17654,However they’ve been given this miracle status rather than a small incremental change in risk.
17655,Obvious examples like the meat packing plants (where masks are always worn) where near 100% of workers got sick in a few weeks show that lack of distancing totally overwhelms any protection masks offer.
17656,Even the Pope is done with these morons

17660,Nobody wants a media circuis for a slightly below average quarterback.
17661,Do you want to know why vaccines in a non-emergency situation can take so long?
17662,Funding and capacity of the FDA to review.
17663,"It can take years to get the funding for testing, and when the initial funding runs out, they have to jump through hoops and do it all over again, and again, this can take years."
17664,Insane amounts of money have been thrown at this so they don’t have to do that here (with the exception of Pfizer who did their own funding).
17665,The second is FDA capacity.
17666,There are finite amounts of people who have the expertise to review any particular type of drug.
17667,"Here we have dedicated teams who have reviewed data almost in real time, the moment it’s received scientists who’s only job right now begin reviewing."
17668,"Your third-party reviewers are also in place, independent review boards, often times who’s members are unknown to the FDA and manufacturer, review all data throughout the trials and at EUA review."
17669,You have to look at this logically.
17670,What gain would there be if any of the pharmaceutical companies were to release a dangerous or ineffective vaccine?
17671,Literally the entire world is watching and skepticism and questioning are already rampant.
17672,"Releasing a vaccine that could be dangerous would sink even the largest drug company - all are traded publicly, their stocks would sink like a stone and reputations would be burnt to a crisp."
17673,"Fuck this up, and the ramifications would be biblical."
17674,"The fiction we're told in the US is that because of your socialized healthcare, you needed to wait 18 months and travel over 1000km to be told you'll need to see a private firm in the US where your arm will be rebroken and set right."
17675,"Oh, and the X-ray machine is still out of order."
17676,Doesn't change the fact they should...
17677,Because I don’t truly believe hospitals overflowing.
17678,It’s merely  propaganda.

I wasn’t actually blaming Biden, I know there’s a transition period before he takes office."
17680,"Just poking my head in here: if anyone wants to know the actual legal argument here, it's Jacobson v. Massachusetts."
17681,"&gt;Real liberty for all could not exist under the operation of a principle which recognizes the right of each individual person to use his own, whether in respect of his person or his property, regardless of the injury that may be done to others."
17682,What do you mean?
17683,I've been tuned out of numbers since the cdc got yanked by Trump.
17684,"I only keep a passing reference, but if we were only at 80k 4 weeks ago, then you might be a bit conservative on your estimate."

17695,Not really an “outsider” perspective as my wife and children are Japanese.
17696,And my wife would not disagree about the slow to change.
17697,Not would almost any of my Japanese friends and family.
17698,It’s a pretty common observation.
17699,"I don’t necessarily disagree with your comment, but it is certainly putting the most favorable possible light on how things work."
17700,"As I said in a previous comment, there are benefits and negatives to any system including Japan’s."
17701,"&gt; You have a higher chance of spreading it if you go in, many are not going to quarantine for 2 weeks after."
17702,"Right but if I walked right up to the hospital right now and said ""I think I have Covid"", the doctor would say ""Do you feel symptoms?"""
17703,"and I would say ""Not yet"", and he would say ""Well go home and quarantine for 2 weeks and if you get worse come in""."
17704,And they would trust that I do that.
17705,Right?
17706,So *that's exactly the same thing*.
17707,"So why not allow me to see my mother, and then send me home to quarantine, *like they do with anybody/everybody who has been exposed to Covid and might get sick*?"
17708,It makes no sense at all.
17709,"Ironically, that user always points to NZ as a country that has accomplished that"
17710,It's not about saving lives.
17711,Their lives do not want to be saved.
17712,That's why they're doing it by population.
17713,Most of those states do not believe in vaccines.
17714,"So, they'll be in storage unused and getting spoiled."
17715,Huge percentage of people in those states(60-70%) do not believe in vaccines.
17716,This isn't about politics.
17717,This is about saving lives from those who want to be saved.
17718,"Again, you cannot and will not convince people to take a vaccine if they were brainwashed to believe it's a conspiracy theory to depopulate the world."
17719,Kind if where I pulled it from.
17720,"I watched that movie during the early pandemic, and it hit too close to home."
17721,I also know people who pull trucks with the vaccinated identification as well.
17722,Forced vaccination.
17723,Who could’ve seen that coming?
17724,RemindMe!
17725,3 weeks
17726,"If you haven't watched ""the social dilemma"" on Netflix yet, you should."
17727,The last 40 minutes of the documentary are the most important.
17728,Yet I see on Twitter when the numbers are posted people asking why they don't post the number of people dying from the flu.
17729,They think its higher and the government is trying to overplay the numbers.
17730,If you try to respond to them with the numbers they just get angry
17731,Please stop it.
17732,I know!
17733,Benefit of living close to my mom lol
17734,"You provided a specific month that contradicts other sources, which are saying spring for the general public, so you need to provide a source for that claim."
17735,No one has said anything about the next few years.
17736,I also never said anything about throwing a mask away; that was quite an assumption of you to make.
17737,"If you’re going to provide outlandish claims, you need to provide a source."
17738,This just seems lazy and spreads misinformation.
17739,This.
17740,"Most people don’t follow the fourteen day one, and since half the people get symptoms within 5 days, at least it will catch some cases, especially if more people do it."
17741,"The only problem is right now people don’t even quarantine while waiting the 1-2 days for their test results, even if they are sure it will be positive."
17742,"Good luck with that, though I do support it."
17743,My place is saying the flu vaccine is mandatory this year but with medical and religious exceptions.
17744,"And so many people on the nursing staff are like ""hell no are they injecting something into me"", and ""nope, I dont know whats in that vaccine"", and ""nope, it always makes me sick""."
17745,So they are already trying to say it's against their religion and two aides have already quit over it.

17751,Yes.
17752,"This is the headline I get:

Alabama coach Nick Saban tests positive, showing COVID-19 symptoms

He’s got symptoms this time."
17753,"If it only affects a ""small fraction"" of participants with ""very mild"" symptoms"", then why the concern about letting people know it's ""not going to be a walk in the park""?"
17754,That doesn't make sense.
17755,"And while you, some random internet person, say that you have had horrible symptoms of covid, I think it makes more sense to believe my real-life observations and experiences."
17756,Me AND most of my family and friends have been working with the public throughout this entire pandemic.
17757,"Only a few have tested positive and they were all perfectly fine, with mild to no symptoms."
17758,"A few weeks ago, my good friend tested positive."
17759,"She had been working closely with dozens of people leading up to her positive test, only one other person got it."
17760,Her husband didn't get it.
17761,"I didn't get it, and we had been hanging out, inside, maskless, sharing drinks and food just a couple days before."
17762,All she had was a headache and some muscle aches as she enjoyed her mandatory two-week staycation from work.
17763,"I realize the media wants us all to be terrified of this thing, but nothing in me or any of my friends' experience shows there is anything to be scared of."
17764,"Eight months later, none of us isolating, and we still don't even know anyone who has been hospitalized, let alone died."

17772,I live in a Midwest state.
17773,A month or two ago getting a test was pretty easy—any employee at our university could get one within a few days every week.
17774,Now it’s almost impossible to get; I’ve had coworkers have to drive an hour or two to get tested (vs driving to employee health 5 minutes away) after an exposure.

17823,There’s literally no downside to wearing masks.
17824,This is pure idiocy.
17825,Ok
17826,1.
17827,I wouldn't say a majority.
17828,Current governmant party (PiS) had lost in cities and won in villages.
17829,"PiS voters are mostly elderly and uneducated poeple who watch a lot of public TV, which is main propaganda measure for the governmant."
17830,Most elderly people are living in their hometown and they are participating in voting a lot more than young people who offen live in different place than they're scheduled to vote in.
17831,"It would require them to make an extra trip to local office to register there as a voter, but they offen don't do that (I know I didin't when I used to live 300 miles from hometown for 10 years)."
17832,Also they rarely believe they can actually change something.
17833,If you add it up and ask around you'll see there really aren't many people supporting the governmant.
17834,2.
17835,"Well yes, I don't really know the details but the highlight was that those judges decided that law signed in \~1991 was unconstitiutonal, since constitution says every human has a right to live (or something)."
17836,"This would mean that a week old fetus is already a human being, so by extention he should be given a social security number already and get same benefits as every baby and child has - currently \~130€ / month for parents (130€ is 4x more in poland than in western europe) but of course that's not happening."
17837,3.
17838,I mean seperete parties.
17839,We have some coalitions but they are no match for one PiS.
17840,PiS had 43% support and next was opposition coalition with 27% in 2019 elections.
17841,That seems excessive.
17842,"Sure, no system is perfect."
17843,Though there are indeed wait-times for some things (e.g.
17844,"dermatologists are like unicorns), and everybody likes to complain when they are not healthy, overall the benefits outweigh the negatives."
17845,Children will probably be last
17846,"Oh, and the curfew only applies to ""non-essential"" activities."
17847,It's OK to run to the 24 hour grocery store in the middle of the night.
17848,No one will take this seriously so it's all rather pointless.
17849,You mean the US is not the only country having problems controlling the virus?!?!?
17850,"You mean the Germans, touted at the beginning of the pandemic as the model of mitigation strategy and compliance is also struggling?!?!"
17851,That's not going to be a popular sentiment around here.
17852,are you one of those people who say that smokers should be denied treatment for lung cancer?
17853,I bet if that one person was you it would all of a sudden be more important to you
17854,Why is it disturbing?
17855,We do know of course that there will be enough vaccines for everybody.
17856,It just might not be enough for everybody in 2021.
17857,I don't want to really get the vacccine if i already had coronavirus...And the chances of reinfection are astronomically low
17858,I keep seeing Summer 2021.
17859,"If the goalposts move again, people will just stop on their own."
17860,While many countries who “did the right thing” and locked down with mask mandates lost much worse.
17861,"Ultimately it’s not about winning and reaching “Covid zero”, those expectations cause more harm than good."
17862,It’s about minimizing suffering of society as a whole and Sweden has done a better job at that than just about any other nation.
17863,Plus HR is for the best interest of the company not the employees
17864,It is hard to understand for this sub lol.
17865,"Half the people here treat “wishing it was safe to go home and being sad about it, but not going anyway because duh” as just as bad as going."

17872,Flying was never safe and the CDC hasn’t indicated that it is.
17873,Yeah it’s truly shocking when ppl are so worried about long term effects of a vaccine when we still don’t know how bad effects are from the virus itself.

I'm a small business owner who has fought tirelessly through this epidmenic."
17895,"As an independent restaurant, I have done everything possible to stay afloat."
17896,But we are also a wellness company.
17897,We are producing immune-boosting food for the community including immunity kits for frontline workers.
17898,Food filled with wholesome raw ingredients designed to boost immune systems and reduce inflammation.
17899,"Why is the government teaching citizens to manage sickness and play an offense game with sickess vs be  proactive and defensive:  Take Vitamin C, D, Garlic Pills, Zinc, NAC, Camu Camu-all amazing supplements to boost immune system + to eat nutrient dense foods."
17900,"This to me, is a missed opportunity to teach citizens to improve their health, provide a defense and a not gamble it and/or manage disease."
17901,Wellness isn't produced or practiced by big pharma but simple practices have a huge benefit to health.
17902,"We are killing small businesses when we could be teaching people how to kill and prevent disease and live happier, better quality lives simply with better wellness practices."

17963,actually seen the opposite.
17964,And some discourage or prohibit it on political or ideological grounds.
17965,Are young people basically destined to get covid?
17966,"So obviously the point of the vaccine is to A. stop vulnerable people from getting it first and B. to stop the spread as when 50-70%ish get artificial immunity, we rely on artificial herd immunity for the other percentage."
17967,Doesn't that essentially mean we will all 'bounce' covid off each other until most of us have had it and get natural immunity?

&gt;Thus, when postmortem examinations began to occur, there was a strong desire by pathologists to validate that clinical finding and declare any inflammation as myocarditis."
18042,"&gt;  
&gt;Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately, it has not been the case that myocarditis is occurring at that expected high frequency, and other primary or secondary cardiovascular injuries seem more likely culprits."
18043,"&gt;  
&gt;The descriptions of insignificant inflammation as “myocarditis” across these autopsies may have been an attempt to satisfy this expectation of disease, rather than represent a true viral myocarditis of the extent that can cause real cardiac injury or death."

18068,Everyone needs to remember this in 2 years when he's up for re-election.
18069,I think that now there's enough belief in herd immunity that the government really might not take any drastic measures regardless of what happens.
18070,They'll keep thinking that if it's really bad it'll surely peak soon because it must be running out of people to infect; basically they're playing chicken and expecting the virus to blink first.

18363,"The shorter it is the easier for people to comply, right now 20% don’t even stay home after a positive test (for fucks sake)."

18366,They are directly inciting domestic terrorism with lies and conspiracy BS in my view.
18367,They need to be held criminally accountable for anyone who buys into it and then acts.
18368,This.
18369,I've been buying pretty or interesting masks off Etsy.
18370,I like wearing them and I've gotten quite a few compliments.
18371,Huh?
18372,No state is going to drop mask laws over theft.
18373,You are just trolling at this point.
18374,"Not sure, but I know that OANN had a story a few months ago claiming ""Calif."
18375,"Doctor Successfully Cures 1,700 COVID-19 Patients"" using hydroxychloriquine."
18376,"The article is now gone from their website (still in Google cache though), but the YouTube video is still up."
18377,"You can imagine all the YouTube comments under the video -- basically a lot of conspiratorial BS about how the medical industry, the media, and the libs are hiding the truth and Trump was right all along."
18378,It is designed to keep the poor dependent on welfare and discourage escaping welfare.

18388,Not really.
18389,It’s not widespread enough for people to be unable to ignore it.
18390,I’m talking where it’s no longer refutable by even the craziest of crazies: The type who don’t believe shit until it happens to them.
18391,True.
18392,"Those come into play too, it’s all why we got to get this under control."

18413,In the form of fire and the word of God.
18414,I think the entire world would benefit from the religious conservatives having less control of our military.

18420,"What do you think of the theory that the United States doesn't have as many internal Islamic terror attacks because the United States is better at culturally accepting immigrants, and Europe is worse?"
18421,Or maybe Europe just plain has many more muslim immigrants?
18422,Or maybe they have a colonial history with muslims that the United States doesn't have?
18423,The United States doesn't have many terror attacks for a country that elected Trump and is militarily involved all over the middle east and it doesn't make sense.
18424,How do they know this though?
18425,Thanksgiving for me this year is me my wife our 3 year old and my in laws.
18426,My in laws are retired and don’t leave the house.
18427,My wife and I work from home with our 3 yr old and don’t go anywhere either.
18428,How’s that a 50% chance?
18429,"I mean, I guess I believe it but it seems unreasonably high"
18430,Well stated.
18431,"And don't forget their core base, the elderly."
18432,Many are good people with age related cognitive decline and they also come from a time when you could take most people at their word which makes them easy pickings in the modern age.
18433,You also get peer pressure as good people retire and move into communities where a couple cultists are working nonstop to indoctrinate others because they have all day free to do it and it's all they have now.
18434,That makes no sense.
18435,Why waste my time getting tested if I have no symptoms and haven't been exposed?
18436,Seems like a waste of money but to each their own.
18437,I know a nurse who is flying home from a hotspot to another hotspot for Thanksgiving
18438,Can you share a news story for this?

18464,"Each analysis demonstrated that, following directives from organizational and political leadership for universal masking, new infections fell significantly."
18465,Two of these studies and an additional analysis of data from 200 countries that included the U.S. also demonstrated reductions in mortality.
18466,"An economic analysis using U.S. data found that, given these effects, increasing universal masking by 15% could prevent the need for lockdowns and reduce associated losses of up to $1 trillion or about 5% of gross domestic product."

18576,"Like how to stop bleeding, change bedding, administer drugs, etc."
18577,They seem to skip over the actual science part behind medicine and just go to taking care of patients.
18578,Majority of my family are nurses and they seem to have this complex about them.
18579,Where they feel superior on medical issues but when you point out a science thing they dismiss it.
18580,"Like the masks thing, airflow to avoid Covid-19 lingering in the air, general societal distancing etc."
18581,Had many arguments with family nurses about the masks and all that.
18582,Mentioned when I have people over I open all the windows and turn a fan on and wear masks.

18599,"&gt;  The ongoing issues in the middle east, the rise of ISIS, the spread of violent religious philosophy all have happened or are happening now."
18600,Many of those conditions were **worsened** or flat-out **created** (ISIS) by the War on Terror.
18601,30 days later and we're in purple tier like the entire state.
18602,"Still doing relatively well, I suppose"
18603,"Lol I've already switched to stores that don't require masks, a law won't magically make everybody comply."
18604,"Also most states have anti-mask laws that are suspended by health orders, once health orders expire they'll be illegal to wear."
18605,"And considering those bans exist to allow arresting black bloc, I doubt they'll go away even after covid."

18608,"Yet, they still don't let facts impede their fantasies."
18609,"Yeah you think that, but you are doing the anti-vax dance."

18614,"A single Covid hospitalization costs more than this, so I don't understand their math."
18615,Exactly.
18616,The people who choose to be responsible/cautious aren’t going to suddenly throw it out the window just because a small portion of high priority people have been vaccinated.
18617,"Likewise, the people who choose to ignore simple health recommendations aren’t going to feel they need a vaccine at all, or at least won’t change their lifestyle between now and then."
18618,And people don’t get it for those reasons.
18619,Not for much longer though I bet.
18620,Too many people think they are immune to the CDC recommendation to not have multiple household Thanksgiving celebrations.
18621,Makes the sacrifices I’ve made since the start of the pandemic feel completely useless.
18622,Speaking as someone who was living in NYC as of the beginning of this year - we screamed it from the rooftops.
18623,If anyone dug a hole and buried their heads in the sand - I have zero sympathy at this point.
18624,I don't think the math checks out on this one.
18625,"Even if you don't die, it sucks to have the virus."
18626,"It's awful, even for 20 year Olds."
18627,"It's probably true that some masks are better than others for COVID protection, but any mask is better than none (excepting novelty &amp; lace crap)."
18628,Working with COVID patients indoors  is a very different risk than walking down the street.
18629,"Hell yeah I would want an N95, face shield, full Tyvek hazmat suit in the COVID ward."
18630,"Note: IANAD, opinions are my own."
18631,Oh okay my bad I tried and it seem to work but maybe it’s not as accurate as your way.
18632,At least warmer weather and vitamin D exposure is keeping Florida somewhat in Check Though lately the local news has been getting worse every day so
18633,Or the medical staff who treat grandma.
18634,Or anyone else who was at the Thanksgiving dinner.
18635,And it's not like you got COVID and you either die or you're fine.
18636,Just look at the COVID long haulers.
18637,"And, we don't know what the long-term effects of having COVID-19 will be."

18649,Saying and doing are two separate things
18650,No idea but it cant take a year to set up even a small amount of production.
18651,Even just enough for our healthcare workers while we wait for the rest to come from elsewhere.
18652,I can totally understand that the elderly have a hard time dealing with this when they don't have that much time left in their existence.
18653,You either let them live freely and take high risks or force them to complete isolation.
18654,Totally sucks.
18655,No it's not revisionist.
18656,"Vaccination was the desired endgame from the very beginning, when it was clear enough that this virus is nothing to laugh at."
18657,"Flattening the curve, giving the hospitals a break was only the mid-game goal, to survive, remember?"
18658,"Everyone knew people can't live under total lockdown forever, so obviously there had to be a game changer."
18659,"OK tried to post this as a separate post....   Makes me want to scream and throw things at TV when I was watching news and some ""medical expert"" is on saying shit like ""There is no such thing as a safe vaccine....""    Well doofus there is no such thing as a safe case of covide either."
18660,WTF is the matter  with these people?
18661,Why would they be saying shit like that?
18662,"I guess we know why they lied about masks, but why are they saying the stuff that they are now on network news?"
18663,In my County for 25 people the chance is .
18664,9997 that one will be positive.
18665,That’s crazy.
18666,The only person I know who has died from this was Filipino (but not a nurse).

18668,"Yeah, I can also see a lot of private businesses taking on policies like this for liability reasons."
18669,"Like I can just see there's inevitably going to be some kind of case where some anti-vax moron spreads COVID to someone else, let's say it's on a flight or something, and one of the infected people sues the airline for negligence and medical bills because they didn't take enough reasonable precautions with regard to COVID."
18670,"Whether they would actually have any case to begin with, sure maybe not, and whether a policy of vaccinated people only is actually really foolproof doesn't really matter."
18671,At least it makes things easier for the airline if they can point to the policy and say they had a safety policy in place and the person who came on board and infected people was breaching their policy - e.g.
18672,"they lied about being vaccinated when they weren't, etc."

18810,"Yeah, it sounds stupid but even the nurses at my doctors' office started to sound scared when I told them about our symptoms and that we'd been to the big hospital that had at least one covid patient in ICU before we were sick."
18811,My doctor now doesn't think an antibody test will really tell us anything as they weren't accurate enough for him to want to do it and it's not like I'm desperate to pay the copay for it so I'll continue to live as if I didn't possibly have it because I Do Not Want whatever we had ever again and we did a good job not giving the illness to my immunocompromised mother (who we live with) by basically staying in one room for 2 months and I'll do anything I can to make sure she doesn't get it.

18954,Then read the data and draw your own conclusions.

19032,Definitely.
19033,Too cold in the northeast to spend much time outside now.
19034,I can't imagine how this virus doesn't start to encounter some natural resistance after this winter.
19035,The numbers are staggering and we're still missing a large amount of cases regardless.
19036,There is zero control in the US at this point.

19050,The mental health impact on nurses is probably substantial.
19051,"Instead of giving people privacy, they are there to witness these dying moments of people they can't save."
19052,"And it's not just a couple of deaths, it's massive amounts of deaths."
19053,A lot of these nurses are going to need PTSD help.
19054,"Mandating vaccines is only going to make anti-vaxxers angry, the better option would be to pay everyone who gets the vaccine another stimulus check, that way people don’t starve to death and the vaccine gets rolled out quickly."
19055,I have a bridge in Brooklyn for anyone who think's the government is going to accomplish this without f--king up.
19056,I realize people on here are desperate to return to life as they knew it before March 2020 but the reality is that the vaccination process is going to be a huge clusterbeep.

19059,If it’s not a bad view he should have no problem right?
19060,I’m just gonna add to your comment.
19061,While I am definitely on the side of closing things until we get a real plan implemented because these lock downs are consequences for not taking it seriously.
19062,The anger from everyone affected by this should be directed by the government not providing us any sort of money or stimulus fucking bill.
19063,While it was okay to continue golfing the entire time and giving corporations and wealthy individuals a slush fund.
19064,I can definitely see airports and even public transportation sill having to uphold face masks.
19065,"I am not so sure about a lot of other places, though."
19066,Is that her choice or yours?
19067,Just curious.
19068,This isn’t surprising given how rural America sees science as evil socialism.
19069,It is so sad that even in death they can not see past their prejudices.
19070,And that sucks balls.

19074,"If a vaccine is approved tomorrow it will still need to be manufactured, transported, distributed, and administered."
19075,Think about how many people there are in the US.
19076,"An effective vaccine is a reason to hope, not a finish line."
19077,Most probably.
19078,There is always going to be a few of *those* people.

19097,Get a finger pulse oximeter.
19098,Covid pneumonia is unusual in that people tend to feel fine even as their pulse ox drops and then they crash hard.
19099,They also don't normally show signs of hypoxia until things are really bad.
19100,If your Oxygen sat drops below 85 call a hospital.
19101,Some people get not other symptom till the pneumonia knocks them out.
19102,It's why I bought a pulse oximeter early on and randomly test myself even without other symptoms.
19103,Venus!
19104,Nice example of climate change.
19105,Don’t forget that Americans are the only ignorant people out there.
19106,"K, wise one."
19107,Have fun.
19108,I think the Biden administration will help our friends to the north.
19109,We should do it for many reasons but it would be a good start to repairing foreign relations.
19110,Has there been a poll to check if people in those areas are really surprised by this?
19111,I just asked my husband ;Are they are essential?
19112,Becadue we both are healthcare workers and haven't been told SHIT about getting a vaccine here.
19113,"They make like nothing, there are like no Car companies in canada."
19114,Great.
19115,"That'll prevent about 80k infections, or half of a single day."
19116,Good
19117,"And, for those unaware, saline is literally just slightly salty water."
19118,That's it.
19119,Exactly how I feel.
19120,"I think two of the vaccines are also showing data that was indicating that if you did get Covid once vaccinated, that the symptoms were also greatly reduced and you had significantly less chance of getting hospitalized."
19121,So most likely get more regular flu-like symptoms and less chance of serious long-term health consequences...ie.
19122,"bloot clots, lung scarring, cognitive problems, etc."
19123,They haven't showed all the data on that yet...but that would be huge and would make me feel a whole lot safer.
19124,We have stopped having to wear them as we are free of cases but everyone still carries them around anyway.
19125,The Health Department says one of the guests spent time in the hospital but has since recovered.
19126,No deaths and one person required a brief hospital visit.
19127,You're spreading misinformation.
19128,Get you shit together.

19142,There was not a massive spike this past weekend.
19143,Source:  I travel extensively for work.
19144,I’m literally sitting in my second airport of the day that’s MORE empty than it has been going back to August.

19146,Stlll?
19147,!
19148,"No, it's good math."
19149,"But it's *probability,* which most people don't inherently understand."
19150,Probability says your likelihood of having fallopian tubes is ~0.5.
19151,Which *it is* as a sample against the entire population.
19152,It does *not* say that you have 1 fallopian tube; and stating that it does is fundamentally misunderstanding what probability is.
19153,It's not a method of determining an average or an expected amount.

19157,I really wish they would be less specific with those estimates.
19158,Just say late spring/early summer.
19159,Manage expectations.

19162,"I wouldn't know, I don't work for the government"
19163,Yep.
19164,H1N1 (which I think I had and sucked) caused everyone to shutdown everything and we should all stop interacting or going to big gatherings!
19165,Dude I think when the next time someone we don’t like gets in the white house then we should just stop working and demand to be paid.
19166,"You mean the vaccine named bnt162b2 was created by BioNTech, not Pfizer?"
19167,And why would a foreign company not be eager to surrender their IP to the US?
19168,This all blows my mind!
19169,That’s good since there are no trials for the COVId vaccine on children
19170,There is no known cure.
19171,There are vaccines that will be ready soon.
19172,Anything claiming otherwise is clearly wrong.
19173,It's quite simple.
19174,We don't need to know what specific lie they were telling.
19175,No cure exists.
19176,No clickbait.
19177,I’m actually extremely death-positive but this title is misleading
19178,Law of the nature.
19179,Covid is an enveloped.
19180,The spike protein is anchored in a fatty lipid bilayer that surrounds the nucleocapsid.
19181,Washing with soap destroys covid by removing the lipid bilayer and denaturing the spike protein.
19182,This renders the virus inert.
19183,Also most laundry detergent now contains enzymes which would also breakdown the virus.
19184,So wash your mask.
19185,"Right, but this article is about the UK."

19202,Student debt is the only debt where the interest rates is equal for everyone regardless of their ability to repay or collateral pledged

19204,How old do I have to be?
19205,Yes everything has risks.
19206,By emphasizing the risk of the Covid vaccines you enable the anti-vaxxers even if you don't intend that.

19312,I don't think that way.
19313,I live in reality.
19314,"Not sure if you do, though."
19315,"Not sure, but if you were determined to make the pandemic as bad as possible, setting a day where everyone goes to meet their grandparents at the height of the outbreak would be the way to go."
19316,It's called a deadman switch.
19317,"Somebody didn't win an election, so everyone gets punished"
19318,The Oxford vaccine is not 90% effective.
19319,It was a dosing fuck up mistake that was given only to a small number of people who all turned out to be in the UK and all under 55.
19320,It’s a total disaster and everyone is predicting that it won’t get approved in the US.

19326,"My plan is to make the best looking food and then keep going ""mmm, this is so good."
19327,"Too bad you can't taste it""."
19328,My kids would be disappointed if I didn't do something assholish for the holiday.
19329,That's a very shitty choice they're giving you!
19330,I'm sorry.
19331,I'm an ECE and I'm terrified of going back after Thanksgiving!
19332,Mostly because my oldest is in school and has had 2 exposures in 2 months.
19333,My youngest goes to my school and we haven't had any  direct exposure So Far...I'm worried that is about to change next week.
19334,I'm applying to teach virtually to 2 different jobs tomorrow and offer to go virtual for families at our school who do not feel safe.
19335,"If my job lets me, cool!"
19336,"If not, I'm done."
19337,I hate going into my hometown sub reddit because of the supreme dismissiveness in it about the covid upsurge.

19341,May I ask if you are even of age to be using Reddit?
19342,"Are you aware that the FDA publishes a ""packaging insert"" with all medications and vaccines which includes pertinent information that the consumer is intended to read?"
19343,"Are you aware that there are many, many, many people who have various medical conditions that are contra-indicated for particular vaccines or at particular times?"
19344,"Simplest example being pregnant women and live vaccines, for instance."
19345,"Are you aware that the FDA does not advise that ""all"" people get ""all"" vaccines?"
19346,"Nor does the ""medical establishment"" (which, btw, what the hell is that?"

19351,"Some small number of people are susceptible to GBS, etc."
19352,"In sum, you are saying things here that are way, way, way above your paygrade and I'd advise you to learn a bit to understand the world is quite a bit more diverse and complicated than you seem to understand."

19357,Maybe they only wear them when people are looking.
19358,It might have flattened naturally if there was no Christmas or Thanksgiving by running out of new hosts in specific locations.
19359,But the holidays basically shake the box of hosts so they all mixed together and can maximize infection across the country.
19360,I've basically heard that outdoors is almost 100% safe and that while some particles will travel around it wont be enough to infect.
19361,"Large corporations, governments, political parties etc."

19366,* Stage 4: Attack the solutions as too costly.

19380,My mother hung up on me today because I told her it’s unsafe right now for me to drive 8 hours to spend thanksgiving with my family.
19381,It’s heartbreaking but I can’t fathom the idea of contributing to the death of someone else.
19382,Peak reddit comment and why nobody takes this board seriously.
19383,Severe headaches.

19397,Getting hit by a truck or what seems like the most uncomfortable and unnecessary dinner ever for a holiday I never really liked in the first place?
19398,That's because nurses are generally not as will trained.
19399,Have you ever gone fishing and you cast your line over and over again.
19400,You start to get the feeling you’re not catching anything that day.
19401,But then all of a sudden.
19402,You feel that first little tug on the line.
19403,That feeling.
19404,Knowing you got one.
19405,That’s a great feeling dude
19406,Like you’ve never misspelled a word in your life
19407,"Yeah, my family is disappointed that I'm not going to be attending."
19408,My state has about 1 in 40 people expected to be actively contagious with the virus.
19409,My parents are both near 80 years old and this would be an intergenerational gathering from three different counties across the state.
19410,"A tipping point for me is that I live four stories up in a very large apartment building, which I estimate has about 100 people sharing a small elevator and two stairwells."
19411,"Mask usage is ""ok"" at about 70% for people in the hallways and elevator but it's a pet friendly apartment and therefore high traffic in the hallways and elevator with people taking their dogs out for a walk a couple times a day in addition to picking up mail/packages, going to work, the store, etc."
19412,I also live only 1/2 mile from a hospital and it's common to encounter doctors/nurses in scrubs on my way in and out of the apartment.
19413,I have no idea whether they work with COVID patients.
19414,It's not worth the risk.
19415,Most retail stores can’t even enforce the mask mandates.
19416,You’re dreaming if you think that they’re going to be checking if people have been vaccinated.
19417,Why just pig heads it could be any frozen item then.
19418,Oh maybe pig head is staple food for majority of poor so this is a way to politicize blame.
19419,"All but the shooting, this happens every day by the tens of thousands or more."
19420,What has the Federal Government done about this?
19421,What have state governments done to immediately apply penalties on those who leave the rest of us out of the cycle?
19422,Have you tried not drooling?
19423,We need to take care of ourselves first.
19424,After that absolutely.
19425,"Are they just now getting around to the hydroxychloroquine hoax, or is it a different thing?"
19426,You make a good point.
19427,I wonder if the lead up to thanksgiving itself causes a bit of a drop due to reductions in other travel in the weeks prior and also maybe some selfish or stupid people not getting tested so as not to interrupt their holiday plans.
19428,"There was evidence of a lot of that in the original outbreak in Wuhan, people even knowingly taking medicine to avoid showing symptoms while travelling."
19429,Fantastic

19438,"Covid-19 is more deadly, but more importantly, it's far more contagious, and is easier to transmit thanks to a longer incubation period and asymptomatic spread, to a population that has no inoculation against it."
19439,We don't shut the economy down anytime an equal number of deaths occurs due to something else because the danger of covid-19 lies in how fast it spreads.
19440,300 car crash deaths don't necessitate businesses shutting down because businesses being open do not result in exponential car crash deaths increase.
19441,"If people even voted, let alone voted informed and with intent."
19442,"They’ve chosen money, Israel and the USA over Palestine’s dignity."
19443,These results radically contradict what we were being told about hydroxychloroquine's ineffectiveness.
19444,What to make of it?
19445,Yeah things are bad in the states but it’s not like some European countries are fine and dandy.

19482,You think your spreading the flu by not wearing a mask is better than someone spreading measles by not vaccinating?
19483,I'd love to hear your reasoning.
19484,It was just more bullshit about Hydroxychloroquine.
19485,They did a piece about some quack doctor who said he's healed over a thousand people with it.

19567,We know.
19568,Everyone knows.
19569,The anti maskers know.
19570,People either care or don’t at this point.

19575,"He was released from prison about a month ago, and tested positive for covid shortly before being released."
19576,I'd like to spend some time with him but with him coming from out of town I'd like to know more about the odds of reinfection.
19577,Am I wrong to think if you had covid at most 3 months ago the odds of reinfection are slim?
19578,Common in Asia.
19579,Heck even common with the temporary foreign farm workers in Canada.
19580,What's crazy is that this is one of Trumps few remaining outlets.
19581,"He's such a narcissist, that any and all support that he can get probably feeds his ego in some way."

19583,"I mean I get what you are saying but you do understand that the government “pays for” nothing, the people pay taxes and those taxes “pay for” things."

19587,I just don’t understand how they are both evil AND the people that should be regulating what people see on the internet.
19588,Dang I mixed up the testing numbers with the positive numbers.
19589,"Regardless, many epidemiologists seem to agree that saying we're missing 1/5 cases is a reasonable assumption."
19590,"So assuming we're only catching 1/5 of the cases each day, then yeah, it would take about only .1% (slightly more) of the population being positive to reach that number."
19591,Which is the case in the *worst* counties (and the article says up to).
19592,The word “literal” is overused and often used inappropriately when not used in a clickbait headline.

19604,"If he’s so confident, why not go ahead and make it available to frontline medical workers and consenting elderly today?"
19605,Making it available to lower-risk demographics can wait for the FDA meeting since the supply is still building.
19606,How much of the analysis that they’re going to do now could have been done while the study was ongoing?
19607,"I know three weeks is lightspeed for the approval process, but it’s absolutely valid to ask why they need to take those three weeks right as we’re hitting the worst part yet."

19633,I worry this is going to be the case in far too many states in the next few months.
19634,We're at the point where we could really hunker down and ride this out with several vaccines in sight.
19635,But instead we're doubling down and trying to ride this thing till the wheels fall off
19636,Yep.
19637,That’s how we roll in the US apparently.

19646,I wonder if hospitalizations and deaths will be lower this week than they might have been because of people holding off on testing/treatment because they dont want to 'ruin the holiday'.
19647,"O figure of someone is willing to downplay the virus, then they may also be willing to pretend they dont have a cough just so they can see grandma."
19648,"Look at the positivity rate, numbskull."
19649,40% means there is no room for error
19650,"One Chinese poster to any Westerner reading:

Many of the principles and measures that China used against the virus predate modern states and ideologies."
19651,They represent experience of all humanity accumulated throughout many centuries.
19652,"However, the constant demonization by your governments and media outlets against us has led to those measures becoming politicized and averted when you needed it, eventually leading to the tragic situation you're in right now."
19653,"With the level of general hostility from the Western world against China, it should be in China's interest that the West remain in denial of China's success and avert similar measures."
19654,"After all, your disbelief is not harming us, and Covid-19 doesn't transmit by 5G or any part of the internet for that matter, and we are already on high alert against virus on imported goods."

19657,Some of us have not given us despite such realizations.
19658,"Drop the delusion, stop politicizing medical science, and save yourselves."
19659,I don't expect any major change to happen though.
19660,We have some idea - it's not super different from SARS-CoV-1.
19661,"But SARS-CoV-2 went full global pandemic unlike SARS-CoV-1 which ended up petering out, we're just seeing a lot more data this time around and with a lot more pre-existing conditions mixing in."
19662,Holy shit you're disabled and on SSI too?
19663,Really nuts how we've bumped into each other like this!
19664,"My grandma's up several hours away by car and my therapist is working entirely over the phone due to COVID, so I'm only going for outdoor walks around the part of town where I live."

19666,"There was one entering clinical trials in Nov 2019, I think for Zika."

19670,"Sweden is current 45th in case per million, below many European countries."
19671,Kinda remarkable.
19672,The states got a lot of Cares Act money to support businesses.
19673,"In Vermont almost every business was able to receive a grant to make them whole for the months of March-September as compared to their 2019 income, with the grant cap at $300,000."
19674,Most small business will make it to the other side with that grant support.
19675,"Wouldn't extremely low interest rates, increased ability to socially isolate, and substantially greater work from home opportunities all be incentives?"
19676,"Cool, you start your own to go along with every other failed youtube competition."
19677,"Not sure if the members of Parler, would agree with you."
19678,Yeah it's definitely not just like the flu.
19679,"I thought I would be fine too if I got it as I'm only 20 and reasonably healthy, but weeks after I've tested negative I still have a lingering headache as well as breathing and heart issues that weren't present pre covid."
19680,"Frankly we still don't know much about covid but simply saying that it's just like the flu might be true for some people, but far too many people have already died from this virus or are experiencing long term symptoms with no end in sight much like myself."
19681,That makes sense.
19682,"If we assume that 20% are in high priority groups with access to earlier vaccination, March to May is enough time to vaccinate 50% of the US."
19683,We already give 45% of the population a flu vaccine in the course of a couple months every year.
19684,"I realize that each vaccination is two shots, but from what I've seen in my community, the pharmacists, nurses, and medical assistants who routinely give vaccines could conceivably handle double the volume."

19689,Well documented history of treating these kinds of epidemics and their side effects.
19690,People deny that the moon landing happened and that the earth is round in spite of a mountain of evidence proving both.
19691,You think they won’t just claim the footage of people dying from COVID is fake and liberal hoax?
19692,There’s literally no point in try to prove anything with actual evidence.
19693,There’s a frighteningly large population that won’t believe any amount of facts or evidence put in front of them because they’re incapable of admitting they’re wrong.
19694,"&gt; Well have enough for 50 million people by Spring

This one is logical to say early considering all the front-running vaccines were being made way ahead of time of approval"
19695,"Your relative view of ""quickly"" does not track with what the medical reality of ""quick"" is."

19722,And why do I have to get into which is obviously off topic conversation as an attempt to drag things into politics while you can't argue the fact?

19728,Yes.
19729,I thought it was supposed to be 95%?
19730,"Oh well, if the standards are lowered some people might decide to wear masks."
19731,"&gt;More than 1,300 nursing homes across the U.S. reported having three or more confirmed Covid-19 cases during the first week of November — the highest number ever reported in a single week, according to an NBC News analysis of federal data."
19732,"The figure does not include outbreaks at assisted living facilities, which the federal government does not track."
19733,"Yes, they should just let the Anti-Vaxxers claim it's dangerous and ineffective since the moment anyone even suggested trying to make a vaccine for Covid-19."
19734,"No need to give anyone an update from time to time, and counter the Anti-Vaxxers garbage."
19735,Gay sex
19736,There are no vaccines with any kind of long term side effects.
19737,"Any negative side effects have always been found within a few months, not like 5 years later."
19738,That's literally not how vaccines work.
19739,"Obviously, it's not 'impossible' to happen ever, but this is why the clinical trials exist in the first place"
19740,"Couple reasons

1."
19741,"It's OANN
2."
19742,"Everyone knows there's no 'cure', if there was it would be big fucking news."
19743,I can definitively say with 1000% certainty whatever they proposed it complete and utter bullshit.
19744,Yeah sure OANN scientists discovered the cure for covid19.
19745,See how dumb that sounds?
19746,Did you ever confirm your vaccination with an antibody test?
19747,I’ve seen several patients in my clinic for post-COVID syndrome.
19748,One guy has a completely normal work up but severe dyspnea.
19749,We have no idea how this works long-term and likely won’t know for a long time.
19750,One of the worst feelings is when you tell a patient “I don’t know what to do.”
19751,"The irony is that if people spend Thanksgiving together, it's possible that they might spend their last Christmas at home together as well because there are certainly not enough ICU beds to take care of everyone that will need them after this disaster in the making."
19752,Hope everyone has started assembling their own ICU facility in their living room by now.

19755,"Their ""restrictions"" are still extremely light and are usually not even ""restrictions"" but instead more ""we recommend this""

Also, these ""restrictions"" are not coming from Tegnell."
19756,He has actually been throwing shade on the government lately that they are basically overreacting.
19757,Wouldn't 70% by May essentially be the end of the pandemic at 95% effectiveness?

19762,That's probably worse than death to him.
19763,I think the right way to view it is that there is no comparison.
19764,"With 60-70 years having passed, what we are experiencing today has never happened and therefore what constitutes “fast”, can’t be determined from past events."
19765,Serious question.

19779,"Stupid question, but don't those big seafood freezers supposedly go to like -60 when turned all the way cold?"
19780,"Couldn't you put a foam cooler with dry ice, then the vaccine, then more dry ice on top into a -60 seafood freezer to help slow the sublimation of dry ice?"
19781,Its not like you need to store it for weeks and weeks.
19782,"Ship enough to vaccinate critical workers in an area, vaccinate them on their day off over the course of a week or two, along with plant workers."

19806,"I didn't read this comment properly, did I?"

19832,Do people even believe this fuck shit.
19833,I laughed out loud.
19834,"This entire let's open everything rhetoric and ""studies"" that push this narrative has strangely become comical to me."
19835,I prepping myself for more laughs at the idiotic responses I'm going to get from this comment.
19836,Let me get my wine first.
19837,Here's the thing: we usually consistently get about 50-70 deaths.
19838,"Yesterday we had 6 reported, and the day before that, 0."
19839,"So I am inclined to think this is a backlog issue, not a sudden spike"

19849,Don't think the NYE spike is gonna be that big.
19850,People are fucking lonely and they're stretching rules to allow themselves to hang out with family.
19851,"One of the main problems here in Mexico is that the ""free"" testing is virtually impossible to get, you'd have to be on a hospital bed about to die and then MAYBE you will get it, if you want one you can pay $50-$100 to a private clinic (about a week and a half of the minimum wage here btw)."
19852,The government should definitely pay for massive testing everywhere in the world
19853,"That looks quite good, and testing volume is steady."
19854,Hope it continues.
19855,What the fuck?
19856,(6) pregnant women are at higher risk of severe complications due to covid.
19857,"Well there are still about 100,000 extra bodies in the US alone in that time."

19865,We have people in America in these factories processing food despite the workers testing positive for Covid.

19931,Maybe you can cook something new that you enjoy.
19932,"At any rate, even a can of baked beans on toast is a better Thanksgiving when eaten with love and thankfulness than a huge spread with the family that endangers all."
19933,Hope you find something good to have!
19934,"And did you think Japan decided to postpone the olympic for a whole year for shits and giggles, despite astronomical losses?"
19935,At that point they had to admit that this is going to last longer than a few weeks.
19936,What did you think we were buying hospital the time for?
19937,Immediately back to normal only for the virus to surge again every couple months and repeat the endless cyle of agony?
19938,Because that's precisely what's done and what's happening in the US and some part of Europe.
19939,"No.. the original goal of lockdown, which is a last resort solution because they already lost the initiative, was to 'reset' the spread and get a second wind."
19940,"Buy some time to plan ahead, empty beds, prepare supplies, ramp up testing, implement a working contact tracing."
19941,We were and are expected to _keep_ flattening the curve.
19942,Nobody really moved the goalpost.
19943,The goal was always at the same spot.
19944,"If you truly thought 4 weeks of hunkering down would end an epidemic, your intelligence is sub-optimal."

19965,Sounds like a good reason to shut the whole world down.

19981,Burn down all the 25G towers?
19982,Husband and I went to Costco in San Diego today to do our normal monthly shopping and get some stuff for Thanksgiving.
19983,It’s just gonna be the two of us.
19984,But my god.
19985,There were entire families there stocking up on paper plates and cups and soooo many pies and whipped cream.
19986,"D: Like quantities that will feed a gathering, not just an individual family."
19987,I can just see the super spreading event happening.

20001,Levine said that?
20002,Seriously her and Wolf are fucking idiots if they think that’s gonna fly.
20003,People are already looking at the  “limited-time” 6 week “only leave your house for essential reasons” order and saying deez nuts
20004,Incentivizing the vaccine is an option.
20005,"PHO can allow vaccinated folks to enjoy travel, restaurants and other amenities."
20006,Not to mention higher priority when triage is necessary at hospital emergency rooms.
20007,It's easier and safer manage patients who are not a risk to medical staff.

20044,There is a difference between Anti-vaxxer and apprehensive about brand new vaccine for a year old virus using brand new vaccine technology.
20045,The long term effects of RNA vaccines are not known and particularly of this vaccine.
20046,It is different to the standard mature vaccines that have been around for a while.
20047,"I will definetely get vaccinated but i don't want to be amongst the first to receive it, and if given the choice would prefer the Oxford or University of Queensland one to an RNA vaccine."
20048,Thanks.
20049,I had a few typos and missing words due to typing on cell.
20050,Fixed that and sjojld read better.
20051,"Still, long story short... hospitals can handle small bouts of capacity issues contained to specific resources (be it beds, staff, supplies, etc.)."
20052,COVID forces the need for increased capacity everywhere.
20053,Enough patients and it overtakes the ability for hospital to care for their regular patients.
20054,"Even some ""elective"" surgery might not feel elective to patients."
20055,"If you delay routine diagnostic imaging, you could catch cancer too late."

20057,I feel like these things were discussed early but everyone has ignored this.
20058,I'm not sure why we arent focusing on flattening the curve again.
20059,"I get that not everyone feels we can or should try to eliminate the virus from community via sustain, aggressive lockdowns."
20060,But what ever happened to not overwhelming hospitals?
20061,The tough part now is we are all experiencing it simultaneously and this is a huge strain on testing supplies and PPE.
20062,And what the hell can a hospital due to if these things simply don't exist?
20063,You can only be so creative before you start risking staff and patients.
20064,The hospital has no ability to stop it either.
20065,It's all in the hands of the community... and my faith is low.

20082,"Those gatherings, in private, would never be masked."
20083,"Close schools and you'll have tons of play dates, moms chatting over wine 3x/week, and kids playing maskless with groups of other kids."

20098,85 million died in WWII.
20099,we will get back to normal.
20100,Until we have the virus well on the way out in your area.
20101,"Before that, getting the virus to be on the way out will be more important, and even those vaccinated will have to contribute."
20102,"Timewise, at the latest I think this would be early summer, around when magically it went away last year during our half-assed US lockdowns."

20111,He fucking challenged a Doctor on whether a sauna could kill the virus.
20112,Never listened since.
20113,"Yup, any time I leave the house."
20114,And while I am a stay at home my husband works all day out in public and while he wears a mask he could still catch it and bring it home so here's hoping that doesn't happen.
20115,"I have a hard enough time understanding people that would put themselves in the petri dish of a cruise ship *at anytime*, let alone during a pandemic where the borders between countries can shut at any time."

20120,"Wow, they all look like a bunch of real badasses!"
20121,Did they all drive in together in that pick up?
20122,"They should all have their names put on a public website, then if any of them get sick and go into the hospital to take up precious bedspace, we can send in fake nurses and doctors to rub essential oils on them and wave crystals over their foreheads to cure them!"

20139,I don’t agree with shutdowns but if you’re gonna do it then actually give the people affected the assistance they need (from the small business owners to the employees).
20140,If there’s money after then maybe help out the chain places but look after the people who actually need it !
20141,Christ man...
20142,Nothing is exponential for long.
20143,"&gt;North Dakota has 167 COVID-19 cases per 100,000, while Wyoming has 140 coronavirus infections per 100,000, followed by South Dakota with 124,000 cases per 100K,

20170,There was an often quoted study that showed Vitamin D having a beneficial effect for Covid-19.
20171,This article examined the details and found that the group receiving Vitamin D has significantly less patients with diabetes and high blood pressure.
20172,"*""With COVID-19, we know that both diabetes and high blood pressure are risk factors that are likely to cause a severe progression of the disease,"" says Smollich."
20173,"""So it's no wonder that patients in the group without vitamin D ended up in intensive care more often."
20174,"""*

20208,"Sweden has constantly been compared with its neighbours, none of which did ""draconian lockdown measures""."

20210,Denmarks economic drop is basically the same as Swedens.
20211,Can't say I'm seeing much benefit in Swedish approach.
20212,To what degree?
20213,Anyone would a sound mind would take account proven evidence but not necessarily take it for granted as true.
20214,I'd want several studies with significant magnitudes to make a decision.

20224,"It will be won, like most statewide elections, by moderates."
20225,Who will win?
20226,Ask yourself why three months ago moderates were so afraid of giving democrats full control they split their vote between Biden and republicans down ticket.
20227,Has those things that made moderates afraid of democrats changed in the last three weeks?
20228,Who have you heard more from there?
20229,AoC or Biden?

20337,"Hell, out of the famous 7 characteristics of life, nanobots achieving more criterion than viruses will become reality soon (say a decade maybe)."
20338,"As nanobots use more and more custom organic parts and materials, the line will blur."

20462,"By [Spencer Wilson](https://www.kktv.com/authors/Spencer%20Wilson/)*Published:* *Nov. 24, 2020 at 6:45 PM MST*

COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (KKTV) - If UCHealth ICU nurse Hannah Paik could take everyone on a field trip on her hospital floor safely, she would."
20463,"She wants everyone to know what’s happening in our communities, even if you can’t see it first hand."
20464,"“We’d have you turn and prone patients with us!’ Paik added, sarcastically."
20465,State data shows Colorado Springs only has 14 open ICU beds as of Tuesday and local hospitals are now preparing for the moment when they will not have space to care for those who need it most.
20466,"Paik says on her floor at Memorial Hospital in Colorado Springs, she’s already seen makeshift beds to help with the surging caseload."
20467,"“It doesn’t feel like there is an end in sight,” Paik said."
20468,"The nurse works 12 or 13 hour shifts and said keeping up morale has been a challenge when she and her coworkers are faced with a mounting crisis, continuously gearing up to fight a battle we are losing country-wide."
20469,"She said the praise and support they were getting in the spring was amazing, but after a while, they would simply prefer people take action to stop the pandemic."
20470,"“We were all like ‘I don’t care about food, don’t care about snacks.’ What we want and what we need is for people to wear their masks, to be responsible to socially distance, because we cant keep doing this!”

Working long hours is taking a toll, but Paik said it was the emotional burdens that seem to weight the most, and keep her from falling asleep."
20471,"“We are tired of our beds filling up,” Paik explained."
20472,“We are tired of watching people die.
20473,"We are also tired of hearing family members say ‘Isn’t there anything else you can do?’ and for us to say ‘no.’”

Paik explained what we’ve known for a while; there is no easy fix to this right now, even with all our medical advances."
20474,"“There is not a cure for COVID-19, there is supportive care we can do for COVID-19, but there is no cure for it,” Paik adds."
20475,"“So I think that is part of the confusion when people say ‘I don’t understand, you are doing all of these things, why isn’t my family member being better?’ Well, all we are doing is trying to support your family member’s own immune system!"
20476,"There is no super medication that just comes in and eradicates COVID-19 like that.”

While we run out of space to put infected people statewide, Paik sees our medical workers inside those ICU rooms, helping families say their final goodbyes over an iPad."
20477,"“Our bedside nurses are holding these tablets and they are giving the patient the kiss or the hug for the family members…the family member can’t be there to do that,” Paik said."
20478,"“That is really hard to come to work and do every day.”

If you’d like to take a moment to thank a healthcare worker by sending them a short message online, you can do that [here](https://www.uchealth.org/saythankyou)."

20482,That in no way means no threat.

20510,"I haven't questioned the data (would be stupid to do so before they share it), even less impliying that anyone has been cheating with them."
20511,This just can come from a lack of reading comprehension.
20512,I've just critized the communication strategy (which is something that in a crysis of this proportions should be specially be taken into account).
20513,"I've even said that I believe that if the data had shown worse (not better) results over those days, I think they wouldn't have make a public statement about it."
20514,"So, this criticism would be more focused on Pfeizer, not Moderna."
20515,"I haven't said anything specifically about Moderna, so your accusations are nonsensical."
20516,What I actually think is that Pfeizer's announcement triggered Moderna's one.
20517,"Maybe not, but that's definetely the impression it gives from the outside, which from my Pov of doesn't look too good."
20518,"I'm not questioning the data, I'm questioning the fact of playing with expectations instead of taking a more prudent approach."
20519,"They have been speaking about dates (which is something that is not fully in their hands as these hasn't yet been approved) and even making some reckless statements about when we would be 'back to normal' (which is an idea that clashes with the efforts of so many people, institutions and governments to insist on not being too overconfident yet)."
20520,I'm obviously referring to this.
20521,The point has been pretty clear from the start.
20522,I don't have the impression you have any interest at in starting a dialogue and I won't get pissed off because you call me an 'ignorant' (is that welcome in this thread?
20523,I can see you've edited your comment but you said what you said.
20524,"If this is wrong enough to change it, I guess the honest thing would have been to apologize too) but I won't accept any kind of threats."

20668,I think you are misunderstanding what the article is saying.
20669,They are talking about the chances of someone at your thanksgiving dinner having covide as a function of how many are outside your household.
20670,"From the article:

&gt; So you’ve downsized your Thanksgiving celebration and instead of 25 people, it’s down to 10."
20671,&gt; What are the chances somebody at the dinner table has coronavirus?
20672,"&gt; More than 41% for a 10-person Thanksgiving gathering in Grand Rapids or Muskegon, based on calculations by researchers at the Georgia Institute for Technology."
20673,"&gt; About one in three for an dinner held in Saginaw; one in four in Kalamazoo, and one in five for Ann Arbor or Detroit, those researchers estimate."
20674,"&gt; Bump the number to 20 people in attendance and the odds go up to 65% in Kent County, 59% in Saginaw, 44% in Kalamazoo and 35% in Washtenaw County."
20675,They are talking about having 25 people over for dinner vs. having 10 people over for dinner.
20676,"Then, they make assumptions about the size of a family (of those 10 people, how many are in your household?"
20677,How many different households were invited over?)
20678,etc.
20679,....and ignored by the millions of travelers

20685,Does that apply to the whole bubble system?
20686,Like I’ve got three friends that I see regularly.
20687,We only see each other regularly.
20688,"Three of us work at home, one works at a school but is super serious about precautions."
20689,When we hang out we don’t mask up.
20690,Is that not advisable?
20691,How isn't it?
20692,We all gave up and did things like open gyms and the inside of restaurant (when we KNOW that poor ventilation is a pretty big culprit!)
20693,instead of just paying those workers to stay home.
20694,We fought wearing masks inside when AGAIN we know poor ventilation and enclosed spaces are a big way this spreads.
20695,These are mistakes we could've rectified back in May but we deliberately chose not to.
20696,"We should feel guilty and ashamed of the trauma healthcare workers have to deal with now that they are triaging care, doing things like ""the pit"" in El Paso, and not even giving them extra money to cope with the trauma of watching people die *painfully* multiple times a shift."

20704,"Both systems are fully corrupted, but that still does not take away from their origins."

20722,My guess is highly inaccurate data coming out of the country.
20723,"No country TRULY has a handle on how widespread this is and a lot of cases get missed, but I suspect this is especially true of India."
20724,"They really don't even know their own population, much less how many people have gotten this and how many have died."
20725,The tens or hundreds of millions of Indians living in slums aren't going to get tested for COVID and the government isn't going to know if they pass away.
20726,Wishing for this is dangerous.
20727,Eventually YouTube will start banning and demonetizing their stuff you agree with.

20739,"I mean when they announced the first vaccine, people went ""we're all clear"" and started booking tickets to see Grandma for Thanksgiving."
20740,They seemed to think it was over before we even had an idea when it would be rolled out.
20741,Yes masks are mandatory and there're fines for failing to do so.
20742,"There were a few arrests and imprisonments of persons who turned disorderly or violent when asked to wear masks, but not for not wearing masks per se."
20743,"Fun fact, spreading fake information and hysteria about COVID-19 also results in jail."
20744,I think like coronaviruses go...this is highly contagious indoors in winter months especially.
20745,Antibodies seen in 90% of patients at 28 days.
20746,Bad.
20747,How about 3 months?
20748,6 months?
20749,90% will decrease to 80%-60% or worse.
20750,Do we take this vaccine every 3 months?
20751,How about supply?
20752,There’s only a couple hundred thousands doses and 300 million in the US.
20753,We use all the supply and in a few months it all comes back?

20777,And within I don't know 6 weeks there were spikes and then the lockdown and now there is a reduction in cases.
20778,I will say -- two of my favorite work colleagues have been sick with Covid for more than 5 months.

20794,This is the most insane argument I’ve ever heard.

20914,I have a coworker with her bachelor's and twenty years of experience on me who told me she's not getting vaccinated because it's going to be microchipped so the government can track you.

20948,Recently he has gone against the state of California hard about the covid shut downs and basically turned into a right wing loon.
20949,Previously he would pretty much be neutral but now he has joined the anti mask anti science movement and has shit tons of people on to support that angle.

20965,"Given he was febrile, and that it was a go no-go decision for now or never (see discussion above), I agree with the decision to give the Regeneron mab cocktail."

20998,"These are nursing home residents, cancer patients, etc."

21188,Then deal with all the other crap.
21189,But they are trying to load these bills with a whole lot of other crap to take advantage of the emergency and they are putting their own interests above the American people.

21323,For that you would have had 60+ % of the populace infected with the virus in the first place.

21470,"Spreading that shit is what harms discourse, just look at antivaccination!!!"
21471,"There's no ""beating them with better discourse"" they just make up bullshit and then specifically target groups of people who they know aren't highly educated!"
21472,"This literally happened in my town, antivax groups specifically spread disinformation to new East African immigrants about vaccines because they *knew* that it would be easy to influence a lot of them, because they were coming from a society with less developed public health and education infrastructure."

21591,"I mean a ban on outdoor dining, really?"
21592,All over the Western World patio season was in full swing this summer and cases continued to drop off.

21599,And gets an Emmy.
21600,Go figure.
21601,Perhaps I should have added Covid to specifically reference that.
21602,I do understand that you need to get certain vaccinations when you are traveling to other countries.
21603,"But, I am sorry, the data for coronavirus makes no sense."
21604,The movements that are coming behind the guise of coronavirus are fucking alarming.
21605,I can see that you’re eager to skew the info to fit whatever conclusion you want to reach.

21609,I have no idea what state my immune system is in after years of chemo.
21610,I'm hoping my oncologists will be able to give some guidance.

21621,There were at least two red flags he's not a rational person...
21622,"No, I doubt this is a failure of messaging."
21623,There isn’t a single soul in America who hasn’t heard about the benefits of mask wearing or at least seen people wear masks.
21624,This is polarization and anti-science taken to its logical extreme.
21625,I have deep sympathy for those who have lost their lives due to Covid but at the same time I have close family members with comorbidities who refuse to wear masks.
21626,When your entire community is anti-Covid then this happens.

21661,It makes me so sad that we are unnecessarily subjecting our healthcare workers to this trauma.
21662,"Collectively as a nation, we are *completely* taking them for granted."
21663,Someone did a map of our infection rates and overlaid it with a map of areas where the majority of voters voted for 45.
21664,Guess what?
21665,They’re was a correlation.
21666,and they ended up no worse than anyone else really.
21667,their economy fared slightly better than their neighbours and their deaths were slightly higher.
21668,I know.
21669,But people saying it doesn't make it true.
21670,To a certain extend I am aware of both good and bad things in both models.
21671,"It is just in a context of democracy like Singapore, people in the east still prone to choose respecting the authority, democracy or not, their choices are quite the same."
21672,"So if the end result is quite the same (a single ruling party), why smashing up things that have been built in decades for a political model that will likely to operate in quite the same manners?"
21673,"SEOUL, South Korea — The deaths were mounting, and so were the public’s fears."
21674,"South Korea had vastly expanded its flu vaccine program to cover millions more people, to prevent a one-two punch to its health system as the coronavirus spread globally."
21675,"But as the injections got underway, reports of deaths started popping up."
21676,South Korean scientists quickly determined that the deaths were unrelated to the flu shots.
21677,"But they worried that if they didn’t stop the panic, the public might shun the vaccines altogether."
21678,"So health officials doubled down — and, in the process, gave the world a game plan for when coronavirus vaccines become widely available."
21679,They ramped up efforts to communicate with the public.
21680,They disclosed data on what was found.
21681,"And they quickly got the vaccination campaign back on track, at a time when scientists dealing with Covid-19 are increasingly worried about the rise of the anti-vaccine movement."
21682,"“S
outh Korea is doing everything right,” said Dr. Noel T. Brewer, a professor in the health behavior department at the Gillings School of Global Public Health at the University of North Carolina."
21683,"“The government is gathering data, giving information to the public quickly and standing up for their vaccination program."
21684,"That will ensure public trust, and help the program.”

As pharmaceutical makers rush to get a coronavirus vaccine approved, countries around the world are grappling with how to safely and quickly distribute hundreds of millions of doses."
21685,"Already, the pandemic has created confusion and distrust in an era when misinformation can spread rapidly — all of which could complicate the global effort toward immunity."
21686,"If a long-proven, extensively tested flu shot can spark uncertainty and concern, it could portend challenges for mass inoculations of a brand-new coronavirus vaccine."
21687,The potential pitfalls played out on a small scale in South Korea.
21688,"The country’s ambitious flu vaccine campaign began on Sept. 8, a month earlier than usual."
21689,"Health officials announced plans to inoculate 30 million people, 10 million more than last year."
21690,"But in their haste, problems arose."
21691,A company hired to transport millions of doses of the vaccine had never carried such large quantities of cargo before.
21692,"The flu vaccines need to stay refrigerated, at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius."
21693,"On Sept. 21, photos began circulating online showing boxes of vaccines stacked outdoors, in a parking lot."
21694,"Out of an abundance of caution, the government temporarily suspended the program to investigate."
21695,"On Oct. 6, it concluded that the vaccines were still safe, but nevertheless recalled the 480,000 doses that had been left outside long enough to potentially become ineffective."
21696,"Three days later, 615,000 doses of a vaccine shipped by another company were also recalled, after white particles were found inside."
21697,The government concluded they were harmless protein particles.
21698,"A notice at a hospital in Sejong, South Korea, announcing the suspension of the flu vaccine program in September."

21781,Yup.
21782,If things are forced its human nature to go against it.
21783,The replacing ice cream with ice cream I can’t eat got me good.
21784,"I got 3 pints of my favorite flavor, cherry Garcia... but I couldn’t eat them without ruining my night XD

It was worth it."
21785,My sister was on deployment last year for both thanksgiving and christmas.
21786,Something to think about for all the service members and their families
21787,Do you think Trump fucked it up?
21788,How many people do you think should have died thus far?
21789,Which none of the people who got the 'rona will actually line up to take.
21790,It'll take restrictions and fines to get these patriots to line up.
21791,it might not be ridiculous but an IFR of 0.3% with most of the deaths coming from people in their 80s is not a particularly high either.
21792,Seems a forgone conclusion; why not move the meeting up a week?
21793,I’ll never understand the selfishness
21794,Don't have a sister.
21795,🤷‍♂️
21796,I still find it hard to believe the numbers coming out of China.
21797,Without a vaccine it seems impossible to only have 5 cases per day.
21798,Dentist here.
21799,I'm in close proximity to unmasked people all day every day.
21800,There is no way you can source accurate data on this.
21801,"&gt;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.22.389056v1

&gt;Explain this then?"
21802,Look at Figure 2D for those with asymptomatic/mild disease (i.e.
21803,the majority of cases) for the frequency of long term neutralizers.
21804,"Look at Figure 3 for an analysis showing a downward trend in anti-RBD, anti-nucleocapsid, and anti-S2 abs."
21805,And Figure 3d shows numerous individuals falling below the neutralization threshold.
21806,"&gt;https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)31565-831565-8)

The Crotty paper that this article refers to extends the data out to 6 months."
21807,"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.15.383323v1.full.pdf  Like the Cell paper you reference, there is a rise in immunity up to 3 months."
21808,Guess what?
21809,Then it plateaus and starts to descend.
21810,"Additionally, if you look at Figure 4C and 4E, you'll see a large percentage of the population that was unable to inhibit 50% of RBD binding to ACE2 indicating lack of neutralization at either visit 1 or visit 2."
21811,"&gt;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.22.389056v2.full.pdf

This is the first paper you posted..."
21812,"Yes, look at 3D."
21813,Look at the percent of the population that drops below the neutralization level or is decreasing.
21814,This is not impressive data that instills confidence.
21815,The data is driven higher by a few samples with large increases in neutralization.
21816,These aren't the people that I'm concerned about as I've never claimed that reinfection was going to be an issue for everybody.
21817,What I am concerned about (as are most scientists) is the number of people that immunity wanes below the level necessary to prevent reinfection.
21818,"The more data that comes out, the greater that number appears to be getting."
21819,And these studies that you are showing don't support a stance that immunity is somehow increasing.
21820,It shows it decreasing and in a larger number of people than the original Wuhan studies that showed between 3-7% of hospitalized individuals that didn't develop neutralizing antibodies after 1 month.
21821,"&gt;Also, please put that ego away."
21822,it's disgusting and unfitting.
21823,Did you get these studies from COVID-19?
21824,Were they not able to critically analyze them or compare them to previous or new research?
21825,Hmmm.
21826,"I wonder why...

&gt;Edit: I took a peek at your posting history."
21827,"Spicy, very much so."
21828,"I guess you dont go to r/COVID19 for other reasons, but let's not step down to that level just yet."
21829,"I'm sorry, but who are you?"
21830,Does it look like I care about your meaningless opinions?
21831,Nope.
21832,I only care about the science.
21833,"But, it doesn't appear that you can step up to the plate with that."
21834,Very disappointing.
21835,Fedex sucks for residential.
21836,"I don’t care if people do, I do care if they try to keep shaming people for not wearing masks."

21839,"you must live/have lived in cleveland...as someone who lives in ohio too, cleveland sucks

columbus is barely passable"
21840,Staten Island is Trumplandia so I'm not surprised.
21841,Highest positivity area in NYC.
21842,Most people in Sweden benefitted from the strategy though by living with less restrictions.
21843,"You sir, are a complete moron and have absolutely no idea what you’re talking about in regards to RN schools, exams and licensure."

21918,Al hospital leadership has said so far is that it will announce a plan once its approved and they have look over all of the results.
21919,"Edit: Apparently nursing home residents, but I still think it makes sense to have the nurses get it first."
21920,[removed]
21921,Yep it's been out for a while now.
21922,That sadly will drag down the people of the state who do believe it is real.
21923,Thanks for raising more awareness about this.
21924,"The long term health problems (physical and neurological) are one of the biggest concerns IMO, especially for those who otherwise have a high survival rate."
21925,Can’t speak specifically for vaccine distribution but most stuff that gets stored at -80C is shipped on dry ice.
21926,Same at mine.
21927,"Nobody respects social distancing, tons of people walking around without masks (my state has a mask mandate, mind you)."
21928,And they started doing samples again last week.
21929,You could probably find both of those things on Amazon but probably more expensive
21930,"Meanwhile, ""personal responsibility"" Mike Parson continues to do nothing."

21932,"No, it doesn't stop you from getting or even spreading it."
21933,"It should reduce your chances of getting it drastically, by 90% according to Moderna and Pfizer."
21934,"However, you need multiple doses, and more than likely annually in the future"
21935,You are stating a lot of speculation as if they were facts.
21936,"Hummm interesting approach, keep in mind though these are only recommendations and no plan is finalized (per."
21937,The article).
21938,"Theoretically this could be a very effective way of stopping the spread, but only time will tell."
21939,Already knew this about a month ago.
21940,"An internal email from my workplace said that the vaccines would be rolled out to certain companies' employees first, and before you get in a panic about favoritism, I process at least a hundred customers a day."
21941,If you want to reduce the chance of super spreader events it's just simple logic to reduce potential contagion vectors.
21942,"So yes, your Walmart cashier gets the vaccine before you."
21943,He also deals with how many more people on the daily?
21944,It makes sense.
21945,I should also mention I don't work for Walmart
21946,Australia is an island with .08% of the population of America.

21953,But don't sit and take shit all the time either.
21954,Bingo
21955,Apparently a lot of this sub does because I see a lot of people talking about not going out for 8 months on here.
21956,I also think it’s certainly possible to not get within 6 feet of a high risk individual for some people.
21957,Especially on a college campus.

21962,"My mom is terrified at the idea, and I don't think I comforted her much by saying i'll take one for the team."
21963,Yeah we can easily expect 2500+ deaths reported tomorrow.
21964,"But with thanksgiving literally this week, I have no idea how this will impact the reporting of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths from the coronavirus through the end of this week and into next week, especially as the protocols in reporting are surely to be different from state to state."
21965,"If I had to guess, I wouldn't be surprised to see a massive drop in covid deaths and cases late this week with a massive spike sometime mid to late next week balancing this out."
21966,"In any rate, the numbers in the 2 weeks leading up into Christmas and New Years are going to be straight from a horror movie."
21967,Yup.
21968,I work on the scientific side of biotech/biopharma and I don’t think I’ve ever worked anywhere that didn’t have -80s.
21969,Not sure about using college campuses.
21970,Maybe bigger universities?
21971,But I remember at my small undergrad we had like... maybe two -80s for the entire college.
21972,"Versus my current lab that has two just for the 8 of us in my group, with probably 20 or more in my building...out of like 10 buildings at my company."
21973,A moving average smooths out the noise and adds a delay to changes in the signal.
21974,7 days is a good window for the general calendar because it smooths the under-reporting over the weekend.
21975,"With a 4 day holiday, over half of the sample data is going to be under-reported."
21976,"A 14 day average would be less susceptible to noise, but adds an even larger delay to the signal."
21977,If protecting your workers from a deadly pandemic happens to be a shrewd business practice that's fine by me.
21978,It won't.
21979,Catholics have been ignoring the stuff the pope says that they don't like for as long as there's been a pope.

21981,Buy em cheap and rent them out
21982,5000 a day within 3 weeks at this rate
21983,People who go on cruises are exactly the type to also go on cruises during a pandemic.
21984,My understanding is that Sweden has strange constitutional laws that severely impacted how they could respond to it.
21985,"&gt; While many countries imposed nationwide lockdowns and curfews, such measures were prohibited by the Swedish constitution as it is considered to be a violation of people's freedom of movement,[85] and Swedish laws on communicable diseases (Smittskyddslagen) only allow for quarantining individuals and small areas such as buildings, not for entire geographical areas."
21986,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Sweden

So i give the government a break on it at least."
21987,"That comment was just a fact, but I think it’s clear this sub thinks I think it’s low."
21988,"(and they’re not wrong)

That said I honestly thought it would be a higher percentage, and 20% struck me as low."
21989,It's not that it can't be eradicated.
21990,It's that it won't be worth it in the near future.
21991,[removed]
21992,&gt; so the rest of us are going to have to get shot up every few months.
21993,Do you have any sources for this?
21994,"Seems like if the anti vaxxer shitheads continue to be viral reservoirs, the rate of spread (and mutation) should drop to a fraction of what it is now, and having to re-inoculate everyone every few months shouldn't be a large issue."
21995,Unfortunately how polite someone is has nothing to with with whether or not they are a good person.
21996,Why bother.
21997,You can be a good person without it.
21998,Oh right - that's true.
21999,The reason is because every year the vaccine producers (or maybe the WHO or something) take a stab at figuring out which strains will be prevalent.. and they aren't always right.
22000,"Sometimes they nail it and those vaccinated are good to go, sometimes they get it wrong and the vaccine is effectively worthless."
22001,How does that compare to a flu vaccine being $40 with no insurance?
22002,Mechanics plus injection of something to prevent a sickness for less than half the price of a swab to test if you have a sickness?
22003,Makes zero sense to me.
22004,Papr.
22005,"Best and most comfortable use of your funds for respiratory safety, plus bonus face shield."
22006,Go with organic vapor cartridges for it and you won’t even smell the foulest halitosis.
22007,"No vaccine has been approved yet, they've just demonstrated very high efficacy."
22008,They'll be given limited approval likely in December in most western countries.
22009,All we need is more Good People with guns.
22010,Everywhere.
22011,"More armed people, what could go wrong?"
22012,"It’s not like there are shitty people out there who could get a weapons and do something dangerous, right?"
22013,True - and several of them are 90+% effective.
22014,BUT...
22015,"It's going to take time to manufacturer, distribute, and administer them, so it is going to be months until their effect is really felt."
22016,"And considering we are about to hit Thanksgiving and Christmas, the hospitals are going to get hit with a massive surge of cases long before the vaccines come into play."
22017,Getting our shit together involves so much more than vaccines and masks though.
22018,Like starting to treat the underlying pathologies in our systems and practices.
22019,Sadly I think we’ll end up just fire fighting instead.
22020,Healthcare AI Architect here.
22021,That’s the point though isn’t it?
22022,Scale repetitive processes that require a sharp eye so a doctor working 100 hours a week doesn’t have to do it?
22023,You make these models functional to humans so they can stop doing repetitive work and instead do valuable work.
22024,"Keep skirting around the facts that long term effects won't be known until, ya know, time passes."
22025,I don't understand why any healthy individual (the majority of people) would willingly become a long term test subject on a virus that has a 99.9% recovery for said individuals.

22036,Some said it helped with deadlier versions and the articles were all overlapping with one another.

22087,A qtip up the nose to test if you have something is 113...but a vaccine that is injected inside you and prevents a sickness (flu shot) runs about 40 dollars.
22088,"Wow, 1:1000 really puts it in perspective."
22089,We’re headed that direction pretty quick now at 260K deaths out of 330 million.
22090,"They do deserve another chance, but those types of idiots are still there unfortunately"

22101,Uh I've gotten those shots before but still got the flu....I know people who got the flu even with those shots.
22102,"""There are not enough of them, nor likely stocks of dry ice for shipping vaccines to so many different places where they will be needed."""
22103,From the same article he linked...but what do a bunch of doctors who run and work at the hospitals know.
22104,Clearly all these people making an issue out of it are part of the fake news propaganda and helped steal the election for Biden while working with the Russians and terrorists.
22105,Sorry I probably missed a conspiracy theory in there somewhere.

22113,"This delay isn't fixed, it varies day by day."
22114,I believe the reports for Tuesday tend to be lower because the day before hospitals are dealing with administrative catching up after the weekend.
22115,This leads to Wednesday being higher because it sort of aggregates the numbers.
22116,Every single randomized controlled study and meta analysis say that masks do not work.
22117,The studies you're going to cite to support masks are all recent observational and mechanistic studies which are basically a joke in science.
22118,Yawn
22119,"Well, history is written by the winners."
22120,"Oh, I take all precautions, and expect to continue masking up into 2022."
22121,I might trust these vaccines after 1 year.
22122,You have a fundamental misunderstanding of a publisher vs. a platform.
22123,Publishers can be held liable for the content they publish.
22124,This is why you can sue a newspaper for publishing libelous content.
22125,Platforms do not have that.
22126,You can’t sue YouTube for something a user uploads to their platform.
22127,That’s why publishers can choose what they publish.
22128,Big tech fought for this legal protection.
22129,"Now YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook are editorializing content uploaded to their platforms, thus violating the law that they fought to have passed."
22130,This is why so many people are upset at these tech companies.
22131,"&gt; If what you're saying is true, it ought to be true of publisher's as well."
22132,Is it true for publishers?
22133,No.
22134,Not at all.
22135,They are two separate things.
22136,You need to first understand this.
22137,I apologize if I’m not explaining it well.
22138,My dad was loving the senior only hours but since the numbers are going up (and he has COPD) he’s learned how to order his groceries online from the Costco app!
22139,"Which I’m happy about, I really don’t want him going out if he can help it."
22140,I think they even paired with Instacart for 2 hour delivery?
22141,Don’t quote me on that but I know he orders his stuff in the app and has it delivered.
22142,There's the virus and there's the disease.
22143,You will always contract the virus.
22144,It's not as if the virus particles will bounce of your skin.
22145,"The coronavirus causes a disease, Covid-19."
22146,The disease is what the vaccine is for.
22147,Your body will know how to fight that disease after you get the vaccine but you might still have symptoms or still be infectious.
22148,Other non-vaccinated people will still be around you because full population rollout just takes a lot of time.
22149,I really dont know whats wrong with a Chinese defending China
22150,Xinjiang is not in Mongolia.
22151,Why do you keep insisting in putting them in another country?
22152,Yeah.
22153,I’ve seen how vile humans can be through this dark time.
22154,These are the very first mRNA vaccines to ever be approved - ever.
22155,This is the first time humanity has ever tried them at scale.
22156,"Nothing in medicine is guaranteed, especially brand new tech."
22157,"I will get A vaccine, just not the first ones."
22158,I’m waiting for the one currently in production which relies on old school tech.
22159,"I can’t remember the name, but it uses a tried and true vaccine delivery method (instead of one never before attempted at scale in human beings) against a well known target that has been used before in other types of coronavirus vaccines with success."
22160,I drive a Honda instead of a Tesla because I value reliability above all else.
22161,"I’m strongly pro-vaccine - I’m a veterinarian and I’ve given tens of thousands of vaccines, if not hundreds of thousands."
22162,I get the flu vaccine and boostered tetanus last year when I got bit by a cat.
22163,I got the meningitis vaccine and HPV.
22164,"I’ve even been vaccinated for Rabies, twice, and that one induces a stronger immune reaction and the site was sore for days and the vaccine itself hurts."
22165,Don’t you dare call me anti-vaccine.
22166,I know enough about them to make an informed decision.
22167,We’ve never had the option to choose between multiple vaccines before.
22168,Vets do when they decide which brands to buy for their clinic.
22169,Pharma companies thought a kennel cough vaccine would be easier to give as a squirt in the nose.
22170,"Turns out, in practice dogs absolutely hate it, almost universally, and it’s more dangerous to give than a shot because you’re right up in their face."
22171,Aggressive dogs get the injectable version (you can’t inject the nasal version and it’s bad if you do).
22172,"It sounded great, and I’m sure things went reasonably well in clinical trials, but in practice it was a disaster."
22173,"Medical tech is never, ever guaranteed."
22174,I’ve also been practicing long enough to have seen a drug touted as safe end up being dangerous.
22175,"Metacam (meloxicam/mobic in people) was promised to be safe, but it ended up killing tons of cats by severely injuring their kidneys."
22176,I’ve personally injured a cat with another injectable NSAID because neither I nor the owner knew the cat had kidney disease and the single injection at the normal dose was enough to make the kidney disease symptomatic.
22177,You never regain lost kidney function; it can’t heal like other organs.
22178,"I have YEARS of clinical experience that has guided me, like many many other veterinarians, to be cautious with new medical technology."
22179,We are still scared of Proheart (injectable heartworm medicine) even though it hasn’t been dangerous for many years.
22180,The old version caused a lot of fatal reactions and killed our patients.
22181,This was before I graduated and it has since been reformulated and is safe to give now.
22182,"I’ve given it to hundreds of animals, and it has gone well every single time, and adverse events are rare now, but once bitten twice shy."
22183,I am cautious because I’ve been burned by the pharmaceutical industry.
22184,"I also haven’t forgotten how fucked up it is that they charge so much for essential life saving drugs like insulin, which other countries find abhorrent."
22185,They have price gouged the fuck out of the US and all of us suffer as a result.
22186,People DIE when they can’t afford basic medication.
22187,Big pharma is responsible for a shit ton of death.
22188,"They aren’t our majestic, infallible benefactors and they don’t act for the good of all mankind."
22189,They are motivated by money and I don’t trust anyone who is happy to let people die rather than decrease their fucking insane profits.

22199,So much better than many European countries!
22200,It sounds like one of the stats thrown about by a certain someone pointing out how great a job he's been doing.
22201,Freon and heavy metal supplies are usually produced by traded companies.
22202,The article talks about specific counties.
22203,"Also, correct me if I'm wrong here, but for some quick napkin math: we're at about 13 million cases."
22204,"For a population of 330 million, that means 3.9% of Americans have had a positive test."
22205,"But some states have it worse than others, some counties have it worse than others."
22206,It doesn't seem far fetched that some counties are at 5%.
22207,"The article says:

&gt; More than 41% for a 10-person Thanksgiving gathering in Grand Rapids or Muskegon, based on calculations by researchers at the Georgia Institute for Technology."
22208,"&gt; About one in three for an dinner held in Saginaw; one in four in Kalamazoo, and one in five for Ann Arbor or Detroit, those researchers estimate."
22209,"&gt; Bump the number to 20 people in attendance and the odds go up to 65% in Kent County, 59% in Saginaw, 44% in Kalamazoo and 35% in Washtenaw County."
22210,"So as a spot check, I see Muskegon at 4,458 per 100k, pretty close to 1 in 20."
22211,"I disagree with your points B and C. If we're around 5% and we need 70% for herd immunity, that implies something like 2 or 3 million people dead."
22212,"And maybe the disease sucks at spreading because people have been working from home, wearing masks, etc?"
22213,"yeah, like how you would call an American ""anti-American"" if he or she goes against American values."
22214,Your intelligence is something I wouldn't strive for
22215,That’s where I live...oh god I need to be careful
22216,Have there been any incidences like this in Canada?
22217,I know multiple have been murdered here in the states for asking to comply to wear a mask and many more attacked (like this guy).
22218,This reminds me of World War II.
22219,"In times of crisis, when there's essentially infinite funding and tons of focus, huge scientific and technological leaps can be made."
22220,Imagine how far medicine could have already gone if we paid this much attention all the time.
22221,This past year has essentially been like the Manhattan Project of vaccine development
22222,I compared Sweden with it's two neighbors...  the only countries bordering it.
22223,I'm not sure how that is cherry picking.
22224,"If anything, it is more accurate to compare Sweden to the other Nordic countries than it would be to compare it to Italy or Spain."
22225,Those countries have different climates and cultures and so don't offer nearly as direct comparison of lockdown vs non-lockdown approach.
22226,And you believe conspiracy theories.
22227,You must be extra dumb.
22228,"You said:

22232,"Not physically, but just in general abusive."
22233,"So, one way or another the wife's brother found out, decided to confront the husband, and the brother got himself shot and killed."
22234,"It was on the husband's property, so, last I knew, he has yet to face any serious consequences."
22235,"His property, he can easily say the brother was trespassing and that he, the property owner, was acting in self-defense."

22294,You know damn will the elites and celebrities will find a way to get their shots first before the people who need it the most.
22295,Don’t be so naive!
22296,There will already be logistical issues delivering the vaccine to rural areas so the last thing we need is someone saying we all need to take the vaccine immediately.

22336,Why is this downvoted so heavily?

22338,And are constantly changing/sanitizing that PPE
22339,Not all.
22340,Countries crushing covid is good news.
22341,Vaccine news are good news.
22342,I wish politicians gave out concrete criteria for when they can lift mask mandates.
22343,"For example, if 50% of the population is vaccinated and infection rates are low, mandates are repealed."
22344,Never?
22345,"You will have mitigation, but getting everyone vaccinated repeatedly to achieve real and constant herd immunity is not going to happen globally."
22346,The outbreaks will just get very small and manageable.
22347,These vaccines will wear off and the virus will still be out there somewhere.
22348,Less people will get vaccinated over time and there will be another outbreak.
22349,That seems like the most likely scenario.
22350,"Over time perhaps it will mutate toward less lethality like a common cold, but I think it will remain just one more problem the world has, not unlike the flu, just consistently worse than almost any flu strain, but also genetically stable so maybe easier to eradicate/treat long term."
22351,"I mean, what's the point in using the term herd immunity for short term immunity?"
22352,That doesn't make sense.
22353,"When we normally talk about herd immunity we are talking about viruses that produce long term immunity, like measles's or chickenpox or even a specific flu strain."
22354,"I have only seen claims these vaccine will produce short term immunity, maybe a year, maybe more, hopefully not less."
22355,"However not everyone will get it and the rollout to some parts of the world might take a long time or never happen, so the virus will be around somewhere doing it's thing in large enough populations to most likely stay around."
22356,"It would be different if the vaccine lasted a long time and you could get like 70% of people vaccinated, but even 30% leaves a lot of people to host the virus while the other people's vaccines wear off and they don't all get re-vaccinated."
22357,So there will be an always on pool of people the virus can recirculate through and that pool will grow over time from the initial vaccination point because you will only get less people vaccinated over time as the threat decline to the point they look at it more like the flu.
22358,"Flu vaccination rates in America are pretty low, so I kind of expect COVID vaccinations to decline over the years to levels closer to the flu levels since a big reason people don't get the flu vaccinate is because it doesn't caused major outbreaks that scare people that often."
22359,THEN when it does all of a sudden they want vaccinations more.
22360,"People will do the same with COVID, they will drop their guard and stop getting vaccinated."
22361,Hopefully the virus will mutate away from lethality and just be an infectious annoyance or get eradicated by a better vaccinate or dumb luck.
22362,I think those are all more likely than sustained herd immunity for years through constant vaccination... though people will still claim herd immunity weather they really achieve it or not.
22363,"It just has to not be reported in the news a lot and they will call it herd immunity I suspect, but the virus will still be out and about causing small outbreaks which mostly go under the radar."
22364,"Just nuke everything, that'll stop the pesky virus."
22365,Then the next virus to plague the earth will be this community!

22376,"Apparently schools are a significant source of spread for every disease EXCEPT covid, remarkable."
22377,"Speaking as a parent, my kid was bringing something home every month to infect us before."
22378,Since doing the online schooling since April not even a sniffle.
22379,"Roughly 10% in our district are actually sending their kids to school, and we got an email last week notifying parents of a confirmed case within that group and where to get tested if concerned..."
22380,Nope.
22381,Unemployment is not the issue.
22382,I am sure that the cast majority of these medical professionals aren't thinking about how much unemployment people are getting.
22383,You know what they're thinking about?
22384,The vast disconnect between the death and suffering they deal with at work and the entitled bitching they hear from somebody who doesn't like the way a piece of cloth feels against their cheeks.
22385,These are folks who shove tubes down people's throats just to keep air moving.
22386,Maybe they're thinking about shoving a tube down this entitled prick's throat.
22387,I don't know.
22388,Some people laugh just so they don't cry
22389,Man the Midwest is gonna be screwed
22390,YouTube doesn’t publish anything.
22391,Its users do.
22392,How do you not understand this?
22393,It’s good for everyone because then you can have an open exchange of ideas.
22394,What you are advocating is the silencing of ideas on a platform because you are too lazy to counter those ideas with well thought out arguments.
22395,You are literally arguing for the dumbing down of discourse.
22396,I think at this point it's pretty precedented
22397,Did you just call the Catholic Pope anti-Catholic?
22398,If mental gymnastics was a sport you'd be the spokesperson for Nike.
22399,I’m praying Biden’s admin will cement a national definition of “essential worker.” My state let any business except bars and restaurants declare themselves “essential” and issue their own exemption from shelter in place letters.
22400,"Workplaces are allowed by health departments to be exempt from social distancing if “the employee’s work cannot be accomplished with social distancing.” 

It’s insane and should be getting us shut down."
22401,How tragic
22402,"I'll start showing optimism once he starts turning in all the church pedos, until then he's nothing more to me than PR for the church to get on the good side of youth these days"
22403,Wow.
22404,That's amazing.
22405,I've been surprised also by how easily small children adapt to masks
22406,Great points.
22407,"Regarding the last one, Itd be helpful to track how many people are *denied* hospitalizations due to max capacity."
22408,But at that point hospitals/ICUs would be so overwhelmed with triaging that it’d be difficult to actively track that metric and coordinate that reporting accurately between hospitals.
22409,I guess we’ll know when death rates skyrocket :(
22410,El barfo
22411,No.
22412,Because rich people are going to take this vaccine.
22413,Especially the famous.
22414,And they'll get it first.
22415,"You give it to essential workers because it makes sense, not because you're testing it on the poor."
22416,"Stop offering nonsense conspiracy theories you thought of on a whim, it's not good for you or anyone else."
22417,Cherry picking comparisons?
22418,Really?
22419,I get that they're similar countries but it's really not fair to go about it that way.
22420,"Compare Sweden to other European countries, including those with strict lockdowns."
22421,No!
22422,"Don't preach that here.. Common sense has left in 2020, from both sides."
22423,"One isn't wearing masks and is angry, the other is telling them to wear a mask making them even more angry."
22424,"They used to tell me in the army, don't be a hero"
22425,mRNA vaccines have been in testing for a decade though
22426,Cancer is a nightmare but donating the tissue made me feel that at least it could help other people.
22427,I know that people who came before me helped to make my treatment a reality.
22428,"true, but most folks who use Patreon or like-minded sites or apps, and make content on YouTube - are decent folks, and create a lot of good content."
22429,You shouldn’t feel scummy for helping these good folks make a living.
22430,We all have to eat.
22431,"Being a newly diagnosed covid patient in Colorado, this terrifies me"
22432,There's no justification for lying.
22433,"That said, whether he lied or not makes no difference as to whether we should wear mask or not"
22434,"Too soon to say it’s turned over, I don’t think you realize hospitalization #s have a lag, if you’re following the graphs in “real time” the most current week always shows a downtrend until #s are added back in later as the data comes in."

22442,I think the reporter is using latex gloves as a catch all term.
22443,"Looking at the company's website, they make nitrile and vinyl gloves too."
22444,It was a joke.
22445,"This very question was asked of Dr. Michael Osterholm (now on the Biden task force) and he said, just speaking as himself and not for any administration or organization, that he would accept the likely immunity of a family member who had been PCR-positive in the last couple months as a Christmas present, and go ahead and be around them."
22446,It sounded like his implication was that the likely immune relative would pose little danger to you as well.
22447,"Also, do you have KN95 masks you'd recommend?"
22448,I won't need to use them often but my Dad has been working throughout this pandemic with cloth masks :(
22449,"Americans don't like being told what to do, no matter what, and hate changing their routine or opinions."
22450,"That's what happens when you drill the word ""freedom"" into the heads of children for decades; they think they get a free pass to do whatever they want and can harm others for even insinuating that they might be incorrect."
22451,"Basically, spoiled adult children that the government refuses to teach, because they vote."
22452,"Mine won't let people in without a mask, but most immediately pull it down to their chin after they pass the greeter and don't put it back up until they reach the line."
22453,I haven't seen anyone called on it yet.
22454,Covid vaccine guinea pig here.
22455,With the virus spreading out of control right now I’m more worried about you than me.
22456,Are you really wearing a valved respirator?
22457,"That does make sense, but it seems more logical to do it based on population density of counties since going off of this reasoning that’s where there would be the highest number of patients per health care worker."
22458,"There are large swaths of large states with very low population density that may be doing poorly with covid, but they will get access sooner than states like north/south dakota where the population is quite low but they are the hardest hit places on the planet right now."
22459,We have no idea.
22460,None.
22461,Not one tiny scrap of an iota of a thought of what the long term effects of this virus will be.
22462,"We can draw some conclusions based on our understanding of virology, but we really have no clue about what this virus will do to our populace as they age."
22463,Yeah it's crazy how I look back to when there were so few cases and think back to how I thought compared to cases today.
22464,"I didn't want to leave the house when we had 1,000 daily cases."
22465,"Now we're averaging 8K-10K and I really just don't feel like taking the chance this year if i'm not seeing people anyway, like you said."
22466,Thank you for telling me your experience!
22467,"Ahhh, that sucks."
22468,I'm sorry to hear that.
22469,Came across our interaction and was hoping for good news.
22470,I have the same issue before these things where I will have a horrible night the day before due to anticipatory stress.
22471,Hoping for the next chance then.
22472,"Who knows, maybe this will lead you by accident to a ""working from home"" one."
22473,Good luck :)
22474,Dave told me that he cured his Covid by shooting it out of his lungs.
22475,"Yup, 5.56 NATO boys - all you’ll ever need."
22476,How can a prediction be ”factually false”?
22477,"The mask is more to protect others from you, not so much you from others (though it does that too, to some degree)."
22478,"Ugh, that’s a bummer."
22479,All 3 Costco’s in my area enforce the mask mandate.
22480,So far no one’s been a douche about it.

22482,One of my worst fears is forgetting things.
22483,"I've worked in an Alzheimer's ward and it was not pretty, to put it VERY lightly."
22484,I have autism and would never do either of those things.
22485,I don't know anyone with Downs that would do this either.
22486,What is it about normally functioning brains that makes them do something so stupid?
22487,"""The night is always darkest before the dawn""

If Covid turns out to be the tragedy that births a whole new era of medical advancement once we have the pandemic behind us that would be a trip"
22488,"This is a non-issue, you simply take vaccine every 6 or 12 months."
22489,Nearly vomited on my phone after reading this
22490,That's basically where I'm at.
22491,I would love to have kids but the cons far outweigh the pros in just about any situation for me
22492,"He didn't die of a car accident, he just died of blood loss"
22493,[removed]
22494,"It’s not dumb, no."
22495,"My wife and I got our a month ago when cases had tapered off a bit, at a local clinic."
22496,"We took turns sitting in the car, and each wore a respirator (KN95 for her, P100 for me with the funny pink filter cartridges)."
22497,I remarked to her that it was the first time someone outside our household had touched me at all in what felt like a long time.
22498,"Right now with cases exploding I’d probably just stay home like I am and figure I’m not getting any viruses doing so, flu or COVID-19."
22499,"We have five separate agreements with different vaccine companies, and we also put some money into research."
22500,We will need the vaccine so we can open our borders.
22501,We would have been up the creek if the vaccines had all turned out to be duds.
22502,"As long as you don't wear the ""mask"" on your dick, amirite Francis?"
22503,DEAR.
22504,GOD.
22505,MAN.
22506,I’d love it if it worked like organ donation opt.
22507,"You can sign a waiver to not wear a mask in public (not valid at any private venue, public transport, etc)."
22508,But you get Covid and need a hospital bed?
22509,Tough shit.
22510,"It may be a shitty sight to see, but I won’t look."
22511,"On SSI, can confirm."
22512,"It was not an infallible statement, he was not speaking ex cathedra."
22513,Trumpets for sure...hope their guns are illegal because they are definitely getting “taken” now..😂 too bad the dems and the elephant dicks can’t come up with enough restrictions and background checks these idiots will surely have guns again in their future so no worries folks..all will be well.
22514,"Agreed, Costco is the only place even remotely ""kinda safe"""
22515,I looked and I can't find anything
22516,You are helping me make my point.
22517,Wearing masks in public does nothing if people do not wear them in private settings like your work.
22518,I have to wear masks the moment I leave my house but can take it of in a restaurant or bar.
22519,It’s stupid.
22520,That was it's main avenue when hard research started in the 1990s.
22521,So bizarre that the one unpatriotic cunt that risks spreading a deadly disease amongst Americans was the one that took umbrage to mask wearing.
22522,"Trump might get to celebrate breaking 29,000 all over again"
22523,"There is hope, at least in Illinois we had a massive spike in cases and now we're hopefully beginning to see the start of a down trend."
22524,We'd need people to truly give absolutely no fucks at all about the pandemic or hospital data to reach that rapid amount of spread for a prolonged amount of time.
22525,Luckily I think the fact that hospitals are being overwhelmed is shocking enough people.

22532,"Moral of the story: 

Mind ya business."
22533,"My employer invited a couple of doctors in to take questions from employees over the summer, kind of as a way to allay fears."
22534,"The doc got up and said, “if you get this, and it’s bad enough that you are going into the hospital, expect 30 days or so I’m there on average, also expect that if it gets bad while in the hospital, if you survive, you could easily be leaving the hospital missing fingers, hands, toes, feet, arms, and legs, or simply with severe permanent organ damage."
22535,"The good news is currently we have the staff and medication to treat you, so you probably won’t die, but once we hit our limit, deaths will follow, and what would have been a minor problem that a few mitigation treatments would have solved is now going to be life threatening, so you should do everything in your power to stem the tide, flatten the curve, and stay healthy.”

Our CEO was like, “ surely you’re telling us the worst case scenarios, like most people who get this will be fine right?” 

And the doc said “ I’m telling you what you should expect if you show up in my hospital."
22536,Based on the last 5 months of this pandemic.
22537,"Yes, as far as we know most people will be fine, but this disease has more that we still don’t know about it."
22538,It doesn’t affect two people of similar demographics the same way.
22539,"I’ve seen 70 year olds who survive it just fine, and 30 year olds stroke out because of it."
22540,"We use the comorbidities  to estimate chances, but nothing is known."
22541,We don’t even know the long term effects of this virus.
22542,"We know it spreads easily, we know it can be deadly, and we know that we have no cure right now.”

Silence in the room."
22543,"My company updated their covid policy the next day, and delayed the return to office schedule to make the 100% return policy indefinitely."
22544,That doctor probably saved thousands of lives just from that town hall style meeting.
22545,This joke isn't making me laugh.
22546,The disgusting part is where the prison industrial complex forces me to pay for their incarceration through my tax dollars.
22547,"I want no part in in providing their welfare behind bars, I would prefer to see their belongings repossessed to pay for their own failures."
22548,"Full stop, people like this are past the point of rehabilitation."
22549,I bet some businesses will be “no masks allowed” at some point.
22550,I bought a place in a town I didn't currently live in but was moving to for work.
22551,I spent a week up here house hunting in between my first full work days in my new location.
22552,My realtor was an a godsend
22553,"And to the people who now have no income, what do you suggest they do?"
22554,I paid $250.
22555,Friend paid $285.
22556,Another paid $120.
22557,So...yeah.
22558,It’s just false that masks provide equivalent protection to a vaccine.
22559,"Mine does, because it’s a crazy-looking P100 respirator meant for filtering out dangerous aerosols."
22560,But the typical surgical mask or cloth face covering people are wearing don’t do nearly as much to protect the wearer.
22561,150k people die every day from all causes pre-covid.
22562,Im sorry to be so blunt but your comment is borderline embarrassing to have read.
22563,YES the virus is serious and YES 1 preventable death is too many but you are simply not grounded in reality with your viewpoint.
22564,No disrespect intended.
22565,It’s an American company started by americans.
22566,What do you expect?
22567,"3,000 died = never forget

22576,There are complaints that they should get a tuition refund... but no governors freaking out over closed unis.
22577,"In Europe, a lot of countries tried, and failed, to do this effectively."
22578,I'm still wondering why this is the case.
22579,"Is it lack of organisation, infrastructure?"
22580,Or are there more factors in play?
22581,"For example, the interconnectedness of our society?"
22582,Or maybe cultural habits that spread disease?
22583,"Maybe even climate, or building standards?"
22584,"You'd think that if it was just government, there'd at least be some countries in Europe that would succeed, at least some of the time."
22585,"Some countries do better than others, but China is immensely more effective."
22586,Can confirm.
22587,"The nausea was real, but it didn’t last long."
22588,"PA has been seeing cases rise steadily over the last few weeks, way higher than the March peak."
22589,But I feel like the government is being more lax with limiting gatherings/precautions - why is that?
22590,"No, I think the goalposts were just always further away than many people assumed and desired."
22591,I'm stuck with my family who plans to have Thanksgiving.
22592,"Though it's only an uncle driving in from out of state who lives alone and has socially isolated the last couple weeks, so the risk isn't as high as a 10 person Thanksgiving."
22593,I'm just frustrated that my family doesn't have the patience to just wait a few more months for the vaccine and would rather risk potential death and family tragedy for a few measly days of visitation.
22594,"Yes, ventilators."
22595,Sorry
22596,"Like what I suggested above, write down their name, date, and time."

22601,This holiday isn't like 4th of July where it's just friends meeting up &amp; celebrating.
22602,"Like Xmas it's specifically centered around extended family, including the older generation who's at very high risk of being hospitalized, crippled or dying."
22603,And don't forget that right now 40% of hospitalized covid patients in LA County are under age 65!
22604,Modern medical system wasn't designed to treat a flood of ppl who should be healthy.
22605,All these cases will divert attention from other critical care illnesses.
22606,Everyone will suffer because of substandard hospital care.
22607,A well fitting n95 or p100 gives a justified sense of security in most situations.
22608,If you filter your air well you are probably fine until it reaches levels you are worried about eyeball exposure.
22609,N95 and face shield combo is pretty effective.
22610,That’s the point Dr. Michael Osterholm (now member of the Biden COVID-19 task force) makes.
22611,"By all means wear the masks, he says, but don’t let it make you complacent."
22612,"As he put it in his most recent podcast, the bottom line is don’t swap other people’s air."
22613,Yes already saw this happening on fox News earlier this evening... eyeroll
22614,"You know those have a valve, right?"
22615,Did you tape it up or something?
22616,Get well soon!
22617,"&gt;“All of this makes me wonder why we aren’t talking about getting New Mexicans back to work and getting students back to school,” Rep. Phelps Anderson of Roswell said."
22618,What the flying fuck?
22619,"Half the country slept through health and biology classes and don't have a goddamn clue how infectious diseases work, and they're fucking things up for the rest of us due to their ignorance."
22620,"You argue like my little brother, who makes any irregularity the most important point at the expense of any intelligent discourse."
22621,You and I are both pro-mask but you are filled with such bile you make everyone your enemy.
22622,Wow!
22623,It just goes to show that these guys are just classic bully's.
22624,Mostly just cowards and fold if you dont show fear.
22625,I don't think I've ever heard someone with experience say Cleveland is anything but a place to run terrified and screaming from.
22626,Columbus bid sweet tho.
22627,"Some of it, at least."
22628,All those people need schools to be open so that they solve their childcare needs.
22629,Well 1000s then.
22630,"But yeah, I did know many hospitals are at their breaking point."
22631,"But if we had 5000 dying a day, drastic measures would be taken before those numbers of deaths popped up because that would mean like 30,40, 50% community spread."
22632,A nightmare scenario.
22633,"Sadly, Trump is still President, and we might get to that nightmare scenario and no leadership, action taken."
22634,you must not be into women.
22635,pretty good looking.
22636,"Its worse, its a fuck you, I'll do as I want."
22637,Im sorry facts triggered you
22638,"They are making the claim, ask them for the results of the randomized controlled study"
22639,"&gt; However, false negatives are more common than false positives."
22640,This wouldnt be a false positive though.
22641,That is when the test detects virus but none is there.
22642,"This is detecting real virus, but you got tested in the 2 month window *after* your infection, rather than the 1 or 2 week window before/during your infection, and your old infection triggers the positive."
22643,That's not a false positive.
22644,The most convincing explanation I've heard with pre-election polls not lining up well with actual results in recent years is that almost nobody wants to answer phone spam calls.
22645,"The only people willing to take the call are either unusually trusting, unusually polite, or politically aware enough to recognize a polling company on their caller ID."
22646,So the pollsters aren't really getting a representative sample of the public.
22647,That same percentage keeps coming up over and over again.
22648,"Hmmmmm, wonder why?"
22649,[archive link for anyone who has trouble accessing the article ](https://archive.is/zuK7A)
22650,"Maybe this summer, although I think they will be recommended for some places for another year."
22651,"In case you hadn't noticed, the deaths are going up, sir ""muh freedumbs""."
22652,The amount they pay adminstrators like VPs and Provosts and such is pretty obscene.

22654,Yeah my bad lol !

22656,How frequently?
22657,"No its not, but insurance companies will cover the entire cost."

22659,No such thing as a free lunch.
22660,"Japan's total test to date is only 3.3 million, just below Iraq, and Iraq has a quarter the population...."

22664,All your doing is giving that opinion the oxygen it needs to flourish
22665,about fucking time aint it
22666,I feel the same.
22667,I'm at the point I wouldn't care if doctors and nurses just went on strike.
22668,They don't deserve the emotional scars and horrible treatment society has been giving them.
22669,Exactly.
22670,A lot of people are tired of having to give up their normal lives and their livelihoods to a virus that has an extremely small chance of killing someone.
22671,Yes the deaths are sad but life has to go on.

Record COVID Related Hospitalizations means something very different and not nearly as severe, yet."

22715,"But we made these plans over a month ago, and she refuses to even consider cancelling the trip even though the whole country is going to shit."
22716,"Meanwhile, CA is ""advising"" residents not to travel and is ""advising"" a 14-day quarantine when they return, but it isn't enforced, so she's basically planning on ignoring it."
22717,"We already had her cancel a planned trip over the summer, so if we say no now, my wife is basically getting disowned by all of the Republicans on her side of the family."

22772,"Also, the type of plumbing most people need to do is extremely low."
22773,"If people had a better understanding of math/science, plumbing and electrical work would be much easier for them."

22801,The covid brain fog is a different beast.
22802,I also get accompanying pressure/ headaches when it’s really bad.
22803,It’s very unnerving.

22822,"What matters is how we can distribute it such that it limits transmission, hospitalization, and death as much as possible

Distributing it to those that can limit transmission, hospitalization, and death *are* the ones who deserve it the most..."
22823,Except that is not what they are doing.
22824,They are trying to gather the data that followed the original protocol.
22825,They are excluding the data that shows much higher efficacy.
22826,25-30% of Americans are blissfully ignorant and have a blatant disregard for everyone who has died or lost a loved one to this virus.
22827,That number is most certainly too low.
22828,I understand exactly what you are saying.
22829,I was just curious how you came to the conclusion that I dont by my original comment.
22830,You sure seem to assume things about others a little too much honestly.
22831,They probably had no way to get out during quarantine.
22832,Abusers do things to isolate gheir victims like controlling access to money and transportation or pushing away friends and family members.
22833,"If you can't leave the house for work or other reasons, it would definitely be harder to get away."
22834,I agree.
22835,Long term and short term effects of COVID seem way more likely than anything a vaccine is capable of doing.
22836,Ugh that's ridiculous.
22837,What the hell is the money going towards?
22838,Lord knows it wasn't towards heating/ac in the dorms or doing even basic maintenance.
22839,My dad doesn't wear seat belts either funny enough.
22840,The areas that will see declining case numbers are places with low numbers anyways.
22841,My “small” county has 2 million people.
22842,"We have 150-200 cases most days, which is far higher than it has been."
22843,My county has more people in it than most states.
22844,"Go a bit south of me, and county’s with 100k people are seeing the same numbers... which is a lot more dangerous."
22845,Those are the places ignoring the governors orders and not masking up.
22846,The dense areas in the state will probably see a sharp decline in cases.
22847,The rural areas?
22848,Nah.
22849,"And then there’s orange county, which is probably just fucked."
22850,I agree.
22851,Yeah they do.
22852,Because people like me in other countries vote for them and want them to do it.
22853,If where I am does not require visitors to vaccinate before they come I will be protesting on the street.
22854,"I do not need another pandemic that ruins my life and kills the people around me, because you think you are more important than the people that live here."
22855,And for sure nobody will enter my business if they are not vaccinated after it is widely available.
22856,I already have to card ppl when they come here anyway.
22857,So might as well check their vaccination status.
22858,You really are the dense one by announcing your departure.
22859,If you didnt want to waste time you would never have replied.
22860,We arent at Heathrow
22861,Same thing happened during the worst plagues in History.
22862,They attempted to stop travel but the Lords and Ladies all went to their holiday homes in the countryside and spread the plagues more.
22863,"On another note, I am not some conspiracy theorist claiming all large companies and statisticians are liars."
22864,I get the feeling you have sat through several research methods and stats courses.
22865,"Although the Mark Twain quote, ""There are lies, dam lies, and statistics"" is one of my favorite sayings; it's a quote I picked up studying Stats."
22866,I get the feeling that if you and I were sitting there talking about this over a cup of coffee we would agree.
22867,I also see how my initial comment could be seen as an attack on the profession.
22868,That was not my intent.
22869,My 73in wingspan went from bunk to bunk
22870,that's just not true and it sickens me to see it upvoted.
22871,it's still possible to do everything right and get sick.
22872,The white House and the white house task force unfortunately are not on the same page.
22873,"Nj is leading the per capita death rate, headline is misleading"
22874,you really are this dense.
22875,"yea, not wasting my time on you."
22876,bye.
22877,I do not understand how selecting the data from the protocol you said you would originally follow is changing the protocol or cherry picking data.
22878,From what I’ve read a mistake was made in one of the trial arms where only half the original vaccine dose was given.
22879,They are EXCLUDING that data and attempting to analyze only at the arms that followed the original protocol.
22880,Then they are pulling the phase 2 data that also followed the same protocol in an attempt to gain more subjects.
22881,None of this sounds like intentionally changing the protocol or cherry picking data.
22882,To me it sounds like they are doing their best to standardize the data.
22883,Buried in that data is the tantalizing possibility no one saw coming that a half dose first may increase efficacy.
22884,They are now trying to change current trials to add that arm in.
22885,This can be done if they change their recruitment numbers in their phase three trials.
22886,None of this is shady trying to boost their efficacy actions.
22887,"This is more, wow - we may have found a better way to administer this vaccine let’s see if that result can be replicated in a trial designed to test this."
22888,Not bad enough yet.
22889,You're quite correct that R0 in this case becomes a function of time due to seasonality.
22890,We're likewise changing R0 whenever we change our behavior.
22891,"For example, we can roughly understand a lockdown as an attempt to bring R0 near 1 through behavior changes, so that the herd immunity threshold becomes 0% and spread is slow even in a mostly-naive population."
22892,And I appreciate your response.

22920,Of course you deal with situation at hand.
22921,Whats at hand is a SD with recent death rate highest in the world.

22944,This.
22945,It's ONE FUCKING HOLIDAY SEASON!

22947,!
22948,There really isn’t.
22949,"There are dozens of correlation = causation studies where many non-medical interventions were made simultaneously (close schools, bars, stay home orders, and masks), but there are few to no studies that use solely masks and control them in a randomized study where all other things are equal and some people wear masks and others don’t."
22950,The Danish study that just came out is the only study that I’m aware of that did this and it showed 0 benefit to the wearer.
22951,"Again, masks aren’t harmful and I think it isn’t crazy to think they have some benefit, but evidence that they work is very weak."
22952,Just look at those meat packing plants where everyone wears a mask and everyone got sick.
22953,"At the very least they may work a little but are totally overwhelmed if social distancing can’t be followed (and since masks are supposed to be the solution to when social distancing can’t be followed, this isn’t a testament to their usefulness)"
22954,"Yeah, we serve large businesses in the market research field which has been hit super hard."
22955,Our niche is in person market research which as you can imagine has been hit extra special hard.

22961,They won't be here or given widespread by the time this out of control virus has spiraled everything to make it worse.

And everyone was saying that Covid was actually much less deadly than the 3-5% that was being claimed at the time, and that the world was going to go into giant lockdown that would relax in the summertime so that the wintertime lockdown could be squarely blamed on people misbehaving and people protesting, and that the only way out of the lockdowns would be to get vaccinated and everybody would have some kind of ""proof"" of vaccination that they would need to work or travel and that was all part of some giant ""One World Government"" plan to take over the world and usher it into a technocratic surveillance state."

23054,&gt;Tf does this have to do with a governor preventing local officials from mask mandates?
23055,If anyone is assuming...its you.
23056,The fact that you don't even understand what I'm talking about is another big part of the problem.

23072,That is literally how most vaccines work and is (or should be) common knowledge.
23073,"https://www.publichealth.org/public-awareness/understanding-vaccines/vaccines-work/

&gt;By injecting these antigens into the body, the immune system can safely learn to recognize them as hostile invaders, produce antibodies, and remember them for the future."
23074,"If the bacteria or virus reappears, the immune system will recognize the antigens immediately and attack aggressively well before the pathogen can spread and cause sickness."
23075,TLDR a vaccine is not a magic shield that prevents the virus from entering your body **which means you can still spread it**.
23076,But it equips your body with the means to fight it so that you don't actually feel sick.
23077,"And even though you can still spread it, the assumption is that you will spread it to somebody else *who also is vaccinated*, thus eliminating the risk."
23078,What an asshole.
23079,the situation where i live is totally insane.
23080,even healthcare workers won't wear masks consistently.
23081,"my family members who work in healthcare refuse to wear a mask in many public situations and try to convince me not to wear them, while just today the clerk at my doctor's office wasn't wearing a mask when i came in and talked to me with it under her nose."
23082,"my mother who i live with is having her very elderly mother come visit in january and when i suggested that if i travel for surgery it could be good for me to stay somewhere else until i get a negative result to avoid putting my grandmother's life at risk she told me to ""not worry about it"" - because ""if we don't get it while traveling and repeatedly stopping at restaurants then you won't be the one to give it to us."""
23083,she explicitly told me it wasn't worth worrying about her mother's life.
23084,she also has people without masks in the house and has had her friend from out of state visit multiple times.
23085,she told me she was disappointed her friend wasn't coming for thanksgiving - which she doesn't normally even celebrate besides whatever i prepare for her.
23086,"i will be the first to admit that i'm far from a flawless person, but it's incredibly frustrating to me that people won't take even the smallest changes to save other people's lives."
23087,if this is the best we can do then human society is screwed.
23088,"Just a fun fact, im Polish and my employer did not inform me that one of my coworkers was quarantined due to her room mate having coronavirus untill she was back from quarantine and working for two weeks i had some contact with her beforehand but not on a daily basis, a week after she was quarantined i mysteriously got quite seriously ill but my fever was 1 degree to low to qualify for testing."

23245,There were at least 5-7 million people like me(returning to Shanghai from other places).
23246,So every and each of those are checked and registered in Shanghai's 20-million+  system.
23247,That of course helped a lot in controlling and tracking the pandemic.

23301,People were pretty much only tested when they were admitted to hospitals or if they were essential workers (e.g.
23302,hospital staff).
23303,So they real number of infections is certainly a lot higher than 226k.
23304,"Also, herd immunity is never an on/off switch - it's a gradient that affects the R0 number."
23305,It helps keep infections down in the same as measures such as social distancing helps.
23306,"If some restrictions are kept, the immunity required to control the spread."
23307,"And even without restrictions, 70% is probably a bit high as it assumes homogenous spread, while the virus spreads heterogenously (which is of course a lot harder to model properly, so any prediction is very uncertain)."
23308,"And to avoid misunderstanding, I am not arguing for pursuing herd immunity in any way, I just want to get facts straight."
23309,Terminator actually.
23310,"Not funny, not really a guy."
23311,Yes it is.
23312,I'm not going to downplay the tragedy of death.
23313,I personally can't handle death or loss at all.
23314,It's a huge weakness of mine.
23315,However.
23316,About 50 million people die in the world every year.
23317,About 3 million die in the US every year.
23318,So Covid has caused an additional 3% of deaths in the world and 8% of deaths in the US.
23319,That is a great tragedy.
23320,Every single one of those deaths is.
23321,And so is every single one of the other 92-97% of deaths that happen every year.
23322,The aspect of this pandemic that will cause long lasting changes in the world isn't the deaths.
23323,"It's the changes in governmental policy, increased prevalence of remote working, and more difficult international travel."
23324,That's what separates the new normal from the old normal.
23325,Not a 3-8% increase in deaths.
23326,"What the hell was ""normal"" after the subprime mortgage crisis?"
23327,The dot com bubble?
23328,Japan's economic crash in the 90s?
23329,The great depression?
23330,"What the hell was ""normal"" after the spanish flu, or the beginning of AIDS, or all the other pandemics of the 1900s?"
23331,Life goes on.
23332,Changes are made and we keep going.
23333,I work for a school district that forced all hourly staff to work from the building.
23334,I am a paraprofessional.
23335,"They told the teachers that have virtual classes that they didn't have to wear their mask - even if another staff member, who does not have the choice to work from home, is in the room."
23336,The teacher I am assigned to refuses to wear a mask.
23337,She got together with her family.
23338,She came to work while they had pending tests.
23339,She exposed me to covid.
23340,I was told I wasn't allowed to quarantine from work until she tested positive.
23341,She withheld her positive test result from the school district for an entire week.
23342,She admitted to my face that she was positive and hadn't told the school.
23343,I had to email my principal.
23344,They tried to tell me I wasn't a close enough contact.
23345,They refused - principal and superintendent - to enforce their own mask rules for staff.
23346,I've never been treated so condescendingly and dismissively in my life.
23347,"And now I have to worry if I or my husband will get sick and die, because we are high risk but my job is full of assholes."
23348,"The school decided to go all virtual for students after Thanksgiving - but I still have to come in and sit in a room with an unmasked person all day, because they don't trust us to work from home."
23349,"Schools need to get back to in person classes by the Fall, and I dont see why they wouldnt be able to with a vaccine expected to be widely available by the Spring, most arent a huge concern for actual deaths, most are a huge concern for spread."
23350,Trump dgaf he's busy partying and moping.
23351,This is odd as I’m not hearing a thing about this and I’ve got family there and friends.
23352,"Well, someone didn't follow the guidelines if one of them brought the virus to the gathering."
23353,I hope they are all okay but the headline is kind of misleading.
23354,Ha.
23355,Well that will certainly change.
23356,It basically occured to me early on that everyone would have to basically generate their own risk profile.
23357,That risk profile should be basically the safest lifestyle you can afford and stand.
23358,For each person that will be different.
23359,"The important thing is sticking to that risk profile, and not letting it slip."
23360,"I'd rather people be trying their best than throwing up their hands, it's more about attitude."
23361,For me that includes going to a gym and maintaining my health.
23362,"I judge that to be a moderate risk, given the particulars."
23363,But it is the ONE moderate risk I am taking.
23364,No but its r/t a persons sense of entitlement.
23365,My comment was obviously a joke.
23366,"LOL, talk about someone who believes in ***their*** ""own little \[afterlife\] world,"" this guy is one hell of a player."
23367,"""I'll have my cake and eat it to,"" is what I bet he says before bedtime."
23368,No they won't unfortunately.
23369,"Same here, as a Brazilian."
23370,No surprise our three presidents are denialers assholes.
23371,We have never locked down and I never worked from home one day.
23372,Many people did though.
23373,We closed borders with Wuhan at the start of January because we have cultural PTSD from SARS and do not trust China.
23374,"In March, our borders were near completely closed."
23375,"We had about 300 domestically transmitted cases in total between February and May but contact tracing was extremely swift and public measures for distancing, masks, and closure of non essential businesses had basically a 100% adoption rate country wide."
23376,These days travel back in require two negative PCR tests and a mandatory 14 days quarantine.
23377,We cannot open borders unless vaccines are widespread because we have zero immunity as a nation.
23378,"Therefore, it's imperative that the vaccines happen for us."
23379,"Your idea of ""let's just wait until the virus sort of fades"" will not work for us because if we open up pre-vaccine we will just go through the same thing except 1 year later than everyone else."
23380,I said nothing about changing to western standards.
23381,"Having lived in Japan for well over a decade, including having both my children born there, I can pretty confidently say change of any kind is slow In Japan."
23382,That has great benefits but also drawbacks.
23383,It wasn’t a blanket criticism.
23384,"Shit, if I could get a Bronco with the vaccine I’d be ON IT"
23385,"Many, many stories of violence."
23386,It seems to me that some people on this sub often fail to realize that there are other concerns in life that are not covid.
23387,He's trying to protect the workers the same just in a different... more immediately relevant way.
23388,"Compared to a largely flu-like disease (which it almost is, at an individual level), it's entirely justifiable if one perceives violence as a 'more certain' death."
23389,Who is to blame such a decision?
23390,Semi-related.
23391,I am a dentist and almost all dentists/hygienists that I see in online dentist groups (this may be key factor—perhaps the more “notable” people in the online communities are simply more likely to be very vocal) think it is way overblown if not a hoax.
23392,"I’m not in any way trying to imply that dentists are authority figures on the topic, or that anyone should care what a dentist thinks on a topic outside their expertise."
23393,"Just trying to shed light on how seemingly many in another type of healthcare profession, who SHOULD respect science and evidence, still think it is all blown out of proportion."
23394,Then throw a /s tag on it because there are people who actually think this way
23395,"My family can be a bit of a mixed bag, I’ve known I wasn’t going to go home for a while because they aren’t taking distancing seriously IMO."
23396,My brother in law got Covid last week so I didn’t even have to bother with the discussion about it.
23397,I’m relieved to not have to travel and be away from my home for once.

23407,Americans are pathological liars.
23408,You can trust surveys.

23414,"Huh, how could you spell billion without a b?"
23415,This is the reality.
23416,Trump got it and he's old and fat and he recovered in like 3-4 days.
23417,To a lot of people that proves that this is overblown.
23418,"The mayors in most towns don't want to tell the business owners ""no""."
23419,Dang you got a bonus?
23420,"They don't want to pay you more because its not profitable"", its worth it to fuck you over then say "" we need travel nurses because ...""."
23421,They can write the cost of travel nurses off and still end up with a profit thats close to what they had before.
23422,if you get paid they can't write it off and it hurts the bottom line
23423,"If you are making a profit in health care, you have a perverse incentive to deny care to increase revenue."
23424,Unfortunately where I live if you don’t show symptoms they refuse to test you.
23425,"We had a worker that had been exposed to COVID and when he tried to get tested to come back to work they told him no test without symptoms, he tried multiple places."
23426,"3000 is a tragedy, 250,000 is a statistic"
23427,I think your referencing Hue Murr?
23428,Very funny guy
23429,They basically did a soft lockdown.
23430,It was all voluntary and people were just recommended to WFH.
23431,Schools stayed open for example.
23432,"I don't think the vaccination rates can be reliably predicted, much depends on upstream supplies, the willingness to get vaccinated, and whether vaccines can prevent transmission (likely in my opinion)."
23433,But at least the supply is looking better and better each day.
23434,"Also, rapid tests will be widely available in a few months, which will also change things for the better."
23435,"Large-scale rapid testing is extremely effective, as China and Slovakia repeatedly demonstrated."
23436,"It doesn't even enforced on everyone, a mandatory weekly test in companies and schools would be enough to end the epidemic even without vaccines."
23437,My father has hepatic encephalopathy which causes cognitive loss that presents very similarly to Alzheimer's.
23438,"The difference is... he is terminal, and I hate that I find myself thinking that is the better of the alternative."

23447,In the US it's literally a yellow sheet of paper.
23448,Isn't it
23449,"Great, good news, I guess we can just forget the thousands dead everyday here in the US because uh Poland hypothetically had more equivalent deaths."
23450,Thanks!
23451,I'm glad someone finally noticed.
23452,Thought long and hard about it.
23453,I had a trip booked in March that I have to reschedule :/
23454,That's a wierd way of saying that the lockdown skeptics have been proven wrong about basically every point of scientific fact that they've ever espoused.
23455,"&gt; I think it's the correct strategy

Then you underestimate how mamy will have to die."
23456,:(
23457,"By design, my friend."
23458,Stay safe out there.
23459,"Funny, here in Illinois, they're advising against small gatherings (and gathering for Thanksgiving) but restaurants are still open for outdoor dining."
23460,Just demoralizing on top of it all.
23461,Getting dirty is fun.
23462,https://workerorganizing.org
23463,"So just reading the headline it got me asking
New Mexico the state?"
23464,Or a new Mexico legislator that was just voted in.
23465,That 70% also includes asymptomatic cases as participants were tested weekly.
23466,BiotechN and moderna only tested people if they presented symptoms.
23467,So even if the exact same vaccines were tested they would show lower efficacy due to that alone.
23468,"&gt;It’s the fact that there are many professions that aren’t “essential” but are forced to be out there in the public, putting them at risk."
23469,"Agree completely, of which people who are paid to push an editorial line should be at the bottom."
23470,Measly measles I call it
23471,Hospital systems merging is happening all over the healthcare industry.
23472,They're only taking geology to debunk you globe-heads.
23473,unpopular opinion: forcing people to take any kind of medical treatment is tremendously unethical
23474,LOL.
23475,I’m glad you remember that.
23476,The “masks don’t work” campaign was the largest psychological warfare campaign since the election and with Cambridge Analytica (see “the great hack” on Netflix).
23477,"I watched as they spread it in the news, all over online, over 200 million tweets from hundreds of thousands of Twitter bots in the largest marketing campaign I’ve ever seen (impossible that it was not developed many months in advance) and then they launched another on Facebook which lasted a few days before FB deleted the accounts and posts."
23478,But all the damage was done.
23479,They created division.
23480,They created anger.
23481,They created the rocket fuel needed to do what they are doing.
23482,"Out of everything that Covid-19 brought, the craziest part of all of it was the US launching their own campaigns on US soil to mind-fuck the masses."
23483,Operation confusion followed right after with the release of conflicting stories and news daily.
23484,It was extremely easy to recognize all of this as a large group I’m a part of studied what tactics Cambridge Analytica used and years ago.
23485,"Add in some psychology, text book “division”, protests, etc."
23486,"for control, and you create the perfect environment to set the stage for the next act."
23487,Not conspiracy theories - this all really happened.
23488,Evidence still very much out there.
23489,Just google around.
23490,"Anyway, I’m glad you brought that up."
23491,"A VERY small % of people understand the bigger game that’s being played - as most citizens have been played... with many taking the hook, line, and sinker."
23492,"My brothers district is holding out, they have been open everyday Monday-Friday since august and have not had any super spreader events."
23493,"They require masks all day, only time they are allowed off is if they are outside, or are eating, and while eating they must stay 6 feet from anyone."
23494,"They require a 14 day mandatory quarantine if you are anywhere near someone infected, and that 14 days can not be skipped with a negative test."
23495,Very strict contact tracing.
23496,Free testing for anyone in the school system.
23497,"Lunch has been expanded from the cafeteria and includes the Auditorium, and the 2 gyms they have to make sure students can follow social distancing."
23498,"Waves of people leaving the school, if you are driving home you leave first, then 10 minutes later the people getting picked up or walking leave, then 10 minutes later the students requiring busses leave."
23499,"Deaths by age in the US: 79% of all US deaths due to the Virus are people 65 and over(which is why they get the vaccine first), and 92% of all US deaths from the Virus are 55 years old and over"
23500,They need to quit carving out anti-scientific exceptions for restaurants.
23501,"Sorry to hear, I had a blast traveling around a couple years ago and would love to come back some day."
23502,there are programs and tax write-offs for the traveling nurses.
23503,Government also has nurses that will come in to assist these smaller hospitals.
23504,there are plenty of capitalist countries dealing with this well.
23505,It's not like New Zealand is some socialist paradise.
23506,"There is way more at play here than ""capitalism bad!"""
23507,"They are not both exponential functions of x, and normally x is implied to be the dependent variable."

23515,"The problem is this ruling will end up being used for flu vaccine, which isn't ending any pandemic."
23516,I don't want to argue whether it's useful or not.
23517,"But I want to be very firm that these medical choices should be up to the parents, not up to the government."
23518,And?

23520,"Government:

23521,The only difference between a patriot and a nationalist is propaganda and violence.
23522,"Indoor dining was permitted to appease those who (rightfully, in my opinion) complained about jobs and the economy."
23523,"So if you're asking, ""Why can I eat in a restaurant, but not have thanksgiving dinner,"" you're making a false equivalence."
23524,Shocker.
23525,There's still a 5-10% chance that the vaccine is isn't effective for someone and that could potentially be troublesome if there's not enough people agreeing to take the vaccine.
23526,Time to take my kids out of daycare
23527,Higher points of contact and spreading the virus.
23528,"If I have to quarantine as a teacher it forces me to use my entire year of sick leave, and when that runs out to pay for my sub out of pocket."
23529,"Without proper employee protections, hard pass."
23530,"I don't know where the hell you're getting 99.9% from, because all statistics points towards 2-3% death rate (assuming you meant survival rate and not death rate)

And that's not even counting for the excess deaths which are likely covid related, unless there's another mystery disease going around that's killing people by the thousands"
23531,"&gt; potentially millions dead if nothing is done

&gt; by that logic, nothing should be done and millions should be dead to prevent millions from being dead"
23532,I think it should be up to the business owners to make and enforce their own rules.
23533,Yes.
23534,"If you would acknowledge that the median age of death from COVID is ~80 years old, but it can still kill millions with uncontrolled spread, that would be be a much better strategy than fucking scare tactics and trying to convince healthy young people that they have a significant risk of dying from the virus."
23535,Vaccine has already been shipped you?
23536,Are you in healthcare?
23537,"I get the hesitation but we already can't travel to various countries without proof of vaccination, and we can't put our kids in public school without many, or put kids in college dorms without proof of meningitis vaccine."
23538,Pushing back on mandated COVID vaccines just seems like fighting the ocean
23539,"Maybe you should be sighing about something different, because Peet Tüll is Swedish."
23540,Yep.
23541,Its basically the symptom of a society that has become so enamoured with its own bullshit that it believes making a few new rules or PR announcements will warp reality through the popular of popularity.

23544,You are correct except watching this never ending shitshow unravel since day one with the door slammed shut everytime we glimpsed daylight...
23545,I'm just snake-bit and geared to expect the worse.
23546,So yes you can call me a skeptic and cynical
23547,We hear you.
23548,Be safe.
23549,That and the shaming culture behind all of it.
23550,"Abstinence-only methodologies don't work for anything, be it sex education or surviving through a pandemic."
23551,People need to be educated about decreasing risk to themselves and others wherever they're able and willing.
23552,"""If you're going to travel anyway, then do this..."" ""If you're going to have a Thanksgiving gathering anyway, then do this..."" Then maybe people wouldn't feel the need to refuse masks just to make a statement and we'd have 100% participation where it matters most."
23553,Czechia isn't doing much better either.
23554,It has 1/4th population but 7-8k infected and 100+ deaths reported daily.
23555,Same problem - deniers and fed up people who don't see the problem.
23556,I'm not really looking towards this year's Christmas Tree sale starting next week as I will be one of the cashiers.
23557,But it will be interesting to see how many people take it seriously.
23558,Government made a rule for shops to not exceed person limit 15m^2 (ie.
23559,in 150m^2 big shop can be only 10 people at once).

23586,"The second CVS starts allowing my group to get a vaccine, I will get it."

23603,"I know dozens who have had the virus, including a fucking cancer patient."
23604,I know two people who have been hospitalized for it.
23605,I only know one person in their 20s who was hospitalized for it: A morbidly obese relative of mine.
23606,"I don't know anyone who complained about ""lasting effects"" that didn't go away in 3 months tops."
23607,"Realistically, most people will have anecdotal experiences similar to me, where most people under 40 say they got sick a couple of days and were fine in a week."
23608,"Very few people will know ""multiple friends of yours in their 20’s and 30’s"" who got ""*really fucking sick*."""
23609,"Thanks for adding to the topic at hand, buddy!"
23610,Insect cannot get a virus like sars/covid from a human.
23611,That drug cocktail that saved the President's life was approved by the FDA for emergency usage pretty recently.
23612,Hopefully treatments for coronavirus will prevent us from getting that high.
23613,You forget that the vast majority are actually fully vaccinated from their childhood.
23614,It's the children that have no say that are at risk.
23615,It’s already super contagious 😷
23616,Thank you for making this point!
23617,Hospitals are already becoming overwhelmed.
23618,"Thanksgiving isn't going to show it's impact for 2-4 weeks from now, and by then the Hanukkah, Christmas and New Years infections will be well underway and they will start showing their impact 2-4 weeks after that."
23619,We need a miracle.
23620,"I agree that idiots should be able to make poor choices, however when that choice directly threatens my health (I'm high risk, as is my partner and my mother) they have no right to continue doing it, and that's where policing bodies should step in and force them to comply."
23621,"If they still really don't want to mask up, they can take advantage of delivery and curbside pickup options and limit their exposure to the general public."
23622,Managing this virus as a “slow burn” is tricky.
23623,It easily escalates out of control as a population relaxes seeing lower numbers.
23624,Places that put in the required sacrifice to stamp out the fire completely are in much better financial position long term.
23625,"""The virus likely made its way to the gathering through one family member whose job required her to work outside her home, Aragonez said."
23626,"That family member attended the event with symptoms which she thought were just allergies."""

23628,so that would be like using a condom you knew had holes in it
23629,Also look up the MERV rating for both in room filters and your home's AC.

23633,We have family planning (and have already paid for) vacations to Florida in first week of December.

23641,I want to lead with: I totally agree with your point.
23642,"*However*, I think that we are well past the point where masks + 6ft are going to slow this thing down."
23643,"I know so many people who honestly believe that they are ""taking this seriously"" and who post about mask wearing, etc."
23644,"on social media, but who will go hang out with friends inside, will go on a vacation, will have Thanksgiving gatherings with 5-6 households present."
23645,"Those are the activities that are driving the spread, and I frankly worry that too many people think ""masks + 6ft in public"" is enough."
23646,It's not.
23647,People can and should go to work (if they cannot work from home).
23648,People can and should go outside for exercise.
23649,And people can and should utilize curbside options to support local businesses.
23650,And people can and should go to the doctor.
23651,"Beyond that, people need to stay home."
23652,Just wearing a mask isn't good enough.
23653,Fair enough.
23654,I have to admit that I heard the thing about the Fed Gov seizing PPE but I missed the thing about the thing with the governor of MA having to sneak PPE like this.
23655,"It's amazing how his corruption is still surprising, even for people who already know how much of a corrupt p.o.s he is isn't it?"
23656,"Bottom line being, he didn't handle it in any *positive* way, even by being brain damaged and extremely lenient."
23657,According to the reports in the past days Pfizer and Moderna only tested those with symptoms where AZ/Oxford tested everyone.
23658,If that is accurate then there is no real comparison between the percentages as they are effectively measuring different things.
23659,Apparently I needed the /s
23660,Hopes dashed.
23661,Nobody cares in the USA about it because.....?
23662,I think we know the answer to this one.
23663,So?
23664,Im just talking about numbers of young people killed
23665,And they thought Labor Day would be a catalyst.. hello Thanksgiving!
23666,"elaborate ""little to no symptoms"" because that sounds like an oximoron"
23667,OH GOD
23668,"Meh, Korwin is not revelant."

23676,Sigh.
23677,I’m so tired of this.
23678,That'll teach them to pick themselves up by the bootstraps
23679,I wasn't aware that seasonal cold leads to CFS/ME.
23680,"With people out of work and small businesses set up to fail en masse, America has landed on its current contradiction: Tell people it’s safe to return to bars and restaurants and spend money inside while following some often useless restrictions, but also tell them it’s unsafe to gather in their home, where nothing is for sale."
23681,"It’s a woefully inadequate stimulus plan, funded by money extracted little by little from the pockets of people who are mostly just confused about what they’re being compelled to do."
23682,"Service workers—the people at highest risk of contracting the virus in restaurants, bars, and gyms—are rarely part of a union, which would make it easier for them to take collective action to protect themselves."
23683,"If they were, their situations might be closer to that of teachers in some cities, whose unions have won them strict protections, including the cancellation of in-person classes once local caseloads rise past predetermined rates."
23684,"Transparency, Kirk Sell told me, would go a long way toward helping people evaluate new restrictions and the quality and intentions of their local leadership."
23685,"“People aren’t sheep,” she said."
23686,"“People act rationally with the facts that they have, but you have to provide an understanding of why these decisions are being made, and what kind of factors are being considered.”

With that in mind, I asked Kirk Sell the question that’s been bothering me since I broke the news to my friend about the ineffectiveness of temperature checks and indoor partitions."
23687,Why can’t a governor or mayor just be honest?
23688,"There’s no help coming from the Trump administration, the local coffers are bare, and as a result, concessions are being made to business owners who want workers in restaurants and employees in offices in order to white-knuckle it for as long as possible and with as many jobs intact as possible, even if hospitals start to fill up again."
23689,"Saying so wouldn’t change the truth, but it would better equip people to evaluate their own safety in their daily life, and make better choices because of it."
23690,Kirk Sell stopped me short.
23691,"“Do you think it might be the end of their career, though?” she asked."
23692,“Probably.”
23693,This is the real reason for the delay?
23694,Ugh
23695,"Oh wow, I yet can't understand how some people don't understand the need to follow the appropriate procedures for this to end."
23696,"In my country, some people don't wear a mask and may act violently if asked about it."
23697,Some will constantly keep putting up and down like it was a hat.
23698,Yet the same people will protest if there is more lockdown or curfew because there is no other way to make them follow the procedures.
23699,"Well, those already demanded to be liability free from any damage the vaccines may cause."
23700,"They struck a pretty sweet deal - all of the profits, none of the responsibility!"
23701,"Josh was irritated, but not because of me."
23702,"If indoor dining couldn’t be made safe, he wondered, why were people being encouraged to do it?"
23703,Why were temperature checks being required if they actually weren’t useful?
23704,Why make rules that don’t keep people safe?
23705,"Across America, this type of honest confusion abounds."
23706,"While a misinformation-gorged segment of the population rejects the expert consensus on virus safety outright, so many other people, like Josh, are trying to do everything right, but run afoul of science without realizing it."
23707,"Often, safety protocols, of all things, are what’s misleading them."
23708,"In the country’s new devastating wave of infections, a perilous gap exists between the realities of transmission and the rules implemented to prevent it."
23709,"“When health authorities present one rule after another without clear, science-based substantiation, their advice ends up seeming arbitrary and capricious,” the science journalist Roxanne Khamsi recently wrote in Wired."
23710,"“That erodes public trust and makes it harder to implement rules that do make sense.” Experts know what has to be done to keep people safe, but confusing policies and tangled messages from some of the country’s most celebrated local leaders are setting people up to die."
23711,"Since my conversation with Josh, the internal logic of New York’s coronavirus protocols has deteriorated further."
23712,"As more and more New Yorkers have become sick, officials have urged people to skip Thanksgiving, because of the danger of eating indoors with people you don’t live with."
23713,"Rather than closing indoor dining, however, Cuomo has ordered all restaurants and bars simply to close by 10 p.m."
23714,"This curfew also applies to gyms, which are not exactly hotbeds of late-night activity even in normal times."
23715,"Meanwhile, case counts have risen enough to trigger the closure of New York City public schools, but businesses still have full discretion to require employees to come into work."
23716,(Cuomo’s office did not respond to a request for comment.)
23717,"Read: Answers to every possible pandemic-Thanksgiving question

It isn’t just New York; in states across the country, local officials have urged caution and fastidiousness."
23718,"But those words can seem tenuously connected, at best, to the types of safety measures they’ve put in place."
23719,"In Rhode Island, for example, residents are prohibited from gathering with even one person outside their household, even in the open air of a public park."
23720,But inside a restaurant?
23721,"Well, 25 people is fine."
23722,Hire a caterer?
23723,You’re legally cleared to have up to 75 outdoors.
23724,"The governor’s executive order merely notes: “The lower attendance at such events, the lower the risk.” (The Rhode Island governor’s office did not respond to a request for comment.)"
23725,"Before you can dig into how cities and states are handling their coronavirus response, you have to deal with the elephant in the hospital room: Almost all of this would be simpler if the Trump administration and its allies had, at any point since January, behaved responsibly."
23726,Early federal financial-aid programs could have been renewed and expanded as the pandemic worsened.
23727,Centrally coordinated testing and contact-tracing strategies could have been implemented.
23728,"Reliable, data-based federal guidelines for what kinds of local restrictions to implement and when could have been developed."
23729,The country could have had a national mask mandate.
23730,Donald Trump and his congressional allies could have governed instead of spending most of the year urging people to violate emergency orders and “liberate” their states from basic safety protocols.
23731,But that’s not the country Americans live in.
23732,"Responding to this national disaster has been left to governors, mayors, and city councils, basically since day one."
23733,"“You've got a lot of problems if every state has to develop everything from scratch,” Tara Kirk Sell, a researcher at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told me."
23734,"“First of all, it’s a lot of wasted time and money.” Instead of centralizing the development of infrastructure and methods to deal with the pandemic, states with significantly different financial resources and political climates have all built their own information environments and have total freedom to interpret their data as they please."
23735,"In the worst-case scenarios, that interpretation has privileged politics over the health of the population."
23736,"Vociferously Trump-allied governors in hard-hit states such as Georgia, Florida, and South Dakota have declined to so much as implement a public mask mandate while local caseloads have soared."
23737,"Sometimes, they have sparred with municipal leaders trying to do more."
23738,"In hard-hit El Paso, Texas, for example, a local stay-at-home order was recently overturned by a state court, even as local officials have had to call in refrigerated trucks to serve as makeshift morgues."
23739,"Read: Georgia’s experiment in human sacrifice

Even in cities and states that have had some success controlling the pandemic, a discrepancy between rules and reality has become its own kind of problem."
23740,"When places including New York, California, and Massachusetts first faced surging outbreaks, they implemented stringent safety restrictions—shelter-in-place orders, mask mandates, indoor-dining and bar closures."
23741,"The strategy worked: Transmission decreased, and businesses reopened."
23742,"But as people ventured out and cases began to rise again, many of those same local governments have warned residents of the need to hunker down and avoid holiday gatherings, yet haven’t reinstated the safety mandates that saved lives six months ago."
23743,"The pandemic is surging virtually everywhere in America; last week alone, it infected more than 1 million people and killed more than 8,000."
23744,"And yet indoor dining largely remains open, even as leaders warn of the very real perils of Thanksgiving dinner."
23745,"As time goes by, you'd think that local governments would get better at setting restrictions fine-tuned to protect people’s safety, not worse."
23746,But beneath this contradiction lies a fundamental conflict that state and local leaders have been forced to navigate for the better part of a year.
23747,"Amid the pandemic, the people they govern would generally be better served if they got to stay home, stay safe, and not worry about their bills."
23748,"To govern, though, leaders also need to placate the other centers of power in American communities: local business associations, real-estate developers, and industry interest groups."
23749,"These groups, whose businesses have cratered, have been vocal about their desire to see people go back to their jobs and pay their rent on time and in full."
23750,"Just as these kinds of groups have developed an outsize influence on how policies are made on a national level, they also have significant sway in state and local politics."
23751,The best way to resolve this conflict would probably be to bail out workers and business owners.
23752,"But to do that at a state level, governors need cash on hand; currently, most of them don’t have much."
23753,"The federal government, which could help states in numerous ways, has done little to fill state coffers, and has let many of its most effective direct-aid programs expire without renewal."
23754,"Those programs, such as expanded unemployment benefits and lump-sum relief checks, were so successful that they briefly prevented the poverty rate from rising at a time when more people than ever were suddenly out of work."
23755,"However effective these kinds of robust monetary programs may be at keeping people fed, housed, and safe, they are generally not in line with the larger project of the American political establishment, which favors bolstering “job creators” instead of directly helping those who might end up working those jobs."
23756,"If you make people safe and comfortable at home, it might be harder to make them risk their lives for minimum wage at McDonald’s during a pandemic."

23759,&gt;The actual article and Swedish authorities never claim Sweden has reached herd immunity.
23760,"No, but the headline doesn't say that either."
23761,"The headline says exactly what happened - Tegnell admitted there are no signs that herd immunity is having any effect on the spread of the virus, which is an admission that his earlier predictions were totally wrong."
23762,"Here is what Tegnell was saying only a few months ago:

&gt; “What we see right now is a rapid fall in the number of cases, and of course some kind of immunity has to be involved in that as nothing else has changed."
23763,"That means that immunity affects the R value quite a lot in Sweden today.” 

...

&gt; “I think it’s likely that those kinds of outbreaks will be easier to limit in Sweden because there is immunity in the population."
23764,"[https://unherd.com/2020/07/swedens-anders-tegnell-judge-me-in-a-year/](https://unherd.com/2020/07/swedens-anders-tegnell-judge-me-in-a-year/)

Of course, something had changed (the season) and immunity was much lower than he had been predicting, and now even he admits that there is no sign that immunity is affecting the spread of the virus."

Two weeks ago, I staged a reluctant intervention via Instagram direct message."
23780,"The subject was a longtime friend, Josh, who had been sharing photos of himself and his fiancé occasionally dining indoors at restaurants since New York City, where we both live, had reopened them in late September."
23781,"At first, I hadn’t said anything."
23782,"Preliminary research suggests that when people congregate indoors, an infected person is almost 20 times more likely to transmit the virus than if they were outside."
23783,"But restaurants are open legally in New York, and I am not the COVID police."
23784,"Josh and I had chatted several times in the early months of the pandemic about safety, and I felt sure that he was making an informed decision, even if it weren’t the one I’d make."
23785,"As weeks passed, my confidence began to slip."
23786,"The number of daily new cases in NYC started to balloon, heightening the risk of transmission in any closed space, but Josh kept going to restaurants."
23787,Maybe he was misunderstanding something about the risk.
23788,Maybe he’d want to know.
23789,"The next time he posted about COVID-19, I told him, as gently as I could, that if he was trying to stay safe, it would be a good idea to stop dining indoors."
23790,My suspicions were correct.
23791,"Because the state and city had reopened restaurants, Josh, who asked to be identified only by his first name to protect his privacy, assumed that local health officials had figured out a patchwork of precautions that would make indoor dining safe."
23792,"He and his fiancé had even gone one extra step, making a Google Map of places they knew were being particularly strict with temperature checks."
23793,They were listening to the people they were told to listen to—New York Governor Andrew Cuomo recently released a book about how to control the pandemic—and following all the rules.

23819,I have got a couple of questions if you don't mind me asking.
23820,1.
23821,"Is the majority of the country's population turning into anti-lgbt, women etc?"
23822,2.
23823,Is the constitution of the country structured in such a way to prevent measures that will cause permanent damage by the government?
23824,I would imagine firing judges should be made extremely difficult and a government shouldn't be able to easily kick them out.
23825,3.
23826,"By opposition, do you mean a complete coalition of many parties opposed against the ruling party with a fairly common ideology or many different parties with ideologies incompatible with each other?"
23827,Thanks for clarifying that you were talking about the names of the functions.
23828,"However, your complaints about pedantry are a bit hypocritical considering you are getting into the details of functions when the application that I talked about says the same and is not wrong."
23829,I stand by my statements contrary to popular belief.
23830,"Kids are very unlikely to have severe illness from covid, and schools across the world have continued to be open even now during lockdowns."
23831,The current vaccines also haven't been widely tested on kids from what I've read.
23832,Hey that's not true!
23833,"Credit where credit is due, he directed FEMA to seize PPE that was en route to certain states to the point where the Governor of MA had to enlist the Patriots NFL owner to secretly use their own airplane to fly it in under the radar."
23834,He also did a great job in starting a bidding war between states so random newly created PPE distribution companies could make a nice profit.
23835,To say he didn't do anything is just nonsense.
23836,He did a whole lot to help COVID spread through the country and weaken our response to it.
23837,"They will, *if* it's enforced."
23838,Now if you ask me if I'm sure it'll be enforced...
23839,I'm honestly not sure.

23899,The Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947 (Taft-Hartley) made union elections in the US a long drawn out adversarial process and had many ticking-time-bomb provisions which eventually devastated private-sector unionization.

*Despite the promising in vitro results that placed hydroxychloroquine among the leading candidates for Covid-19 treatment and prophylaxis,27-29 there are no compelling data to suggest that hydroxychloroquine is effective."

23928,I t’s worse than “what we’ve all felt”.
23929,I had to spend 2 hours on the phone with IT because from Friday to Monday I forgot how to log onto my computer.
23930,I can’t do basic math anymore.
23931,I’m a fucking engineer.
23932,"Well, until I get fired that is."
23933,"I am, for lack of a more correct way to put it, mentally disabled right now, and have been off and on since March."

23959,We're dying and no one pays attention.
23960,There are literally nothing to stop it.
23961,Just giving an example.
23962,"My mother got tested postive for Coronavirus 20 days ago and at the 10th night she got worse, we went to 3 hospitals and none of them had space."
23963,"One called us 2 days later, they said that they have one open bed and we can come, but she got better in home in two days."
23964,Just imagine it.
23965,She could die in that 2 days.
23966,Even in non-COVID times a lot of schools close residence halls during holidays so staff don’t have to work.
23967,It’s actually a huge burden for students who have nowhere to go.
23968,The university near us decided at the last minute to make the Spring semester remote so students who thought they were just taking a Thanksgiving break are now all moving.
23969,It’s really messed up.
23970,"Anyway, that does happen."
23971,"So i was recently positive, how long will the taste and smell loss last?"
23972,I really want to taste food again!
23973,"My company has had a very similar behavior, lots of areas where the decision making is a bit iffy, but at least responding to the pandemic they took it seriously  pretty much since March, with groups in every site determining if the local conditions are suitable for a return to site, and until now they've indicated that they don't anticipate a general return to the office until at least the second half of next year."
23974,I’d say it’s worse.
23975,Came to say this.
23976,Lots of misinterpreting of the article going on.
23977,"Normally fighting ignorance with knowledge is the right strategy, but these are not normal times."
23978,"Woah, that makes sense."
23979,People still aren’t taking this wave seriously.
23980,This is because most people don’t look at any statistics.
23981,"They judge solely on gut feeling and they think “well it wasn’t ww2 in March like they said it would be so why would it be now.”

They forget the forced lockdowns severely slowed the spread in the spring."
23982,Those lockdowns are no longer occurring due to economic reasonings.
23983,I know a guy who was in the hospital with COVID a couple weeks ago and died.
23984,"From what I heard, he got Regeneron but that didn't save him."
23985,"(I didn't know him very well, so this is assuming that the people who were closer to him got their facts straight.)"
23986,"In many spots, you only have one source to support your statements."
23987,"If you want the site taken seriously, then you should have many, many sources per statement and they should be more than just news pieces."
23988,I'm not sure who you think lied to you.
23989,"Politicians, maybe?"
23990,"Because there were certainly no infectious disease experts saying we were going to be done with this in a few months, or that anything was going to back to normal sooner than it has."
23991,The vast majority were warning that a fall surge was exactly what they expected to happen.
23992,"For context, I am a scientist and work in pharma."
23993,And this was exactly what I expected to happen (although I will say that I've been a bit caught off guard by the sheer idiocy/determined ignorance of a certain segment of the population).
23994,"I have not been to TX specifically in November, TX is also quite large."
23995,I worked for a company in Dallas-Fort Worth for a summer.

There is currently no pollen in the air, according to wunderground, in this area."
23998,It would not be reasonable for a person who did not generally get allergies to get them at this time in DFW.
23999,What are you allergic to that is in the air in November?
24000,"Yes, this is low."
24001,It's got to be at least 50%.
24002,"Even if people aren't traveling, they are gathering together with people / family they don't live with."
24003,"8pm, the polish arrived at home and had dinner ;)

yes it’s always “something else”."
24004,the excess death is what matters and compared to other month before covid the humber is apparently 300% so yes it’s related to covid.
24005,"indirect or direct, it’s because of covid, if covid wouldn’t be here, the death would be 2-3k lower."

24010,There is a discussion of causalities but there are no Top Decision Makers\* calling for other options other than invasion.
24011,"The Top Decision Makers may split hairs on how the invasion should work, but none of them are calling for other options."
24012,"Note, they did not know about the Manhattan project and the Atomic bombs."
24013,"&amp;#x200B;

24014,"Anyone with less than 3 stars is not a Top Decision Maker, they are an influencer at best."

24033,All of us nurses are in on it and complicit.
24034,/s
24035,right now most regions have the surge capacity in terms of bed space with MASH-type army units available.
24036,It's the healthcare staffing issue that's worrisome.
24037,When NY had its surge medical team from across the nation were flown in to help shore up their hospitals.
24038,But right now the 2nd wave is flooding the entire nation.
24039,"There aren't spare nurses and doctors, especially those who're trained in critical care."
24040,"Yeah among those who die, it says, myocarditis is common but you're claiming 4,000,000-10,000,000 (1/10 of the flu burden) Americans get myocarditis each year when a simple Google search shows less than 200,000 have myocarditis in a year."
24041,so when does immunity kick in when you're vaccinated?
24042,Yeah I’ll be proactive by getting a vaccine thanks

24134,By the way we were considered one of the worst in the world when it came to road deaths.
24135,Note that kind of death became intolerable for the public as everyone knew someone who died in a car crash ... if you had 6000 last month dying in a car crash in Texas you will have the entire state screaming blue murder.

24153,"And then came Thanksgiving,"
24154,Odds of immunity are MUCH higher than not taking the vaccine.

24163,I get that a lot of people have anecdotes about long covid but the way people act is like it's almost a certainty that it'll happen even to those who are asymptomatic or mild cases.
24164,"Personally, I know four people who have had covid, my cousin had a mild case, and two friends had moderate cases but recovered."
24165,None of them have lingering problems.

24174,The US economy isn't set up to deal with massive numbers of working-age people becoming suddenly unable to work long-term.
24175,"It *is* possible for people to get some money under [Social Security Disability Insurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_Disability_Insurance) (informally known as being ""on disability""), but most people can only qualify if they have almost no assets left, and the program is structured in a way that makes it very hard to financially get back into a regular life."
24176,"(I have heard from people on SSDI that it's hard because even if your health improves and you can work again, the means-testing is so strict that you cannot save up money while weaning yourself off the program.)"
24177,"So if the adenovirus is creating immunity to adenovirus making the second shot less effective, would a combined dose of two differently vectored vaccines be much more effective?"

24180,Is it Dangerous?
24181,Yes.
24182,Is it damaging?
24183,Yes.
24184,Is it as Dangerous/damaging as a lack of accountability from the very top?

24189,The last 4 years is proof that couldn't happen
24190,Odds are they'll try to forge the documentation.
24191,Unfortunately the only thing that will change minds is people losing someone close to them due to the virus.
24192,"Almost works that same way with the stigma of drug addiction - I’ve seen a lot of people spit on drug addicts, but when someone loses a relative to an OD their mind changes quickly and when it’s too little too late."
24193,"Pretty sure they're saying this just as a way of erring on the side of caution while we wait for vaccines to get distributed, nothing to do with it being ""rushed."""
24194,"Also, for non-Fauci health officials, especially those who are working for local govts, there's a certain CYA factor at play here."
24195,"Ultimately, in a worst-case scenario, we may have to keep around our masks through all of next year, but that doesn't necessarily mean it'll be more dangerous for people to gather for Thanksgiving next year than it is this year."
24196,[deleted]
24197,Honestly this is how a ton of people are acting.
24198,"They acknowledge the virus is dangerous, and one way to stop the spread is to stop going out to eat, stop having dinner parties, and stop traveling."
24199,And then as soon as that comes out of their mouth they go ahead and do one of those things because we're really good at justifying our own actions.
24200,"You can find the comments in almost any thread about lock-downs or traveling: ""I got a test so I know I don't have it, I can travel right?"
24201,""", ""It is a small multi family bubble, we trust each other to say something if they get symptoms"", ""the restaurant I got to takes it really seriously, every other booth is blocked and we have to wear masks until we are seated, isn't that safe?"""
24202,Tegnell clearly stated it in leaked internal emails.
24203,The Swedes are just gaslighting you
24204,I literally don't know who you're talking to...your post is incoherent.
24205,And for those of us who have have health care workers in their family that have to deal with aholes that keep infecting each other in pure selfishness.
24206,"Its NOT hard just to stay home to stop hurting other people...its not about the wedding of one pair of selfish, inhumane, idiots...its about the after effects to all the people have to clean up their mess."
24207,And honestly who the hell thinks its ok to hurt or kill their own family members...that's honestly sick.
24208,I don't care how you feel about my post...I honestly am hoping they start arresting people who keep doing this crap in the middle of a pandemic killing hundreds of thousands of people.
24209,Take off you hoser
24210,I never said it wasn't very damaging.
24211,I definitely agree there.
24212,I do however think there is a difference.
24213,I would hope so.
24214,"It isn't problematic until you find our your friend stopped for gas on the way over, touched the pump, picked up corona, and then all 3 of you are positive in 5 days."
24215,"It isn't problematic to anyone, until personally effected."
24216,This is why it is such a huge fucking problem for us selfish americans.
24217,I’m sorry I assumed your experience was not severe.
24218,I have had lots of people IRL say that to me and I kind of projected that onto you.
24219,"Sorry about that, and about your experience."
24220,That sounds very similar to my experience and makes me wonder if you aren’t recovering from covid.
24221,Is that a possibility?
24222,I couldn’t track the plot of a 20-minute sitcom episode for months.
24223,I felt like my IQ went from 140 to 70.
24224,I guess we can forget about traveling for Christmas now huh?
24225,These jerks ruined it for all of us.
24226,I live in a ski town in Colorado.
24227,There are tons of tourists here with their families taking advantage of thanksgiving skiing.
24228,"I understand the need to stay home for thanksgiving, but how is it logical to tell locals to stay home for thanksgiving while encouraging out of towners to visit and ski?"
24229,Seems like a double standard to me.
24230,You can’t expect people to stay home while also convincing them hosting tourists is “safe”.
24231,I just don’t get it.
24232,Are you serious?
24233,"I'm not from denver so don't know this idiot at all, but how the eff do you spout all this important stuff, but then disregard it yourself?"
24234,Shouldn't be in a leadership position.
24235,Make it so people have to work to find it.
24236,Right now propaganda and misinformation work to find supporters.
24237,"Fox news, OANN, and Facebook algorithm come to mind."
24238,Broad access focused misinformation needs to go.
24239,"If they want to hide in their little Parler app and Stormfront boards, whatever."
24240,Chip me up baby
24241,&gt; I know some will be angry at me for saying this - but this type of hypocrisy is just as damaging as Trump not wearing a mask.
24242,Because that's a ridiculous statement.
24243,The president of the united states lying and not wearing a mask for months and months when it would have made a huge difference is way way more impactful than the mayor of denver no one has ever heard of giving good advice and then not following it.
24244,Work on your crowd work some more before you debut your set
24245,Title is a little misleading.
24246,"Reading the article, it doesn't appear that he brandished the knuckles and threatened anyone with them."
24247,"He was in the process of being escorted from the store by a police officer when he ""pulled them out""."
24248,"Not bright, and not the bet situation; but not as bad as the headline made it sound."
24249,If he had just put on a mask when asked or just left; none of this would have happened.
24250,[When Two Pandemics Meet: Why Is Obesity Associated with Increased COVID-19 Mortality?
24251,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7323660/)
24252,Traveling around minimum two major international travel hubs and subjecting yourself to exposure of 1000’s of people (every tenth person in CO has a 25% chance of having COVID) and then visiting family is as dangerous as not wearing a mask.
24253,Huh?
24254,[deleted]
24255,Cooking a big turkey and eating leftovers until Christmas :D
24256,...
24257,This right here is the dumbest comment I’ve seen today.
24258,You’re the type of moron to see a photo of young hitler and say “look he’s hot!” completely unprompted.
24259,What the fuck is wrong with you?
24260,And you don’t have to “kNoW so MUcH AbOuT LEaDeRsHiP” to know that SD is fucked and it’s all her fault.
24261,Are you actually Kristi Noem?
24262,Because I legitimately can’t see why someone would be like “lol look how hot she is and she’s totally doing a good job!!
24263,!” otherwise.
24264,This isn't true though.
24265,We don't know whether the vaccine stops asymptomatic spread yet and evidence from earlier trials is indicating that it probably doesn't.
24266,"So, R0 could stay relatively high, but people just won't care if they're vaccinated."
24267,"yep, and as you can read, nobody knew about it."
24268,it’s a silent news embargo by just not publishing actual information to big media outlets...
24269,Oh well
24270,I drove from Steamboat Springs to Corpus Christi...but I love driving and did take a nap along the way.
24271,But either way he shouldn’t be flying.
24272,"&gt;Most nations’ leadership culture seems to suffer from the same arrogance - trying to hide bad news because they always want to look strong and perfect

Sadly."
24273,&gt;This isn’t just a Turkey problem for sure.
24274,Leadership of the world needs to mature and realize it is not a shame to be honest with citizens and humanity about trouble and problems.
24275,"%100 agreeing but in Turkey, things got a lot worse."
24276,It should be a warning sign for the other countries.
24277,&gt;I have extended family struggling to get proper non-covid health care because all hospitals are very busy with covid patients.
24278,Its unsettling.
24279,That sucks.
24280,Hoping health to all of them.
24281,In the US you could report them to the FTC for making false health claims.
24282,Is there something similar in the UK?
24283,People going to their jobs was not a subject of this article at all.
24284,"It's all about people's optional behavior - no one HAS to get together with friends or other non-household members, but by the millions, we are continuing to do so."
24285,Not that I wouldn't completely support paying as many people as possible to stay home - that only makes sense - but the real driver of this pandemic is the poor choices people are making in terms of socializing.
24286,[removed]
24287,"I can understand it as a way to ease tension and maybe prevent protests, but this is probably going to result in more get togethers."
24288,"As for less damage done, who knows anything at this point."
24289,Article title is blatantly false when discussing total death rate.
24290,"It may be discussing 7 or 14 day rolling, but it should say that."
24291,I don’t even see that in the article itself.
24292,"Us states by deaths per 100,000, ranked."

24307,"ah yeah, been already a month... time flies."
24308,hasn’t done much difference then...
24309,I was thinking of the latest restrictions 2 weeks ago with malls also closed.
24310,Stay Classy.
24311,Why post the article when it's able to be read easily via the link to the site?
24312,"Yeah, Taft-Hartley also included a provision where union officers had to file affidavits with the Department of Labor declaring they weren't communists."
24313,18 years later this was found unconstitutional as a bill of attainder.
24314,"What exactly do you mean by New World Order and Great Reset there, buddy?"
24315,You tell me.
24316,For all I know I have it right now and all I did was go to rhe grocery store.
24317,Likely won’t be able to taste at all
24318,Mine lasted about a month and a half.
24319,"Just popped back one day when I was cooking and I was like *""Shit, I'm actually going to ENJOY cooking today!"
24320,"""*."
24321,FUCK anyone who thinks we can just live side by side with a deadly virus.
24322,"It really depends, typically the smell/taste loss is caused by nerve damage due to inflammation and can take a really long time to heal."
24323,A friend of mine had his mostly back a month after testing positive but my mom still doesn't have hers back all the way from a bad cold over a year ago.
24324,&gt; They can't make a profit if their vaccine doesn't work and isn't safe.
24325,"Ahaha, the naivete is unbelievable."
24326,How many times do you have to be wrong to see your mistakes?
24327,&gt; Motives don't have to be a factor.
24328,:D Insanity.
24329,"&gt;  If you can trust the vaccine testing and approval process

I don't know."
24330,There is too much at stake and the profits involved are too hefty.
24331,"&gt; and the vaccine works and is safe, then I don't care why people created it."
24332,I do.
24333,I'm sorry for your future losses.
24334,"I hope the grieving period is as painless for you as possible, but that you also hold it over the rest of your families heads for the rest of your life."
24335,Surprised he didn't melt
24336,I agree.
24337,"Of course it doesn’t have nearly as far the reach, however."
24338,Why are people like this?
24339,Putting a mask on takes like half a second
24340,"Oh, considering the attitudes of folks near me, I’m surprised my back yard wasn’t piled with dead bodies by now."
24341,"Small town, anti-maskers, Covid deniers...current infection rate is 1 in 63."
24342,And that’s just the small percentage that get tested.
24343,"Based on the local FB chatter, the real number is closer to 1 in 24."
24344,"Japan doesn't have many morbidly obese, science-denying religious fanatics."
24345,For the hospital I work for both staffing and space would be an issue.
24346,Travelers aren’t always easy to come by and are very expensive.
24347,"Right now with the whole country needing them, they’re not coming to us in huge numbers."
24348,Physical room can be hard too because we’re in a city and can’t take over any space around us.
24349,"You can’t always build up or on in buildings that are a hundred years old, and you can’t just move to another location because then you’re not within the community that needs to be served."
24350,"A lot of places have surge plans in place, but they’re not always as functional in reality as they are in theory, or work at all for covid."
24351,"We had to submit plans for minimum 50% surge and 100% surge and we have a plan on paper-using the OR, PACU, pediatric ward, etc., but we would never have the staff to actually use it-especially for any amount of real time."
24352,Maybe for a day or two but not for weeks.
24353,It’s really more of a staffing issue than anything.
24354,"The icu occupancy rate-I’m on mobile so some of it is hard to decipher, but are those rates based on their normal number of beds or their surge number of beds?"
24355,It’s all location also.
24356,A state may have capacity in one location and not another.
24357,"Transfers can happen, but transferring critical patients isn’t easy, cheap or safe."
24358,We took 30 patients from NYC in the spring.
24359,Hundreds of miles away because we were empty and they were packed.
24360,"It happened, but it’s far from ideal."
24361,It’s better to control the spread than to put that many stresses on the system.
24362,"I get what your saying, but it’s a bit like planning for a hurricane."
24363,You can only do so much because you really don’t know exactly when or how hard it will hit.
24364,Because flu epidemics become unable to sustain epidemic growth at about 10% immunity.
24365,"Flu is a respiratory virus, so is sars-cov-2."
24366,These people don't believe in anything but fomite and close-range droplet splatter as infection vector.
24367,"It's the flu strategy - try to hit 10% without any vulnerable individuals being infected, and the epidemic just goes away."
24368,"The Tegnell-school thought the threshold might very well be higher than 10%, but they were sure we would hit it eventually and it would end."
24369,"This does not work for covid-19 due to high infection variance, higher than expected IFR/CFR, aerosol infection and asymptomatic carriers - but sunk cost fallacy is a tough opponent, so they're still waiting for the magic threshold."
24370,"The fact that wave 2 hit Sweden \*harder\* than the rest of Scandinavia has really been a gut punch to the flu strategy, because it means that no only is there no sign of being near the magic threshold, they essentially look to be back at square one."
24371,Which is what Asian experts - who know sars and this family of coronaviruses - have been saying all along.
24372,You can't slow-burn through this.
24373,It'll just become endemic.
24374,"However, we have had seasonal flu and common cold for so long that the idea of eradicating a respiratory virus seems insane and unnecessary to many western (but especially Scandinavian) academics."
24375,It's going to be a tough sell if containment is necessary.
24376,"We've forgotten how to do that, and what it requires."
24377,"Yeah, when I read/hear comments from doctors and other scientists, I get very anxious."
24378,"When the general public hears the same message, they assume it is fear mongering, and shrug it off."
24379,The lack of basic understanding of science and math will be devastating to communities that are already having difficulty with this pandemic.
24380,"I’m afraid there will be a bunch of doctors and nurses that will quit and leave their position, when the patients need them most."
24381,The PTSD among medical professional will be severe.
24382,[removed]
24383,Dude she is smoking hot.
24384,So now we get to add assault with a deadly weapon to his charges huh?
24385,"well, in all fairness, it *is* a pandemic."
24386,What else you gonna do besides drink alone?
24387,!
24388,Im referring to her looks and not her job.
24389,"Move to SD and see how it goes for you, then, since you know so much about leadership and love to accuse people of being murderers."
24390,Maybe you can set an example?
24391,That's a lot of people dying.
24392,When will the remaining restrictions be removed?
24393,New Zealand and Australia opened up pretty damn quickly after a a few weeks of no cases.
24394,"Dropped mask mandates, allow tens of thousands into stadiums, etc."
24395,"&gt; Overall, the Oxford-AstraZeneca trials appear to include relatively few participants over the age of 55, even though this group is especially vulnerable is Covid-19."
24396,"uhhhh, that's not a good sign."
24397,[removed]
24398,I've already been doing that for 9 months since if we all did it this would have been no big deal.
24399,"Thanks to my ""fellow Americans"" it has made no difference."
24400,"Not that I'll stop doing it, but screw everyone who hasn't."
24401,It's being collected in their UK study though I think you're right that it wasn't part of their interim analysis.
24402,"&gt;In addition, weekly swabbing are done for detection of infection and assessment of vaccine efficacy against infection."
24403,"https://www.astrazeneca.com/content/astraz/media-centre/press-releases/2020/azd1222hlr.html

The US trial protocol mentions monitoring periodic blood samples for asymptomatic infections."
24404,"Listen: I shop at Walmart sometimes, so this isn't a judgment per se, but if THIS AIN'T THE MOST WALMART SHIT TO HAPPEN.....jfc."
24405,"TLDR: Sales are stopped from 5pm Wednesday until 8am Thursday, with the exception of deliveries."
24406,The hypocrisy isn’t the real issue here.
24407,"Think about it: 

If you *genuinely* believe that traveling or celebrating Thanksgiving with more than the people who already live with you is at ALL likely to lead directly to people (you or others) dying, do you do those things?"
24408,"Approximately 15 seconds of reading comments here by people who *genuinely believe that getting together for Thanksgiving will kill people* should answer that for you: no, you absolutely don’t."
24409,"These politicians are being hypocrites, sure, but so what - that’s pretty expected of them."
24410,The point that matters here is that they clearly don’t believe what they’re saying about the risks of covid - because even the most selfish person doesn’t do X if they genuinely believe that X is likely to kill them or someone they love.
24411,"I have never been a staunch “America is the best, freeeeedom!” type of guy, especially having lived abroad in a more socialist leaning country."
24412,I have enjoyed the upward mobility the US does allow though.
24413,What has come into stark view through this pandemic is that we need to reign in the mentality of this country.
24414,"I don’t think it can happen quickly, but adopting even an iota of East Asian culture into our own could help to temper the great disregard for society (ie: anyone other than yourself) that has become so rampant in recently years."
24415,What I can say is that I am glad to live in a state that has a strong governor who actually cares about her people and is fighting against those who would put their misplaced unscientific thinking ahead of their friends / family / neighbors.
24416,"Off topic a bit, but as as a geologist how do you see future pandemics coming about?"
24417,What I have seen is that the forcing of nature to come into closer contact with humans (for the multitude of enabling factors) will almost guarantee more future pandemics like this.
24418,"Also, what is your take on how much worse global climate change could potentially be than COVID-19?"
24419,"I fear that when we start seeing the “smack you in the face” level of proof that it is upon us, the way out will not be as simple as a vaccine."
24420,That's just mean.
24421,"I'm ok with a lockdown, but I can't face my aunt sober on Thanksgiving 😂"
24422,"If Florida was a country, it would have the 6th highest deaths per capita, including microstates San Marino and Andorra."
24423,Removing those would make it 4th highest.
24424,The fact that Florida ranks 15th amongst states in deaths per capita just shows how poorly the country as a whole has done combating COVID-19.
24425,"Also, [Florida's own hospital dashboard](https://bi.ahca.myflorida.com/t/ABICC/views/Public/HospitalBedsCounty?%3AshowAppBanner=false&amp;%3Adisplay_count=n&amp;%3AshowVizHome=n&amp;%3Aorigin=viz_share_link&amp;%3AisGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y&amp;%3Aembed=y) shows 22% ICU capacity and 25% total bed capacity, not 34%."
24426,You mean like the tribal leaders that she forbid to take their own action to protect themselves?
24427,They’d have done better without Noem’s mommying.
24428,Thats a lot of people flying
24429,So?
24430,Same can be said about literally every other disease on the planet.
24431,I would sooner die than permanently mask and social distance.
24432,visiting my aunt and her friend in the next town over.
24433,everyone has been isolating for a week so we're thinking it's pretty safe.
24434,then it's booze and watching football all weekend to celebrate the end of my fall semester.

24484,Idk where he’s been at college lmao.
24485,Continue to ignore that which is in front of your very own eyes just because you bought into that conspiracy theories.
24486,It really shows your lack of critical thinking and intelligence.
24487,Good bait
24488,"Infection of covid through surfaces is extremely, extremely rare."
24489,Just wash your hands.
24490,Your freedom ends at the point where your aerosolized sputum hits my nose.
24491,I've read that as of late last week holiday travel was only 10% less than the year prior.
24492,TEN PERCENT!
24493,That's during a worldwide pandemic at it's worst point to date in our country.
24494,Our education system has failed our country.
24495,And it is not teachers fault.
24496,"In fairness 50% is the bare minimum, we shouldn't be settling for that when we have others proven to be 90% effective."
24497,"I know logistics and cost make the Oxford vaccine more attractive, but it's not right to give poorer countries a weaker vaccine when we have access to a very good one."
24498,Most schools require freshmen to live on campus and quite a few also require sophomores to live on campus so that's at least 1/4 of college students who live in campus and I'd be willing to bet that once you include frats and sororities it is close to half of all college students that live in housing the school is in charge of.
24499,"With current [airport traffic information](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/11/22/world/covid19-coronavirus) and survey data indicating that 20-30% of the US population will ignore CDC guidelines against in person Thanksgiving gatherings, a post-Thanksgiving surge of COVID-19 is not a 'potential' surge."
24500,It's going to happen.
24501,Some areas of the country are already on the verge of a humanitarian crisis.
24502,By Christmas a lot of places in the U.S. will be in the midst of such as crisis.
24503,Hospitals will use disaster triage protocols to allocate scarce resources.
24504,That's a horrifying prospect.
24505,"But it is not the only major crisis we are creating, collectively."
24506,So far the U.S. economy appears to have largely defied gravity.
24507,"As the COVID medical crisis worsens between now and February, I expect that - absent government aid on a scale nobody in the federal government  has considered - we will fall into a deep recession and an unemployment crisis."
24508,[deleted]
24509,And another study it cites states that the covid patients studied were hospitalized between 3 and 5 days and ALSO cautioned that there's not enough data to say definitively if the longer term complications were due to covid or something else and that more data needs to be compiled.
24510,"Please also read this article

https://sebastianrushworth.com/2020/11/17/what-is-long-covid/"
24511,They're being unnecessarily douchey but I agree with the basic sentiment.
24512,Work is work.
24513,Friends and family are separate.
24514,"If they happen to overlap a bit, that's fine."
24515,But I hate this idea of best friends being coworkers.

24527,"I was in a thrift store two days ago, some guy rolls in with a netting from a turkey over his whole head, asked to leave or put an actual mask on, he throws a fit  and smacks a sign on his way out as hard as he could knocking it to the ground."

2) those things are worthless unless you can actually land a punch, and dough boy looks like he'd be huffing and puffing inside of 10 seconds"
24589,The best argument is you getting the vaccine yourself then when the skeptics see your fine then they will be more willing to take it
24590,That seems like a sane and appropriate response.

24607,&gt;Your understanding of this is embarassing to read.
24608,Literally simplistic cliches and no ability to think.
24609,What a shame an adult can be this stupid.
24610,I apologize that I tried to keep it simple for someone who clearly has no understanding of why a company wouldn't want to contribute to the shrinking of their customer base.
24611,"Be stupid, that is fine, but don't go all r/iamsosmart because your high school economics teacher talked about how bad big pharma is and how the world would run better under the leadership of the righteous and just Lord Putin."
24612,He may change his mind on the mask.
24613,It's the best way to sneak past security.
24614,Most people share dorm rooms and a lot of halls only have 1 or 2 bathrooms or floor so it is like 10+ people to a bathroom in the vast majority of college dorms I've seen the layout of (often over 20 people).
24615,And at some schools the rooms are so small there isn't even room to walk around.
24616,"Hell most of the rooms at the school I went to are a lot bigger, but there were a few weird ones where if you extended your arms your hands would be over beds on both sides and those were 3 people to a room!"
24617,The phrase things being canceled is getting really old!!
24618,"LOL Why can't we just say, Modified Thanksgiving?!"
24619,CDC!?
24620,LOL
24621,"They clearly said likely, not somewhat likely."
24622,I can assure you that these people are not likely to wear their masks regardless of what they’re telling Gallup to make themselves seem more reasonable.
24623,Nunchucks became popular due to kung fu movies and the blacksploitation films that followed.
24624,Butterfly knives became popular because switchblades were becoming illegal.
24625,"As for brass knuckles, I've never actually seen them in real life that weren't really just a fancy bottle opener keychain for underage bros."
24626,"Lower than I thought, not bad Americans"
24627,I wonder what form that proof will take.
24628,"Currently the only internationally recognized proof of vaccination is the yellow fever certificate, which is written by hand and easy to fake."
24629,It’s only going to get worse.
24630,There’s nothing that can be done.
24631,People have traveled.
24632,Thanksgiving is tomorrow.
24633,Hospitals are already overwhelmed.
24634,"It’s now just time to buckle down wherever you are, stay home if you can and ride out the winter."

24638,"I have a family member who had covid, he’s tested positive for the antibodies and it’s been several weeks since he had symptoms."
24639,"He’s returned to daily life and is now acting invincible to the virus bc of his antibodies which, to a certain extent, I understand, but he’s planning on spending thanksgiving with our elderly parents which I have very strongly urged against."
24640,He is not socially distancing (hanging out with friends) and I’m concerned he could spread it to others even if he himself has immunity.
24641,Am I being crazy?
24642,"It’s amazing how few people working in ICUS across the nation actually GET IT, that COVID-19 is a hoax."

24647,"The “goalposts” aren’t moving, they are “return to general normalcy”."
24648,It would be ridiculous to suggest we should give up just because the situation isn’t living up to our arbitrary timeline
24649,"don't write that too much, Automod's watching  lol"
24650,Exactly.
24651,Excess deaths take months to be added in the database.
24652,guess this catholic missed the mask message from the pope
24653,"&gt; North Dakota has 167 COVID-19 cases per 100,000, while Wyoming has 140 coronavirus infections per 100,000, followed by South Dakota with **124,000 cases per 100K**

Herd immunity right there"
24654,This is such a stupid stupid take that gets repeated over and over again like that makes it more true.
24655,It's not true for me.
24656,It's not true for my parents who don't even know what a reddit is.
24657,It's not true for my wife or her sister.
24658,It's not true for many many people.
24659,Yet all of us and many more people are making decisions based on reason and empathy.
24660,"Additionally, we aren't in the 1980s anymore."
24661,People of all persuasions use the internet and social media.
24662,Not just introverted nerds in their mom's basement.
24663,I understand this is an emotional time and it's tempting to want to make an emotional decision.
24664,"However, there have been experts in our face 24/7 for last 8 months providing recommendations for the best course of action."
24665,"At this point, there is no excuse."
24666,The knowledge is in our hands.
24667,"You haven't a clue, that much is obvious."
24668,Bet you voted for Biden and not Bernie Sanders.
24669,"Oh right, the system is rigged that way and you don't get a choice."
24670,Won't happen long term
24671,I’m fairly content in the knowledge that the kinds of people who spout that this is a bad thing tend not to be in the position to go on long haul flights in the middle of economic turmoil
24672,Exponents are absolutely *basic* math.
24673,They are a simple extension of the absolute baseline of being able to do multiplication.
24674,"Any adult who does not generally understand how exponents work should feel deeply embarrassed, or absolutely livid at how completely the education system has failed them."
24675,"I get that something more advanced like calculus is quite a challenge for a lot of students, and it's a fairly rare occasion indeed, when it might come in handy IRL for the vast majority of people."
24676,But freaking exponents?
24677,"You really should expect better from your education system and your countrymen, if you think exponents are a ""high-hanging"" fruit in math education."
24678,The concept of Checks and Balances is high-hanging fruit in civics?
24679,The Carbon cycle is high-hanging fruit in biology?
24680,The structure of the Atom is high-hanging fruit in chemistry?
24681,The Civil War is high-hanging fruit in history?
24682,Give me a break.
24683,"God this article is insufferable 

Firstly they call a “handful” of patients a “trend.” That is not a trend."
24684,That’s what you’d call outliers.
24685,"Then this:

&gt; 40% and 50% of percent of Covid-19 patients develop neurological or psychiatric problems while they are still in the hospital

Ok so we’re only talking about those that were hospitalized."
24686,A tiny tiny tiny fraction of those that get covid end up hospitalized.
24687,"My sister is insisting on having it still, and I honestly can't believe it, she's usually level headed, but she thinks we see these people anyway what's it matter if we get them all in one house, and I'm terrified"
24688,why couldn't they simply blur out the faces as they did in the Italy footage?...
24689,They listened to him [the first time around.](https://youtu.be/PRa6t_e7dgI?t=19).
24690,"&gt;Fauci: Right now in the United States, people should not be walking around with masks."
24691,"#
Dr Jon LaPook: **You're sure of it?"
24692,Because people are listening really closely to this.
24693,"**
#
Fauci: Right now people should- there's no reason to be walking around with a mask."
24694,"When you're in the middle of an outbreak, wearing a mask might make people feel a little bit better and it might even block a droplet, but it's not providing the perfect protection that people think that it is."
24695,Perhaps he should have chosen his words more carefully when they mattered most.
24696,I’m fairly certain his 89 year old mother lives in Albany and him and his daughters were headed there for the holiday.
24697,I’d have to read the story again to make sure.
24698,We are learning that a huge group of people in this country are sheep.
24699,"wait, we already knew that."
24700,A bit before there was another poll that showed about 40% of Americans getting together with at least ten people for Thanksgiving.
24701,That's about 130 million people...
24702,If even only ten percent of those tables spread the virus there could be upwards of 13 million more cases.
24703,Doubling our current case count from one event?
24704,That's mind boggling.
24705,Are you allowed to wear a mask yourself if you choose to?
24706,Try to get as good a mask as you can afford.
24707,I'd get myself a faceshield to go with it if I were you.
24708,Can you request to move to a cubicle farther from her?
24709,She sounds awful.
24710,Many people have resumed normal life already.
24711,Even most of the most cautious will with a vaccine.
24712,We accept thousands of flu deaths each year (we could really bring it down if more people would get flu shots).
24713,It’s not possible to fully eliminate death from the world.
24714,No it doesn’t.
24715,Very low is not zero.
24716,https://sebastianrushworth.com/2020/11/17/what-is-long-covid/
24717,"it's easier and less frightening to treat it like nothing more than the flu, to claim it's overblown and not a big deal."
24718,"to admit otherwise takes courage and effort, two things these people do not have because it's never been asked of them before."
24719,"Why don't these people start yelling about ""muh rights!!!"""
24720,when Walmart requires them to wear pants in the store?
24721,It's the same exact thing - a rule about hygiene that protects everyone from each other's germs.
24722,That's actually a really good idea!
24723,~Oh there’s no place like (the funeral) home for the holidays~
24724,"They all had customer facing jobs, first responders etc but were told to not do things differently than they were before the shot, iirc"
24725,"To be fair, you can do Black Friday shopping from home."
24726,My partner and I have been quarantining together since it got too warm to safely see people outdoors.
24727,"You can safely exchange gifts with whoever you share a home with 😊

Edit: meant too cold"
24728,I can't even imagine what it's like to be be a hospital worker dealing with all your patients dying.
24729,yep at first for my org it was temporary and now it's permanent (for IT at least).
24730,the recommendation post covid is 1 day a week on site but everyone that can work from home is expected to.
24731,"nobody, even our CIO, will have a permanent office"
24732,Totally agree.
24733,I've seen this attitude elsewhere.
24734,"I get that work is work, and I don't rely on it as my social outlet, but if I'm working with people 8+ hours a day, I am eventually going to befriend somebody."
24735,It's human nature.
24736,"Not only that, but work social events often lead to meeting other people whom you don't work with (maybe a buddy of a coworker), which often leads to more friendships or romantic relationships."
24737,This isn't an either/or thing.
24738,Socializing with coworkers is an added perk that some of us enjoy.
24739,Every interaction with another human being is an opportunity for friendship.
24740,Colleges really *should* make annual flu shots mandatory.
24741,I managed to get the fucking flu during finals week one year.
24742,That was... fun :-/
24743,Lmao
24744,"Unironically, yes."
24745,Especially in central Ohio there’s areas that are 100% reliant on the local Walmart for basically everything.
24746,That’s all she’s got.
24747,"Sounds like the study was misinterpreted and then twisted by ""muh rights"" people."
24748,The point is that wearing a mask incorrectly or not at all does not mean a mask itself is worse or not helpful rather points to people being stupid or ignorant.
24749,"Every point made about masks making things ""worse"" has strictly fallen on the individual being horrible in compliance or discipline."
24750,I wouldn't be surprised this same lot can't even follow social distancing rules either.
24751,If they refuse a vaccine then our hospitals (Canada) should refuse to help them once they come down with covid.
24752,Simple solution.
24753,"Can't afford to, now can I?"
24754,[removed]
24755,Wow.
24756,"I’m not trying to argue, and I never claimed I knew anything."
24757,I’m not an expert.
24758,"But if you say something with certainty, please back it up with a source as common courtesy, as things are changing all the time."
24759,Get a grip.
24760,When does the taste/smell come back?
24761,Cooking is a huge part of my life and I can’t imagine the loss of it.
24762,I’m also trying to gain size/weight and nothing is appetizing I’ve been resorting to just drinking protein shakes with oatmeal in it..
24763,There’s that predictable 30% again.
24764,Those aren't vaccines.
24765,Nope this is the truth and we want to recall his ass for it.
24766,3000 deaths today???
24767,?
24768,"Aggressively fear mongered virus, and as expected response from the elites per the usual."
24769,If you donate blood through the Red Cross you get the antibody test for free.
24770,I got my results about 5 days later.
24771,"As for the blood donation itself, I was in and out of the building inside of 30 minutes."
24772,[deleted]
24773,Lol.
24774,I absolutely love how you’re downvoted for saying a female is cute.
24775,"Especially one who is very much indeed cute, so not sure the hivemind’s reasoning on this one."
24776,Nobody gets Covid from a gas pump handle.
24777,We have my parents and my husband's parents coming tomorrow to eat as we are exposed to them weekly anyways for childcare reasons.
24778,We wear masks as well.
24779,And I stress about THAT.
24780,"I'm sorry but there's 18 people in this photo, that is not a ""small family gathering""."
24781,I don't ever wish anyone ill and I hope they all recover but small family gathering my ass.
24782,He was actually traveling to Albany to see them but same concept.
24783,"He cancelled, and rightfully so."
24784,But he certainly made the plans and only changed them yesterday.
24785,Get back to me in spring.
24786,"When a vaccine is still not available to the young &amp; healthy, you'll tell me you knew all along."
24787,So much for it going away after election day...

24796,"&gt; The group of parents cited data which said that out of more than 140,000 COVID tests among teachers and students since mid-October, just 308 have come back positive."
24797,&gt; That's a positivity rate of only 0.23%.
24798,I can see their point.
24799,I live in an area that has taken COVID rather seriously and implemented pretty stringent school operating procedures.
24800,"If the case load is low and the schools are actively managing the risk, it's a reasonable request."
24801,"That said, the kids are only in school for another few weeks before Christmas break and it seems dangerous to throw them back into a communal setting right after Thanksgiving and before Christmas."
24802,Tough call.
24803,"May he rest in peace and my condolences

America doesn't give a damn about these people."
24804,You think they care those people are dying?
24805,"Healthcare, schooling, good jobs, etc are missing in minority areas."
24806,You thought the pandemic would change racial disparity?
24807,Actually they aren’t if you read the story.
24808,It’s the plan that is coming next week.
24809,"I never went home for thanksgiving when I was in college, and this was years before the pandemic."
24810,I have friends who’s college aged children aren’t going home for thanksgiving this year and their kids are less than an hour away.
24811,There’s certainly a choice.
24812,100%.
24813,People don't deal with hardship well and when it's on such a massive scale they find it easier to deny it exists.
24814,It's too scary to acknowledge that we're living through a pandemic that is dangerous to a lot of us.
24815,Also to Cuomo in NY getting caught inviting his mom and sisters over for Thanksgiving.

24824,"When NYC locked down, we saw a rapid drop in daily deaths (2-3 weeks later), which was forced on the public."

24833,And so is managing the people traveling been boroughs.
24834,"Given the sheer amount of people traveling home for Thanksgiving (and presumably Christmas) and the rising cases in Staten Island, I don't feel great about the inevitable case rate surge coming this winter."

24838,I think that depends on your circle of information.
24839,"So one can’t extrapolate personally on whether or not it’s been downplayed or hyped up, so I won’t say anything to that degree."
24840,But there is a lack of punch you get from spelling constant doom.
24841,"You can’t make people feel helpless, otherwise they turn nihilistic."
24842,"If this is inevitable, then why even try?"
24843,That’s why extreme pragmatism is the best course imo.
24844,"Never make sweeping claims, never state anything as truth, as we have seen time and time again, we get things wrong and iterate upon them."
24845,"So people should be quite excited for the vaccine in this case, since the news we’re getting is positive, but we should also remember that it isn’t really true until it happens, and until it does, prepare accordingly."
24846,I keep seeing the word ‘jab’ associated with the vaccines.
24847,Anyone know what this means?
24848,"Take the 5+ hours a week you save on commuting, and join a social club!"
24849,We did the same in Aus.
24850,"We had masks + distancing + work from home if poss, and it was receding but ever so sloooowly."
24851,We actually had to progress to a serious lockdown for months to get to zero cases.
24852,Some Walmart stores ill even give you a free disposable mask as you go in.
24853,They need security in all their stores at this point.
24854,People really enjoy misbehaving in a Walmart.
24855,Well that's legitimately terrifying.
24856,"The fact that Trump is ""literally Hitler"" but not sarcastically."
24857,"But more than that, the fact that literally Nazi Germany propaganda works on Americans (and the amount of people outside America that support Trump shows it would work elsewhere, too, even if only on less people)."
24858,It was honestly a great insight into Nazi Germany for me.
24859,I admit I didn't know too much about how all that happened.
24860,I was afraid for America with the election stuff happening but I didn't know it was that close to becoming the exact situation that created Nazi Germany.
24861,I think my point does still hold.
24862,"Hanging on to some stupid lie like that, those people dying from covid while still denying its existence, they would have to accept shattering their entire worldview in order to change their mind."
24863,The contradiction is too much so they just get mad / scared and yell at people instead of facing the truth.
24864,"If they do expand their worldview, they continue down the path of conspiracy because it upholds everything else they believe."
24865,"Really, it's just a long way to say they are in a cult and have already drank the koolaid."
24866,If anyone is wondering what this post is [referencing](https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/02/politics/pelosi-salon-visit-set-up/index.html).
24867,The article is very misleading.
24868,Only one of the people interviewed tested positive for the virus.
24869,"The doctor at the end even cautioned that they should get tested because this could be due to any other virus, even the flu."
24870,"Instead, the headline and most of the article communicates something different."
24871,"I agree people should wear masks and social distance as much as possible, the whole works."
24872,"But straight up covid deniers go wild when they see misleading stuff like this, they wave it around like it's proof that the virus is a lie."
24873,"At the end of the day, this virus has been around about a year, tops."
24874,"I have no reason to believe that anyone is suffering permanent damage, especially not in high percentages unless solid data shows that."
24875,Do people need to be taken seriously when they have complications?
24876,"Absolutely, nobody says they shouldn't."
24877,"However, again, the fact remains that the vast majority of people will never die or have post viral complications from covid."
24878,r/peopleofwalmart
24879,"Unfortunately, the sentiment is out there."
24880,"A close family member just died of an initially mysterious ailment (turned out to be a combination of multiple massive strokes and sepsis) and as it was going on,  ""at least it isn't covid"" was said by at least one person while he was in the hospital."
24881,Covid would have had a *much*better prognosis.
24882,Probably way higher than that.
24883,Expect worse for XMAS and NYE.
24884,Most Americans aren't willing to follow these restrictions for 8+ months and will accept the cases/deaths that come with it.
24885,Unless they’re donating it I guess
24886,Totally agreed!

25115,mRNA has limited capacities to be written from.
25116,The cell doesn't need to die to stop synthesis and will far outlive that event.
25117,mRNA is a short use recipe and there are a lot of single use recipes during cell's lifetime.

25210,"I thought it would just be a bad flu for me, as it's been for most people my age."
25211,"Nope, got no luck."
25212,"And then talked to other people who had it and I realize it's worst than most people think, as we are a quite high percentage to have long term problems."

25218,Didn't think it would affect me that much.
25219,Keep in mind that even if they manage to vaccinate people in 2020 -which almost certainly will not be 5% of the population- they aren't protected right away.
25220,Depending on the vaccine used they need a second shot after 3 or 4 weeks.

- on that basis, impose unprecedented restrictions on who can work, how many friends you can have dinner with, and how many people one is allowed to have over to their home for a holiday

- and repeatedly state that failure to follow those restrictions will directly lead to deaths?"

25428,"Ok, so on the animal to human interaction, I’ll add some other issues."
25429,"Yes, the interaction between animals and humans in dirty environments is bad."
25430,We know this and many documentaries show it clearly in markets in un(der)developed parts of the world.

25433,"Let’s also look @ the increasing population, which is fed in a large part in most places by farmed animal protein."

25469,A mask is removable and doesn't harm the person wearing it but it can save the lives of thousands.

25484,Experts in the UK seem pretty calm headed and understand that Oxford have been working with the MHRA for months and know how to run clinical trials.
25485,Nobody has seen the full data yet and it is clear that the vaccine prevents people getting ill which is great news as that's the primary goal of these vaccines.
25486,4 million doses are literally ready to go in the UK for a vaccine that stops people dying
25487,"Oh, I haven't grown or become thankful."
25488,I feel like I'm at that point where you are in a bad relationship and have to get out because the other person is irredeemably toxic.
25489,And you're sad because you know you can never feel the same way about that person again.
25490,Except here the boyfriend is basically the world.
25491,It is like growing up with parents who always let you down and learning never to trust anything.
25492,"And here I can't even trust that when I work hard, etc, I will have the payoff of being able to do enjoyable things with my earnings, so I'm no longer sure what the point is."

25494,"I just want to work enough to have a place to live, be able to go out and have a nice dinner and a couple of cocktails, go to the movies, and find a gym I enjoy."
25495,And my resentment of the government has never been greater.
25496,15 acres in the middle of the woods and being a complete hermit has never been more appealing.

25499,"Thankfully I've got a wine and spirits right across from where I work, and I'm definitely picking up a bottle as soon as I get out of work!"
25500,Definitely.
25501,October is probably the absolute earliest I'd go out without a mask.

25543,I've had similar worries from my workplace.
25544,I understand your frustration.
25545,Peoples' ignorance is really blowing me away too.
25546,This is the difference in public vs private systems.
25547,* Public system: we serve the public good.
25548,We have a duty to help people.
25549,* Private system: regardless of our personal feelings regarding helping people we serve our corporate overlords full stop.

25684,Yes.
25685,I know but considering that minorities are the biggest victims of COVID it’s just a weird joke.
25686,I must admit I don't understand this sentiment.
25687,"A vaccine has been distributed to most of the population and has led to a significant drop in hospitalizations and deaths, yet because the disease can still spread asymptomatically, you must close your business/lose your job/avoid travel/stop seeing people indoors."

25812,Everyone I have personally talked to will not get the first round.
25813,We do not want this rushed vaccine... also Modernas is being hailed as the cure but the side effects are bad.
25814,There will be a big rebellion if we are forced to get this like the flu vaccine.
25815,"I am not an experiment, I am not a pawn in this pandemic, I am not a martyr, I am being used and abused along with my fellow nurses and hospital staff."

25818,I am against a rushed vaccine being forced upon medical staff.
25819,Despite lack of PPE and ever changing rules based on lack of PPE I have been safe thus far and will continue to take proper precautions.
25820,Now it’s be nice if the covid deniers could wake up and maskless people mask up... that would help more.
25821,"But even in the medical community, most of my coworkers disregard social distancing and mask wearing guidelines so it’s going to be a long butt quarantine with a lot of deaths..."

25823,There is some discussion of vaccinations starting with healthcare workers and the very elderly starting in late December ... maybe.
25824,"It would be more accurate to compare Sweden to their neighboring countries as these countries have a similar culture and society, where social distancing and non-generational households is the norm."

25831,"We gotta remember that Canada is signed on to so many producers that if J&amp;J and Novavax also work we’ll have orders for 5 functioning vaccines, so even if we don’t get the December doses of Pfizer/Moderna we have a lot of other vaccines that will rapidly increase our supply in Q2 2021."
25832,Also we’re still getting 6M doses of Moderna and Pfizer starting January anyways.
25833,"The news is really playing both sides of the coin, by reporting on the doses we’ll get in January then also making a vague report that “other countries will get it first!!!!!!”."
25834,"Like yeah no shit, did we expect the US to not use initial doses first before starting to supply us?"

25848,Immunity can't be *at least* x months because that's an absolute term.
25849,It has to be an average.
25850,you should never tell people that you're essentially guaranteeing them a minimum amount of immunity.
25851,You should always tell them it's an average.
25852,It's not that hard of a rule to follow and I'm definitely right.
25853,"It doesn't matter if they don't know the exact average amounts of months, it's still an average."

25855,"**

It's not hard, just stop saying the words at least and say the word on average and All of a sudden the statement won't be misleading and inaccurate."
25856,You're literally misinforming people when you say something like the immunity will be at least 6 months.
25857,"Especially right now, for a lot of people the vaccines going to be out before we figure out what the average length of immunity even was!"
25858,"Also in case you don't understand, when the average immunity is 12 months you still have an ex percent to lose immunity per month."
25859,"Even if the average immunity is 12 months, some people lose immunity in the first month, some people lose immunity in the second month, even more people lose a minute in the third month and so on and so forth until you achieve the average immunity of 12 months out of the given population which would also include some people who go beyond 12 months of immunity."

26325,"Just because it's over there, it takes just one airline flight to bring it here."
26326,"It says in the article that Baylor, one of the few named places that plan to make it mandatory, already makes the flu vaccine mandatory."
26327,All valid points I’m well aware of.
26328,And also consider.
26329,"So while I’m well education and studied about criminal activity of big pharma, you haven’t done your homework on the items suggested."
26330,You need research vaccine compounds and science behind vaccine makeup.
26331,This will help you know which ones will be of concern to you for long term health vs safe base on our 200 year scientific knowledge on how these compounds work on the body.
26332,Don’t spit your bullshit to me when you haven’t done your homework.
26333,"totally agree, we won't see peak COVID deaths for 6 weeks or so, having a 5000 dead a day is not an impossibility in the US as healthcare systems go under"
26334,You just stated in your previous comment that was a difference in the holiday period but you are backtracking now.
26335,and I'm just expanding on the comment where you talked about people coming back from Pakistan etc.
26336,The least likely outcome for those under 50 is the least likely outcome.
26337,I'm sure reasonable aren't afraid of such nonsense.
26338,"A lot of the effective vaccines like that confer lasting immunity, only needing a booster shot in like 10 years or so."
26339,The immune system doesn't confer lasting immunity to coronaviruses.
26340,The only way to get this under control is to vaccinate everyone over the next year and have them come back 6 months later for a booster.
26341,"That will be enough to get the R0 below 1 to finally have to epidemic die out (there will still probably be endemic outbreaks here and there but with enough vaccine conferred herd immunity, it will be locally contained)."
26342,I don't think the EU has the power to enforce anything like that.
26343,Poland is an independent nation and can set whatever covid policy they want.

Vaccine effectiveness
Vaccine effectiveness describes how well the vaccine offers protection against the target disease in the real world, rather than in a controlled clinical trial."
26345,"Vaccine trials usually include healthy volunteers, but often don’t tell us how well the vaccine works in children, elderly people, or those with compromised immune systems."
26346,"Reported vaccine efficacies of 90-95%, as we’ve heard recently, may sound impressive."
26347,"However, under real-world conditions, the vaccines are likely to offer much less protection in some population groups."
26348,"It is kind of weird how 8 months ago we laughed at people who talked about forced vaccinations and New World Orders, and now here everybody has to get their vaccine so they can participate in the Great Reset."
26349,major wave already happening.
26350,"Then next month (thanksgiving, christmas)  is going to be a sharknado tsunami on top of the current tidal wave."
26351,Good luck to that sheriff enforcing that fine.
26352,Nothing but talk that can't be enforced.
26353,"Yeah, I’m with you there, I guess I just don’t see how protecting those people is less important than the economy, which seems to be the ultimate point of “the other side.” They seem willing to sacrifice hundreds of thousands of people just to keep things “normal.” Maybe I should stop trying to make sense of nonsensical takes."
26354,"Aa of right now, as long as they're quarantining beforehand and wear masks responsibly while in public, the northeast is doing well enough that I would say 5 people visiting isn't that big of a deal imo."
26355,"I mean I get your point, it is surprising they're not being hyper careful."
26356,But the northeast is doing well (at least compared to the shit show out in the mid west).
26357,"Plus it's 5 people, not those massive 20 people or more gatherings, which are the real issue."
26358,"now consider if 10% progress to a serious level of COVID, we do not have a spare 200,000 covid rated beds at the moment available in total"

26368,"That being said, that’s obviously NOT an excuse to see people in person instead."
26369,But for some people it’s not anything close to a replacement.
26370,I am not going to take any of the vaccines done so far.
26371,Pfizer and moderna have a new technology and oxford is very suspect.
26372,Waiting for Johnson and Johnson

26374,I’m extremely surprised at the GOP base for thinking their leadership had Been doing fine.
26375,"Yeah, I meant better off until the catch-up."
26376,The way I understood the swedish thinking is that they figured the disease would burn through the population anyways and any hard lock-downs would just delay the inevitable.
26377,So they just wanted to slow it enough for the health care system to be able to cope.

26400,Like anyone from the EU would want to come to the US right now.
26401,You'd think the white house would have other things to worry about.
26402,Rural hospitals have the worst working conditions due to political based COVID denial.
26403,Nurses leave rural hospitals to work in cities for 7k a week.
26404,"Rural hospitals become overloaded, can't afford nurses at 7k a week."

26409,I 100% get why people are not willing to go a year or more without seeing anyone in person.
26410,What I don't understand why people can't just see each other *outdoors*.
26411,"While it is not risk free, there simply aren't examples of 12 out of 12 people at an outdoor party getting sick."
26412,It's *much* lower risk.
26413,"In fact, studies have shown that being outdoors [reduces transmission by 95%](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/03/well/live/coronavirus-spread-outdoors-party.html)."
26414,"(That makes an unmasked outdoor gathering many times safer than an indoor, masked gathering, for those keeping score)."
26415,"And before you comment on the weather, I've seen my friends and family outdoors in weather ranging from 15 degrees F to 95 degrees F without anyone going inside."
26416,It is completely doable.
26417,"I will add, on a final note, that in my state social gatherings of more than one household are currently banned, even outside, and I am complying with that ban."
26418,"I think everyone should comply with the laws of their state, *at a minimum*."
26419,"That being said, this isn't so bad for me, because I saw people (outside only) this summer and fall."
26420,"Personally I think the Vaccine needs to tested longer, the half dose was barely tested at all, so how do we know if it wasnt just a fluke?"
26421,Pardon?
26422,Second hand smoke causes cancer among many other things.
26423,"&gt;Lol, what a reach."
26424,Precisely what I also thought.
26425,Tegnell saying that they are allowing some spread is not proof of a herd immunity strategy
26426,"I mean for immigration, you already need medical cerfitication for vaccination."
26427,"It's because being a selfish, sociopathic prick is a learned trait."
26428,"Did Imperial Japan commit genocide on the same level as nazi Germany, yes or no"
26429,"I'm concerned this model is wrong, they seem to be using in R0 of around 2 but when social distancing isn't observed SARS-cov-2 has an R0 closer to 6, so that means rather than having 20 million cases by December we could be looking at a number closer to 74 million."
26430,CFR will also rise as hospitals are overwhelmed and patients with severe cases lose access to life saving interventions such as supplemental oxygen and ventilation.
26431,Someone please tell me I'm wrong.
26432,"It's a bit uncanny that their strategy, for a coronavirus, where typically immunity only lasts \~6 months, was to let it spread."
26433,It'll take longer than 6 months to spread to everyone and therefore it will just keep infecting people.
26434,The only sound strategy is social distancing and safe vaccination rollout.
26435,"Well, hopefully it takes them out of the gene pool vs people who didn't celebrate in massive groups that then have to go work with them."
26436,Yes I'm sure people will self quarantine on arrival /s

26440,Getting some cheap tickets and ten people to help is not exactly difficult if you are a determined terrorist group.
26441,"""What about Nazi Germany?"""
26442,But the answer to your question is no.
26443,We also should not have bombed civilians in Germany.
26444,That’s fair I never trust the government.
26445,"However, by the language of people saying we need total lockdowns etc."
26446,Florida has rebuked that for months.
26447,By their claims we should be in a 10x worse state than any other place in the country with hospitals overfilled and people dieing left and right to the point you couldn’t hide it but we’re just not seeing that.
26448,Unionize
26449,"I think most of the famous people who have had Covid havent had long-term complications though, have they?"
26450,Fair enough.
26451,Pretty sure they would just be great mongering articles.
26452,That is because only cats can teleport.
26453,"Yes, children are small but they lack the appropriate fur-to-skin ratio and tail required to be successful."
26454,Also their vocalizations are less nuanced than felines.
26455,"&amp;#x200B;

   Please do not teleport your children!"
26456,"I follow my governor on another social media outlet and he has posted the possible long term effects of COVID, several times actually but most of the responses are people who don't believe him."
26457,"It's a shame that even when someone has valuable information right in front of them, it's not believed."
26458,Smh.
26459,"Don’t forget to mention that the government is a bunch of sociopathic morons, which are trying to destroy the democracy to gain unlimited control over the country."
26460,Is there a correlation to party lines?
26461,Cigarette smoking is not the same as exposing others to a life threatening virus during a pandemic.
26462,"So, assume we're likely to see the same issues in kids globally."
26463,Denmark and Sweden don't really have different holiday periods or travel culture.
26464,I think that's pretty clear.
26465,&gt;Sweden didn't ship off those immigrants to an island used for nuclear testing and isolate them or anything.
26466,"I'm sorry, but you honestly seem to be on some kind of ideological crusade now."
26467,"There are about 5,000,000 with the disease."
26468,The mortality rate is 3%.
26469,It's going to get real ugly.

26471,thats what we do with people who are intentionally a danger to society.
26472,This is why these polls are worthless.

26479,"Should we have compromised for peace with Nazi Germany, yes or no."
26480,I have but lately I’ve just needed to hear it again.
26481,Thanks
26482,That's not what a deadman switch means.
26483,I understand your point...
26484,"I think you mean  something more like the military tactic of ""scorched earth"" during a retrograde."
26485,Reddit needs more of you.
26486,I don't think there's any doubt that the surrender saved lives.
26487,It's less obvious that the bombings were hugely effective in precipitating it; [Stephen Kotkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Kotkin) points out in some of his talks that the Japanese surrender seems to have been precipitated by the Russian declaration of War rather than anything else.
26488,&gt;Peet Tull says herd immunity.
26489,Not Tegnell.
26490,"Heh...

Tegnell literally confirms that ***""Allow the spread of infection, slowly or rapidly, to achieve a hypothetical 'herd immunity'."
26491,"""*** is the chosen strategy."
26492,"You have three options, choose one:

- Option 1
- Option 2
- Option 3

You choose ""Option 3"", but it doesn't count because you didn't *write* ""Option 3"" ?"
26493,"Lol, what a reach."
26494,"In the linked article it says ..

26498,They won't.
26499,My job required flu shots this year and it was expected we pay for it and go on our own time.
26500,Funny thing is they only offer insurance to full timers and most of the staff is part time.

26505,"If people in health care here want to stop being shat upon, the only way to achieve that is with direct action."
26506,For sure.
26507,I already told my friends in Discord that I don't think 250k-300k cases per day is unreasonable for the second or third week of December.
26508,Most everyone I know is doing Thanksgiving.
26509,"Only a few of them have even trimmed down the numbers this year, but most are still doing at least 6-10 people."
26510,My wife and I are luckily in a position to be able to sway our families so both of ours are postponing until next year.
26511,How many people in nursing homes?
26512,"You realize that most Americans don't understand how vaccines work and as soon as the news hits that the vaccine dropped, they'll think everyone is immune."

26515,There's a difference between not sharing confidential information and lying though.
26516,"And as a wife, if I ask my husband if a dress makes me look fat, I do so expecting his honest opinion."
26517,There would be not point in asking otherwise.
26518,"I agree that ""never"" was too strong of a word though."
26519,But lying erodes trust.
26520,The PPE lie wasn't worth it or justified.
26521,"Wow, good job, your whataboutism brought a Colorado worth of Chinese civilians back to life!"
26522,There is a natural reservoir for plague and it doesn't transmit between humans.

26566,"Yeah, like I'm literally slightly allergic to cats and live with 2 (I didn't know I was until I was tested)."
26567,I get a shot every week to gradually build immunity that usually flares up my allergies for the next 36 hours.
26568,I have to wear a mask and go in person because I can't administer myself yet (they make you go a certain amount of times) and the alternatives were way too expensive.
26569,I'm also allergic to lots of grasses here (including wiregrass) and Florida is both high humidity and high pollon.
26570,Most of the time I'm only breathing well through one nostril and often ONLY one nostril.
26571,Do you or do you not agree that there's a subconscious stigma that comes with wearing masks?
26572,"IMO they're dehumanizing, and human evolution/psychology would agree with that."

26695,"(Simply recommending masks, Spiegel notes, “doesn’t do anything.”) In fact, instituting a mask mandate reduces a county’s future fatality growth rate by 12%—about the same, in isolation, as more disruptive measures including stay-at-home orders and closing restaurants."

26921,"This is our first Thanksgiving where we haven't traveled or hosted family - same for Christmas, when it comes."
26922,"I *know* this is the right thing to do this year, and I know that it'll just make next year's celebrations that much better."
26923,"But damn it, I'm really sad right now."
26924,"I acknowledge my luck and good fortune in still having my friends and family healthy (plus having a wonderful husband and cats to celebrate with at home), but it just really sucks not seeing them this year."
26925,"If you're feeling that way too, just know that you're not alone."
26926,"We are doing the right thing, but doing the right thing can feel really sucky sometimes."
26927,"Come on, vaccines..."
26928,"Even getting a cold or the flu sends me five steps back in regards to my symptoms, so I feel you on that."
26929,"Mine swings back and forth between managed and unmanaged, and getting covid during the severe period of that cycle would be devastating to the progress I’ve made."
26930,"This was reported for misinfo, which I don't think is exactly correct, but your sourcing is a bit weird here."

26932,"You can't make a claim like ""COVID19 is far more dangerous than the flu"" based on two studies, one of which only covers cardiovascular complications."
26933,Most claims of post viral illness don't involve the cardiovascular system.
26934,Legal in Oregon
26935,Sounds like a good piece for your local news team.
26936,If they do die it won’t be because of a virus slightly more harmful than the flu it will because terrified sheep beg governments to dispose and destroy those who oppose.
26937,"I would argue that the longer it takes no matter how well it’s managed, the number of people not using preventative medicine will increase."
26938,So that would actually feed into my point.
26939,I thought they were like permenantly locked down?
26940,I bet everyone is partying instead.
26941,I think it’s better to just stay out at home in general.
26942,Not worth getting the rona to sightsee.
26943,All this so people can keep barely subsistence levels of income at jobs where they are regarded only as a profit making unit.
26944,This pandemic has laid bare the exploitation of our current economic system.
26945,The whole thing is built upon exploitation for profit.

26950,There is always a dude like this.
26951,"""How can people starve with bread 99c a loaf""."
26952,"Yeah dude, we can live just on bread."
26953,"About your 10 dollar shopping list, did your kitchen equipment (pots, you know), condiments, etc grow in trees or you just forgot to include them in your calculation?"
26954,"Its such a hard situation to judge, with a lot of these polls i'd have a hard time answering accurately myself."
26955,"Normally, my extended family all gathers for Thanksgiving (25+ people from ~7+ households) - luckily everyone agreed that is definitely a bad idea."
26956,"However, now my wife has planned for us to head to her parents."
26957,"It would just be me, her and her parents, so obviously 100x better than the big gathering, but her mom is high risk, and I am trying my damndest right now to convince my wife that even a 2-household gathering with 4 of us is not worth the risk."
26958,"Everyone is on edge and to be fair, both households HAVE been very careful."
26959,But I know deep down that's not enough to justify hanging out with them for a few days indoors.
26960,"When I bring it up my wife will say ""fine then don't go, but I'm going."""
26961,"Which is not an actual solution in any way since if I have it she most definitely does too, and if God forbid her parents had it my wife would just bring it back to me the next day."
26962,People need to stop making justifications for themselves and just stay the fuck home.
26963,Ugh.
26964,"But if I can't even convince my wife, how can I expect that anyone else will listen?"
26965,In what way?
26966,We won't really see Thanksgiving for a month.
26967,On it.
26968,Thanks.
26969,I went early last year.
26970,It’s easily my favorite country I’ve traveled to!
26971,"Technically it would be sedition, since as far as we know no foreign actors were involved; just domestic corporations."
26972,No.
26973,I'm saying that they might lock down again.
26974,Because she’s not her parents
26975,"yet on his official FB page, people seem to love him,  it's unreal  
so many comments like this ""Thank you, Governor DeSantis."
26976,"Happy Thanksgiving to your family."""
26977,"""Thank you for all you do!"
26978,"So happy to be living here in sunny Florida"""
26979,Except this is your typical outsider looking in issue.
26980,"Japanese bureaucracies do tend to be very slow in approving anything, but once change has been decided on they move extremely quickly."
26981,"A more accurate way of describing Japan is that it is a ""look before you leap"" society."
26982,"That's why plans tend to be very detailed and beyond the general public's comprehension, but nonetheless executed very well once decided on."
26983,That's indeed why there was this initial gulf between the perception of the government response (slow and ineffective) when in reality this was because everyone was focused on the national picture where it's difficult to formulate a plan that can work for everyone.
26984,By contrast at the local level pretty decisive and effective contact tracing was implemented that largely stopped the initial outbreaks.
26985,Guessing European.
26986,This has been the experience of my great-grandmother as well (Russian).
26987,These are tough times
26988,"It is very interesting because most of us understand exponential growth, basic math (3/12=4), average cases a day, etc."
26989,It was a mind-boggling for me to really put it into perspective that we have recorded 25% (will be higher) in the month of November.
26990,It didn't really click for me until I saw the statistic.
26991,I suppose?
26992,Depends on how you frame it semantically.
26993,Or you could say that their early action allowed them to shrug-off the first hit without feeling much effect.
26994,Facts...
26995,"Oh, hey Kiwi."
26996,"If people who get vaccinated don't wear masks, there will be people who just lie and say they got vaccinated to avoid wearing a mask."
26997,We should all just continue wearing them until the vaccine is rolled out to most of the population.
26998,Kebabs are important.
26999,I'd divorce my wife if she had parents like that.
27000,Actually how could you marry someone that was raised by people like that?
27001,"In my 20s, I was a nanny."
27002,Nannies don't have insurance but it was okay bc my husband did.
27003,*Until* we decided to go our separate ways but I didn't have time to pick a new career path so I stayed.
27004,The family I nannied for had real wood floors and insisted on no shoes in the house.
27005,"One day, I got a HUGE splinter of their floor in my foot THRU my sock!"
27006,"Long story short, 7 weeks later I had to have surgery to remove what was still stuck in the ball of my foot."
27007,"Without my husband's insurance, it would have cost me over $14,000."
27008,"Thankfully, we stayed legally married so that I could keep my insurance then ended up back together."
27009,Happier than ever 8 years later and thankful I'm not still paying off a splinter.
27010,Not everyone is so lucky.
27011,Muh 2 more weeks
27012,I completely agree with you.
27013,The only requirement is to up ( preferably on time  ).
27014,"In the US military we have a saying, suit up and show up and hopefully the brain will follow..."
27015,&gt;You really don't understand how vaccines work.
27016,They only truly protect you if enough people around you also took it.
27017,"So this statement is not correct, no?"
27018,"90 - 95% of the time a vaccine *will* protect you, regardless of what the people around you do, correct?"
27019,Ray Tracing in Night City.
27020,"I saw an IG post from a nurse working in an ER in a Philly suburb that was basically ""this is media hype and mostly overblown""


This was a few weeks ago."
27021,I think she's about to get a harsh lesson in how well the mitigation strategies in her community worked up until that point and I'll be curious to see what she's posting after Thanksgiving.
27022,EDIT: lmao I just checked and her account is private now
27023,"Lol, dumbest comment I’ve read today *so far*.😎"
27024,It turned out it was social distancing that did this.
27025,The mistake early on was thinking the number of infected was much larger and that the measures were ineffective so immunity would be the only thing that could stop the spread.
27026,"As a decent human being from S. Korea hearing about people dying all over the planet, it breaks my heart."
27027,"Btw, my mother has heart disease and in a risk group."
27028,Thanks for the article
27029,Yikes...
27030,Australia’s lockdown didn’t work?
27031,NZ’s didn’t either?
27032,Neither did Vietnam’s?
27033,"Whoa, you better share this news with the world!"
27034,"At 95% effectiveness, you only really need to hit 70% vaccinated and the virus finds no quarter and will die out in a few short generations since the r value will be under 1"
27035,An enemy of the people.
27036,But I dont know for sure if thats true.
27037,I see article after article from everyone but the FDA stating information about when the vaccine will be available.
27038,Even the FDA website says they've been preparing for months to review the submissions made by these companies for Emergency Use.
27039,That's not the same as they've been reviewing the data compiled by these companies for months.
27040,"The truth is that while it can be only mere hours after FDA approval when the first of these vaccines roll out, the approval may take weeks or months."
27041,"We just don't know when it will happen and its dangerous for people like the CDC and Doctors to give a false sense of security that its going to be here in a few weeks, when it very well may take longer than that."
27042,"Yeah, absolutely indistinguishable from their humor."
27043,Telehealth in the US but my kids see their doctor still.
27044,"Vaccines have been successful for more than a century and the ""antivax"" movement started around the 2000s, so no."
27045,No hope.
27046,So they're only in the top 10%?
27047,Well done...
27048,I guess...

27051,Thank you for your cooperation.
27052,I think many of them don't care enough to do anything about it and this would have been a good opportunity to change that.
27053,"But, we passed on it for whatever reason."
27054,Zoomsgiving it is.
27055,"People get fairly sick with some other virus and call it a ""flu."""

27059,"Happy Thanksgiving to you, and your family!"""
27060,"""  BEST GOVERNOR EVER!"
27061,"Thank you for not shutting down""  ""Good job Governor!"
27062,"We the people like our state not locked down!"""
27063,"I'm not cherry picking these comments,  every comment on his FB page is like this"
27064,And that’s why no one in this sub understands why people are gathering.
27065,The vast majority of people only feel life is worth living if they can see others in person.
27066,"It's time to do all of those things, but with the added financial and psychological strain of the last few months."
27067,Oh and it's also holiday season.
27068,This does not bode well.
27069,I wondered this as well.
27070,I would have thought the CDC would have be ready to start the meeting the HOUR that the application for approval was sent in.
27071,I think I did year something about them waiting for some additional data on the patients that had the vaccine and still got Covid.
27072,But to me the number of dead and dying would be more important than that.
27073,They've tested it on a LOT of people.
27074,I wish they had made this the MOST URGENT thing in all of their lives.
27075,I know there is probably more complexity to it than I'm aware of.
27076,I just wish they would let us know why they're taking so long to have this meeting.
27077,Can anyone out there explain?
27078,15 people getting sick means the gathering was probably quite a bit more than 15
27079,So is no one in this sub going to be with family thanksgiving?
27080,"&gt;Given your previous comments it looks like you're arguing against yourself, lol."
27081,I dont think so.
27082,Someone said vaccinations dont protect you unless everybody gets them.
27083,Do you agree with that statement?
27084,"I'm thinking you might want to talk to to someone - this sounds more about depression than hating your job, especially since you would never consider getting a different job."
27085,"&gt;From Alaska’s extensive data collection we know that 19% of their infected Pacific Islanders and Hawai‘ians end up in the hospital

27086,Yeah construction workers by and large don’t give a shit.

27095,"My point is it’s excessively careful, like they weren’t."
27096,Working outside the home is a risk.
27097,I would not do so and then visit my family.

27104,I would straight up tell my family no thanks I am not coming.
27105,It makes no sense given the current climate.

27122,I can’t tell if you’re simply describing your own situation or advocating for others to gather tomorrow.
27123,I’ve yet to see a single article heralding Kaua‘i’s incredibly unique virtually covid free status.
27124,Instead the most motivated on the mainland remain unaware of us as they ponder how to move to New Zealand.
27125,"You have evidence from Alaska, Tahiti, the Bahamas, and other destinations that make it clear a single preflight test will let too much covid through and eventually result in community spread."
27126,From Alaska’s extensive data collection we know that 19% of their infected Pacific Islanders and Hawai‘ians end up in the hospital – more than twice any other group.
27127,"We also know that at least 3 out of 1,000 travelers are infected and missed with a single preflight test."
27128,I suspect a close reading of the data will soon show it to be even higher.
27129,"My hygienist was going on about how it's overblown and I was like cool, I feel so safe right now."
27130,That's why I mentioned sterilizing vs. non-sterilizing immunity.

27132,"Cringe at the ""cancel"" thing."
27133,"&gt;The strategy — aimed at allowing some exposure to the virus **in order to build immunity** among the general population while protecting high-risk groups like the elderly

They made up this part."
27134,I'd take that part as seriously as I would you saying Sweden has a herd immunity strategy.
27135,I think of it more in terms of math.
27136,Giving someone who already has covid a vaccine isn’t going to save their life.
27137,That ship has sailed.
27138,You need ~70% of the population to get a vaccine (or Covid and have long term immunity) to reach herd immunity.
27139,I say roughly 70% because that number is throw around a lot but obviously spread will correlate negatively with the % vaccinated so you’ll see a benefit before we reach 70%.
27140,"So it makes sense to distribute based on population because you need 70% of the population in every state to get the vaccine (or covid, again)."
27141,"Theoretically, if spread is bad in one area like SD you could send them even less vaccines proportionally to get them to 70% with antibodies/B cells/T cells."
27142,At least in the short term until natural Covid-caught immunity wears off.
27143,Or someone was asymptomatic.
27144,Covid could be picked up quite literally everywhere - a lot of people aren't understanding that.
27145,Perhaps they just pumped their gas before going to this - didn't sanitize or wash their hands after and SURPRISE: Covid!
27146,I think we should have more trust in each other in regards to services we provide each other on a human to human level without the need for an authorative figure to tell us what is right and wrong.
27147,"You would prefer to have and pay someone to tell you right from wrong, rather than trust in good people."
27148,This statement has nothing to do with masks or coronavirus.
27149,Just your lack of character and humility.
27150,Isn't that the level of community spread we're seeing in worst-case scenario communities like all of South Dakota?
27151,"And admittedly, this is with them living life ""as normal""."
27152,But what are they comparing with?
27153,"Massachusetts, New York have much higher deaths rates."
27154,"I'm confused about what you mean, as Link #2 is by Puntmann, et al."
27155,"The two sources in link #1 are below, and are unrelated to Puntmann's study:

[https://science.sciencemag.org/content/370/6515/408](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/370/6515/408)

They did come to similar conclusions though so I can see why it's confusing."
27156,Link #3 mentions how cardio involvement in the flu has a prevalence of 0-10%.
27157,IFR is higher with Covid19.
27158,Cardio involvement is far higher with Covid19.
27159,Long-term respiratory symptoms is higher with Covid19 so I do wonder how saying it's far more dangerous is not qualified at this point?
27160,"It shows that Covid-19 is causing inflammation in systems outside of the respiratory system which would explain the strokes, increased MIs, etc."
27161,"Even if it doesn't manifest as a MI, it shows that there are detectable changes in the heart post-covid in the majority of patients."
27162,It wouldn't be stretch to think that can affect the brain since inflammation of the brain is one of the proposed mechanisms for memory issues after the flu.
27163,"But yes, symptoms often involve the respiratory systems post-Covid, which is also fairly common."

27165,"That ""guy"" is the Infection Control Doctor of one of the regions."
27166,Swedes tell us that it is the regions that actually have responsibility for putting in place measures related to public health and that the FHM only acts as a sort of adviser.
27167,"Besides, what makes you think this *infection control doctor* decided what the strategy was, rather than simply informing people what he was advised by the FHM?"
27168,"Good point, I’ll try that and get back to you with the results"

27178,"Not an anti-vaxxer by any means, I just want the peace of mind of a large sample size with long term effects played out."
27179,My mom works research testing in a major pharmaceutical company.
27180,Ive seen soo many drugs be killed at her stage because of long-term side effects that popped up.
27181,So ill give it time.
27182,With that said once widely available there needs to be re-integration rules like this made standard.
27183,Un-vaccinated people need to continue to practice quarantining and social distancing indefinitely.
27184,Absolutely nothing wrong with that.

27187,Many societies mask up for other respiratory viruses during flu season.
27188,"It hasn't been culturally accepted in the US but I, for one, hope the practice continues at least among individuals showing symptoms."
27189,"Secondly, Measles is not a great comparison."
27190,"Truly one of the most contagious viruses out there, can have an insane reproductive number up to 60."
27191,"Like with SARS-CoV-2's relatively low IFR there are still myriad long-term symptoms following Measles infection, especially among children most vulnerable to the virus."
27192,Except for the holidays we're going into.
27193,Please state where the vaccine process was expedited in a way that could compromise its results?
27194,Also please point out the side effects that are significant enough to cause alarm (specifically long lasting irreversible side effects)?
27195,"If you can do that, you have some legitimacy, otherwise, this is just a long winded rant."

27205,"Fortunately, my symptoms have been pretty mild."
27206,"I have 4 more days of quarantine, but I won’t be going anywhere until I’m completely symptom free."

27220,&gt;	How was it communicated from the Swedish Public Health Agency?
27221,&gt;- What I remember now was that it was discussed in the media.
27222,Several actors.
27223,I think I first saw it in an article with former state epidemiologist Annika Linde.
27224,Then there were many who talked about it and there were curves and graphs everywhere.
27225,Statistics-Britton was often in the call.
27226,But I do not remember if I saw it in any Public Health Authority document.
27227,"He was apparently confused, which is worrying in itself."
27228,"https://www.expressen.se/nyheter/qs/interna-radslaget-om-flockimmunitet/

Edit: formatting"
27229,What exactly is wrong with that article?
27230,"*“In major parts of Sweden, around Stockholm, we have reached a plateau (in new cases) and we’re already seeing the effect of herd immunity and in a few weeks’ time we’ll see even more of the effects of that."
27231,"And in the rest of the country, the situation is stable,” Dr. Anders Tegnell, chief epidemiologist at Sweden’s Public Health Agency, told CNBC on Tuesday."
27232,"*

Do you think they've fabricated this quote?"
27233,Sweden chose a strategy where the goal is herd immunity through infection.
27234,"A Herd immunity strategy, if you may."
27235,"maybe some lies are ok, but not your analogy in this case, and certainly not from a top infectious disease expert (if he actually knowingly lied)"
27236,"&gt; Your source also state that they are trying to decrease infection to as low as possible,

You need to understand something."
27237,They say it != they do it.
27238,"It depends on the position, I suppose."
27239,"For example, my last job required a lot of travel so I negotiated things that made travel easier: individual business credit card, ability to book any hotel or flights I wanted (within reason, of course, no first class everywhere)."
27240,"I also guaranteed my own office, flexibility with working hours, payment of my moving expenses."
27241,"This position was also for a fairly rural operation so I negotiated a deal where if they let me go for whatever reason (except theft or criminal activity, of course) I would get six months severance to give me time to find a new job and move my family again, with the caveat that as soon as I found a position the severance would end."
27242,Just stuff like that.
27243,I could get away with a lot because the requirements for this position were very specific and there were not many suitable applicants.
27244,The position before that I basically had to take what they gave me because I wasn't in a great negotiating position.
27245,Yeah a very low chance.
27246,Extremely low.
27247,I Measure risk and commonsense terms.
27248,You’re acting like you have to do that Amount of stuff to stay safe with this
27249,"I’m in central Ca, no lockdown."
27250,We have a “curfew” but our sheriff already said he wouldn’t do anything about the curfew or mask mandates.
27251,We’re doomed.
27252,"There actually was one called LYMErix, but it was pulled from the market out of mostly unfounded safety fears (it came out shortly after the infamous wakefeild study)."
27253,Well let's just take in several hundreds thousands of skill workers to push down the wages and raise the house prices.
27254,"Little world, little mind."
27255,Maybe in the US.
27256,"But where I'm from it's voluntary, cause they haven't been rejected until now basically."
27257,"But I guess that's going to change, wich, might be a good thing."
27258,Most of the testing in my area is drive thru.
27259,You don’t have contact with the other people waiting to test.
27260,Yep.
27261,"That's just like people who claim they can't lose weight despite eating just 800 calories a day, and when you actually observe them, they put ranch on everything and chug soda all day long."
27262,"It's cognitive dissonance, plain and simple."
27263,This post is absolutely peak reddit.
27264,"How exactly does this mean ""Pack Black Friday doorbusters!""?"
27265,Your projection as you spread misinformation yourself is ironic though.
27266,"&gt; Our small businesses have not only supported their communities while keeping their employees, customers, and our brave frontline workers safe, but they have made us all proud to call Michigan our home."
27267,We all must continue doing our part to help our small businesses not only survive this ongoing pandemic but thrive long after it has ended.
27268,I urge all Michiganders to be smart and stay safe as we head into the holiday season.

27270,The flu causes an 8 times higher risk to children than Covid.
27271,"It’s Justizverwaltung opposite for the elderly 
That is already a well established fact."
27272,So what about children with the flu in Poland ?
27273,But cant vaccinated people still carry the virus and give it to other people?
27274,"Well, that's disappointing."
27275,I guess this is why I use a full face respirator with p100 filters.
27276,I've been around people that would test positive for the virus.
27277,It appears the respirator is doing it's job as I'm not sick.
27278,When the world becomes a BSL-3 lab why mess around with inferior PPE?
27279,And it was a dumb point?
27280,Washing lettuce is probably low enough on the pareto chart of infection risks if you have to work outside the home.
27281,lol how exactly are Australia and NZ isolated?
27282,"The UK is an isolated island too, right?"
27283,So how did they fuck up so badly?
27284,"Also restrictions are set to be lifted next week in Australia, and people there don’t even have to wear masks since they contained the virus."
27285,"What other restrictions are you talking about, specifically?"

27305,You would divorce your spouse if she had a different opinion on Covid than you?!
27306,For fuck sakes.
27307,"&gt;You're really going pretty far out of your way to pretend to not understand what you're arguing against

What the heck?"
27308,"Someone said ""What about my right to not get infected by someone""

And I said ""Thats why *you* get the vaccination""."
27309,"It's to protect you, right?"
27310,"And then someone said ""You dont understand how vaccinations work."
27311,"They only truly protect you if enough people around you also took it."""
27312,"But that is just wrong, isnt it?"
27313,"Vaccines do ""truly"" protect you from a virus 90-95% of the time."
27314,"Maybe not ""100%"", but even if everybody vaccinated around you vaccinated maybe YOU are one of the 5% who it doesnt work for."
27315,I dont understand what the issue is?
27316,"People are telling me ""I dont understand""."
27317,What am I not understanding?
27318,With people having chronic heart and lung problems I don't see why those schools are condemning the child to a lifetime of health issues.
27319,[removed]
27320,Texas too.
27321,Yeehaw.
27322,I did mainly psychedelics and ecstacy/mdma.

27324,"In Berlin, they closed the Christmas markets, but left the regular markets open."
27325,"They're exactly the same, and attract the same crowd sizes."
27326,"It might just be an oversight, but it's pretty silly regardless."
27327,"Yes, it does."
27328,"Tell me, which of the two strategies below does not involve herd immunity:

1) Use tracking and tracing to determine everyone exposed to the virus so that they can be quarantined and prevent them from spreading the virus to any more people."
27329,"If necessary declare a total quarantine if tracking and tracing can not keep up, and keep it in place until the level of infection drops low enough for tracking and tracing to work."
27330,"2) Don't bother doing tracking and tracing, or even widespread testing."
27331,Instead just recommend that people showing symptoms stay home.
27332,"Meanwhile, tell people that have been exposed to infected people that they should try to stay home, but only if their employer approves."
27333,Oh and children should still go to school (without masks) .
27334,"The goal in Sweden was to **slow** the spread, not **stop** it."
27335,"Any strategy not based on stopping the spread is by default a ""herd immunity"" strategy, because that is the only was the epidemic will end."
27336,I mean if they truly were taking every precaution they wouldn't have gotten sick.
27337,Someone in the group lied about something and was traveling / visiting it get sick in the first place
27338,"[Wear a Mask, Wear a Mask...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltjBT_TuUVA)"

27342,"Go back and read what you wrote, and my responses, and maybe think about it a bit."
27343,You'll understand eventually.
27344,I hope.
27345,I love stats people!
27346,Looks like USA is going to number 1 forever.
27347,Also not sure if you're trolling but we do know enough about SARS-CoV-2 to compare its rate of mutation to that of influenza.
27348,What are you talking about?
27349,Link or shut it.
27350,Imagining things that aren't actually happening but align with personal agendas seems to be very common among skeptics.
27351,I agree with you.
27352,The person I was replying to was implying that cases are past their peak in Iowa and things will get better.
27353,"Like you say, that is unlikely."
27354,I'm done with you.
27355,I’m in LA.
27356,Business as usual aside from bullshit restrictions no one follows
27357,Sad.
27358,Such assumptions (about it allergies) used to not be a big deal before 2020.
27359,Now it can screw up a lot of lives.
27360,What is your honest opinion from the countless records of long term issues?
27361,That’s because flu does lots of mutating from season to season.
27362,"Yes she keeps telling state ministers and citizens to social distance, stay at home etc... but telling doesn't do much... we need orders, not suggestions."
27363,"Best example: America and masks, there was no mask mandate for a long time in a lot of places, so many people ignored it."
27364,"After it was mandatory, people were needed to wear a mask, because if they didn't they would get sanctioned."
27365,"As a Bears fan, same here."
27366,"Kind of glad the rest of our country doesn't have to watch our ""offense"" at work this Thanksgiving."
27367,I'll take everything you said at face value and assume you are being genuine.
27368,"I'm a former IT person myself, so I'll make an analogy."
27369,"Oxford University, AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Moderna, these companies (and university) are like the Microsoft, IBM, Oracle, Cisco, Dell, HP of medicine."
27370,They employ legions of scientists with post doctoral degrees to do this kind of work.
27371,On top of that we have the regulatory bodies of several nations also reviewing the data before approving anything.
27372,Here's the analogy: for someone with an IT background to question the amount of scientific and medical knowledge and professional expertise within those organizations is analogous to when non IT people don't want us to install hotfixes or security patches to computers and systems.
27373,"If Microsoft says there is a remote execution exploit in whatever version of Windows everyone is running or Cisco says you need to update iOS in your router you just do it, you don't let a layman business or finance person stop you because they looked at the ""information"" and think they see conflicts."
27374,As an IT person you must understand how annoying it is for laypeople to argue with you about topics you know significantly more about than they do.
27375,"How do you think the researches at fucking Oxford university or the Doctor who devoted his entire life to fighting diseases at the NIH would feel in response to an IT person saying ""well I fix technology, and I looked at the information and I don't think I need this vaccine""."
27376,I have to imagine they would roll their eyes as hard as we do when we find out someone tried to download more RAM.
27377,This kind of thing is going to happen whenever we let a virus run roughshod through the entire country.
27378,"Low odds are low, but not zero."
27379,"Even a .0005% chance will hit someone if you have 12,000,000 cases."
27380,The issue also comes down to funding.
27381,Will governments fund vaccines that we don't necessarily need at the moment?
27382,"Covid has been a worldwide effort with massive amounts of attention and funding, but hopefully this can carry over to less popular diseases that still affect people a lot."
27383,"You know the UK could’ve just as easily closed the border, right?"
27384,But you’re right.
27385,They fucked up and didn’t lock down until it was too late.
27386,And I’m not using just two examples.
27387,Vietnam did it even better.
27388,Thailand did as well.
27389,Cambodia did as well.
27390,China did as well.
27391,Singapore is looking like it will go back to normal next month too.
27392,"So I’ve given you two western countries and a lot of Asian countries because, believe it or not, most of the world’s population is in Asia."

27416,Yes.
27417,We cannot be too careful.
27418,However it so hard to be vigilant 100%.
27419,It feels like waking a tightrope.
27420,Eventually you have to get off and rest.
27421,Even for a few seconds.
27422,It's not just about opinion.
27423,"If one person is going out because they don't care and the other is on hard lockdown, the relationship can erode quickly."
27424,Agreed
27425,So weird how they’re able to do that!
27426,This time my older (who is doing remote learning) got a cold and gave it to my younger (who is in-person).
27427,How did he get a cold?!?
27428,He doesn’t go anywhere!
27429,I'm totally new here.
27430,I've been into it with my mom for the last week because i told her we didn't feel comfortable attending Thanksgiving.
27431,"Its only an hour away, so we could drive, but it's indoors with anywhere from 13-20 people from 5 or so different households."
27432,"I didn't tell her not to do it, but I told her we're not coming."
27433,The guilt trip has been UNREAL and I'm a grown adult with my own family.
27434,I hope I'm making the right decision.
27435,Thank you for fighting the fight like the warrior that you are!
27436,I’m no healthcare worker but if I was I would have tapped out in March already.
27437,I’ll remember your post next time I’m not in the mood to wear a mask.
27438,I’ll put the damn thing on and keep my inner mouth shut.
27439,I wish you and your coworkers all the best.
27440,What's going to be hard for people to grasp will be the numbers at the end of December going into Jan.
27441,"The vaccine should hit hospital staff and first responders before the end of the year, according to the CDC."
27442,So chances are by Jan the public will know the vaccine has been approved and has begun rolling out.
27443,"But since the death numbers are delayed so much, the daily deaths will continue to rise."
27444,So people will be confronted with two bits of factual yet misleading information.
27445,The vaccine is being administered and deaths continue to climb.
27446,And most people will not be able to process that properly.
27447,Good point
27448,Yep even people that generally are social conscious are being stupid.
27449,I've watched my in laws engage in reckless behavior while simultaneously saying they're being careful.
27450,Spoiler: they're not.

27453,They think they're fine and it's overblown.

So you are in favor of abolishing health standards for businesses?"
27463,"That's what you keep saying, that nobody needs an authority to tell them right and wrong, and that is completely false."
27464,My example about sanitary standards in restaurants stands.
27465,This is about people's lives.
27466,"You are sitting here, arguing over and over that people should be allowed to endanger the health of other people just because 'people should have a choice'

27480,Great link.
27481,This was eye opening compared to other stuff I’ve been reading.
27482,Thanks for posting.
27483,That’s fair.
27484,"I don’t think the US will ever eliminate the virus, but as long as we can get cases down to manageable numbers, with a large percentage of folks vaccinated, I’m fine with repealing mask mandates."
27485,"Yeah most people can somehow ignore the fact that Trump got $600,000 first class treatment and drugs that aren't even available to the general public."
27486,"Idk how they can ignore that, but they do."
27487,You bring up an extremely valid point and why it pays to stay extremely safe right now.
27488,We just have no idea of the true long-term effects.
27489,Pieces of the puzzle are only starting to emerge from those infected months ago.
27490,Another area I’m keeping an eye on from a scientific (not media) standpoint.
27491,"No, many people who are scared aren't into conspiracy theories, it's not just an anti vax issue though they do contribute to spreading misinformation on past vaccines."
27492,I think regulations are good.

27502,"The virus likely made its way to the gathering through one family member whose job required her to work outside her home, Aragonez said."
27503,That family member attended the event with symptoms which she thought were just allergies.
27504,"According to an account of the event published by the Washington Post, family members didn't intend to gather indoors but fell back into old habits, including not wearing masks, as they ate cake and fajitas."

27534,"Social distancing was easier in the summer because you could have dinners and other social gatherings outside, restaurants had outdoor seating etc."
27535,"Sure some outdoor restaurants were quite crowded, but the virus doesn't spread nearly as easily outdoors."
27536,"Even if you were inside, you probably left lots of windows and doors open which increased airflow."
27537,"Then autumn hit, people started spending more time indoors, schools returned to in-person teaching, people went from walking and biking to using public transport, while at the same time, the colder weather also made it easier for the virus to spread."
27538,It's no wonder cases and deaths are increasing again.
27539,What the actual fuck is going on in America.
27540,That is insane.
27541,On so many levels.
27542,But probably the worst is that you pay for your own sub?
27543,Surely you’re pulling my leg?!?
27544,If I were you I would be looking to immigrate or moving to a more liberal state at least.
27545,They had 9 residents or about 20% die in 10 days.
27546,It’s terribly sad.
27547,25-30% of people are being honest.
27548,Current estimate among former and current healthcare workers I’ve talked to: early February 2021.
27549,Sign me up doc!
27550,I’ll gladly be a test tube for this vaccine.
27551,"&gt; I hope they have good reason to be confident in their analysis

Of course they don't, it's not statistically significant

That's why the official press release used the 70% and the 90% only filtered through days later in popular journalism"
27552,"Totally agree, Midwest checking in here 🤦🏻‍♂️"
27553,We're discussing the morality of the atomic bombs ... or any bombing of civilians.
27554,"You guys are whatabouting the thread by saying ""What about Japanese atrocities."""
27555,Well then leave the profession.
27556,Getting vaccinated against everything is part of the job.
27557,I personally think it's a benefit.
27558,When I got my first healthcare job and got my Hep C vaccine I was happy I didn't have to worry (that much) about Hep C.
27559,"You can't necessarily jump from myocarditis to MI, which is part of the problem here."
27560,It's true that COVID19 is having unprecedented long-term impacts on the heart but that is not the metric by which most people are discussing post-viral illness.
27561,"You can't base comparing two viral diseases on ""it wouldn't be a stretch to think the inflammation could be a problem elsewhere""."
27562,Lung cancer isn't contagious.
27563,Poland still have relatively low death count per capita.
27564,It's fashionable to point fingers at a country which is currently doing the worse.
27565,I think well into 2nd wave which hit everyone heavily it's time to stop playing that particular game.
27566,"Check death per capita of your country, it may well be still higher than that of Poland."
27567,Stop putting links in the title.
27568,"It bothers me that these patients are regarded as ""recovered"" in official counts."
27569,If this is recovery I hope to stay as far away from covid illness as possible.
27570,Is this a serious question?
27571,Have you not been in a grocery store recently?
27572,In a pharmacy?
27573,How about a hair salon?
27574,A restaurant?
27575,Passed by a government building?
27576,Nearly every public-facing boss out there is telling employees to come back to work with the public.
27577,"Even if masks are required for employees, they often aren’t enforced for customers."
27578,Hundreds of customers a day x Y% unmasked = a fuckton of exposure for these people
27579,"That “different opinion” could get someone killed, dipshit."
27580,"Careful, I was able to live like that, in my own bubble in USA for almost 4 years."
27581,But it will catch you up.
27582,"You get to the point that you find one you like or love, just to find out is supporting the wakos in power, and you get to the point where it is above and beyond politics, as you recognize that this person is a jeopardizing you way of life."

27584,"No, everybody knows you're the one who decides."

27587,Who were massively downvoted for posting links that proved in 10 different ways that herd immunity was the goal?
27588,the others.
27589,"It's wild that back early this year, I thought that a couple dozen USA deaths from COVID would smarten up people."
27590,"Then a few hundred, then a few thousand."
27591,Now I have no idea what will change minds.
27592,Yet it seems highly unlikely that US financial market will drop or that Senate will pass another stimulus bill
27593,That's why I said a couple to a few months after it's widely available.
27594,Experts are saying March/April for that.
27595,"So if it takes about 1.5 months from the initial dose to be protected, then a couple of months after it's widely available cases will start to drop dramatically and a mask order wouldn't really be justified anymore."
27596,"And 60% of Americans would take it, we'll also have anywhere from 5-15% of Americans who have already had it."
27597,"Probably just the world of the last few weeks, and by “world” they probably just used the various American states, and grouped the EU as one entity"

27606,3/4 of my relatives there caught COVID and many of their friends did.
27607,They think it's a big joke.
27608,They still post pictures of their get togethers on social media.
27609,"The ones that have had it now think they're invincible, the ones that haven't had it think it's no big deal."
27610,"So because you have the luxury of staying home, you also have the luxury to visit your family and then judge essential workers for doing so?"
27611,"I'm

Even if it's not directly applicable to you, that's pretty much the implication of what you're saying."
27612,"Add on top of that the truth that must essential workers are paid far less than those of us that get to sit on our butts at home, and you have another element of class privilege that only serves to fuck us all in the end."
27613,Just read an article about how traveling nurses are now costing upwards of 10k a week.
27614,Last time NY had an issue the rest of the country was available.
27615,Now that most states are overwhelmed it's no longer as simple as building a field hospital.
27616,Although NY can pay enough to lure the nurse away; that just means the nurse isn't helping/saving a life in the other place.
27617,"We just have too many sick people; we needed to ""flatten the curve"" to avoid this
 Field hospials aren't the solution when 85k+ people are hospitalized with Covid"
27618,"I guess if you're already on death row, whatcha got to lose."
27619,"I’m not trying to defend going out with friends and shit, but I’ve also had similar anecdotal experiences to the op, I’ve had roughly 10 friends that got it, I don’t think any of them had to go to the hospital (tbh most of them tried to kill it with alcohol s/) but ya I’m a college student."
27620,I make a pretty good effort at staying inside and usually am only with my roommate and girlfriend.
27621,I just know a lot of kids my age stopped caring because it seems like a minor flu to them.
27622,"I understand your point, the pandemic sucks."
27623,"But what is your proposed solution, besides saying ""fuck it, if they die, they die""?"
27624,Pressure on the economy is to big... government doesn't have the guts to do it.
27625,That’s fair.
27626,It’s just so rampant on this sub to misrepresent facts for even more doom and gloom.
27627,"There was a comment upvoted to the top a few days ago that predicted the overall deaths using an IFR of 2%, which is double what even the most pessimistic sources predict."
27628,"COVID is incredibly bad, especially in the US."
27629,"One doesn’t need to use blatant falsehoods to prove that point, the truth is enough."
27630,If you think that's enough people and time....good luck!
27631,Those who die because of this callousness should haunt them.Holidays will be there next year or the year after that too.We have technology to keep in touch .
27632,Honestly I was surprised this means at least 50% of people will heed the warning.
27633,If you read each of their stories only one of them actually tested positive for Covid...
27634,The 78 year old woman.
27635,"They (or their doctors) all just ""guess"" that they had it."
27636,"That 27 year old dude simply said he ""confirmed he was a covid long hauler"", OK how??"
27637,"lol Also, please read this from Dr. Gerald Evans at the end of the article:

&gt;When it comes to studying the presentation of long-term symptoms, Dr. Gerald Evans, chair of the division of infectious diseases at Queen’s University and Kingston Health Sciences Centre, said **it’ll be important to distinguish between those who’ve been truly infected with COVID-19 and those for whom there’s no evidence they’ve ever had the virus."
27638,"**

&gt;For people who haven’t received an official coronavirus diagnosis but are observing long-term effects, Stevens said **they should get a serological test, which measures antibodies in the bloodstream that are associated with SARS-CoV-2."
27639,"**

&gt;“It becomes tricky because a lot of the symptoms that people are reporting are not terribly specific — things like trouble concentrating, headache, brain fog,” he said."
27640,"**“These can be symptoms of a number of other things as well.”**

I think it's honestly just fearmongering."
27641,The virus is already bad enough that we don't need this kind of nonsense.
27642,Cuz the us is more spread out ..
27643,10s of thousands of people already are.
27644,"I don't know who this ""everyone"" is but I will say that masked in a retail environment is far less likely to have you be sick at the end of the day than unmasked in a social environment eating food at the same table."
27645,"I still wouldn't go out on Black Friday, but I wouldn't do that any year."
27646,It's madness.
27647,"Most big retailers aren't having DOORBUSTER SAVINGS where people acting like a herd of animals climbing on top of one another to escape a predator burst into the doors and then fight over $40 tvs this year, and instead have online deals all month."
27648,And I think there are not that many people that will go.
27649,"THAT SAID, some big brain people probably think ""this is the year!"
27650,"no one will be there because of the pandemic!"""
27651,"and these people, literally the worst people in our country, will still show up, even though there really isn't the same level of sales as normal years."
27652,Because flying to Australia and New Zealand is an hours long flight regardless of what land mass you’re coming from?
27653,Travel from the UK and back is convenient for a couple European countries.
27654,You can be in England in less than hour from France.
27655,Lmao.
27656,They fucked by by implementing a bad strategy and genuinely believing that when people would really forgo interacting with each other.
27657,"You keep using these two golden examples but at the end of the day, that’s all you have."
27658,Out of hundreds of countries.
27659,The statistics are not in your favor.
27660,It’s a bad strategy.
27661,"The overwhelming majority of the time, they don’t work."
27662,"I’ve had a rough year so I’m probably not making myself clearly, and I’m sorry for that."
27663,"My point was that even IF you did all that silly stuff, you could still get sick."
27664,"It was an intentionally absurd example

So treating someone like it’s inherently their fault if they got sick is based in feeling and not fact."
27665,You can do everything right and still be unlucky.

27682,"Sorry peasants, Dow hit 30k, no soup for you."
27683,- White house
27684,Back in March during the first lockdown we were doing pretty great.
27685,We had like 10-20 new cases a day.
27686,I hope the new lockdown helps.
27687,It sucks.
27688,"As a medical worker who caught Covid taking care of patients back in May, this is a hard pill to swallow."
27689,I’m leaving the hospital to work in a different environment because fuck people; it sucks.
27690,essential worker is such a murky definition i hope they class it better.
27691,"I am an ""essential worker"" that is excused from curfews etc... but I'm not sure if I need to be getting the vaccine first."
27692,&gt;They are counted as tests but not as new cases.
27693,It seems to depend on the state?
27694,Here is [California](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4406HU_i2Y) where they say they do count multiple positives as multiple cases.
27695,"According to [this out of Oregon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y308gLWS5FI), they *dont* count multiple postives, but then at the end of the video she says they sometimes do."
27696,So it doesnt seem to be consistent at all.
27697,"Once again, doesn't say that"
27698,"I know a lot of people who have made it sound like they're ""laying low"" for Thanksgiving or whatever, and then come to find out they're actually going to see their parents and siblings at someone's house."
27699,"It's just that they ""know my family is also being careful"" and it's under 10 people, which is technically not against guidelines where I live."
27700,"And I'm like, FFS, it might be under 10 people but it is FIVE different households, dude."
27701,That is increasing your risk bigtime.
27702,I've also heard from several friends lately that someone in their family caught it and doesn't even know where they got it.
27703,People who have only left the house to go to the grocery store or a doctor appointment are getting it.
27704,Because that's what happens even if we all wear masks when SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE IT.
27705,It's only going to get worse in these next few weeks.
27706,Again??
27707,?
27708,"If it only affects them, sure no problem."
27709,"But if they get Covid, they spread it to other people."
27710,"Wearing a mask isnt about protecting yourself, its about protecting others."
27711,Their selfishness is getting other people killed.
27712,"Have you read the follow-up where he says he was not informed of such a strategy, but rather made it up himself?"
27713,That's how things get really bad.
27714,You accept things that are bad for you to get the temporary relief.
27715,But the relief doesn't last and you're just stuck with the bad.
27716,Are they positive this time?
27717,DeSantis is demented.
27718,"Exactly, I have a feeling that people are way over-dramatizing on this sub."
27719,"Of course, I am not saying to be neglect the basic measures, for example, wearing a mask when indoors and limit pubs/bars/restaurants."
27720,"I,myself, only wear a mask when in indoor public spaces, went on two vacations (within my own country of course (Bulgaria)),saw some friends there, basically no safety measures were in place for the whole period and fortunately nothing happened."
27721,"Then, we went to two different weddings back in September, again nothing happened (fortunately)."
27722,"However, recently my sister was flying back from Austria and she tested positive few days later."
27723,"Fortunately, nothing happened and had little to no syptoms."
27724,Me and the wife have not decided yet whether to get together at Xmass though as the sitiation here is escalating and another partial lockdown was implemented and it is scheduled to be lifted by Xmass.
27725,Will see depending on the situation I guess.
27726,Stay safe everyone!
27727,If that’s the way you want to look at it more power to ya bud.
27728,lol first it was “because they’re islands” and now it’s “because they’re isolated”.
27729,"Yeah keep thinking that way and enjoy your continued life of restrictions, until there’s a vaccine I guess."
27730,"He has very good references, I'm sure: his proctologist and his mother."
27731,Costing the hospital maybe but they aren't making that much
27732,I definitely agree.
27733,Glad we can shake hands on it not being a herd immunity strategy
27734,It is bad.
27735,"My boss, his wife and their 2 year old daughter were sick last week."
27736,They are fine now.
27737,And almost every other day I hear of someone dead or in pretty bad condition due to COVID.
27738,And I'm from a city with around 30k population.
27739,"Funny thing is, 90% of people are wearing masks."
27740,"Back in March during the first lockdown, we were doing pretty great, one of the best in Europe, because we shut almost everything down and tookbthe situation pretty seriously."
27741,I hope the second lockdown will help.
27742,I have flown in to JFK 3 weeks ago and refuse to provide my information.
27743,I told them to basically take a hike and that was the end of conversion.
27744,They knew they couldn't enforce anything.
27745,"Same thing with out of state quarantine mandate, it's not enforceable"
27746,&gt;Lol I’ve said my piece.
27747,"Lol, Peace, genius."
27748,"Not the sharpest one, are you?"
27749,Why are you embarrassing yourself by jumping into discussions beyond your ability to participate coherently?
27750,The key point is people think that the strategy relied on herd immunity through spread.
27751,Every single country will eventually see immunity through vaccines
27752,"It's hard to tell if the same person went to both the church service *and* the blood donation center or if it was a second-degree connection but, holy hell, that is some next level mental gymnastics if it was the former."
27753,Are they doing CT scans?
27754,"I know a lot of these types of tests are not given if someone's vitals and bloodwork are normal, unless the patient really demands it."
27755,Enjoy it while you can.
27756,It’s an antibody therapy most won’t be able to afford nor is it wildly distributed yet.

27764,"Because people are stupid, they will believe a lie because they want to  believe it's true, or because they are afraid it might be true. """
27765,My wife's family has a ton of hardcore evangelical crazy people in it that eat up alt-right talking points like they're candy.
27766,I just cut all these people out of my life because I'm not going to deal with their bullshit.
27767,Everything is drama all the time because of made up insults and conspiracy theories like how the coronavirus vaccine has a chip in it to track you that was designed by Bill Gates...
27768,If we could make GPS tracking chips that small that don't need a battery it would be a revolutionary breakthrough that would change the world dramatically.
27769,But these nitwits that got a C in rudimentary science in high school think they know better than actual doctors and scientists who have spent their lives working on this stuff.
27770,Context matters.
27771,&gt; You __don’t think__ more and more people are becoming more relaxed about the whole thing?
27772,"&gt; __I don’t__, no."
27773,"__From what I’ve seen__ in the 4 states I’ve lived throughout my life (2 mostly liberal, 2 mostly conservative) __it’s pretty much the same thing:__ people either being cautious or not, ever since the first lockdown."
27774,I’m not saying there’s not varying degrees of caution.
27775,I’m just saying I haven’t seen any drastic changes in anyone’s behavior that would lead me to worry about people suddenly throwing caution to the wind just because the first phases of vaccines are rolled out to a minority of people.
27776,The people who care about others and listen to the experts will more than likely continue to do so.
27777,There’s no evidence that those who take currently small risks won’t suddenly take large ones.
27778,It’s just fear mongering.
27779,"The issue is not just having the beds, you need qualified health care professionals to care for these very ill patients."
27780,stop whining your governor thinks its just fine!
27781,!
27782,How many died?
27783,Zero?
27784,Cool...
27785,"They can, but you have to do that on a lot of people to determine a result."
27786,The battle between your vaccinated jump started immune system and an entry event of the virus could be different in people based on a lot of factors.
27787,That duration period and how far the virus manages to spread in your body before the immune system wins will be different for every person.
27788,We just don’t know yet as to what that data looks like and I’m not even sure we can figure it out.
27789,"Certainly there is a hypothesis that if the vaccine prevents serious covid disease and it definitely seems that it does in the vast majority of cases, that the response of the immune system is powerful enough and fast enough that it will prevent the virus from reaching the ability to shed itself which does require some level of replication in the body before it can start doing that."
27790,But this isn’t a simple on off switch.
27791,This is a battle and it’ll be different in everyone.
27792,The hope is that it’s closer to wiping out the virus in your body before it can reach the state where you become contagious.
27793,"That guy himself said that he was in no way informed of any such strategy by FHM, and apologized for it."
27794,There are articles on it
27795,"The other individual commented on why your statement on mortality is misleading to the point of incorrectness, but in addition to be clear, the vast majority of vaccine side effects present within 60 days, not ""months/years after they are introduced."""
27796,"And yet, he’s STILL hosting people for Thanksgiving."
27797,I like to think of humanity as one organism.
27798,"It's really sick right now and it's going to hurt to get through, but once we're on the other side we will appreciate what we have and hopefully work towards a better tomorrow."
27799,I'm hoping this is a huge wake up call that we need to take better care of ourself.
27800,If you read the article.
27801,One of the members of the family has a job that required them to leave their house.
27802,They went to the party because they thought that their C19 symptoms were allergies.
27803,"My dad tested positive for covid this morning, got it from his asshole boss who was at a wedding of 200+ people recently."
27804,At least my mom tested negative for now.
27805,"So far no serious symptoms, just beyond pissed at fucking idiots like his boss."
27806,Not sure if this is ME/CFS.
27807,Jury is still out if there is measurable physical damage.
27808,"Some of it probably is ME/CFS but I'm betting some of it is measurable lung, heart, and brain damage."

27879,"It sucks to have to avoid them, especially with our daughter being almost 2, but its what we have to do if they refuse to do their part."

27895,"i'm not flying or travelling out of state, because that would also be very dumb."

27921,Why would you think things would magically get better in January?
27922,I’ve seen the numbers in the US and Europe and... sorry to say it’s not looking so good.
27923,Bill Gates has a bad history of vaccination programs in under-developed countries.
27924,He has constantly called for population reduction.
27925,He is behind the moderna vaccine which will end up being the #1 candidate.
27926,"If you wanted to goto a restaurant and all of the reviews said the restaurant was bad and they were dirty etc, would you still want to eat there?"
27927,That’s what I’m saying.
27928,"If he didn’t ever call for population reduction, if he didn’t sponsor failed vaccination campaigns then maybe more people would trust the vaccine."
27929,Look what happened with the Polio vaccine.
27930,We can’t just roll over and let them do this to us without questioning them.
27931,The problem is that the media is in bed with them because media ownership is between 2 -3 families and Bill Gates is part of those families.
27932,Basically nobody has.
27933,These are generally outliers.
27934,Fortunately.
27935,Still scary
27936,"Yep, my argument from the getgo"
27937,That could lead to civil unrest which could fracture our country at this point.

27939,We’re overpopulated as it is.

27941,*mild shock*
27942,Not necessarily.
27943,I know a family that caught it while in totally lockdown.

27960,The US is celebrating Thanksgiving tomorrow; arguably the biggest holiday where everyone gathers with family from across the country.
27961,Expect those levels by Xmas.
27962,The OP is the one who misread the article which is from a Japanese news source not an American one.
27963,"Japan’s hospitals are on average (without Covid) above 70% (80% - [source](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1112150/japan-monthly-hospital-bed-occupancy-rate-by-type-of-hospital/) 

That is a why 25% occupancy rate for only Covid patients is a crisis."
27964,"If there is a state unemployment system, yes."
27965,How much are we going to move the goal post here because in your previous comment you said there aren't unemployment benefits
27966,We need to help ourselves by putting in the right people to guide resources to the right places to beat things like this.
27967,We DID NOT do that these past few years.
27968,January will be better.
27969,Nah I’m going to go sit in my car for 8 hours on Thanksgiving when nothing is open to visit and no places to eat.
27970,"Then when it is ‘safe’, I’ll return to five people who were all openly exposed if someone was positive."
27971,That makes a ton of sense.
27972,"First, thank you for the discussion."
27973,Isn’t that the entire point of traveling nurses?
27974,We are talking infrastructure not staff.
27975,"Having a physically larger building with more contingency beds and rooms I personally don’t see as that a huge expense, but maybe I’m overlooking something."
27976,"Yes the equipment would be a bit of a cost, but not insane."
27977,Maybe they should be mandated to do it by US government regulations.
27978,"“Must have 15% extra beds compared to average maximum occupancy per year” we already require nuclear power plants to do all kinds of stuff in the name of safety, same thing with air travel."
27979,I feel like this is not done due to the government being scared of a cost increase.
27980,The fact is that our medical costs in the US aren’t remotely cheap.
27981,I think we should get what we pay for.
27982,I don’t think it’s too much to ask for a bit of extra infrastructure.
27983,Where is the money going?
27984,"(I realize that’s a different discussion probably but it’s still frustrating)

I also realize that this is arguing about the barn door after the horse has already ran away, but I just think it’s absurd with medical costs being so high in this country that the hospital system seems almost ran like a airline or bus service where they want to be full but not overloaded with patients."
27985,Also we really haven’t discussed that “ICU bed occupancy projection tool” the AHA website.
27986,It’s linked in my last comment.I see only one state above 90%.
27987,GA.
27988,"I only see one state over 80%, IL."
27989,And the IMHE has overestimated in the past.
27990,"Good luck to him enforcing that curfew, especially being we are talking about Texas"
27991,I went to a school where you were kicked out.
27992,"Normally for winter holidays and not thanksgiving, but I think the school year was adjusted this year to end around thanksgiving."
27993,I think my old college had very few if any people on campus and just didn't let people live on campus this semester.
27994,"I don’t think he was arguing that catching yellow fever isn’t worse than catching covid, but that yellow fever kills a lot fewer people than covid right now since we have a yellow fever vaccine but not a covid vaccine."
27995,I know that yellow fever does kill far fewer people than covid in a year but I don’t know what the numbers were like for yellow fever pre-vaccine.
27996,Obviously yellow fever is a worse disease to catch but far far fewer people catch it.
27997,Agreed!
27998,I studied immunology at UT so studying this virus has been a huge blessing as far as safety for my little family.
27999,I’m actually 35 weeks pregnant and this is the second round of COVID for my in-laws and their older kids; it’s huge deal for my husband and I.
28000,We were requiring everyone to have covid testing and quarantine for a week before seeing my baby but I’m not too sure that’s actually going to help.
28001,I think based on all the evidence it would be safest to wait until a vaccine is available for everyone.
28002,We have to be so careful.
28003,"My husbands family live in the giant red bubble of infection near Houston, TX."

28007,"&gt; &gt; South Bend, Ind.-based Beacon Health System had one of its hospitals report 27 COVID-19-related deaths so far this month, a grim record it hasn't faced in earlier virus stages."

28009,im sitting here wondering why we arent dragging the rich and politicians out on the streets

28012,"Masks are mandatory for the students, but like your case, teachers don't have to wear them if they're in a room without students."
28013,"Cases are continuing to increase in our area, but our governor, state DOE, and many of our superintendents have taken a Lord Farquaad approach:  ""Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make."""
28014,“Will cause a crisis”.
28015,"There, I fixed it for them."
28016,"“It’s not worse yet.”

28116,What am I not controlling?
28117,I'm controlling everything that is within my power.
28118,"Again, shove it."
28119,In Canada it's the same.
28120,"You could fake it for like 2 bucks, it has to be something that can't be counterfeited easily or it won't be of any use."
28121,This makes a lot of sense to me.
28122,I found out yesterday he is asymptotic  so perhaps people who have less of an immune response don’t develop the level of antibodies someone with mild-severe covid would see.
28123,just go look at sweden covid reddit posts several moths back and you'll see swedes inside those posts say how herd immunity would come out on top.
28124,We won’t even be able to track these stories after Thanksgiving as it’ll just be the norm as all these science denying fools try to wrestle with their guilt.....and then there’s the group that will still claim they have something else as they die in the street because the hospitals are saturated.
28125,I know that I read the article.
28126,But I question the persons interactions at work and what the work place was like.
28127,Masked to masked transmission is a very low percent.
28128,So it means someone was walking around without a mask at work.
28129,Remindme!
28130,Six months
28131,My biggest beef is that we aren’t doing the stuff that’s free.
28132,Masking is basically free.
28133,Setting up chairs to maintain distancing is free.
28134,Canceling certain unwise things is free.
28135,Going zoom instead of in person meetings is free.
28136,"On a board I sit on I am constantly questioning why we are still having physical meetings and if we are, why they aren’t set up in the largest room available with chairs at least 6 feet apart and mentioning that masks need to stay on not just on the way into the meeting."
28137,Instead it’s 8-12 people in a room for an hour or two where we all sit at a long table 3-4 feet apart and where people wear masks on the way in and then sit down and take them off.
28138,There is a zoom option available and a greater % of people are taking advantage of it.
28139,And those who aren’t are baffled thinking they are talking some precautions so what’s the big deal.
28140,Last week someone in attendance without a mask had the audacity to ask if I thought a very inherently close quarters  (impossible to apply coronavirus mitigation strategies) part of the program that I oversee might be ready to resume indoors in January.
28141,I just told him not a chance.
28142,100% no.
28143,The ruling ideology of a lot of Republicans and wage a lot of democrats is that the “market knows best”.
28144,"States were left to their own devices regarding PPE, competing against FEMA and other states."
28145,"The idea of competing against one another to secure the best outcome for yourself is exactly the ideology of the market, just being forced upon states in a pandemic for life saving equipment."
28146,"We never really shut down, managed expectations of the last 30 years is the government shouldn’t (but can) do things for people."
28147,Back before Easter of this year you had people talking about how this crisis isn’t that bad and we need to make sacrifices (so what if grandma dies ?)
28148,for the economy.
28149,"Or managed expectations and paternalistic brow beating about unemployment making people not return to work, so we should cut it so they suffer along the path to normalcy."
28150,It’s pure market ideology
28151,"No way, their entire family was sick."
28152,Dad was high fever coughing and mom lost sense of smell.
28153,I agree with what you are saying in that we've reached such a point where it's out of control.
28154,"However masks do work, and more of it would help slow down the virus's acceleration."
28155,It's not much better for big businesses either outside the lucky few that have benefited from this.
28156,Neither did I?
28157,"you can control your own behavior, and yet.."
28158,"and yet cold &amp; flu still mostly spread in winter even in TX, FL, AZ, right?"
28159,"And then TX, FL, AZ outbreaks went into steep decline in July, way before the end of summer misery (and, IIRC, TX&amp;FL were explicitly refusing to reintro any restrictions)."
28160,"Also, Northern California has a far less miserable summer yet got an outbreak of its own in July.."
28161,It's very hard to fit these into seasonality-is-the-driving-factor.
28162,I know that.
28163,This will blow over once the vaccine is released.
28164,"The airlines like money, so they will eventually stop enforcing this."
28165,"Same issue with the mRNA vaccines, nobody has seen the full dataset but we’re moving ahead with approvals for drugs that will be injected into hundreds of millions of Americans."
28166,"Maybe these incredible results are representative but we have no way of understanding that based on what’s been released and there are serious questions that remain, some of which that can’t be answered because of the unusual trial design we’re seeing for these drugs."
28167,These vaccines are being treated like breakthrough cancer treatments and that’s unusual.
28168,"Same thing happened in BC - teachers were gearing up for hybrid style teaching with only kids of essential workers being full time in class and then the education ministry decided - without consulting the teachers - that instead it would be full time, 5 days a week."
28169,"Our cases aren’t anywhere near as bad, but for a spread out province of 5 million, more than half live in one metro area and we are seeing the highest level of infections ever and school is still chugging along."
28170,New Jersey
28171,If only the US had a government that could coordinate and execute a national response instead of leaving it up to individual states to manage on their own.
28172,They never shut down airlines in the first place
28173,"True, but we also have had lots of terrible legislation like NLCB."
28174,"We could also be use additional federal funding nationwide to help do things like a nationwide pre-k program, etc; or extra money for states so that they can find and recruit more talented teachers."
28175,"Lots of things that the national government can do, but refuses to do so."
28176,Who cares how big their tourism numbers during a normal year are?
28177,Lol those are planned trips with the caveat that the arrival is a hassle.
28178,There is a lot of travel involved no matter where you’re coming from.
28179,But people travel between European countries like it’s a run to the grocery store.
28180,Like what?
28181,😂
28182,“Will”.
28183,"There, I fixed it for them."
28184,"i think the majority was swedes themselves telling everyone how this herd immunity strat is, now they are denying it."
28185,My mother is 86 years old.
28186,"Fuck this whole ""well, it's only old people"" bullshit."
28187,OLD PEOPLE ARE STILL HUMAN BEINGS WITH FAMILIES THAT LOVE THEM.
28188,Maybe that's what needs to happen instead of slowly ripping the band-aid off.
28189,What's scary is that it looks just like half of the US.
28190,[removed]
28191,"100K or 900K, that’s still two *thousand* people dead *in one day*."
28192,Where *exactly* is the glass half full perspective here?
28193,Luckily for you there are many other vaccines.
28194,The BioNTek (developed in Germany) one will be my choice I think.
28195,But you can always go for Putins or the Chinese one.
28196,What was their reaction to that?
28197,You're saying the state of Washington has suspended its whole unemployment program?
28198,That would be national news.
28199,Why would this be true?
28200,Also it's weird that you're shitting on seattle if you dont live here
28201,[removed]
28202,"I miss people that I didn’t think I’d miss, it’s so dreadful."
28203,Well maybe not ALL of us.
28204,But w decent amount
28205,I think it's quite dystopian for private entities with no accountability to become the arbiters of truth and silence anything they deem false.
28206,2020 is really quite a turning point it feels.
28207,Feels like the open internet is on its last limbs.
28208,"That's sadly covid fatigue, people just dont care as much anymore"
28209,"Full update:

- New cases: 16,289

- Positivity rate: 9.4% (+0.1)

- In hospital: 17,354 (+491)

- In ICU: 3,779 (+37)

- New deaths: 381"
28210,"At first I was confused about this, because at the Research Lab (aka RIC) I think they have some freezers, as well as liquid nitrogen dewars."
28211,"But then it occurred to me that maybe they want to keep using those for materials science etc., and they may be installing some of these freezers at plants, not just near HQ."
28212,Has a hard on against China because he knows his country fkd up the covid response.

28227,Yeah pretty much.
28228,I go to the grocery once a week or two and that's pretty much the only people i see.
28229,This should remain the top comment.
28230,Well in this case the state legislature is actively preventing the governor from doing anything.
28231,Their only actions over the past 8 months have been to undo any restrictions put in place by the governor.
28232,So in this case it is extremely hard for him to do it.
28233,[deleted]
28234,Lol no wonder our country is so fucked over.
28235,Thats probably the same thing a lot of people who died said.

28246,"Reading a headline or someone online scream ""it's like 10 9/11's a day!!"""
28247,is simply NOT going to be as impactful.
28248,"People aren't watching videos of people dying alone and terrified, their relatives crying over a zoom call."
28249,It's totally removed and people feel totally removed as a result.
28250,It needs to be seen.

28254,Nah just telling him to tell his grandpa that his life isn’t worth living and he should die.
28255,That’s all.
28256,Just promoting honesty to see how that grandpa would feel about it that’s all.
28257,Maybe there is something to my point huh?
28258,Gotta keep us scared
28259,"No, they’ll not be open before February."
28260,The chances are greatly diminished with all the above that you will spread the virus to others (assuming you socially distance + mask + only go to places that are adhering to strict protocols).
28261,"Yes, this is not enforceable in the United States, which is why we aren't vacationing there."
28262,"I feel safer here than I do in my hometown grocery store where they don't enforce masking and people are intentionally not socially distancing because, you know, 'merica."
28263,So she isnt going to go anywhere and interact with anyone that can potentially catch something that you bring over?
28264,You do potentially when you drive back?
28265,Am i supposed to know what exactly you drive to determine the mpg and how far 160 minutes round trip is for you?
28266,"You gave no information about the actual distance, the terrain youre driving, the speed youd drive at, or your car."
28267,Dont patronize me if you dont understand how cars work.
28268,"Let me put it this way: You can lie to people, but you can't lie to a virus."
28269,"If it's not effective, it's not going to help anyone who takes it, and that will be painfully obvious when infection rates do not improve among those who have taken it."
28270,btw.
28271,are universities in France still open?
28272,"The ""ToS violation"" is a common scam that has been used to censor conservatives by Big Tech in the last few years."
28273,"OANN might be very conservative, but they have the same rights as extremely liberal VICE, and should be treated the same way."
28274,"You don't see YouTube suspending accounts that claim that Trump's legal challenges and requests for recounts, which he has a right and duty to demand, are ""a coup""."
28275,"While nobody is mentioning what the ""fake cure"" was, if it was the casirivimab/imdevimab cocktail, the one that was given to Trump by Regeneron, that is an FDA-approved treatment for COVID-19."
28276,It could also be reporting on a vaccine that YouTube is claiming as a cure.
28277,Actually if they deny access to the content this is a violation to GDPR...
28278,So they are breaking the law willingly :D
28279,Yes this news is so motivating for me.
28280,"I don't want to get infected right before a vaccine, like a chump."
28281,I'm being soooooo careful now.
28282,"I was being so careful before, but now more o's."

28284,Headline is super misleading then.
28285,Internet hugs still count as hugs.

28288,"Oh, you guys are pretending you didn't know it was only old and fat people now?"
28289,It’s going to be a cozy Covid new year!
28290,You can visit for Christmas but you’ll be gone by January!
28291,A couple million people traveling to see grampa and gramma.
28292,What could go wrong?
28293,And do you like that?
28294,A regular fridge is good enough for storage on the last few days apparently.
28295,So they only need a few central hubs for longer storage.
28296,This should work even in the giant US.
28297,"&gt;Outdoor mask wearing was not mandatory and everyone was outside, so I'm not sure much was accomplished."
28298,It sounded no different from Florida to me.
28299,"Yeah, but everything we're hearing is that the virus doesn't spread outdoors."
28300,That's the basis of most of the guidance.
28301,Talk to CMS about it.
28302,It’s their rules.
28303,I think it comes down to the language.
28304,"They have the RIGHT to fall, staff has the DUTY to minimize the risks for potential falls."
28305,Risks should be identified and mitigated.

28319,Compliance was a huge problem in Spain.
28320,It's a small square of material.
28321,What's the big deal?
28322,Iowa is such a shit show right now.
28323,I work at a grocery story in the south east corner and it's only been in the past week that 90% of the customers have been wearing a mask.
28324,The remaining 10% are still spewing conspiracy theories.
28325,Did they try?
28326,&gt; That doesn't explain the upsurge in Europe compared to other places alone.
28327,People in Europe gave up during the summer and stopped wearing masks.
28328,"Sorry but, it does explain it."
28329,CDC's conflicting and confusing guidance is partially to blame for anti-maskers.
28330,"The US Military presence in these countries allowed them to spend their resources in the 1950s, 60's, and early 70s, on things other than defense."
28331,Including healthcare.
28332,"Well if they die in their car waiting in the hospital parking lot its a motor vehicle death, not COVID."
28333,Problem solved.
28334,Thank you.
28335,Local health department or maybe try the airport/airline?
28336,Except you don't even know that they didn't try.
28337,In your world if they don't do it it means they didn't try.
28338,It might take 2 years to make a facility capable of producing 100 doses.
28339,These are important things to know before going on rants about how much they failed.
28340,My best friends parents are both doctors and think that masks don’t do anything
28341,Officer Officer *does* have a certain ring to it.
28342,I wear the gators and they already said those are like not wearing masks at all.
28343,Just do the candle blow out test.
28344,You can’t blow out the candle with the paper mask on.
28345,"he might have been thinking of oxford, who promised 300 mln doses to the US (not by the end of the year, but that might be what floated into his head)"
28346,I live in Boston and I have seen maybe 5 people without a mask on indoors since March.
28347,"And I have had to go into work almost every week, and been walking around Boston on the weekends."
28348,Most days I look at people during my commute and I see maybe 1 person out of hundreds without a mask outside.
28349,"I guess it's different out of the city, but most people are taking it seriously here and I make sure I pay attention all the time."
28350,Forrest Gump had something to say about that.
28351,This thread should be exempt from the non-politics rule.
28352,"I mean, come on."
28353,"Pretty tough to not say anything political when OANN is Russian propaganda masquerading as American ""news""."
28354,Smart in their field.
28355,There's plenty of doctors who are fucking idiots beyond the scope of science.
28356,The worst part is when the roomates come back and infect you.
28357,I’m in the same situation.
28358,Skipping thanksgiving but roommate left to go to thanksgiving...
28359,And the worst thing most Canadians are sheep who won’t punish the govt for having dramatically f**ked this up just because we appear better than our neighbors to the south.
28360,But hey at least they will get their pop vaccinated what 6 months before ours...
28361,This is news how ?
28362,I can go into my rural SuperCenter and see that many (or more) without masks any morning.
28363,Our lab test positivity rate is now creeping above 10%.
28364,SMH
28365,Look at the data.
28366,"If you're past the peak and hospitals are fine, what's the evidence to suggest a New York style ""collapse"" which wasn't even technically a collapse as only a few hospitals hit capacity and the USS Comfort and the field hospital set up in Central Park remained mostly empty?"
28367,"Wow, didn't know that."
28368,"About his donors and rural Alberta, who would elect a stick if it was painted blue."
28369,I‘ve learned that you can‘t stop stupid.
28370,Stupid finds a way.
28371,There‘s nothing you can do if people don’t listen and police don‘t enforce bans.
28372,"Well, either the companies flatly lied and will be found out in two weeks- a very bold move on their part with not much foresight involved- or the people in charge of logistics should solidify plans now so there's not a mad scramble to even have a plan when the vaccines do get approved."
28373,Seems pretty simple tbh
28374,Wow.
28375,"So, are people happy, then?"
28376,That their loved ones have been called home?
28377,What are cured people?
28378,The rejected?
28379,What’s it like having a chicken for a wife?
28380,"The House bill was intentionally designed to not pass the Senate, so the Democrats and allied media can blame the GOP for harming America."

28408,You should be in isolation 10 days from the onset of symptoms.
28409,I'd imagine your local Health Department will be in contact with you shortly.
28410,What's a stunning number these days?
28411,3000 a day?
28412,5000 day?
28413,"10,000 would be stunning I guess."
28414,Can't see it getting that high.
28415,Healthcare services becoming overwhelmed is already baked into the current number of new infections in many areas of the country (it is approximately 12 days between the new infection being reported and the hospitalization of that same patient being reported).
28416,What this means is you CANNOT count on there being critical medical care available to you or loved ones (for ANY reason) twelve days from now.
28417,The death rate for Covid AND other serious illnesses will increase.
28418,"Americans will be dying at home, in waiting rooms, hallways etc., please if you can stay home."
28419,Try to get an even better mask for when you can't stay home (like a KN95) instead of cloth or loose surgical masks and do not allow your mask to make you feel invincible.
28420,Even if everyone is masking and distanced try your best to minimize the time spent sharing air with people outside your household.
28421,Many people are essential workers or for other reasons have no choice.
28422,That makes it doubly important for those of us who can stay home do so.

28502,Any program that doesn't meet NCLEX pass rate requirements for their graduates will quickly lose their accreditation.
28503,There are no online RN programs I'm aware of in the entire country and online NP programs require in-person clinical hours.
28504,You know it's a tough spot.
28505,Generally best not to give in to these people as it will just encourage more abuse of other health professionals in other states.
28506,But at some point you just have to step back and worry about your own family.
28507,States should step in and give them 24/7 security detail.

28536,"Nobody, even highly trained scientists executes all safety procedures 100% correctly 100% of the time."

28539,So back to us and to our situation.
28540,People are going to think they can all execute their safety situations perfectly and be protected.

28552,Her grandma ripped into the nurse for doing that and playing to her sister's kindness.
28553,Some of these medical workers need to be removed from the medical field because they certainly don't put health and safety first.
28554,"I will be first in line to get the vaccine, but it’s disingenuous to say that a few months of trials would show any longer term effects."
28555,Edit to add: it’s more accurate to say that because of the urgency of the pandemic we have to accept  time -limited efficacy and safety trials.
28556,"I will be first in line to get the vaccine, but it’s disingenuous to say that a few months of trials would show any longer term effects."

28581,"Yet, over past week or so they have been high on the list of people searching for tests."

28587,I guarantee the US will light up like never before if people searching for tests.
28588,"It’s not the level 1 spread - it’s those who get it during thanksgiving and spread it to X number of people, level 2, and then that continues to build."
28589,It will be on the news everywhere about the lines in countless states of people wanting to get tested.
28590,"Level 1 spread will bump the needle 7-15 days out, but it’s the level 2 folks who will really move the needle... as well as levels 3, 4, 5...."

Besides -

This vaccine will be produced in fairly low volumes initially and will be used almost exclusively for healthcare workers, first responders, and high risk patients."
28804,Auto workers do not fall into any of these categories and should not get any of the Pfizer vaccine until the general population is being vaccinated.
28805,The moderna vaccine can be stored in a regular freezer and will be available within a few weeks of the Pfizer vaccine.
28806,The Astra Zenica vaccine is a couple of months behind the moderna vaccine at most and can be stored in a refrigerator.

28848,This.
28849,They pushed HCQ as a cure.
28850,And the earliest a vaccine could be approved is Dec 10.
28851,"Mind you, that's simply approval."
28852,"Then comes the mess of logistics, distribution, storage, manufacturing, anti-vaxers, this administration, insurance."
28853,America is not known for its efficiency that is well known.
28854,Cant reason with the anti vax crowd  they are blinded by their hatred for Trump and imagine that he was in the lab cooking this vaccine up.
28855,They converted car manufacturing to produce N95 masks in a matter of weeks.
28856,9 months for a small amount of vaccine production isnt a big ask.
28857,And this is only the most recent failing.
28858,"Any side effects that you would see in a few months would already be known about by now, and certainly by the time the vaccine rolls around to you."

28860,Which are incredibly unlikely.
28861,Agreed 1000%.
28862,Two of the points you make are exactly why my uncle died of Covid today at a hospital in Madison.
28863,"1-When he got sick 2 weeks ago, there were no beds in Madison."
28864,He was sent to Edgerton’s hospital where he sat suffocating for 2 days because they didn’t have the capability to vent him.
28865,"By the time ICU space opened in Madison, he had no chance."
28866,"Bless them for trying, I guess."
28867,"2-He caught Covid from his wife, who caught it from her job in nursing, despite her using all the PPE her job provided."
28868,Fuck every single GOP.
28869,They let this happen and blocked all reasonable attempts to prevent it.
28870,"As only 10-15% of the population has been infected, total from the beginning, and the R0 is far into exponential, it will have a greater growth rate."
28871,"The idea that you can persuade people to do the right thing relies on everyone being a rational actor, which we know for a fact is not the case."
28872,It also doesn't make sense because the entire reason we have laws is because we know people don't always do the right thing.
28873,It's like why have the government tell you that drunk driving is wrong by making it a crime?
28874,Shouldn't we just persuade everyone to do the right thing and not drink and drive?
28875,"No, it has to be against the law because people drink and drive all the time even knowing that it's wrong and even knowing that it's illegal, and the consequences of doing nothing and letting everyone ""just make their own decisions"" are too great."
28876,"Wow dude, you're still trying to offer up a talking point that we all watched blown into obscure irrelevance in the spring."

28913,"You can argue that the other 7 million (2 million for ""occasional use"", 1 million occupied by someone who doesn't live there, 1 million for ""family/personal reasons"", half a million need repairs, half a million are foreclosed, half a million are being repaired, half a million used for storage, half a million extended absence, half a million in legal proceedings, etc)."
28914,But I'm not quite sure that it is that the issue.
28915,You can see how the monthly supply of houses is extremely low.

28950,"Similar laws exist in Georgia, North Carolina, and West Virginia."
28951,"In Louisiana and Minnesota, the laws make an exception for religious face coverings."
28952,Virginia’s provisions make an exception for medical reasons and if the governor declares an emergency exemption.
28953,"Does it matter, though?"
28954,Vaccines will help create immunity.
28955,"Ignoring the virus will (cause much needless suffering, but eventually) also lead to herd immunity."
28956,"Different paths, same destination."
28957,Most people don't understand how ventilation systems work on modern airliners and assume the cabin air is just constantly recycled.
28958,"In reality, the engine air intake continuously pulls in, heats, and compresses fresh air from outside to provide cabin pressurization and spent air is released from the plane constantly."

29043,"## ABSTRACT

The aim of this study was to describe the outcomes of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the outpatient setting after early treatment with zinc, low-dose hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin (triple therapy) dependent on risk stratification."
29044,This was a retrospective case series study in the general practice setting.
29045,A total of 141 COVID-19 patients with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the year 2020 were included.
29046,The main outcome measures were risk-stratified treatment decision and rates of hospitalisation and all-cause death.
29047,"A median of 4 days \[interquartile range (IQR) 3–6 days; available for *n* = 66/141 patients\] after the onset of symptoms, 141 patients (median age 58 years, IQR 40–67 years; 73.0% male) received a prescription for triple therapy for 5 days."
29048,Independent public reference data from 377 confirmed COVID-19 patients in the same community were used as untreated controls.
29049,"Of 141 treated patients, 4 (2.8%) were hospitalised, which was significantly fewer (*P* &lt; 0.001) compared with 58 (15.4%) of 377 untreated patients \[odds ratio (OR) = 0.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06–0.5\]."
29050,"One patient (0.7%) in the treatment group died versus 13 patients (3.4%) in the untreated group (OR = 0.2, 95% CI 0.03–1.5; *P* = 0.12)."
29051,No cardiac side effects were observed.
29052,"Risk stratification-based treatment of COVID-19 outpatients as early as possible after symptom onset using triple therapy, including the combination of zinc with low-dose hydroxychloroquine, was associated with significantly fewer hospitalisations."
29053,Yup just try not to get upset over things you can’t control
29054,Idk if the Polio vaccine is what I’d use for my comparison considering it’s not the 1950s.
29055,How about water pooling at the bottom and dripping fown your chin?
29056,I feel like changing the mask after only 20 minutes.
29057,Lol okay friend.

29060,Whose murdering brown folks?
29061,Why are these conversations in a subreddit about COVID?
29062,Im honestly confused...
29063,That’s basically what my kid’s pediatrician told me when I asked about the vaccine.
29064,"She said there aren’t any trials to approve it for kids, and there likely won’t be any time soon since the at risk groups are older people."
29065,They’re going to want to vaccinate pretty much every willing adult before moving to the pediatric population.
29066,So the state has months and months before it’s even an issue.
29067,"No, this is some gaslighting revisionism."
29068,"The original plan was 2 weeks to flatten the curve, 2 weeks to buy the hospitals time."
29069,How it turned into this nonsense is something that will be studied for decades.

29075,My buddy in Wisconsin just got covid from his sister’s wedding along with at least half a dozen other people.

29077,I'll never understand why you anti-maskers think you're better than anti-vaxers.
29078,"You're not, you're worse."
29079,Getting a vaccination has miniscule risk.
29080,Wearing a mask has no risk.
29081,1 person has died from measles because of anti-vaxers in the last 6 year in the US.

29109,I'm just playing devils advocate here.
29110,Also you have to factor in your chance of getting COVID in combination with the death rate to know your odds of dying from it.
29111,So 1/20 in the US x 1/500.

29137,4 people (in a different building) tested positive during our employee appreciation week.
29138,Out of maybe 100 people 25 went to get tested and everybody started wearing masks pretty much all the time.

29218,Cuts down the time you have the virus.
29219,Potentially stops you being infectious or at least shortens the time you are.
29220,If we have enough people vaccinated all of the above means the virus can’t spread unchecked and find new victims constantly.
29221,It slows down and then eliminates the spread because NO ONE has the virus eventually (in theory...in practice we have no idea with COVID).
29222,It's because individual people are generally not in a position to figure out medical information themselves.

29353,"We also teach people to swim, but motherfuckers can't be bothered to learn how to put a piece of fabric on their face."
29354,And death is NOT the only risk.
29355,Oh wait I know what to do.
29356,This technology has existed for a hundred years right?
29357,We can't really stamp it out anywhere when travel is allowed between counties and between states with different restrictions and adherence.
29358,There's just too much community spread.
29359,They used de say that about chronic fatigue syndrome/ME &amp; Fibromyalgia as well until they did extensive research.
29360,Telling someone that their very physical issues are mental without providing any research to back it up is just insulting.
29361,"This exact situation has happened a few times already too (a shooting and a stabbing and a beating I think)

I can only assume it’s the same type of guy that starts fights if anyone looks in the general direction of their ~~property~~ woman."

29368,"Sorry, why are you an expert in viral transmission?"
29369,You haven’t conducted studies focusing on mask efficiency in viral transmission?
29370,You aren’t a research scientist who can differentiate between hypotheses using test statistics?
29371,"For the same reason that we don’t let the engineers who designed the machines which make the masks for advice on how to wear them, we ask scientists to determine the impact on transmission 

The scientists concluded that surgical masks and cloth masks are better than nothing, so we wear them, but let’s not go misleading people"
29372,That's fine if it's a choice that isn't being forced onto others.
29373,"What you are displaying right here, right now, is the rational for all violence."
29374,Everyone thinks it's appropriate to the situation.
29375,Even these insane anti-mask morons.

29377,COVID is going to be breaking records all winter long.
29378,"Come on man...tailgating in the muni lot, during the winter, that's the kind of shit that builds character😂😂"
29379,Claiming something is a cure to the coronavirus is not illegal?
29380,You certainly cannot sell something with that claim.
29381,Yeah...theres risk both ways.
29382,Probably much more not getting a vaccine as covid is highly contagious.
29383,Vaccines can have consequences though too that are long term.
29384,It's likely rare.
29385,"And it will be unknown what these are, but when hundreds of millions of people take them...there will be some negative reactions."
29386,Heck if you give 300 million people a tictac and tell them it's a vaccine...some would likely report side effects.
29387,That's how placebos work too.
29388,I'd say I'll definately get a vaccine though.
29389,This needs to be over.
29390,How is it rushed?
29391,What corners were cut?
29392,If you make these claims back it up with actual evidence.
29393,Are you a scientist?
29394,Do you know ANYTHING about how vaccines are made?
29395,About the clinical review process?
29396,Or are you just talking out of your ass?
29397,"Uh, yeah."
29398,This virus very much discriminates by age.
29399,"&gt;We literally watched NYC burn down with the COVID in the Spring

29634,"So, we flew to Venice, spent 2 days there, took a cruise that stopped at a variety of ports in Italy, Croatia, Malta, and Montenegro and ended in Rome where we spent another 2 days."
29635,The ship basically acted as the transportation between the cities without having to pack/unpack every time we went somewhere new.
29636,We also spent a LOT of time figuring out what private tours to take in each city (not just what the cruise line offered) and had things lined up in each city (e.g.
29637,"private cars to take us places, etc.)."
29638,"People on Reddit are notoriously anti-cruise, but for us it was a great way to get around and still enable us to get a taste of what we wanted."

29650,"I am from Singapore, my country made masks mandatory since earlier this year."

29652,"Everyone did their part, we wore our masks, had proper social distancing, had proper control of crowds, we did it, I have not checked the news on covid numbers for my country for weeks because it's been almost 0 everyday, the only cases we get are from foreign visitors, which are subjected to 2 weeks of quarantine when they arrive."
29653,How we did it?
29654,"Well the government hired those who lost their jobs as enforcers, they would ensure that masks are worn at all times in public, they would ensure there will be no groups of more than 5, they would also give out fines for people who failed to do so."
29655,"Foreigners who chose to neglect our laws, are deported straight back and never allowed back in."

29659,28 deaths out of 58000+ confirmed cases.

29671,"An EUA is a lower standard, full stop, and does not require the “substantial evidence of safety and effectiveness” that a typical drug or vaccine approval would."
29672,It simply requires that it is reasonable to believe that it will be safe and effective.
29673,There is a difference.
29674,Source: work in regulatory.
29675,Guess what!
29676,"Danmarks Capital region also accounts for 55% of all deaths, but 30% of the population."
29677,But they didn’t have a holiday in week 9.
29678,So strange.
29679,I wonder if there’s anything else that distinguishes the capitals from the rest of their respective countries.
29680,What could it be?
29681,America is [Leon Lett at Superbowl 27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqG6lgYirf0).
29682,You're right.
29683,"We should've had a stern, strongly worded federal advisory two weeks ago, ya know, when people were actively making their travel plans, buying their turkeys, etc... No one that's planning to attend a big family dinner is going to cancel today, lol."
29684,Lame comment.
29685,This is yet another failure in messaging.
29686,"Fauci should be urging Americans to sacrifice traditional Thanksgiving to save **themselves** and not just ""lives""."
29687,Appeal to Americans' sense of self-preservation.
29688,Skip Thanksgiving to protect yourself.
29689,Skip Christmas to protect yourself.
29690,That is the message Americans will hear.
29691,It is as damaging.
29692,These are the people who have the authority to shut things down and set these types of restrictions.
29693,You can’t have it both ways.
29694,Should Trump have set an example with wearing a mask?
29695,"Absolutely, but these are the people shutting down businesses and ruining people’s livelihoods while they go off enjoying family and friends while telling everyone else to stay home."
29696,It’s bush league and all credibility is out the window.
29697,How is this curfew going to stop gathering at someone house?
29698,Haha this is hilarious.
29699,So you think countries like New Zealand can’t import anything because they shut their borders?
29700,Trade isn’t affected in those countries.
29701,"Please, learn the basics of international trade."
29702,Correct me where I’m wrong
29703,This is why I have a love/hate with reddit.
29704,I love it for the intelligent off shoots and arguments in completely unrelated threads.
29705,I hate it for all the idiocy at times.
29706,"If private gatherings are a problem, why shut down restaurants and gyms then?"
29707,"Because, as you said, 'wearing masks doesnt mean much'."
29708,"Everyone knows it, including you."
29709,"Masks do not provide any noticeable safety, and this is why the government locks things down, instead of letting people do their business in masks."
29710,Locking the business down is **the only way** to ensure the virus will not be transmitted via that business.
29711,No business = no transmission.
29712,Business = transmission.
29713,Masks or no masks.
29714,"So, 'If only 70% of people wore masks, the virus would be over' is a completely false statement."
29715,"Close to 100% of people do, virus still spreads, and actually this is why private gatherings of 7 households are illegal."
29716,"If masks worked, masked private gatherings would not have been a problem at all."
29717,"According to the [news conference](https://www.msn.com/ja-jp/news/national/%E5%8C%BB%E7%99%82-%E5%B4%A9%E5%A3%8A%E3%81%AE%E5%8D%B1%E6%A9%9F-%E6%BA%80%E5%BA%8A%E7%B6%9A%E3%81%8D%E3%82%B9%E3%82%BF%E3%83%83%E3%83%95%E7%96%B2%E5%BC%8A/ar-BB1blFbQ) and [NHK](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20201125/k10012730581000.html), my understanding is that  the occupancy rate for hospital beds for coronavirus patients exceeded 25 percent of the ***total beds available*** in Tokyo and several prefectures."
29718,"Under this situation,  ""医療スタッフが不足しており、受け入れ可能病床は満床の状況だ"" which means ""shortage of medical staff and the situation that all the beds are occupied""."
29719,"It doesn't mean  ""75% capacity is still not utilized in the worst-hit areas""."
29720,The rest of 75% capacity is used by non-Covid patients.
29721,"what is this, March again?"
29722,"&gt; There haven't been any reports about people with holiday in week 9 were more likely to return home infected than people with holiday in week 8 

There is a pre-print available that seem to support that sentiment:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; The winter holiday was held in week 9 in 38 regions constituting one fifth of the study population, and was in these regions estimated to explain 38% of the excess mortality

29729,Willful ignorance should make you ineligible for rationed care.
29730,I think companies are being more responsible.
29731,I haven't noticed ads for door busters or giveaways or whatever like in previous years.
29732,I think they know it would look EXTREMELY bad if they did that.
29733,You have my upvote good lady or sir
29734,Because minimizing gathering is more effective than wearing a cloth mask
29735,The sad thing is it’ll never happen because hospital execs only care about profits and there is no money to be made treating covid patients.
29736,Fucking Florida.
29737,Almost as many deaths as California.
29738,California has TWICE the population.
29739,"I finally figured out why she is SD governor , she won the South Dakota snow queen title and had 26 traffic violations ."

29743,Home is where your heart is.
29744,Daughter and Wife flew to Mars so he absolutely need to fly to Mars too to be near home.
29745,/S   Funny how these public figures get caught over and over again worldwide.
29746,"Oh they'll definitely sacrifice, they'll sacrifice their overweight diabetic Nan at the dinner table, but ask them to just *sit and chill at home* for one holiday is way too much to ask."
29747,Yeah the hospital ceiling and lighting.
29748,"The railing for the curtains....

No stranger to that view."
29749,I hate that view
29750,Fair.
29751,"There is definitely a lot of gray area when considering what is ""necessary"", but there are certainly measures that can be taken."
29752,"That's basically what laws are, just social contracts."
29753,Murder is illegal because it would be detrimental to society if it went unchecked.
29754,"That's definitely a different case than vaccines, but still."
29755,"I should also mention that these are my general thoughts, off the cuff."
29756,This is not an issue that I've thought deeply on to flush out all of my thoughts and reasoning.
29757,"While I agree with you in 99.9% of a cases, this one is not one."
29758,"I agree that fear mongering is detrimental to the public consciousness (as seen pre-COVID with the 24 hour news cycle) and can create it's own problems, but under this specific case (an airborne contagion that spreads exponentially) I think ironically it would have helped more than what actually happened (being downplayed)."
29759,"It’s the fact that there are many professions that aren’t “essential” but are forced to be out there in the public, putting them at risk."
29760,"It’s not fair that many can’t stay home, but aren’t considered essential and will have to wait much longer to get a vaccine."
29761,"Let's be honest, it's the DIShonesty like this that has destroyed public trust."
29762,It's the same reason that was given for why officials told people masks didn't work early on.
29763,It had nothing to do with health.
29764,"In fact, it was UNhealthy advice and helped foster an anti-mask movement that is currently hampering efforts to combat the virus."
29765,Why?
29766,Because they didn't want pope buying masks when there wasn't enough for health care workers.
29767,This is manipulation.
29768,It's cashing in trust that you don't get back.
29769,"When all of this is over, trust will be in the toilets and any future calamity is going to be magnified by a lack of trust between the people and public officials."
29770,"This episode should have laid bare for many thinking people just how disconnected our interests are from those in charge, even in times of crisis."
29771,Uncle of Mrs. Krabapple?
29772,You sure are committed to posting those numbers everywhere every day.
29773,Do they know who in their family is responsible for infecting them all?
29774,I think some people also think they are being careful and won't admit to themselves that they're not.
29775,"They may think they are being careful because they aren't traveling, but 10 family members from five households who live within an hour of each other get together."
29776,Cyberpunk delay incoming?
29777,Fuck them and nevermind that some vaccines only show side effects months/years after they are introduced.
29778,Nevermind that the recovery rate is within a decimal point of 100% your fear dominates their rights!
29779,Wha?
29780,"In Michigan they're telling us to go black friday shopping, not stay home!"
29781,Will they also be on the hook for any potential side effects (very unlikely but who knows when you vaccine 300m people)?
29782,"If so, I doubt they will."
29783,"Thanks, McConnell!"
29784,Useless imp.
29785,"Cue people working from home screaming ""it's not fair!""."
29786,Because they want to go to bars again.
29787,&gt;there’s always a chance Biden keeps around I guess.
29788,"Non-zero chance they will, that's exactly the kind of radical centrism he deals in."
29789,I am not going to lie I would love to see a military style lock down that would arrest anti-maskers and curfew violators.
29790,Let the people who are endangering the lives of others rot and die from covid in jail.
29791,The guy that was caught with a little bit of weed doesn't deserve to die in a jail cell from covid.
29792,these people do.
29793,At what point did I say I won’t get a vaccine.
29794,I said two things.
29795,I’m not in a rush to get the first wave of vaccines.
29796,"Secondly, I’m not having an employer/corporation whatever telling me what I have to do when it comes to shit like this."
29797,Show me otherwise.
29798,only half are **supporters**.
29799,everyone is a follower.

29804,Yeah this is great.
29805,Thanks for the perspective!
29806,It’s so sad to see that unfortunately these brave journalists won’t be the first to get it... we really need to vaccinate everyone as soon as we can!
29807,I’m so happy that Bill Gates is really stepping up and being outspoken for the proven benefits of vaccination.
29808,"However even with the majority of the population vaccinated, the reality is we will still need to practice social distancing and mask wearing."
29809,This is why the government regulates dangerous things.
29810,It's to protect the mouth breathers from themselves.
29811,*northern Slovakia has slinked out of the chat*
29812,I hope not.
29813,"There are people who actually make contributions to the material well being of this country, and the media do not count."
29814,Their skills are just too fungible to have any value.
29815,Florida shuts things down?
29816,I genuinely don't know how I encouraged people to do that.
29817,"If you have a specific comment of mine in mind, respond to that, and we'll have a discussion."
29818,"If you just follow people around and post vague associations about things they have said elsewhere, without responding to what they say now, that is not criticism."
29819,That is just trolling.
29820,"You do realize that if someone really is posting something that should be criticized, and then posting something else that might be reasonable, and you go and respond to the reasonable with weird unexplained accusations, you come out looking like the crazy person and just legitimizing the person?"
29821,You should get one.
29822,They are pretty cool animals.

29824,This app has been a nothing burger.
29825,"I downloaded it, eventually tested positive for covid but was never assigned a 6 digit code so no one with app and bluetooth will be notified of proximity."
29826,I even called to request the code twice to no avail...open bluetooth has some security risk so why bother?
29827,"&gt; -we severely undertest and still have a lot of confirmed cases per capita, reality is at least 5x, likely more."
29828,The epidemiologist say that reported cases should be multiplied 3 to 10 times for all countries to get more realistic figures.
29829,The government is playing politics with the pandemic.
29830,They made a show of hiring the largest plane in the world to bring in masks from China that turned out to be useless.
29831,Same for respirators.
29832,"During summer they were too busy infighting, campaigning for presidential elections and passing controversial laws to get prepared for the expected surge in the fall."
29833,Now they haphazardly convert public indoor spaces into field hospitals but they don't accept very sick patients to them.
29834,In the meantime intensive care beds are full and ambulances have to wait or drive for hours to find a place in a hospital for their patient.
29835,"Poland is going through what northern Italy, NYC area, Spain, Brazil, and many other countries or areas went through."

29845,TLDR: author talks about the hypocrisy of local rules that claim it is ok to do some things but not others when they have the same if not higher risk.
29846,It causes confusion and unnecessary risk.
29847,"It'll be politicians, their doners and celebrities before the elderly."
29848,I know.
29849,To tell you the truth I don;t believe all the numbers we see as purposeful efforts been made in many states to keep the reported numbers down.
29850,"No matter what, the worse to come is going to be so much worse than it should have been"
29851,"I didn't say anything about the US, other countries' employers will require vaccine as well, but great luck with your backwoods vaccine ignorance in whatever country you're in!"
29852,Covid and bigotrym Those two are our biggest problems currently.
29853,And neo-nazis.
29854,"Everything, but its easy to justify that I'm safe I followed distancing and was tested."
29855,"&amp;#x200B;

Its as dumb as sharing a needle that you cleaned with a lighter."
29856,"You justify it by saying we have both tested negative for HIV/hep in the last week, but then ignore the fact you've been fucking around with other people for days."
29857,What?
29858,They're both exponential.
29859,The base is defined in one case and the exponent is defined in the other.
29860,"To apply it to the virus, the base would be how many people one person infects per day, and the exponent would be how many days it's been going."
29861,"So, x^(10) would be 10 days out with an unknown infection rate."
29862,And 10^(x) would mean that one person infects 10.
29863,Absurd.
29864,It sounds like their plan is to replace the staff with travel nurses and somehow that saves money?
29865,That makes sense..  somehow.
29866,We’re too far gone as a nation.
29867,A majority accepts that this virus should be taken seriously while a vocal minority doesn’t even think it’s real and that any sort of mitigation is oppression.
29868,This minority also the ones who would go so far to discredit any raw footage as fake and anyone in them actors.
29869,"They are so delusional that [even when they have Covid, they don’t think it’s Covid,](https://youtu.be/IBtPHCpIRWU) so any on death’s door 180s are out of the picture."
29870,"This is why no matter what we do, it will continue to be a challenge until the vaccine will literally save us from them and Covid."
29871,“ seem” to.
29872,"Meanwhile, my dog just lies there, on the couch, not giving a shit."
29873,Stay safe and be well!
29874,They can't because it's horseshit.
29875,"For one, natural infection seems to produce an immune response at least that long for 80-90% of people."
29876,"Secondly, vaccines typically produce a larger immune response than natural infection."
29877,"Most vaccine makers have said while they don't have all data yet, they expect it to protect for at least a year, but it is still a bit of an unknown for now."
29878,Its almost as if you shouldn't be travelling
29879,"They’re assuming only people who were very irresponsible and partied, took their masks off, didn’t practice good hygiene, etc, got sick."
29880,"Which isn’t true, there are people who did everything “right” and still got sick."
29881,Hipaa?
29882,"Hey, don't say neverm We have pretty nice places and only half the people are delusional followers of the supreme leader."
29883,I think you could lighten up on your distancing.
29884,You can go see people if you want.
29885,Maybe not Thanksgiving but do it later.
29886,Do you have the ability to drive?
29887,"Nah, he seems like he was an ok guy."
29888,But what folks do in his name?
29889,"Now, that's a different story..."
29890,People are attacking Fox News for reporting... the news.
29891,You realize the Pope literally can't be anti-Catholic right?
29892,Catholic dogma gives the pope infallibility and supremecy.
29893,He has the authority to decide what are considered formal beliefs of the Catholic church.
29894,"If you think that the POPE is anti-Catholic, this would be a good time for you to actually crack open the Bible and read about Jesus."
29895,Because this Pope is FAR closer to what Jesus teaches than you obviously understand.
29896,....this is very scary.

29902,I'm sorry you're going to be alone.
29903,Vaccine is here and people arguing about taking it.
29904,I saw this coming a mile away...Fucked up world we live in.
29905,Orange tans and golf were the priority.
29906,I don't think it's cool to nuke cities full of civilians.
29907,So I'd say pretty misguided.
29908,I could think of a few reasons as of late to not visit Poland lol.
29909,"If you've at all paid attention the the articles on here, you workshop be asking."
29910,Vaccines will go to health care workers and the highest risk groups first.
29911,"Also, getting vaccinated with these vaccines only means people don't get symptoms, but can still get infected / be carriers."
29912,"So if you think you'll get a shot and throw that mask away the next day, you're wrong."
29913,"If a stimulus is passed it will be just like last time, a handout to the rich while both sides blame the other side for voting for it."

29942,I’m tired of doing the right thing.
29943,I’m tired of being stuck inside and doing nothing .
29944,I’m tired of watching other people have no regard for anyone else.
29945,I’m just tired.
29946,Tired and alone during the holidays because selfish people live selfish lives.
29947,This thing somehow turned so political and spiraled out of control.
29948,I hate it.
29949,Yes.
29950,"Adapt, migrate, or die."
29951,Those are the options.
29952,I'm profoundly grateful for the altruism that led most nurses to the field.
29953,I honor their work and have for decades.
29954,"Hell, my mother was an RN and later became a public health nurse."
29955,"But at some point you have to stand up and say, ""I am no longer accepting this kind of mistreatment,"" or you have to accept that you ARE, in fact, accepting mistreatment."
29956,"It's a fucking shame, truly a global embarrassment, how we Americans are treating ourselves, our neighbors, and the people who've dedicated themselves to our support."
29957,"But it's also eminently clear who we are: entitled brats and crybabies, totally unwilling to accept even a shred of responsibility for our impacts on others."
29958,"If nurses and others are (rightfully) tired of cleaning up the mess we're making, they should stop."

29972,You see she has been in the hospital for days fighting some weird scary rare auto immune disease.
29973,"If I get the opportunity to have her come home where she has been livivg with me for years, it will now make the holidays special again."
29974,We need to look at Thanksgiving with the light that we are healthy and safe.
29975,That those we love are healthy and safe.
29976,I was bummed about Thanksgiving with no family or friends.
29977,Now all I want is my little lockdown family group back together and safe.

30006,The equilibrium is a set of measures that keeps the R value just below 1 so the virus can't grow over time.
30007,"But they need to be put in place *immediately* when there is *any* virus in sight since any delay just means that the infection has time to grow before the exact same measures have to be taken anyway, perhaps after a strict lockdown to get it under control."
30008,I'm in Italy and the current measures seem to be sufficient and the infection rate has started going down again.

30030,"While the official stats show that covid related deaths are \~650 (and there are many cases where non-covid case is reported as covid, because hospitals get more money per covid case, e.g."
30031,death by falling from a ladder -&gt; covid).
30032,The rest might be e.g.
30033,"because people didn't get a procedure because hospitals are mostly covid-only, so if you get a heart attach or have cancer - sorry, you might not get a bed."

30069,Again: 25% is the occupancy rate.
30070,That means 75% capacity is still not utilized in the worst-hit areas.
30071,Japan isn't failing.
30072,This is Japan taking the virus seriously.
30073,That's why they are already sounding all the alarm bells despite low actual hospitalization rates.

30229,"&gt;Life expectancy in Sweden will most likely fall this year, according to a new forecast from Statistics Sweden."
30230,There are large differences between the regions.
30231,Life expectancy is estimated to decline most in Stockholm County.
30232,"&gt;  
&gt;In 2020, the number of deaths from COVID-19 has led mortality rates to deviate more than usual on a year-to-year basis."
30233,"Therefore, Statistics Sweden has produced a report for the purpose of estimating average life expectancy in Sweden in 2020."
30234,The forecast is based on the number of deaths in the period from January to August.
30235,"&gt;  
&gt;“In addition to the observed mortality rates, our main forecast applied the same mortality rates for October to December as in 2019."
30236,"However, depending on what assumptions are made for the remaining months of the year, life expectancy may be higher or lower than that,” says Örjan Hemström, demographer at Statistics Sweden."
30237,"&gt;  
&gt;Developments in the mortality rates between January and August indicate a declining life expectancy for both women and men this year; **from 84.7 years to 84.4 years for women and from 81.3 years to 80.8 years for men."
30238,"**  
&gt;  
&gt;“For men, this means, roughly speaking, that the large increase in life expectancy in 2019 will be erased and will return to the 2018 level."
30239,"For women, the decline is somewhat smaller."
30240,"This may be the overall largest decline on an annual basis since 1944,” Örjan Hemström points out."
30241,"&gt;  
&gt;Life expectancy has increased steadily in Sweden in the period 1900-2019, so a decrease stands out."
30242,"&gt;  
&gt;“There have been some years and shorter periods of stagnation or reduced life expectancy."
30243,"However, it is still unusual for life expectancy to drop from one year to the next.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Additional calculations  
&gt;  
&gt;The report also includes alternative estimations of life expectancy at national level for 2020."
30244,These are based on estimates of possible effects of a second wave of COVID-19 infections and on an assumption of lower mortality rates in the autumn than in 2019.
30245,"&gt;  
&gt;“However, the current increased spread of COVID-19 may well mean more extra deaths in the final two months of the year, which may lead to an even lower average life expectancy in 2020”, says Örjan Hemström."
30246,"&gt;  
&gt;Between 1 January and 31 August, there were nearly 6 500 more deaths than in the same period in 2019, which is **4 800 more deaths than expected** based on the latest population projection for 2020."
30247,"&gt;  
&gt;“Such a long period of elevated mortality will mostly likely lead to decreased life expectancy."
30248,"Most extra deaths compared with a year ago occurred in the higher ages, although it appears that mortality rates may be higher in 2020 than in 2019 in all age groups,” Örjan Hemström reflects."
30249,"&gt;  
&gt;Life expectancy increased by around half a year for both women and men in 2019 compared with 2018, from 84.3 years to 84.7 years and from 80.8 years to 81.3 years respectively."
30250,"&gt;  
&gt;“Increases this large are rare."
30251,"The differences between 2018 and 2019 were largely due to lower mortality rates in the ages over 64 years.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Differences between counties  
&gt;  
&gt;Mortality rates in the first eight months of 2020 indicate that life expectancy may decline in many counties, but not in all of them."
30252,"It appears that in Västerbotten County, life expectancy may increase compared with 2019."
30253,"In Stockholm County, life expectancy is estimated to decline by 1.2 years, from 83.7 years to 82.5 years."
30254,"Declines of 0.6-0.7 years, which is larger than the national level, are also expected in the counties of Södermanland, Jönköping, and Uppsala."
30255,"&gt;  
&gt;Facts: The forecast  
&gt;  
&gt;The estimation of mortality rates for the last four months of 2020 is based on the number of deaths in the same period the previous year."
30256,The population on 30 June 2020 for women and for men in each individual age is used for the calculation of the number of deaths for the full year 2020.
30257,The number of deaths per sex and age in the first eight months of 2020 is compared with the number of deaths in the same period in 2019.
30258,"&gt;  
&gt;In alternative estimations of life expectancy, one assumption of lower mortality rates is used and one assumption of higher mortality rates at the end of 2020 compared with 2019."
30259,"To imply anything, you literally have to have an intention to do so...

30265,"You clapped back with:

&gt; That doesnt not make them an outlier and i didnt say they didnt."
30266,"Right there was your first assumption, when you assumed somehow that I accused you of calling anything an outlier, to which I obviously confused replied to with:

&gt; Neither did I?"
30267,"And then you went on a several comment long grammar lesson about how my usage of three dots made you assume once again that I meant one of these two things:

1."

2."

30342,This article was pretty eye opening.
30343,On top of that this probably isn't even the first time; I'd guess many of these people already have sacrificed holiday gatherings before in their lives.

30365,You made an assumption based on those anecdotes not specifically mentioning testing.
30366,Nothing in this article is misleading that I see.
30367,There's a lot more danger inherent in downplaying a deadly disease than in warning people of potential serious complications.
30368,Acknowledging that there's a possibility of lingering severe complications is not the same as running around screaming that everyone is going to die.

30377,The schools here have gone against the dept of health guidelines and decided we'll just keep schools open because kids aren't getting sick.

I'm in Spain atm and a doctor just told me what we all know: intensive care units are mostly full of old fat people (not that they deserve to die: don't misread me)."

If you take a young, healthy, fit person I think 99.7% is pessimistic."
30721,"It's probably more like 99.99%

BTW at the moment the plan in Spain, at least that's what the doctor told me, was to give the vaccine to 75+ years old and to people with known prior health condition."
30722,"&amp;#x200B;

It is not unthinkable that the strategy to fight this virus in several countries might be to give the vaccine (which France, for example, wouldn't be mandatory) to the persons at risk only and try to reach heard immunity by precisely NOT giving the vaccine to those not at risk."
30723,"&amp;#x200B;

30751,also don't forget that medicine and science advances incredibly fast.
30752,Just because it took four years to develop the polio vaccine in the 50s doesn't mean it should take that long in 2020.

30769,You just said it yourself extended contact in small gatherings.
30770,Same goes for restaurants.
30771,You also completely ignore where I say the government should be paying people to stay home and closing shit up not just finger wagging at people who hang out with a few friends.
30772,It needs to be all or nothing as we see in New Zealand and Australia otherwise half measures don't work.
30773,Japan and 1945 in one headline is not a good sign.

30787,"The point that a lot of people seem to miss is that we began wearing masks not to protect ourselves, but to protect the high risk."
30788,"So that if we are infected, we don't spread it."
30789,Same with cleaning hands.
30790,"It's not 100% about not infecting ourselves if we touch a surface with live virus, but about not moving that live virus around to other surfaces as well."
30791,"The masks do offer some protection to the wearer, but overall, it's about keeping the things the wearer breathes out with the wearer."
30792,"I have managed to get a few people to understand that, but it takes repetition, calm, and a lot of ""I"" statements."
30793,"""You are selfish"" is not going to get you anywhere, but ""I wear a mask because I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I infected someone old or weak and they died"" seems to go a lot further."

30802,It's a clusterfuck for a few reasons:.
30803,"-we severely undertest and still have a lot of confirmed cases per capita, reality is at least 5x, likely more."
30804,"-Covid deniers and other conspiracy theorists have big following, I am sure if even 50% of the population is willing to be vaccinated, that includes many nurses and doctors."
30805,-People ignore restrictions.
30806,There many reasons but I think the main one is the population getting more and more desperate economically while being tired from the first wave of restrictions early this year where the government massively overshoot.
30807,"-introducing more measures would be both very unpopular and tragic when it comes to economic, social and health effects."
30808,"It's already bad, it's hard to get treatment for anything else than Covid."
30809,The overwhelming sentiment is that we should power through and accept the dead toll.
30810,I think it's the correct strategy.
30811,The main problem is that even if Western countries bail us out by providing working vaccine big part of the population is not willing to accept it.
30812,There's a cure for that now.
30813," No, it's the biochemical reality that cooler temperatures cause the upper respiratory epithelials to activate features of many viruses to make them more infective."
30814,Funny how this is the only vaccine even considered to be mandatory.
30815,I was just thinking about how glad I am that my wife and I are on the same page with covid.

30868,If you report to the initial study where these effects are watched in great detail - that's what the phase 3 is about - it appears it only affects a small fraction of participants with very mild symptoms.
30869,"For my part, everybody I know with COVID do not have mild symptoms, me for a start."

30976,"lol Also, please read this from Dr. Gerald Evans at the end of the article:

&gt;When it comes to studying the presentation of long-term symptoms, Dr. Gerald Evans, chair of the division of infectious diseases at Queen’s University and Kingston Health Sciences Centre, said **it’ll be important to distinguish between those who’ve been truly infected with COVID-19 and those for whom there’s no evidence they’ve ever had the virus."
30977,"**

&gt;For people who haven’t received an official coronavirus diagnosis but are observing long-term effects, Stevens said **they should get a serological test, which measures antibodies in the bloodstream that are associated with SARS-CoV-2."
30978,"**

&gt;“It becomes tricky because a lot of the symptoms that people are reporting are not terribly specific — things like trouble concentrating, headache, brain fog,” he said."
30979,"**“These can be symptoms of a number of other things as well.”**

I think it's honestly just fearmongering."

30985,"CEO is saying we won't open back up until 2021, no date specified yet, and anyone can continue working from home even after that point."
30986,Top execs were prepared to take pay cuts and made other contingency plans so that layoffs would be a measure of last resort.
30987,We were allowed special CTO for COVID-related sick days.

30994,"I find people have really unrealistic views of what ""welfare"" is like unless you have seen it up close."
30995,"I seriously doubt that they will make much in the way of long-term increases to assistance programs (Democrats have resisted doing that since Reagan because of public opinion against assistance programs), but they will at least hopefully staunch the flow of cuts to existing programs and hopefully institute some kind of additional temporary stimulus due to COVID."
30996,Sane first-world countries are replacing 80% of people's salaries or giving people a certain amount of money every month.
30997,"We probably won't go that far, but we need to do -something- more than what we are doing right now."
30998,"&gt; Geez, how hard is it to check CDC Stats?"
30999,"The stats you listed aren't for Covid, so I'm unsure why you quoted them or think they are valid."

31005,It's disingenuous.
31006,They should compare states to European countries.
31007,Arguably states with similar population densities.
31008,It's really interesting to me how the surprisingly good vaccine news has had such a complex and relatively muted effect on people's behaviors.
31009,"In theory, the great vaccine news should provide fuel for governments to go even harder against the virus but if anything, it's been the complete opposite."
31010,H7N9 has already infected people.
31011,5 separate outbreaks between 2013-2017.
31012,"It appears to be one of those viruses that kills its host too quickly to allow it to effectively spread very far, so it could  only have outbreaks and not full on  pandemics."
31013,Lol as if others in Europe are not going to do the same.

It's not."
31221,"In the restaurants where I've been doing security, people aren't allowed in without a mask, parties/tables are all at least 6 feet apart, parties are limited to 6 people, and people must remain seated unless they're going to the bathroom, at which point they must be wearing a mask."

31240,"The most important takeaways from the article in my opinion:

&gt; According to state health department reports, the largest sources of coronavirus infections are workplaces like meatpacking plants and warehouses, institutional settings like prisons and retirement communities, and businesses like restaurants and bars."
31241,"#

&gt; Small gatherings definitely do have some risk, the more infection there is in your community, the riskier those small gatherings are going to be."
31242,"&gt; People let down their guard and they aren't wearing their masks and they're indoors in high-risk settings, but it doesn't seem like there's any clear evidence that those are what are particularly driving the infection

#

&gt; Outdoor gatherings, especially ones that are really outdoors in the fresh air and people have space to spread out, that is the lowest risk possible situation."
31243,And that should really be the last thing that we're putting regulation in place to stop.
31244,"...

&gt; A lot of governments in the summer were closing beaches and closing parks, and those are actually where we should be encouraging people to go instead of restaurants and stores and things like that."

&gt; What about curfews?"
31246,"I've spoken with a lot of other epidemiologists and public health specialists, and we're not really sure at all where the justification in terms of the science for these curfews is."
31247,&gt; I think that the assumption from leaders that are placing these curfews in effect is that some people will decrease their planned activities because of the curfew.
31248,...
31249,The concern that a lot of the epidemiologists I've spoken with have is that people will instead just move their activities earlier and that will make more people concentrated in a smaller time window and that would be worse.

31256,"The review noted: 
&gt;Medical or surgical masks: Seven studies took place in the community, and two studies in healthcare workers."
31257,"Compared with wearing no mask, wearing a mask may make **little to no difference** in how many people caught a flu-like illness (9 studies; 3507 people); and probably makes **no difference** in how many people have flu confirmed by a laboratory test (6 studies; 3005 people)."
31258,"Unwanted effects were rarely reported, but included discomfort."
31259,"N95/P2 respirators: Four studies were in healthcare workers, and one small study was in the community."
31260,"Compared with wearing medical or surgical masks, wearing N95/P2 respirators probably makes **little to no difference** in how many people have confirmed flu (5 studies; 8407 people); and may make **little to no difference** in how many people catch a flu-like illness (5 studies; 8407 people) or respiratory illness (3 studies; 7799 people)."
31261,Unwanted effects were not well reported; discomfort was mentioned.
31262,"- On **18 November** 2020, *Annals of Internal Medicine* published *Effectiveness of Adding a Mask Recommendation to Other Public Health Measures to Prevent SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Danish Mask Wearers."
31263,"A Randomized Controlled Trial*, [(Bundgaard et al., 2020)](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-6817)."
31264,"This is the first and only RCT we have on mask effectiveness against COVID-19 in community settings, but its findings of ineffectiveness are fully expected in light of all the other RCTs we have on other respiratory viruses."
31265,"The results of the study: 
&gt;A total of 3030 participants were randomly assigned to the recommendation to wear masks, and 2994 were assigned to control; 4862 completed the study."
31266,Infection with SARS-CoV-2 occurred in 42 participants recommended masks (1.8%) and 53 control participants (2.1%).
31267,"The between-group difference was −0.3 percentage point (95% CI, −1.2 to 0.4 percentage point; P = 0.38) (odds ratio, 0.82 [CI, 0.54 to 1.23]; P = 0.33)."
31268,Multiple imputation accounting for loss to follow-up yielded similar results.
31269,"**Although the difference observed was not statistically significant, the 95% CIs are compatible with a 46% reduction to a 23% increase in infection**."
31270,"- On **17 November** 2020, *International Journal of Infectious Diseases* published *Meta-analysis on facemask use in community settings to prevent respiratory infection transmission shows no effect*, [(Gómez-Ochoa &amp; Muka, 2020)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220324504)."
31271,"The authors noted: 
&gt;there were no significant differences between medical facemasks use only and controls in the odds of developing laboratory-confirmed influenza and influenza-like illness."
31272,"Similarly, no differences in laboratory-confirmed influenza risk were observed when comparing mask use solely versus combined intervention of face mask and handwashing, indicating that facemask as solely intervention in community is not associated with reducing respiratory infection."
31273,"Given the studies used medical masks, cloth masks' efficacy is expected to be even lower; a randomized cluster trial showed that respiratory infection is higher among health care personnel using cloth masks than using medical masks (MacIntyre et al., 2015)...Due to these divergent results and the lack of high-quality research in this area, strong recommendations for facemask use in the community context should be issued with caution until new evidence is available to show their effectiveness."
31274,"This is even more important, considering that several studies showed that mask use is associated with headache incidence and worsening of pre-existing headache (Lim et al., 2006, Rebmann et al., 2013, Szeinuk et al., 2000, Radonovich, 2009, Shenal et al., 2011)."

31276,"The authors noted the serious methodological limitations of the more recent studies and concluded: 
&gt;The strength of evidence for mask use and risk for SARS-CoV-2 in *community settings* remained insufficient...Evidence for mask use versus nonuse and comparing masks types in *health care settings* remained insufficient...There were no new studies on the effectiveness and safety of mask reuse or extended use."
31277,"- On **25 September** 2020, the academic journal *Frontiers in Medicine* published *Effectiveness of Surgical Face Masks in Reducing Acute Respiratory Infections in Non-Healthcare Settings: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis*, by [(Wang et al., 2020)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmed.2020.564280/full)."
31278,"The review failed to find a statistically significant effect and concluded:

31280,"The authors noted:

31332,Or am I wrong somewhere?

31361,It should be noted that is current market rate for a traveling nurse.
31362,A nurse that has been working at the same job since day one of the pandemic is getting paid pennies on the dollar of that.
31363,In fact I remember reading an article recently about some nurses striking since their hospital wouldn't even authorize a pay increase during the pandemic ($6/hour raise if I remember right).
31364,But the population doesn’t normally need more medical care...or at least not more hospitalization.
31365,Medical advancement mean shorter hospital stays.
31366,The time for a hip surgery is far less than it was years ago.
31367,Conditions that once required hospitalizations can be treated outpatient safer.
31368,This is true for most hospitalizations.
31369,"The hospital is not a safe place and we try to keep people out, or in for shorter whenever possible."
31370,"You can say the issue is administration (and yes, there are some bad administrators who need to get a new career), but how do you think a hospital can afford to pay for staff and equipment that is only typically needed a few weeks/months of the year?"
31371,Should they increase overall costs so they can cover salaries?
31372,Or should they lay people off for more than half the year?
31373,It would be like maintaining a retail store and staff for Black Friday year round.
31374,It’s not sustainable.
31375,"Last time I went to Australia I had to show proof of vaccination for yellow fever, so this is not unprecedented, and tjry are right to do so."

31382,What's wrong with calling it a herd immunity strategy if the goal is herd immunity (through infection)?
31383,"In a typical S(E)IR model, R is a function of R0 and the number of people recovered and thus immune."
31384,It's not a function of anything else.
31385,"This means that seasonality, variation in population density, or anything else that affects transmission must be modeled as variation in R0."
31386,"You could set the model up with an additional variable for that, but that's not what people typically do."
31387,"If you need a reference:

&gt; Any factor having the potential to influence the contact rate, including population density (e.g., rural vs. urban), social organization (e.g., integrated vs. segregated), and seasonality (e.g., wet vs. rainy season for vectorborne infections), will ultimately affect R0."
