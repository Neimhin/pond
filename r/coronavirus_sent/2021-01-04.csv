these days we could at least require testing before and after flights to catch some of the infected people  instead of just testing those coming from the UK."

155,[removed]
156,Yeah I know.
157,I edited that in.
158,But the part I wanted to point out was the latter part.
159,"It‚Äôs just just the flu,  but now that we can actually quantify *how much worse* it is, we see why people are more accepting of the risk."
160,Saying *its just the flu* is statistically incorrect.
161,"Saying *its worse than the flu, but still not very high risk for me as a 30 year old* isn‚Äôt."
162,Most of these treatments are in the general population.
163,It‚Äôs not a cure all.
164,It doesn‚Äôt mean it saves everybody.
165,"You can get all potential treatments and still die, gasping for air."
166,"You‚Äôre also ignoring the fact that when hospitals are overloaded, they not only lack the supply to give everyone these treatments, they lack the staff to do so."
167,Which is a large part of the issue happening right now.
168,"the question stands, but the answer is obvious."
169,there's a huge difference between wishing the world had less people and wishing that the existing people on earth suffered in ways they could never imagine.

181,I honestly did not expect him to survive.
182,"Glad he is (probably) going to, though."
183,"&gt; It‚Äôs exclusively due to the greed of the CEO and board

Too busy skiing!"
184,I think the point is that if there are extra doses in the vials it may be hard to assure they have matching extra doses in the second round vials.
185,If each vial was counted as 5 does but then they get 7 out of it they need a corresponding vial with 7 doses for the second round.
186,This could be a legitimate issue if we find out that some facilities are more consistently producing 7 dose vials while another is consistently producing 5 or 6.
187,If wyoming gets all 7 dose vials the first round but then their second round shipments average 6 they may be in a tight spot.
188,I am not exactly sure what to think about the second wave.
189,"The first one hit most of the countries hard, but for the second one we haven't seen the same deaths levels (¬øyet?)."
190,"The first and second wave can't be compared only on cases, because the tests around the world were much lower ([https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/full-list-daily-covid-19-tests-per-thousand?time=2020-02-18..latest&amp;country=ITA\~USA\~GBR\~CHL](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/full-list-daily-covid-19-tests-per-thousand?time=2020-02-18..latest&amp;country=ITA~USA~GBR~CHL))."
191,"On the other hand, the positivity is rising in a lot of countries ([https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/covid19-positive-rate-since-5th-death?time=2020-02-23..latest&amp;country=GBR\~USA\~ESP\~ITA](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/covid19-positive-rate-since-5th-death?time=2020-02-23..latest&amp;country=GBR~USA~ESP~ITA))."
192,These projections are always way higher than reality.
193,"Seriously, someone save this comment."
194,If we hit 500k deaths by Feb 4 I will give you a free month to my OnlyFans.
195,This sounds eerily like what happened during the Spanish flu.
196,The first wave killed off the old folks and then the mutated one killed off the young folks.
197,"I do not disagree, however the question stands."
198,[removed]
199,We were wondering the other day about how those costumes usually seal around the neck or face and you wouldn't be exhaling into the pressurized space... welp.
200,lmao dallas metro alone is 8 mil
201,"Yeah, I love how it describes the mechanism in detail."
202,"So, because this Christmas may have been on elf your family members last, which is true for any family, you decided to risk *making it their last*?"
203,How many health experts need to say this before people get it.
204,"People are going to die, that‚Äôs the unfortunate reality of the situation."
205,Gathering like this only increases the chances
206,Yeah was never good at the in ‚Äúthrough the nose out through the mouth‚Äù thing during football conditioning so that may be part of the issue but yeah once it gets wet and gross it sucks
207,[removed]
208,"US may collapse in two months, or maybe one."
209,I'm not a medical professional but my understanding of antibody escape concerns is that rapid mutations can eventually produce a virus that won't be effected by the antibodies we've developed to fight the virus.
210,"The big issue in this virus is that all of the vaccines are targeting that spike protein, which is like a key to our cells' doors, so if a mutation that changes the shape of that protein occurs the vaccine will no longer work (ie, the antibodies produced will be looking for a spike that no longer exists)."
211,This is the UK.
212,You wipe your feet on the way out.
213,Boutta see this in Europe.
214,Yeah NY is hard.
215,Like California.
216,"But now youre arguing for the extreme case... Im just saying that for most of the US its totally possible, and actually so easy we set it up overnight."
217,"I didn‚Äôt say there‚Äôs no way, I said there‚Äôs no cheap and expedient way relative to a brand new vaccine that needs to roll out to everyone."
218,Dunno what you think the vaccine itself is if not a literal crash program.
219,We can easily test for antibodies but that‚Äôs **not** the same as testing for longer term B cell memory.
220,"We can do deeper tests but it‚Äôs not as simple as saying ‚Äúwell you have antibodies.‚Äù If it were then we‚Äôd have already said anyone who tested positive for antibodies, many many people already, are immune."
221,"I just needed to verify the type of person you are, and it makes sense."
222,Lose what argument?
223,lol you're literally dodging my question.
224,"winners of an ""argument"" do not dodge questions."
225,"this is the third time asking you now:

So, you are saying with a straight face that when old people and people with comorbidities get vaccinated, they will lift all restrictions and just let everyone else get sick?"
226,"Everything that the government has done so far, and you actually think that?"
227,They‚Äôre going to pull a complete 180 all of a sudden?
228,Lol you‚Äôre out of your damn mind.
229,"Based on your past comments, i was right on the money."
230,"It makes total sense now LOL

straight up weirdo.. i thought you have better things to do.. arguing with every single person you come across LOL straight up loser."
231,please answer my question.
232,During the first lockdown I had a real hankering for a kebab and had the bright idea of buying some of that frozen kebab meat.
233,I probably cooked it badly but it had the consistency of packing materials and tasted exactly how I imagine dog must.
234,they could tell the people they definitely have X number of doses &amp; then let a few extra stay if they a willing to take the chance to get a possible extra dose in some of the vials.

407,"No, sorry."
408,"It does not appear to be the same as the 'mink' virus, no - it has a different pattern of mutations in its DNA."
409,It appears this UK strain (which has a lot of mutations) came from the SE of UK (Kent) and is a Variant of Concern (VOC) because it is more contagious.
410,"\---------------Longer version

Viruses mutate all the time as they replicate and are spread to new hosts but this one stood out due to the sheer number of mutations in a pattern that hadn't been seen before."
411,It's an ongoing scientific investigation but the best theory at the moment is that this was first isolated in Kent from a positive test around September 2020 from someone who likely had the virus for quite a while (i.e.
412,for weeks or months - so called 'Long covid') such that it likely mutated multiple times inside the SAME person (which is less common).
413,"When the person was tested, a random sample was taken that also had its DNA sequenced a few weeks later (putting us some time in October - sequencing a complete virus genome requires a lot more work and time than a simple test for a virus, hence the lag) and added to a database of DNA sequences (UK has been doing this since March and has &gt;150,000 genomes sequenced - which is unprecedented in such a short amount of time)."
414,It was then noticed that the same mutation 'fingerprint' was cropping up in random samples more frequently in the SE (mainly London and Kent) over the next few weeks such that it appeared to be spreading much more quickly and out competing the old strain despite the lockdown at the time in November.
415,"The mink strain (which appeared to go from human, to mink and then back to humans that worked with Mink - again, the idea that farmed or wild animals can infect humans is a concern) also showed a lot of mutations but that 'fingerprint' is different to the UK strain - it just happened to crop up around the same time as did a similar South African strain that is also more contagious but again, is fairly different to the UK one."
416,"That may sound like a lot of coincidences but you've got to remember the sheer amount of covid infections out there in the world - mutations like this were predicted way back at the start (based on our experience of other viruses and previous pandemics) and as the number of global cases rose, it started to become more and more likely."

629,Milk
630,Why would leaving them out be less harmful to people though?
631,That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt buy that he was crazy versus intentional sabotage by someone for money or some other incentive.
632,"I didn't necessarily ask him myself; however, I witnessed the spirited ""debate"" at an internal conference."
633,"This was followed by a few more ""discussions"" at company happy hours."
634,"Yes, please don‚Äôt mess with the vaccine schedule."
635,We‚Äôre so close to some semblance of light at the end of the tunnel.
636,Yeah but like...what specifically do you mean?
637,"Fauci here is talking about sporting events, indoor dining, concerts, parties, etc."
638,"Maybe the world will change by allowing more permanent remote work and maybe more people will wear masks on planes, but if you're trying to tell me people are never gonna go to concerts again, i don't buy it"
639,"I noticed the year and still got worried, I am like perpetually stuck in December 2019"
640,"Probably because Australia has no covid to pass around, so you don't need to social distance or wear masks if there is no virus."
641,How would that work in practice?
642,If you got in a wreck and needed emergency care... would the ambulance folks just wait til you bleed out or something and then haul you off to the morgue?
643,What if you were in pretty bad shape but death wasn't imminent and you might last for a few more hours?
644,"I'd say prison is a bit far, but just fire them."
645,If they can get a job working somewhere else that's on them.
646,"I don't ever remember seeing actual body bags piled in said freezer trucks, just the trucks themselves"
647,You guys must try to triple it asap.
648,"At the current rate, only 90 million will be fully vax'd in 12 months."
649,"(Fauci's number, yesterday, extrapolated)."
650,"Next January, only 1/4 of all in the USA."
651,"Seriously, talk with management."
652,"If they don't, death and bed demand will be skyrocketing, and sustained for almost 4 years."
653,Thanks!
654,I agree the South Africa 501v2 strain is most concerning.
655,"The CBS article notes that the Oxford and J&amp;J trials are fortuitously timed to where we can test their efficacy against this variant, and we ahould know in a few weeks."
656,"But a few more weeks is more than enough time to seed the entire planet, so we should preemptively act accordingly"
657,"Yeah I don't see a total collapse in the US, but unfortunately there are regions that will see it, but just because there wont be a collapse in other places doesn't mean you play fast and loose, my state is making a good turn for the better and I hope that trend continues."
658,Restaurants by definition don‚Äôt involve universal masking and are demonstrably unsafe.
659,Nobody should be eating in restaurants where there is active commmnity transmission.
660,"&gt; fall or winter of next year 

2022?"
661,"Sounds like they are a communist, which is a valid political ideology that was surprisingly popular in the twentieth century."
662,I'm not a communist btw
663,I am pretty sure that would not be sufficient to stop the pandemic.
664,"Well, one possible answer is that we aren‚Äôt really at the brink of collapse."
665,You‚Äôre super-super-super uninformed.
666,AstraZeneca and J&amp;J are based on tech that was first approved this year (Adenovirus vectored vaccine) in J&amp;J‚Äôs Ebola vaccine.
667,The first human approved vectored vaccine is Merck‚Äôs Ebola vaccine that got it‚Äôs first approval in November 2018 (It used a live replication competent vesicular stomatitis virus as the vector to deliver the DNA so not exactly like AZ).
668,They‚Äôre all also genetic vectors.
669,mRNA vaccines insert mRNA.
670,The AZ/J&amp;J vaccines *directly insert DNA*.
671,Let me reiterate: You do not have even the basic understanding of what you are talking about and should probably just listen to people smarter than you.
672,"The largest vax mfg outfit is in India, by far, like 3 times anyone else."
673,They are supplying the Oxford vax.
674,"But if we're seriously at the brink of a collapse, like this article says, where they are turning people away and leaving people behind whom they can't save, why aren't we using them then?"
675,They should be filling NFL stadiums and school gyms if this is the case.
676,It doesn't make any sense to me.
677,She voted for Trump‚Äôs agenda over 50% of the time.
678,A bisexual woman who rubber stamped the agenda of a guy who despises women MOST of the time.
679,What a great Senator
680,People like you make me realize China's way is right.
681,Gov should be more intrusive and use GPS trackers and notify infections with forced quarantines.
682,Like how Taiwan and Vietnam is doing now.
683,Not with half ass measures like western countries are doing.
684,Actually it was a bit earlier.
685,"Full timeline from WHO:

[https://www.who.int/news/item/29-06-2020-covidtimeline](https://www.who.int/news/item/29-06-2020-covidtimeline)"
686,This isn't going to happen and people should stop pretending it will.
687,"So if that‚Äôs a semblance of normality (defined as the appearance of, but not the reality of) then what‚Äôs still going to be significantly abnormal by fall, I wonder."
688,"Having a plumber come over tomorrow, tried everything to fix my drain but don‚Äôt have a choice."
689,If he wears a mask and I open all the windows and leave them open to let it air out after he leaves that should reduce risk of possible transmission right?
690,the 'conspiracy' is true if he has the power to mess with the vaccine himself... /s
691,Vive la France.
692,"I'm in my 40s, and frankly I'm disappointed and appalled at how slow tech is moving, and how often it moves in the wrong direction."
693,"My washing machine looks exactly like the washing machine I grew up with, because those Maytag mechanical transmission models run forever."
694,"I mean, other than smartphones, the internet, and the fact that there is always something my screen that I actually want to watch, tech is mostly a disappointment moving at the speed of cold molasses."
695,Because they seem to think it only kills those in vulnerable populations.
696,"Newsflash, maskholes: covid kills everyone."
697,I know twenty somethings who've died.
698,My uncle knows a toddler who got very sick.
699,"Mandate the vaccine, prison for those who don't comply."
700,Their population density is also much higher and their GDP also much lower.
701,Probably not as crazy as a country averaging &gt;2500 deaths a day for 2 months and not having any national mask mandate or lockdown.
702,"Yes, it is."
703,You don't mess with dosage.
704,Here's a great vaccines [rabbit hole](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/articles/great_vaccinator) on RadioLab.
705,"I worked on some of them, albeit in marketing, not on the science end."
706,"Back then, the ad budgets were miniscule."
707,Know why?
708,Because they did not need any help from marketing.
709,Virtually everyone considered them a boon to humankind.
710,Supposedly its also from learnings from when everyone rushed to develop a SARS vaccine.
711,"That dosage schedule worked for another coronavirus, why not this one?"
712,"Just saying, the conspiracy subreddit has been real quiet for the last year about all those celebrities apparently eating babies"
713,And there are still people who think it isn‚Äôt even real.
714,"1) They should all take the vaccine, as should everyone else to whom it is available."
715,"2) They should get a bigass bonus for dealing with the worst of the pandemic, and the consequenes of the idiotic behavior of so many Americans."
716,That there are healthcare workers who don't want to take the vaccine is a big issue.
717,Props to whatever administrator figured out a way to at least partially sidestep this issue and reward the folks who were going to take it anyways.
718,"Victoria had like 7-8 months of hard lockdown, I guess he is referring to that."
719,"True true, yeah I'm thinking that hopefully given his comments re: Fall '21 as a return to normality, he means a renewed interest in preventing Pandemics and changes in healthcare accessibility, and not ""you can't see a football game ever""."
720,One of the glaring issues throughout all this is bad weird awkward public health messaging.
721,Hope there's a post mortem on that.
722,"There is an important person, private suites area in Cedars Sinai."
723,I believe it's on one of the top floors.
724,Larry may have fundraised for them.
725,"They must use those beds, so when Larry came along, up he went."
726,I don't fault anyone there.
727,"When he walks out having beat Covid, that will attract more high end biz for the entire range of medical services."
728,They are at or close to the state the medical arts.
729,He's a walking advertisement if he walks out healthy.
730,It's not

750,Well if people can‚Äôt support their fucking family how will they survive?
751,Either pay them to shut down or fuck off.
752,People shouldn‚Äôt lose their livelihoods at this point.
753,Stay the fuck home if you‚Äôre vulnerable until the vaccine comes.
754,Not reasonable to ask people to lose everything for something 99.7% of people under 70 survive
755,[removed]
756,It‚Äôs because the US should offer a furlough scheme
757,Lol so that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre doing this?
758,To get the last word?
759,oh my word... hahahhaha I guess you‚Äôll be taking the L all night then.
760,projecting?
761,"What can I possibly be projecting, miss?"
762,I think you need a friend.
763,Do you need a shoulder?
764,Its pretty clear by now that the US as a group lacks the political will and the personal responsibility to do away with COVID via social distancing.
765,"Even if the US managed it, there about 100 other countries all struggling with the same problem."
766,"New waves of COVID will keep coming for years at this rate, and the virus will only keep mutating as it infects more people."
767,Vaccination  is the only way to get rid the the virus and back to normal any time in the next 3 years.
768,"Haha, pretty big jump from ‚Äúwear a mask‚Äù to ‚Äúgive everything you own away‚Äù dum dum"
769,RemindMe!
770,4 weeks
771,"No need to imagine, it's happening right now"
772,"Yes, the British Flu spreads like wildfire and has already ripped through Ireland in just a couple of weeks."
773,That's a good point.
774,"I'm pretty sure we have seen re-infections even without a new variant in the US, but it's not common."
775,"I would, without a shred of hesitation, divorce his fucking ass immediately upon waking up from my coma."
776,Stupid Fuck.
777,I‚Äôm so tired of the 45% + of Americans who are just like this guy.
778,Makes me want to just give up.
779,"That seems pointless, surely this will result in loads bring poured down the drain?"
780,Thats why it says turning point and not return to normality
781,But the US isn't fucking it up...
782,"I don't know, I'm not part of the French gov and I'd love to get the vaccine before the Summer."
783,People talk all the time about Trump but Macron and his ministers aren't doing any better.
784,It's a disaster.
785,Does Boris look like Big Brother ?
786,"Oops, yes he does."
787,Doesn't help when several of the workers in such stores are wearing face shields instead of masks.
788,I've seen that at a few places and I turn around and leave.
789,yeah but those people are supposed to be pro-life
790,"Yeah, my closest friend lost his dad recently, and his grandad is on his deathbed."
791,No fucking way am I leaving him alone.
792,"&gt; Actually, the government never cared about enforcing the rules."
793,Trump was even worse than apathetic.
794,"He sought to weaponize Covid-19 to both hammer the Democratic base with illness and work up his base with ""anti-mask open up the economy"" belligerence."
795,"There is a fictional series about ""pandemic fascism"" on Netfix called The Barrier."
796,You might think they slapped it together quickly after Covid-19 landed.
797,It was actually made in early to mid 2019 and released in Spain during January 2020.
798,I don‚Äôt give a shit about Fauci.
799,He said what he said for the reasons explained in the same article.
800,I‚Äôm not here to argue that he‚Äôs right.
801,I‚Äôm talking about your claims that the country is being worn out with the messaging.
802,It‚Äôs completely wrong.
803,And pay me first.
804,"""1984"" is only one generation ago."
805,This is actually a very common theme.
806,I‚Äôve heard this explanation a few times even Among nurses I work with of all things if you can believe it
807,It sounds like we have both exhausted our wits and our resources.
808,I so hope we get sorted out soon.
809,:(
810,One could hope that out of date vaccines still provide some degree of protection.
811,Perhaps enough to smooth the transition from one vaccine version to the next.
812,"don't have any hope of those people switching their minds when ""dead facts"" are under their nose, they will have another messed up theory to shout at that moment as well, even when dying of it (""the government/extraterrestrials has managed to poison me and kill me because I KNOW THINGS, arg !"
813,"""."
814,lmao this sub
815,Not a pharmacist but a former classmate of mine has a masters and undergrad in Electrical Engineering from a top school and now works at NIST but he is still a fully invested Trump nut/anti-vax/new earth wacko.
816,What super high doses are you talking about here?
817,Standard vitamin d supplement doses?
818,I feel like you are comparing total uk cases to recent az cases.
819,A lot of first responders and medical personnel are under 50.
820,I don't see the value in cancelling and delaying the entire vaccine production.
821,It's left EU in a lurch now.
822,I know someone who works there.
823,They had a holiday party for staff in the ER breakroom (against the rules) where there was no social distancing and most weren't wearing masks because they were eating and drinking.
824,Dumbest shit ever.
825,To think getting a Switch was just as hard at the start of the first lockdown.
826,Happy cake day auto mod!
827,Ok I go sleep now
828,Yup.
829,"Combined with the fact that Japan has literally done nothing to combat this disease, while having a government that sponsored a travel and eat out program all the way up until just under a month ago."
830,"Yes, people wear masks, but we're all used to doing that anyway."
831,I can't tell if the bureaucracy here is just that stupid or if it's actually malicious at this point.
832,Well I live in the Netherlands and we haven't even started because our IT software to monitor the vaccinations was not done yet.
833,I just don't get why we didn't have this already months before.
834,&gt; And it is just untrue that children dont spread it as much as adults.
835,"You know that, I know that, statistics on other diseases show it."
836,"The government keeps saying ""it's not proven"" Which as a literal statement is true, because it doesn't actually say anything."
837,What amount of money is worth more than a human life?
838,"I can tell you that mainstream media is far from perfect, but I have a friend who regularly sends me ""non mainstream facts"" that I UTTERLY DESTROY with scientific approach and a few google searches and, after one year, I'm so tired of doing that sh**, that I'm not talking with him anymore (he feels he's so smart by propagating non verified claims)."
839,I suggested opening our mouths really big to let the sunlight go in
840,"I mean, the USA is massive geographically and population wise."
841,It‚Äôs basically like asking most of the EU to have some kind of coordinated effort
842,100?
843,That‚Äôs a sun city Sunday drive son.
844,"I agree, that suit is positive pressure and not negative pressure."
845,If the costume was negative pressure it would be deflated.
846,"Poor person, wrong place at the wrong time taking unnecessary blame."
847,I‚Äôve heard they are incredibly strict with the uniforms and do spots checks almost daily.
848,Is that right?
849,Some of those people are tired of getting sick every year because others come to work sick.
850,Some people feel bad that they have to come to work sick (pre-pandemic) and see masks as a way to relieve that guilt.
851,"I feel like a greater proportion of people will feel comfortable wearing masks when ill, and others are likely to be less judgemental and suspicious of said mask."
852,Do I expect to regularly see people wearing masks during flu season?
853,No.
854,"But I expect the few people doing so won't be told that they are breaking the rules, that the no mask policies of places that had no legal requirement forcing them are mostly gone for good."
855,It's a moot point because Moderna is only expecting to make 600 million doses in all of 2021.
856,Equity and social justice worries?
857,"Well, it's pointless since no third world nation will be able to get a real supply of the Pfizer/Moderna vaccine, especially with the US banning exports."
858,It's like worrying if Tesla distribution will be equitable when they're backlogged for the next 3 years with queued orders.
859,"Middle income and lower income countries will most likely rely on a combination of Oxford, Sputnik, and Sinovac (and maybe Covaxin)."
860,Those are all stable at normal fridge temps.
861,I‚Äôm a respiratory therapist here.
862,All I can say is fuck my life.
863,What if no one lets you in their support bubble?
864,Each household is only allowed one additional single person; you might not be the top choice.
865,"It's ineffective for people over 50, it's even worse."
866,But anyway people under 50 won't be able to get vaccinated until this summer.
867,So 1 million vaccinations a day!
868,/s
869,[removed]
870,Never seen so much incompetence and mixed messaging.
871,Also inconsistencies between uk nations confusing matters.
872,"As such, people don‚Äôt want to comply, don‚Äôt know how to comply, or think they are the exception."

878,*
879,People in UK live in one tier &amp; commute to another.
880,So they work in London &amp; go home to a tier-2/3 area to spread it there.
881,Some of the people in their tier-2/3 area work in Birmingham or some other city...
882,The government responds by spreading the size of the tier-4 area but based on currently reported cases.
883,So always a week too late to stop it spreading.
884,This is true.
885,SA variant we are seeing blatantly made up claims all over the place.
886,"Also cynically, South Africa is more ‚Äúexotic‚Äù to Americans so the media can make up way more shit and people will believe it"
887,"2008 was supposed to be the One, the point where currencies became worthless and the global economy peaked for good, but we kicked the can down the road and let the problem fester."
888,"But we could've let it run and chug along until we gradually shifted to some automated, renewable-powered society in the 2030s."
889,COVID-19 fuckslapped that away.
890,"Or should I say, our pisspoor response fuckslapped that away."
891,"If the house of cards collapses again, we are so fucked."
892,Hahaha please.
893,I'm enjoying this.
894,"Like I'm gonna let a simpleton like you have the last word

Does beg the question why you're still here."
895,Projecting again?
896,At least respond to the right  comment moron üôÑ
897,[removed]
898,You're basically saying Businesses &gt; people's lives.
899,You probably also think masks restrict Oxygen too.
900,You're part of the problem.
901,This is not really the issue there.
902,There's still about half of the population that wants to get the vaccine but we won't be able to until at least June.
903,"The gov wants to vaccine elder people in nursing home first and has said something about ""waiting for more vaccines to be developed (by other labs)."
904,We're mostly starting to think that 1) many places can't store the current vaccines 2) the gov wants the Sanofi vaccine and it isn't ready (the second point is borderline conspiracy theory but most people wouldn't trust the gov anymore as they've been dealing badly with the crisis and never admit their mistakes).
905,I hadn't heard that the mrna vaccines attack more aspects.
906,I thought they just used a different mechanism that forces the body to produce the spike protein itself which the immune system then attempts to neutralize.
907,It‚Äôs good to quarantine to be safe.
908,Having a negative means it‚Äôs more likely to have another ailment.
909,"Having a false negative is less likely than food poising/flu/bad cold/ other combined

So just watch out for non covid symptoms and don‚Äôt purely assume it‚Äôs covid but still quarantine in case"
910,Have you been living under a rock?
911,There are countless people ignoring social distancing.
912,"Hell South Korea hasn't needed a national lockdown ever AFAIK, at least not during the first wave."
913,Their rapid testing rollout and contact tracing meant that the virus never got out of control enough that everyone needed to stay home.
914,And they're like almost right next to China
915,"It‚Äôs crazy to think that COVID-19‚Äôs US deaths will rival the Spanish Flu, *even with our modern medical interventions*."
916,Imagine if COVID-19 had been the 1918 pathogen.
917,Very valid points.
918,"I see in the HDI we are #16 in 2019, which is nothing to be proud of."
919,I think I just get a bit incensed when I see overly enthusiastic slogging of Canada.
920,"I feel like it's often lazy, reactive and inaccurate.That said, posting ""we're #1 at something"" is also, admittedly, a bit reactive...we're all just bumbling idiots trying to do what we think is right."
921,I‚Äôm  respiratory therapist and I kid you not I have some guy down the street coming begging me for albuterol of all things just because he knows that‚Äôs what I do.
922,And he wants to know if I have spare vaccines on me.
923,Scary as hell really.
924,"Yeah, the current brain trusts didn't want to do so much testing to try to figure out how much is out there in the first place."
925,"I've been assuming it's all around and that it's been way under-reported, if anything, because I don't know how the sample of people being tested is figured (ie, I don't think the people being tested are a straight cross-section of the population that can be easily extrapolated)..."
926,Funny how states have rights.
927,"The good thing is that some of the existing vaccines can be continuously tweaked to cater to these mutations, just means maybe we get a new jab every six months."
928,Better than zero solution
929,"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/24/health/herd-immunity-covid-coronavirus.html

930,He lead off with dishonesty.
931,And fuck you.
932,[removed]
933,May he rest in peace.
934,Given that the vaccine mRNA encodes the spike protein I believe that won‚Äôt happen in this case.
935,Depends on if you have appetite.
936,"As usual, if you don‚Äôt want to eat anything or drink cause sick, just get guilty pleasures that you will be more inclined to scarf down."
937,"It‚Äôs more Important to consume food than to barely consume healthy food when sick

If you are hungry and drink, then do try to drink orange juice, juice, water a lot."
938,"And try to eat healthy, still suggest proteins"
939,Sometimes I wish the government would go on full dictator mode in dealing with psychos like that.
940,"Not saying that they should be killed but simply ""**convince**"" them to stfu..."

948,"&gt;It would seem they had an easier time getting an unauthorized dose of the Chinese vaccine than one from Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Johnson and Johnson, or other Western vaccines."
949,What's the thought process in this assumption (they chose Chinese vaccine because the Western ones are harder to get)?
950,"It could be that they have inside information on the actual efficacy of the vaccines, or opting to go for the old technology vs the new mRNA, or some other reasons."
951,How bloody hard is it to set the decision dates before people return from holiday?
952,I have to say that I am really appreciating the basic competence shown by Finlands politicians.
953,"Schools are starting again on thursday and previous restrictions end on sunday, so today the Helsinki area Corona task force is announcing what restrictions are going to be on effect and which age groups are going to be in distance learning."
954,"I mean, this isn't political, it's just the basic competence of the mayors and other city officials to time decisions reasonably."

976,There are no LINE1 elements in the mRNA vaccine.
977,"And there are no primers available for reverse transcription via RNAse H.  Other than those, we don't have endogenous reverse transcriptases in humans."
978,Probably in no small part to the pittance the teachers get and the massive bloat of the administration.

996,"I don‚Äôt feel deprived of oxygen or anything, but now when I try to fall asleep, I start to fall asleep but then I wake up in a sudden panic like I‚Äôm out of breath."

1004,"In a way, it's hard to blame them."
1005,I believe Japan isn't planning on approving any vaccines until March.
1006,"Maybe they plan on rolling them out faster than even Israel when they do eventually approve them, hopefully having learned from the good and bad strategies other countries have been using, but I really don't see how they can approve it in March and be ready to host the Olympics in the summer."

1017,I've been looking for a good fear porn sub.
1018,Noice!
1019,Red rooms weren't doing it for me anynore.
1020,There were only six weeks during a seven month period that restrictions were temporarily slightly eased.

1026,how is this a good analogy
1027,"https://apnews.com/article/genomics-johannesburg-coronavirus-pandemic-africa-south-africa-73cc92665392f2bc94764daeff57e823

We are urgently doing experiments in the laboratory to test the South African variant, 501.V2,
against the blood of people with antibodies and against the blood of people who have received
vaccines."
1028,"The tests, called neutralizing assays, will help determine the reliability of vaccines
against the variant."
1029,"So no longer a conspiracy theorist,  should be charged with bio terrorism."
1030, Don't make up stuff if you don't know.
1031,France has tens of thousands of vaccine doses laying around and  hundreds of thousands arriving with each passing week.
1032,This doesn't even  begin to explain the slowness of vaccinations.
1033,And Germany had over a  million doses already back in december.

And anybody who upvoted them, shame on you for helping spread disinformation."
1035,"‚Äã

...So what's the real reason?"
1036,"Basically it seems to be that the  government wanted to begin with the most vulnerable patients (people in  care homes) but these people are more difficult to vaccinate (no  mobility so the vaccine must come to them, geographical dispersion in  small establishments spread in all of France, often difficult to obtain  consent due to diminished discernment and high antivax sentiment), all  of which is made even more difficult by a terrible procedure (need to  have a medical doctor explain the vaccine to you, then a couple of days  to think about it, before you can actually get vaccinated)."
1037,Meanwhiles  the vaccine doses are lying around even though other people would like  to use them.
1038,I call bs
1039,this sub hahaha
1040,Because they slept on buying from those even when it was clear they would work and apparently haggled over money.
1041,So Pfizer just went to other countries happy to distribute their vaccine.
1042,And again you fail to show where its been posted as all other subs do
1043,&gt;Why are you trying to downplay successful countries like NZ?
1044,That's not my goal.
1045,I believe the NZ response have been absolutely great.
1046,Please don't assume that I'm arguing in bad faith or have some hidden motives.
1047,"What I'm trying to do is to establish our common priors, and to pinpoint more precisely where our disagreement lies."
1048,I believe that's foundational to a healthy rational debate.
1049,There's no point arguing if we don't even know where we disagree.
1050,From my perspective you don't seem very interested in figuring out where we agree and disagree though.
1051,"If I'm wrong about that, please prove me wrong."
1052,Now I've put in some effort and actually answered your question as well as I could.
1053,"If you find some part of my answer unsatisfactory, you can ask another question so I can clarify."
1054,"Now, can you please return the favor and do the same?"
1055,"Even if you don't believe me, just assume for a second that I'm arguing in good faith and give me a straight up, non-evasive, good faith answer to my question."
1056,Do you believe that being a remote island in the middle of nowhere comes with any kind of advantage in terms of keeping an infectious disease out?
1057,&gt;It‚Äôs just as easy to simply close the border and implement the same policies.
1058,I believe that is just absolutely false.
1059,"We can look at another example, Slovenia."
1060,"They started out similarly to NZ, they locked down and completely eradicated the disease within their borders before the summer."
1061,"However, their geographical position is very different from that of NZ."
1062,Slovenia is a country in the middle of Europe.
1063,"Controlling their land borders would be a lot harder than only controlling a fixed amount of seaports and airports, and they're economically dependent on trucks that cross their border every day."
1064,"They're also part of the EU, which means that there are external political pressure on what they choose to do with their borders as well, and even if they did close their borders, it would be a lot easier for people to sneak in unnoticed."
1065,To say that it would be just as easy for Slovenia to keep an infectious disease out as it would be for NZ is just absolutely asinine to me.
1066,"It seems to me that you're not arguing based on what you believe is true, but based on what you want to be true."
1067,Who was it Tiffany Dover?
1068,Haven't seen her on social media in a bit.
1069,How is it a bad precedent?
1070,I think a big problem seems to be political infighting and poor messaging.
1071,"Let's take 2 examples, 1 from England, 1 from Finland."
1072,Both around same time in November.
1073,"Manchester area is having a spike, hospitals are getting full, every measurement says it's in tier 4."
1074,"The mayor flights for days about putting on restrictions, trying to get an monetary aid package for businesses."
1075,"Helsinki area is having a spike, most tier 3 (our highest) definitions are reached (except hospitalizations, hospitals are still empty)."
1076,"The mayors (4 cities, 3 mayors, 4th said they would follow) gathered with the rest of the task force, declared themselves to be in tier 3 and started issuing restrictions."
1077,At the press conference they stated that since the restrictions are required by the government and health officials they expect government to provide aid to businesses needing it.
1078,That's it.
1079,They didn't use peoples lives as bargaining chip.
1080,And just to be clear 2 of the 3 mayors were political appointments (3rd is a civil servant) and they are members of the biggest national opposition party.
1081,"First you do what you need to protect people, then you focus on the long term livelyhood."
1082,The pub owner or server isn't going to need that aid money in the grave.
1083,It's even worse.
1084,He put the vials back into the fridge afterwards.
1085,Now a few people don't know whether they got a working first dose or a ruined one or something in between
1086,Where are you getting that from?
1087,The problem is life is already back to normal

1100,3.

That's basically it."

So..."
1106,"&gt;	Within the EU, France has had its own specific issues that have meant its vaccination programme has progressed at a glacial pace so far."
1107,"With one of the world‚Äôs most vaccine-sceptical populations, France had by the weekend only managed to inoculate 516 people compared with the UK‚Äôs 1 million, despite having 500,000 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine."
1108,"Man, and I thought vaccine skeptics here in the US were bad."
1109,"Woohoo, we're not the worst at something for a change!"
1110,/s
1111,"&gt;I think this would hit some people harder if there were at least a few articles detailing exactly what a healthcare system collapse will look like, in grim detail."
1112,"Something titled ""It's August 2021, and America's Healthcare System Has Totally Collapsed: Here's What It's Like""."
1113,"Then we'll finally take it ""seriously"", take harsh measures for a couple weeks but then it won't be as bad as ""predicted"" (since we actually did something to stop it) so people will get mad that they can't have a 12 person birthday party at Applebees"
1114,The virus can mutate to the point where the vaccine becomes ineffective.
1115,That can happen when the virus exists in a host with partial immunity.
1116,"The immunity isn't strong enough to suppress the virus, thus giving the virus the opportunity to mutate so it evades the vaccine."
1117,Something similar probably led to the new variant.
1118,The variant mutated in a single host who probably received different experimental treatments because his immune system wasn't strong enough to beat the virus for a period of time.
1119,That's also been shown to happen in lab tests.
1120,We don't know about long-term immunity at this point.
1121,Most infections in the vaccinated p3 trial group occurred before the 2nd shot.
1122,&gt;You'd need more than that to run the trials.
1123,These numbers don't count the volunteers who participated in trials.
1124,That‚Äôs what I meant by government support is a joke.
1125,"I actually am sympathetic to their plight, but that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that encouraging social activity, like eating indoors in groups when we have such high community spread is a bad idea."
1126,Still there is quite a lot of data about pong term effects of the disease as well as lots of anecdotal stories (just browse Reddit forums r/coronavirus).
1127,For the vaccine there is nothing.
1128,Not saying it proves it one way or another but fear of the disease is much more substantiated.
1129,"Besides being late to the Party and getting vaccines last because the initial hopes of the CSL vaccine were crushed(and so we‚Äôre the 51m doses they ordered) so, they had to make a new order with Oxford, but they can‚Äôt get more than 5.8 million by ‚Äúearly 2021‚Äù 

You are saying that Aus has 50m vaccines coming but they are not rushing through emergency approval."
1130,Let‚Äôs say they after only 6 weeks extra they find something(they won‚Äôt) are they going to bin 50m vaccines ?
1131,6 weeks is not going to reveal anymore about the safety or long term effects of the vaccine.
1132,Us regular Joe‚Äôs are all going to be getting the same vaccines.
1133,Unless a mutant strain makes the current vaccine ineffective.
1134,"I‚Äôd say that every country is rushing to get vaccines approved as fast as possible,so that they can get the economy back up and kicking."
1135,Australia is making lame excuses.
1136,I lived in Aus for 15 years and I am used to their politics bullshit.
1137,Correct.
1138,Quite frankly I am disappointed with this reporter.
1139,Like most other folks I was a bit confused by the announcement - but after watching Dr Ella's impassioned defense I found it pretty convincing.
1140,It's sad that BBC as usual ignored the science in his talk and focused on bullshit Modi vs Congress politics.
1141,"Here's the video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuLJ6rKZhsY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuLJ6rKZhsY)

0) This is a virus built on the most studied classical platform of inactivated viruses."
1142,This platform is eligible for pre-approval by Indian law (unlike MRNA/DNA based platforms).
1143,1) The vaccine has higher immunogenicity than any existing non-MRNA vaccine in phase I/II trials.
1144,2) The vaccine has a better safety profile than any other vaccine reported till now including the chinese and russian vaccinies.
1145,"3) We know that the immune response (which is higher than Oxford/AZ, lasts for 6+ months in Indians)

4) Since it uses the whole response it elicits an immune response to multiple proteins in the virus not just the spike protein which is targeted by most other platforms - it might work better on the new strain."
1146,"5) Post phase II  emergency use approval has happened in the past for SARS, MERS and Ebola vaccines."
1147,So we know it's safer that Oxford/AZ and we know it produces a higher immune response.
1148,"That implies there's a pretty damn good chance it works, and it is definitely not harmful."
1149,3) More hypothetical point - adenovirus vector based vaccines may not work for repeat vaccinations once humans develop immunity to the adenovirus vector itself.
1150,Russian and Chinese vaccines may not work in India at all as the Indian population is 80% + seropositive for human adenoviruses.
1151,Just look at Italy example.
1152,History will repeat.
1153,You either shut down or crash the system and shut down.
1154,Pick.
1155,With so many death the economy going to collapse.
1156,"Then imagine it happening in more places and to more people, I guess?"
1157,Shit's bad
1158,He even looks like a weirdo.
1159,"So is it that the Arizona figures are:
In a day, ~100/100k are positive, and this is averaged over the 7 days?"
1160,"So to compare to the UK numbers, you'd need to multiply Arizona by 7?"
1161,"Hanging on there, beautiful people, the vaccines are here, this bad situation won't be long."
1162,There's no evidence that he was dishonest.
1163,[He later said](https://www.businessinsider.com/fauci-doesnt-regret-advising-against-masks-early-in-pandemic-2020-7) that more study revealed the effectiveness of homemade masks and the danger of asymptomatic spread.
1164,"&gt;""When it became clear that the infection could be spread by asymptomatic carriers who don't know they're infected, that made it very clear that we had to strongly recommend masks,"" he said."
1165,"&gt;""And also, it soon became clear that we had enough protective equipment and that cloth masks and homemade masks were as good as masks that you would buy from surgical supply stores,"" Fauci added."

1190,Of course.
1191,I live in WA state.
1192,The attitudes are two different worlds.

1198,It's the insane anti maskers who will never see this message
1199,Seriously.
1200,The circumstances surrounding this vaccine are unusual and there's alot of pressure to take it.
1201,There's even a possibility that it won't be a decision for long considering the outcry to place a mandate and they're acting like its wild that people might not want to sign their right away to sue?
1202,What?
1203,Sars was spreading because u couldnt infect others unless showing symptoms.
1204,"If this virus mutated to a version with a 30% mortality rate, it wouldnt matter at all because aside from asymptomatic spread, there is also pre-symptomatic spread."
1205,That‚Äôs what people dont get.
1206,"Now, you dont need a high viral load to become infected."
1207,And it probably developed that from Africa having a very young population.
1208,Mortality is the same or maybe a little more lethal as a ton of people keep dying despite better treatment.
1209,"Heck, its a worse than the initial first wave because we upped bed and icu capacity, we have mask mandates and social distancing yet the number of people dying is increasing in North America, Europe and Africa."
1210,That seems to be the way globally.
1211,Let‚Äôs wait until the deaths are already banked before we do anything.
1212,It‚Äôs unbelievably frustrating to see this train wreck again and again.
1213,So you believe that Fauci downplayed covid?
1214,Username checks out.
1215,"I work in EMS so let me run through the scenarios here with you: 

If you're bleeding out, and a medic arrives on scene they will likely use a pressure bandage or tq to stop the bleeding."
1216,They'll start an IV (especially in LA) and likely start a fluid drip.
1217,They might give you other medications depending on your condition.
1218,They will transport you to the ER.
1219,Tourniquets can hold for quite a few hours - so you might find yourself waiting in the ER if you're cleared of other injuries.
1220,"If there were other injuries that rendered you critical, you'd likely be taken immediately into a resuscitation room - which are the big old ER rooms with tons of space for moving parts - and you would be assessed there."
1221,We still triage very critical patients.
1222,From there you might go to surgery/another floor.
1223,"If you are at the scene and you are bleeding out fast and in front of them you go into cardiac arrest and your heart stops, they will likely use medications and chest compressions for a bit- but honestly traumatic arrests (where your heart stops because of major trauma) are almost always a lost cause."
1224,[The survival rate is 2%.
1225,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4961534/) So it is more than likely you'll be pronounced at scene and transported to the morgue.
1226,"If you have bleeds they cannot stop (internal) and your heart stops in the back of the ambulance while on the way to the hospital, if it's quite close they will perform compressions and take you into the ER pumping away."
1227,Doctors will then try to resuscitate you.
1228,"It likely won't work, but they will try."
1229,Again survival is 2% once you arrest.
1230,"If you are quite far en route when you die, they will likely stop the ambulance so both EMS people can work on you."
1231,If they do not get return of circulation after going through the normal efforts (i.e.
1232,your heart starts pumping on its own)  you'll be pronounced dead.
1233,"That said, if you get in a wreck and bleed out and your heart stops and you die before medics get there, they will also not cart your dead body to the hospital."
1234,Because you are dead and doctors aren't magician.
1235,Then you go to the morgue.
1236,It is genuinely that simple.
1237,"Again you're looking at cumulative 7 day averages, meaning a week's worth of cases packed into one number."
1238,Look at the actual daily cases at the top of the article.
1239,They don't match at all.
1240,"It's certainly a rant, but it seems far better to me to fix the vaccine distribution than give people half doses."
1241,"People wont accept lockdowns for another year, I know I wont"
1242,It tooo melbourne four months of hard lockdown to eliminate the virus from a peak of 700+ cases per day in a population of 5M
1243,Chinese vaccine (in this story) is de-activated virus vaccine.
1244,"There is some 'concern' about Pfizer or Moderna's mRNA vaccine, that the rich don't want to take any risk."
1245,It feels like a matter of time now for my state (California) to have a major lockdown.
1246,"It‚Äôs getting real bad over here and the ‚Äúlockdown‚Äù that we have right now isn‚Äôt even a lockdown since malls, stores, and other places are still open."
1247,"The idea among so much of the western civilization  that ""this could never happen to us"" is what caused the pandemic to spread this much in the first place."
1248,"If you keep ignoring the problem, this can happen anywhere, no matter how great you think your country is."
1249,That's complete bullshit.
1250,"France has over 500,000 vaccines laying around."
1251,My husband had loss of taste and smell and is on o2 right now at the hospital :/ But he is recovering.
1252,How many certain deaths are we - in your opinion - talking about?
1253,"The London data:
&gt;Rate of people with at least one positive COVID-19 test result (either lab-reported or lateral flow device) per 100,000 population in the rolling 7-day period ending on the dates shown
Arizona:
&gt;The state is reporting 121.8 newly confirmed COVID-19 cases over the past seven days per 100,000 people

As far as I can see, both are reporting the total number of positive cases in the past 7 days, per 100k, unless I'm missing anything?"
1254,Please.
1255,I'll give you permission to flip your shit.
1256,"I would be a very, very grateful healthcare worker."
1257,Maybe if it were worse.
1258,There are almost 8 billion people in the world.
1259,A few million isn‚Äôt even a fraction of the population.
1260,"It is horrible and upsetting because people aren‚Äôt just a number, but if you want to talk population controlling plague, I imagine more and immediate damage would have to be done."
1261,&gt; Why make it harder on yourself?
1262,I will absolutely get the vaccine as soon as I am able to but I am also a relatively young healthy person working from home who had a relatively easy time social distancing until recently.
1263,"I am at a much lower risk of catching it than someone working with people in person, at a much lower risk of spreading it if I do catch it and very likely to have a comparatively light case."
1264,This is all to say that there is much much greater value in inoculating an e.g.
1265,"doctor, nurse, delivery person or restaurant cook."
1266,You've probably heard of the 80/20 principle and (in a very rough sense) it applies here too- if you manage to inoculate the right 20% of the population you can get 80% of the benefits of herd immunity with relatively light lockdown measures.
1267,"Its going to take at least another 4 months (very optimistically) until there are more doses available than people willing to receive the vaccine, so delaying a few weeks to get the right people vaccinated early on is probably still beneficial."
1268,Try looking at the death rate for Spanish flu.
1269,"It doesn't last long, but that's because it's hosts all die."
1270,Not a good solution for the countries it does reach.
1271,To be fair Denmark is moving very quickly
1272,Fauci has been saying fall since Pfizer announced good results though.
1273,There are two famous newsmen from Melbourne.
1274,Rupert Murdoch and Julian Assange.
1275,Like a pandemic?
1276,It applies to them as well all epidemiologic models are based on the same parameters.
1277,"Japan had a way worse first wave then Taiwan because it listened to the CCP and kept flights going for diplomatic reasons, and none of these countries had a lockdown as everywhere the summer drove numbers down and at least Japan is going through a pretty bad second wave now, nowhere near ""elimination of the virus""."
1278,And this is all with compliance rates for masks and social distancing that you could never get in the west.
1279,"And again don't listen to me listen to the WHO, they said anything above R0 of 2.5 can't be contained, and they have specific guidelines for this."
1280,"Now each county is different in the resources it has but for example Germany said they can do contact tracing for up to 50 cases/100k/day, beyond that they can't stop the exponential spread."
1281,"And again masks help but the electrostatic properties ware off in 30min for surgical masks and 2h for the FFP2 masks, beyond that they get saturated and work about as well as a scarf which is not much at all."
1282,"Now this is all well and good for professionals they switch surgical masks per pacient and the better ones regularly, they also wear eye protection."
1283,"The general public won't have the discipline to wear masks everywhere, wear it properly and change it every day."
1284,I'm not concerned about washing hands and contact spread the viral load getting to your lungs is so small it's actually preferable to get infected that way as the studies show the immune system ramps up faster then the replication rate and you get milder symptoms.
1285,"Again all and all just to say you can't really exterminate the virus once it's endemic to dense cities, and beyond masks, social distancing, being locked in your house you need more hospitals, ventilators, ambulances, nurses and vitamin D dosing of the public like in Sweden(milk) or Africa (bread), the UK started doing it but their doses are 20% what they should be for normal levels."
1286,"And to finish personal attacks are missplaced, I took the virus as a concern due to reports from laowhy86 and Peekprosperity back in January and have been isolating with my wife the whole year working from home."
1287,But even I can see the increased media pressure and the compliance fatigue from the public.
1288,"Others have eloquently expressed the obvious impact of this, but I can't begin to comprehend what this does mentally to the ambulance workers- having to decide whether someone lives or dies is not what they signed up for."
1289,"I'm sure they all thought they would only ever be increasing people's chance of survival, not just abandoning them."
1290,Awful situation all round.
1291,So basically he still doesn't take it seriously.
1292,Such an a-h.
1293,"Looking for the silver lining of this crazy increase in cases we're going through worldwide, we might have vaccine readouts earlier than expected:

\- Johnson &amp; Johnson should have more than enough data to ask for approval in this very day, but their protocol is super strict and that might delay it a couple more weeks."
1294,"I think mid to late January is a safe bet

\- Novavax finished their 15,000 participants enrolment in the UK and they should be giving results soon since their protocol is not as strict and they're looking at infections 7 days after the second dose, not 14."
1295,"So maybe we get some readout this month, but the safest bet is early to mid February

\- The Oxford US study stopped enrolling for three weeks but they started on August 28th."
1296,Their protocol is not nearly as strict as Oxford.
1297,Enrollment is not finished while Oxford is.
1298,"Maybe this one will be released early to mid February, but I'm hoping for January."
1299,\- CureVac might have a readout sooner than expected (April/May) due to the crazy numbers Europe is going to have in the next few months (although these might be mitigated due to home lockdowns like the one in the UK).
1300,"I'm betting on early to mid March, three months after the beginning of their phase III trial

&amp;#x200B;

So there's a chance there could be another 3 vaccines approved before May though I don't think the US will need CureVac given how many doses Moderna is supplying them with

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\-"
1301,It's already here
1302,Everyone who gets a Moderna vaccine is someone who doesn't need a traditional vaccine.
1303,Worrying about Tesla availability in the Third World is especially pointless when there is a plentiful supply of Toyota Vioses.
1304,"Sure, it'd be better if everyone had access to Moderna but distributing supply to the richer world isn't taking away what poorer countries' infrastructure allows them to get."
1305,"If equity stands in the way of maximizing utility from vaccines, it's unethical to prioritize it over effectiveness."
1306,"HK here, I think we got the news around mid/late- January, somewhat close to CNY, I remember I'm the few who were already wearing a mask ( kudos to my mom here ), and my classmates were like "" oH nO yOu gOt ThE cHiNa viRUs."
1307,""", which admittedly is kind of funny, after that my family(and my extended family ) would go to Taiwan for CNY."
1308,"Arrived at Taiwan, some guy had a party before tested positive, the HK government announced that school is canceled, and the trip became family members trying to buy what's left of the available masks, hand sanitizer, etc."
1309,The real reason that Australia was late to the gun and have not been able to secure more than 5.8 million doses ‚Äúin early 2021‚Äù and then an unspecified date for the 50 million doses needed.
1310,"Beloved it or not, that‚Äôs what has happened."
1311,Dozens of countries and the EU have approved vaccines.
1312,Does Australia think their have better safety control when it comes to vaccines?
1313,It‚Äôs bullshit.
1314,They are late because they backed one horse at the beginning and now they are last in line.
1315,"We had to put patients in outpatient, minor surgery areas, and OR recovery units."
1316,There's not a place they could go that isn't packed with patients here.
1317,"Also, we aren't allowing visitors."
1318,Are these people family?
1319,People always needed to check in and get a pass.
1320,"""vaccine resistance"" does not exist in the same sence as antibiotics resistance, the possible problem of delaing the second dose would be more in the long term immunity"
1321,"If a virus has a high lethality rate it spread as fast, thats why SARS never became as widespread as covid"
1322,This can be a major turning point in this entire fiasco and somehow around this time last year news was trickling in about human to human transmissible of coronavirus while previously it was being widely believed that the virus was not human to human transmissible .
1323,Being 33 in the UK with no health problems I'll be last in line to be offered the vaccine.
1324,I'd happily pay ¬£500 to get it today.
1325,Why of America the dumbest fucking nation on earth?
1326,The CDC is collecting this information through an app called V-Safe.
1327,It‚Äôs smartphone based.
1328,Yet the first people we give the vaccine to are 85 year olds.
1329,Or suggest to politicians that they visit most of the countries in the world to see how they deal with covid19.
1330,"I don't expect that to educate the politicians, but they should get any lethal variant first :D"
1331,Get $500 to be a human guinea pig.
1332,What could go wrong?
1333,What are you one about - Australia had supply contracts with four companies by November last year.
1334,"https://www.health.gov.au/ministers/the-hon-greg-hunt-mp/media/australia-secures-a-further-50-million-doses-of-covid-19-vaccine


Australia is going through a provisional full approval process of the various vaccines as our situation doesn't warrant an emergency approval."
1335,"https://theconversation.com/should-australians-be-worried-about-waiting-for-a-covid-vaccine-when-the-uk-has-just-approved-pfizers-151287

It's important to highlight that the approval in the UK and the US are emergency approvals and limited to how many can be distributed."
1336,They have not been fully approved for use and thus it's unlikely your average Joe Bloggs off the street will be vaccinated under these approvals.
1337,Hallways are empty because we close the doors and we also can't pack positive patients there.
1338,We would be exposed even more.
1339,We had to get really creative in putting them places.
1340,You‚Äôre describing buildings.
1341,What‚Äôs lacking is trained staff.
1342,We built temporary hospitals in the UK but there weren‚Äôt enough medics to staff them.
1343,If they hadn't done P3 then the number of people refusing the vaccine would be much much higher.
1344,This is correct.
1345,But we started.
1346,You'll be fine
1347,another tactic is to force concentration of asymptotic patients inside a gym instead of letting them stay at home.
1348,This would help eliminate community spread.
1349,"In this way, China only had some cluster cases but never super-spreader cases."
1350,Dentists is a perfect example of a profession that you want vaccinated very early.
1351,"Very close personal contact with many patients per day with no mask, visits to the dentist can often be delayed by months but no years so very soon you want people to start visiting them safely as soon as possible."
1352,Also [over 30000 people](http://www.op.nysed.gov/prof/dent/dentcounts.htm) licensed as dentists or dental assistants in NYS so not that small a group.
1353,Wait until the mass homelessness hits.
1354,I‚Äôm not sure I understand your thinking.
1355,Are you saying the FDA should allow the vaccine to be used in a way it wasn‚Äôt approved for in the hopes that it will impact the spread?
1356,"Maybe that thinking works in other countries, but I can give you a dozen reasons why that‚Äôs a terrible approach for America."
1357,The first thing to understand about the American mind is that we tend to look after ourselves and our own first.
1358,You can see this is mask usage.
1359,"Some of us will ‚Äúwear a mask for others‚Äù, but mask usage messaging would have been a lot more effective if emphasis had been placed on ‚Äúwear a mask for self protection.‚Äù

Next, efficacy."
1360,"People here generally get the flu vaccine to protect themselves, not other people."
1361,The low efficacy flu vaccine means we generally don‚Äôt bother.
1362,I myself have skipped flu vaccines some years (not this year) because I didn‚Äôt want my arm to hurt at the gym.
1363,I never considered getting a shot to ensure I would at least be less sick so as to protect old people.
1364,"If these vaccines are seen as some kind of watered down rogue experiment on the American people, you can watch your vaccine compliance rate drop through the floor."
1365,I know some people that are only willing to take a risk on a Pfizer of Moderna shot *because* it is so effective.
1366,"They know they will be interacting with masses of unvaccinated people, so a low efficacy vaccine isn‚Äôt worth the risk to them."
1367,It doesn‚Äôt give them their individual lives back.
1368,"I sincerely hope the incoming administration understands the ways America is distinctly.. well, American."
1369,"Nurse's are the schrodinger's medical professionals, they exist in a state of either qualified or unqualified to give their opinion until they are viewed to observe whether they are anti-vax or not."
1370,"Or, we'll at least write it out in our minds."
1371,And you can't force him to endanger himself by hanging out with you and your dangerous choices.
1372,"&gt;Both Britain and South Africa have detected new, more transmissible  variants of the COVID-19-causing virus in recent weeks that have driven a  surge in cases."
1373,British Health Secretary Matt Hancock said on Monday he  was now very worried about the variant identified in South Africa.
1374,"&gt;  
&gt;Simon  Clarke, an associate professor in cellular microbiology at the  University of Reading, said that while both variants had some new  features in common, the one found in South Africa ‚Äúhas a number  additional mutations ‚Ä¶ which are concerning.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;He said these included more extensive alterations to a key  part of the virus known as the spike protein ‚Äî which the virus uses to  infect human cells ‚Äî and ‚Äúmay make the virus less susceptible to the  immune response triggered by the vaccines.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;Scientists including BioNTech CEO Ugur Sahin and John Bell, Regius  Professor of Medicine at the University of Oxford, have said they are  testing the vaccines against the new variants and say they could make  any required tweaks in around six weeks."
1375,Agreed.
1376,"Sorry, that's nonsense."
1377,I took my daughter in for some vaccines a few weeks ago.
1378,We had the same monitoring requirement (i.e.
1379,we weren't allowed to leave for 20 minutes after the vaccines).
1380,The nurse didn't stay in the room with us.
1381,She went about her business and then came in 20 minutes later and gave us the ok to leave.
1382,There's no reason recipients of this vaccine couldn't wait in a waiting room with a dozen other adults.
1383,"I got It Sunday, and now my shoulder feels like it's exploding, so I kinda get it."
1384,"Yes, there's a lack of empathy all around."
1385,The people refusing to take easy steps to prevent spreading covid who cause lock downs to go longer because the cases aren't going down thus more people to die are the same as the people doing everything they can to stop the spread.
1386,Definitely lots of empathy from the people killing retail workers for not allowing them in without a mask.
1387,No empathy on either side!
1388,From what I understand it is relatively easy to modify the current vaccine to adapt to any mutations that come up in the future.
1389,At least that's what the vaccine manufacturers are telling us.
1390,It's much harder though to get people to take the vaccine than it is to actually make it.
1391,You sound like my brother.
1392,"Doug, is this you?"
1393,Lol.
1394,"The feds can issue guidance (which they have, through the CDC) but states are free to do as they please."
1395,The labyrinthine tier systems in most states are state level decisions.
1396,Trump and his administration had nothing to do with it
1397,Send a form through the mail?
1398,"Ultimately it's your body and your choice, however there has been only about 30 allergic reactions reported out of the 5 million doses administrated worldwide."
1399,"If you decide against vaccination, you would have to discuss it with your father, if he decides he doesn't want you to visit, that's his right too."
1400,I don't know why i got so many downvotes when i deal with anxiety and dont want the vaccine.
1401,"Recommend reading this Twitter thread: [A serious reasoning error that is particularly common among educated people is to argue that if a study hasn't been done on a particular question we have 'no data', and therefore no basis on which to form beliefs or act."
1402,](https://twitter.com/robertwiblin/status/1345800480144945152)
1403,Because there‚Äôs very little chance it‚Äôll render the vaccines completely ineffective.
1404,The media just likes to throw fear porn at us.
1405,We polled employees too and sent those numbers to the state.
1406,The state managed the distribution and assigned quantities.
1407,There appears to be no logic behind the quantity we received.
1408,Flu is a lot different that Coronaviruses.
1409,"The strains that are given in the flu shot are different each year, but not new."
1410,"""...tried to destroy""."
1411,There was no try.

1413,Why doesn't the headline reflect that?

1429,"No, M4A would fix everything."

1477,Big events like that were some of the only things I looked forward to in life and now they‚Äôre not happening anymore.
1478,"I‚Äôm gonna assume it‚Äôs the same entity that will
Be clawing the vaccine back if unused."
1479,They are more obsessed with making sure no one gets the vaccine out of turn more than getting as many vaccinated as possible
1480,I was able to get the Moderna vaccine through work yesterday.
1481,No immediate reaction.
1482,Have some arm pain that started about 4 hrs afterwards but that's expected.
1483,Slight nausea started this morning but other than that I'm fine.
1484,2nd dose scheduled for Feb 1st.
1485,They don't have to be armed when assisting in the vaccination process.
1486,This IMO is one of the big issues with trying to vaccinate ‚Äúessential or frontline workers‚Äù.
1487,Those need verification and the lines can get blurry.
1488,"Eg obviously a doctor needs it, but does the hospital janitor need it?"
1489,Does the pharmaceutical sales rep need it?
1490,Does maintenance crew for the HVAC and plumbing systems need it?
1491,"Etc, you get the point."
1492,Tbh same thing with ‚Äúcomorbidites‚Äù.
1493,"Again, obviously a cancer patient undergoing chemo needs it."
1494,How bout the guy who had chemo 5 years ago?
1495,"How bout the person who‚Äôs obese, how bout slightly overweight?"
1496,"The only group priority that can be done easily is by age group, it‚Äôs as simple as checking an ID for a birthdate."
1497,It‚Äôs either do that or just open it up to anyone as you said.
1498,"You know, you‚Äôre right, my speculation on the justification is also a string of words that could have been speckled onto a bathroom stall."
1499,"My point is that a long argument starting with ‚Äúif the concern is‚Äù blah blah, should just end there."
1500,The article certainly did not go far in explaining it.
1501,[removed]
1502,if you fire everyone who doesn't want the vaccine you can't take care of patients.
1503,Staffing is bad as it is.
1504,State authorization.
1505,State decisions.
1506,"And there are people that are losing everything they have worked for,  the question is, should I go homeless to help save people?"
1507,Does the government have that right?
1508,"Pay me what I earn per month and I will comply with all restrictions and get the vaccine , otherwise  this whole were in this together feel good bullshit is being carried on the backs of the poor."
1509,He only wants your soul...
1510,The reason this is news.. is because some countries are considering not sticking to this and vaccinating twice as many people rather than give half as many two shots.
1511,Their thinking is that some protection to more people is better than full protection to half that number
1512,No.
1513,You don't need some massive federal database.
1514,The people you're trying to vaccinate WORK AT THE HOSPITAL.
1515,"So I'm not from California, but I do use google."
1516,"[Please inform me if this is an out of date plan](https://covid19.ca.gov/vaccines/), but every single phase after Phase 1A has a set of age groups that can be vaccinated."
1517,"1B Tier One: Individuals 75 and older

1B Tier Two:  Individuals 65 -74 years of age

1C: Individuals 50 -64 years of age"
1518,I hope you stop hating yourself soon - might stop you posting dumb shit comments on reddit for attention.
1519,because americans have a fetish for the army and patriotism and hollywood banks on that and thus inspires more impressionable desperate young men and women to join the army.
1520,Can we also debunk the misconception that nurses explaining science means nothing?
1521,"Oh wait, that only applies to feeble minded idiots."
1522,"Same thing happened in Monterrey, Mexico."
1523,"A kitchen installer got it from an ""influencer"" who kept his positive status secret, thus resulting in the installer getting sick and dying from complications."
1524,"Of course the ""influencer"" denies it but everyone is talking about it."
1525,Late spring to early fall is a *massive* difference.
1526,spring I can hang on until.
1527,Fall?
1528,I‚Äôll do my best but I can‚Äôt in good faith make any promises that I‚Äôll make it to see the ‚Äúafter times‚Äù.
1529,I‚Äôve been trying very hard lately to take care of myself.
1530,To do it right.
1531,To eat better and sleep more efficiently and stay distracted and not check the news so much and cope with the fact that my friendships have mostly dissolved and exercise and not drink too much or self medicate in other ways.
1532,I‚Äôve been journaling and logging and planning and meditating and fuck.
1533,I‚Äôm trying.
1534,But a month swing is like getting to the end of a marathon and being told you still have 10 miles to go.
1535,are you saying if they wore masks it would be okay?
1536,That‚Äôs crazy in the US ranks as one of the faster ones for administering vaccines
1537,if the variant hits... the death toll will get a lot worse
1538,That's fucking unreal.
1539,That's an insane number.
1540,I fucking hate war.
1541,What if it's a groundhog year?
1542,Any word on bushfires in Australia..?
1543,"""I have a bad back."""
1544,I did state in my question that i dont want to lie.
1545,But he can't force me to put something in my body that i don't want or am skeptical of.
1546,I just don't want a reaction.
1547,"&gt;Now, perhaps I've missed something earlier, but does someone actually know why these vaccines have not been used yet?"
1548,"Is it a staffing issue, scheduling, or something else?"
1549,This article doesn't seem to mention it.
1550,"It's a little bit of scheduling, a little bit of lack of urgency and a little bit of just the difficulty of getting every person within a particular group."
1551,Some hospital employees can't get the vaccine because they need to be sure they won't be on call for 48 hours in case they have an adverse reaction.
1552,Some don't want it at all.
1553,Some just haven't found the time to get it yet.
1554,"In any case, it's easy to see how a hospital would only have given out 30% if they need to hold back an extra dose."
1555,Bigger problem is to start production from square one after adapting to the new variant and produce enough quantities for the entire world.
1556,"This is the same news as yesterday, just with a more editorialize title."
1557,You don't transport some one in cardiac arrest anyways because you can't do very good cpr while flying down the road.
1558,The only thing new is when you fail to resuscitate them you call the coroner instead of hauling them into the ER to be declared dead there.
1559,FML this sub eats up bad news like it's fucking candy.
1560,There are a bunch of stories already on the nursing and medical subs about non-covid deaths happening because the hospitals are over run.
1561,"Stroke patients being transferred hundreds of miles to find a bed, heart attack patients dying while waiting, etc."
1562,The collapse is already happening.
1563,I‚Äôd imagine the us being so physically big is part of the issue.
1564,Distribution over our distances isn‚Äôt a small thing.
1565,Actually he ***did*** sorta say that.
1566,"He said that if moms in developing countries had assurance their babies would survive, they would have ***fewer*** babies, hence reducing the population."
1567,"Just like my father was one of nine (pre-vaccine and pre-antibiotic) , he and my mom wanted four, and my sister and I wanted one or two."
1568,Found him!
1569,"The guy who is so confident in his own situation that he has no empathy, no understanding that bad shit happens to people all day every day regardless of if they are like him or not like him."
1570,Sorry if you feel I‚Äôm belittling the pandemic.
1571,That‚Äôs not what I meant.
1572,I think this article is creating hysteria about something that‚Äôs actually very reasonable given the circumstances.
1573,"Yes, this is a terrible situation."
1574,"No, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair for this headline to make it out like people are being left to die on the streets."
1575,These people are attended to for 20 minutes and have absolutely minimal chance of survival.
1576,Don‚Äôt tell me to shut up.
1577,Seems like all you want to hear is overblown panic.
1578,People don't understand that hospitals were understaffed BEFORE  covid.
1579,We need to mobilize the national guard in every state.
1580,Set up tents and bang this out.
1581,Why in God's name we expect a currently collapsing healthcare infrastructure to take this on is absolutely beyond me.
1582,There's no essential workers that will be around the town centre.
1583,It's a shitty area.
1584,"Mostly made up of charity shops, betting shops, and fast food chains."
1585,The council offices are across the road - the staff have been sent home.
1586,"A bank is up the road, the staff have been sent home (has an atm outside you can put deposits into using your card, so no need for staff to be in store) 

The job centre is round the corner, staff have been sent home."
1587,"The only shops open are Mcdonalds, Greggs and us."
1588,Our store is usually pulling in thousands of pounds a day.
1589,We rarely get past ¬£200 a day right now.
1590,"Maybe 3 UberEats orders a day, and thats generous."
1591,The people who ARE coming in are the types of people you don't want coming in.
1592,"Refusing to wear masks, coming in big groups, ""not worried about the virus"" which is why they're all out and about."
1593,Theres no reason for us to be open right now.
1594,It's all to line the CEOS pockets while he sits at home and risks nothing.
1595,Covid deniers have insisted that kids can't spread the disease for months despite a huge amount of evidence to the contrary.
1596,They were the most vocal about schools and insisted that there was no issue with opening schools.
1597,"Unfortunately, the squeaky wheel gets the grease."
1598,That's how you end up with the braindead policy you mentioned.
1599,The vaccination process should be available 24/7 to anyone who wants it.
1600,This is why we pay trillions to the military.
1601,"Vaccines are getting rolled out, it‚Äôs just states that aren‚Äôt doing anything."
1602,It‚Äôs like states forgot that they were supposed to actually govern instead of pawn stuff off on DC.
1603,"Each state is supposed to act like a country, but that‚Äôs not happening."
1604,blue livers tend to disparage the black lives matter... since covid hitting blacks and browns harder than whites..... their hypocrisy isn't what it appears....
1605,"It's normal really, my boss is in hospital after his entire family got Covid yet he still came to work claiming he's probably had it already."
1606,People don't give a fuck until someone they know dies.
1607,Cool.
1608,"He can quit his job and you'll pay all his bills, right?"
1609,"If not, time for you to keep your mouth shut."
1610,This is just statistically false... Do you just make shit up that fits your narrative?
1611,"Yeah, I cringed when I heard it called that."
1612,"This is why don't fucking elect people from TV shows, and in twenty years add Instagram and tiktok to that list of unelectables."
1613,Now it is the husband's duty to take care of her.
1614,It would be a bad idea to divorce him.
1615,The hospitals have never been overrun.
1616,"If they were, all the field hospitals would still be up."
1617,They are not.
1618,Which still doesn't change the fact that it's two different variations of Covid-19
1619,I believe losing 100k people is within society‚Äôs risk tolerance.
1620,"I think there was a flu year with 60-80k deaths, and I do not believe flu is like the upper bound of risk tolerance."
1621,Masks end when hospital capacity is no longer threatened.
1622,1/8th impulse.
1623,"Sadly, such a true statement."
1624,I‚Äôll toss my hat in that ring too.
1625,"Hehe, most people wouldn't know how to find a library"
1626,That‚Äôs what a lot who are refusing are saying.
1627,That they‚Äôll take it later after seeing more data
1628,"‚ÄúEverything I do is a job, but I don‚Äôt get a paycheck.‚Äù  

Btw, thanks for this little nugget."
1629,This is my life too &amp; I‚Äôd be a lot less stressed out if I could remember that raising 3 kids &amp; managing a house (and caring for elderly family members) is basically a job with no pay.
1630,I go through so much of my life feeling like a slacker :-/
1631,"The point of social distancing, shelter in place orders, wearing masks, and everything else; was to prevent our health care system from collapsing"
1632,No one worth listening to calls it the China virus.
1633,&gt;Public Health England said there was currently no evidence to suggest COVID-19 vaccines would not protect against the mutated virus variants.
1634,Britain‚Äôs health ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
1635,These are by-far my least favorite headlines.
1636,Total fear porn.
1637,"They actually don't know if it will protect or not, they're just concerned."
1638,Of course they are.
1639,"This is like when they say ""New York prepares for worst surge in cases yet."""
1640,"It doesn't mean they expect to have their worst surge, they're just preparing in case there happened to be one."
1641,But it's clear they want you to read the headline and think that the vaccines won't work so they can get clicks.
1642,"According to the article, the vaccines would probably still work, just possibly not as well."
1643,Even that part they don't know.
1644,I assume we would be seeing droves of reinfections if this variant was totally immune to the effects of the vaccine and antibodies.
1645,Trump is not holding this up.
1646,The incompetent state-level health departments are responsible for the logjams you mentioned.
1647,And offering it to healthcare workers first has created more problems.
1648,People are refusing it and the hospitals have opted to hoard supply rather than move down the list.
1649,Still would not want those odds
1650,"That‚Äôs where available resources comes in - once it becomes apparent that we don‚Äôt have even close to enough staff/beds/material to treat everyone then it‚Äôs not just a case of having to wait your turn, you won‚Äôt get treated all all - that‚Äôs when they start making hard calls about who doesn‚Äôt get treated."
1651,I have read it many times and looked up every word I don't know.
1652,What I'm about to say may seem disrespectful but it seems to me you're not using logic.
1653,"Why are they ""constructing genomes from a large number of (short- or long-) DNA fragments"" using de novo which literally means ""from the beginning; anew"" if they already have the virus."
1654,"Put another way, let's take the classic picture of the SARS-CoV-2 virus."
1655,"It's an RNA strand of about 30,000 bp inside a spherical protein shell."
1656,"If they have that virus, why do they need to construct anew?"
1657,If they don't have that virus then how do they know what they constructed is that virus?
1658,The information from Poland is sparse but anything I've read over the past months was absolutely brutal.
1659,They have the fewest nurses per capita in Europe afaik.
1660,Yesterday Die Zeit had an article about a hospital where patients have to share oxygen masks and it's even worse for those ventilators (hope this is the right term).
1661,Politicians are useless or even harmful.
1662,Hospitals were overwhelmed to the point that people were packed in hallways and ambulances were send away from hospitals.
1663,And the numbers apparently can't be trusted.
1664,We don‚Äôt need everyone vaccinated though.
1665,If we vaccinate the most vulnerable at risk (which we can definitely do in a couple months at most) then we will see deaths and hospitalisations fall off a cliff.
1666,"This can't be true, i have friends on Facebook who told me the hospitals are empty."
1667,They need to just loosen the restrictions.
1668,If you can't get 975 health workers in a small town then just vaccinate the elderly too.
1669,"And not only has there been no evidence of being able to do a million a day, but given that two doses are required per person, just doing the math that only gets to about 40% of the population by fall."
1670,Indeed it's really bad in some parts of the UK.
1671,Better than he deserves tbh.
1672,I understand the vaccine was tested and released for a maximum interval of 42 days.
1673,Do you have a source for 2-3 months being superior?
1674,They were once capable of logic.
1675,"Then they learnt they could choose reality, and it's so much more comfy to live that way."
1676,This sub overvalues masks extremely much.
1677,"They are good, but they are far from the most effective weapon against the pandemic, which should be very clear to everyone at this point."
1678,Maybe.
1679,"It still would likely protect against severe disease, which is the most important benefit of the vaccine."
1680,The vaccine will probably also still reduce infectiousness but maybe by less.
1681,All this needs to be demonstrated of course.
1682,"If you were attempting to use English, you couldn't have made a better comment."
1683," How does J&amp;J clinical data for phase II compares to that of Pfizer, Oxford and Moderna?"
1684,"Im talking about antibody titers, protection in macaques and all that."
1685,"Rich people don't really care, they are usually quite pragmatic since they have better exposure to different things."
1686,"Peasants that are constantly fed with garbage info from mass media are like that though, they live in echo chambers and it's more or less the same around the world."
1687,[removed]
1688,"Fauci does not control what people do, should do, or ultimately not do."
1689,He does not control the virus.
1690,He does not set the end game.
1691,Why is this so hard to fathom?
1692,He doesn't move the goal posts.
1693,"The goals posts are moved based on situation, period."
1694,"If a new virus variant proves that vaccines aren't effective against them and needs another six months of development, so the ""goal posts"" move again, will you blame him?"
1695,"It's his fault the ""goal posts"" moved then right?"
1696,Do I have this right?

1704,"See the problem with applying that to the UK is that we have a much larger population to deal with, meaning it is much harder to give a clear message to everyone."
1705,"We have a lot more population centres than Finland and then many towns with sizable populations surrounding them, so to give a clear message to certain areas is hugely problematic in the first place."
1706,"So the only real answer when it gets this bad is to do a national lockdown like they have, and have now clearly laid out the rules for everyone in the country."
1707,"However, this still doesn't address the issue of people ignoring the government."
1708,"Anecdotally, I have friends that got together for new years, even though we are in a tier 4 county which was the highest tier."
1709,I have friends from work that have been getting together for gatherings even though the government has been very clear on not mixing households indoors.
1710,Everyone is fed up at the moment and a large portion of the population have given up.
1711,This then raises the problem of policing the lockdown.
1712,"Unless there are police stopping every car on the street, it will be very hard to enforce."
1713,"So really at this point it's damned if you do, damned if you don't."
1714,"This national lockdown should hopefully reduce the cases broadly, as many people will follow the restrictions, however its not going to be as effective as people expect."
1715,its all propaganda

1721,than a regular person.
1722,"Idk if I'm being clear, english isn't my first language."
1723,Leaders?
1724,You mean the terrorist Soleimani?
1725,"&gt; Soleimani was popular among many Iranians, with many viewing him as a ""selfless hero fighting Iran's enemies"", while others deemed him a ""murderer""."
1726,Soleimani was personally sanctioned by the United Nations and the European Union and was designated as a terrorist by the United States in 2005.
1727,"Well the issue with the people in nursing homes is they are not always able to make such a decision (dementia), so in that case, they have to ask a relative, and have medical green light from a doctor to make sure they can receive a vaccine (some medical conditions do not allow it)."
1728,"I find it reassuring that we are doing things this way, especially when you see Boris Jonhson giving only one of the two doses to as many people as he can as fast as he can (a flashy way to achieve nothing, if they don't get the second shot in time, the vaccine's effect isn't garanteed)"

1790,I want some of that deceptive juice this dude is drinking!
1791,Here's a helpful fact.
1792,"At the rate of vax in the US, it will take 4 years to vax the country."
1793,"If they figure out how to double that rate (sure), it will take 2 years to vax the country."
1794,"It's subrosa, mentioned by Fauci obliquely, as they don't want to freak out the cattle here."
1795,"In the UK, with 50 million, it will take 8 months if the vax system runs 365, and the vaccine is available."
1796,"At best, it will take 4-5 months, if started right now."
1797,"Translated, for the next 3 months, it will be no man's land vis a vis the virus."
1798,"And then for 1 to 2 months, there still won't be herd immunity."
1799,"That's 5 months at best, best, best."
1800,And 8 months to 10 months if including failures in the vax distribution process.
1801,Best to you.
1802,"Pfft... depraved indifference maybe, manslaughter tops... 3-5 with time off for good behavior."

1808,*
1809,Are there even 174 employees at Costco?
1810,That sounds like literally everyone... which maybe it is.
1811,States have had time since this disease resulted in international lockdowns to plan for an eventual vaccine and create deployment plans.
1812,We didn't know when vaccines would be available but we knew they would eventually be created.
1813,But look at the national response.
1814,I'm seeing a pattern here.
1815,"Florida, if you put that idiot back in charge you need help."
1816,He did everything he shouldn't and didn't do anything he should.
1817,But the real question is what changed between Sunday evening and Monday?
1818,Why didn‚Äôt he do it a day earlier unless the pressure of the devolved governments doing it got to him
1819,&gt;  and previous infections with SARS-1 or other coronaviruses can even fend off reinfection or severe cases.
1820,"so you're just talking out your ass, i get it."
1821,I'm used to people like you in my classes.
1822,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2271881/
https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/public-health-now/news/risk-coronavirus-reinfection-remains-after-recovery

2 sources among 100s."
1823,"&gt;I too can make things up and argue them as fact, but in reality the data has shown month after month that infection with COVID does not have short-lived protection against reinfection

I've given you sources, you've given me none."
1824,Coincidence?
1825,I think not.
1826,"&gt;So your argument boils down to ""It could happen

No.... that's not at all what my argument was."
1827,&gt;COVID has been spreading since last year.
1828,Uh huh.
1829,and we didn't have mass tests avalible until the middle of *this* year.
1830,So how would anyone know if they had it last year and then got it again?
1831,What's more.
1832,"VERY FEW PEOPLE HAD IT LAST YEAR


&gt;In this magical valley where there coincidentally are no articles to back up your claims and say nothing about the exact numbers in your town or the cases of reinfection."
1833,"Theres ample articles, you're just ignoring them."
1834,&gt;How stupid do you think people are?
1835,If by people you mean yourself... then quite a bit based on this interaction.
1836,"&gt;According to the research from your county, a whopping ~2% were confirmed to be infected."
1837,"uh huh... you're not proving me wrong or anything, if that's what you think you're doing."
1838,&gt;a whole SIXTEEN PEOPLE would be sick.
1839,"How coincidental that those 16 people seem to consist largely of you and your friends,

So i take it you've never lived in a town of 1500 people."
1840,"You know everyone to some extent, yeah."
1841,First name basis with every grocery clerk and more.
1842,&gt;but thrice!!!!
1843,"One person, who i said i didn't know the details about has been infected 3 times."
1844,one.
1845,"&gt;Wow, and no one has taken the time to publish a single article about this statistical anomaly or comment on it, even in the very article that was written last week about the testing done in your very county."
1846,It's not an anomaly... that's the whole point.
1847,Why are you acting like it is?
1848,"&gt;I read the article, and it contained facts, not fairy tales from a random shmuck who has an agenda to push for some fucking reason."
1849,Maybe you have nothing better to do with your time?
1850,Who knows.
1851,okay guy.
1852,I'm sorry I triggered you.
1853,Trump only got 26% of the vote in LA County.
1854,You shouldn't go around thinking every doctor and nurse knows everything about health related issues.
1855,Do you understand how specialized the various professions are.?
1856,"A random doctor or nurse doesn't have to know anything more about the vaccines than what he needs to know: who should get it, who should not get it, how do I give it."
1857,He probably knows a little bit more because he has an interest in the topic as a health professional.
1858,"And he hopefully knows more than a random moron neighbor with opinions formed on Facebook,  but to be honest, these opinions aren't even worthy of consideration."
1859,But he is is not in any position to make his own claims about for example how safe it is.
1860,He can only repeat other peoples claims.
1861,"And now you are going to say: 

""but he said '...does not know anything ...' "", 

and then I say: ""look at the context, and you see it isn't meant literally""

..so we can just skip that part of the debate."
1862,"Social media, your in-group."
1863,We all cling to biases and some of us compartmentalize contradicting beliefs even more.
1864,"I worked with an md/phd student who told me he thought many medical ailments were just demon possession, and that evolution wasn't real."
1865,We worked on antibiotic resistant bacteria.
1866,"He was extremely religious, which had always been a feature of his life, and he wasn't letting any of those old beliefs (and by extension, his community) go."
1867,"Spreading capitalism and democracy through ‚ÄúFreedomvirus-19‚Ñ¢Ô∏è‚Äù, as God intended."
1868,At the same time in France 5 million people had the jab for the seasonal flu.
1869,There is something strange going on.
1870,These people aren't mentally challenged.
1871,A great many of them are clearly capable of logic in contexts completely unrelated to politics or conspiracy.
1872,"I think these people get some sort of validation for all of this, similar to religion."
1873,"Get something, someone to be angry at, especially if it's a group they don't belong to."
1874,"They are told nothing is their fault, etc."
1875,"And the deeper and crazier it gets, the more resilient they get to facts and logic because facing reality becomes much and much scarier."
1876,Not even remotely wealthy.
1877,My husband has his own welding business and fortunately his career hasn't been hit hard by the pandemic.
1878,So me working from home I am legit the caretaker and home maker and homeschool teacher.
1879,Manage bills and make sure they're paid on time.
1880,Everything I do is basically a job but I don't get a paycheck.
1881,But I recognize the privilege I have to be able to stay at home at all.
1882,Yes we are struggling but we are safe and healthy..so I'll take it.
1883,[removed]
1884,I am in Arizona and it's bad here.
1885,I have known two people that died and it seems people really don't care.
1886,Over the week all I do anymore is take the kids out fishing away from people and go hiking on seldom used trails with the family.
1887,We have groceries delivered and just relax.
1888,On a side note we have abandoned any type of materialism from before.
1889,Since we stopped purchasing so much and going out to dinner.
1890,This has been replaced with cooked family meals and our wallets have gotten a lot better.
1891,"We have spent a few hundred bucks on steam though since March, but the kids and I play together so ..."
1892,I don't think we are going back to the way it was before with eating out and shopping
1893,"At least in America, they have to admit you into a hospital regardless of your financial state."
1894,"In some country, third world...   you get injured, if you don't have the money to pay, they kick you out of the hospital."
1895,But Healthcare is so expensive and so complicated that it would bankrupt you.
1896,It makes me wish the Dunning-Kruger effect was explained at the start of post-secondary classes.
1897,"As far as medical expertise goes, I know the only smart choice for me is to defer to someone else's knowledge, but important part for me is to sort out the good science and the polished bullshit."
1898,"Unfortunately, the fact even medical professionals can become batshit crazy covid deniers shows we need to be diligent about the information we accept even in professional environments, not just online."
1899,That's the issue.
1900,It's not that these people are stupid.
1901,It's much more about wilful ignorance to support a worldview they've developed and cultivated through the use of Social Media.
1902,"Many of these people are perfectly capable of critical thought, logic, and reason."
1903,They've created an alternate reality for themselves and only use those abilities to conform to that reality.
1904,That's why the whole issue is so much bigger scarier than just a lack of education or it only being limited to stupid people.
1905,"We have an entire segment of our population that chooses not to live in a reality confined by objective facts, which is truly scary because objective facts are the underpinnings of reality."
1906,This is actually top on Biden‚Äôs list once he gets in office.
1907,He plans on creating a database to help roll out vaccines.
1908,"So, I guess it just depends on the president."
1909,Isn‚Äôt California a democratic state?
1910,"Let‚Äôs put blame where it belongs, on the individual."
1911,This anti mask can no longer be blamed on anything but personal ignorance.
1912,Both New York and California residents had large parties for the holidays and both are mostly democratic states.
1913,Let‚Äôs just stop using politics at this point and start putting the blame on the individual person.
1914,"There has been about 4000 variants recorded, only one (the ""mink mutation"") have proven a decrease in antibody effectiveness, by about 15%, and did not affect immune cells at all, scientists specifically said it's not a concern for vaccines."
1915,"So empirically speaking, the odds of decreased antibody effectiveness is 1/4000, the odds of vaccines being rendered ineffective is 0/4000."
1916,Soon Activision will have Call of Duty: Covid edition for the Next Gen consoles
1917,"More importantly, don't meet people and stay the fuck away from others whenever possible."

1992,"Directives constantly changes, so do Health ministry."
1993,"Big emphasis is given to people who constantly refer to the Covid as a cold or mild flu, including politicians, show stars, and 'professionals'."
1994,"People started to believe in it, and disregard the threat."

2013,"This article is basically about him refuting something the WHO posted on social media on March 28, 2020."
2014,Well yes it is but that's because of insufficient planning.
2015,"Local authorities didn't seem to understand how quickly vaccines would arrive and what a massive undertaking it is, including not only the jab itself but also admin work on the back end and getting the right arms and needles into the same room at the right time."
2016,They have been winging it where they should understand/run the numbers and get all stakeholders involved up front.
2017,It's in part because this kind of project is outside of their core competence.
2018,One could almost say city councils or health authorities should have hired experienced professional project managers to plan and organize it.
2019,wow.
2020,This is all kinds of screwed up and takes Jury Duty to another level...

2023,"If we can't force the frontline to take it, the other people who will interact with them need to be vaccinated."
2024,"We need to start offering the vaccine more broadly, say to everyone 70 or older."
2025,We shouldn't delay the rollout of the vaccine just because some health care providers don't want it.
2026,True.
2027,Churches and community centers would work then.
2028,I‚Äôm just saying we have the man power.

2035,It‚Äôs not the norm
2036,What this gotta do with us lol
2037,"Even the CDC advises waiting 15 *minutes*, which itself is inadequate."
2038,The allergist tells us to observe our children for 24 hours after exposure to an allergen and they haven't even had anaphylaxis so far (expressed with vomit in one and hives in another).
2039,They take no chances with allergies because we don't know much about allergies or reactions.

2049,I understand that they've been working on mRNA vaccines for as long as 15 years.
2050,So the vaccine itself isn't new technology because of Covid-19.
2051,It's just the first time they had to use it in a Pandemic.
2052,And Covid itself isn't new.
2053,This virus is.

2081,They estimate for various scenarios of supply shortages and different protection levels from a single dose.
2082,And only in the scenario of a complete supply breakdown and zero protection at 6 weeks would you be worse off than a flexible dosing schedule.
2083,"So with the mutated strain, it's one of those things where an abundance of caution might be pretty reckless."
2084,Too me it seems like theater to hide the fact that the roll out has been so slow.

2226,Partially agree.
2227,The priority list should just be simplified right now to anyone over 65 and healthcare workers or anyone over 80 and healthcare workers depending on how limited supplies may be.
2228,And having it done through booking an appointment via mobile or giving the option to allow them to call in that way even the elderly who aren't particularly tech savy can just call their local hospital.
2229,Healthcare workers can just book it online and the elderly call in.
2230,And care homes could then just call in or book online for their elderly residents booked in for vaccinations.
2231,But opening it for everyone right now wouldn't be the best idea since supplies are still limited and our first priority should be reducing hospitalisations/deaths and then we can move onto reducing cases
2232,"&gt; as fast as possible

So who is processing 330 million forms?"
2233,"We don't have any kind of bureaucracy capable of handling that, as almost everything at the state and local level is underfunded."

2247,"&gt; That's crazy, and all their deaths basically happened during the second wave, in the first they were few...

Our government got extremely lucky with the first lockdown that stopped the first wave and then wasted whole spring and summer doing nothing to prepare the country for the second wave."

2305,I think this because it will play into our Psyches as Americans about not letting someone else get something before you.
2306,We are pretty selfish assholes if I'm gonna be honest.
2307,The only thing is we have to put some kind of queuing in place via mobile app/appt or whatever so we can still ration doses (read as not running out of 2nd injections) and to prevent waiting together in large groups.
2308,"For instance, set up a vaccine clinic at a sports stadium and make everyone wait in parking lot until there turn at a respective station set up across the grounds of the facility."

2323,Yeah it stands to reason a more traditional vaccine is less risky by virtue of being produced with a process that is time tested.
2324,This doesn't mean mRNA tech is more dangerous just simply that there are more unknowns due to lack of long term data.

2353,"Apparently, the French health minister also ditched the waiting period:

&gt;Regarding the slow consent system for Ehpad residents, V√©ran said that the vaccination could be now be administered immediately upon consent during the first and now only appointment, without having to wait for a reflection period of several days."

2431,!
2432,I didn't elaborate my comment but will do so here.
2433,Here goes..
2434,It's a different situation with increasing involvement of a different virus now.
2435,One could therefore argue that trials that were done several months ago are less relevant now.
2436,"More specifically;

1. the situation is now more urgent if you take into account the new variants (on top of the explosion in case numbers anyway) and a faster roll-out is needed."
2437,2.
2438,"At the molecular level, given that there are now new variants that can bind to host cells with higher affinity, there has presumably been a change in one or more epitope motifs on the spike."
2439,"(this second point is perhaps more pertinent to your comment above)

To address the first point, you made the remark about it being best to use the vaccine ""as designed"" which I guess you mean ""as trialled""."
2440,The 3 week interval between doses in the Pfizer trial for example is in fact quite arbitrary.
2441,"Most of the immunity is in fact derived from the first dose, the second dose is the optimising dose and Pfizer are now sifting through the Phase 3 data to see if they can put a precise figure on just how effective the vaccine is with the first dose alone."
2442,"(Higher efficacy will likely result from delaying the second dose longer than 3 weeks, but I digress..)


To address the second point, the data re."
2443,efficacy from several months ago may not be so relevant now.
2444,"Pfizer, Moderna and AZ are probably OK though because these all use the whole spike as the antigen."
2445,"In light of new variants though, there will be more concern around subunit vaccines like Novovax."
2446,What might work best though is a broader coverage of antigens that could result from using a combination of different spike vaccines (e.g.
2447,"first jab AZ, second jab Pfizer)."
2448,There is a strong rationale for this but there has been no formal testing as there has been no collaboration between manufacturers.
2449,"I suspect we'll be hearing more about mixing vaccines throughout the course of the 2021 but evidently, this will not come from FDA."
2450,"Sorry for long post, I hope I am clear this time but getting very late here in Sydney.."
2451,Especially when your risk of dieing as healthy dude in your 20s or even having symptomps is extremely fucking low.
2452,Several governments of the world massively failed in the handling of this pandemic but still expect you to work your ass of daily while they keep making everything worse.
2453,I get why we are doing this and why there is a need for it.
2454,But I won't call someone out for meeting up with friends for new years that are just a 5 minute car ride away.
2455,Neither are these super spreaders nor are they irresponsible.
2456,"It's pretty good, especially as nearly 1/4 of over 80s have received it."
2457,"I believe that's only first dose though, so another few weeks until second dose."
2458,Good progress but we need to ramp it up soon
2459,Considering it is the Pfizer vaccine yes.
2460,Oxford vaccine will speed things up.
2461,"Vaccination programme will start ramping up soon, it‚Äôs always bound to start slowly unless you have a very loose process or small population."
2462,By the time you send the text to the next group the vaccines is already bad.
2463,It‚Äôs 6 hours thawed.
2464,"The problem right now isn‚Äôt so much supply constraint from vaccine side, it‚Äôs supply constraints on the administration and distribution side."
2465,"Hopefully as Moderna comes more on line that will be less of an issue, because distribution can become more distal to ULT storage facilities."
2466,"I am ‚Äúpeople‚Äù, and I would give half my emergency fund to get a partially effective vaccine this week instead of waiting three to five months."
2467,"I don‚Äôt have the luxury of working at home, and have several risk factors."
2468,Many of my coworkers and family members are in the same position.
2469,We lost my 50 year old cousin to it last week.
2470,It is more than slightly enraging to see the reported percentages of vaccine used versus unused in my state.
2471,"If Moderna or Pfizer were having trouble meeting production or shipping targets I would understand the caution, and be less disheartened, but they‚Äôre not."
2472,My state is acting like they‚Äôll never get another shipment and must thoroughly consider each individual dose released.
2473,We have administered 25% of our 400k doses on hand.
2474,That‚Äôs disgraceful.
2475,"Even if they wanted to be super cautious and reserve the second dose stockpile, that‚Äôs 100k doses that should already be in somebody‚Äôs arm."

2483,So you are betting your next paycheck that 2 out of every 100 employees are being denied the opportunity to get vaccinated.
2484,Damn hopefully Oxford can speed this up a bit
2485,"Ah, great commentary."
2486,I love your sourcing!
2487,Our speed on vaccinating people has accelerated throughout this process.

2753,"&gt;EDIT: after looking into it further (you can imagine how difficult it is right now to search vaccine efficacy given that almost all the results will be discussions regarding COVID), CDC claims fully MMR vaccinated people are ""much less likely to spread"" the disease and if you do contract it after vaccination the symptoms are ""milder and clear faster"" than when unvaccinated people."
2754,I think your edit gets to the crux of the point (sorry if pointing out the obvious).
2755,"It seems like that vaccinated people are less likely to spread the virus - the question is ""how much less likely""?"
2756,"In the short term, it's a pretty moot point."
2757,People who've recovered from COVID also have some immunity to the disease and are probably less likely to spread it.

2760,"I mean, yeah, people might be potential vectors, whether they have had COVID or recovered and whether they've had a vaccine or not, but the risk of any individual interaction giving you COVID is small."

3285,Prison.
3286,"What a unique though, I bet you're completely alone in thinking that."
3287,"If all these vaccines get rolling, people being vaccinated daily, what would the situation be looking like around April/May time?"
3288,Truth.
3289,It‚Äôs just how Western propaganda works and it works really well.
3290,"‚ÄúA Wisconsin pharmacist convinced the world was ‚Äòcrashing down‚Äô told police he tried to ruin hundreds of doses of coronavirus vaccine because he believed the shots would mutate people‚Äôs DNA, according to court documents released Monday.‚Äù

Boy, I don‚Äôt know... Mutated DNA sounds kinda bitchin to me."
3291,Hit me up with twenty shots.
3292,And?
3293,Some people are dehydrated.
3294,That doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs good to stick a fire hose up to them like this sub advocates for.
3295,I read earlier that the SA variant might have enough change in spike proteins with one of them being an antibody escape that could make it troublesome for vaccines.
3296,"So from what I gather that‚Äôs concerning, but I‚Äôm by no means an expert and I don‚Äôt know why an antibody escape would be a problem."
3297,If someone would like to explain though I‚Äôm all ears.
3298,The Range is a medium sized store that sells basically everything except clothes.
3299,"Lights, curtains, mirrors, garden stuff, plants, sewing materials, kitchen stuff, tools, pet food and accessories, cleaning stuff, JML type items, hobby stuff for arts and crafts, Xmas stuff, BBQs, furniture... All sorts."

3314,Israel will need it as the Pfizer vaccines are expected to run out around Jan 10th.
3315,From then on its only a second dose for people who received the first one.
3316,Because their desire to be a victim overpowers any logic or critical thinking.
3317,They so desperately want to believe that they're under attack so they create threats that don't actually exist.
3318,It helps to justify their shitty behavior.
3319,"I'm not 'waiting' for anything, I'd get the shot right now, but I will feel more confident in the vaccines efficacy once I see case numbers and deaths going down across the board."
3320,"I think a lot of people are looking for that same kind of concrete evidence, and I don't think that's unreasonable."
3321,Do all viruses change your DNA?
3322,No.
3323,"The vast majority of viruses only hijack the host cells‚Äô metabolism to produce their own materials, rather than altering the DNA blueprint in the cell nucleus."
3324,"However, a few viruses can alter the host genetic codes, causing even bigger problems."
3325,One notorious example is HIV.
3326,"HIV is a retrovirus, which reverse transcribes the viral RNA into a piece of DNA and incorporates into the host chromosome."
3327,"Once incorporated, the viral DNA (aka provirus) becomes a permanent part of the host cells, which is why HIV is incurable and patients need to take ARV for the rest of their lives."
3328,"Another infamous one is HPV, which is a small DNA virus."
3329,"Although HPV doesn‚Äôt encode an integrase (which inserts the viral DNA into the chromosome) like HIV, the viral DNA are often mistakenly incorporated into the chromosome by host chromosome repair mechanisms."
3330,"What‚Äôs worse is the viral DNA encodes two small proteins E6 and E7, both of which can potently stimulate the cell growth (i.e., cancers)."
3331,"Nearly 100% of cervical cancer cases are associated with HPV infections, of which 80% harbor at least one copy of incorporated viral DNA."
3332,"Besides HPV many other DNA viruses like herpes viruses and adenoviruses also infect human, yet it‚Äôs unknown whether these viruses also incorporate to the host chromosomes, and whether such incorporations are consequential (i.e., oncogenic potential)."
3333,Of the least concern are RNA viruses (excluding retroviruses) and poxviruses.
3334,"The reason is that RNA viruses use RdRp to replicate, which doesn‚Äôt generate any DNA intermediates, hence possessing zero integration risk."
3335,"Although poxviruses are large DNA viruses, these viruses are unusual as they replicate in the cytoplasm instead of the cell nucleus like most DNA viruses."
3336,"Because poxviruses never enter the nucleus, the chance of integration is nonexistent."
3337,"Due to their extremely low genotoxicity, RNA viruses like VSV and alphaviruses and poxviruses are very promising vaccine platforms."
3338,The newly approved Ebola vaccine Ervebo is an engineered VSV expressing the Ebola glycoproteins (EBOV-GO).
3339,"Live-vectored vaccines against other deadly viruses like Lassa, Nipah and coronaviruses are under active development."
3340,"With that said, people have been false positive for HIV after covid vaccination."
3341,"So, because
1."
3342,"I don't know and 
2. there are puzzle pieces on the table,

 how about we get someone who actually understands how the vaccine works to help me understand."
3343,"(which, from my admittedly limited research is exactly 0 people)"
3344,"It's not as bad as it sounds, it's actually a good thing."
3345,These people have effectively no chance of survival so it's better not to waste ems and hospital resources transporting them
3346,My sister tested positive a few weeks ago with very mild symptoms.
3347,My mom (who lives with her) lost her sense of taste around the same time and got much worse symptoms.

3359,You could also work rural after residency and live in a city.
3360,My husband does that as a hospitalist.
3361,We're in a rust belt city that has high paying high demand rural salaries 30 minutes outside the city.
3362,That‚Äôs not true at all.
3363,Vaccinations are happening on weekends.
3364,"Nope, that's 100% proven to be not safe."
3365,"It's harder than a regular flu vaccine, someone explained it, it's trickier to store and measure out and dispense and that's not including monitoring afterward."
3366,"Though it seems to be a logistics problem and not a staffing shortage, there are people who have volunteered to help (either paid or sometimes unpaid), people with medical and vaccination dispensing experience, but they haven't been effectively used yet."
3367,"That's great and all, but I've seen enough people get transferred from the ICU just to come back a few days later and getting reintubated and paralyzed/sedated."
3368,Yup!
3369,I agree.
3370,Until they‚Äôve been vaccinated (which should be summer maybe?)
3371,we should continue to wear masks because we can pass it to older people.
3372,"I just hate how much *long term effects* have been, in my eyes (and in the eyes of data and articles such as above) overblown in order to frighten younger people into staying compliant."
3373,"They should stay compliant, for the reasons you state - because the elderly are at a serious risk."
3374,But I don‚Äôt know if the risk of long term effects warrants the attention it‚Äôs getting - at least from a frequency perspective.
3375,But it‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs go to argument about why we should remain compliant .....

3379,"It's a great big, waving red flag that our government has been ignoring for a minimum of forty years."
3380,"We need a system that takes care of all members, for the benefit of all members."
3381,The problem in the US is that our lawmakers aren't members.
3382,I‚Äôve been trying to explain this to people for months.
3383,Yes the death rate right now is not all that high.
3384,However if a hospital is packed to the brim and unable to treat patients the death toll will **soar**.
3385,The wests public school systems are run by average people placed into a bureocracy that combines their efforts to produce pure chaos and stupidity.

3388,Jesus christ what's wrong with you?
3389,Most places are doing that.
3390,We are even trying to tap into nursing schools to pick up students and teachers... and all that is a drop in the bucket.
3391,A day or two pause in vaccination isn't a big deal in the grand scheme of things.
3392,It is a big deal to the healthcare workers who have been working overtime since March.
3393,Can‚Äôt blame the millennials on this one.
3394,"That is not a normal body process that happens, HIV is able to do this to its RNA because it has an enzyme called ‚Äúreverse transcriptase‚Äù (yes, it is called that because it allows for the reverse reaction of transcription to occur)."
3395,"We also frequently use reverse transcriptase in the lab to convert RNA into DNA for various purposes, including the standard ‚ÄúRT‚Äù-PCR tests that we use to test for Covid-19."
3396,"Without that enzyme RNA cannot be converted into DNA and even, theoretically, if it were possible there would be no way for it to then get into our nucleus (this requires a nuclear localization signal to be attached to the RNA) or once there integrate with our chromosomes and change our DNA (this requires a protein called integrase)."
3397,The reason why we have been able to treat HIV with drugs it it has so many unique enzymes that are necessary for its lifecycle and we can inhibit.
3398,"I know ranitidine isn't available anymore- I'm almost out, but I got a one year prescription."

3407,"‚ÄúDoomery‚Äù is very different from pointing out, accurately, that the UK is the only country that has decided to disregard manufacturers‚Äô advice on dosage regimens in favor of a different regimen designed solely by regulators for the government‚Äôs convenience."
3408,We have processes in place to require data driven decisions on medication because the fundamental principle of medicine is to do no harm.
3409,"We do not know if the UK‚Äôs current plan will do harm, but there are very real risks;  some scientists have warned that a population with partial immunity could be the perfect conditions for creating vaccine resistant COVID-19 strains, as one concrete risk."
3410,Is there a strong chance that eventually the data will support the decision being made here?
3411,Yes.
3412,Does it currently support the decision?
3413,Absolutely not.
3414,"The UK has a bad historical track record of approving therapies prematurely (thalidomide, a long time ago, and Pandemrix, very recently, are two examples)."

3416,"Well that‚Äôs the difference between a lockdown and restrictions, in my opinion."
3417,They affect people differently because they really only target specific things and risk tolerance levels.
3418,"I am feeling the restrictions, strongly."
3419,"The whole nature of my job has changed, for one, and I can‚Äôt meet up with friends like I would have before."
3420,"I don‚Äôt have kids though, and I‚Äôm pretty solitary to begin with, so I probably don‚Äôt feel them nearly as heavily as you do."
3421,"As for restaurants, I tended to order more delivery anyway."
3422,"The difference is that that option isn‚Äôt gone, and we‚Äôre still allowed to eat out if we‚Äôre willing to take that risk."
3423,"All in all I just feel like lockdown isn‚Äôt the correct word to describe the state of South Korea at the moment, and this is the strongest the restrictions have been so far."

3430,Pharmacology programs are actually very competitive.
3431,They did but are fixing it for the next round (at least in lee county) by making them call a phone line for an appointment until they run out of vaccines.
3432,It is a crap way to distribute them because demand is so much higher than supply but at least the supply isn't sitting on a shelf somewhere
3433,Thank you.

3477,The pandemic wasn't endemic nor do they have the same population density as NY or London.
3478,"That's not to say lockdowns, masks and distancing don't work, they surely do to an extent but the rate at which the virus is slowed down depends on the virus, people's compliance and density, not everywhere it's possible to do what they managed, perhaps even with the exact same measures if they had delayed 2 weeks at the beginning the results would have been completely different"
3479,"There's not enough, but currently it's more of a deployment problem than a supply problem."

3583,"The ones I love die, everyone else‚Äôs loved ones die, I can‚Äôt travel, I can‚Äôt see my friends, I have to be careful 24/7 for everyone‚Äôs sake every day all day."
3584,My job requires it and I feel this obligation to know this the best.
3585,Then you get a piece of bait- a conspiracy theory against the government.
3586,Maybe I don‚Äôt believe it at first but then temptation sits in.
3587,"Hmm, you know I don‚Äôt really trust the government all that much."
3588,Politicians are slimy and untrustworthy.
3589,"And, oh, what‚Äôs this?"
3590,If they‚Äôre right millions of people are being slaughtered for their own personal gains?
3591,Well... maybe I‚Äôll entertain the thought.
3592,"And maybe at first you say ‚ÄúHuh, they don‚Äôt seem to have any hard evidence‚Äù, but you‚Äôre hit with what if?"
3593,What if?
3594,What if?
3595,What if I am wrong and all along everyone I know is dying because I didn‚Äôt see it?
3596,It keeps you up at night and stresses you out.
3597,Maybe it‚Äôs the thought of labeling all pillaging the government for being crooked.
3598,It hooks you on and feels like an addiction at this point.
3599,Maybe you dip down once in awhile but the burning questions of possible regret surface your mind and compel you forward into oblivion.
3600,It doesn‚Äôt help that others recruit you as well.
3601,They tell you over and over about how wrong this is.
3602,And they give you a sense of community as well.
3603,They‚Äôll praise you for accepting such ‚Äúforbidden‚Äù knowledge to save the people.
3604,You have someone who shares the same mistrust and anxiety at the thought of this being a ruse for the rich and powerful to become even more rich and powerful.
3605,More importantly you can convince them to meet up with you and connect.
3606,"Finally after months of self isolation and worrying so long about the health and safety of everyone around you, you can take a break."
3607,"You gain back human contact and connection, something you might have been so deprived of and felt on the verge of insanity without it."
3608,"There‚Äôs no more fear, anxiety, emergency testing, or lonely nights."
3609,"You know everything will be okay after these terrible, terrible months into this pandemic."
3610,Then you get your ego boosts for the narcissistic people (which are a bit higher in healthcare).
3611,You feel like you‚Äôve bested a majority of people with accepting this conspiracy and that you can become a hero by preventing these vaccines.
3612,"Imagine the people you would save, but more importantly how you‚Äôll be praised and worshiped for saving so many lives!"
3613,"These people just don‚Äôt see that they‚Äôre wrong yet, but you‚Äôll be gracious and help them."
3614,Just without telling them.
3615,Just one small ‚Äúmishap‚Äù and I will have saved 250 + lives!

3637,CDC needs a huge lab (bigger than what exists now) that does genome sequencing and other basic science.
3638,And fund university labs to do these things to.

3640,That's so backwards.

3654,Everytime a bill comes up to try and increase the protection for 401k it is killed.

3784,Most hospitals lose money on the inpatient admissions.
3785,The hospitals make the majority of their money on outpatient procedures and surgery.
3786,Most hospitals have reduced or stopped elective surgery so profitability is down.
3787,Most hospitals work on a fine line for sustainability esp if it is a community or rural hospital.
3788,"So even though you would think a full hospital is making money, most likely they are working at a net loss esp since insurance payments are likely being delayed by at least 6 mths to a year."

3814,"After about two months I realized it was going into, ""I should talk to someone about this"" territory."

3879,i like the overscheduling though but i'm not sure how many people can effectively get off work twice.
3880,"aside from that, my big question is why didn't the government already have a plan for mass vaccination?"
3881,shouldn't that have been in the playbook?
3882,"seems like they should announce to the whole country via text, ads, news, etc etc for anyone who wants the vaccine (or is required to get it) to contact their local health department to determine which phase they are."
3883,"so joe bob calls in, they decide he's phase 2.1a and number 12 among them, betty sue calls in and she's phase 3.2b and number 95 among them, etc etc."
3884,"then when they get 100 vaccines, the first 100 people on the combined lists get a call to show up tomorrow."
3885,"anyone who doesn't call back to confirm their reservation stays in their spot in line but the next person gets called, plus a certain number of voluntary alternates."
3886,"someone who is ""work from home"" who lives close or someone who is willing to wait every day if needed for the call, whatever."
3887,"if they want to use CVS, walgreens, etc etc they can still use the same master list but numbers 101-200  at the time go to CVS that day and 201-300 to walgreens, etc etc and the alternate list can overlap somewhat as long as the locations are close."
3888,then i'd say they should only defrost vaccines if there is a corresponding body in line that day.
3889,they planned to vaccinate 100 but only 80 are in line then only defrost 20 vials and then break open the rest when you're halfway through if more people have shown up.

3895,And they aren't even sure the vaccine did it because they developed bells at the same rate the general population does.
3896,"I did, but they were outdoor in recycled soil so there was only so much I could do; and these were unknown genetics, mystery bag seed my neighbor threw to me over the fence and I decided to grow out at the last minute so they didn't go in the ground until June."

3911,"Probably a dumb question, but is it possible to catch the new strain if I already had the presumably old COVID strain last month?"
3912,üôÑ so it went from beginning of 2021 to spring to summer to now fall?
3913,This guy...
3914,I‚Äôve used Pok√©mon Go to ground myself during an intense trip.

3917,"With the dengue stuff, note that they said ""in vitro""."
3918,They can get it to work in a lab.
3919,But at least at first glance they're still doing studies (or doing so recently like [this one](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30452439/).
3920,A university in Thailand is doing [a clinical trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02045069) and I don't see that they have results yet.

3925,Time to force these nitwits back to reality.

3927,"South African doctors are also (anecdotally) reporting that a larger proportion of younger patients with no co-morbidities are presenting with critical illness, so it's possible that it is more infectious and more deadly to youth (a la 1918 second wave)."

3946,"A lot of places in the US currently are in lock down (""stay at home order""), such as LA."
3947,"Compliance is much lower than in spring, though."
3948,This is so wrong and makes no sense.
3949,"We are already at 350K, so to hit 500K in 1 month we will need to have 5,000 deaths everyday for a whole month."
3950,What a silly fear mongering article
3951,"The article is on a popular gay lifestyle/gossip site, seems relevant to them i guess."
3952,Did you actually read the quotes in these articles?
3953,They're highly conditional.
3954,"Return to normal in summer 2020 was ""if we do the things that we need to do to prevent the resurgence"" and ""identify, isolate, contact, trace,"" to avoid future spikes""....And, guess what, we did *none* of that."
3955,"To use your parent and toy analogy, if the kid asks if they can have a new toy this weekend, and the parent says ""Yes, if you keep your room clean all week, and remember to feed the dog, and have all your homework done""...and the kid does absolutely *none* of that...well, no shit there's no toy, but maybe next weekend if you do your chores this week."
3956,"First of all, he was not the one who leaked the information,  his colleagues are the ones who found it but you don\`t even care about them because they are still alive."
3957,"On the other hand, China announced the pandemic and locked down 60 million people on January 23rd."
3958,"Isn\`t it early enough for you to ""save lives""?"
3959,"Look at what America had down last year, I don\`t think it may make any difference even if they announced the pandemic one month earlier."
3960,Amazing.
3961,I hope to god the real world results are as good as the trials.
3962,We‚Äôre never gonna hear the end of it if a bunch of these folks get Covid
3963,Yesterday there was a post regarding how well New Zealand is doing and one NZ comment was to the effect of the nation‚Äôs leaders realized that it‚Äôs really difficult to maintain a manageable level of infections through flattening the curve and upon that realization the national strategy pivoted to elimination.
3964,"If we look at other countries that beat the virus and are out of lockdown, for example China/Taiwan/NZ/Vietnam/AUS, it‚Äôs clear that the only strategy that works is elimination."
3965,Unfortunately I just don‚Äôt see the US doing a hard 6 months lock down like Australia to get to elimination phase.
3966,It‚Äôs super frustrating to say the least.
3967,So... isn‚Äôt the right thing to say ‚ÄúTake vitamin d if your doctor tells you to‚Äù?

3971,"https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/

This gives more US specific and global data."
3972,"TLDR: Canada has less vaccinated per capital then the US, but also has way less total vaccine doses by now, which was kinda unavoidable."
3973,"We could, and should be vaccinating faster."
3974,"But I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any real cause for concern, as long as we can role our larger shipments of vaccines quicker once we get them."
3975,The news coverage of the rollout has been very exaggerated in my opinion.
3976,"As you can see from the link above, vaccine distribution has been ramping up, to the point where we‚Äôre likely to get through all delivered doses in the next 1-2 weeks."
3977,"We maybe should have been quicker from the start, but the vaccines we have are a tiny fraction of the ones we‚Äôll get over the next several months, and that distribution matter a lot more."
3978,"This is going to take time, and there‚Äôs probably gonna be a lot of big negative headlines in the next few months that are ultimately not super meaningful."
3979,I think this is one of them.
3980,Why?
3981,What does the source have to do with the story?
3982,Why does a website about gay lifestyle bother you?
3983,Are you homophobic?
3984,I don't get it.
3985,"Have you ever heard the expression that someone""knows enough to be dangerous""?"
3986,That's where this professional level hesitancy comes from.
3987,They know that there's no long term studies and side effects could show up years later.
3988,"This puts a shadow of doubt in their mind and without a way to remove 100% of that doubt they will continue to fear things like bell's palsy, Stephens Johnson's Syndrome or other serious side effects coming from this."
3989,"If that many people have had it, Doesn't that mean the chance of death is even lower than what's being reported?"
3990,Yep people warned us we might be in Quarantine for atleast 12 to 18 months back in March!
3991,[removed]
3992,We have had a flatline number of daily Covid infections for a month now as some States have already entered the ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù stage.
3993,"Overall as a nation we have 40% of Americans who have been infected or are infected with the virus, and that percentage is going up at a pace of 10% per month now."
3994,Can‚Äôt continue like this for many more weeks.
3995,"It is truly tragic that we could not have held off the pandemic for a couple months longer and instead decided to ‚Äúsacrifice‚Äù 600,000 Americans so people could go to bars and churches sans mask."
3996,You're really exaggerating.
3997,Taking a small supplement isn't eating away....
3998,"Now its kill someone because someone might have a better chance, or not who knows."
3999,That's an extremely bold claim without anything to back it up...

4002,Take care of yourself!
4003,Meanwhile there are millions out there still spreading the virus!!!

4007,They don't argue if this is a hoax or control or what.
4008,"As long as we can save one human life, even from the usual bloody seasonal flu, we must do whatever it takes."

4011,"I don‚Äôt ask to be snarky, I genuinely do not know.... what is best solution?"
4012,"We've had ""working positives"" and it's like a badge of honor to them."
4013,"I don't know if I've had it or not, and the possibility of lurking heart damage or inflammation (or any of the other underlying stuff) worries me so much."
4014,Everything in moderation
4015,"Same (if they let me in, I'm in Canada)."
4016,"Florida is also trying real hard to doctor their numbers, so you kinda have to shrug at Florida looking like they're doing well and say ""We don't know""."
4017,Until they feel it's safe and see that there are no real side effects with it in the short and medium time.
4018,This is great.
4019,"I just wish we knew what this means in Terms of how long before the virus would not be a threat to this person inoculated with the 2nd dose, how effective is it against stopping the virus, etc."
4020,Lol...so saying people need to take more personal responsibility is letting government off the hook?
4021,How about letting people off the hook?
4022,"People spread viruses, not public policy."
4023,No amount of rules is going to work if people don't listen...
4024,I doubt mask wearing will last until next fall if the high risk groups are vaccinated.
4025,I get what you're saying but if he can't make a statement that he can get behind and support then it's better to not say anything rather than continue getting people's hopes up for a let down.
4026,There's nothing wrong with saying I don't know.
4027,Let's wait and see how the vaccine goes.
4028,"It is easy to criticise with hindsight, and I do feel for the world leaders in a lot of situations."
4029,"However as I have attempted to point out to my Boris supporting family, I never expected him to have all the answers."
4030,The problem is his and many other world leaders talking absolute shit.
4031,"I'm originally from the UK but I work in a VA hospital in the USA studying for my Ph.D. in biomedical sciences, nothing to do with epidemiology or virus research but still close enough to notice things."
4032,In late February/Early March as Boris was on the news spouting shit like 'business as usual' I was in my lab scrambling to find VA staff members equipment they could use to make COVID testing aparatus.
4033,"It clearly was not business as usual, even I knew that, so it becomes really hard for me to believe that Boris, with all the wealth of knowledge actual leaders in the field could offer actually believed that."
4034,"Now an argument can be made for not wanting to cause panic, but the problem is by acting as if things are normal when they quite clearly are nowhere fucking near normal he's begun to put doubt into ANYTHING he or the government says or does, it makes people talk shit like 'the virus is a hoax' 'the vaccine gives you COVID' 'Masks dont work' 'lockdowns are pointless'."
4035,"Would it really have been the hardest thing in the world for him to be transparent from the opening of the pandemic, ""we really don't know how bad this is going to be, but we need to take every possible measure and we ask the public do its duty to help us fight this'."
4036,Instead we have this comedy show of one day saying its all Gucci and the next day full lockdown and the creation of tier 5 lockdowns.
4037,"Its exhausting for a normal person, and causes distrust of scientists who at best are branded harbingers of doom."
4038,Authoritarian craphole
4039,Exactly :/
4040,"If we had an amazing response from the Federal level with bipartisan support for measures, we could have limited the deaths to a couple hundred."
4041,Sadly that did not happen.
4042,"Yeah, it might not slow down but it can‚Äôt keep up hospitalizations if all the high risk groups have been vaccinated."
4043,Not deep state at all.
4044,He admitted in a recent New York Times article to moving the goalposts in order to trick people into following his policy.
4045,Not necessarily true.
4046,I have family members that feel everything that happens is god's plan.

4057,Let this be a lesson  to you in the future
4058,I think it's the beginning of a return to normal?
4059,You can go back out with a mask and be around others with a mask.
4060,And then once enough people are vaccinatied the masks can come off?
4061,I don't know as I'm just guessing here but that's what my guess is.
4062,"You do realize America is more than just the United States, don't you?"
4063,I have worked for multiple different hospitals and never heard of a flu shot or fired rule.
4064,"It‚Äôs always flu shot or sign this waiver, claim a reason and wear a mask between these dates or then risk termination"
4065,Unfair to focus just on provincial though.

4071,Those are things you do with friends FYI.
4072,"I work in pharmacy, many of my colleagues are vaccine hesitant due to not having any clue what the long term effects will be."
4073,Which I get that but this isn't going to go away on its own.
4074,We have to get it done as a society and if there's side effects down the road so be it.
4075,Otherwise it's millions dead.

4088,"There are a wide variety of Christians out there, so I do realize that they might want to support Israel for different reasons."
4089,"But it's my impression that the Venn diagram circles of ""people who wave Israeli flags at American church events"" would have a high overlap with ""people who want Armageddon to come soon because they want to go to heaven without dying""."
4090,The Christians I know who tend to be in more mainline churches fall into neither of those circles.
4091,"One of the things that weirds me out about this sort of ""support"" for Israel (and the reason that I said ""*only* because"" in the previous comment) is that the supporters don't seem to know or care much about Israel as a modern country."
4092,"They care about Israel as a symbol and an abstraction, but it's a real place with real people and with its own politics."
4093,"If you're going to ""support Israel"", which political faction(s) are you supporting?"
4094,"Yeah I mean in the local mom groups of FB you always have tons of people saying this exact thing ""The kids need to be in school"" and they say it in a context as if children cannot and will not thrive without school."

4104,"Firing nurses, MAs and doctors would lead to hospitals closing, and you can‚Äôt just hire new nurses MAs and doctors, there simply isn‚Äôt enough to go around and they can‚Äôt just be hired abs start the next day, they need to file their license Etc."

4114,Some hospital healthcare staff (like my sister!)
4115,have medical issues such that guidelines recommend that they DO NOT get the available vaccine right now.
4116,"A big one is a history of having serious anaphylaxis, like my sister was hospitalized for previously."
4117,She also had covid last March and was fine.
4118,"She‚Äôs hopeful that she‚Äôll be able to get an alternative one like the Oxford vaccine this spring once it is approved, but it‚Äôs not fair to make it black and white -  ‚Äúunvaccinated employees cannot work‚Äù"

4125,"They have been relying on ‚Äúfalse hope‚Äù for months now, but this time I think their predictions might actually hold true."
4126,I think deep down we all know it isn't.
4127,Those at most risk of hospitalisation and death are being prioritised for vaccination.
4128,Vaccinating an 80 year is more impactful than a 25 year old in relieving pressure on hospitals and reducing death rates.
4129,When will the US go back into lockdown?
4130,Looks kind of inevitable in certain areas i.e.
4131,los angelas
4132,"I'm in Europe, and feel pretty confident that all who wants to be vaccinated in western countries will have had the possibility before next autumn."

4510,I Wonder what will people think in 50 years about today.
4511,"And given the amount of burnout, infected staff, staff that have died due to the virus, and those who pulled out of the medical field as a result of the virus."
4512,"We have less staff staff now than then, and they won't be replaced."
4513,We don‚Äôt even need 6 months - give the US 30 - 45 days of NATION WIDE lockdowns using the full might of our military to lock down travel and distribute the vaccine.
4514,The US Military is pretty much the best logistics network in the world and has not been leveraged in the way it should have been.
4515,My mom had already passed away by the time the FD arrived so not even a paramedic was gonna help.
4516,My neighbor with the stroke had the ambulance show about 10 mimutes after the FD showed up.
4517,The FD is only blocks away so maybe thats why they get scrambled first in my neighborhood.
4518,Blame those who spent four years attacking Trump.
4519,Right.. kinda.
4520,"There's never been one in this modern era (ya know, where we really put a value on lives and stuff) that causes the destruction this one does, has there?"
4521,Like how could NFL games for instance ever start if guaranteed 200 (or whatever the number would be) audience members per game would end up hospitalized as a result?
4522,I just don't see that as practical.
4523,Lol you have no clue.
4524,Typically the hospitals have tech staff for a lot of that stuff.
4525,And they‚Äôre  already using nurses from other departments where they can.
4526,Many hospitals still haven‚Äôt stopped elective surgery and procedures.
4527,The real problem is lack of trained ICU nurses.
4528,Covid patients require a lot of skill to handle.
4529,They have tons of tubes and drips and monitors to keep track of...plus the Oxygen/vent.
4530,And a lot of them destabilize on a dime.
4531,All have to be constantly monitored with the knowledge to recognize and solve problems as they come up.
4532,"I understand that we're exhausted from the shut downs, and that no one wants to live their lives shut in forever."
4533,"But just in case it's worth anything - I was a healthy, fit 30 year old with no preexisting conditions until July, when I contracted covid."
4534,"Honestly the initial sickness was shitty but not the worst, but the the after effects continue to majorly affect my life."
4535,"Prior to getting sick, I worked out pretty hard 6x a week."
4536,"Now, I can't do anything that gets my heart up without noticeable chest pains that last into the next day."
4537,"I've also noticed my circulation is jacked - my arms are constantly ""falling asleep"" in the middle of the night no matter how I sleep even when I don't put pressure on them."
4538,"It's not that I want everyone to live in hysteria, but I contracted the virus 6 months ago and frankly I'd be lying if I said I wasn't dealing with some fear of what my future looks like."
4539,And the guilt my spouse lives with for bringing the virus home to me is very real.
4540,He would have quit his job if he knew what it would lead to.
4541,"I don't blame him at all, but I want to share some perspective on some lesser-known ways this can impact you."
4542,Again I know we're so sick of being indoors.
4543,I haven't seen anyone socially since March and it's terrifying to think of having to go another 9 months so isolated.
4544,"But if you're really suffering, you can plan something 'smart' without going into full screw-it-I'm-going-out mode."
4545,"Go for a hike, meet up with a friend 10 feet apart for a bonfire or a movie outside in a backyard or social-distance sledding if you live somewhere cold."
4546,"I'm not telling you all this to make you feel bad about your comment, I'm really not."
4547,I'm telling you this because I really don't want you to get covid.
4548,Perfect so if you are locking down then you know what a lockdown is
4549,"As much as I possibly can while keeping us alive, just like I did this year."
4550,I'll go another 5 if I have to in order to protect those I care about.
4551,"While in my heart I knew this was going to be a long haul, I never truly adapted to the pandemic because I kept thinking of it as a temporary hurdle."
4552,It would have helped me a lot for someone to just lay it out at the start.
4553,"Like, okay, time to get serious about home fitness and give up hope on the gym."
4554,Time to get used to working the night shift in the lab and living like a vampire.
4555,"Time to reach out to friends and family virtually, because I won't be seeing them for a while."
4556,"As a future physician scientist, Fauci is still an inspiration to me, but he also taught me a pretty valuable lesson about hope."

4559,"Fair enough, but they are easier to find, better than surgical masks, and you won't get flak for taking PPE away from nurses."
4560,"A simple glance at the hospital/ICU numbers tells you the UK needed to take serious measures before Christmas, unfortunately, doubly so given the near-certainty at this point that the UK strain is significantly more contagious."
4561,I'm not really convinced the SA strain is a major factor.
4562,"Again, though, this is a possibility that should be investigated."
4563,Why not allow Paramedics to refuse transport for non-emergent patients like San Bernardino County is doing?

4566,"I remember this one...oh shit, no!"
4567,This is the one where Trump wins a second term?
4568,I have to get out of here.
4569,Has anyone seen my towel?
4570,I need my towel back!
4571,Yes 200%that‚Äôs what this virtual campaign is about.
4572,"The UK variant is causing havoc around the globe and they‚Äôre trying to spin it like the Spanish influence, where the reality was that virus originated from a pig farm in Kansas, if my memory is right."
4573,But he has the biggliest words!
4574,"Again, deaths are not the metric by which we should gauge the pandemic."
4575,I agree wholeheartedly that the overall mortality rate is low.
4576,"Very, very, very low for relatively young and healthy people."
4577,What mortality does not tell you is anything about hospitalizations.
4578,That is the number that should frighten us.
4579,We simply do not have the capacity to handle all of the health crises that require critical care AND the pandemic.
4580,"Just because we‚Äôre talking small percentages with regard to covid, it does not convey urgency unless those small numbers are viewed in relation to the number of staffed critical care beds."
4581,"All told, what this means is that a hospital that gets swamped with critical care COVID patients cannot handle - in the same manner as prior to the pandemic - every other instance of people needing critical care."
4582,Quality of care is declining all over the nation.
4583,We can have a mortality rate that is a tiny fraction of a percent and still be in this predicament.
4584,"I have family members who are at risk due to preexisting conditions, but COVID is, honestly, the least of my concerns."
4585,"If my mom has a major stroke tomorrow, the quality of care she will receive will not be the same as a year ago."
4586,"In cases of stroke, small lapses in care can have a huge impact on recovery."
4587,"If, god forbid, my family were in a bad car accident, the same issues would arise."
4588,"If I were to need ICU care, I‚Äôd want a nurse and physician with a normal work load."
4589,"Right now, none of those exist."
4590,"They are understaffed, stressed, and overworked."
4591,And it has nothing to do with the mortality rate.
4592,My aunt and uncle did as well in early December.
4593,"As ordinary, regular, everyday working people - they got positive test results, felt worse the next day, went to the hospital and were both given the Regeneron IV."
4594,"Much better 2-3 days later, and now feeling 100%."
4595,"If anyone is high risk or has a loved one that is, I hope the stories of it being impossible to get the Regeneron cocktail unless you‚Äôre rich don‚Äôt stop them from trying."
4596,"No, fuck the wilfully ignorant."
4597,"Willful ignorance isn't a handicap, a disability, an illness, or anything else over which a person has no control."
4598,The operative word here is *willful.
4599,"*

Like how people who *willfully* chose not to wear masks or socially distance don't deserve priority treatment over those who have been trying their best to be safe."
4600,You don't seem to understand the balance between charity and personal responsibility.
4601,The UK just went into lockdown.
4602,I think they are genuinely concerned that the South African variant could be problematic for the vaccine that they are counting on.
4603,I think their concern is genuine.
4604,"But yes, we need much more information."
4605,"Fun fact, every so and on Mac-Donalds advertise a *french style sandwich* with *reblochon*  or *raclette*  cheese and other things to make it sounds better."
4606,"Even in General, after a farmer union ""*dismounted""*  a Mac-Donalds, they started to market themselves as doing burger with *french meat* and fries with  *french potatoes* and to present themselve as a *quality burger place* which seriously improved their image and sales."
4607,Goes to show you how front line workers really feel about covid.
4608,"In my hospital system with 20k employees, 6k took the vaccine."
4609,From what they have looked at they think relatively the same.
4610,the only concern is if it is more contagious the effect it will have on the hospitals.
4611,[deleted]
4612,Fuck me where did you get that from?
4613,!
4614,Let's not be alarmists!
4615,"It's just 500,000, we got like 600 days worth of people to keep that rate up."

4625,"If we consider they are still ramping up and pretend the 4.6 million was administered in just 10 days, we are on pace to be vaccinated in the US in roughly 6 months."
4626,"But if we look at my slow state of California though, with 2 doses required and pretend 454,000 doses were administered in just 10 days well shit... California is on pace to be 50% 2-dose vaccinated in 2.35 years and theoretically 100% vaccinated in 4.7 years."

4667,"The phase 3 trial consisted of 32,523 people."
4668,"The 95%, from my understanding, is the result of the 8 vaccinated out of 170 positive cases (5%) showing that 5% is ineffective against the covid-positive group (95% effective)."
4669,The problem here is that there‚Äôs no definitive proof that the vaccine is ever 95% effective because such a low sample size of positive tested ppl were used (170/32523 = 0.465%) to determine the efficacy of the vaccine.
4670,"We know that the 32,353 remaining population of the trial were not calculated as part of the efficacy because none of those tested positive."
4671,"If they included them, the effectiveness would be like 99% or so."
4672,"There always have been and always will be viruses, so the only choice now is to stay terrified or to go on living."

4732,"Help, sure."
4733,There's a reason doctors are wearing actual PPE.
4734,The real effect is that people socialize less and go out less in areas with mask mandates.
4735,This most certainly has a dramatic effect on viral spread.
4736,"From the article:

The test is part science and part elementary school arts and crafts."
4737,It involves a card with five unmarked scratch-and-sniff spots on it as well as a QR code.
4738,Test-takers use a smartphone app to scan the QR code.
4739,"Then they scratch the spots and answer multiple-choice questions in the app about what they smelled ‚Äî mint, vanilla, strawberry or other common scents."
4740,There‚Äôs also an option to say you smelled nothing.
4741,"The whole process takes about 45 seconds, at the end of which the app will tell you if you‚Äôve passed or failed."
4742,"Toomre, who grew up in Boulder and went to CU for undergrad, said a dedicated, blind sniff test for coronavirus has significant advantages over just telling people to mind their nose."
4743,"The first is that people who are infected often don‚Äôt realize they‚Äôve lost their sense of smell ‚Äî other studies have found around 45% to 50% of people infected with coronavirus report a loss of smell [when surveyed](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11882-020-00972-y), but that number rises to around 80% when people are actually administered a smell test, Larremore said."
4744,And Toomre said it‚Äôs also important for the test to be blind to avoid tricks of the mind.
4745,"If, for instance, you are used to sticking your nose down into your cup of coffee every morning, your brain might continue smelling that coffee even if your nose can‚Äôt."
4746,"So Toomre said, in order for the test to work best, people can‚Äôt know in advance what they are supposed to be smelling."

4803,What is going to be bad if other countries start reporting negative reaction to the Pfizer or Covena vaccine.
4804,And we know this is going to happen when you give the vaccine to large number of people.
4805,What we need is transparency.
4806,"A daily dashboard on the number of vaccinations, number of adverse reactions, fatalities, etc.."
4807,"Not yet, the vaccine rollout is an unorganized, confusing mess, but im ready &amp; willing."
4808,Ive been amazed though by the lg no of educated health care workers that are refusing to get this..

4815,"I know this might sound a bit harsh but looking from strictly scientific perspective:

-kids will grow with it and acquire natural immunity

-vulnerable can have protecion with vaccines

-we're already @ 30-60% immune by now depends on the country

-there are research papers that state minimum immunity 8 months or 
more"

4873,"I don‚Äôt know for sure how it all works, but -

I‚Äôd guess there‚Äôs a difference between a vaccine that provokes a very strong immune response but is only effective in 50% of people, versus a vaccine that provokes a too-weak but well-targeted response in almost everybody."
4874,"I also think that people were hopeful that we‚Äôd be more effective at keeping case numbers down through non-pharmaceutical interventions before a vaccine was rolled out -

A 50-60% efficacy vaccine might have been fairly effective at cutting this thing off at the knees when we saw confirmed cases dipping to 20-30k per day and still declining during the two low points."
4875,"Unfortunately we‚Äôve decided to add an extra zero to those numbers now, so I‚Äôm not sure that low bar would still be considered adequate."

4889,Because... even doing very quick math it seems very likely that it will go above that.
4890,If this were the case then surely we should also be seeing re-infections here in South Africa ?
4891,We had a pretty large first wave so surely some re-infection would have happened by now if the virus evolved that far.
4892,"But we aren't, the media would have been all over it if even one re-infection took place but I haven't seen any such news (correct me if I am wrong)."
4893,Or is there a fundamental difference in the immunity acquired from previous infection vs vaccine derived immunity ?
4894,"Yes, it is."

4898,"WTF, you think the ability to use a web app is disqualifying?!"
4899,WTF is WRONG with you?
4900,I'm in favor of ANYONE AND EVERYONE GETTING THE VACCINE.
4901,I'm further in favor of acknowledging that some elderly people are not going to be able to use current technology and help them and acknowledge that some of them may need some help.
4902,"You don't seem to know much about the elderly, frankly."

5021,"Reinfection is incredibly unlikely, statistically."
5022,"The amount of confirmed cases of reinfection are absurdly low, and even those cases tend to be more mild than the initial infection."
5023,"The one morbid upside to America's handling of the virus is that, due to how many people have been infected already, we're already a non-negligible step closer to herd immunity due to antibody protection."
5024,"It's also why I'm not quiiiite so worried about delusional anti-vaxxers - most of them were probably flaunting any sort of safety standards anyway, thus making them more likely to have already been infected, thus meaning they are contributing to herd immunity already"
5025,"While the omissions of the government are disturbing, I suspect law enforcement in most countries are able to access most (if not all) data sources with a warrant."

5028,The intent is plain to see.
5029,You have Fauci himself admitting in a recent New York Times article that he has been slowly moving the goalposts to trick people into following his policy decisions of long term lockdown.
5030,"That is, you have him admitting to dealing with the people dishonestly and misleading them, always finding a new reason to stretch this out further and further."
5031,"You've got people hanging on his every (vague and indefinite to the point of meaningless) word, who are happy to follow along every time he declares the situation has changed and, drat it all, we need to lock down longer and harder."
5032,And the people go along with it.
5033,How is that not a populace that has been beaten into submission?
5034,Maybe read the last paragraph.
5035,"**My county has .13% active infections out of 300,000+ people living here."
5036,"** Even if you multiply that times 10 (that's what experts say is closer to real infection rate, right?)"
5037,that's about 1.33% of our county's population that has it unconfirmed.
5038,"We weighed the *risk* against current cases and decided that it would be very minimal risk, **in addition** to the fact that the half of our family that actively works outside the home has been tested."
5039,"I am high risk, and if I seriously thought I'd be at risk of dying I wouldn't go as much as it would suck."
5040,"Should we never leave then, even if there's a single case in the area?"
5041,"That's extreme, I'm sorry."
5042,"I could understand if I lived in a hot spot, or somewhere that had a higher case count where there was higher risk but I'm lucky I live in an area that doesn't."
5043,"We even have exposure notification tracking here, as well."
5044,You dont think in few weeks the vaccine will start doing its work?
5045,I literally say it's not published yet.
5046,It also helps prevent you from catching it.
5047,Think about it logically.
5048,It‚Äôs a respiratory virus
5049,"And people are shocked when we get conspiracy theorist doctors, pharmacists, and nurses."
5050,Being a medical student gives people just enough information to think they‚Äôre smart enough to know what they‚Äôre talking about in fields of science they actually know very little about.
5051,Taking all possible precautions and maintaining sobriety is important.
5052,Leave the person alone.
5053,If they are all wearing masks properly and keeping distance they will be fine.
5054,Think flu vaccines.
5055,They are adjusted every year to attack a specific local stain.
5056,The same will essentially be true for covid on a yearly basis.
5057,Where the vaccine could become an annual adjustment based in the popular strain that year.
5058,So it's not like a situation like that isn't unprecedented.
5059,It's just that this is the initial vaccination and we're playing catchup
5060,&gt;Did the second infection felt different for you or your friends?
5061,"For me it was more mild, one of my roomates had it worse second time."
5062,"I don't know details for my friends, just that it happened, also dont know the details of the 3rd infection, just that the lady was sick for a long time march and april, tested clear for may, got sick again in june, was clear till december and positve again."
5063,It's possible that it's not a second infection but a latent one too.

5101,What I have seen is not making it a one dose vaccine but for the general population giving the first dose to as many people who want it before giving the second dose.
5102,As one dose is 70 or 80% effective vs 95% for 2 doses giving only one dose is the fastest way to slow down transmission.

5120,More like punished for reveling they are basically assholes.
5121,perhaps it's worth considering that institutions very rarely perceive the populous as much more than an abstract whole.
5122,there was without a doubt information withheld by several parties along the way intended to mislead when you look at things like the pandemic bond/holders and the extraordinary steps taken by WHO to avoid calling it a pandemic.
5123,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic_Emergency_Financing_Facility

https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/pandemic-bonds%3A-what-the-whos-declaration-means-for-investors-2020-03-12"
5124,That's exactly his point.
5125,Which is wildly stupid and shoddy reporting.
5126,This is the left wing version of ‚Äúlockdowns don‚Äôt work‚Äù.
5127,"I‚Äôm sure the left has the moral high ground here, as they do in almost every public policy issue, but come the f on."
5128,I don't know what that means.
5129,Germany have vaccinated 250k+.
5130,"Here in denmark it's 50k, being almost 1% of the population."
5131,What exactly is france or the netherlands funding compared to germany or denmark?
5132,I don't think i get it.
5133,"The West's ""public school system"" is little more than glorified day care so that it's workers can remain busy making profits for the rich while the rich isolate themselves from the effects and dangers of the disease."
5134,That's Rupert Murdoch media for ya... the guy who owns Fox News in the USA.
5135,Because it hasn't been the same type lockdown since march.
5136,"In march businesses were told to shut, schools and colleges to go online."
5137,When we came out of that lockdown and went into local lockdowns (and then tiers) schools and colleges were allowed to continue to stay open.
5138,Even in November when we had lockdown number 2.
5139,"The issue isn't lockdowns don't work, the issue is our government is too incompetent to act fast enough when we do need to lockdown."
5140,"Now that schools and colleges are closed and online again, you will almost certainly see a reduction in cases."
5141,&gt;JOHANNESBURG -- Scientists in South Africa are urgently testing to see if the vaccines for COVID-19 will be effective against the country's variant virus.
5142,"&gt;‚ÄúThis is the most pressing question facing us right now,‚Äù said Dr. Richard Lessells, an infectious diseases expert who is working on the country's genomic studies of the variant."
5143,"&gt;‚ÄúWe are urgently doing experiments in the laboratory to test the variant,"" against the blood of people with antibodies and against the blood of people who have received vaccines, Lessells told The Associated Press Monday."
5144,"&gt;The tests, called neutralizing assays, will help determine the reliability of vaccines against the variant, he said."
5145,"Yeah hate when that happens to me, been vaccinated for polio 17 times already"
5146,[removed]
5147,Yes but we don‚Äôt have that here in the US.
5148,We can test and diagnose people.
5149,We just don‚Äôt give them money to stay home and not spread the virus.
5150,"Many eu smaller nations at either worries or are perceived by other members as worried, that they will be screwed over in vaccine allotment by the bi boys if they don‚Äôt have total equal deployment per capita to all members

The issue is that it‚Äôs costing lives and also that the big boys are funding a lot of other countries vaccines and that‚Äôs already causing tons of resentment."
5151,It‚Äôs not unreasonable why French voters would be pissed off about them delaying their safety for the percpeption of equality when they are fronting a lot of thebill

5156,*
5157,"&gt;because that will cause the least suffering in the sum

That's a massive logical leap."
5158,We then still have to choose between a global elimination strategy and flattening the curve.
5159,"Both have their pros and cons, but simply letting it rip means failing to treat Covid effectively in the majority of severe cases, because there is no capacity to do so."
5160,We may have effective treatments within months.
5161,"We may be able to eliminate it if we all ""do a Melbourne."""
5162,Both of those options are likely to cause less suffering than letting the virus run rampant and provide it with the test beds to keep evolving new and ever-more resistant strains.
5163,False
5164,Europe is screwed.
5165,"Poland is now blaming their slow rollout on vaccine limitations and they don't have control over how many of them end up in Poland, even if they have purchased enough... blame game goes in circles in Europe and this is why the EU is doomed"
5166,"I am usually advised to just bike and/or walk where I can, or taxi/uber."
5167,"Admittedly, that might not represent as wide of an example of the NY perspective as I might think."
5168,"In reality, when I am in New York, I will just ride the subway to nowhere in particular."
5169,I love it.
5170,"I try to trick myself, briefly, that I belong (which is a delusion I humour a lot when I travel) and just take everything in, especially the views."
5171,"The last time I was there, I stayed in Queens and had the luxury of riding the Queensboro Bridge a bunch of times, and those experiences genuinely stand out as some of my favourite travelling experiences in my 3 decades on earth."
5172,Edit; I deleted that one because it made me feel like a schmuck.
5173,I am too high and overthinking shit haha.

5178,*
5179,Just take a look at UK.
5180,"It's been locked down since March (in some form), yet they nearly have the highest death count per capita."
5181,[removed]
5182,I read it as resuscitative efforts not only that have failed but those *likely* to fail in the field shouldn‚Äôt be returned to the hospital as well as the O2 rationing.
5183,That is the change in protocol that required the update in the memo.
5184,https://i.imgur.com/7PnC1bC.png
5185,Ya won‚Äôt we just be playing whack-a-mole with vaccines for now on if these variants keep coming about?
5186,"Christ, this might be the new normal..."
5187,"Well if there was really a plan to lower the population, a virus killing 1% of the population would not really be enough."
5188,They have some permanent crew - but they are command and engineering to keep the ship running.
5189,"There is no point in keeping the medical staff on board when there is nothing to do, so they don't."
5190,The problem is that at this point the military medics that would normally be assigned to these ships are not available because they are doing other (often still COVID related) work somewhere else.
5191,"It was reported to WHO on Dec 31, 2019, the next working day after it was reported within China."
5192,That doesn't explain why spanish were allowed to travel here freely when their cases were super high and ours in the UK were pretty good.
5193,[removed]
5194,Just wanted to point out the death rate in the US is currently 1.7% in COVID-19 positive patients.
5195,As in **if you've been diagnosed** with COVID-19 you now have a 1.7% chance of dying.
5196,That's not so low in my book.
5197,D√©j√† Vu
5198,[removed]
5199,What?
5200,"In my area if you have a heart attack they take I you to hospital, while giving CPR."
5201,They don‚Äôt turn up try to get your heart going and then leave you there.
5202,Where do you live?
5203,?
5204,Spanish were allowed to travel freely here even when their cases were stupidly high.
5205,I know of 4 spaniards who came here and totally ignored the 14 day isolation because UK is a soft touch.
5206,"it was not a random stranger, it was one of the workers that dressed up."
5207,"Let's be honest, compared to most countries the US is winning when it comes to vaccinations so far."
5208,How is it possibly worse than California right now?
5209,I don‚Äôt understand.
5210,I know of a Rn with a PhD who teaches at a university.
5211,She is a anti-vaxer who spreads misinformation to her students.
5212,They know quite of a lot of people who fit a similar profile so I'm not suprised.
5213,What on earth could you possibly mean?
5214,"How in any capacity, is keeping people away from eachother not going to slow the spread of the disease?"
5215,Is there any explanation for why countries like France have only given out 500 doses in almost 2 weeks?
5216,And Belgium/Netherlands haven't even started yet.
5217,"I don't understand how a government is willing to lockdown, impose curfews and stop people from working and travelling, but then also be so slow and seemingly incompetent when rolling out the vaccine."
5218,These first vaccines are the most important and are the ones that will have the biggest impact in terms of deaths/hospitalizations.
5219,And many EU countries are taking their time for no reason.
5220,"I dont know, if i was told that we were in a perpetual lockdown, but we weren't vaccinating even though we have an approved vaccine while countries like UK/US/Israel have vaccinated millions each, and even other EU countries have started long ago, then i'd be furious."
5221,You should probably go back to school because it doesn‚Äôt change your DNA.
5222,100% fucking fake news.
5223,"Remember when armchair scientists here were swearing up and down that, without a doubt, this vaccine would protect against any other strain that comes about?"
5224,Pepperidge farm remembers.
5225,"Anecdotally on the inverse, my neighbour from my childhood home who, for the record was always a Republican but never among the more extreme cases (the kind of guy that used to lament that the GOP dragged Romney too far right from what he wanted)."
5226,Has totally fallen deeper into the Fox News and now OAN alternate reality.
5227,He was in the hospital for weeks and lost his wife to COVID but still just dismisses it as the Chinese and not worth losing our rights over and Trump did everything he could and it's a states issue but also our governor was right to close nothing and not only not mandate masks but prevent any mask mandates.
5228,Is that what you're doing trying to be my friend?
5229,You do that as good as you argue ü§£.
5230,How on the spectrum are you?
5231,It's ok you can say.
5232,This is a safe space for you
5233,another source says national average is 29%.
5234,It's from professor K. Barb√©.
5235,In Germany there is.
5236,"The reason is probably because of kids not being vaccinated yet, as none of the vaccines are approved for kids/younger teens yet and vaccinated people may still carry the virus."
5237,"So in public and when visiting people with kids or unvaccinateds in their household it‚Äôll probably persist for a bit, but once kids are vaccinated there will probably be no mask mandate anymore, if I had to guess."
5238,US healthcare worker and data nerd here.
5239,"If you think this is the horrific low point, and we‚Äôre turning a corner to see the light of optimism again because it‚Äôs 2021...wrong."
5240,Over 50% of covid-19 patients require a hospital bed for 8 or more days.
5241,"The range is 1-31 days, so some of those occupants would be there a full month."
5242,"Also, about 10% require hospitalization again within a month of discharge."
5243,There are no beds left for anyone.
5244,For any illness.
5245,I‚Äôve seen so many code greens (people left for dead on morphine in hallways because we have no room) at this point I feel like a serial killer.
5246,I‚Äôm fucking numb and that should scare everyone.
5247,neither did the researchers.
5248,With a new disease it can be as easy as chicken pox or as hard as HIV o find a new cure.
5249,"We're lucky it's not as bad as SARS, Marc Van Ranst said if it was as hard as SARS we would still be testing on animals."
5250,"A healthcare hospital, whatever shape it has, is only a hospital if it's staffed by medical personnel."
5251,"You can build one or put up tents wherever you want, but it won't change this."
5252,All you're doing is creating places where people can die away from home.
5253,I see your point.
5254,I've known plenty of people go to university longer than 4 years and are more ignorant than your average joe.
5255,"Dick noses, thank you I know what to call them now!"
5256,Happy cake day pal!
5257,[removed]
5258,Strange to think Finland is in a position in which schools should stay open?
5259,How can people be warry about long term effects of the vaccine and not give any shit about the long term effects of the disease itself?
5260,That makes no sense!
5261,There's no way to cook it well.
5262,It's flavoured chicken with a paper texture.
5263,"&gt; Mechanically Separated Chicken (60%), Beef (20%), Lamb (5%), Beef Fat, Water, Rusk (Wheat Flour, Salt, Anti-caking Agent E535, Raising Agent E503-ii), Wheat Flour, Soya Protein, Salt, Onion, Flavour Enhancer (E621), Stabilisers (E451i, E300), Seasoning (Salt, Onion Powder, Garlic Powder, Spices, Chilli Powder)

Actual doner meat should be mostly lamb."
5264,"I really wish they'd sell kebab meat that was actualy kebab meat, rather than flavoured chicken with a paper texture."
5265,Mom's facebook wall isn't a scientific journal.
5266,That‚Äôs not the health care system.
5267,It‚Äôs the financial system.
5268,There isn‚Äôt support for people who can‚Äôt work.
5269,The curve has been flattened.
5270,Vertically.
5271,Are you british?
5272,You‚Äôd be hard pressed to not know how Cummings is.
5273,And your link shows nothing to contradict what I said.
5274,Regeneron (which contains two different monoclonal antibodies) has been approved for emergency use for Covid-19.
5275,No idea what the cost is.
5276,"Here's the FDA press release: [https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-monoclonal-antibodies-treatment-covid-19](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-monoclonal-antibodies-treatment-covid-19)

And here's a youtube interview with a Doctor who has been administering it to patients already: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN30emwcNS4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN30emwcNS4)

If you just want to skip to [Regeneron, it's at 5:35](https://youtu.be/vN30emwcNS4?t=335)."
5277,"However, I highly recommend watching that entire video."
5278,"In it, Dr. Seheult discusses several important things you can do to improve your odds while at home (vitamin D, melatonin, NAC, vitamin C, Zinc, etc."
5279,).
5280,Both The Range and Iceland are awful.
5281,The Range sells low-end homeware tat.
5282,Iceland sells low-quality frozen food.
5283,The people in charge are probably busy with their famous 5 hour lunches or dinners /s
5284,Sinterklaas is weeks before Santa comes.
5285,The Sinterklaas also was a worker in the eldery home.
5286,So they are still trying to discover how it spread.
5287,just to look at it from another perspective some ppl need to work to be alive themselves.
5288,it's selfish and ultimately the fault for companies not offering pay if you feel sick at x time.
5289,the lack of financial support during the pandemic is horrible both from companies and government.
5290,many ppl live paycheck to paycheck.
5291,I'm not saying what he did is right.
5292,it's just an entire shitshow with no one caring about each other since we are all trying to support ourselves first
5293,When will people realise these lockdowns don't fucking work?
5294,I only seem like a totalitarian to stupid Ameribads.
5295,In civilized countries we recognize that rights have limits and can be abrogated for the good of the collective when there's no good alternative.
5296,What does that even mean lol why would I be scared?
5297,I‚Äôve been racking up the Ws all evening.
5298,"So if I‚Äôm melting, I‚Äôm the butter to your popcorn?"
5299,Weird way to say you need a friend..
5300,That‚Äôs theoretically true- but no evidence to support more vaccinations will happen.
5301,"Before a lot of my friends would meet outside and get takeaway pints and stand outside pub, they will all stop doing that now.. as it's not the same buying a bag of cans from Tesco's"
5302,In the UK TJ Maxx's home section is tiny and naff.
5303,"The Range is 100x bigger, but still naff."
5304,Could it be 900 million doses?
5305,Because two does per person bring us back to where the number needs to be correct.
5306,"Extremely misleading headline, to the point of falsehood."
5307,The directive is to not transport patients for whom resuscitative efforts have failed.
5308,Many if not most ambulance services *already* operate this way.
5309,"There is little to nothing to be gained by transporting these people, they are already dead."
5310,"CPR and ACLS has been performed, same as if they were in the hospital."
5311,112 is no where near enough.
5312,That‚Äôs a minuscule sample size
5313,We're doing pretty well here in India.
5314,"Though since it's extremely likely due to some level of herd immunity, don't think other countries would be eager to follow our plan."
5315,"But whatever be the reason, we're living _with_ covid."
5316,"Restaurants/bars are full, people are going on holidays, holding 200-person (that's the limit) weddings, and... cases are still decreasing every single day."

5325,Is it known if the efficacy varies on different ages?
5326,Wow I didn't know south park spoofing a real person in that episode.
5327,My best friend tested Positive so technically a case correct?
5328,She had no symptoms and wasn't sick.
5329,She didn't die.
5330,So no cases do not equal deaths.
5331,What it equals is a great way to use numbers to scare the fuck out of the population to keep them in line.
5332,Except part of health care is actually physical touching and things like vitals.
5333,Yeah NPR has been doing really soppy soft stories on the facebook group as well.
5334,I get annoyed with them over some content choices semi frequently but those seem like concerning for journalistic integrity or something.
5335,They wouldn't cover a chronic lyme disease support group without putting it into proper context of questionability.
5336,"They were still trying the 'Regional Tiers' approach, which in some cases was effectively large localised lockdowns, however in a small population dense country like this, there is a lot of travel between tiers, and calling it a 'Lockdown' removes a lot of confusion and helps 'get the message across'."
5337,The big change is the closure of schools nationwide.
5338,This is how you shut down a hospital.
5339,[removed]
5340,"That data is cumulative 7 day averages, not 7 day averages."
5341,They're adding in a week's worth of cases together.
5342,Look at the data box.
5343,"England is getting all of 50,000 cases daily and that's stated at the very top of the article, yet the link you gave states there are 300,000 cases daily."
5344,Because that's a cumulative 7 day average you linked to.
5345,I'm saying that both france and belgium are incompetent.
5346,Less than a thousand doses weeks after the vaccine has been approved is criminal.
5347,Literally killing people.

5354,"That's a TV show thing, not a real life thing."
5355,"If they are on the way and code, we will bring them in pumping that chest."
5356,"But if they die at scene, and we get no return of circulation, they die at scene."
5357,That's life and death.
5358,It's how it's always worked.
5359,"And while we do our best in traumatic arrests, the chance of getting that back in field is slim."
5360,This is why news writers should have medical consultants.
5361,The story is that we're conserving O2 on hypoxic patients.
5362,But never have we made our job carting corpses to the ER in hopes of some Grey's Anatomy like turnaround.
5363,That's now how it works.
5364,Welcome to why people are concerned about all this.
5365,"Limited trials, no accountability, brand new tech."
5366,If .1% of people have some unknown side effect 2 years down the road we have no clue what sort of effects it could have on our society.
5367,So far its good science but its rushed and rushed humans can make mistakes.
5368,"Triage has always included making a decision that based on the available resources, some people aren't  worth the time and effort to try and save them when it's obvious there's no hope of doing so."

5376,So you says france started with 500 doses but Belgium has not started with 700 doses ?
5377,Right.
5378,Thats on the individual states for gating it that way.
5379,And for relying on hospitals to do it completely before moving on.
5380,"Yeah, obviously you need the staff too - but it's a lot quicker to fly people in to a place than it is to build the physical facility, even at the highly accelerated rate it was being done there - so the actual facility ended up being the critical path on the plan."
5381,Hoax?
5382,No.
5383,Chinese engineered?
5384,No doubt in my mind.
5385,"Guess what, a large portion of the US population is obese."
5386,"And even then it can potentially have long-term problems that reduce quality of life for months (and hopefully it improves over time, but we're not going to know the years long effects of this until years on)."
5387,I'm really disappointed at how many of my coworkers are holding off.
5388,I got called in to get it during my day off (too much vaccine brought up to room temp) and I was in my car and on my way in within 10 minutes.
5389,"Ok, well it's the same point."
5390,700 people is nothing.
5391,Seems extremely slow.
5392,Food comes from farms.
5393,"I don't know exactly what you mean by property, if you mean houses we currently have enough and this is a ""short term"" thing."
5394,We could build no more houses or cars or cloths in the next 8ish months until we have the virus under control and vaccines widely distributed.
5395,The economy is why people can't stay home.
5396,"Because they have to pay rent, because they have to pay for food, because they have to make payments on loans."
5397,We could put all that shit on pause.

5410,My mom was a nurse for 30 years and while she was a nurse I cannot recall a single day she was sick (I came into the picture about 15 years into her being a nurse).
5411,They are constantly exposed to other corona viruses so its likely they have a bit of built up immunity.
5412,"Not much better, if one of the  mutations has a high lethality rate, the time to tweak the vaccine will be too long."
5413,according to them

Tier 1/2 isn't a lockdown."
5421,If you call opening the universities to students from all over the world a lockdown.
5422,You must be a Tory MP.
5423,I remember the argument last April was that the shielding benefit of having masks was offset by the increased frequency of touching the face if you wore one.
5424,"So, the evidence doesn't support that now, but it wasn't a totally illogical thing to believe."
5425,"Yes, they have idea about:

* length of immunity
* if you can still catch/transmit the virus even if you have the vaccine (you'd of course be asymptomatic or very mild)

Of course, this is how science works."
5426,It takes data and time.
5427,"From what I've read SArS-CoV-1 natural immunity was found to be pile 2-3 years, so that's a place to start guestimating at."
5428,How about the possibility of relapsing?
5429,UK still has big gatherings in airports &amp; train stations.
5430,The rest of those places people keep their distance.
5431,At least during the lockdowns.
5432,"The ""only a monster would cancel christmass"" ignored the fact that covid19 does not have holidays."
5433,People need to stop spreading this idea that it's low IQ or cognitive ability or education that makes peopel fall into this.
5434,"I'm sure there's some correlations, but it seems extremely counterproductive to me to oversimplify it like that."
5435,Because for most people its a flu/cold or nothing.
5436,We have more data about the long term effects of covid than the vaccine and for a huge majority of people COVID doesn't have any long term effects that we have found.
5437,You get sick for a week or two and then have some after effects for a few months and are back to normal.
5438,"We have no data on the effects of the vaccine on pregnancy, fertility and a ton of other factors."
5439,The longest study is 30k people which is a big sample but not enough.
5440,"Anyone who has an above average risk of long term effects or death due to covid should absolutely get the vaccine but if you have already had covid or are at low risk, can socially distance and wear a god damn fucking mask, I would wait and see."
5441,Health care workers who haven't caught it yet somehow should absolutely get it along with the elderly and infirm.
5442,20 year olds who wanna party should get it.
5443,The best part is that opens those people up to live their lives again and lets the rest of us have data we can reasonably base a decision off reassures people further that the vaccine is safe.
5444,I don't think its dangerous but its unproven at this point and needs the people who are unwilling to follow the safety guidelines to test the waters.
5445,Though China did a pretty good job at conrtolling the virus.
5446,Entirely depends on what mask we are talking about.
5447,But even the cheapest one may catch that one droplet that would have infected you.
5448,It's just that it's nowhere near reliable enough to count as valid self protection.
5449,"Still, without proper ventilation in that room, chances are that masks wouldn't have helped much either."
5450,"Not sure if someone dancing around in a costume made it worse, but at least according to the great examples on this [site](https://english.elpais.com/society/2020-10-28/a-room-a-bar-and-a-class-how-the-coronavirus-is-spread-through-the-air.html), the aerosol spread already seems to be pretty random even without it."
5451,"There are religious freedom laws that entitle people to wear the face coverings associated with their beliefs, doesn't mean people didn't act judgy and suspicious towards them."
5452,People would sometimes act alarmed at the site of people wearing surgical masks early in the pandemic.
5453,"A lot of the masks people have lying around aren't outright surgical masks, and they might reach for them if they run out of surgical ones, masks that would not be read as for medical purposes pre-pandemic."
5454,"Most of what my comment was referring to was the change in attitudes, people not acting so suspicious of people that need to wear a face covering."
5455,Doesn't mean the suspicion will go away entirely.

5487,"I'm ""allergic"" to that."

5489,"An article I read mentioned the PEG, so I'm already out of luck."
5490,"&gt; And also simply because they could - they already had the basic design, since it was based on the emergency hospitals they built for the SARS outbreak, and the Chinese also have a number of very large and well equipped nationally owned construction companies."
5491,"It's not just construction capabilities, but China mobilized 30k+ doctors and many more medical personnels, volunteers from across the country to Wuhan  (and the Hubei province) to battle the virus, while the region is in hard lockdown."

5499,Is this proof that their vaccines dont work?
5500,Can you link to a source that says they have started then?
5501,All the numbers i found so far have them at 0.
5502,"Mainly https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations

Unless they JUST started today or something."
5503,Indeed.
5504,"If you wanted to produce a vaccine resistant Covid strain, this is how you'd go about doing it."
5505,Another factor is people can be exposed to a higher viral load in an environment where more people are infected as that viral exposure can add together from multiple people.
5506,I'm still getting contact delivery on my no contact food delivery.. sometimes even when I specify in delivery instructions in addition to the 'no contact' check box.
5507,"If Human history started in October 2020, that would be true."
5508,You‚Äôre also wilfully and maliciously ignoring all the other times he‚Äôs lied to us before moving the goalposts.
5509,"I live in Catalonia, and we've had 17,320 recorded deaths from Covid so far with a population of 7.5 million (the real count is probably higher.)"
5510,"That's 0.23% of the entire population that has died, and the virus is still going strong..."
5511,"And also simply because they could - they already had the basic design, since it was based on the emergency hospitals they built for the SARS outbreak, and the Chinese also have a number of very large and well equipped nationally owned construction companies."
5512,"Sure, if you build a bunch of emergency hospitals and end up not using them then you just wasted a lot of money - but they apparently considered the risk of that acceptable in order to offset the risk represented by NOT building them and then finding they needed them."
5513,They also apparently decided that since most general hospitals are not designed or constructed to handle large numbers of infectious disease patients that it was best to try and centralize the treatment as much as possible into facilities that were.
5514,This should also reduce the risk of nosocomial coronavirus infection in patients that were visiting hospital for other reasons.
5515,These all seem like entirely sensible decisions given the information and resources available to them.
5516,"Me and my husband have each had our first dose (mine Pfizer, his Moderna.)"
5517,"Let me tell you, I am pissed that this is even being considered."

5519,"I signed up to get a newly-tested vaccine, *in the manner it was tested."
5520,"* Not some half-baked way, made up by politicians who are too incompetent to keep people from dying en masse."
5521,"Besides that, the US government has done nothing (that I know of) to increase the logistics of actually giving out the shots."
5522,"Same with restrictions, it's: let everyone make their own rules and do it their own way, for max disorganization."
5523,"I have full confidence that, if those second doses were re-routed to first doses, they wouldn't even make it into people's arms."
5524,It would be a pointless waste of the vaccine doses that have already been given.
5525,Isreal is tops at 10% of the population vaccinated.
5526,They have a much smaller population.

5531,"If NZ had an endemic strain that spread at R0 of 4.5 then it is impressive that they stopped it, the article however shows more then half of weekly cases continuity coming from outside."
5532,To nitpick a bit the paper that found the D614G also showed it's spread.
5533,"All countries started out with the Wuhan variant then that strand was driven to extinction by the new one, this can only happen if the new variant is more infectious or can spread more asymptomatic and thus escape containment and outrace all other variants."
5534,"I call it the Italy variant because there the spread was exclusively D614G from the beginning, it could have originated in Wuhan/France but we know for sure Germany, France and UK started with a different strain then Italy."
5535,Not true
5536,The news about the vaccines possibly not working on the South African strain are throwing me into deep despair.
5537,This better not be true because I can‚Äôt keep doing this for another full year.
5538,The US might be in second place but it is still doing abysmally.
5539,Entry of the South African variant would make the situation worse.

5543,"In Finland we do have a tier system, and it works."
5544,"We got 3 tiers, base level, accelerating and spreading."
5545,"The difference is basically just that the bulletpoints is given by local officials, rather than national."
5546,"Masking is recommended on public transport, travel is discouraged, limit on public gatherings and working from home recommended."
5547,That's pretty much it on base level.
5548,"Next level is basically more masking, smaller gatherings, closing most hobbies from adults, possibly distance learning for older students."
5549,"Last level is pretty much similar ramp up of restrictions, even more masking (if possible), even smaller gatherings, closing of most public places and canceling any hobbies still using them, more children to distance learning."
5550,"Limits to private businesses are national (restaurants, private gyms etc.)"
5551,so they aren't controlled by tiers.
5552,The tiers allow for more local adjustments.
5553,"There is minimum level of restrictions on each tier, but more are usually put in place to target the local problem (crossborder travel, hobbies, events, big schools etc)."
5554,"There are 21 areas 17 of which are experiencing a drop in cases (√Öland and Tornio area rising), some of which seem to be about to drop a tier so it works fine."
5555,It is the whole part.

5569,They apparently don't consider us to be in the same state of emergency.
5570,"Note, India has approved the Oxford vaccine."
5571,The US media downplaying coronavirus in February and pushing the idea influenza was worse and masks don't work helped create the coronahoax antimask environment that exists now.

5590,"That means you can‚Äôt rely on safety data from prior trials with different delivery systems, not to mention concerns with scale."

5606,Maybe they took the trip cause it was one of the only weekends they had where their disability didn't make it impossible.

5613,What are the rules as far as FDA approval?
5614,Its known as the 'Arnold Palmer'
5615,It won't be a black and white thing in terms of the virus escaping the vaccines.

5648,The state I live in has moved to 1b.
5649,"So now, if you're over 65 or if you're over 18 and have certain medical conditions, you can get vaccinated."
5650,We don't have a centralized system.
5651,"So if you're trying to locate a vaccine, you have to call every place that distributes the vaccine to see if they have a one available for you."
5652,"In my county, that's dozens."
5653,And it's not just hospitals.
5654,Doctors offices and pharmacies also have limited amounts of vaccines right now.
5655,"Some are choosing to still only vaccinate 1a, others have moved on to 1b."
5656,It's impossible to know which are which until you contact them.
5657,"Some have waiting lists, some don't."
5658,"Some have online sign up capability, some don't."
5659,Some are only vaccinating their existing patients.
5660,Some will vaccinate anyone.
5661,It's just up to that particular location what they're doing.
5662,"Sometimes, you call a facility and they don't even know what they're doing."
5663,The state has said this will not change.
5664,That they are simply the distributor of the vaccine to the various providers.
5665,So this will remain a clusterf\*ck until there is huge amount of vaccine available so you can just go anywhere to get it.
5666,That's why we need a centralized database.
5667,I personally wouldn't want it at the federal level.
5668,State or even county level is fine.
5669,The county doesn't have the money to create one though.
5670,They've already said so.
5671,"Yeah, more have died, but wayyyy more cheaply at least /s"

5683,"There was a mushy line prior, they just drew a hard line now on what was already pretty much the standard of care."
5684,"Of course if things continue to get worse, this may change."
5685,But it has not reached that point yet and the article is just click bait pandering to emotions and fear of people.
5686,You are correct.
5687,"Partial immunisation of an individual will not encourage the emergence of resistance, only immunising part of a population is an ideal way of generating variants that will evade vaccine induced immunity."
5688,The American government also gives money to films that show the military in a good light and allows them access to military equipment that they wouldn't otherwise have access to so they can have a real Abrams in the shot and things like that.
5689,"I know some 70+ people that have no idea how much time they even have left, and haven't seen their children or grandchildren in a year."

5700,Looking into California‚Äôs data (specifically Los Angeles county given the headlines around the direness of the situation there) and compared to New York City in spring.
5701,"At peak, NYC had 77,000 cases."
5702,"I don‚Äôt know if Los Angeles county has peaked yet, but their highest is 42,000."
5703,"I think the populations of the two counties are around the same, generally speaking (LA‚Äôs 10 million to NYC‚Äôs 8 million)."
5704,"https://covid19-projections.com/infections/counties/ca/los-angeles

https://covid19-projections.com/infections/counties/ny/new-york-city

Just regarding the deaths, NYC peaked at almost 800 deaths per day (9 per 100,000), LA‚Äôs peak so far is almost 200 per day (1.8 per 100,000)."
5705,"How can a ""spike"" that is *one fourth* the previous level of deaths cause a ""total collapse"" of a heath care system that handled the previous events?"
5706,Why is no one suing these publishers for running these stories that don't align with facts?
5707,Why is no one following the data and science?
5708,"Assuming that hospitals aren't overrun, and I don't see why they would be at those levels."
5709,It would be nice if people wore masks if they were actively sick with the flu and still going out.
5710,"Actually, it'd be nice if people just stayed home if sick and contagious."
5711,"But I am more than ready to stop wearing a mask everywhere, even though I currently do."
5712,[deleted]
5713,Way more than 1 third.
5714,78-85 is included in the ‚Äú65l yo number and is probably the majority in the group.
5715,There's no long term safety studies.
5716,There's no studies on people with confirmed pre-existing autoimmunity.
5717,There are some very good reasons to wait for a bit more evidence.
5718,"You know we're not actually suggesting letting people *fight* for vaccines, right?"
5719,We don't everybody to stand in a circle where a bunch of vaccines are dropped in the middle.
5720,We just want to set up vaccination drives that administer vaccines on a first-come-first-serve basis.
5721,I was interested too since I remember the data saying different.
5722,"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/21/world/coronavirus-missing-deaths.html

This article has Sweden 10% above normal deaths and Finland only 3%

You can compare graphs here, which show Finland mostly in ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and Sweden spiking above a substantial increase: https://www.euromomo.eu/graphs-and-maps/#z-scores-by-country"
5723,"their numbers magically dropped a day after Xi gave a big speech talking tough

that and china lie about things that are really not anything you need to lie about, so naturally they are not going to be telling the truth here either"
5724,We are a joke
5725,It's spreading by mutation.
5726,Not contact..
5727,Where do you live?
5728,Everything is shut in Berlin
5729,Complete nationalization of the healthcare industry is the solution.
5730,"Every hospital funded by the Nation, every doctor employed by the Nation for the health of the Nation."
5731,"Wealthy Tampa plastic surgeons who choose to contest the Nation should be sent to reeducation camps and then shot, regardless of whether their reeducation is successful."
5732,"Im already fighting covid in my home....

Not much else i can do now."
5733,"Ok, but the US is currently way ahead of Europe so how do you explain the facts?"
5734,So now even a number such as 9000 is worthy of a separate news item?
5735,They really couldn't wait till 10000?
5736,"What's next, 9250 or even 9110 deaths news items?"
5737,And that‚Äôs a conservative estimate.
5738,Sell them to Canada.
5739,We are close and will gladly distribute / use them.
5740,Snap.
5741,"I had got upto 98kg there a while back, till i had to really limit what i eat, as i cant really excursive."
5742,"Back to 90kg now, but i should be in the mid 80s."
5743,"As I said it will creep back normally, yeah the government cant keep you from going to a friends house but they sure as shit can keep you from going to a bar or restaurant."
5744,The health care experts do not know if the vaccine stops the spread or not.
5745,"However, the only way to spread it if you are vaccinated (or immune) is if you can somehow carry the virus without your body fighting it off and then pass it along."
5746,Like it's stuck in your nose and you spread it.
5747,Just seems very unlikely to me.
5748,exactly.
5749,Should just open this wide and start with the vaccination already to the masses.
5750,Too many exceptions are cropping up and this slow down is horseshit.
5751,Our leaders treat their pets with more care than the people.
5752,I just got the call that my grandfather has died within 18 hours of testing positive for coronavirus.
5753,I didn't know anyone who had got it before this.
5754,He was in his mid 90s and led a good life and was ready to move on.
5755,I don't think it was a shock that something would kill him.
5756,I just wish the world circumstance hadn't meant that he spent his last year locked in a nursing home with no visitors.
5757,"Given that you say you're an adult, you don't have to convince him, just don't get vaccinated."
5758,"Lie to him if you want, I guess, but you might as well just tell him the truth so he knows and can take it into his risk assessment."
5759,It's not like he can force you to get it.
5760,"You should try to educate yourself more on the vaccine, though, and talk to your doctor, probably."
5761,It's a new technology.
5762,"That was the complaint they had any these mRNA vaccines (which, to reiterate, are in phase 2/3 for other viruses before covid)."
5763,"Liability has nothing to do with the science, that's frankly political."
5764,Left unused =/= not yet used.
5765,Very bad headline.
5766,Way higher.
5767,We‚Äôre not stopping anytime soon.
5768,&gt; People are now just looking for a reason to blame the feds.
5769,This is the whole fucking reason a federal government exists.
5770,Is that good?
5771,Thr UK/Ireland are also Islands yet both have been hit fairly hard and both in another lockdown right now especially the UK.
5772,Yes admittedly NZ and Australia being located further away from the rest of the world probably does help abit.
5773,But the UK and Ireland and other countries as well could have still enacted similar policies such as banning all international travel and only allowing citizens in and mandating that everyone travelling in must force isolate in a hotel before they're allowed back into the community which almost ensures everyone flying in is covid free by the time they start mixing with the general public.
5774,Allowing people to just fly in without qurantining is only asking for imports of new covid cases.
5775,Ofcourse things will be out of control.
5776,Like how for example alot of countries placed travel bans on the UK after the new variant yet still allowed travellers from other countries.
5777,Like what good is that when the new variant would have already escaped the UK at that point.
5778,And to use Australia as an example in early August the state of Victoria a population of 6.6 million on it's worst days was seeing around 700 cases a day.
5779,"That's almost equivalent to 7,000 cases in the UK which at the time was seeing less than 2,000 cases back in early August."
5780,And now Victoria is mostly back to normal.
5781,It may have been abit harder for the UK to he covid free but cases certainly could of been alot lower especially if they enacted similar policies to Australia
5782,I would bet my next paycheck that 98% of hospital employees have smart phones.
5783,You can.
5784,Hence why very clever people at the JCVI have recommended the change
5785,Hope it clears up for you in 2021.
5786,I get very fat very fast if I don‚Äôt hike long distances every week.
5787,Still swimming with sharks in the meantime...only now we see the rescue boat...
5788,If you would have told me back then that the people daily working around covid patients would actually refuse the vaccine I would have called you dumb.
5789,But they do and now a ton of doses will go straight to shit and the situation won't get better.
5790,Who uses fax machines in this day and age?
5791,why the fuck are you on the corona virus subbreddit to look for hope you actual idiot.
5792,Get your priorities straight.
5793,"They opened 4 pop-up vaccination centers and gave out 600 doses in 2 hours, and found people by just word of mouth."
5794,Why the hell isn't this happening all over the country?
5795,[extremely banworthy comment intended to egg your rage on]
5796,"There's no safety failures that I'm aware of, are you?"
5797,"Cancer vaccines are failing because efficacy, not safety."
5798,This is not surprising.
5799,Cancer is hard.
5800,The vaccines prior were working through phase 2/3.
5801,This is a complete non issue.
5802,"Healthcare workers are very well protected against the virus, and even the vaccinated workers will have full PPE equipment at all times."
5803,"Grocery workers, teachers, sure that would be a problem if they don‚Äôt get vaccinated, but I will bet my left nut that you will not get covid from the nurse administrating your vaccine"
5804,"Two months ago Cuomo threatened to have the NY health board review the vaccine trials on their own before approval, because he didn‚Äôt trust the ‚ÄúTrump FDA.‚Äù 

Now you‚Äôre saying these same geniuses (who were *this close* to being trusted to review vaccine trials) are suddenly unable to properly administer vaccine protocols without handholding by the feds?"
5805,Do you know how many people work for the NY board of health?
5806,Both at the city and state level.
5807,"There are a ton of qualified people who know what they are doing, they should be able to get this done."
5808,And this is exactly why I‚Äôm skeptical about getting back into the workforce.

5853,"In theory, the EU commission literally exists to handle stuff like this and definitely shouldn't be worse than Trump, of all people."
5854,Yes you'd probably have grounds for a discrimination lawsuit.
5855,But if it were me I would just try to have a direct conversation with the manager and say that you want the vaccine.
5856,If that doesn't work go to his boss and make the same request.
5857,There is no way that a high level hospital manager is going to refuse a dose of the vaccine to one of the health care workers.
5858,It is hard to fault any kind of instinctual human reaction to a human situation like this - we see the reversion to our animal selves and basic emotions like fear anger apathy take the stage.
5859,"However, as civilized human beings we do have to hold ourselves up to a logical and responsible standard."
5860,"That means make up your damn mind - if a country collectively does not want the vaccine they need to buckle down and hide away their sick and elderly and just let the live virus sweep over them as quickly as possible (this would never be my choice, by the way, as I know death is not the worst consequence of contracting this virus), else... grow the cojones to commit to the other direction, and stay well socially distanced until vaccine and then make the decision to vaccinate as soon as your regulatory agencies tell you it is safe, and stop f ing mucking around!"

6016,Fuck these people.

6018,What?
6019,"No, as a Japanese I‚Äôm extremely happy that it‚Äôs likely not going to happen."
6020,Remember how they said Fukushima‚Äôs nuclear plant was under control?
6021,No it was not.
6022,Remember how they said it‚Äôs going to be the ‚Äúcompact Olympics‚Äù?
6023,Well it was already the most expensive Olympics ever well before covid.
6024,Remember how they tried to prioritise Olympics over our lives when covid hit Japan?
6025,They ended up postponing it and spread covid.
6026,Did you know that they are pretty much going to force students and medical workers to work for free as ‚Äúvolunteers‚Äù?
6027,This event is just consuming our taxes for nothing and waiting to die.
6028,It‚Äôs full of shit.
6029,Add in the fact that high risk persons are getting the vaccine first and it becomes even more remarkable.
6030,"&gt;Laying alone

ITYM lying alone."
6031,"France low vaccination has nothing to do with skeptics, but with government."

6125,Still don't understand this sentiment.
6126,Only thing that is new about the vaccine is the delivery method.
6127,We have used mRNA in vaccines before for years.
6128,All the ingredients are common materials used for vaccines.
6129,We have decades upon decades of research on vaccines/coronaviruses.
6130,Many people have had the vaccine for a year already and not a single case of someone having covid like symptoms yet.
6131,I will probably never understand being more fearful of a vaccine that has data upon data(and no precedent) supporting its safety vs a covid that's known to kill/maim people.
6132,"Also if long term effects are an issue I'm way way more scared of  years later scientists finding out a long term effect from covid that's show up in people that were considered ""recovered"" or ""its just the flu nothing happened"" population who had covid."

6145,From Lockdowns and restrictions being useless to absolutely terrible vaccination start and strategy.
6146,That's not really surpriaing when preety much every government made every mistake possible and continuea to do so in that pandemic.
6147,To a great extent the government responds to public opinion.
6148,"Once the public is no longer in favor of more restrictions, they will go away."
6149,"I assume this will come about due to a combination of increasing ""pandemic fatigue"" combined with a reduction in the problems caused by the disease as more people get the vaccine."

6171,My brother-in-law lives in Erie County and he is in group 1B.
6172,I assume there are thousands in group 1B in Erie county as well.
6173,We have not ben contacted regarding when it might be available to us.
6174,County Health officials are political appointees.
6175,So we have filed the necessary paperwork.
6176,Don't know how many law enforcement officers filed the necessary paperwork.
6177,When you fill out yours I hope it gives you a spot in line that isn't subject to the whims of a political appointee.
6178,"""Some form of lockdown"" don't work because you can't half ass a pandemic ü§∑"
6179,that's like saying what's the average age of a drunk driving death.
6180,"Sure, seniors are more likely to have bad outcomes."
6181,"BUT, when you're talking about a disease which is the Number One cause of death in America last year, it means that literally hundreds of thousands of those under 65 will die too."
6182,Covid isn't some rare disease like brain cancer or ALS.
6183,Sorry to have to say it but not everyone is cut out for health care.
6184,There are a lot of support jobs but the part of dealing with patients is a calling and not everyone has the right people skills for it.
6185,Just my 30 year observation.
6186,I find it ridiculous that there‚Äôs so much talk about how to stretch out the second dose (or cancel it entirely) to speed up vaccinations in places that haven‚Äôt even given out half of their doses anyway.
6187,"Fair enough, I didn‚Äôt say there was no chance at all."
6188,That's not suspect at all.
6189,I agree.
6190,I worry that could lead to a draft before some policy makers are willing to reflect at our armed services and actually try and change something to make it better.
6191,That doesn't mean our provincial government isn't totally inept unfortunately.
6192,"Same lol, I have nothing to do until College starts up again on the 20th."
6193,"I don't understand the concept of comparing tragedies, especially when they are totally different."

6203,The headline is hyperbolic.
6204,"*‚ÄúThose of Us Who Don‚Äôt Die Are Going to Quit‚Äù...* is basically saying that they're all going to quit, because all of them will survive."
6205,"If they were treating ebola and didn't have adequate PPE, the main thrust of the article, then their deaths % would be in the double digits..."
6206,This is an article about PPE shortage and percurement mismanagement.
6207,They're making it sound as if they are in battle and taking enemy fire...
6208,They're not... Medics have been doing tik toks in full PPE for the best part of a year...

6212,"There is no PPE shortage in my country, guess what else we don't have, dancing medics..."

6232,Extended Lockdown in germany.
6233,Strong lockdown in France and Spain still not enough or up to expectations.
6234,An absolute terrible vaccine start around the world except of Britain and Israel.
6235,I read today that Frannce only vaccinated slightly over 600 fucking people since approval.
6236,That's so fucking bad that you could even start laughing about it.
6237,To compare germany failed also terribly but has over 200.000.
6238,Health care workers refuse to take vaccines making the doses stay in fridges and not being used.
6239,General extreme low trust in vaccines.
6240,The worst thing is that I can't do anything against this.
6241,How much more months of my life will go to shit because the people supposed to handle this are absolutely terrible at their job and because the people around me are fucking idiots?

6243,I won't fucking wait for them.

6251,"People, particularly on Reddit, like to glorify the EU for their progressive and ""forward-thinking"" stances on many issues, but the reality is that the EU is really just an extremely inefficient and wasteful beurocracy which is a terrible recipe for getting anything done expeditiously."
6252,It doesn't matter if it's a vaccination campaign or some other public service.
6253,Virtually nothing will function efficiently once a governing body has grown that bloated and overarching.
6254,"There is no shortage of complaints regarding beurocracy and inefficiency in the US and rightfully so, but the EU is an entirely different animal."
6255,A significant number of Americans would *lose their minds* if soldiers were going door to door vaccinating people.
6256,It's literally like a conspiracy-theory-meme brought to life.
6257,This is the kind of stuff the fringe people have been screaming about since I was a kid in the 1980s.
6258,Fire.
6259,I can obsess even more lmaooo.
6260,Not really equivilant imo.
6261,BLM is fighting against police related brutality/deaths against minorities not just deaths in minorities overall.
6262,Blue Lives Matter consensus is just to protect/support police and law enforcement.

6264,Incorrect.
6265,Any country can use its own regulator with the rules of the EU.
6266,It's a decision to use the EMA.
6267,Lmao what.
6268,Just because only one has been found doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs already everywhere (which it likely is).
6269,It‚Äôs a lot harder to test for the variant than to test for COVID.
6270,"""I ain't no shitbird!"""
6271,Screamed it in the middle of the airport.
6272,"Lol it was effective,  since I've never used that term again."
6273,The news u are talking about is about the UK variant not the South Africa one.
6274,"They aren't sure if the vaccine will work on it, and also its even more contagious than the UK variant"
6275,The 2009 pH1N1 had a fatality rate of something like 0.02%.
6276,The regular seasonal flu averages at 0.1%.
6277,"The reason people didn't line up around the block for that shot is that it was pretty clear  to most sensible people that there wasn't, in fact, a scary pandemic going on."
6278,"What's more, US hospitals, when testing for the new virus in suspected influenza cases, they found that only single digit percentages were positive for the pandemic strain."
6279,"Interestingly, in the vast majority of cases, no seasonal influenza strain was detected either."
6280,"The bungling of the 2009 ""pandemic"" response by the WHO, the CDC, and other public health authorities is one of the reasons for the widespread skepticism regarding the COVID response."
6281,Thanks!
6282,"It hurts really bad, so I took the day off work."
6283,It feels like someone has their fingers between my muscles and is pulling them apart.
6284,The Russians would never have surrendered even if the Nazis took Moscow.
6285,They knew the Germans were waging a war of extermination against them and surrender would mean extermination.
6286,"The Russians did not even surrender when Napoleon took Moscow, and that was not a war of extermination."
6287,lol.
6288,Why do you need a home?
6289,Can get free drugs and tent with beautiful pacific views for free.
6290,"Some of them do think that and I have asked why make a virus that according to them is 'not deadly to 99% of people'....then wait months....then push a vaccine, when they could have just made a more deadly virus in the first place?"
6291,It would be much cheaper and quicker if you want depopulation.
6292,I got tumbleweed as a response.
6293,Honestly hard to say i know it's quite dominant in the UK and is spreading in Ireland.
6294,So if you're in the Uk for example you've probably got the new variant.
6295,If in the US hard to say.
6296,I guess your chances are lower since it's not as widespread but then again not many countries do alot of sequencing anyway so it could be more widespread in the US than we think.
6297,But it doesn't cause any more severe illness than previous variants so doesn't really make a difference to you personally
6298,The need for a second dose kind of complicates the situation though.
6299,"For people that received their first dose because there were extra doses left over, what happens when it's time for their second dose and there are no left over doses then?"
6300,Do they get prioritized over someone else's first dose?
6301,Or do they need to wait until it's their turn in line to get the booster?
6302,"Fauci has lost tons of credibility with people in general, he needs to stop sugarcoating shit and just flat out say it because then people take a comment he made and use it against him."
6303,Its best to be 100%  no matter how dire the truth is.
6304,Im sure these reddit warriors won't like to hear that they won't be a able to party this year but at least you were honest.

6307,Get shots in arms.
6308,**Now.
6309,**
6310,Yes.
6311,Nobody has disputed that overall figure.
6312,"Learn to read what I actually wrote:

&gt;52 percent efficacy is the overall efficacy for the first three weeks."

6317,Lmao imagine wearing suspenders

6321,"The ‚Äûdanger‚Äú of defriending is that you create a bubble and don‚Äôt know the struggle of the other side, so you become elitist thinking: oh I‚Äôm so smart and there are so many idiots out there."
6322,It‚Äôs hard to find a common balance here for me
6323,Nobody is saying the immune-comprised don't need protecting.
6324,Of course they do but you can't make the world 100% safe for everyone and it's a balance and a complex one.
6325,And I agree there is enough money but the 'divided fairer' option is getting further away not closer unfortunately and the lockdown is accelerating this.
6326,Businesses are closing around me every day.
6327,The high street as shops closing every week it seems and they won't come back.
6328,The business will go to Amazon who will not pay their fair share of tax and funnel profits offshore and we will have the rich getting richer while the local communities built around town centres and small business fall to pieces.
6329,It looks like it.

6333,There are probably more vets from all other wars than those who were part of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars.
6334,Public based on age first.
6335,Right now 55 or 60+ just open the floodgates.
6336,You can easily verify age and that still gets you a pretty high risk group.

6344,"Nobody knows, including him."
6345,He didn‚Äôt promise it.
6346,He said possible.
6347,Sure it‚Äôs possible.

6351,"If you have a job outside of the home and manage the majority of at home responsibilities, that is an endless, tiresome and daunting experience."
6352,Because of the sheer nature that it is nearly too much for one person to manage.
6353,Most people in this position may feel they are barely getting through the day.
6354,Because not every house has equal division of chores.
6355,Not every house has two or more people to share the responsibility.
6356,Tbh a lot of households that think they have equal division of chores &amp; responsibilities really don‚Äôt.
6357,And just because a homemaker may not be familiar in your household culture doesn‚Äôt mean it doesn‚Äôt exist in other homes and it doesn‚Äôt mean that job is not difficult.
6358,virologists still don't know how long it takes from date of infection before someone becomes contagious.
6359,It can be as little as 24 hours to several days.
6360,"Saying that, you're least likely to spread it to others the first day after exposure."
6361,"After that, all bets are off."
6362,"So, say if you go to a maskless party on Friday nite and then take an Uber or subway back home Sat."
6363,morning.

6373,There is an entire thread about this in r/paramedics that spells it all out for you and lambasts the handwringing.

6375,"If the vaccine doesn't prevent asymptomatic spread, how will it prevent that from happening again?"
6376,and it fucked traffic so badly they quickly stopped.
6377,"Just got my vaccine yesterday, only side effect I experienced was a very slight increase in heart rate which had gone away and the soreness in my arm today."
6378,Healthcare workers should be doing their part in taking the vaccine
6379,Wiping things down protects you from other things so that you don't get COVID plus something else.
6380,"It's still useful, just indirectly."
6381,"But yeah, people are disappointingly cavalier about their lives (and those of others) if they have to do anything that might affect their lifestyle."
6382,Gotta get that brunch.
6383,No more lockdown is a different argument than masks.
6384,"Also, you are basically listing small events by several hundred people max.."
6385,"I can direct you to larger annual conventions about far weirder subjects (UFOs, supernatural creatures, magic, etc) that are not used as argument that entire countries are out of their minds or that these several hundred people are representative sample of that country's population or opinions."
6386,Best way to look at it too.
6387,"It's insurance, not prevention."
6388,"So basically if I‚Äôm vaccinated, 6 months down the line the protection from the new mutation would be closer to that of the first?"
6389,Uhh no.
6390,That's the reason I didn't go to the doctor for 10 years.
6391,We need an app.
6392,It could take 15 minutes instead of 2 hours.
6393,That's essentially the issue my coworker is having.
6394,He also doesn't get his normal care at my hospital so no reason to have their app.
6395,"We know that we can give out FAR more than we currently are though as soon as we give it to the general public because we do it every year with the flu shot, and we did it with the swine flu."
6396,"I don‚Äôt know whether they should do the half dose thing, but our inability to vaccinate people shouldn‚Äôt be a reason for or against changing the schedule."
6397,In the end the same number of shots will be given anyway... Like the reason for the bottleneck doesn‚Äôt matter for whether the schedule should be changed
6398,These are the official numbers from the Swedish statistics bureau.
6399,It's directly from the source so to say.

6436,Whose fucking side are you on?
6437,There have been quite a few studies that show that asymptomatic cases are around 5-15 times as common as those that have been reported.
6438,"This was found through for example antibody tests, i.e."
6439,testing a random population for the antibodies and comparing that to the number of cases.
6440,The CDC now reports this as [1 in 7.2 cases](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/burden.html).

6442,blind patriotism.
6443,"None of the people interviewed in that article say anything analogous to ""vaccines likely no longer work."""
6444,They have different levels of concern that it may be an issue.

6446,"RNs, man."
6447,Prime demographic to sell you some MLM shake or essential oils but won't take a vaccine.
6448,"They really need to start going with a split/rationed approach in vaccine allocation: 

50% - Hospitals, EMT, other medical front line (until they're done)

30% - National Guard - set up mass vaccination drive throughs that are open to anyone

20% - Retail pharmacies like Walmart, Costco, CVS, Walgreens

10% - Businesses."
6449,This could be interesting.
6450,I know many businesses that could work together to facilitate and even pay for staff to come administer doses to their workers.
6451,"Imagine going from ""might not work as well"" to ""likely no longer work"" with a straight face."

6472,"Coronavirus infections in the Netherlands have remained high in recent weeks, despite a tough lockdown in which all schools and many stores were closed last month."
6473,I don't agree with letting vaccines sit in storage.
6474,I think they should vaccinate the elderly and health care workers at the same time.
6475,They're the 2 groups of equal and highest priority.
6476,I just meant health care workers should have priority over a 30 yo grocery store clerk

6500,When do you all think is *theoretically* safest to go shopping after a major holiday date?
6501,1.
6502,"Immediately after the holiday (presumably during incubation, before symptoms develop)
2."
6503,"3-7 days after the holiday (after giving some time for symptoms to potentially develop, if people were to have caught it when going to a holiday gathering)
3."
6504,7+ days after the holiday (symptoms should *probably* have developed by now.
6505,"Hopefully people that have symptoms stay home responsibly)

I was discussing with my wife and was thinking that the theoretical safest time would be immediately after a holiday before people who went to multi-family events start to develop symptoms OR after 7-14 days after the holiday to give those people enough time to certainly develop symptoms and hopefully responsibly quarantine themselves."
6506,I was curious what other folks thought.
6507,Are you really that ignorant and callous?
6508,Have you no empathy?
6509,Grow up.
6510,"""Offer them re-education"" What?"
6511,Like in a camp?

6516,"If not approved, it could take up to 2 years but if the vaccine works, you'd likely get it sooner"
6517,&gt; Then don‚Äôt let them administer the vaccine?
6518,* It has to be done in a controlled environment with monitoring of the patient in case of a reaction for around 15-20 minutes.
6519,"This isn't a quick in&amp;out jab

6527,"Honestly, California is a prime state to begin expanding its rollout to vulnerable groups outside of the health care industry given its high elderly population and that NPIs have been a complete failure over the past few months."
6528,"Enough futzing around with ""fair"" distribution, we just need to get shots into arms as being able to vaccinate as many people as we can is our ultimate goal anyways."
6529,"Likely due to a combination of B.1.1.7 and a minority of the population not adhering to social distancing measures, masks, and hygiene."
6530,"Good go7ng, it helps if the country have prepared well."

6550,They all booked a family vacation in February in Florida.

6556,The history of the 1917 Bath Riots and of Indian reservations are particularly illustrative.
6557,It‚Äôs not the prioritization that‚Äôs slowing this down.
6558,"I‚Äôve worked at a drive through COVID testing site that was only for priority people (medical workers, the elderly, the high risk)."
6559,"It was well publicized who the site was for, and the verification process was as simple as us asking them if they qualified and checking of a box on a form."
6560,It didn‚Äôt slow down the process in the slightest because the lines were hours long and we could just walk up to their car any time.
6561,The real bottle neck for testing (and for vaccines now too) was the availability of tests and people who were qualified to do the swabbing.
6562,They are still at risk levels literally orders of magnitude lower than elderly people.
6563,Letting vaccines sit in storage while people are dying is beyond stupid.

6600,It's more so that you are forced into that hospitals system.
6601,There should be a larger registry where you can see which locations around you have available slots for vsccination.
6602,You shouldn't have to sign up for multiple scheduling services through multiple Healthcare systems just to find the soonest available time slot.
6603,Centralizing the scheduling of vaccine administration allows us to ensure all locations are filling all available time slots to speed up administration.

6620,Makes sense to me.
6621,I've gotten to use this test as part of the initial evaluation.
6622,"I've never failed the test (still have my sense of smell) and have never tested positive for covid, so I can't tell you any more than it seems to work."

Summary from the NYPost

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt wear a mask."
6658,I should‚Äôve.
6659,"I didn‚Äôt,‚Äù Stacey says with oxygen tubes in his nose."
6660,"‚ÄúI believed this was just the flu, that it was all going to go away, that it was political."
6661,"I didn‚Äôt think a mask would help.‚Äù

He struggles as he continues, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to end up like me."
6662,I‚Äôm having trouble breathing.
6663,"I may have to be intubated if I get any worse.‚Äù

Stacey‚Äôs eyes well up as he begs skeptics to change their minds and protect themselves ‚Äî and their families."
6664,"‚ÄúIf wearing a mask can reduce your chances of getting this even by 5 percent, just wear a mask,‚Äù he says."
6665,"‚ÄúDo it for your children, your loved ones."
6666,"Do it for yourself.‚Äù

In May, Stacey blasted employees at his local Donut Hole for wearing face masks."
6667,"‚ÄúI have to say I have had it with the masks that the employees are being forced to wear,‚Äù he wrote on Facebook."
6668,‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just another example of the continued over reaction to this situation ‚Ä¶ Please stop so when we come to eat we can enjoy our meal without feeling sorry for the employees.‚Äù
6669,Which makes sense.
6670,"1 dose does provide some protection, not the best protection but some."
6671,"Given the situation which is out of control, we have to ask ourselves."
6672,Is the trade off worth it?
6673,Give 2 people partial protection or 1 person good protection and just leave the other to fend for them selves.
6674,It's more of a moral question at this point.

6676,You have cultivated an image of others in your head and seem to spend a significant amount of time on the Internet raging about them.
6677,I fear what might happen should you encounter someone you disagree with in person.
6678,It‚Äôs really not a healthy way to be.
6679,Wow thanks for the info I had not heard that
6680,Coronavirus is worse than the flu.
6681,And you say you don't want the virus to destroy livelihoods or trample on human rights...but people are dying and that does infringe on either of the aforementioned?
6682,And what use is a positive test if you think it's unethical to ask people medical questions?
6683,Five years?
6684,Ten?
6685,"If hospitals are at risk of discarding doses, we HAVE to come up with a solution."

6689,Thanks for saying this.
6690,I've been trying to point out how this insane lie rendered many people braindead but people just pile on about saving the supply like it's all good and fine.
6691,Americans love their pets.
6692,We actually value our veterinarians.
6693,"If only we ever cared about the troops outside of car commercials tho, we would probably be a better society."
6694,"Health care workers are exposed to a higher ""concentration"" of sick people as an occupational risk compared to the average person."
6695,This can put them in the hospital as patients.
6696,I agree with priority access for health care workers.
6697,[removed]
6698,"Yup, just as you call the MD at the bottom of his or her class ""Dr.""..."
6699,I'm actually happy about it.
6700,"(I'm not anti-vaxx lol)

The numbers are shady."
6701,Like what dose regimen is most effective and what interval between doses?
6702,"AstraZeneca legit looks rushed, unlike Moderna, Pfizer, Sinopharm, and Sputnik V. 

It shows Health Canada is actually doing an independent review."
6703,I will gladly roll up my sleeve for any vaccine Health Canada approves because I know they aren't acting based on social factors but actual medical factors.
6704,Not sure how happy I am about someone from the board of Moderna leading the charge.
6705,"I mean, I'm grateful for their vaccine, but isn't this a pretty glaring conflict of interest?"
6706,"For Healthcare workers, it's not much of a problem."
6707,The issue comes when non Healthcare people start to get vaccinated.
6708,If it's still being run through hospitals you will have to guess which hospital to sign up for or you'll have to sign up for a bunch of them.
6709,This could lead to a bunch of canceled appointments and lead to a logistics nightmare.
6710,It's also a capitalistic ploy by hospitals to steal market share and gain patients through forcing people to use their app or online scheduling tool.
6711,There's a reason hospitals such as mine don't allow free asymptomatic testing for employees but will test the general population for free en masse.
6712,"Yes, It's pretty similar."
6713,People are always going to prefer a tried-and-tested version over one using new technology though.
6714,I'm all for new technology and even I am a bit uneasy about using this newer technology for such a large number of people.
6715,It's one thing to have a new vaccine be approved and be administered to a couple million people over the next year or two.
6716,It's another thing to administer a million doses *a day* over a couple of months period.
6717,"I don't think the idea is to place one set of people above another, but to give perspective and scale for how many deaths Covid has caused."
6718,"If I'm looking at this headline, I'm not thinking of the groups of people and having any special reverence - I'm just thinking ""huh - I am very surprised that veteran casualties from two wars is lower than those who have died from Covid."""
6719,It just gives scale to a number that is hard to wrap my human head around.
6720,But maybe I'm a simpleton.
6721,I have to assume if those were available they would have gotten one.
6722,[deleted]
6723,This is from May.
6724,Fair point.
6725,It's hyperbole to claim that a pandemic that spread during the busiest travel season in the world only happened because Trump dismantled the response team.
6726,We were never going to stop this spread.
6727,It's so unbelievably American to think that a different American president would have had any influence on a global pandemic that originated in a country that the US has no control over.
6728,And ex-forces.
6729,Forgot that one.
6730,"I am in the DC area and we have friends and family that work in the health care centers, and the Covid wards were closed months ago because there were not enough patients."
6731,It is not the same everywhere.
6732,"You only read the headlines about the places where it is bad, but there are no headlines about the places where it is not so bad."
6733,I think you hit the nail on the head with the knowledge failing to overcome the emotion.
6734,"That's not the problem, though."
6735,The problem is the government.
6736,Conspiracy theories are not unwarranted.
6737,"In the 1940s, the Federal government injected unknowing people with plutonium just to see what it would do."
6738,Other radioactive experiments of one sort or another were performed up until the early 70's with a sickening focus on infants and pregnant women.
6739,Poor black communities have been treated as guinea pigs for all sorts of biological and chemical vapor testing to identify spread patterns in the event of an attack right up through the Cold War.
6740,We only know of these events because cases were incorrectly filed and survived shredding which leaves doubt as to if and when these experiments actually ended.
6741,"Now regarding Covid specifically, we have a great example of a trusted government figure lying to us."
6742,Fauci openly admits he changed the on-air vaccination percentage estimate required for herd immunity to manipulate our behavior.
6743,Fauci also openly admits the lack of available masks was one of the determining reasons for not initially recommending them.
6744,Now any reasonable person realizes he has good intentions but that doesn't change the fact that a trusted government official lied to us in an attempt to control us.
6745,A knowledgeable person should have an emotional response to all of these actions.
6746,It is evident that our current government does not trust us enough to give us the whole truth and in the past has had no qualms about using large swaths of the population as unknowing test subjects.
6747,"In essence, the government has done no favors to the logical mind trying to reason out any efforts on their behalf."
6748,"The left brain asks, ""Why would the government be putting anything other than the vaccine into the vaccine?"""
6749,"and the right brain immediately retorts, ""I don't know."
6750,"Why the F\*\*\* would the government inject radioactive iodine into infants?!?!"""
6751,which leads to an F it all stalemate and an obstinate attitude.

6759,It's not ethical to require someone to take a medication that has not been fully approved yet.
6760,And it's not anti-science to be concerned about taking a vaccine that hasn't yet gone through the full process of studying it for safety and efficacy.
6761,There's a reason that process exists.
6762,"To perfectly clear about my position, it is anti-science to refuse a vaccine that has gone through the full approval process and has been used safely for years, and it's perfectly reasonable to tie someone's job to getting such a vaccine."

6769,I looked at NYC data a while back.
6770,I dont remember any correlation between lockdowns and decreasing deaths but possibly.
6771,Field hospitals like in central park are not uncommon during flu season in other places.
6772,This was 2018.
6773,No one locked down.
6774,https://time.com/5107984/hospitals-handling-burden-flu-patients/
6775,I‚Äôm just amazed that half-assed ‚Äúlockdowns‚Äù are not terribly effective.
6776,Note nothing about this half-assed ‚Äúanalysis‚Äù suggests that lockdowns are ineffective when they‚Äôre not imposed without adequate support or targeted control of movement and then lifted far too early.
6777,In fact we have ample evidence that such measures are essential and effective when not being undermined by austerity-poisoned politicians unwilling to use the government for its intended purpose.
6778,From the list it seems that a large fraction of the countries with the lowest deaths per capita are poor countries which there not because of good pandemic management but because of lack of reporting / low elderly population.
6779,"For example, I very much doubt that Burundi, Eritrea, or Mongolia (the 3 lowest) had exemplary responses to covid."
6780,Right but the point of my comment really lies before March.

6806,We are just beginning the biggest biological battle ever commenced.
6807,We are pitting billions of billions of individual viral cells against 10s-100s of millions vaccinated people.
6808,Throwing a vaccine out at a virus peaking globally is creating an evolutionary battle royal not seen on this planet.
6809,It's going to be an absolute massacre of virus.
6810,"It won't stand a chance, our pretrained immune system will kick viral ass."
6811,"However, one mutation in one virus individual will change the ball game."
6812,One modification to the protein chain our antibodies recognise could render an individual virus immune to our immunity.
6813,That one individual will then have a completely untapped resource of vaccinated individuals to infect.
6814,Becoming vaccine resistant will be the holy grail of mutations with a huge fitness advantage.

6837,"i am not an expert or espicially informed here, but i think if anything there is pressure for them not to become deadly, as you can then go out and infect more people."
6838,"the coronavirus is relatively non-deadly (still worse than typical flu though), but so good at infecting people that the relatively small percentage who die end up being numerous."
6839,"the way viruses work is that they coopt cells and use the cells to start producing more virus instead of doing whatever the cell was supposed to do, so they're essentially parasites and can kill the host if they're too successful or just impact the host the wrong way."
6840,immune response (how the body fights the virus) can also kill the host sometimes.
6841,"evolution isn't foolproof though, so it's still possible to end up with non-ideal traits, like in humans are terrible teeth."
6842,"humans with terrible teeth were successful enough at reproducing, raising their children to adulthood, and contributing to the community that we just have tons of people with tooth issues."
6843,"a virus that commonly kills its host is non-ideal for the virus, but the trait may persist if it still manages to spread to enough new hosts before that happen."
6844,"covid 19 being able to spread via totally asymptomatic people who either don't develop issues or develop them after the infection has passed is an example of an espicially successful virus, imo."
6845,"If only we could test for it, find out where, and isolate it so it doesn't RE-infect everyone (it's rumored to have large numbers of reinfections in SA healthcare workers and resists antibody immune response)"
6846,"It's kind of complicated, but there definitely can be."
6847,"If a more virulent, say by reproducing more quickly and as a result causing tissue damage faster, virus spreads more effectively, it will select for virulence."
6848,"If corpses are handled after death in an unsafe manner, that may also allow for some selection towards being deadly."
6849,"Most viruses do worse by becoming more deadly in humans, especially considering how much more seriously we treat such viruses."
6850,"For COVID, I imagine it will become much less deadly over the coming decades, but who knows for sure."

7011,"Interesting, I didn't know they had started human trials on other mRNA vaccines, though they are tiny trials so far P1,P2."
7012,The things I am actually worried about with this vaccine would be failed protein translations (wrong protein being created that is potentially harmful) and gamete DNA transcription (no data on fertility or birth defects so far).

7151,"Even so, 500 vaccinations in France compared to millions in other countries even neighboring countries is very surprising."
7152,I don't want to pick on any French people but things are not always well organized by the government or by large corporations and things like a 4 day work week and months of vacation time per month do decrease productivity.
7153,But even that doesn't explain the complete lack of adoption of the vaccine.

7158,"It‚Äôs been a while since I got my emergency management certification but the EMS only are following directives from the emergency management apparatus of the city, county, and state."

7160,"If the hospital says no critical patients, they can‚Äôt take a critical patient that all the hospitals in the county will reject."

7164,"It‚Äôs not a conspiracy you dopes, just head down to your local hospital and take a look!"
7165,What do you mean by traditional?
7166,Most people probably think of vaccination as injecting a weakened or dead form of the virus into the body so that it can create antibodies.
7167,That is not what the AZ vaccine does.
7168,Most Americans are wealthy enough to purchase an oxygen concentrator on Amazon and have it delivered next day.

7188,In my personal conversations with others I am inquisitive and do my best to hear them out.
7189,But what I've observed is not very encouraging.
7190,"If most of the hesitancy I've seen were based on a pretty educated understanding I'd be more hopeful but unfortunately what I've personally witnessed leans more towards virtually zero understanding of the trials that have happened, the mechanisms behind mRNA vaccines, or even that there may eventually be access to vaccines that work a different way."
7191,"There's just flat out dismissive statements like ""they rushed it""."
7192,Just yesterday the most vocal anti Covid vax post in my feed was from a no longer working health care worker (now a stay at home mom).
7193,Then this same person commented on another friends post who was nervous about dental work (as she most likely needed a root canal and had never had one).
7194,Now a root canal is one of the most routine procedures beyond cleanings and fillings.
7195,This same lady commented that she should instead get the tooth pulled and start the process of getting an implant because root canals have been proven to cause alsthimers.
7196,Also yesterday on the other side I read a pretty moving post from a friend who received her first dose.
7197,She works in a medium sized nursing home that lost 14 people in the last month.
7198,She has been heartbroken as she was a specialist who works closely with these patients.
7199,"You could tell from her post that she was frustrated that others, after seeing what they all just saw, would continue to come in after doing lord knows what out there without doing everything they can to protect their wards."
7200,They all have at least weeks to go before anyone gets their 2nd dose and they are dropping like flies.
7201,As the pandemic rages in our community its been hard to deny that the workers are the ones bringing it into the congregate care settings and prisons.
7202,Its hard to not have more respect for the second person in my feed.
7203,I don‚Äôt get it either.
7204,"The jury is still out on people with certain conditions, as well as pregnant and breastfeeding women, but the science appears to be crystal clear that this is a safe and effective vaccine."
7205,"Whatever it is, we'd better figure it out fast."
7206,These people are dangerous and much more numerous than I thought.
7207,"I feel rewarded, lol."
7208,It was more fun to read that way
7209,They're going to be vaccinating those who have already had it anyway.
7210,You're not beinf screened to see if you've had covid or not before being vaccinated.
7211,Plus we don't know all that much yet on natural immunity from covid like how long it lasts and if its the same for everyone.
7212,"But i guess there is that chance it may give us a slight boost

In terms of the actual number of cases."
7213,I think alot of it will come down to how many cases we missed back in March/April.
7214,Back then testing was simply atrocious in numerous countries that it's quite clear we we're probably missing most the cases.
7215,"Like for example the US back in March/April was getting 20k-30k cases and 2k deaths a day and then in the summer surge the US was getting 60k+ cases a day and just over 1,200 deaths a day."
7216,And similar thing for European countries where some we're getting 5k cases a day back then compared to France at one point getting 50k cases a day
7217,Here in the Midwest cases peaked just before Thanksgiving.
7218,"Most states didn't lockdown, tons of people gathered, and cases went down after Thanksgiving."
7219,The Thanksgiving spike was a load of crap.
7220,The July 4 spike was also crap.
7221,"And so was Memorial Day, the riots, and many other ""spark"" events that turned out to be nothing."
7222,But I'm sure Christmas and New Year's will be different.
7223,Wait you guys are getting paid?
7224,"Just got the Moderna shot, will update in this thread throughout the day with any side effects."
7225,It's the DJT Virus.
7226,That's what I call it.
7227,Or Covid-2.0
7228,As someone in healthcare everyone I work with comes to work sick.
7229,That‚Äôs what happens when I country has shit vacation time laws.
7230,People would rather use their PTO for trips.
7231,Not colds
7232,There is currently no evidence that the vaccines are any less effective with any currently spreading variant.
7233,"2021 will be much darker, likely because there is hope (vaccines) but too many have too much faith in something they know too little about."
7234,"We haven't seen true collapse yet, but we may soon."
7235,Hope I'm wrong.
7236,Even musicians aren't immune to this.
7237,I know a brilliant choir director who doesn't believe the major pentatonic scale exists.
7238,"Well, there are some pretty clear instances where this can go *horribly* wrong (ie."
7239,See my post at the top level).
7240,"Some people's estates are going to be none-to-happy... and, in California (the most litigious state in the western world), people **will** sue over the darndest things."
7241,"What do you call ‚Äúadding 200,000+ new cases a day‚Äù if not ‚Äòlengthening the world‚Äôs fight against the virus‚Äô?"
7242,Right but after WW2 (which is what the headline refers to) it was 24 million so there‚Äôs been substantial growth since then
7243,I guarantee that neurosurgeons have more education.
7244,Then we have Ben carson.
7245,"I agree, we are lucky."
7246,"We also had the entire world working on a vaccine simultaneously, and with plenty of money to do it."
7247,Unprecedented isn't a strong enough word for the worldwide quest for a vaccine.
7248,Also the Uk is pretty used to doing yearly ( free at the point of use) flu jabs to elderly and vulnerable in a few months so it is like doing that twice.
7249,Once all those people are done the risk of death will be so much lower
7250,The only stat that matters: being able to bench press your body weight.
7251,So I guess they count as mentally handicapped?
7252,"Well, the J&amp;J vaccine and many other vaccines only require one dose."
7253,"So it isn't just an inherent aspect of the immune system, it is specific to particular vaccines."
7254,You don't have to be smart to be a Dr or in this case a pharmacist in this country.
7255,You have to be able to memorize.
7256,If you can parrot you can Doctor.
7257,My dad and brother are both doctors and they are the 2 dumbest mother fuckers I know.
7258,Scary.
7259,"They want you dumb and gullible, and poor!"
7260,They love poor candidates because you'll do anything to make that Dr. Money.
7261,"So unless we quarantine South Africa, due to modern transportation, it could be in the UK already, or spreading to numerous other countries and slowly growing."
7262,"""Lockdown till we get people vaccinated"" is a lot easier than ""lockdown till they develop a vaccine someday"""
7263,Tracking?
7264,From what ive seen on reddit they are concerned about bill gates saying he wanted yo use vaccines for depopulation.
7265,"My name calling was in response to your""short bus"" comment."
7266,"Also i didn't blame you, i have no idea what you have personally done to mitigate your risks, i have a feeling you've probably tried quite hard."
7267,"My comment specifically said your countries government, unless you are in one of the few countries that actually really put in a good effort, nz, aus, Taiwan, Vietnam a few others, then the problems you are facing are down to your governments response."
7268,"There have been a few reports that they think the vaccines will work on those variants but I think they need to specifically test it, which they haven't done yet."
7269,This is getting totally overblown.
7270,"If someone hasn‚Äôt been resuscitated after 20 minutes and doesn‚Äôt have a pulse, they‚Äôre basically dead."
7271,"I‚Äôm not an EMT but I‚Äôm pretty sure survival rates at that point are less than 5%, possibly below 1%."
7272,In this kind of situation it‚Äôs definitely  a waste of resources.
7273,Obviously unfortunate but it‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre tossing sick people from the ambulance in a ditch or something
7274,The CofE pays for the upkeep of 8.5K medieval churches and provides 50 million quid annually to external charities.
7275,Christian churches have provided 5 million meals a month during the pandemic and most churches host the local food bank.
7276,"Muslim, Hindu and Sikh charities have been even more active providing free meals and supporting those who fall through the cracks in the welfare system."
7277,Collectively 43K religious charities in the UK raised 16 billion for charity in 2016 and in 2019 more gave to religious charities (19%) than any other single category.
7278,Their limited tax perks (They still pay VAT) seems to bring value for the taxpayer and country.
7279,"The state is essential, but it cant do everything."
7280,"That‚Äôs what a temporary EO is for

‚ÄúI herby give the military medics the temporary authority to treat civilians during this pandemic emergency to help assist the rollout of the vaccine we need‚Äù"
7281,"If you are a medical professional and you put patients at risk, you lose your license to practice."
7282,&gt; pretty frustrating that there may be 40 million doses supplied to the U.S. and 4 million administered so far.
7283,America: we keep finding new ways to fuck up the pandemic!
7284,The term is Triage.
7285,It‚Äôs what medics do in battle.
7286,"When it‚Äôs this bad,you need to focus on the ones you can save, not the ones you can‚Äôt."
7287,"I am looking forward to the new leadership, not just the president but the cabinet and administrative positions which I think are actually much more relevant to something like this."
7288,I very strongly suspect that Biden and his team are forming a comprehensive plan and are going to hit the ground running.
7289,Communication is one of the most important aspects.
7290,The current administration has seemingly taken delight in cutting off all normal modes of communication and now the grumpy soon to be ex-President has gone pretty quiet.
7291,"Simply informing people about the vaccine, telling them to make a plan to get vaccinated, showing confidence and leadership and compassion, will by itself make a big difference."
7292,What we are seeing now is a lot of very concerned people with no leadership being left to make up their own minds.
7293,Leadership makes a difference.
7294,"As a prior EMT, this is some fscked up bullshit... as it was *drilled* in to our heads that ""the single biggest factor in someone's survival chances, is how quickly they are able to receive advanced life support."""
7295,(ie.
7296,"Getting them in to the Emergency Room)

Also, in California (at the time), we were *unable to pronounce death* in an individual, except in *seven* different cases/situations."
7297,"Hint: one of the cases is ""head detached from body"" (and the other six are similarly ""obvious"")."
7298,"Also, once CPR is started, you are supposed to continue through ""handoff"" to the next highest medical authority (ie."
7299,An actual doctor / ER).
7300,"So, yeah... this is seriously fscked up."
7301,For a 30 year old man the CFR is something like .32%
7302,CDC too busy trying to publish stuff without being censored by Trump.
7303,They couldn't even say masks were good at one point.
7304,States can't print money.
7305,States have a very limited supply of money.
7306,At some point that runs out and you have to cut corners.
7307,This isn't about democrats vs republicans.
7308,We needed to shut everything down for a month.
7309,Enforced it with national guard.
7310,Provided food and shelter for everyone.
7311,Gave everyone a 5-6k per month UBI to make up for lost income.
7312,After the local endemics were controlled we needed to implement NZ style measures for travelers and went back to normal.
7313,We instead made the pandemic into thousands of local endemics that's absolutely impossible to control.
7314,"The entire world needs extra staff: 4 years to train an ICU nurse, 10 years to train an ICU doctor."
7315,I hope the SA variant is just overblown like the mink one was
7316,It's a record high for deaths as of the report date.
7317,You can look up Sweden on 1point3acres to see deaths by report date.
7318,"[Global COVID-19 Tracker &amp; Interactive Charts | Real Time Updates &amp; Digestable Information for Everyone | 1Point3Acres](https://coronavirus.1point3acres.com/en) 

Deaths by the date of death can be found on Worldometers."
7319,"[Sweden Coronavirus: 469,748 Cases and 8,985 Deaths - Worldometer (worldometers.info)](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/sweden/) 

There will always be a downward slope for the last 3-4 weeks, due to lag between death and reporting."
7320,December shows a sharp in the last 2 weeks.
7321,More deaths will be added to that period through January 31st.
7322,Someone show this to the conspiracy theorist who think hospitals just want money and somehow get paid for deaths.
7323,"What place that just cares about money, and gets paid per death, would turn away people on deaths doorstep?"
7324,This is not even the first time I've seen or heard of someone with a MEDICAL DEGREE spouting conspiracy shit.
7325,How are people this immensely stupid making it through school?
7326,Why is California having such a large outbreak with such strict rules on gatherings?
7327,Are people really that selfish they say fuck it and gather anyhow?
7328,Can they not see these reports?
7329,Not defending that dudes co-worker but where are you getting 75%?
7330,If we didn't already have a shortage that would probably work.
7331,"I know a pharmacist in Albuquerque who believes vaccines cause autism, and has for many years."
7332,This isn't necessarily a social media problem.
7333,"All I know it's what I've read, folks seem to think the vaccines makes you immune from this but that's not the case."
7334,"Maybe you misunderstood me or I didn't explain correctly, but I agree with your above statement."
7335,"Sorry, you are right."
7336,I was mistaken to an extent.
7337,"My point still being, length of lockdown is the pivotal aspect to virus reduction."
7338,"In reality, R number depends on the reference points for the average."
7339,"R number is comparable to acceleration/deceleration rate, which declines as you reach 0 or max speed."
7340,R number doesn‚Äôt drop to its lowest point immediately upon locking down but drops as in-home transmission declines.
7341,Once active and pre-infection rates drop after x number of days the R number will undeniably decrease as if in a herd immunity environment (unless reinfection were common).
7342,A lockdown is like punching the brake pedal in a car.
7343,The harder it is pressed (stricter the lockdown) the higher the deceleration rate will be.
7344,The uk variant sounds like it is a Ferrari going full speed with its brakes worn to the calipers.
7345,You can push the brakes as hard as you want but it‚Äôs going to take a while to come to a stop.
7346,"Further, the deceleration rate for say the first 100 meters compared to the last 100 meters will be completely different."
7347,"However, the rate for the entire distance is comparable to how the R number works in a lockdown."
7348,Punch those worn out brakes for a second and put your foot on the gas and you will be at full speed in a second.
7349,Push the brakes for a minute and while it might take a second or two that Ferrari will be back at full speed.
7350,Strictness of a lockdown is vital but the length of the lockdown is the most important aspect.
7351,Fire them?
7352,He doesn‚Äôt look older than that to me.
7353,The hair just is unflattering on purpose.
7354,It is odd that some places are trying to stretch their doses further but in other places 50-75% of them are going unused.
7355,Rather than tinkering with the dose quantity or number of shots I think they should just move the vaccines around more efficiently.
7356,The vaccines were all tested with very specific quantities and dose schedules and any variance from that might or might not work but has not been tested.
7357,I think changing that would only be an act of desperation and there should be many other things you can do first.
7358,"Except the article doesn‚Äôt say that, making it sound like they are hiding the fact that the 1/2 of doses being stored for the second shot is part of that ‚Äú2/3rds not being used‚Äù stat"
7359,"Germany:
721.463 Tests made last week

We'll know more as more time goes on, but I doubt we would need a Covid vaccine every year."
7798,"It mutates far more slowly than the flu, and that's even without any sort of herd immunity yet and it spreading like wildfire

Influenza has a segmented genome, meaning its DNA is in multiple different segments."
7799,These can recombine to create new strains.
7800,"Influenza pandemics are usually caused by antigenic shift, whereby an animal is infected with two different strains of influenza that recombine and create a more infectious and/or lethal new strain."

7811,I don't feel like waiting 8 hours behind white collar work from homers to get turned away.
7812,"The problem is that we have distributed 15M vaccines to be given, but only given about 5M."
7813,We have a distribution problem.
7814,The overly complicated levels are likely part of the problem.
7815,I conceptually agree that we should have a prioritized list but that perfect plan is slowing us down.
7816,If we make it simpler (say based on age) can we use up the supply?
7817,Velocity matters in vaccination.
7818,Almost as if lockdowns don't work...

""False Beliefs About COVID-19

How do these distinct mechanisms‚Äîdistorted sensory information or faulty monitoring of ideas‚Äîhave relevance to cognitively normal and healthy people without dementia who develop false beliefs?"
7989,"For someone without strong science literacy, absorbing and interpreting a graph of data about COVID-19 infections may be as difficult as it is for someone with dementia with Lewy bodies to interpret a face."
7990,"Without reliable sensory data, individuals may be forced to look for other sources of information that resonate with their own feelings, including conspiracies that deny the existence of a threat."
7991,"Rather than engaging with information that is difficult to ‚Äúsee‚Äù and that may require changes in behavior, it may be easier to take in data that are simple and reassuring."
7992,"Conspiracy theories may bring security and calm, as with the patient with frontotemporal dementia who is content to believe they are rich."
7993,"This problem is magnified by social media because before the internet, conspiracy theories usually remained siloed and quickly died off due to lack of supporters."
7994,"Now, social media‚Äìfueled echo chambers amplify these theories, reinforcing false beliefs and discouraging people from seeking the truth."
7995,False beliefs about COVID-19 are also more likely to occur in someone who has faulty systems for monitoring and evaluating scientific information.
7996,"When physicians determine the efficacy of medication like hydroxychloroquine, they read research studies, evaluate the adverse effects of the drug, and some may even study the pharmacokinetics before deciding whether prescribing the medicine is worth the risk."
7997,***This process of logic and reasoning is not accessible just to physicians or scientists.
7998,"It is learned in elementary school and high school and is later sharpened by solving problems in work, college, and graduate school."
7999,"If that process of balancing and comparing all sides of an issue is not taught, an individual is more susceptible to believing false information."

8101,I've been corrected on the length of the Australia lockdown.
8102,"Only Melbourne required that lengthy of restrictions (initial lockdown + second lockdown), however, it is simply mathematically incorrect that you could eliminate COVID in 3-4 months with a lockdown."
8103,The US has millions of active cases.
8104,Australia had 7000 at its peak.
8105,7000 took 3 months of hard lockdown.
8106,Millions would take far more than that.
8107,R0 of 0.8 is the best the US ever did.
8108,R0 of 0.5 is significantly better.
8109,"R0 = 0.5 ==&gt; ~9-12 months

R0 = 0.8 ==&gt; ~3 years

With vaccines on the way, there is simply no reason to target elimination of COVID with a lockdown."
8110,Not a single serious scientist is considering this pathway at this point.
8111,You can't just spitball these estimates.
8112,There is a reason Fauci never even suggested elimination beyond March.
8113,You can literally do the math.
8114,The SA mutation is scary because it has not been confirmed if the vaccine is good for that.

8139,"just because we vaccinated the most susceptible people to the coronavirus, it doesn't mean they are just simply going to lift all restrictions."
8140,"Just by going off  their reaction to the coronavirus so far, they're not going to simply lift everything and let everyone else get sick lmao."

8162,Yep.

8171,Don't give a single damn about anyone else and sure thought there was much more here to do (nature?
8172,Ew why would we do that?)
8173,"But we have also seen a large number of local people (or Saratoga/Albany County) attempting to rent space to get together large groups of people, and have constant locals coming to just get away for a staycation with large groups of family- which can still spread the virus."
8174,I don't call that being decent honestly.
8175,But you seem to underestimate the amount of people in South glens falls/Gansevoort/Saratoga.

8185,People need to follow the rules we have had them in place even if they are confusing
8186,Is immunity from natural infection considered in these predictions?
8187,"Another idea, cattlemen use it as a liquid to pour of cattle to prevent Bot Flies etc."

8215,"I mean, kinda?"
8216,"While that's hopefully and likely true, we don't currently have the evidence that it actually stops transmission, just symptoms."
8217,The other part of the reason for vaccinating health workers first *is* literally so they feel good enough to work (even if working from home) and the health system doesn't crash.

8263,"Everything that the government has done so far, and you actually think that?"

8403,There are other countries who haven't jabbed a single person and others like France who's rates are in the hundreds per day.
8404,And here we are 500k per day and we're not even at full speed yet and you're out here bitching.
8405,Is it going as fast as we'd like?
8406,No.
8407,Are we at full production speed yet?
8408,Also no.
8409,"But my lord, this is the biggest immunization project in human history and y'all like ""Yeah but I wanted it done by April and they're projecting till July??"
8410,"Like, cAn'T gO MucH sLoWeR amiright?"""
8411,"So fucking ungrateful, we weren't even *owed* a vaccine at this time at all, it's a goddamn miracle in and of itself."
8412,"I'm not saying we should accept an incompetent rollout, but how the fuck *any* of you can look at the scope, scale and logistics of this massive effort and find half a *million* this early on to not be up to snuff is disgusting."
8413,"We'll hit a million per day easily at full scale, and when we do we'll hit the herd immunity numbers by early Summer and when we do that it would've been the greatest immunization effort in history, and you'll be here, complaining how they couldn't do it faster."
8414,Just.
8415,Gross.

8433,Can't we just let covid do that?
8434,I mean...
8435,It's doing a pretty good job and the new variation is supposedly more contagious and worse for younger population groups.
8436,I mean if that's the theory it's pretty shit.
8437,You are not right.

8444,I get the point of this kind of comment but elitism isn't really the way to go.
8445,"Lots of rich, educated people are plain stupid at the way they're handling the pandemic too."
8446,Going to be unit 70% of population gets the shot.
8447,wonder if that is 0 improvement as you would think 90% of those that would obey them already are.
8448,Formal education and being in some licensed position really means nothing.
8449,"I mean, just look at Lin Wood over the past week."
8450,He‚Äôs a lawyer that‚Äôs passed the bar and is being a nut.
8451,Can someone explain this to me?
8452,Is it working on the the virus strain found in UK?
8453,"And this SA strain also stronger than the vaccine,  why they vaccinate us without upgrading the vaccine?"
8454,Or is it giving any general protection?
8455,Like better than nothing?
8456,I wonder if they will be getting more than 2 million doses in Q1?
8457,"On the flip side, you have politicians that are the flip side, overly optimistic."
8458,Was this an actual pharmacist (vs a pharmacy tech?)
8459,Someone needs to lose their license.
8460,And maybe take an undergraduate biology refresher class.
8461,"Seriously, the airline model is perfect for this."
8462,They want every seat filled on every flight.
8463,Get their finance folks on a board for vaccine distribution and you will see the most efficient use of vaccines by far.
8464,"It's also interesting to think that in the UK only hospitalised people got tested during the first lockdown, so total cases now vs hospitalised cases then is basically what we're looking at on the news."
8465,"Nah NZ fucked up on masks, arguably why we needed such a tough lockdown while Asian countries could get by without lockdowns."
8466,Ya let me jump right on that...
8467,"Oops, I thought I read Kanye West."
8468,True but they do not have an international airport.
8469,They base this on excess deaths.
8470,"But we know that in the US at least, the majority of excess deaths, in the 25-44 age range, are not Covid-19."
8471,And we know what those are.
8472,So just because there is a gap between excess deaths and Covid deaths doesn‚Äôt mean you are undercounting necessarily.
8473,"https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/12/data-reveal-deadliness-covid-19-even-young-adults

This is from CIDRAP, run by Michael Osterholm, Biden‚Äôs Covid advisor."
8474,"Also, the number one cause of excess deaths in all age ranges, according to the CDC‚Äôs excess death Tracking site, is Alzheimer‚Äôs and dementia."
8475,Not surprising if you have ever had someone close to you have one of those and understand what they need.
8476,Disgraceful.

8479,"Yeah, there are certainly a few states that are much more normal, FL and TX being by far the most populous ones."
8480,"But there are also many places where things are very not normal, too."
8481,"CA, IL, NY being big ones, but certainly not the only."
8482,as someone who is indian american and has family in Mumbai....what are you implying here?
8483,Fauci isn't running the vaccination schedules and logistics.
8484,"If they get rolled out faster, great."
8485,"Firefighters, EMTs, Wilderness EMTs, national guard medics."
8486,This isn't a charity run we're trying to find coverage for.
8487,"I feel like we can probably drum up some people who could monitor for anaphylactic reactions, administer an epi, and transport."
8488,"I can see you're here to fight, so I'm going to tap out of this convo now, but I won't agree that this is an impossible task."
8489,It‚Äôs about time this dum-dum came up with a plan.
8490,In at least two counties the only way to sign up for the vaccine is online.
8491,Many older people are not internet savvy enough and/or don‚Äôt have internet access and therefore can‚Äôt sign up.
8492,This should have been planned better many months ago!
8493,Desantis and his government are incompetent.
8494,[removed]
8495,That is interesting to know.good to be aware of.
8496,"Oh yeah, then where are SARS and MERS?"
8497,You‚Äôd be a mega asshole
8498,I think its just frustrating to have yet another timeline they have promised be delayed further.
8499,especially when vaccines are expiring or being tampered with and not even going to the intended recipients.
8500,they've had months to prepare.
8501,i think americans hold themselves to a very high standard due to us being one of hte most developed countries.
8502,I think the mentality is why settle for less when we know we are capable of such more efficiency.
8503,this is exacerbated by thousands dying everyday.
8504,Then ask - I live in IL.
8505,Family in CA is also very much not normal.
8506,"There aren't very many ""very liberal state[s]"" that are 98% back to normal, unless your normal is very much centered around being in your own house all the time, you've kept your job, and all your loved ones are nearby."
8507,That isn't true for most people.
8508,If you can pay the fee you get a degree!
8509,Are you giving the shot?
8510,"Just out of curiosity, how many doses can you give in a regular working day?"
8511,"I *have* read several pieces about the legal and principle disputes, like [this one](https://www.thestandnews.com/politics/Ë≥™ÁñëÊîøÂ∫úÊé®ÈÅ≤ÈÅ∏ËàâÊ≥ïÁêÜÂü∫Á§é-ÊâπË©ïÊèêË´ã‰∫∫Â§ßÂ∏∏ÂßîËôïÁêÜË≠∞Âì°‰ªªÊúü-Â§ßÂæãÂ∏´ÂÖ¨ÊúÉ-ÊîøÂ∫úÂØ¶ÁπûÈÅéÂü∫Êú¨Ê≥ï-Ë°ùÊìäÊ≥ïÊ≤ª/)."

8513,I was just saying that I'm not literally a Basic Law lawyer with the legal competence to judge the fine details and mechanisms.
8514,"&gt;	without consulting the medical advisors

Very interested to see a source for that."
8515,And months of eagerly anticipating these vaccines being available.
8516,"The fact that production is not the limiting factor right is downright embarrassing, for basically every country"
8517,Where?
8518,"&gt; I can tell you as a virologist 

when do you think it'll be back to normal"
8519,You can buy KN95 masks on Amazon.
8520,"Not brand name, but they pass the same certification tests."
8521,"Yeah 65+ is a bit of a cluster, agreed."
8522,80+ or 75+ would be better.
8523,But the simplicity of healthcare/LTC/First responders and then by age seems like the most ideal.
8524,Things could start getting more smooth with the tiers tho.
8525,I hope.
8526,"&gt; We're hitting 500,000 a day now

Doubt it."
8527,Exactly!
8528,Fauci's been saying fall 2021 for a while now.
8529,If I had to guess it‚Äôd be 50% to start and could be really close to full by the end of the season.
8530,It‚Äôs just hard to see that happening in certain states and to make predictions so far out.
8531,"Anywhere in the SEC, pfffft!"
8532,absolutely.
8533,To me that gives long term hope.
8534,It‚Äôs going to seem really silly to people to be walking into 10% capacity with masks when the SEC is packing them in and having a party.
8535,How we are in June/July is the real barometer in my mind.
8536,vaccines available to everyone who wants them by April.
8537,everything open by memorial day.
8538,"
6 million people in NY were vaccinated in 1947 in a few weeks with the [polio vaccine](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/18/nyregion/nyc-smallpox-vaccine.html)."
8539,"I agree that US is very lucky to have rapid mass vaccination underway, but that doesn‚Äôt make our government immune from criticism for a very slow distribution compared to what should be."
8540,She refused to resign as an MP.
8541,She can't be forcibly removed unless convicted.
8542,If she is sentenced to a custodial sentence of 12 months or longer she is automatically disqualified as MP.
8543,If the sentence is fewer than 12 months she is subject to a possible recall petition.
8544,I have a connective tissue disorder.
8545,"When I was getting genetic testing, which is only done at 2 locations in the US, they would not run the tests without  vitamin D testing."
8546,"Researchers wanted to know not only if I have a severe deficiency but even after taking doses of 50,000 and spending 15 minutes a day in sunlight and diet would change the levels."
8547,I tested a 6 to start.
8548,"After  taking 50,000 x 4 , I tested 9, changing my diet and siting in the sun (luckily I live in Vegas like sunshine and heat weather) the highest I ever tested was 11."
8549,No matter what I tried I could not get my levels up.
8550,"The researchers had found many people that have my subset of connective tissue disorder, just can't get vitamin D levels up."
8551,"I have been tested over the past 10 years, again living in the southwest desert, where there is sun almost everyday and most summers there is not one day of rain for 3+ months and my vitamin D is under 10."
8552,"My son who also has the condition, has vitamin D under 10, while my husband levels were at or above 50 every time and we eat about the same foods , spend the same amount of time outside and I take my son and I take extra supplements and my husband does not."
8553,I think some people like me might never get regular levels of vitamin D but it is my genetic condition that is the cause so no mega dose could help.
8554,This is what happens when you only read the headlines.
8555,Fauci has mentioned vaccines being available and restrictions starting to lighten in spring.
8556,But he‚Äôs always been saying at least fall for full normalcy.
8557,"But people want good news, so the only part of the quote that makes it into the headline is ‚ÄúFauci says normal by spring!‚Äù"
8558,"Yogi Berra, right?"
8559,and thats how we get mob justice
8560,"I feel badly for those people, but could this be any more stupid?"
8561,"So they should do a trial at half dose and see what it shows ... but if the data says it's only 75% effective or even less, then what?"
8562,On rule for thee and other for tee
8563,If you like iceland you'd like save-a-lot
8564,Oh yeah definitely!
8565,I also think everyone will work out the kinks and everywhere will get way more efficient with their vaccines.
8566,Hoping we get to the point we‚Äôre we are vaccinated a few million a day soon enough.
8567,Could have gone through the eyes.
8568,Totally overlooked transmission route.
8569,Isn‚Äôt this like the second time this has happened.
8570,Remember that second wave lol.
8571,It‚Äôs like nobody in this country ever learns.
8572,[removed]
8573,"If it was USPS it‚Äôd be stuck in a distribution center annex with tracking only saying ‚Äúin transit, arriving late‚Äù for weeks on end."
8574,Antibodies are only one part of the equation.
8575,Reduced antibodies doesn‚Äôt necessarily equate to lack of immunity: https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/covid-19-antibodies-diminish-over-time-experts-say-there-s-n1245524
8576,Huh.
8577,Some odd logic there.
8578,"My input is that IF a place is otherwise handling Covid well, then schools should stay open with some modifications."
8579,Individual schools can be shut down for brief periods if there are positive cases in that school.
8580,But case loads have to be light enough that contact tracing can be done effectively for this to work.
8581,"It looks like Finland is well within those margins and could have schools open safely; however, there are a lot of countries that haven't been since last February."
8582,Disgraceful
8583,Erm... What qualifies you to be a pharmacist in the US?
8584,"Is it like the rest of the world where you need years of training and to pass exams or, like the US police seems to be, need to demonstrate that you can breath?"
8585,I'll take that bet
8586,[removed]
8587,Literally cannot pay these morons to do the right thing.
8588,you said boomers.
8589,so you are auto disqualified.
8590,reddit isnt one person and no this isnt acceptable .
8591,both are assholes and wrong
8592,And COVID is exploding anyway no matter what they do
8593,Agree.
8594,Just not equally so.
8595,whatever.
8596,can't do it right then gtfo
8597,"The problem we have here is that he the media reporting his statements is conflating ""the vaccines might be less effective on this strain"" (which could mean 90% becomes 70%) with it being completely resistant"
8598,"if you say so as far as im concerned, means nothing if it aint getting done"
8599,*cough*
8600,"I know you didn't indicate your feelings about this, so I'm not implying you feel this way, but it seems like reddit is 100% on board with felons getting second chances until they hear the crime."
8601,"I think reddit substitutes ""felon"" for ""caught with a dime bag"" until it's clarified what they did."
8602,Anything other than a drug offense and the collective hivemind wants blood.
8603,More insults and now you've reduced yourself to spell checking me.
8604,"Let's keep going, I'm gonna get a black out on ""Logical fallacies and coping mechanisms when you're losing an argument"" Bingo card ü§£"
8605,‚ÄúUSA is doing amazing at vaccine distribution‚Äù.

8609,yet they‚Äôre both worthless
8610,"Just curious, what other treatment is there for high profile people that isn't avalible for normal people?"
8611,Nope.
8612,Common sense says that we (residents of Key West) had to do something to discourage the 50K+ NYE crowds that usually stand shoulder to shoulder on Duval Street.
8613,"The residents are thrilled with how smoothly it went and how it did exactly what was intended, reduce crowds during a global health pandemic."
8614,"You realize curfews have nothing to do with the virus telling time, nor do any curfews purport that, right?"
8615,Edit: Check out the key West sub to see how the residents feel about this
8616,Had the recipients of the vaccines already been chosen?
8617,Because yeah 500 counts would certainly look bad on his record...
8618,"440,000 coronavirus vaccines have been distributed to NYC so far."
8619,Less than a quarter of those doses have been administered.
8620,Neighboring Connecticut has administered over half of their doses so far.
8621,https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/
8622,USA.
8623,It's not happening.
8624,At least not until every last hospital worker including administrators have theirs.
8625,The idea of splitting the vaccine dose (in the US) is very stupid especially from a PR standpoint.
8626,"I've personally convinced many people that the vaccines are safe and worth getting, and this helped a few people I know change their minds from ""maybe"" to ""I'll get it ASAP""

Now, they are back on the fence and I can't say I blame them."
8627,"All of the data is based on an approved dosing structure, and suddenly the government wants to split the dose for efficiency?"
8628,"We can't even get the doses we have out on time in Cal, so what's doubling it going to do?"
8629,This rollout is worse than I could have imagined on every level.
8630,"They want to micromanage who gets the vaccine so much so that they'd rather let doses go to waste than accidentally let someone ""skip the line."""
8631,I needed to rant.
8632,This should be a lesson to you that you  should try to get your news from a more reliable source.
8633,I can tell you as a virologist that no one in my field was telling you that things would be back to normal last spring.
8634,It was always going to be at least a year for a vaccine to be created and nearly another to be distributed.
8635,"Our current timeline is actually the best case scenario, because there was no guarantee that those new mRNA vaccines were going to work."
8636,"If you listened to bullshit promising you good news because it was what you wanted to hear, than that‚Äôs on you."
8637,But Fauci (and damn near every other infectious disease expert) has been pretty clear on the timeline all along.
8638,"&gt;	The fact that it is being labelled as the ‚ÄúUK variant‚Äù isn‚Äôt even fair

Tell that to the Spanish flu"
8639,No you don't
8640,"The same reason the Spanish Flu has its name, presumably."
8641,It was just made famous in the respective countries.
8642,Because it was not left to them in a state where it was maintainable.
8643,"And then there‚Äôs the culpability of Belgian nuns in the Ebola crisis (spreading Ebola by re-using needles), as an example."
8644,"So, just as an example from a different country: if you are a coffee buyer, you‚Äôll no doubt see coffee on occasion from Nicaragua."
8645,"And if you‚Äôve been to Nicaragua (which I have, more than once), you may learn know that, while they do grow coffee, it‚Äôs entirely a product produced by others for others, and Nicaraguans do not benefit (except for some labor)."
8646,Why?
8647,Because it‚Äôs been made sure that the Nicaraguans *do not have coffee bean bags or the means to make them* (one attempt having been blown up at one point).
8648,"They do not have coffee roasting equipment (at production scale), and their attempts to import same have been sabotaged."
8649,"Because colonialism still exists, and still keeps poor countries poor."
8650,Psychologists have been saying for a while now we have a timer on cleaning up on this mess because there's going to be be a point the emotional toll of the restrictions is so much people just won't comply anymore
8651,Where I live restaurants are closed for dining.
8652,Stores have a 25% capacity maximum.
8653,Schools are closed.
8654,All events like rec league sports/town festivals/basically anything where people do things are cancelled.
8655,It is extremely not normal.
8656,"""If you do X, Y, and Z, we can return to normal sooner"" -Fauci

""No"" -Morons

""You didn't do X, Y, and Z, now it will take longer to return to normal"" -Fauci

""FAUCI WAS RONG!"""
8657,-Morons
8658,Texas and FL are not doing great long lines and first come first served essentially (like 1/3 of those states are eligible) is not ideal.
8659,Vermont has nailed it (yet again) in my opinion by going mostly age based but starting higher than just 65 to minimize the number of people eligible
8660,Yup.
8661,My friend told me her friend is a doctor from Harvard and is concerned about the vaccine.
8662,"She was all, ""Harvard, says it all."""
8663,No it doesn't.
8664,That just means you're a good test taker.
8665,"too*
yeah the government will pull a 180 and willingly let it spread like wildfire rofl."
8666,"sick logic, crazy guy."
8667,[removed]
8668,To be fair for many it will last time so...
8669,"You do realize that all of those countries have better testing, and include all potential covid deaths (proven or not) whereas the US does not."
8670,"There‚Äôs also the fact that those countries have much denser populations, which increases the spread dramatically."
8671,You can‚Äôt compare a city like Brussels to literally anywhere in South Dakota.
8672,I hate this argument.
8673,It makes zero sense.
8674,"If they really needed and wanted to lower the population, they‚Äôd have to murder off millions upon millions to be successful."
8675,"They‚Äôd plan something way more efficient, I‚Äôm sure."
8676,My ex friend will fly to the UK tomorrow and they didn‚Äôt quarantine before leaving like it‚Äôs advised so lol I am not surprised at all
8677,I didn‚Äôt discredit him at all.
8678,I believe he knows what he‚Äôs talking about.
8679,However...he had several months from probably February - November that he was simply awful at handling public messaging.
8680,It‚Äôs not his fault per se.
8681,It should never have been his job.
8682,This is like when people point out that Tom Brady isn‚Äôt a good running quarterback.
8683,It doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs being discredited.
8684,It just means he sucks at one thing while being great at others.
8685,That‚Äôs what I felt about Fauci up until late November.
8686,I say that about every state health secretary.
8687,It‚Äôs part of why we elect governors and a president: to translate things for the public.
8688,"So yes, it would be ridiculous if that‚Äôs what I had done."
8689,"Well, yeah, that was part of my comment."
8690,"You don't need *every* vaccine giver to be trained to respond to the poor reaction, just someone to help spot it and then an on-site person to respond."
8691,You could easily have one team of paramedics monitoring 20 people giving shots to 100s of people.
8692,"London Ontario here, fun to see that we have the exact same idiots over our way too."
8693,"I think it's 3 years, but either way, it's an advanced degree, and one where a medical professional should know better."
8694,"I got into a ""discussion"" with a fellow faculty member about the covid vaccine, who immediately stated that she would never give it to her kids, and that the herd immunity approach, i.e, letting people die, was the best approach."
8695,She's a P.h.D.
8696,in biochemistry.
8697,Let that sink in.
8698,A fellow faculty member.
8699,We teach graduate students how to conduct research.
8700,"Some social sciences,  but also some nutritional grad students."
8701,"My own brother,  double Master's degrees, one in statistics,  thinks that masks and lockdown are pointless, and that this is a political narrative they're pushing on us."
8702,I don't know what to say anymore.
8703,We're in trouble.
8704,We are?
8705,What country are you from where that isn't happening?
8706,"Great proof that you had 0.0% chance of stopping a virus like this, even when you are fully aware of the pandemic a variant spreads across the entire world in no time flat."
8707,[removed]
8708,Plenty of people work in a hospital.

8710,&gt; What concerns me is that **the mutation apparently arose in a patient with a suppressed immune system.

8712,That could mean that there will always be biotopes within which the virus can improve itself.
8713,** We have to consider this problem in the medium term.
8714,"We still don't know that current vaccines will be effective against the new variants, and even if they are, they may have reduced efficacy or new mutations may occur in the coming weeks and months."
8715,"With the current wide spread of the virus, it is probably no longer true that it doesn't mutate much, as was claimed in the beginning."

8721,"And then he said he was changing the estimates of the percentage we needed vaccinated for herd immunity as the polls revealed that we'd be more accepting of the truth, also not cool."

8791,You want a guarantee that the infection numbers will start to go way down this spring?
8792,Let‚Äôs use math to prove that!
8793,"According to https://covid19-projections.com/infections/us, about 600k people are getting infected per day, 3 times the number of confirmed cases."
8794,Plus we‚Äôll likely begin administering the vaccine to 1 million people per day at some point this month.
8795,"That‚Äôs 1.6 million people per day getting some kind of immunity, aside from the infected people who die."
8796,"So each month, 48 million people become immune to the virus."
8797,"Also, from that website‚Äôs projections, 70 million people have already been infected."
8798,"Let‚Äôs assume they‚Äôre all still immune for simplicity‚Äôs sake, given how rare reinfection is."
8799,So now we can do some math.
8800,"70 + 48 is 118, which adds both the total infections so far and the acquired immunity from January."
8801,"118 + 48 is 166 million, which is the total at the end of February if the current infection totals stay steady."
8802,"Assuming it takes a month from either initially getting infected or getting the first vaccine dose, by the end of March we‚Äôll have half of the population immune."
8803,"At 50% immunity you can‚Äôt expect the spread to be anything like it is now, especially as the weather gets warmer."
8804,And it‚Äôll just keep going down more and more as people get vaccinated.
8805,This makes me confident that spring will be a slow return to normalcy and that we‚Äôll fully get there in summer.
8806,You need to tape newspaper all over the doors and windows to prevent cops peeping in.
8807,"Cool, so they‚Äôre going to jail to contemplate their life choices then?"

8815,I was chided beforehand for keeping my savings in a savings account and not investing it in mutual funds.
8816,"So I bought a bunch of mutual funds, and since I didn't know what the hell I was doing I didn't diversify and it was mostly in tech stocks, which all tanked."
8817,Tens of thousands I'd saved was gone.
8818,Fast forward to 2006.
8819,"I'd recovered somewhat, and had enough money for a down payment on a house."
8820,I was told that real estate was always a great investment and I should buy a house so I wasn't pouring money into rent with no equity.
8821,So I bought a house -- which in the first 18 months lost 40% of its value.

8921,"‚ÄúIf we do that, if we do it efficiently enough over the second quarter of 2021, by the time we get to the end of the summer, i.e., the third quarter, we may actually have enough herd immunity protecting our society that as we get to the end of 2021, we can approach very much some degree of normality that is close to where we were before.‚Äù

January 4th: ""If we get 70 to 85 percent of the population vaccinated and we start right now, we're getting the people who are in the priority groups,"" Fauci said."
8922,"""By the time we get to the end of March, the beginning of April, I would have hoped that we would have taken care of all of those priority [groups] and have what I call 'open season' on vaccines‚Äînamely, anybody who wants a vaccine can get a vaccine."
8923,"If from April, May, June, July and August, we do the kind of vaccine implementation that I'm talking about‚Äîat least a million people a day and maybe more‚Äîby the time we end the summer and get to the fall, we will have achieved that level of herd immunity that I think will get us back to some form of normality, and maybe quite normal."""

9125,you are coming up with baseless theories of when restrictions will fully be lifted.
9126,you think restrictions will fully be lifted after old people get vaccinated lol.

9128,not even once.

9131,"If they went by your logic, restrictions would've only been made to the elderly and people with comorbidities."
9132,Why haven't they done that?
9133,"But all of a sudden, they will pull a 180 and allow young people to go without any restrictions, while the virus is still spreading?"

9143,lmao you keep saying the same shit with no information.
9144,I'm literally saying things based off what the government-federal and state- has done so far.
9145,to say they will pull a 180 is ludicrous.

9150,All we have is educated speculation.
9151,"For the government to blatantly flip on their public stance on using the data strictly for pandemic contact tracing, is such a slap in the face for quite a number of supporters who believed the government would stay in their lane

9304,Eliminate all phases beyond health care employees and long term care facilities and go 100% aged based.
9305,"Open appointments for 80+ now and lower the age required to get an appointment as they become available

Suspend distribution to hospital systems that haven't used more than 75% of thier existing doses other than required 2nd doses."
9306,They can get more when they use thier existing supply.
9307,Distribute widely to retail pharmacies like CVS / Walgreens / Grocery stores.
9308,Would target getting it to as many different places as possible even if they only get a small shipment each.
9309,ups / fedex have done great so far no reason to think that won't continue.
9310,Tell the pharmacies to over schedule in case there are extra doses in a vial.
9311,Leave appointments open the following day for people who don't get it due to over scheduling.
9312,When you finish for the day open the extra appointments for the following day up and someone will take them.
9313,Tell the pharmacies no matter what we waste no doses.
9314,If it's gonna go bad find someone and give it to them higher risk people are preferred but no waste is the number 1 priority.
9315,Pharmacies that are using thier allotted doses quickly would be prioritized for future shipments or for quantity increases
9316,"Yes, I fear you're right, although a part of me holds hope that we'll turn all this around."

9474,Viruses cause an immune response from the body which can lead to complications of the immune system.

1/8 hospitalized patients contract heart conditions from the flu X 1.5 times more likely to contract a heart condition from covid X *the likelihood that an adult would be hospitalized by the flu*."

9526,Agreed.

9653,People are just saying they don‚Äôt want the vaccine *yet.
9654,"* Yes, there‚Äôs people who are flat out refusing but many people just want to wait."
9655,"That doesn‚Äôt make them antivaxxers, belittling them isn‚Äôt going to win them over."
9656,How are you going to verify *that* and prevent cheaters?
9657,There's no standardized registry or ID.
9658,This will turn into a major clusterfuck.
9659,Do vaccines by age.
9660,Age = risk.
9661,How they did it: Not have Cuomo in charge.
9662,[deleted]
9663,"It's like when you go in for minor out patient surgery, and you're in the waiting room with maybe 4 other people... but then you wake up afterwards and there's 30 people in your recovery room that you've never seen before.There's always that guy that doesn't handle anesthesia well either, screaming in the corner about vampires."
9664,I don't know why they expect to find super contagious individuals laying out where anyone can stumble upon them.
9665,We have a family friend who works in a covid ward and shits bananas right now according to her.
9666,"She was also a firm denier for a while, it's sad that she's seen so much carnage in the last 3 months to change her mind... but I guess that's better than having an RN telling all their friends that the disease is nonsense."
9667,"What you're talking about isn't ""goal post moving"" it's trying to give people the best predictions possible during an unprecedented event with the information available."
9668,"Vaccines came out faster than expected, but now distribution is taking longer than expected."
9669,"People want predictions and you can do your best with the info at hand, but reality is going to change things."
9670,Literally no person alive today has ever had to pull off this kind of operation in reality.
9671,Yeah many will be sad that never socializing or seeing the sun will go from being 'heroic' to 'weird'.
9672,"Not in combination with food that is enriched with vitamin D. Simply, what I am saying is don't start chewing away on large quantities of vitamins without the advice of professionals cause it is for sure NOT without risk."
9673,I would fear they would (and I'm assuming they have cases) simply try to sell it on the black market.
9674,This is of course after inoculating any generals and leaders currently in favor.
9675,If anyone gets the vaccine it would be only the military and not the general populace.
9676,They like handouts.
9677,Also make threats to extort aid.
9678,As they have no cases I am unsure they are actually requiring it.
9679,"When the poor nursing staff have to hold up iPads so the family can say goodbye to their loved one, that is an added burden and stress they take on that they never had to before."
9680,"So yeah, that‚Äôs why I spend the time making my argument."
9681,The desire to have a conga line ignore this reality.
9682,Exactly.
9683,This is why I'm not so concerned at all.
9684,Did you read American news lately?
9685,They won‚Äôt even give Americans much needed financial relief and cut it by more than half for a paltry one time payment.
9686,I‚Äôm supposed to trust this government to have my best interests at heart and allow them more control over my daily life?
9687,No.
9688,"Perhaps if we had a government that truly works for its people, but we don‚Äôt and that‚Äôs a harsh reality."
9689,I honestly wonder if it would be better if only health care workers and the most vulnerable get the full 2 doses and everyone else just gets a single dose.
9690,It would significantly increase the number of people we could get vaccinated in the same amount of time and make the logistics easier.
9691,"Maybe it's not possible at all, but it's something I've been thinking about but have no idea about."
9692,Nobody is escaping Zoom hell...
9693,"Trials are a very small amount of people, showing zero long term side affects."
9694,Give it six months where millions of people are getting it and you‚Äôll see more side affects (if any) that may not have been seen during the trials.
9695,"Also, the vaccine was manufactured very quickly, which is a valid reason to worry."
9696,It‚Äôs a lipid soluble vitamin so it does accumulate overtime but I think the toxicity profile is very low but there is the chance for overdose as you said which causes dysregulation in calcium and vitamin K and causes issues with your arteries I believe.
9697,"I‚Äôm driving at the moment but I can try and find some papers later about it ‚Äî doctors will prescribe once weekly doses of 50,000 IU to patients so I think you may be overestimating the dangers a little bit."
9698,As always it‚Äôs best to get with a doctor and do a blood panel ideally but unless you are someone with a genetic disorder I don‚Äôt see the harm in a reasonable usage of a vitamin d supplement
9699,20% of the population isnt enough to be lifted.
9700,"lol you said once you vaccine 20% of the population, then things will automatically become normal."
9701,its not that simple.
9702,what you're saying now and what you said before is completely different.
9703,"&gt;This title needs to be changed

Sub rules forbid changing titles."
9704,That said you are correct that this is under the mandates easing [https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america?view=total-deaths&amp;tab=trend](https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america?view=total-deaths&amp;tab=trend).
9705,One could argue that the title is misleading/clickbait.
9706,"One could also argue that given the extensive holiday travel, the decreased adherence to mandates, ""Covid Fatigue"", and the new emergence of more transmissible variants make the ""mandates easing"" model the most likely scenario."
9707,Time will tell.
9708,Do disasters normally have far fewer deaths than successes?
9709,Japan does not need to rush to distribute a vaccine since they are not currently experiencing 3000+ deaths (or the population adjusted equivalent) a day.
9710,Well and this case does not have travel history
9711,[removed]
9712,We've now seen multiple governors resort to publicly trashing hospitals.
9713,That's how piss-poor the effort of our hospitals has been.
9714,**Take the vaccines out of hospitals and set up drive-in shots with the National Guard for everyone over 60.
9715,"** When demand is satisfied, lower the age to 50."
9716,Keep going until everybody is vaccinated.
9717,"Our hospitals have no incentive to operate quickly on this front, and they're failing to do so."
9718,You don't have to stick to corona analogies either.
9719,The process has been exactly the same for essentially every medical or non-medical product launches in history.
9720,Playstation 5?
9721,Yeah it takes a little while to ramp up.
9722,"Shit takes a while to ramp up, no matter what you do or how hard you want it to be instant."
9723,It says at the end of the article that we will not know for months if this is actually the case.
9724,We ran vaccines thru a speed trial and are now cutting back on the given dosage to speed it up even more.
9725,This is not fact yet so don't talk down to me I'd thank you.
9726,I don't think you're in a position to guarantee anything.
9727,It's way worse in the UK than the US right now!
9728,"I think the math is based on getting to a million a day AND counting on not needing everybody vaccinated for numbers to drop, aka actual herd immunity."
9729,All shops and bars in London were open.
9730,It makes no difference if you have 6 people only in a house buy thousands on Oxford Street and Soho packed evey weekend.
9731,I do agree that there has been many breaking the rules which has obviously made it may worse.
9732,So has the fact that the rules aren't actually enforced.
9733,Where I live mask compliance has been fairly good.
9734,This virus is going to be here for years by the looks of it
9735,"As someone who lived in WI, can confirm, the dumbest people I've found north of texas"
9736,can we get a source on that?
9737,That's a really interesting fact you're insisting on there
9738,And what about Pfizer?
9739,He seems to be one of the few sane people left trying to actually make a difference.
9740,"If not him, who else?"
9741,Trump?
9742,Biden?
9743,Good luck.
9744,"I feel like the easiest solution to this would be to mail everyone in the current phase information, including a phone number for assistance."
9745,Then maybe have 5-10 people on staff to make appts for those that call in.
9746,75% of the deaths come from the cohort that will be vaccinated in 3-4 weeks.
9747,It‚Äôs fine.
9748,I was more speaking to the censorship and intimidation of Drs who were warning about the virus.
9749,Moscow isn't Asia and it never was.
9750,Everyone knows that the vast majority of Russians live in Europe and its leadership is in Europe.
9751,"You're the only person I know who says Russia is an Asian country, Putin is an Asian man, and Isaac Asimov was Asian-American."
9752,"Obesity rates are controllable, but there's poor leadership and no effort on the part of Europeans and North Americans."
9753,"Our first case in Korea happened on the exact same day as the USA's first case, but they have over 1,000 deaths per million, drastically worse than Korea."
9754,Also much worse than China or any other Asian country and almost as bad as some of the worst European countries except for maybe Belgium which is a failure of especially epic proportions.
9755,I see poor hygiene in videos of Europeans and North Americans.
9756,"I see them going without masks in public which is a very unhygienic thing to do, even leaders like Merkel and Trump."
9757,"I've seen videos of Americans spitting on police which is a very unhygienic thing to do at any time, during a pandemic or otherwise."
9758,So what happens if the queen murders someone
9759,I think it's REPUBLICANS who circulate weird theories about education
9760,I answered to the statement that most people have too low levels and that you can take the supplements anyway and it does not cause any harm.
9761,Maybe this is Europe specific but a lot of food in Europe is enriched with vitamin D. So stuffing away with supplements can cause harm.
9762,It is typically not healthy to over consume vitamins.
9763,"I'd argue that a comparison between animals, plants and humans is fairly meaningless, state governments have never been responsible for human quarantine."
9764,"You are allowed to spin the facts however you like, and it will still technically be the truth."
9765,Under control is what they do.
9766,The way I spin the facts is that for better or worse controlling people like this is really effective at getting a desired effect without foreign intervention.
9767,When they all either work at the same place as my spouse or are not currently employed and staying home like I am?
9768,I‚Äôm going to say that the risk is the same as him going into work every day and my own daily stay at home activities.
9769,"As for that, I‚Äôm aware and it‚Äôs why the discussion was brought up but at the same time there are extraordinary circumstances surrounding Christmas in my family and our traditions for every holiday have been shattered since the family death."
9770,The small risk of meeting didn‚Äôt outweigh the desire to gather when it was discussed.
9771,"No one is sick, no one has gotten sick because we‚Äôre all doing our part in this pandemic to protect ourselves and others."
9772,We cancelled our usual ugly sweater party as a family as an example because it was frivolous.
9773,"Christmas is not, not when it could be someone‚Äôs last and that‚Äôs a weight we all feel every single holiday."
9774,Also the county statistics for my county is laughable because they‚Äôre so low.
9775,"We‚Äôve had about 4,000 people test positive since March out of 300k~."
9776,Right now we have 400 cases total for our county.
9777,The risk is incredibly low here because we‚Äôre all being vigilant as a community.
9778,"Is this the ‚Äúif you want to cut in line, wait for the next no-show‚Äù type of thing ?"
9779,"It was not meant to be patronizing, I am trying to point out that the impact of the pandemic is increasingly being placed on the rank and file health care workers."
9780,"This has nothing to do with capabilities, it‚Äôs about pushing more and more of the stress on to folks that did not have this duty because too many people have ignored the guidelines and decided to have a literal conga line."
9781,It would be like telling you ignore certain fires.
9782,"Yeah you can, and do, but eventually it can wear on a person to continually have to face the fact that this family‚Äôs house will be left to burn to the ground."
9783,And the reason for this is 40% of the parents in the city let their kids play with matches.
9784,Los Angeles hospitals are now filling up to the degree that they're not picking up people cardiac arrest if paramedics can't restart the person's heart on-location.
9785,That's not particularly normal.
9786,http://file.lacounty.gov/SDSInter/dhs/1100458_Directive_6revTransportofTraumaticandNontraumaticCardiacArrest.pdf
9787,&gt; Basically the Kim family has kept most of the population there so ignorant about the outside world through information control and so amped up on propaganda for the last 75 years that they live in a different reality.
9788,"Sounds like American politics honestly, especially as it relates to one side of the aisle downplaying the severity of this virus."
9789,"That being said, how would this virus even get into the country."
9790,Isn‚Äôt it extremely hard to get and get out?

9801,Seems she got it at home from her grandchildren - how many people are infected since schools and workplaces are open.
9802,My two aunts were infected this way.
9803,My brother was infected at a restaurant despite having to use masks in public.
9804,This sort of victim blaming / just world nonsense is silly.
9805,"When so many people are infected, these scenarios become inevitable."
9806,The minority of anti-maskers are insignificant compared to keeping schools and workplaces open.
9807,Because you don't personally know anyone who's died therefore the deaths of hundreds of thousands and preventing the deaths of hundreds of thousands more just doesn't matter?
9808,At first only half of our employees said they would take it so it seems another 16% finally caved in.

9820,Lots of people keep saying we had limited restrictions it just isn‚Äôt true.
9821,Groups of no more than 6 people to meet and only outside is hardly limited.
9822,I haven‚Äôt been able to meet up with most of my family properly since before last summer this rule of 6 has been in place the whole time.
9823,If people had all followed the rules the uk would not be in this much of a mess.
9824,A lot of that time it was also no house holds mixing.
9825,"People just keep ignoring the rules going out with people they don‚Äôt live with or in big groups, not wearing masks going to each other‚Äôs houses ect the rules have been in place just a lot of people are too selfish to even try to understand or follow them."
9826,The vaccine optimists are flipping.
9827,Any idea how they're doing so far?
9828,I haven't seen anything on the news.
9829,Are they at least getting the oldies and care home staff vaccinated?
9830,"The initial deaths from March to May were higher for 2 main reasons; it was a novel virus that doctors were unsure how best to treat; we now have research shared from throughout the globe on best practices for survival, and secondly we attributed more deaths in those first few months to covid - from May we changed the goalposts to reporting covid as main cause of death only if it happened within 28 days of positive test."
9831,"Other factors include better resource allocation in hospitals, unified policies and procedures in care homes etc, greater adherence to mask wearing in public spaces (something which wasn't introduced here in the UK until September) and so on."
9832,Finland has a total of 561 dead from covid.
9833,Three times as many died of alcohol related diseases in 2019.
9834,That number is also lower than the number of suicides Finland had in 2019.
9835,Closing schools in Finland would probably do more harm than good.
9836,They should stop selling alcohol before they close the schools.

9842,Even worse her husband's sister is a doctor working with COVID patients and she's out doing the same!
9843,Even worse her immediate family all got COVID a few weeks ago and yet still hung out with her 80 year old father.
9844,Now the whole extended family is infected after getting together for Christmas and one is dead!
9845,It just blows my mind how stupid some people can be.
9846,Even after all this they're using the same ridiculous excuse that the dead uncle died of a heart attack and him having COVID is just a coincidence.
9847,The 15 days was always bull shit but we did flatten the curve then rushed the reopening and refused to go backwards so here we are.
9848,And how is it getting into homes?
9849,Teleportation?
9850,It is like every other viral illness.
9851,One family member catches it outside and proceeds to infect the household.
9852,This is the part of a pandemic that no one really is talking about.
9853,You may not die of COVID but you sure can by not having access to medical care for other reasons

9861,We know that can be frustrating.
9862,True if you look at the data I know coumo puts it up everyday on Twitter is that during the summer months the curve was flat but picked up during November.
9863,The summer plus the vaccine will make things back to normal so my projection is June 2021 is when things will be back to normal.
9864,Maybe if death rates are low in April may we could start seeing some sense of normal

9926,"They also won‚Äôt give economic relief to the organizations, venues, and people that put large events on."
9927,They just want to flaunt themselves as the hero‚Äôs that did ‚Äúa thing‚Äù and have been drunk on power.
9928,They‚Äôre on TV every day.
9929,Why would they give that up?
9930,"We had zero cases in NSW yesterday, so not too bad by any measure."
9931,"My 3 older brothers have tested positive and I‚Äôm in the house with 2/3 of them, I tested negative but idk."
9932,Pls what things can I do to help get the covid out?
9933,If I believe something does it make it factually true ?
9934,It‚Äôs not about deaths as much as it is about how sick people get.
9935,"The death rate overall is low, and we‚Äôve learned enough since the beginning to keep many more people alive who would‚Äôve died 6 months ago."
9936,The issue with returning to normalcy isn‚Äôt dead covid patients - because they don‚Äôt take up hospital beds.
9937,It‚Äôs the sick patients that need the bed and level of care to survive.
9938,There are far too many of them.
9939,The critical care system has a finite capacity.
9940,Under normal circumstances there are enough staffed critical care beds to handle the normal influx (and occasional spikes) of patients who need that level of care.
9941,COVID has changed that.
9942,"So until hospitalizations decrease, not the mortality rate, nothing can return to normal."
9943,A ridiculously low mortality rate means nothing if the hospitalization rate is higher than the capacity to handle the patients.
9944,"COVID can reach a point where but a fraction of a percent of people die, but still have a profound effect on the level and quality of care that non-COVID patients can receive when a health emergency strike them."
9945,Oh stop with this nonsense.
9946,You know what's more important than one semester of online learning instead of in person?
9947,Not having their teachers die so they can make up for it next year.
9948,Like 1920‚Äôs prohibition all over again
9949,[removed]
9950,I could give you a few more reasons.
9951,I think he got the felony hat trick.
9952,"The state and tax payers paid for those doses too, it's not just some internal employee/employer spat where the corporation just lost money, but might also want to keep it on the DL as to not get bad PR."
9953,In this case they HAVE to report the losses to the public and the state has every reason to take it personal.
9954,"I mean, there's lots of stuff closed in lots of places."
9955,"Maybe not where you live, but probably the majority of the US and European population at this point are living under significant restrictions."
9956,"Also not very normal for, you know, the millions of unemployed, the kids not in school, the millions more afraid for their jobs, or anyone who has loved ones stuck on the other side of a border they can't cross."
9957,Unsurprising when half the country still think it‚Äôs fake.
9958,But the US of everyone can afford to keep people at home.
9959,American pig handedness about government control is the reason why thousands more will die in a perceived loss of freedom.
9960,"That‚Äôs not exponential, that‚Äôs geometric."
9961,"That is, a 10% annual growth rate is geometric, while doubling every year is exponential."
9962,"Your comment has been removed because

9969,Similar in UK.
9970,I was sick early February with trouble breathing.
9971,We had heard of the virus in China and a hotspot in Italy.
9972,About a week after I went to the doctor was when they started asking people with breathing difficulties if they'd been to affected areas overseas.
9973,No questions asked at my doctor visit.
9974,Curious to this day if I had covid.
9975,Necrotizing thrombosis&gt;?
9976,"Can confirm, finished undergrad and postgrad education and I‚Äôm still stupid."
9977,"Not a single vaccine creator (Moderna, Pfizer, etc.)"
9978,have come out and given a green-light to (mis)use their vaccines with half or delayed doses.
9979,They are the de facto experts on their vaccines and it is \_extremely\_ telling that none of them are willing to OK it.
9980,‚ÄúYeah so we literally have no social safety net to help you guys cuz we defunded or neglected them all and just had the schools pick up all the slack for shit like food and childcare.
9981,"Now that we‚Äôre in a situation where it‚Äôs dangerous to do that we literally have no backups, but money is king and we need our ~~human capital stock~~ workers to get back to work so we‚Äôre gonna need you guys to open your schools back up and put your own lives at risk because we were too greedy to effectively plan for something like this."
9982,"Don‚Äôt worry though, your sacrifices won‚Äôt be in vain."
9983,Shareholder dividends are gonna be killer this quarter.
9984,I hear the incoming administration might actually make a memorial for your sacrifices o7‚Äù
9985,Where in Ontario can you go into a hardware store?
9986,"It's all curbside, same with cafes and restaurants

I mean, shut down cafes/restaurants?"
9987,How will people get food?
9988,"Especially those who can't bring food for work because of lack of facilities, time, shift work and etc?"
9989,"I would argue that if NZ, and AUS had been in the same situation with the disease widespread there would have been the same difficulties with people disobeying rules."
9990,I think this comparison is more fore Asian countries that culturally will do as they are asked.
9991,NZ and AUS do not fit into this category
9992,No and no.
9993,You can overdose on D-vitamin.
9994,Most western people eat food that are enriched with D-vitamin so it is not a problem.
9995,If you believe you have this problem consult a dietician or a doctor.
9996,"This can all be dumbed down to: ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know what effect, if any this variant will have on the vaccine‚Äù."
9997,A bit irresponsible of UK officials to come out with statements like this when they really don‚Äôt have a conclusion on the effect this will have.
9998,Exactly...
9999,The R number of a virus is the average number of people an infected person will infect.
10000,It‚Äôs a snapshot that is backwards looking.
10001,R numbers vary based on mitigation efforts and social behaviors.
10002,It is a backwards looking snapshot.
10003,A one month lockdown will reduce the R number significantly.
10004,I never said it was the actual spread and my previous comment makes no assertion as such.

10015,[removed]
10016,Haha me too!
10017,üòÄ
10018,just a waste of time.
10019,you think however you want.
10020,i can guarantee you restrictions will not be lifted at the snap of a finger.
10021,things will gradually get lifted.
10022,life wont go back to normal until we reach herd immunity.
10023,masks will be required in public until then.
10024,The government is not lifting that mandate.
10025,people will still be required to socially distance.
10026,theyre not going to lift everything when people are still spreading the disease lmao.
10027,"you can dream all you want, but that is the reality of things."
10028,"so no, things wont go back to normal at a snap of a finger."
10029,its a gradual process.
10030,"2 things:

This is just one vaccine."
10031,There are several others.
10032,Also Tremendous progress will happen with even a small percentage of the population getting vaccinated.
10033,"Once we've got our highest risk citizens vaccinated, Covid will effectively be just another flu and the pandemic will for all intents and purposes be over."
10034,Canada is also much smaller.
10035,"Bahrain apparently wentvwith sinopharm, so they avoid the need for deep cold."
10036,"Israel has some unique advantages that give them a leg up, but still impressed."
10037,Maybe this is 100% not practical but I feel like we could have fast tract some kind of ‚Äúvaccine specialist‚Äù position.
10038,People could do whatever is needed to get certified and then could administer the vaccine.
10039,"Propaganda has been improved by technology, that's why this is all happening not long after the internet came out."
10040,You can make and distribute propaganda for pennies on the dollar of what it used to cost AND without much fear or media corporations being able to stop you because there is pretty much always a place that will distribute anything these day.
10041,That didn't exist a few decades ago.
10042,Media was much more expensive and premium so just corporations own internal publishing standards were much higher than something like Facebook or reddit.
10043,Beyond just the fact it cost a lot more you also had a lot more media that wanted basic publication standards while for internet media the lack of publication standards is part of the selling point.
10044,Humans have always been prone to media based propaganda.
10045,"That's kind of been clear since the printing press was invented, but with every new media like radio and broadcast TV and cable and now the internet you have periods of minimal regulations where the new medium can do max damage before society adapts."
10046,"Hitler used the advent of FM radio to wow people and get one unified message out to everyone vs having it filtered through newspapers and interpretation, they even subsidized radio production to get these radios out to the public because it was already known how powerful propaganda could be even back then."
10047,In this case it's even worse though because they completely sabotaged their career while falling for easy to google lies.
10048,It would be like a pilot that doesn't believe in gravity or an electrician that doesn't believe electricity can kill people.
10049,Undergrad+4 yrs of pharm school now.
10050,At one point a bachelor of pharmacy was enough depending on the state.
10051,Not sure if he's old enough for that.
10052,Get a large enough population and you'll find a few snowflakes.
10053,Plus social media finds a way to manipulate your weaknesses.
10054,Not defending the guy just wanted to comment on how scary misinformation has spread this year.
10055,Some ppl i know irl seem to be living a different reality.
10056,I love the way you put it here.
10057,"Each state is playing to its strengths, so true."
10058,"I also think each premier has, for the most part, the approval of the people in their state."
10059,It's still a new vaccine and would need to go through the minimum \~3 months of phase 1 and 2 trials before even considering jabbing people for a broad phase 3 or EUA usage.
10060,"This is the only ethical way to adapt the vaccine, period."
10061,"mRNA tech is cool and in some ways like legos for vaccines, but it's not without the same risks and issues as other vaccines (mainly that the immune response is too good and it causes your immune system to damage or kill you)."
10062,Nice!
10063,I love Lifetime.
10064,"I agree, hopefully only a few more months of masks."
10065,"Not going to burn mine though, don‚Äôt want to jinx it lol."
10066,I feel this pearl clutching is going to make the rollout so much slower that it will actually harm more people in the end.
10067,"While bureaucrats sweat over ""did one 27 year old get it before an unhealthy 61 year old without internet"", the 27 year old continues to spread the virus"
10068,Closes the biggest vector of transmission?
10069,(schools)
10070,I don't see how this is surprising regardless of covid19 cases.
10071,"People think Thailand, Taiwan, new Zealand etc aren't also going to get vaccines despite no/little cases?"
10072,I mean it already looked bad when back in the spring the rich were still getting their elective surgeries while no one else was.
10073,You think the rich have morals to not build their own hospital while us peasants have wait 2 days to be seen and decide to just die at home from sepsis instead of in the hospital parking lot?
10074,It's easier to blame someone else for your incompetence than yourself.
10075,\&gt;What they aren't is leading.
10076,Then which agencies are leading?
10077,The EMA doesn't look better than the FDA from the sciencedirect link.
10078,"E.g., the EMA doesn't test for clinical efficacy of new devices whereas the FDA does."
10079,"Schools aren't safe, but they shouldn't be among the first things to get closed either."
10080,"According to data we have about school closures here in Finland, especially younger pupils suffer greatly from the lack of in person teaching."
10081,"We don't want to set back a whole generation of kids, so closing primary schools should only be done when there's no other option."
10082,Which is where the UK is at now it seems.
10083,Good.
10084,It is the only thing that really works.
10085,Pleading with people only gets you so far.
10086,We don't know.
10087,That's the whole point.
10088,The vaccine was tested based on a certain protocol and that's the protocol we should use.
10089,"Ikr, not to get ugly but they could do a lot to suppress it if they wanted to."
10090,I also think it would happen gradually because of it takes time before everyone who wants to get vaccinated gets it.
10091,The que is long.
10092,But it's definitively possible to return to normal because of most part of the world has been very eager in the international work.
10093,meanwhile cuomo and bdb continue their dick-measuring contest instead of showing true leadership
10094,Seems like a job made for the National Guard.
10095,"Hey if that ever happens again and nobody else is available, i'll hop on the next flight to wherever you are."
10096,Cograts btw!
10097,Most states aren‚Äôt opening vaccination to the general public but to healthcare workers and long-term care facilities.
10098,The governors sure seem to want the restrictions in place as long as they can.
10099,A grandpa checking in.
10100,"4 minutes, tops."
10101,Then stop.
10102,"I have had a good life, and while I would like a good bit more I don't want one minute as a brain damaged, drolling plant."
10103,Hopefully my wife will empty my wallet and tell the EMTs to have a few beers on me.
10104,Or if I had just hit the ATM some good scotch.
10105,Life is not like a TV show.
10106,Why?
10107,"What happen with the ""15 days to flatten the curve""?"
10108,Did they meant a year and half by 15 days?
10109,"My Grandma got her first dose yesterday in Tel Aviv, so jealous."
10110,Her appointment wasn't until next week but her brother in law was going with his wife and they took her along and the doctor gave it to her early.
10111,That's not how science works.
10112,Consensus takes a long time and this virus is moving rapidly.
10113,Life isn't about absolutely; it's about probabilities.
10114,People need to understand that with each mutation the probability that the virus will be able to defeat the vaccine increases.
10115,"Like LA county, right?"
10116,The biggest hotspot in the entire country?
10117,But then you'll just say the 12% who live there and vote republican are the cause of this.
10118,You're a political hack and its so evident.
10119,Meanwhile in florida they're basically all the way open and have far fewer hospitalizations than either state
10120,This guy is being truthful.
10121,"Honestly, since the end of summer I've seen little effort to maintaining the rules."
10122,"I would argue that mask wearing is very widespread, but everyone did flock to the beaches in the summer."
10123,People are meeting up and ignoring rules.
10124,There are parties and raves everywhere.

10126,"I was honestly caught off guard how quickly we went from 200,000 daily cases to 300,000 daily cases."
10127,None of the previous spikes shocked me too much but god damn the holidays spiked that HARD.
10128,Where do you live mate?
10129,"&gt;deaths and hospitalizations were down in NY for months and things weren't normal

We didn't have a vaccine that time."
10130,This time we do and life can go back to normal once deaths are down to an acceptable level.
10131,Which will come once the most vulnerable are protected by vaccines.
10132,And it's inexpensive to boot.
10133,Thanks!
10134,"I may have used to work there üëÄ actually just got a new job and sprung for my own bike so thankfully I can bike mask free at my house 

I never tried that one though."
10135,The employee ones I broke out when sweating with them on and then the regular surgical ones sucked too.
10136,Hopefully not too much longer of this
10137,"That sounds amazing honestly, why don‚Äôt we have Iceland in the US?!"
10138,We also hate to cook
10139,"Yeah, I don't get it."
10140,One of my closest friends at work is in the Caribbean right now.
10141,It makes me think less of her...
10142,"People ignore tier 4, it's a last ditch effort I think."
10143,"LOCKDOWN is scary, people take it more serious."
10144,The effects of this should not be understated.
10145,People did not pay attention to the tiered system nearly as much as the original lockdown.
10146,[removed]
10147,"Yeah, with the south african one."
10148,"Check r/COVID19 , it's more scientific and data-based."
10149,They think it will not affect the vaccine significantly
10150,What you and me gonna do bruv?
10151,I‚Äôm sure we all understand what you are trying to say   but articles like these are or no use.
10152,They read out like tabloids.
10153,The general public needs consensus from scientists and authorities not it might or might not.
10154,"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonine_Plague

The Antonine Plague killed 5 million and is broadly believed to be a contributor to the fall of the Roman Empire."
10155,"Though not known for sure, the 2 most likely culprits are smallpox and the measles, both are caused by viruses."
10156,Its worth noting the difference in global population during the Roman Empire compared to today.
10157,"Yes CoV-2 is serious, and yes people should treat it is as such."
10158,"But it is nowhere near the most deadly or dangerous virus we've had, and if you expand to bacterial infections as well then the bubonic plauge (black plague) comes into the picture."
10159,You choose weather vaccinate or not.
10160,The Israeli arabs mostly don't want.
10161,China hid reporting the virus when first discovered and then wouldn‚Äôt let scientists from other countries enter China to get an understanding on the outbreak.
10162,"BOTTOM LINE, CHINA IS RESPONSIBLE!"
10163,He could always spend his time golfing during a national crisis.
10164,[removed]
10165,"We went from the best healthcare system in the world, to battlefield triage."
10166,What would you prefer?
10167,What would you do if it were your choice?
10168,"Sounds like he was miserably (but not dangerously) sick, is worried about catching it again or passing it on, and isn't fully recovered."
10169,Some are certainly getting positive test results long after deemed recovered and it's reasonable to worry if you are infectious when you test positive.
10170,"Current consensus is that they probably aren't and it's essentially false positive, but worrying about it isn't wrong."
10171,I would rather have them allow public to get vaccines now at this point - if there are so many people refusing to get vaccines even when they have a chance to get one.
10172,If you was trying to show your ignorance you couldn't have picked a better post.
10173,"We know the long term effects of all the other corona viruses, this one isn‚Äôt that special it‚Äôs just more potent."
10174,Click bait would tell ya we haven‚Äôt ever seen these effects before but they are all known effects of the other Corona viruses they just aren‚Äôt rare effects like in the other ones.
10175,For most people covid is between nothing and a bad flu as far as symptoms.
10176,He might be old enough that he was grandfathered in to only needing a bachelors degree in it instead of a PharmD.
10177,"Regardless, I know plenty of otherwise educated people who believe in stupid shit, but most of them don‚Äôt understand RNA/DNA that well."
10178,The vaccine is definitely no worse than actual covid in terms of unusual reaction risks so this guy is a dumbass.
10179,"Yes the mRNA makes your cells produce the viral spike protein so some people worry about that, except an actual covid infection also makes your cells produce that protein, plus all the other shit that‚Äôs much more likely to cause serious autoimmune type reactions."
10180,"Yes, they have!"
10181,"At present, the variant is referred to as ‚ÄúSARS-CoV-2 VOC 202012/01‚Äù (i.e., the first variant of concern from 2020, December), or ‚ÄúB.1.1.7.‚Äù"
10182,And while anaphylaxis is indeed deadly serious it's also easily treated with adrenaline.
10183,If you have an epi-pen at each injection site you're fine.
10184,That will save the person until they can get to the hospital.
10185,I have read it is because there is no system in place.
10186,No where to sign up for a vaccine.
10187,No database.
10188,It is on top of the list of things to do for the Biden administration.
10189,This was posted by an EMT in r/Losangeles but got downvoted and people said it would never happen
10190,Thanks.
10191,It‚Äôs super scary that CA is at the point they are at right now.
10192,"I‚Äôm in AZ and while we aren‚Äôt *that* bad yet, our rapidly climbing case counts would leave me to believe that we‚Äôll be rationing care soon too."
10193,I hardly leave the house unless I have to and I‚Äôve got my head on a swivel even more than usual when driving because the hospital is the last place I want to be headed right now.
10194,Stay safe.
10195,I‚Äôm sorry that a lot of people are making your job harder and more stressful than it should be.
10196,&gt;otherwise Iceland being an ‚Äúisolated island‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt have twenty times the number of deaths per capita.
10197,That doesn't logically follow.
10198,"Just because one thing is an advantage, it doesn't mean that it's the only thing that matters."
10199,A country could have a geographical advantage and still have a worse outbreak due to other reasons.
10200,And another country could have a geographical disadvantage and still do better than another country due to a better response or another reason.
10201,Maybe.
10202,Maybe.
10203,Just maybe Florida shouldn‚Äôt have sent all its Pfizer vaccines to just five hospitals?
10204,"And then when they got the Moderna sent that too to those five hospitals, with shipments happening earlier than shipments to the 168 hospitals in the state that didn‚Äôt get any Pfizer."
10205,Six months to plan a state rollout of the vaccine and DeSantis BLEW IT.
10206,You don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about.
10207,"I would say ""well at least in prison he'll get the help he needs"" but remembered it's the US when he'll be imprisoned for profit."
10208,The FDA has released a statement against handing out half-doses of the mRNA vaccines.
10209,They cited a *lack of data* suggesting that half doses would be effective.
10210,"So, that‚Äôs that."
10211,"Every country has under reported their cases, it was a lack of testing."
10212,Yet you seem to expect expect China to do better than your country.
10213,"The bottleneck isn't with the people giving the shot, it's with the people receiving it."
10214,Theres so many restrictions on who can get a vaccine that it's hard to get the right people in the right place at the right time.
10215,New York is a great example.
10216,"Cuomo says he will punish hospitals who give shots too slowly, but also punish them for giving shots to the wrong people."
10217,It's a Catch-22.
10218,If you want to give shots quicker you need to increase the number of people eligible to get them.
10219,U.K. here.
10220,"My son has had a regular click and collect order from our local brewery since March last year, it has enabled this small excellent brewery to keep in business during the pandemic."
10221,He has adhered to the rules above and beyond the Govt advice.
10222,"If the brewery can no longer do this, they will fold, yet my son can go to a supermarket and buy mass produced shit with no problem whatsoever, mingling with the great unwashed!"
10223,What a pile of crap.
10224,"If I‚Äôm not mistaken, with a low enough dose, a person could catch the virus, causing a challenge to the immune system that can create ‚Äúantibody escape‚Äù and this a vaccine resistant form."
10225,"If we immunize a large group of people with only half a dose/1 injection , no booster, then we run the risk of now being able to create an effective vaccine against severe illness."
10226,Not a scientist tho!
10227,Just one of the concerns for using the vaccine ‚Äúoff-label‚Äù.
10228,should let nature do its job
10229,[removed]
10230,The question is how did your economy not tank?
10231,Did everyone get government checks for that time?
10232,Serious question: Have those variants been given official scientific names yet?
10233,"Yeah exactly, hope things kick off as soon as possible"
10234,The episode with the live to win song?
10235,"And the guy on the radio told me that it was a small private plane that hit the first tower, it‚Äôs chaos when news breaks."
10236,"I mean come on, does it make sense at all that a news organization with thousands of civilian employees would somehow be informed of the attack before it happened?"
10237,Why would anyone who attacked the buildings do this?
10238,Spill the beans in advance for a better put together press release?
10239,"And somehow they wanted the reporting so precise that they got the press release set up before hand, but then dropped it before hand?"
10240,Try and be objective there bud.
10241,"There‚Äôs plenty about 9/11 to make you go hmm, but that a news org would get the info you said they got, keep it secret for the days and weeks they had it, only to drop it moments early?"
10242,is just absurd.
10243, - called chinese fire drill as NO organization will always result in such mess.
10244,I know Illinois has distributed almost all doses that our state had access to at this point but we actually have  plan in place in doing this
10245,"Not really a lot of complacency, these few cases have gotten everyone worried again, masks are back on and people are taking precautions."
10246,Being a good role model is first and foremost.
10247,He couldn't even do that.
10248,"""Chyna Viruz"" ""Fake deaths"" ""big stupid masks"" ""it's just a flu"" ..."
10249,I could go on and on.
10250,"It's in East Asian culture to wear masks during flu season etc or in this case, at any fear of a respiratory illness."
10251,"During swine flu in South Korea, masks were everywhere too even though the swine flu wasn't especially deadly."
10252,It is.
10253,"Conspiracy theories work by using logical illusions, the same way that optical illusions work."
10254,"Even if you know it's an optical illusion, you can't help but see it."
10255,It's the same with cognitive bias.
10256,You need to learn going against your intuition.
10257,"Unfortunately, school doesn't teach much of that, a lot of education is about learning things by heart."
10258,September wedding!
10259,We postponed from September 2020!!!
10260,"Wish us the best for family, friends and merriment."
10261,And dancing!
10262,!
10263,"Ugh I don‚Äôt even know whom to be mad at anymore, he‚Äôs an asshole for going into work sick, but he probably had to for the money so the employer‚Äôs the asshole for not giving paid sick leave."
10264,I‚Äôm glad I don‚Äôt work.
10265,Lol I know COVID-19 isn't funny but I read the title as Steakhouses prove to be hothouses.
10266,Think of yourself and the propaganda you fall for.
10267,One of the current ways is that people only get their information from hiveminds like Reddit.
10268,And this is America the Superpower.
10269,We‚Äôve let Trump crash the system and his no-mask followers have fueled this different kind of California wildfire.
10270,Having to triage based on survivability.
10271,SMH
10272,Would albuterol even do an iota of good for a COVID victim?
10273,This is a bullshit lockdown.
10274,I work at a coffee chain in one of the worst hit areas in the UK.
10275,We are still being forced to go to work and serve customers.
10276,"You can't buy your children clothes, you can't go and visit anyone outside of your bubble, but you can go to a coffee chain and order drinks."
10277,Fucking bullshit.
10278,"Best graphics/stats I‚Äôve found so far for IFR, ICU capacity and cases per 100,000."
10279,"California has a lower IFR than my state by .08, but 80% of ICUs in the state are at capacity."
10280,"It‚Äôs 70% here (VA) but our governor hasn‚Äôt done anything past a mask mandate, curfew between 12-5AM, ‚Äúreduced capacity‚Äù for indoor dining (yeah right) and no alcohol after 10."
10281,There is no ‚Äúessential only‚Äù either.
10282,So my mall I work in is 100% open for business and not enforcing masks indoors well at all.
10283,"So if this happened here, we would be screwed af."
10284,You mean the CHINA VIRUS right?
10285,You are saying the strain is the South African strain but when people labeled the virus the CHINA VIRUS early this year their was an uproar!
10286,Virus came from China!
10287,whoosh /
10288,Lol like I'm talking about super-secret information.
10289,Go to worldometers.
10290,"Where i live everyone wears a mask, but half aren't using them correctly."
10291,"Either have their nose out, have a mask with a vent or just a completely ill fitted mask."
10292,I live in Northern Italy and I'm genuinely curious to know where you heard about anti-mask behaviour here ahah I don't think I've seen a person not wearing a mask in months.
10293,Even my family that lives in Southern Italy (which is generally less prone to following rules compared to the North) says that everyone is wearing masks everywhere all the time.
10294,Rhetorical question i guess.
10295,Everyone knows the answer
10296,Yes but Wuhan is pretty far from North Korea.
10297,"North Koreans usually live and in the province of China by the border, where there's a large population of Chinese-Koreans who are bilingual."
10298,"Since you need to take a train or plane from Beijing to get to North Korea, probably there's few people traveling direct from Wuhan to NK."
10299,Every day i check if they have approved the two vaccines.
10300,But they're taking their sweet time !
10301,"Hopefully once it's done we can get rolling, because the vaccination stations are already up and staffed from what i gathered."
10302,Just the fact that I can't go drink beer in a bar makes it not worth it and also hiding my beautiful face under a mask it's really annoying.
10303,This.
10304,Papers to come shortly that will provide concerning initial data reads.
10305,"WRONG again, dumbass."
10306,"If I've done even a little bit of research about these vaccines, I'm willing to bet I'd know a shit ton more than the nurses refusing to get the ""5g"" vaccine."
10307,&gt; Why would there be?
10308,"It's been predicted and expected this entire time

I too can make things up and argue them as fact, but in reality the data has shown month after month that infection with COVID does *not* have short-lived protection against reinfection, and previous infections with SARS-1 or other coronaviruses can even fend off reinfection or severe cases."
10309,"&gt; Yeah, because few people have had the opportunity to catch it twice with a long period of time in-between."
10310,"So your argument boils down to ""It *could* happen, we just don't have sufficient proof for it yet, but just trust me and wait for it!!!!"""
10311,"Yeah, I can see how that grift would work if your gullible or just stupid."
10312,I'm sure you must feel proud that this is what you do with your time.
10313,&gt; Considering the entire pandemic started 9 months ago.
10314,COVID has been spreading since last year.
10315,&gt; Here in the valley we were in the fist wave of outbreaks.
10316,there has been ample time here for people to catch it again.
10317,In this magical valley where no there coincidentally are no articles to back up your claims and say nothing about the exact numbers in your town or the cases of reinfection.
10318,How stupid do you think people are?
10319,"According to the research from your county, a whopping ~2% were confirmed to be infected."
10320,"If we extrapolate that to your town, a whole SIXTEEN PEOPLE would be sick."
10321,"How coincidental that those 16 people seem to consist largely of you and your friends, who also, anecdotally, have been infected not just twice, but thrice!!!!"
10322,"Wow, and no one has taken the time to publish a single article about this statistical anomaly or comment on it, even in the very article that was written last week about the testing done in your very county."
10323,&gt; Whatever you say you couldn't even read the article you googled.
10324,"I read the article, and it contained facts, not fairy tales from a random shmuck who has an agenda to push for some fucking reason."
10325,Maybe you have nothing better to do with your time?
10326,Who knows.
10327,Cuomo got such a pass from his handling from the media and this site.
10328,Did you know he ordered positive covid-19 patients back to nursing homes at the beginning of the pandemic?
10329,So much truth.
10330,I fully support the Good News flair :P
10331,California is mostly fine.
10332,La is not fine.
10333,"I don‚Äôt have a breakdown of Arizona, but I‚Äôm assuming their cases are more spread across the state."
10334,I'm a former Army medic (now a physician) and we knew how to give shots in the field.
10335,"EMTs, Paramedics, Veterinarians, Medics, ex-Nurses... all of them know how to do it."
10336,Think of how many people give themselves insulin shots for diabetes.
10337,The backlog due to manpower is unacceptable.
10338,What‚Äôs it like being inbred?
10339,"2 questions:

1."
10340,Would we expect to start seeing a lot more reinfections (people who caught the original virus and then the new variant).
10341,2.
10342,It seems like they are fairly confident the mRNA vaccines can be adjusted for new variants if required and that it may take around 4-6weeks.
10343,Would the adjusted vaccine need to go through the same testing process for safety and/or efficacy?
10344,(Which would delay the rollout).
10345,I‚Äôd also assume production would need to make changes as well.
10346,What is it then?
10347,Utter stupidity?
10348,It's odd that someone can be highly educated and still be so GD stupid.
10349,It must have something to do with cognitive ability.
10350,This is false.
10351,The FFCRA (first coronavirus bill) requires companies to pay 80 hours for someone who is sick or in quarantine.
10352,If you are aware of a situation where someone isn't getting their legally required compensation you should refer them to the correct legal authorities.
10353,"Scientists who specialize in this field even stated China has under reported, not reported and not forthcoming with their data."
10354,And YOU trust China?
10355,Are you the CCP?
10356,!
10357,"2 questions:

10358,Would we expect to start seeing a lot more reinfections (people who caught the original virus and then the new variant).
10359,2.
10360,It seems like they are fairly confident the mRNA vaccines can be adjusted for new variants if required and that it may take around 4-6weeks.

10362,(Which would delay the rollout).
10363,I‚Äôd also assume production would need to make changes as well.
10364,The mutant strain is absolutely here already.
10365,Look at massachusetts and Florida and LA...look at the rates of infection spiking across the country.
10366,And even with this incredibly grim information.
10367,Cuomo has declared schools can stay open cause they're safe and transmission isn't happening there.
10368,But admits it spreads on a community level.
10369,Isn't a school a community?
10370,I am beyond grateful for the privilege I have to homeschool my kids.
10371,It is absolutely horrifying reading how teachers and students are being treated.
10372,How are people more concerned about a scary vaccine..but okay with sending there kids to school?
10373,There are no morals or principals...just endless stupidity coming from everyone.

10380,Only 6% of India's population is elderly and they have less comorbidities (like obesity).
10381,The pandemic isn't as serious over there even at its worst.
10382,This is not your fault but what you just posted is world salad nonsense.
10383,"Some public health expert has figured they have the chance to limit alcohol consumption and has jumped on it, while neglecting the indeed social benefits of consumption."

10387,"hey, if you want to play at China's level, if you think USA is just as ignorant as China."
10388,Go ahead.
10389,What I described above was the reasoning in an article I read right before the vaccines were released.
10390,"That is what is suppose to happen, which would cause delays compared to a seasonal flu shot."
10391,In not expert and I do not ha e first hand information.
10392,At this point I'm just a parrot.
10393,"I wasn't talking about you, I was talking about the sentence you quoted from the article."
10394,"Knowing how long would it take to modify a vaccine against a new antibody-escaping variant is a crucial information in any case, regardless of the current situation."
10395,"thats your opinion, I have my own in reading the article"
10396,I was a combat medic.
10397,Got out 2 years ago.
10398,I gave out shots for my Soldiers every year.
10399,I could teach someone how to give a shot in 2 minutes.
10400,It's not like it's complicated.
10401,the thought of were we would be without covid measures really is frightening.
10402,"There is that possibility, yes, but as there is evidence for cross-immunity from entirely different coronaviruses (the SARS immune response being effective against COVID), there is reason to hope that the immune response will be good against the new strain."
10403,"You must be forgetting that he actually promised it by Election Day, even when experts were practically shouting from the rooftops that it was not going to happen."
10404,"While the only hindering he has done has been downplaying the virus, what has he done and what resources has he allocated to promote a swift rollout?"
10405,"The federal government has more shots allocated to them than most states, why can‚Äôt our massive military be used to assist in administering the vaccine?"
10406,"Man, that was my first blizzcon, I think I still may have pictures of that guy from when I attended."
10407,"Oh, I found one actually

[right side of picture](https://imgur.com/eMGvpkH)"
10408,I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre being downvoted.
10409,There are many other experts who have said that delaying the second dose isn‚Äôt something that is catastrophic and the focus should be saving lives now.
10410,"Ashish Jha, Bob Wachter, Akiko Iwasaki, and others support delaying second doses, as there is no evidence that delaying a second dose for a few weeks would inhibit the efficacy of the vaccines, and some protection may be better than none for vulnerable populations."
10411,They should at least be doing trials to see if one dose provides adequate protection because that could be a game changer.
10412,This new strain is going to clobber the U.S and there isn‚Äôt time waste with complicated vaccine delivery systems and reserving doses.
10413,"The focus should be saving lives, and if we don‚Äôt get high risk people vaccinated, we‚Äôre going to have hundreds of thousands of deaths that could have been prevented because vaccines are not going into people‚Äôs arms."
10414,"I‚Äôm not saying that delaying a second dose is perfect, but when looking down the barrel of the new strain, non-perfect choices have to be made in order to save as many lives as possible."
10415,Stuck in a spacetime anomaly.
10416,It is exclusively intended when talking about American politics and voter turnout that the numbers are being compared against previous elections *in the United States.

The end."
10418,"Everyone i know who was vaccinated just had to wait in a large waiting area, they did not need close monitoring."
10419,That should not be the cause for the delay.
10420,I live in New Jersey and I was just listening to how New York schools are operating.
10421,A week ago the gov declared they all need to shut down because the rate of infection on the community level was at 9% and if it got over 5 the city and schools would shut down so hospitals won't get swamped.
10422,So today he gov changed his mind!
10423,Open schools he says..they're safe he says.
10424,Community transmission is bad..schools are safe.
10425,How the fuck is it not being transferred in the school community??!!
10426,"Brain dead watermelon...

Anywho so I'm watching from new jersey..as the nightmares from UK come in..and america twiddles there thumbs going ""can't get much worse!"""

10434,Such a dove.
10435,"Lack of firm leadership early in the game, means the decisions get made for you later on."
10436,"No, if the person first in line doesn't want it give it to the person second in line."
10437,No need for it to no longer be free.
10438,That would create an incentive to not find people that can get it for free so you can sell it instead.
10439,How can you say no?
10440,"Of course obesity plays a role and the US as one 
 of the fattest country in the world obviously has more patients dying because of that."
10441,Same is true for Germany and its super old populaton
10442,6 weeks is what experts are saying.
10443,6 weeks to modify an existing vaccine.
10444,Then there' the logistics which seem to be a hurdle.
10445,What I'm concerned about is conflicting opinions from the scientific and medical community.
10446,The average person doesn't know what to believe when some experts are concerned and others are not.
10447,That‚Äôs not entirely true.
10448,"He gets it to the states, the states are responsible for how they administer it."
10449,The states do have some blame here.
10450,"So what, they just leave a dead person on location?"
10451,If you are calling the strains by their country of origin shouldn‚Äôt you call the virus the CHINA VIRUS?
10452,I wish mask wearing had become normalized to the extent that people would practice better hygeine when they had a cold in public places.
10453,"I was hoping for next summer, summer 2020 I wrote off"
10454,"I can't wait to stop wearing a mask, but many Asians who have worn masks for years are not sick and delusional"
10455,He actually specifically addresses that we have tons of vaccines but no good system to distribute them.

10532,"Here are the real numbers, from Fauci yesterday."
10533,1/2 million vaccinations per day over the past 3 days.

10633,They said don't hoard N95 masks because they were in short supply and needed most by medical workers.
10634,If we kept the spread low by social distancing then there was no need for masks.
10635,Unfortunately nobody listened to them and the guidance changed.

10651,It could have been a patriotic duty for companies selling masks to sell them to hospitals etc instead of the general public.
10652,People who had masks(that could be verified to be genuine) at home should be nudged towards donating them to medical workers.

10667,Age is an exponential risk factor.
10668,"If a 30 year old with a BMI of 35 gets the virus, they have double the risk of a non-obese 30 year old."
10669,But if a 70 year old gets the virus they have more than over 40x the risk of dying.
10670,Please try to prove me wrong.
10671,I feel like this just one giant social experiment.
10672,Are people going to follow directions and do the necessary hard lockdowns needed to keep shit under control?
10673,or would people prefer to drag it out and half ass it with a soft lockdown.

11150,People did in New Orleans when our bars were closed all summer.
11151,There were still people hanging out on Bourbon Street even with everything closed.
11152,I think that will reduce your risk greatly.
11153,I would wear a mask too.

11206,"So, looks like we'll be in a never ending cycle of new variants needing new vaccines, until people say 'enough's enough' and decide to just get on with their lives"
11207,The goal with masks shouldn't be 100% protection but to slow the spread of the virus long until vaccine can be deployed.
11208,Society places too much emphasis on silver bullets or cure all's.

11237,It's not *terrible*.
11238,"At risk of having my comment removed by mods, I'll tell you the current thinking: The UK variant changes the spike protein enough for it to infect your cells more quickly."
11239,It's unclear why that has not lead to greater severity.
11240,"Meanwhile, the SA variant includes basically that same change (genomically), but also a few others."
11241,It seems to change the spike protein even more.
11242,The *concern* is that some people's current immunity will not match it well enough.
11243,"And it's possible that some ""traditional"" vaccines also will not match it well enough."
11244,The good news is that the mRNA vaccines can be adjusted quickly.
11245,"In theory, they could include mRNA against 2 or 3 variants in the same shot."
11246,People are not giving mRNA technology enough credit.
11247,It *might* save us.
11248,"Or we might be lucky and the more traditional vaccines will suffice, which is even better."
11249,"But I am very happy to have the mRNA vaccines as a back-up plan, in case this South African variant turns out to be problematic for existing vaccines."
11250,I don't think it's time to panic.

11353,"A lot of top virologists/immunologists/etc - people like Florian Krammer, Eric Topol, John Wherry, Angela Rasmussen - are flashing red lights at the single dosing/delayed second dose idea for this reason:

Since we don‚Äôt know how strong the immune response to a single dose would be during a long wait before an eventual booster, it‚Äôs possible that you‚Äôre creating a huge reservoir of ‚Äúhalf vaccinated‚Äù people walking around with enough immune response to tamp down the effects of the virus, but not enough to quickly neutralize it."
11354,"The virus would have a huge selective advantage with the only-partial immune response (an ideal environment to linger and mutate), which gives it plenty of time to mutate against a weak antibody pressure, until all kinds of escape variants could arise."
11355,Most mutations would hopefully be benign.
11356,"But you‚Äôre taking a pretty big chance that these mutants could significantly evade the current vaccines, or, in a worse case scenario, get unlucky and have a more lethal variant arise."

single dose sounds good, but applying selective pressure to viruses through weak immune response on a large scale is Russian Roulette."

11425,*
11426,&gt; So why even run phase 3 trials if we're going to ignore all the phase 3 data anyway?
11427,Could've started all this shit back in August rather than wait until now.
11428,Exactly.
11429,Now you're getting somewhere!
11430,"(But really, Phase 3 gave us additional confirmation that the vaccine had no medium-term effects, which was helpful)

&gt; Not to mention, the bottleneck right now doesn't seem to be the total number of available doses, but rather the rate at which these vaccines are going into people's arms."
11431,"Right now, the idea of halving the dose does not increase the pace, correct."
11432,"However, when we reach the point where vaccinations outpace supply and people are still dying and getting sick in droves, we better be ready to consider this."
11433,"In the meantime, we should collect as much data as possible on this as a strategy."
11434,"On the other hand, ""first doses first"" does increase the pace, because we're able to jab more arms with the same number of vaccination staff/locations, without having to bring those people back a second time for longer."
11435,"It may not double the pace, but it will increase it."
11436,He's dumb.
11437,That's not how exponential spread works.

11441,Yeah.
11442,I miss stores SO BAD.
11443,But every time I'm tempted to go in one I think about the janky ventilation they generally have and remember nothing in that store is potentially worth my life.
11444,"its such bullshit,  and i feel you, because we can see some semblance of a finish line.."
11445,Wonder which cabal did he suspect was distributing these tainted meds?
11446,"The Illuminati, Bilderberg, Paris Group, Xenu's forces?"

11448,"China is also supplying low income countries, at the same time as itself."
11449,"(contrary to many countries pledging to donate their excess at an indeterminate time in the future)

Look up Covax for a systemic approach to the issue of vaccine inequality."
11450,No it's not an Excel Error.
11451,"Hell is paved with good intents 

\- Need a medical doctor to prescribe the vaccine and patient consent (Seems to make sense, but slow down the process) 

\- They appointed a medical doctor (or a pharmacist) as director of the vaccine campaign (Makes sense, but that person admitted the he knows nothing about logistic and don't even want to care about it)

\- Patient in nursing home got first priority (again makes sense as it's the patient dying the most."
11452,"However, a lot of them aren't able to consent by themselves and nursing home are spread over the territory, so with the 2 previous points it's seriously slowing down the campaign) 

Government is already updating the strategy : Medical professional over 50 working in the hospital storing the vaccine batch can already get vaccinated, and vaccination centre will open to welcome people over 75."
11453,Meaning that 2 other *high risk category* will get vaccinated without waiting for the Nursing home batch to finish.
11454,We built field hospitals.
11455,We graduated HCWs early.
11456,We stocked up.

11478,"\^\^\^\^ THIS

Pre-Covid, for cardiac arrests, you are suppose to stay ON SCENE and do high quality CPR until you got a pulse back."
11479,"If no pulse is returned, you are not suppose to transport to the hospital."
11480,The patient has the best chance of ROSC (Return of Spontaneous Circulation)/ surviving if you stayed in the field performing good quality CPR.
11481,Transporting and performing CPR in a moving ambulance decreases chance of survival.
11482,"No ROSC, no transport, declare dead on scene."
11483,"If ROSC is achieved, YES, transport ASAP."
11484,"For like 95% of cases, this is pre-pandemic rule and they are just reaffirming it."

11500,It‚Äôs literally their job to know exactly that these medicines do and how they work in order to inform the people that are about to take them.
11501,My only thought on this is that the mRNA vaccine got his conspiracy mind going and he assumed that it‚Äôs like a form of reverse transcriptase like a lab created retrovirus that‚Äôll literally inject itself into your DNA.
11502,HIV virus does this with its RNA.
11503,Perhaps he knew enough about it to be extra crazy.
11504,"I mean it‚Äôs kinda like what a virus does in a cell, it hijacks the cellular machinery to make its own proteins."
11505,This vaccine is doing the same thing but the mRNA breaks down after a while and stops making proteins.
11506,There is definitely no retroviral component where it gets incorporated into your DNA though that would be super cool!
11507,Imagine a lifelong vaccine where the proteins used to protect you are added right into your DNA for the rest of your life!
11508,Don't be rude.

11513,Some scientists are genuinely corncerned.
11514,"You're absolutely right, if he was concerned about the danger posed to the recipients of the vaccine, doing this does nothing except increase the immediate danger (possibility that toxic effects develop as it spoils) and increase the chance of the recipient getting COVID since they will likely drop some precautions believing themselves to be protected."
11515,"Best guess, he's thinking of the long game and specifically trying to get stats out there that vaccine recipients are still getting COVID -- but that could only be the case *if he actually believes the vaccine is effective."
11516,*
11517,"From everything I am seeing there is concern that traditional vaccine efficacy might be effected because of the mutation in the spike protein, as for the mrna vaccine they program the body to attack a shit ton of aspects of the spike protein so there is not major concern that this new variant will have an effect on those vaccines, over time it will become likely that we will need to update covid vaccines but since the testing phase has been concluded reprograming the vaccine to attack the virus can be done in weeks with much quicker roll out similar to how we get a yearly flu vaccine."
11518,maybe she got a fancy wheelchair
11519,"Sure, but if I have vaccines that are about to go bad and there are some folks walking around outside who may want a vaccine that it would be _illegal for me to administer_, I throw the vaccines into the trash."

11713,"First measures in Europe were taken in the third week of February when Italy closed off the Codogno area after the hospital had already been overrun, some two days into the notorious Venice carnival, which was then cancelled at short notice."

11846,Here in Serbia 65% of the country is anti-covid-vax.

11849,Yeah.
11850,I understand that.
11851,I‚Äôm think more shorter term during the pandemic.
11852,Because there is so much transmission of the virus it will mutate faster now than it will once it‚Äôs under control and transmitting less.
11853,"So if, hypothetically, it was to mutate within say 6months or so in a way that makes the current vaccines ineffective would they need to retest an adjusted vaccine for efficacy, which could take some time, before rolling it out?"

11866,Fucking idiots.
11867,We don't know that giving the vaccine in red coloured rooms doesn't stop the effectiveness.
11868,Why has no one studied this?
11869,Where's the data?
11870,Hopefully all the vax makers are working on possible new ones just in case as well as testing their current one against them.
11871,"this is one more reason as many countries as possible need to be testing for variants to keep an eye out for more difficult variants

if for some reason one vax is better than another on a variant countries can direct that brand to the areas with the most cases as well as actually enforce mask rules and other measures to reduce spread

11908,Not dissimilar from the constant death toll updates but never breaking it down by demographic to quell panic.
11909,The goal seems to be to incite panic and fear so one will run to the savior vaccination.
11910,Just recently there was a piece written about how if seniors died immediately after taking the vaccine we shouldn't infer the vaccine had anything to do with it because these people are old and near death to begin with.
11911,"Ironically, this demo makes up the overwhelming majority of deaths from this virus and the virus is always credited for the kill whether it actually was with COVID or from COVID."
11912,One situation goes to play up virus deaths and the other scenario goes the opposite and concludes if the vax was involved they were just old and ready to die anyway.
11913,Vitamin D and other vitamins and minerals have been linked with prevention.
11914,How often do you hear anything about that?
11915,The way the media presents the news it as if vaccines are the only way.
11916,Many would probably argue to the death over this because they've been programmed to believe that way.
11917,There's very little balance.

&gt;Garder la deuxi√®me dose en r√©serve √©tait initialement une consigne venant directement de Pfizer."

Translation: Keeping the second dose in reserve was originally a direct instruction from Pfizer."
12000,"But now that deliveries are ""guaranteed for the next few weeks"" until the end of January, the manufacturer says there is ""no longer any issue"" with using all doses immediately."
12001,"Basically, Quebec is using all of their first doses now considering Pfizer's promise that deliveries will be made on time."
12002,This strategy was already adopted by Ontario and supported by the federal government.
12003,Don't let Reddit Quebec-bashers fool you.
12004,True
12005,How so?
12006,We‚Äôve seen article after article of deniers suddenly deciding everyone should pay attention because they got sick.
12007,"So, why haven't they mandated hospital staff getting the vaccine?"
12008,Also where are you that half the staff doesn't want to take it?
12009,I'm just curious thanks
12010,This is the start of all the Christmas and New year numbers though.
12011,People still went to private gatherings at which nobody wears masks
12012,True.
12013,I know I‚Äôm just posting what I read
12014,"With millions of people being vaccinated, chances are that someone will die shortly after receiving the vaccine, from something completely unrelated to the vaccine."
12015,You‚Äôre a piece of shit
12016,Of course you would.
12017,The vaccine isn‚Äôt 100% effective and you can still spread it if you are exposed.
12018,Yeah and there are reasons that people are like this.
12019,I believe the real solution to most of our problems is to address wealth inequality.
12020,Money solves a lot of problems and if more people had financial freedom they wouldn‚Äôt be so pissed at the world and acting so selfishly and hating others (not always of course but I believe the vast majority).
12021,"There‚Äôs no reason why the wealthiest nation in the world should be giving tax cuts for a trillion dollars to the wealthy (which is enough money to go back to 700 BC and blow a million dollars every single day until 2020 AD) while being the same country where 20% of our kids live in poverty, which is one of the worst rates among developed nations."
12022,Then we‚Äôre constantly fed shows with people living better lives than us.
12023,No wonder everyone is pissed off.
12024,We need to vote out anyone who protects the rich at the expense of the poor and middle class.
12025,We need fewer billionaires and more millionaires.
12026,And nobody should be terrified of going to the doctor out of fear of being financially ruined.
12027,You should read the rest of my comment.
12028,"Since people are ok with blaming China for delaying, then we should be consistent and also blame the UK for the same thing."
12029,Thank you
12030,Painfully true.
12031,And I know people here in LA Co. who will tell you it‚Äôs all BS.
12032,I just thank God I got vaccinated yesterday so soon I won‚Äôt be a potential vector.
12033,They first have to get Trump out of the Whitehouse.
12034,Why are they?
12035,A pandemic and a war death toll?
12036,I wonder what is going on in China.
12037,They gotta have more outbreaks than reported.
12038,Right?
12039,"350,000+ dead in America alone and every case they discredit."
12040,One dies after getting a vaccine?
12041,It‚Äôs the end of the world even before any relation is established.
12042,"&gt; I‚Äôm not claiming that it will happen, just that it could."
12043,"yes, and I could shit out AMD processors."
12044,My argument was simply that a partial antibiotic course drastically increases the chance of antibiotic resistant strains due to mechanism of action.
12045,We do not really have any strong evidence for the same with partial vaccinations.
12046,"And yes, I do agree that it all comes down to DNA/RNA mutations/evolutionary biology"
12047,Jojo Rabbit had a different experience.
12048,"Unfortunately the EU settled on a diverse set of vaccine candidates, and failed to pivot to the successful ones in the summer."
12049,Both GSK/Sanofi and Curevac (German/Dutch company) received large orders that would have been better off as you said (with BNT).
12050,"As far as the government was concerned, they were obtaining vaccines through the EU initiative and so are tied to that outcome."
12051,The negotiations that happened there aren't exactly the fault of the government.
12052,I suppose you could argue they should have sidestepped the EU commission and simply purchased vaccines just for France.
12053,"But that might have caused an outrage about not being unified, or undermining the EU, etc."
12054,So it's a constant arms-race between the immune system and the virus.
12055,"If you take a static snapshot of part of the immune response (which to my very limited understanding is what convalescent plasma will be), the virus will evolve to escape it."
12056,"In a real live human, the immune system will (hopefully) respond to the changes as they are happening."
12057,&gt; There's no reason recipients of this vaccine couldn't wait in a waiting room with a dozen other adults.
12058,"* I mean, aside from covid."
12059,"It takes space, room, staff, supplies."
12060,"This isn't something that's been tested and proven for years, its new."
12061,It's not quite the same as taking your child in for routine shots.
12062,All day long.
12063,"Here is more data: https://github.com/govex/COVID-19/tree/master/data_tables/vaccine_data

Just picking one state at random, Maine's own vaccination web site says they have done 35,536 but the CDC data for Maine shows 31,663."

12076,SO.
12077,Lets do the same - they've accepted that reality.
12078,"They've accepted China was able to stop Covid-19, hence their argument."

‚ÄúSome scientists have expressed concern that current COVID vaccines may not be as effective against the South Africa strain due to certain mutations it carries."
12097,"However, Faucisaid: ""It does not yet seem to have a negative impact on the vaccine."
12098,"But it's important to continue to follow that in case things change."""

12575,I‚Äôve literally never seen someone get in trouble for it.
12576,If anything hospital administration gets mad when people call out
12577,the ussr lost like 20-40 million civilians... 90% of 20 somethings died in 4 years... 95% of those born at the birth of ussr died in ww2.
12578,so many deaths of caused ussrs pop to plateu 20 years later from lack of children.
12579,And this is how a pun-demic starts.
12580,This is what happened in New York back in March.
12581,Its not unheard of.
12582,Unfortunately.
12583,Such a common sense approach.
12584,unfortunately you cant fix the stupid that is currently going on in this world.
12585,Personally my theory is that a lot of it surrounds childbirth.
12586,It is the  one common high interaction event with medicine where medical interventions are so far beyond common they are practically standard at least in the US.
12587,Through our understandable aversion to negative outcomes we have developed a system that responds to the slightest abnormalities by yanking control from people and telling them they need to comply with drastic interventions or they are being irresponsible.
12588,We already know the history of episiotomies and have moved on from the once common practice that turned out to be unfounded and a cause of undue trauma.
12589,In childbirth and all other areas of medicine we need to vigorously seek out the episiotomies of today.
12590,"It is the when you're holding a hammer everything looks like a nail problem, and it will always be a valid reason to be wary of the people holding the hammers."
12591,Your opinion doesn't matter when the actual facts contradict it.
12592,"Of course there is, since healthcare workers are the ones coming into contact with the most covid patients and will therefore themselves end up in hospital beds, leaving them unstaffed."
12593,It does mean there's less reason to prioritize those that refuse though.
12594,I‚Äôm sorry are people not dying or am I missing something?
12595,Is it fear mongering so much as it is *presenting facts*
12596,I give it 1-2 months with the new covid+
12597,"Who the fuck cares, get the vaccine out."
12598,Bickering about the exact order only slows things down.
12599,It‚Äôs not about predicting.
12600,It‚Äôs about acting when you need to.
12601,And we failed..
12602,What do non-Americans refer to former military as?
12603,I always thought vets was universal
12604,what a fucking joke
12605,They‚Äôre fooling no one but the CCP bots on here and the rest of Reddit.
12606,Even as an American I was initially confused as well.
12607,"I mean, I know cats can get it and they killed all those minks who had a mutant strain...but that seemed excessive mortality even so and then - ohhhh, soldiers."
12608,Correct.
12609,The problem isn‚Äôt prioritization.
12610,It‚Äôs having a Russian asset in charge of distribution.
12611,"Gumming up the works is a feature, not a bug."
12612,Debatable given the mortality rate by age group and the young median teacher age in top of the number of qualified replacements compared to the negative effect of poor/missed schooling.
12613,You can‚Äôt just fire half of the medical workers lol.
12614,They‚Äôre a skilled position and would result in the collapse of the healthcare system
12615,"And, it's so 'dangerous' that the first people to get it are the rich, famous, and medical personnel as well as old folks?"

12625,Can we start off by debunking the misconception that one person's experience means almost anything?
12626,"Maybe your state is handling it better, but in California where I am the lower tiers are people employed in different industries like for example transportation workers."
12627,"There‚Äôs not really any age requirements as you move down, and it‚Äôs going to be way more difficult to verify than healthcare workers and nursing home residents like it is now."

12640,The US used to have the world‚Äôs greatest infectious disease response system.
12641,No longer.
12642,Pop-up outdoor vaccination setups are simple to arrange.
12643,Drive-in is an option also.
12644,America has.managed exactly this sort of thing quite well with tens of thousands of testing sites all over the nation.
12645,"Ah, ok."
12646,"The specific comment to which you were referring didn't mention Finland, and the comment before that was far up the thread because of other responses so I didn't see it."
12647,My apologies.
12648,My co-worker's sister is a nurse in the biggest town in a rural area of Oklahoma.
12649,Her and half of the nursing staff refused the vaccine.
12650,I'm assuming a bunch of people in that area will also refuse.
12651,So we have tons just sitting in rural Oklahoma while my wife and her fellow teachers aren't getting access yet.
12652,"Because  they wont pay people to stay home, all the feel good tv ads in the world won't pay the bills,  we are all in this together?"

12655,Are the rules for being a pharmacist different between the US and the UK?
12656,"Because in the UK you need a masters level degree I think, which is 4/5 years."
12657,So you can't be a dumbass.
12658,I'm hoping that COVID‚Äì19 is for corporate capitalism what Chernobyl was for the Soviet Union.
12659,"The difference is that Chernobyl only killed a couple hundred people (the 4000 estimate is based on the LNT hypothesis, now considered false) whereas COVID‚Äì19's excess death toll is likely over 2 million, and will likely have a total life-year cost in the nine digits."
12660,At what point did that start?
12661,"If it's any time after the virus had already taken root in the country.... oops, too late."
12662,Terrorist*
12663,So your own opinion is that China is at fault for being slow to declare human-to human transmission?
12664,There are people about to be intubated that will not wake up yelling that it can‚Äôt be covid because it‚Äôs a hoax.
12665,They literally died of the hoax they don‚Äôt believe in.
12666,Some people would rather die than re-examine their beliefs.
12667,"Thats pretty clever, that should be on those quality of life indicators for towns."
12668,Honestly I have zero expectations till the new administration comes in.
12669,The outgoing administration has packed it in even more than usual.
12670,They‚Äôre just treating it at this point of well I‚Äôm being fired anyways why the fuck bother with anything so just going to do nothing till I get dragged out of here
12671,Same people giving out fines to people for not having health insurance.
12672,Really doubt that stimulus check would even cover the money an individual would pay in health insurance overall for the year
12673,"Probably, I tried several antidepressants since childhood and sertraline seemed to help, but the side effects were pretty bad."
12674,"Nowadays I'm not taking anything and most depressive episodes are only a couple of days long, but it was very challenging as a very young kid when I had no idea of what was going on with me."
12675,Rest in power king
12676,The federal government is holding back the second doses.
12677,"If the hospitals do this too, we would be holding back most vaccines."
12678,One of our nurses wasn't able to get his vaccine because he didn't have the official hospital app.
12679,Our hospital is using the vaccine as a way to force people to download and sign up for their app.
12680,Why should he need that to sign up when he's an employee of the hospital?
12681,Seems odd.
12682,Scheduling of this vaccine should probably be done at a state level.
12683,Let's hope CVS and Walgreens can make the process easier
12684,This is strange.
12685,The US has **cut** the quarantine period from 14 days to 10 days based on the science.
12686,"https://www.voanews.com/covid-19-pandemic/us-shortens-covid-19-quarantine-10-days

But here we have China **increasing** the quarantine period for 14 days to 21 days, which one assume is also based on the science."
12687,Obviously both cannot be correct.
12688,So who is following the science correctly?
12689,Not to the corona fear mongers.
12690,New York nurse Sandra Lindsay on Monday became the first person in the¬†United States¬†to be fully vaccinated against¬†coronavirus.
12691,CHYEEENA

12695,"Sure, none of these vaccine decisions are easy and each has its benefits and negative aspects."
12696,We have to see what works in real time and it‚Äôs a terrible place to be so I hope these decisions pan out.
12697,"It sucks that we‚Äôre in this position with the vaccines not being produced and distributed fast enough, but with the new strain coming, we‚Äôre in a race against time and we need these vaccines to get to vulnerable populations so I‚Äôm praying we figure that out!"
12698,And who wants it.
12699,I think half of my hospital has refused

12704,"""It's not that serious""  - DeSantis probably"
12705,Don't worry I have reported
12706,This is ridiculous.
12707,"So vaccines were sent to a hospital, the staff turned it down, and now the hospital has to wait for permission to give it to other people."
12708,"The priority groups were great in theory, but with people turning down the vaccines, it is slowing things down way too much."
12709,There are huge numbers of people who want the vaccine NOW.
12710,"Open the vaccines up to enough people so that there is a supply issue, not an issue of finding enough demand in qualified people."
12711,"If you are going to prioritize a group, get a head count of who wants it first."
12712,My mom works at a congregate setting and this is exactly what was done - they polled employees to see who would want it and they are ordering that number of vaccine.
12713,Thanks for the reply.
12714,I was shocked to see how low they rank.
12715,I'm a firefighter/paramedic in the Midwest and this has been our standard for at least the last 13 years that I've been working.
12716,Someone in cardiac arrest who we aren't able to get their pulse back will be declared dead in the field.
12717,(with very few exceptions) The quality of CPR in a moving ambulance is not as good plus you have interruptions in chest compressions while the patient is moved to the stretcher and then loaded in the ambulance.

- blame China for delaying but not the UK 

- blame UK for delaying but not China

- don't blame neither UK or China for delaying

12779,"Since I do not agree with double standards, the only logical position is option 1, i.e."
12780,blame China for delaying and blame UK for delaying.

12789,"You're right we if totally locked down, nothing was considered essential then yes maybe yes in two weeks it could be all wrapped up."
12790,"But even in the most extreme lockdown, there will be social contact of some sort."
12791,Hosptial workers still need to treat patients so you have one source of contact.
12792,This with sickest people who might also get sick from their patients.
12793,Closing hosptials for 2 weeks is out of the question far too many would die for no good reason.
12794,People still need groceries.
12795,Another source of contact and this one with the general public.
12796,So other shoppers and other employees are exposed to potential carriers.
12797,"Although this can be minimized with click and collect, but not everyone has a car so then you need home delivery where employees are at much higher risk, especially when they have to enter multi-family homes (condos, apartments, etc)."
12798,"Goods and supplies need to be delivered to grocery stores, hosptials and other places."
12799,Another source of contact.
12800,These people might travel long distances and maybe even over international borders.
12801,Trucks need fuel so another source of contact.
12802,Again can be minimized by paying at the pump.
12803,Laws need to be enforced.
12804,Another source of contact.
12805,"High contact here, two cops in a car together and them coming into close contact with people they arrest."
12806,International enforcement with border guards and what not.
12807,Fires need to be out out.
12808,Another source of contact.
12809,Large crews need to go out in tight spaces.
12810,Communications need to be maintained including Internet services.
12811,So another source of contact.
12812,Many of these people need to enter people homes and businesses.
12813,Electricity needs to maintained.
12814,Another source of contact.
12815,These people may need to fly long distances to maintain lined.
12816,Food supply lines need to be maintained.

12818,Close contact involving hundred of employees in close quarters.
12819,Water services also need to be maintained.
12820,Another source of contact.
12821,Also might require someone to enter someone home.
12822,"Essential workers need to be fed, especially ones who are on the road."
12823,So fast food needs to continue to operate.

12831,People will not comply with restrictions once that happens and hospitals are at no risk
12832,We will need 1M vaccines a day since none of the states seems to have seen fit to have a registry of interest and fallback plans to deal with (expiring) doses refused by the people for whom they were originally intended.
12833,As if the government needs more excuses to shed responsibility.
12834,Give your head a shake.
12835,They didn\`t know it was a new type of coronavirus until late January.

12851,Can't you have that reaction to \*any\* vaccine though?
12852,We don't see that requirement for any other vaccine shot.
12853,So lives are now in the hands of EMT paramedics and volunteers who have to make that call?

12880,"As in how many doses are available that have been administered so far per country,   so far I just keep hearing that our vaccine rollout sucks and the US has vaccinated more per capita even though they have problems too .. but is there any optimism ours will ramp up?"
12881,Are you not seeing the tremendous scandal taking flight across the country?
12882,Im in Alberta and people have basically 100% lost faith in the government.
12883,We are just seeing the beginning of the carnage.
12884,Meanwhile Covid is just raging on.
12885,I‚Äôm getting sick of him.
12886,I can deal with him changing on masks but the fact that he thinks herd immunity will be around 85% but admitted that he lied to us about it being 70% until polls showed more people were willing to get the vaccine is unforgivable.
12887,He needed to be upfront because lying about stuff like that hurts everyone‚Äôs mental health by giving them false hopes and leaving them down a road of lies.
12888,Thank you.
12889,I must have misunderstood.
12890,"Florida has a higher population than new york state, so either way."
12891,"There are more people in the hospital with covid in new york than florida, right now, per capita."
12892,"Yes, everywhere is struggling (except the Midwest which is over the hump), but florida is doing great by comparison to other large states."
12893,If you have any data or facts to back up that Florida is merely pretending it's not struggling?

12921,That's how bad things have gotten with brain washing and misinformation.
12922,"Your argument holds for some worker in another field, but for those working with patients who are at risk the last thing they need is to get covid from their nurse."

12925,Israel is doing well... except that they are excluding the Palestinians from the master plan.
12926,"True, that totally slipped my mind although that's a criticism of Israel's priorities, not their ability to roll out a vax."
12927,Well - considering that a retrovirus inserts its own RNA into your DNA and your dna becomes virus code + your code.
12928,It is not farfetched to think an mRNA vaccine may do the same from scientific perspective.
12929,However we know thats not how mRNA vaccines work.
12930,Besides.
12931,changing DNA is not always a negative thing and researchers have been trying to use that as a delivery mechanism to fix genetic diseases etc.

12939,See my comment above with all the links to when all different dates were provided.
12940,And the question I had to begin with.
12941,"Nothing against him, I‚Äôm merely questioning what this does to someone (or the masses) psychologically and what it‚Äôs called."
12942,Jeesh.
12943,Tough crowd tonight.
12944,I come in peace!
12945,Have you read any Palestinian articles?
12946,They aren‚Äôt exactly pleased of apartheid vaccination plans.
12947,You gotta wait until someone replies to me.
12948,Silly alien.
12949,"While I would certainly not hesitate to make that phone call, technically a pharmacist has all the right to deny the dispensing of medication, whether for concerns of medical wellbeing or based on their religious/moral belief."
12950,It‚Äôs actually outrageous.
12951,"Usually most company policies dictates that if it‚Äôs denied because of a moral reason, that pharmacist must then transfer the duty over to another pharmacist but it doesn‚Äôt always happen."
12952,That still can't be the problem.
12953,"Even if you assume 50% of the country is anti-vax, there are still million of people who would want it."
12954,"Realistically, if you are at the point where the EMTs are called you aren't really healthy anymore."
12955,"Young people do get in motor vehicle accidents (or just regular accidents) or have freak medical issues that could put them into an unlikely to survive ambulance transport box, not often fortunately, but it does happen."
12956,"Right, I see what you are saying, forget the mask dip."
12957,So it needs to be taken orally so you can get a blood level high enough that it gets into the cells this virus targets.
12958,Which would require a dose which would be too toxic.
12959,"But some of those cells where the virus starts to infect are right there, accessible, in the the nasal epithelium."
12960,"If you combined a safe oral dose with a topical on a swab that can enter the nasal epithelial cells, you might get some higher prevention."
12961,"I am thinking of the form that is used for rosacea, used topically, probably formulated to be easily absorbed by epithelium."
12962,"Then for the pharygeal epithelium that the virus also likes, an oral form created to be thick enough to stay there in the throat awhile and be absorbed by those cells."
12963,"It is a lot of rigamarole for people to do as a prevention, especially when we have trouble getting people to wear simple masks, but some people with a lot of close contact with patients are already rinsing their mouths and swabbing their noses with Listerine, or povidone, so it might be useful."
12964,I never knew Ivermectin has been used for dengue.
12965,Wish I had known that 5 years ago when I had dengue.
12966,Not a fun infection.
12967,Reverse triage.

12969,It‚Äôs like that episode of South Park where scientists were baffled by how Magic Johnson managed to live with AIDS for so long and later discovered the miracle cure to AIDS is simply injecting pur√©ed cash into a patients body.
12970,&gt; his failure to punish and make an example of Dominic Cummings was when this lockdown started to go awry.
12971,Really?
12972,"So this 

https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1378480/london-news-new-years-eve-tier-4-restrictions-new-cross-south-london-pub-UK-covid-latest

is because Boris Johnson didn't make an example of Dominic Cummings?"
12973,Do these people in the picture even know who Dominic Cummings is?
12974,"It doesn't really matter to me whether that stuff is done by county, city, state, or national any which way the plans should have been made years ago and turn keyed as soon as the vaccine was available."
12975,"Whatever number of doses doesn't much matter either, say five hundred, they better have five hundred people ready to go, plus alternatives so they don't go to waste."

12984,He is saying he is the science interpreter.
12985,That‚Äôs his public job.
12986,His job isn‚Äôt to make political spin.
12987,He can‚Äôt have credible scientific authority when he has admitted to altering his actual personal predictions
12988,Been following this daily with massive amounts of research since December 2019 like a hawk.
12989,I appreciate the comment and your work.
12990,I really think you misunderstood my post and reason for it - it all comes down to the question I had.
12991,I am not questioning the act of moving dates or why (I get it my friend).
12992,Someone go check to make sure we didn‚Äôt go back to leaded gasoline.
12993,I live in Houston and go here for my myriad orthopedic issues.
12994,There‚Äôs primary care nurses there who‚Äôve told me (knowing I‚Äôm a physician!)
12995,they‚Äôre gonna try and get out of it.
12996,They‚Äôd play ball.
12997,I don't wanna share too much personal detail but this was in a Middle Eastern country and the way my mom described something in a text is this.
12998,"I'll copy/paste:

&gt; Dad talked to her this morning she was crying she saw him from the window on Monday he smiled at her she went in yesterday with protective gear because he was asking for her I think he was in a coma for a few days  

Now where I live nobody is going in to ICU no matter what."
12999,"Obviously health standards vary around the globe but I am thankful that she at least was able to see and be close to him, even if it doesn't sound like he was conscious when she was there."
13000,Now of course I'm worrying about her safety because of that but I didn't want to ask my Mom.
13001,I don't think it was appropriate when she was telling me.
13002,I'm sorry your Grandma had to pass on from this world alone.
13003,You didn't say if she had COVID and it doesn't even matter I don't think because I still think visiting sick and dying relatives in hospitals is prohibited regardless of their condition.
13004,I'm so sorry.
13005,Some people are not very bright.
13006,And some people aim their trolling to low-intelligence audiences.
13007,And most of those have had other anaphylactic reactions before.
13008,Shouldn‚Äôt be too hard to identify high risk people and watch them
13009,"Except that he admitted that he at multiple times knew science said one thing, and then decided to tell the public something else in order to deceive the public based on his own personal utilitarian decisions."
13010,That‚Äôs not his job.
13011,"His job is to just give the scientific interpretation expectations, not to arbitrate if ‚Äúyou can handle the truth.‚Äù"
13012,"yes she is still having me take it, but my blood values for D were inching towards the upper bracket of acceptable."
13013,so she had me lower the dose so i can be closer to the middle.
13014,so taking it without knowing what your current values are is not risk free.
13015,"lol, you're not the only person on Reddit who works in the scientific field."
13016,"I have collogues in labs and hospitals, and I don't know anyone in my cohort who's calling Fauci a liar."
13017,"If anything, he is constantly praised within the scientific community because he's one of the only government officials who's being transparent throughout this whole thing."
13018,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt;but the moving goalposts are undeniably intentional."
13019,That's literally my point in changing predictions bases on newly available data.
13020,I don't know why you have issue with this.
13021,Ugh... this isn‚Äôt even my real point.
13022,"But to help you with google...

But on top of these, we have our own POTUS giving countless timelines from Easter and on when everything will magically disappear."
13023,Countless times.
13024,So many leaders saying so many dates.
13025,The general public (well some) believe what they are told and take it to heart.
13026,"Regardless, I honestly do not care how many times they keep moving the goal post."
13027,All I was trying to find out was the answer to my question what this is called in psychology - and what it does to someone.
13028,"For example, a child asks a parent for a new toy."
13029,"Parent says, yes they will get it this weekend."
13030,"Weekend arrives, no toy and parent tells child next weekend."
13031,Next weekend no toy and says the next weekend.
13032,This process continues week after week.
13033,What happens to the child psychologically?
13034,What is this called?
13035,This is literally all I‚Äôm trying to get to the bottom of.
13036,"I do feel (and I could be wrong) that this would have quite a negative effect on someone psychologically, regardless of any of the details."
13037,Being told something is coming and constantly moving that something out has to do something to the normal person.
13038,Do they give up hope?
13039,Are they easier to control?
13040,Do they give up emotionally?
13041,Do they lose trust?
13042,Do they accept that it‚Äôs never going to happen?
13043,Do they get depressed?
13044,Or am I completely off base and this has literally zero effect on ones psychological well-being?
13045,"We are always one step away from that, it‚Äôs just we usually have some thin veils and barriers up to hide the fact."
13046,Correct.
13047,It got out of hand due to a failure of due diligence by those in charge and/or (lack of)leadership.
13048,They exacerbated the virus and its spread.
13049,"Then the strategy shifted towards prevention/ containment, and again, they botched that part of the pandemic playbook (what playbook, though,  they've been flying by the seat of their pants)."
13050,"You aren't containing a virus and its spread if you're actively urging your supporters to hold rallies,  go to super spreader events (sturgis, tulsa, etc."
13051,"), sabotaging your supporters by telling them to go maskless, etc."
13052,It's been a failure at multiple levels made worse by that which cannot be named on this sub.

13055,"Regarding the third paragraph, isn't this just unloading even more work on the local health department?"
13056,They probably don't have infrastructure in place to deal with all of the requests from people wanting to know where they are in line.

13190,Please read FDA docs carefully.
13191,"According to  [FDA News Release](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-takes-additional-action-fight-against-covid-19-issuing-emergency-use-authorization-second-covid) for  Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine:

&gt;The issuance of an EUA is different than an FDA approval (licensure) of a  vaccine, in that ***a vaccine available under an EUA is not approved***."
13192,"[FACT SHEET  FOR RECIPIENTS AND CAREGIVERS](https://www.fda.gov/media/144638/download)

&gt;The Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine is an ***unapproved vaccine*** that may prevent COVID-19."
13193,***There is  no  FDA-approved  vaccine  to  prevent  COVID-19.
13194,***     The FDA has authorized the emergency use of the Moderna  COVID-19    Vaccine to prevent COVID-19 in  individuals  18 years of age and older   under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
13195,"Official FDA instructions: [Emergency Use Authorization for Vaccines Explained](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/emergency-use-authorization-vaccines-explained)

&gt;How will vaccine recipients be informed about the benefits and risks of any vaccine that receives an EUA?"
13196,"FDA    must ensure that recipients of the vaccine under an EUA are   informed,  to the extent practicable given the applicable circumstances,   that  FDA  has authorized the emergency use of the vaccine, of the  known  and   potential benefits and risks, the extent to which such  benefits and   risks are unknown, that ***they have the option to accept or refuse the  vaccine, and of any available alternatives to the product."

13201,People who don‚Äôt want to follow the guidelines don‚Äôt because there is no repercussion.

13210,Is democracy failing?
13211,What?
13212,It's far to late at this point.
13213,The only thing we can do now is perfect the vaccine modification and quickly evolve the vaccines to respond to the changes in the spike protein.
13214,"Sorry, no habla jibber jabber."
13215,I think we will see some normalcy as cases die down from vaccination but I don't think we will see full normal until end of year into next year.
13216,I think a big part of it is two dose scheduling.
13217,"If one location is doing both, then there comes a time when so much focus switches to that second dose while additional, ramped up supply comes in that isn't going to first dose vaccinations."
13218,"It might have been a good idea to get the second dose at a different location, even if within the same facility, so that even as doses come in, they're split up and it ensures a smooth flow."
13219,"Personally, I think we're beyond all this and need to start stabbing everything in site as quickly as possible."
13220,"By the time we need to worry about single dose efficacy and new trials, we'll likely be awash in other vaccines and additional doses for boosters anyway."

13226,"I'm not sure when/if that county or its hospitals will call such a code, but seeing 8 hour wait times has got to be careening towards it like nothing else."

13245,What?
13246,"For the last few weeks during the COVID-19 surge, the region's ICUs have had 0% capacity available."
13247,"When there's no space at hospitals, ambulances have to handle the overflow."
13248,"This has resulted in some changes to how the region handles emergencies:  


* The public is being discouraged from calling 911 unless it's an absolute emergency."
13249,"* Ambulances are being told not to transport trauma patients - victims of heart attacks, gunshot wounds, car crashes - to the hospital if they can't be resuscitated in the field."
13250,* Patients who aren't facing a life-threatening emergency are waiting 12-18 hours in waiting rooms just to be seen in the ER.
13251,* Ambulances are waiting for hours just to offload patients at hospitals.
13252,* Hospitals are running out of oxygen.
13253,* Hospitals are setting up cots in parking lots to take in patients.
13254,"""We're trying to encourage people to not call 911 unless they really need to,"" Dr. Marc Eckstein explained."
13255,It is pretty disturbing.
13256,Covid has brought out things I would have never guessed from people I‚Äôve known for years.
13257,A few months ago I spoke to someone I know who is a doctor.
13258,He had several conspiracy theories about covid.
13259,And he said masks have been over hyped.
13260,He said we didn‚Äôt need masks because the amazing miracle of our human noses can filter out the virus.
13261,I was speechless.
13262,Edit spelling
13263,It's easier to knockdown a strawman than discuss real issues.
13264,"As a former student, I would like to echo that complaint."
13265,"Though, I can at least say my high school history teacher was amazing."
13266,"I‚Äôve been thinking this from the get go, a large scale quarantine/covid effort wouldn‚Äôt work because there‚Äôs to many moving parts in my opinion."
13267,You can plan and plan and plan but the 331 million people in the us are going to be a beast to control if at all.
13268,It's going to keep going because this virus cannot be controlled.
13269,People need to just accept that and move forward.
13270,"I live in an area that is currently booming with cases, and I have not been to a single place where I HAVEN'T seen people without masks and distancing, but yet it's still spreading."
13271,"People are trying their best, but the fact is unless we're talking about people sealed in their houses, this isn't going to end by lockdowns."
13272,Thankfully a vaccine is on the way
13273,I'm honestly waiting for a flat earther to fall off the planet
13274,"Sure the medical science might back this, but I think we also have to consider the social science  too."
13275,"Many people are already nervous about taking a ‚Äúfast tracked‚Äù vaccine, and the FDA have assured everyone it‚Äôs safe because they have done trials, taken time to review the data etc."
13276,"To change last minute and say ‚Äúwell actually, we know we told you that but now trust us this works too‚Äù could do tremendous damage to public trust, ultimately killing more people by less take up for vaccine."
13277,surely the UK can't afford another lockdown?
13278,Whats the economic situation?
13279,"I think this would work great in theory, but adds a lot of logistics, which could slow things down."
13280,I'd rather funding go towards paying people to work mass vaccination sites rather than paying people to schedule appointments based off the priority list.
13281,You didn't give a single example of him saying things will be normal in Spring 2020.
13282,"The earliest I found was this:

[Fauci: Country could start returning to normal by April 2021](https://www.wthr.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/fauci-country-could-be-back-to-normal-by-april-2021/531-7d292703-6842-45d4-bf8f-2f951f6b7143) 

Key word: ""start."""
13283,Also notice that he said 2021.
13284,"Yes, I was referring to the length."
13285,It was 112 days not 6-7 months
13286,Someone has to coordinate them.
13287,"It is still the same problem, regardless of how much help you have."
13288,America's problem is not that we lack any material or physical thing.
13289,"What we lack is leadership, planning, coordination, direction, purpose."
13290,"Now we have purpose and resources, but absolutely nothing else."
13291,[removed]
13292,"In the US , at the current vax rate, 250,000 completed 2 dose vax's per day, it will be 4 years to vax everyone."
13293,Fauci is urging a speed up.
13294,Normal vax points are planning to double their daily vax's.
13295,That changes the timetable to 2 years!
13296,"I'm saying that in best case scenario, 1/2 of the US will be innoculated in 12 months; that's absolute best scenario."
13297,"To break that out, in 6 months, at best 1/4 of the the American population will have been vaxed."
13298,"I repeat, 25% of Americans will have been vax'd 6 months out."
13299,And who will that be?
13300,"The elderly and if so, what's the cut off?"
13301,All the allied medical professionals recognized by the DHS as allied.?
13302,"School teachers and Administration, through the entire systems?"
13303,Everyone affiliated with fire and safety?
13304,What about front line workers?
13305,And essential service workers?
13306,"Oops, that's way over half the US."
13307,That means many of these won't be included.
13308,"Thanks to the current Administration's push for smaller government, the feds withdrew from the last mile of vax distribution, resulting in chaos and a sea of unpreparedness."
13309,See you in 2 years or 3 or 4.
13310,"You didn't read the thread, did you?"

13319,"Victoria had 112 days

You can still go out within 5km for exercise, get takeaway food, work, shop essentials in the city

Rural Victoria gets more leeway"
13320,Saw Instagram acquaintance eating and drinking in restaurants without masks and people sitting really close indoors like we are already post-Covid.
13321,Tagged Arizona as location and I thought maybe Covid is under control there?
13322,Who was i kidding.
13323,Very disappointed in said person and everyone involved
13324,You obviously don‚Äôt understand the everyone for themselves culture of America lol
13325,Oh that is true.
13326,"Limited ICU beds will mean ER will have increasing amount of high acuity patients boarding, which will impact waiting room times and ambulance wait times."
13327,"As load of high acuity patients increases and resources become limited, quality of care will decrease, and more people will die."
13328,But this article is not an example of that.
13329,Because the only vaccine they have at present is Sinovac and it wasn't tested on people over 59.
13330,"Wow, that's insane."
13331,Here in Canada health workers have to be put in a random lottery to get the vaccines because there is not enough supply to meet demand.
13332,How are these people even health workers?
13333,They're afraid of medicine and they are health workers?
13334,What's wrong with the US education system?
13335,Nothing is safe anymore.
13336,Every Government has been shutting down and people are still getting infected.
13337,Every government requires mask and people still get infected.
13338,What everyone should be focused on is distribution and access to vaccines and testing.
13339,When people need them.
13340,Shutting down doesn't work it's proven.
13341,"The only thing shutting down does is slow the economy, cause people to go unemployed, and essentially ruin the government's economy and cause more debt."
13342,Shutting down only works effectively in the beginning so the government can catch up with its process of researching and getting a vaccine.
13343,We are way passed shutting down and the governments who do shutdown are using Covid to restrict your freedom.
13344,We have the choice to keep ourselves safe in certain situations.
13345,"The government doesn't need to step in and tell us to stay in, not go to church, school, or even hangout with our family."
13346,we should decide depending on our own circumstances and health situations.
13347,It's called freedom and freewill.
13348,"Also, let's compare California to Florida."
13349,"Florida is Open, California is Closed."
13350,Florida has no problems with ICU.
13351,California does.
13352,"Florida has an open economy and life seems much happier their, while California's depressed, restaurants are doomed, and most owners lost their businesses."
13353,Btw you get $100 fine if you don't have a mask in certain public areas no matter if there's no one around you.
13354,Is that neccessary?
13355,Also let me ask a question for all of you.
13356,"If I got Covid and then I get the second strain and then I am fine after that why do I have to follow regulations and shutdowns when my antibodies have built up immunity to it, essentially I can just be around people with Covid."
13357,"Bottom line all governments are taking advantage of this opportunity to restrict freedom and to tighten things down, so that we make less decisions on our own and they can just clean our asses later in the future."
13358,"I do feel bad for those who lost their lives with Covid, but the governments are also destroying lives by shutting down."
13359,If I was in charge and covid caught me by surprise.
13360,Step 1: Shutdown hard for 90 Days the government will pay for your rent and food for 90 days.
13361,"no transportation, flights, etc."
13362,After 90 Days open all the way up.
13363,Btw I mean hard shutdown if the cops see you outside they'll take you back home and give you a warning.
13364,Second time your going to jail.
13365,"Step 2: Call Nation Emergency and require all pharmacy's, scientists, doctors to speed rush(this means stop everything your doing and work on the vaccine and research only) research for 90 Days no exceptions."
13366,This includes setup locations for testing and vaccines.
13367,Btw you can make a vaccine in 90 working 24/7.
13368,if the government forced all companies and scientists to work on it with speed and deadline.
13369,This includes testing.
13370,Step 3: Require all logistics companies in the nation to distribute a vaccine no exceptions.
13371,Any other work stops.
13372,Step 4.
13373,Starting with the most infected areas distribution will be prioritized.
13374,But within 90 days there should be complete distribution and testing everywhere.
13375,There should be 1 shutdown and that's it.
13376,Masks and 6 feet apart is bullshit.
13377,Would you rather patch the problem or nip it in the ass?
13378,"If all the scientists and healthcare companies work together as 1, I think it's possible in 90 Days."
13379,In 6 months the problem is fixed and my economy is booming.
13380,"There will be 3 stimulus packages after the shutdown to boost the economy and get it back to normal, and there will be a business package for all small business to stay open."
13381,"1.2K 4th month
2.2K 5th month
3.2K 6th month

For healthcare companies and logistic companies they will be funded for the speed rush in research and they will be given loans at low rates for helping the government out during these 90 days, although they will still be working for the government."
13382,They will be able to do other work and still do research.
13383,Heading 11 into this.
13384,"Had a bronchoscopy on the 22nd dec to see whats up in my lungs, still waiting on the results."
13385,"Miss getting out hiking, my knees are really paying for it."
13386,"On top of everything ive already had operations on both knees, and need to keep fit to keep them in order."
13387,Alas that hasnt been happening.
13388,Money.
13389,I am really wondering about this.
13390,A few comments in this thread with completely different thoughts on reauthorization and I can't find any good sources on the topic.
13391,"I can't imagine that a vaccine that produces a different antibody response could be ramped up for widespread distribution in weeks even if it only was a ""minor change""."
13392,Worst flu I have ever had.
13393,By far.
13394,Totally knocked out for a few days and sick on and off for like three weeks.
13395,"I coughed up jeez, it had to have been a quart and a half of green and yellow goo."
13396,"Had trouble breathing, fever, all sorts of awful."
13397,I even had this one nap during a fever... You ever fall asleep on a hot day with your face on your arm and when you wake up you have to peel your face off your arm?
13398,Remember what that feels like?
13399,"Yeah, I had that feeling in my lungs when I took a deep breath after waking up."
13400,Awful.
13401,Like inflating a wet plastic bag.
13402,"Had some friends travel back and forth to China just before that, and family was in Italy for business just before that too."
13403,"Anyways, I don't have antibodies either."
13404,"""That just means you're a good test taker"" as a reason why someone got into Harvard is almost as dumb as the covid denier."
13405,The only people who say something like that are people who couldn't do well in school.
13406,"He wants to pass a law making it illegal to give the doses out of order, and impose a fine if not all doses are given quickly."
13407,These are opposite goals.
13408,"If everyplace is required to give them in order, then they're going to sit unused if they can't reach the right population."
13409,Some people simply refuse to take it.
13410,What then?
13411,I get that he's trying to be proactive but he is not solving the right problems.
13412,You can work out at home.
13413,There are tons of videos on YT and such with ideas.
13414,Better to be safe than sorry.
13415,You couldn't pay me to go a gym right now.
13416,It is extremely unlikely that there will be any strain in the near future which can bypass the vaccine.
13417,"The worst case scenario is that the vaccine is slightly less effective against some variants, so maybe something like 80% effective instead of 95% effective."
13418,"Yeah you're right I can't confirm whether they had positives in March (will find out), but that makes me think that they didn't and just assumed it was COVID."
13419,"Was that Jimmy Carr, Bill Burr or Louis C.K."
13420,?
13421,"Jesus, that film."
13422,It's one of those ones where the luckiest characters die at the beginning.
13423,"Few points to address:

It‚Äôs never fair to homogenize people as a monolith."
13424,All healthcare workers are not equal and don‚Äôt think alike.
13425,Many want the vaccine some don‚Äôt.
13426,When a grocery worker doesn‚Äôt want a vaccine it‚Äôs very easy to kick them out and replace with a new one.
13427,With healthcare workers you cannot just find one off the street.
13428,It takes years of schooling and training from nutritionists therapists and nurses all the way up to doctors and surgeons.
13429,"Second, the hospitals don‚Äôt employ everyone."
13430,Many make deals with private practices.
13431,"If the private groups don‚Äôt like it, they‚Äôll go to another hospital willing to work with them gladly."
13432,"Third, some hospitals get government dollars."
13433,It becomes a little dicey (for example the debate about public schools mandating kids to get vaccinated).
13434,"Fourth, you‚Äôre absolutely right about nursing homes."
13435,The doubting nurse in a nursing home would argue it‚Äôs better to vaccinate the high risk patient and protect the community forever rather than expose the otherwise healthy vector with an unknown.
13436,And she isn‚Äôt necessarily wrong.
13437,It‚Äôs debatable for sure.
13438,It‚Äôs hard to mandate debatable topics.
13439,Regular school vaccinations are still debated even though the evidence behind that is extremely clear.
13440,I'm glad you have absolutely no power to enact this forced vaccination idea.
13441,&gt; Czech Republic is #1 in infection rate and the highest death toll since October per capita.
13442,That's so sad - IIRC they were the country who really took the lead with homemade masks early on.
13443,Okay thanks jw.
13444,"Just didn't know if you were in a more rural or urban setting, and it's pretty depressing that the 50% number is relevant to other hospitals."
13445,"If only half of our healthcare workers trust the vaccine, that does not bode well for the general population :/"
13446,So a gigantic probpem seems to be that the vaccine is there but the half of the people that are meant to get it refuae to take it but zhey also cam't give it to another group because of some priority bs.
13447,Holy shit.
13448,How stupid is this.
13449,That these people are healthcare workers is fucking insane.
13450,It's so contra productive.
13451,I haven't heard how/when they had planned to use those vaccines (and probably won't) but I agree.
13452,I'm glad at the amount of elderly I saw lining up though.
13453,Totally disagree even if you get more high risk people with this method if you can distribute 5x as many vaccines to general population in same time frame that‚Äôs going to do way more to stop community spread and protect those same people.
13454,Can we stop comparing a pandemic to man made mass death.
13455,The US to too disorganized to be carefully selecting the recipients.
13456,The vaccinations just need to be given to as many people as possible.
13457,They test cities of millions when cases do pop up with batch testing.
13458,I think they‚Äôre up to 30 or 40 a day recently but is still damn impressive.
13459,This is a fact that you can hardly mention lest you be branded a 'antivaxxer' unfortunately.
13460,"This fucking sucks, especially with the glut of vaccines on ice right now not being used."
13461,I'm probably just being judgy but AARP is a multi-billion dollar company with like 35+ million members that are ALL in a risk category - Have they stepped up in any way or has it just been them bitching about what everyone else is doing?

13809,So keep your hyperbole in check.
13810,I'm not saying that is the sole reason for the slow rates in Europe vs the US for example but it is one major point.
13811,Also your sources contradict yourself.
13812,"The BBC article states:

*The EU began vaccinating with Pfizer/BioNTech doses on 27 December."
13813,"* 

*The EU admits that limited production capacity has created ""bottlenecks""."
13814,"*

They say production is creating bottlenecks when according to you they just can't get consent fast enough."
13815,Sure.
13816,"Also in germany there are tons of ""vaccine centers""."
13817,"True, however they also start with  vulnerable people and medical staff first."
13818,But you need to be individually invited and get an appointed weeks an advance.
13819,And appointments were booked out for the next two weeks instantly.
13820,So this also suggests they are heavily limited by vaccine production/delivery.
13821,Also about half of the vaccine centers did not open yet because they did not get a shipment.

13826,We're not doing too badly in the UK.
13827,"But that's because good ole Boris wants Brexit Britain to be ""world-beating""."
13828,So he's putting the pressure on to get vaccines approved and jabbed into people's arms.

13836,"And then a return to more normal conditions with testing, contact tracing, and isolating outbreaks."
13837,Also Ivermeticin.
13838,"To put it in perspexrive of random chancw, take the US where the numbers are easy to come by-

Odds of dying in any 1 day are around 1 in 250000

US alone has vaccinated 4500000 in about 20 days, so around 2250000 a day

So you'd typically expect 1 person in the US to die on the day they recieved their vaccine, 2 people to die in the 2 days following

So one person dying 2 days afterwards, somewhere in the world, is very much expected."
13839,"I'm just surpised there aren't more stories like this, it makes for good clickbait"
13840,Denmark has the same proportion of vaccine to population as the rest of the EU.
13841,"They‚Äôve been quicker to vaccinate than some EU countries (France, The Netherlands) but I expect they‚Äôre about on par with a lot of EU countries which just haven‚Äôt reported numbers yet."

13879,The schools were safe enough to keep them open and close other partrs of society.
13880,Not because there was no risk there but because that spread was low enough that it could be compensated by reducing other spread.
13881,"The difference is that now every bit counts so schools, unfortunately have to close."
13882,"Nothing strange about that really, but the messaging could have been better here."
13883,"I would have refrained from ever trying to picture schools as somehow ""safe"" from spread (not sure what the wording has been)."
13884,There is limited (as in nonzero) spread in schools especially from small childern.
13885,"The older the children, the more significant it is."
13886,It's all a matter of how serious one thinks that is vs how serious one thinks shutting schools is.
13887,"Some people seem to think that so long as anyone risks being infected in a school, no one should be in a school."
13888,Others think that if the only price is a few tens of thousand dead then obviously months of school for millions is more important.
13889,This isn't an easy dilemma.

14149,&gt; The issue here is en masse rolling out partial coverage thereby exposing the virus to a much larger immune response; positive pressure as you say.
14150,&gt;  The difference between covid and other previous vaccines is we are harboring huge numbers of infected people who are still spreading and will continue to do so with the vaccines.
14151,"The 'partial coverage' during dose one (92%) to dose two of Moderna (95%), for example--  is greater than the public (but likely soon outdated) p3 net efficacy of AZ two doses aparts,  So by that logic we should not even begin to vaccinate with AZ."
14152,Sure escape variants  that is a (small) hypothetical risk that can't be denied.

14285,The system could weigh registrations by priority and schedule times and follow-ups.
14286,This appears to be completely missing in the vaccine rollout.
14287,Step 1:  make companies to spend time developing a safe vaccine.
14288,Step 2: make them take long trials for making sure it's safe and develop a safe medical procedure.
14289,Step 3: spend weeks/month reviewing  documentation of the trials for making sure the vacinne is safe as companies tested them.

14332,MY was included for the vaccine News and March
14333,"I'm sorry, Canada's health care is much more superior to the US, anything you say against it would be a lie."
14334,"&gt;so ridiculous, i dont think any sane person would rather have the doses go to waste

Nah, need to virtue signal loudly about prioritizing first responders (vs. those that might be more at risk of hospitalization and death as the Europeans are doing)."
14335,Brain fog is awful.
14336,People who haven't suffered from it have no idea how distressing it is.
14337,I hope you heal soon.
14338,"To be clear, what they must mean is that they have no data to support that spacing it out is an optimal strategy overall."
14339,There does appear to be data to support the idea that some immunity is conferred after the first dose.
14340,"From Pfizer's web site:

&gt; [‚ÄúWe are grateful that the first global trial to reach the final efficacy analysis mark indicates that a high rate of protection against COVID-19 can be achieved very fast after the first 30 ¬µg dose, underscoring the power of BNT162 in providing early protection,‚Äù said Ugur Sahin, M.D., CEO and Co-founder of BioNTech."
14341,"](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-conclude-phase-3-study-covid-19-vaccine)

So basically, the UK is taking a semi-calculated risk."
14342,Will the benefits of getting to less immunity to more people be greater than the benefits of getting more immunity to fewer people?
14343,"The latter will better protect those who are vaccinated, but the former might slow the spread faster."
14344,BioNTech is right that there's no proof that the UK's approach is better.
14345,But there's also no proof that the other way is better.
14346,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think BioNTech's trial only studied (and only could have studied) what happens to individuals who are vaccinated, not what the total effect is on a population."
14347,"I can totally understand why BioNTech wouldn't like this, though."
14348,"If people who have only one dose get sick, the main thing people are going to think is that BioNTech's product didn't protect them."
14349,"Inevitably, some people will (wrongly) blame BioNTech even though the UK government chose not to follow the procedures."
14350,Ironically on Facebook he stated that this group represented the population of Wyoming.
14351,"But according to the US census, there is a population of 578,759 as of 2019 (probably not accounting for all of the covid deaths I would think)."
14352,Yes
14353,There does not seem to be any serious consequences for mayors or other political elites.
14354,The mayor and his wife received monoclonal antibodies.
14355,The hospital only received 50 doses per week (7 doses per day).
14356,Only 5 other people will receive the antibodies that day.
14357,Maybe.
14358,There is a possibility that our ability to administer it always falls behind our ability to manufacture it.
14359,We don't know that yet.
14360,"What we do know is that CURRENTLY, we are producing it more quickly than we can administer it, which makes the current talk of half-dosing ridiculous."
14361,I agree; do what was studied.
14362,"We also don't have time to ""waste."""
14363,"I know we didn't have a vaccine a year ago, but an entire YEAR of time was wasted."
14364,"As far as I'm concerned, this is a new year, let it be a year defined by a complete vaccination response and not haphazardly ""firing a machine gun with vaccine-bullets into a crowd."""
14365,"This will take an entire year to do (and that's optimistic at the rate we are going), but do it right and don't half-ass it."
14366,"I don't wanna waste my time but if it's gonna be another year of wasted time, I want something done collectively and by-the-book during that time for once."
14367,I'd be curious to see the breakdown by education level.
14368,I suspect this resistance is amongst the less educated and would like to know.
14369,Sadly it seems that this might be the way to actually convince people that the vaccine is safe.
14370,I find this baffling.
14371,A lot of people refusing the vaccines are supposedly educated.
14372,"Even with evidence based medicine from good quality clinical trials, people would still rather rely on anecdotal data to help guide their decision making."
14373,Maybe we can also throw in some celebrity endorsement.
14374,It's not a race y'all.

&gt;	For individuals who started the schedule and who attend for vaccination at a site where the same vaccine is not available, or if the first product received is unknown, it is reasonable to offer one dose of the locally available product to complete the schedule."
14412,"For the millionth time, ‚Äúa clinical trial exists‚Äù does not mean we have results from that clinical trial."

14421,"Not if you are Asymptomatic.. not knowing you were infected, not showing symptoms, just happily spreading covid."
14422,"Thanks, Trump!"
14423,"can be the new Thanks, Obama!"
14424,The article suggests that the risk from schools is pretty minimal.
14425,It seems that closing them is a last resort since the government is out of other options to try to slow the spread of the virus.
14426,Not sure if the closure will have much of an effect on cases / hospitalizations / deaths.
14427,"1796 to be exact, cowpox was purposely used to infect people to give immunity or milder symptoms to smallpox."

14605,What do we know about the new strain from the UK?
14606,Is it 50% more contagious?
14607,Is it as heavy on the symptoms and does it have the same mortality?
14608,"No I don‚Äôt, though I know I‚Äôve read it in a few different places."
14609,I also know this is why you have to get a new flu vaccine every year.
14610,The virus just mutates so much that even though you‚Äôre immune to last year‚Äôs strain it doesn‚Äôt matter because that strain has already mutated so much that you‚Äôre no longer immune to this new strain.
14611,This happens literally every year and it‚Äôs also why the flu vaccine is only about 50% effective or so.
14612,The stuff mutates so quickly that scientists have to predict what the strain is going to be like months in advance so they can determine ahead of time what vaccine to start producing.
14613,It‚Äôs a lot like weather forecasting and thus can only be so accurate because you‚Äôre shooting at where you think the target is going to be in 6 months and there‚Äôs a lot of stuff that can change in that time period.
14614,Spanish flu had much the same mutagenic factors and the time frame even works out pretty well too.
14615,Lasted just about 2 years in total which would give it just enough time to mutate into something less deadly.
14616,"I‚Äôll have to do more research on this myself, but if any of this sounds like a familiar plot point to a classic sci fi novel for any of you readers out there, that‚Äôs because this was actually one of the plot drivers of the Michael Crichten (of Jurassic park fame) novel The Andromeda Strain."

14629,"Change my mind: Any young and healthy person who decides to not take the vaccine is a selfish prick who puts their own health above that of their family, loved ones and other vulnerable people in society."
14630,"If you don't vaccinate yourself and end up infecting your elderly parents or grandparents, that is blood on your hands."
14631,"It makes my blood boil when you see people use the reasoning that :""I'm not likely to be affected by covid anyways, the chance of suffering complications feom the vaccine is higher than the risk of dying from the disease, so I won't take it""."
14632,"Even if you are scared or unsure, just fucking grow a pair of balls and take one for the team."
14633,"The ONLY way to stop this pandemic is to stop the young, socially active age groups from spreading the disease on"

14657,How likely that the US reaches 5% vaccinated by the end of the month?
14658,Pretty likely I hope?
14659,I think they're saying their entire stockpile would be useless and they'd have to start producing the new vaccine variant batches from scratch.
14660,Apologies if I sound cynical but after 2020 ‚Äúwe as a country need to prepare‚Äù part just made me lol.

14667,If the US put as much effort into healthcare as we do the military we would be the healthiest country in the world.

14669,Nurses already jump around jobs more than practically any profession I‚Äôve ever seen.

14671,Its a percentile thing.

14675,Not half doses.
14676,Half OF the doses.
14677,"So if there's 10m doses available, 5m go to the priority groups (because distribution is going slowly), and 5m go to the general population to just get as many people vaccinated as quickly as possible."

14789,I run about 20 miles a week and I could barely complete my typical 3 mile loop without walking 2-3 times for a couple months after.
14790,This is because we haven‚Äôt studied yet whether vaccinations eliminate asymptomatic carriers shedding the virus.
14791,We will know the answer soon as more people get vaccinated and the testing completes.
14792,"My prediction, and I‚Äôm right a lot for what it‚Äôs worth, shedding will be reduced significantly."
14793,They‚Äôll know this In mid February.
14794,Each state will have their own goalposts in terms of what percentage are required before they start relaxing.
14795,Some will have if you‚Äôre vaccinated you‚Äôre free to be normal.
14796,There will be backlash and debate as to whether that‚Äôs legal or not.
14797,By April or may southern/right-leaning states will be 100% normal and NY/CA will be relaxing significantly while pushing to cross the 70% barrier for total vaccinations.
14798,The three biggest hurdles towards normalcy is 1) proving vaccinations eliminate shedding the virus if this doesn‚Äôt happen it‚Äôs fucked.
14799,2) getting the critical mass vaccinated.
14800,3) proving those who have antibodies can be exposed and don‚Äôt shed more virus if reinoculated thanks to their immunity (this will take a little longer to prove).
14801,"If all three of the above are true, with 20 million cases already and presumably majority with antibodies, a million vaccines a day, by April half the population will be vaccinated or have antibodies (more lax states open) and a couple months later the rest follow."

&gt;Governors of New York and Florida vow to penalise hospitals for slow rollout

So the problem is NOT that we are running low on vaccine doses."
14875,"Maybe at some point the idea of giving one dose should be looked at, but today is not that day."
14876,I work in a group home for adults with developmental disabilities.
14877,It's a pandemic with a million deaths.
14878,What did you think we were going to do?
14879,"""well sure some of you will die..."
14880,"But I NEED to be able to drink my Starbucks at the location it was made"""
14881,So 74 new deaths.
14882,Lovely
14883,"""Everyone"" is convinced?"
14884,Really don't think so.
14885,That‚Äôs a very totalitarian answer.
14886,"This is Williamson County, Tennessee."
14887,It's only available if you're 75+ at this point and the sign-ups filled up basically right away.
14888,"Other counties in Tennessee (not Davidson, where Nashville is, but Shelby and Hamilton) have started rolling out to 75+ as well."
14889,Don't know if they take non-residents.
14890,Places in Florida might.

14927,"viral vector vaccine was actually has quite similar mechanism with mRNA vaccine if I'm not mistaken.. they just have different delivery method (mRNA vs another virus)
  
if they want a more traditional one they should wait for Novavax.."
14928,Let's take a step back real quick.
14929,Your point was that things are going to slow down because it's going to be hard to verify employment.
14930,And my point was that we will be able to get out large amounts of doses to those age groups.
14931,It's going to be relatively easy to get 75+ year olds the vaccines.
14932,That's going to be doing the bulk of the heavy lifting in terms of efficiency.
14933,"Yes, I do agree that verifying employment will be more challenging, but between on site vaccination clinics and paystubs, I think we are going to be able to handle that challenge."

14971,"(To be clear: Losing our World War II vets is sad, and marks the end of an era, and every person is a loss to their friends and family."

14978,For sure it is.
14979,The coverage of it though is a tad disingenuous.
14980,The point here u got the 2nd dose already... anyhow agree to disagree.
14981,I wish that we had taken any of the necessary measures to make schools reasonably safe.
14982,"At least around here, we've only taken half-assed bullshit measures."
14983,"My brother was getting depressed after doing remote learning so he opted to go back to school when they reopened, but after seeing so many students refusing to wear masks and not taking it seriously, he has decided to go back to remote school until things are safer."
14984,Without other measures in place it's just a shit show any way you look at it.
14985,"I really wish stricter measures had been enforced, from the beginning, with comprehensive matching support (financial, educational, health &amp; safety etc) for the American people."
14986,It would have made it much more feasible to reopen schools.
14987,So from now on I shall have to refer to antimaskers as merely cultists of nurgle.

14992,&gt;England's lockdown is supposed to end on December 2.
14993,It's not December 2 yet.
14994,Wait and watch before claiming it's over.
14995,&gt;It was supposed to last 3 weeks the first time around.
14996,The pointless restrictions are still there.
14997,Just because you have decided for yourself that the lockdown is over does not mean it actually is.
14998,People don't exist solely to go to work and go to school.
14999,Well here's your original quote from a month ago.
15000,That lockdown ended.
15001,People were packing the streets.
15002,So apparently they end.

15008,"Basically the company cannot say something like ""Hey if you want to keep your job, we need to chop off a finger."
15009,"If you don't like it, you can quit, but this is the only way to keep your job""."
15010,I e-mailed the Vindicator and asked them to clear this up.
15011,Just waiting on a response.
15012,&gt;Lets be real no one is following lock down protocals.
15013,Lots of people are following protocols.
15014,"People on here have been very worried since the guy‚Äôs comment, it is good to post actual data that shows vaccines will work."
15015,If only they were allowing Palestinians to do the same :/
15016,Police tend to be more right leaning and conservative.

15056,"great news, but not anything people didn't see coming."
15057,"unless your only source of information is the Hancock guy from the UK you probably knew that the ""will the SA variant affect vaccines"" question was a matter of not affecting them at all or a small chance of making them slightly less effective."
15058,more importantly- this variant has been seen *before* in other places besides South Africa and has failed to become dominant.
15059,"even with its extremely rapid transmission in Africa, AND if vaccines were SIGNIFICANTLY impacted, there's almost no chance it could out-compete the B117 strain before mRNA vaccines were able to be altered."
15060,It seems like there should be a more aggressive recapture system for transferring unused vaccines in hospitals into the long-term care facility vaccination program.
15061,[Overall the UK is only a bit ahead per capita in testing (far right column).
15062,](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/)
15063,"If this keeps up throughout society at large, the United States will not get out from under the virus for many many years."
15064,So risk getting fired or .5 to 1% chance of getting critically ill with chance of dying.
15065,"I'm not sure I would gamble on that, not for a \~$40k salary."
15066,The real disaster is that they have been forced into making this decision in the first place.
15067,2.8 million Americans die every year.
15068,"I'm sure many of those deaths if you looked into it, would outrage you."

15082,speaking as a professional dock worker i find that hard to believe
15083,We have no evidence the vaccine wipes out the virus.
15084,Please read the study I linked from the researchers themselves‚Äîthat question wasn‚Äôt even asked let alone answered.
15085,It's my point of view.
15086,It's not an agenda.
15087,There was just an article about Gov Cooper in NC doing this.
15088,Hopefully others will follow suit and the process will be sped up immensely and soon
15089,What law does it break?
15090,Could anyone explain why viruses become deadly.
15091,Is there an evolutionary pressure for viruses to become deadly?
15092,"If not, then is the reason why we think of viruses as deadly just because the ones we know about are deadly, and the others go unnoticed?"
15093,"Yes, very likely."
15094,Though a rise to 25% is rapid.
15095,So probably worse to come.
15096,"The Brits deserve all the recognition for this, well done vaccine management"
15097,It's not legal issues holding hospitals back from mandating the vaccine.
15098,It's practical considerations.
15099,Literally every nurse/doctor who's willing to move and doesn't have problems hanging over them is already employed.
15100,And already there aren't enough.
15101,The employees know this and aren't particularly loyal to their hospital/system.
15102,Then there's the public perception issue.

15111,As of yesterday there's still priority.
15112,It was recently expanded to most general health care workers but everyone else has to wait still.
15113,If the virus is in a place in their body where the immune system functions (i.e.
15114,bloodstream etc) it will be wiped out by the immune system.
15115,"The only way a vaccinated or otherwise immune person could spread it is if the virus is in a place in their body that the immune system can't reach such as stuck in mucous membranes in the nose or on the skin or something, and it would have to stay alive there until that person shed or spread it."
15116,"Or, you have enough of the virus for it to stay alive and be spread, but not enough for your immune system to respond."
15117,"This is all theoretically possible, but how likely?"
15118,I agree that we don't know but intuitively this just seems to be a far less likely scenario than the much more common case of someone getting it and getting infected and passing it along.

15126,We could in theory fire someone and not provide a reason.
15127,But if we just happened to cut a significant amount of staff and they all opted to not receive the vaccine it would be really easy to prove why they were fired.
15128,"And if they prove it was due to the vaccine, that is illegal and we would most likely be forced to shut down."
15129,"Not to mention, we simply cannot afford to fire 40% of our staff."
15130,We (just like every hospital) are extremely short staffed.
15131,We would have to close down even before they all sued us because we simply couldn't function

15147,But...
15148,I don't understand how this could be true.
15149,That lockdowns do not work.
15150,"I get that they are not preferable, but I'd still think they should ""work"" if people/businesses adhere to the principle of what a ""lockdown"" actually is?"
15151,"And if people/businesses are not adhering to those principles, doesn't it make a paper like this very flawed and miscalculated... even deceptive?"
15152,"I'm in a country that ""does OK"" with its Covid management."
15153,"Not perfect, but OK.  We have rolling levels of restrictions based primarily on how our hospital capacity is going, and have had a couple ""lockdowns"" that appear to have worked well at mitigating (not eliminating) it (right now we have at most double digit infections per day and only a death every few days/weeks... though I do expect New Years numbers to start showing themselves soon)."
15154,I have met up with friends twice since March because I just find visiting my parents to be more important than visiting friends and is helpful for keeping them safe.
15155,"I physically go to the food store usually once/month, occasionally twice/month since March."
15156,"I hang out with my parents and brother mostly on weekends or during the holidays (I consider them to be the only people in my ""bubble""), who live in a different home from myself, sometimes masked, sometimes not (depending on how it appears the virus is doing in the country at the moment) but always at a distance."
15157,Where I work we are indeed lucky to be spaced out enough that I don't feel compelled to complain that the guys in the office don't wear masks other than for entering and leaving the office or when conversations are being had anywhere closer than 8 feet apart.
15158,"I have shopped for furniture once, bin to the doctor once and took my cat to the Vet once and physically go to the pharmacy once/month (all masked/distanced), get takeout at a drivethrough a few times per month, but I think that has been all of the rest of the ""activities"" I have done since March."
15159,"Most of what I do is admittedly by my own choosing and not the government (though some is), but I consider what I do to be ""lockdown light"" (I see some people have been in total seclusion since March... that I believe to be too extreme for the situation in my country), and if everyone who is in what is considered to be a lockdown mixed with the general public to a similar degree as I do (maybe with a few more friend intermingling, outside, at a distance than I've had), how could even self-imposed ""lockdowns"" **not** work?"
15160,Seems illogical.
15161,"If you are around fewer people, you have less chance of infection."
15162,Right?
15163,In the US they were kinda forced to after conversations in other countries on this were so public-it had to be addressed with the public somehow.
15164,"so  75% of their cases was ""regular"" covid."
15165,which means their huge surge wasnt caused by this strain.
15166,"Oh cool, radical
  
Though, that's 3 days from 4 million, on 1/2 compared to the 2 days to hit 3 million, 12/31."
15167,Pace is stagnating a bit
15168,To say that you need to compare excess deathsbfor those years.
15169,It's not like during World War II people stopped dying of heart disease or cancer.
15170,"Jeez, stop pushing your agenda so hard."
15171,They got it ruff.
15172,I haven't seen a single argument for implementation of lockdowns without adequate support for the American people.
15173,"Give everyone what they need to be able to stay locked down safely and comfortably, and subsequently reduce the risk to those who are truly essential and unable to work remotely or safely."
15174,"The burden has been placed on small businesses and individuals, many of whom were barely making ends meet before the pandemic."
15175,The worst part is when you think about how the talking points mainly pose the lockdown versus healthy economy as if the two are mutually exclusive.
15176,It's not as if our economy is booming at the cost of hundreds of thousands of lives.
15177,Restaurants and bars are still struggling to keep the lights on - service workers are risking their lives for a fraction of their typical earnings - and no one has any other choice.
15178,"The government  could have prevented so much of this, and reduced the overall death count, but they didn't."
15179,A strict lockdown wouldn't mean losing your home if it were done properly.
15180,Unfortunately the vast majority of those in power within the US Government are largely unconcerned with the wellbeing of their constituents.
15181,"This is nothing new, but our experience with this public health crisis has made it clear."
15182,"I'm able to work from home for the majority of my job, and I do everything I can to reduce the risk when I'm required to be somewhere in person."
15183,"I am living in as much of a lockdown as possible - not just for my own safety, but for the millions and millions of Americans who are being forced to risk their lives to make ends meet because of the criminal negligence of so many of our elected officials."

15190,"Measles, Dtap, polio, and smallpox for example all hover around 90-100%, although as low as 80%."
15191,With so many millions of infections mixed with a low efficacy one could argue there is a better than normal chance for emergent immunity.
15192,High chance?
15193,Probably not but should be considered.
15194,Unlikely but not proven does NOT equate to apparently you can.

15202,A lot of it is simple hospital capacity.
15203,"Florida has more cases per capita, way more deaths per capita, and a lot less testing per capita than California does."
15204,Or maybe everyone is just dying before they can get to the hospital.

15225,"That's more than the combined deaths from Operation Iraqi Freedom (2003-2010) and Operation Enduring Freedom Freedom (2001-14), where the Defense Department (DoD) lists 6,756 total military deaths."
15226,Those numbers don't actually count all the Americans who died in the Iraq and Afghan wars.

15264,"Both Person B &amp; Person C have been in touch with someone who is infected, a week ago."
15265,"Today, they have been tested negative while Person A was tested positive."

15287,Not sure about why they wouldn‚Äôt do this.
15288,Military medics are not NAEMT certified and military doctors are usually not AMA certified ... in other words they can't treat civilians.
15289,Even military dependents and spouses are now usually treated by civilian doctors at off post hospitals and clinics.
15290,"The reason why vaccines take years or decades is the testing, certification, and beurocracy to be able to sell them."
15291,Multiple companies can (and are) making the vaccine fast.
15292,There would be no vaccine had the government not made emergency measures and had private companies cooperate with the government to allow fast certification.
15293,It is more important than funding.
15294,"Also, in regards to funding - the promise of governments to buy millions of doses **is the investment**."

15410,nut cases like this guy needs to be contained away from other ppl so he doesn't get anyone killed.
15411,"&gt; he 95%, from my understanding, is the result of the 8 vaccinated out of 170 positive cases (5%) showing that 5% is ineffective against the covid-positive group (95% effective)."
15412,This part is sort of correct but the emphasis is slightly on the wrong aspect.
15413,The placebo group got 162 infections and the vaccine group got 8 infections so it is likely the vaccine prevented 154 infections i.e.
15414,95% effective.
15415,"If the vaccine had to effect, you would expect very similar numbers of infected in the two groups."
15416,&gt; The problem here is that there‚Äôs no definitive proof that the vaccine is ever 95% effective because such a low sample size of positive tested ppl were used (170/32523 = 0.465%) to determine the efficacy of the vaccine.
15417,This is a question of the confidence on the estimate of 95% effectiveness.
15418,Basically there are few enough infected people that it is entirely possible the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are equally effective.
15419,"It doesn't directly matter how many people were in the trial though, it just matter how many got infected in either group."
15420,"&gt; If they included them, the effectiveness would be like 99% or so."
15421,"No, absolutely not."
15422,"By this logic, the vaccine is 100% effective at preventing getting mugged by a leprechaun because no one in the vaccine group got mugged by one."
15423,"What effectiveness actually measures is how much less likely something is based on receiving a vaccine- you are 95% less likely to get a symptomatic case of COVID-19 than someone in similar circumstances who did not receive the vaccine, not 99%."
15424,Thanks.
15425,That's the way I understood it too.
15426,And we all witnessed it too with a highly politicized incident earlier this year when a policeman killed a man and the ambulance had to take him to the hospital although he was fairly obviously unconscious and likely dead.

15434,"Not only are there more patients who take more time and more resources, but the embedded staff is getting sick, and there‚Äôs not much left in the travel staff or military deployments."

15437,"Basic drugs and treatments are in short supply, and while drug shortages are nothing new for hospitals, these latest shortages are not ones that ha e happened before."

15457,Well my point is that I am not sure it is a personnel problem.
15458,"If you double the number of people at hospitals but nobody goes to the hospitals, or the people at the hospitals refuse the vaccine, then you haven't gotten anywhere."
15459,"Not an immunologist, but my understanding is that the immune system will target lots of different proteins the virus produces, whereas the vaccine only recreates one."
15460,"So if the another strain of the virus changes that one protein, it can evade immunity created by the vaccine, but natural immunity still has lots of things it'll recognise."
15461,By analogy it's a little like the difference between meeting someone vs. having them described to you.

15631,"&gt;Evidence of in-flight transmission on a flight from the United Arab Emirates to New Zealand is strongly supported by the epidemiologic data, in-flight seating plan, symptom onset dates, and genomic data for this group of travelers who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (passengers A‚ÄìG)."
15632,"Among the 7 passengers, 2 (A and B) were probably index case-patients infected before the flight, 4 (C, D, E, and F) were probably infected during the flight, and the remaining passenger (G) was probably infected while in MIQ."
15633,All 7 passengers were seated in aisle seats within 2 rows of where the presumed index case-patient(s) were seated.
15634,"&gt;Combined, these data present a likely scenario of &gt;4 SARS-CoV-2 transmission events during a long-haul flight from Dubai to Auckland."
15635,These transmission events occurred despite reported in-flight use of masks and gloves.
15636,"Further transmission between travel companions then occurred after the flight, in an MIQ facility."
15637,"&gt;These conclusions are supported by genome sequencing, an in-flight seating plan, and dates of disease onset."
15638,"These data do not definitively exclude an alternative exposure event, such as virus transmission at the Dubai airport before boarding (e.g., during check-in or in boarding queues)."

15769,"With the amount of people estimated to‚Äôve already had it (actual cases not confirmed,) should that should hopefully give us a little boost in reaching herd immunity earlier than expected from vaccinating?"
15770,Or will the fact that they‚Äôll vaccinate those who already had it offset that and slow things down?
15771,"Also with mounting evidence that they may‚Äôve been wrong about some assumptions regarding asymptomatic versus pre-symptomatic, I wonder if actual cases is much closer to confirmed cases after all."

Reports: Los Angeles ambulance crews told not to transport patients with little survival chance
The number of coronavirus hospitalizations in L.A. County has surged 305% since Thanksgiving."
15832,Some emergency patients have to sit in ambulances for hours.
15833,"Author: TEGNA
Published: 9:38 PM PST January 4, 2021
Updated: 9:38 PM PST January 4, 2021


Los Angeles County hospitals are now so inundated with COVID-19 patients, ambulance crews are reportedly being instructed to conserve use of oxygen and not to transport patients that have little chance of survival."
15834,The Los Angeles Times obtained a memo by the L.A. County Emergency Medical Services Agency that was issued Monday.
15835,It states that ambulance crews should conserve oxygen by only giving it to patients who have oxygen saturation levels below 90%.
15836,That comes following a directive last week that ambulance crews should not transport patients to the hospital who have virtually no chance for survival.
15837,CNN reports crews are instructed to attempt resuscitation for at least 20 minutes until the patient is stabilized.
15838,"If a pulse is not restored or if the person is declared dead at the scene, they are not to be brought to the hospital."
15839,"The Times reports emergency rooms are so full, patients are waiting as long as eight hours inside ambulances before a bed opens up."
15840,"That means those ambulances can't respond to other emergency calls, including those not related to the coronavirus."
15841,"Los Angeles County Public Health data shows there were nearly 7,900 confirmed COVID-19 patients hospitalized as of Sunday, with 775 new patients admitted just on that day."
15842,Twenty-one percent of the total patients were in intensive care.
15843,The situation is only expected to get more dire in the coming weeks.
15844,County health officials say what they're dealing with now only represents the post-Thanksgiving surge.
15845,‚ÄúWe do not believe that we are yet seeing the cases that stemmed from the Christmas holiday.
15846,"This, sadly, and the cases from the recent New Year‚Äôs holiday, is still before us, and hospitals across the region are doing everything they can to prepare,"" L.A. County director of health services Dr. Christina Ghaly said at a Monday Briefing, the Times said."
15847,"County health data shows that there were 1,951 confirmed COVID-19 hospitalizations on Thanksgiving."
15848,It's increased 305% in the past six weeks.
15849,Could this be title word soup and a mis representation of the numbers?
15850,Sounds like the 2/3s of doses unused INCLUDES the SECOND dose that needs to be saved for the person who got their first shot.
15851,"As in, I wouldn‚Äôt expect it to get below ‚Äú1/2 the doses are going unused‚Äù"
15852,"This post appears to be about vaccines, please see [our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/wiki/faq#wiki_where_can_i_find_information_about_the_mechanism_and_progress_of_vaccines.3F) for answers to frequently asked questions regarding the COVID-19 vaccines."

15874,I agree.
15875,I don't know why they don't give the vaccine to the first 3 or 4 groups simultaneously.
15876,There is absolutely no evidence of any vaccine scarcity.
15877,Just allocate something like 50% of the doses to the top group and give the other 50% to anyone that you can.
15878,GODDAMNIT WHEN DO I GET MINE THEN???!!
15879,!

15882,"Yep, and this is what most hospitals have been doing since the pandemic started."
15883,That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been saying.
15884,Too much confusion about tiers.
15885,Just vaccinate people!
15886,"If you‚Äôve got vaccines, use them!"
15887,Well their police force is also literally less than 1/10th of the US.
15888,So maybe get your cops to do something other than shooting black folks in the back?
15889,"I am really curious how ""big"" a problem this is in percentage affected."
15890,"From the article....
""The analysis was limited to respondents with illnesses lasting longer than 28 days, whose onset of symptoms occurred before June 2020, allowing examination of symptoms over an average six months‚Äô duration."
15891,"Roughly 65% of respondents (2,454) reported experiencing symptoms for at least six months."
15892,"The most likely symptoms to persist after six months included fatigue, post-exertional malaise, cognitive dysfunction (‚Äúbrain fog‚Äù), neurological sensations, headaches, memory problems, insomnia, muscle aches, palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness/balance issues, and speech and language problems."""
15893,...
15894,This doesn't tell us what % of people that get sick end up as long haulers though.
15895,Only what percentage of people that had already had symptoms for 28+ days and participated in the study.
15896,"It's hard to say because the target protein of the vaccines is what keeps mutating and if the rate of mutation keeps up and stays so specific to the spike protein, for whatever reason, we may have a big problem."
15897,If the mutations weren't all on the protein we need to not change much so the vaccine keeps working than I would agree the probabilities should be very small.
15898,"The upside is that the mRNA vaccine and the vaccines made from de-activated virus particles should produce different immune responses, so we have some vaccine diversity that might help combat spike protein mutation."
15899,"2 months ago I would have agree, COVID19 seems stable enough to not worry about, but these variants found close to each other in time AND both mutating exactly where we don't want them to mutate is pretty concerning."
15900,"That‚Äôs why I decided to stay home for our company wide, in person, two day 2021 kick off meeting where no one is wearing masks."

15909,"People will despair, give up and stop following public health advice, making everything worse."
15910,We absolutely should be making informed predictions like this.
15911,"We know the vaccines are highly effective, and we roughly know how much we can produce."
15912,We've been jolted along at the whims of Dear Leader.
15913,"Every healthcare provider, from doctors to pharmacists to nurses, has the right to refuse to administer a medication, because it is also our license on the line if something happens."
15914,There are many medication errors and adverse events prevented because nurses and pharmacists aren‚Äôt just mindless pill dispensers.
15915,This is correct.
15916,"Emergency Medicine and EMS hasn't been doing this for about a decade in some places, this is LAC just catching up."
15917,Becaus hospitals can‚Äôt have half of their staff quitting lol
15918,"That's the problem we are currently facing, wtf do you do?"
15919,Seems like Sweden has reached a plateau?
15920,These numbers are pretty similar to last week aren't they?
15921,Or are these a lagging death report from a few weeks back?
15922,The problem is that we still don‚Äôt know what is the minimum NAb titer results in efficacy.
15923,"We already have a number of flu, RSV and other infectious disease that wok as a surrogate for success."
15924,"So without that, we are blind if we don‚Äôt have a clinical trial."
15925,The 25 ug titers were logs lower than the effective 100 ug dose and lower in comparison to titer from Pfizer‚Äôs 30 ug dose.

Your argument, that Donald Trump is responsible for any of it and that any other government would achieve that is laughable."
15931,Again - in your Country are dying twice as many people from this as in meine because of your incompetent response!
15932,Give the administration ‚Äûsome credit‚Äú for it - yeah... bravo!
15933,If this change had no impact of odds of survival they would have made that change much earlier.
15934,While slim chances it still means people dying who wouldn‚Äôt have otherwise.
15935,"It‚Äôs extraordinarily unlikely they will have a bad outcome if they‚Äôre healthy, exercise often and are not overweight"

15939,"It's the arrogance that comes from a sense of *divine righteousness* paired with the usual stupidity that means they never, ever learn from their actions or bother to question if they were wrong."
15940,"And crowds of people come to listen to these people ""preach"" for moral guidance lmao."
15941,I've given up trying to explain that a hospital with a high percentage of covid patients who are not cycling out of the hospital in a short period of time puts us all at risk.
15942,If the hospital is beyond capacity and someone has a major emergency the extra minutes or hours to transport them elsewhere can be the difference between life and death.
15943,Now I understand why my doctor just handed me pills to expel my miscarriage in a tiny manila envelope in her office.
15944,"I thought it was a little weird/sketchy at the time for a doctor to hand me medication, but after hearing your story, she was probably saving me the frustration and emotional trauma of dealing with a potentially shitty pharmacist and an interrogation."
15945,of course they should take it.
15946,But if employees can‚Äôt/won‚Äôt force them too and they‚Äôre not willing to take it what do you do?
15947,beg them?
15948,Probably not safer for the new variant that's way more infectious...these people are potentially fucked.
15949,"No way in hell I'd do that unless it was drive thru, and even so, I'd still be decked out head to toe in protective gear."
15950,"I know I‚Äôm late on this, but thanks for your work."

15954,[removed]
15955,6 weeks is what BioNtech says they need to adjust their vaccine if/when this happens.
15956,Doesn't sound like much when there are 52 weeks in a year but that's 6 weeks of deaths.
15957,Then there's the logistics of rolling out the updated vaccine and you see how we are doing so far when it comes to logistics.
15958,"80,000 excess deaths compared to the 28,000 officially attributed to COVID."
15959,"Wow, that magnitude and discrepancy of excess death is on a level as bad as Peru's, Ecuador's, or Mexico's (0.2% to 0.25% of total population died)"
15960,"Also, chin diapers (from south park)"
15961,Hahahahaha!

15963,We need legal euthanization.

15966,sounds scary
15967,You really think people are going to leave en mass in the middle of a pandemic and a recession when the other option is literally just get your shot?
15968,Idk...maybe we don't need those people in nursing.
15969,"I know that's reductionist and understaffing is a problem, but the problem is largely a product of coronavirus spreading unimpeded."

15984,"In addition to increased flu vaccination rates, our draconian restrictions and mask wearing are working too damm well."
15985,Who would have thought that draconian restrictions would work better than the annual flu vaccine.
15986,"With regards to Covid, we may not be able to replace these ‚Äúeffective‚Äù draconian restrictions with mass vaccinations."
15987,The sad possible reality is that vaccinations will complement but not replace current restrictions when it comes to curbing Covid cases/deaths.
15988,When was the last time our government was able to do anything right?
15989,It's almost like they're trying to kill us all.
15990,Sometimes it even goes deeper than that.
15991,"For example, the CIA was heavily involved in the production of Zero Dark Thirty and helped shape the script to show them in a more favorable light:

15994,"This is true but also worth mentioning the act of vaccination in of itself creates positive pressure for escape mutations , so too does vaccinating more slowly during an intense period of spread."
15995,"If this was something we should tear our hair out about we would not vaccinate at all ,and if we did, we would wait until we have doses available to vaccinate a huge mass of people , (which would of course be absurd given the context) the a risk/reward model tells us it's probably better to avoid tens of thousands of short-medium term deaths."
15996,"Further, there's comprehensive body of evidence to suggest longer interval during a prime boost regimen results in higher immunogecity/more durable protection."
15997,Meaning for the hypothetical amplified risk of escape variant selection during the maximum 3-12 weeks post-dose one administration potentially vs the old approach (21 days later) there has been offset 'risk in the distance' .
15998,This is something many do not mention .
15999,"Also worth highlighting that FDA/AICP usually sets a 4 week minimum delay during dose interval..vaccinate too early and you've at best reduced the impact (pfizer second doses administered &lt;19 days from first are advised to be ignored and not treated as a second dose )

the reason 21 days is done with pfizer is they were under time constraints of the trial so never investigated longer."
16000,"It's more than likely 21 days does not represent the optimal prime boost interval, rather the minimum dose interval which has been proven (as we understand from almost every other vaccine ever conceived)

 Every covid vaccine trial that bothered to attempt to investigate optimal dose schedule found longer than 21 days was superior (which correlates with our understanding of immunology) E.G Cansino found 21 days was not superior vs when it tested longer, AZ found 21 days was not superior vs when it tested longer (12 weeks) J-j tested 4 weeks vs 8 weeks and 8 weeks was substantially better.. etc."
16001,There's no reason to beleive pfizer vacc will be different based on foundational knowledge of immunology.
16002,Just nobody has bothered researching this yet sadly.
16003,"In a few months hopefully we'll have the concrete data to demonstrate

My prediction: we will see the 'off label' interval is at worst is no worse than 21 days and at best offers superior protection, and will be validated to have saved thousands of lives vs the alternative ( the classic trolley problem  context in which it was greenlighted in UK)"
16004,"I asked my GMa why so many, and she shrugged tiredly and said, ""There was no way to prevent them."""

16019,I voice some unhappiness with putting up with restrictions for almost a year and I get shamed.
16020,My step daughter  constantly kept me sick or brought home lice... public school funding needs to advance by billions.
16021,A big part of the reason it is taking so long to distribute (in addition to just general incompetence) is that they are adhering too rigidly to the schedule of who should get vaccinated.
16022,"For example Cuomo imposed a million dollar fine for hospitals which deviate from the schedule (e.g., by vaccinating an elderly person before a healthcare worker), even if the vaccines would go to waste otherwise."
16023,"&gt;Encouragements to the citizens, audio messages to avoid overcrowding, even the imposition of fines, however, where persuasions and advice do not take place, are provided

Basically, Greece is in a 1 week total lockdown before the opening of schools next week."
16024,The Orthodox Church 'Epiphany' celebration takes place on Wednesday of this week and the church has refused to close to worshippers.
16025,"The government has backed down and will now instead of forcing closure, place police outside to request that people socially distance during worship."
16026,It should be noted that the government has already conceded that earlier outbreaks in Greece's second largest city were a result of the opening of churches during lockdown.
16027,Man fuck off with your bullshit.
16028,"I hope people wise up and less sign up for the military, however we create a permanent underclass that are forced into it, and I don't hold it against a young naive person for joining because they don't have other options."
16029,"&gt;Over a hundred thousands civilians and several tens of thousands of Iraqi and Afghan combatants have also died, and continue to die."
16030,"They don't matter, silly, now let's go pardon some more war criminals"
16031,"A couple of the mutations we‚Äôre seeing may somewhat reduce the efficacy of current vaccines (the South African strain, for example), but likely not by an amount that would render the vaccinations useless."
16032,"Likewise, there‚Äôs evidence that the antibodies provided by prior infection or vaccination mature or adapt over time to dampen the impact of these mutations (also keep in mind antibodies are only one part of immunity)."
16033,It‚Äôs good news.
16034,I'm so glad I asked for a work transfer when I did.
16035,I was surrounded by these morons at work.
16036,It was beyond vexing
16037,"That doesn‚Äôt mean that‚Äôs the real number, just the best information we have at the time."
16038,Maybe the person in Colorado that published the numbers has been busy and hasn‚Äôt gotten around to it.
16039,"Or is still on vacation, for instance."
16040,"Maybe in Pennsylvania they are only getting information from some healthcare facilities, but not many at the moment."
16041,I‚Äôve been F5ing a lot but you can‚Äôt take sub-day information to heart.
16042,Best is to look week to week to get a better idea of what‚Äôs going on.
16043,Nah after the 2nd shot I plan to let the guard down a bit.
16044,I feel it's important to get back to normal.
16045,I'm getting one tomorrow!
16046,As an employee of Northwell Health.
16047,"Definitely not front line, but in contact with med students, physicians, etc."
16048,"Feel a little weird about going so early, even though I'm somewhat immunocompromised."
16049,I'm younger.
16050,"But knowing that there's a lot going unused kinda makes me say fuck it, just *get it out there."
16051,"*

One big complaint was that I was eligible to schedule an appointment yesterday and had no idea because *I never got notified."
16052,"* Had to be told to go and check, which is a big failure, I think."
16053,"Obviously not every hospital system has that problem, but it's definitely a flaw."
16054,Actually that would be the line the virus (hacker) would use.
16055,The vaccine (IT) would come in saying ‚Äúsomeone gave unauthorized access to our hardware and they planted a virus‚Äù.
16056,"Until further notice we are now taking control to run an anti virus and all work will redirected to this aim, unless all of you want to find new jobs."
16057,The worldwide peak of death caused by the 1968-1969 H3N2 pandemic flu happened in January 1969 and Woodstock happened in August 1969.
16058,"Also, the H3N2 vaccine was generated in four months into the pandemic by the great Maurice Hilleman, so the flu vaccine was available and deployed before Woodstock happened."
16059,We are always better prepared for pandemic influenza strains since we know so much about it.
16060,Something that is more novel with no protection is more deadly than something that is well known with a layer of protection.
16061,A study of the uk variant proposed this process as a reason the variant had so many more mutations than other variants.
16062,"If they are going down this road, they might as well bypass EMA and approve the AstraZeneca-Oxford University vaccine already."
16063,At least that approach would rest on scientific data.
16064,Hah!
16065,"Lucky you, in France about 99.9% of Covid-19 vaccines are unused right now (and no, that's not an exaggeration, we have about a half-million in stock, and used about five hundreds of these)."
16066,"Yeah kids are super spreaders of every single virus except Covid......haha, government officials apparently have never raised a child in public school."
16067,Thanks for this history lesson.
16068,"&gt;	Mellan den 1 januari och den 30 november i √•r dog 87 511 personer i Sverige, enligt den prelimin√§ra statistiken."

16070,"So, between January 1 and November 30 there was excess mortality of 4859 deaths, compared to the average of the year 2015‚Äì2019."
16071,That‚Äôs far fewer than the official covid death toll that currently sit at 8985 and was in the neighbourhood of 7800 on November 30.

16076,its similair to fall of france.. quick victory unlikely... but if everything lined up.. complete victory...
16077,"I always wondered if France just attacked when Germany attacked Poland and just tuck the Ruhr.... 

it was just so much unlikely stuff lining up..."
16078,Idk why articles still talking about this a long time ago it was said it's fine cause Quran allows it if life saving
16079,"check bitcoin price....

nah"
16080,The flu deaths are exaggerated.
16081,"A bunch of physicians started wondering about why it is they see other causes of death so much more often then flu, despite the number of flu deaths supposedly being greater."
16082,"For example: the oft-cited range of 40k-60k flu deaths in a year, if accurate, means that fewer people die of gunshot wounds or car wrecks or opioid overdoses."
16083,And yet the physicians do not see this on a day-to-day basis.
16084,"They see opioid deaths, gunshot deaths and car accident deaths far, far more frequently than they see flu deaths."
16085,But the numbers say they shouldn't.
16086,Turns out the answer is the 40k - 60k number is a joke and shouldn't be taken seriously.
16087,"The real number is 3,448 - 15,620."

16097,all cost money.
16098,"In case you haven't noticed, all states are currently undergoing budget issues due to economic slowdowns and increased reliance on social programs like unemployment."
16099,"While the Moderna vaccine is a bit more tolerant, the Pfizer one has extreme transport and storage requirements that make distribution and storage even more costly."
16100,"Tell me, how are states supposed to pay for all this when they are already hemorrhaging money from secondary effects of the pandemic?"
16101,Zero federal assistance severely hampers states' abilities to distribute resources.
16102,Having 50 different distribution methods and conditions is madness when you should only have one.
16103,This again is compounding that many states have underfunded their health systems for years.
16104,"It makes sense for you to collect information in one place, not fifty different ones."
16105,"When the vaccine was getting close, the federal government should have been working with states to collect information about how many doses each state needed and where for each tier level."
16106,"At the same time, they should have been giving money to states to prepare the infrastructure to distribute vaccines once they had them."
16107,"Money that could have went towards preparing vaccination sites, public information campaigns for the who, what, where, and why, database prep for tracking who gets it, where, and when, etc."
16108,"We had the federal government doing the equivalence of dropping a shipping crate worth of mail with no addresses on states' doorsteps and telling them, ""Did my part."
16109,You just need to figure out where and who these are all going to.

16123,Just wondering with the incubation period being 5/6 days for the majority of cases.
16124,Say for example someone was exposed on Monday then gets tested 2 days later does that there's a chance that it's a false negative and they could still test positive a few days later?
16125,Hope and Glory is quite good
16126,Neil Ferguson (the guy responsible for the Imperial College model which often over predicts deaths) said that lockdowns were unthinkable in the west until China set the precedent for them.

16128,The fact the U.S. has the physical vaccine but are so unprepared to actually distribute it is absolutely infuriating.
16129,"This is the result of ""leaving it up to the states""."
16130,It's been a fucking year of this shit and they couldn't have come up with plans on a better roll out?
16131,I know it's a fantasy but I wish we could just do the drive thru mass vaccine clinics like my city does with flu vaccine.
16132,The fact the we have the doses but not the means to distribute them is crazy making.

16134,You are an extreme outlier
16135,Don't you remember how half the country denied the Civil War was a thing until we hit the magic number of 400K dead?

16155,Every 5 minutes wasted verifying someone‚Äôs profession or health risk category is a vaccine not given out.
16156,The only easy and fast way to prioritize is by age since that is easily done by birth date.
16157,Most frontline healthcare workers have been vaccinated.
16158,Start with everyone 65+ and just open that shit up and jab as many as you can until supplies run out.

16248,I know you guys managed to keep deaths low back in the October surge of cases but if hospitalisations are now rising rapidly then deaths may start to rise again unfortunately.
16249,partial reason why younger generation tend to have fewer babies is because of the rise in living costs.
16250,"my grandma for instance has 11 kids, down to my father having 4.

another reason is because we are getting lazy at raising gremlins."

16252,"At the institute is decided if the body is being examined - which is generally the case when the cause of death is deemed ""non-natural""."

16359,"Plus, if employees don't want it, they are sitting on those doses for them rather than getting them out."

16421,"IPV (polio vaccine used in US) doesn't prevent transmission of polio, for example."
16422,"Flu vaccinated populations rarely transmit, but it has been documented to occur."
16423,The major issue here is that we have no evidence (none; it simply wasn't tested) the vaccine prevents asymptomatic infection and we know this virus can spread asymptomatically.
16424,It's not useful to use an example of a vaccine that stops symptoms of a virus and thereby reduces transmission to a vaccine that does not stop symptoms of a virus that spreads asymptomatically.
16425,"If you had a 1% chance of dying, you would not go to work."

16581,"Most vaccines work better with a longer than 3 week gap between doses, there's a good chance the Pfizer one does too."
16582,Yes it's a risk because the data isn't there but it's not as completely reckless as you present it to be given that it will give many more people some protection  in the short term which might be enough to save their lives.

16881,Just to be clear I am against not giving the second dose at all (though it doesn't actually look like this is what Canada is doing).
16882,I also don't think I would make the call to do Pfizer for 12 weeks but I can see the public health merits.
16883,"6 seems totally fine for the countries choosing to do that, especially given new data showing the Pfizer vaccine is 90% effective before the second dose (after the first 2 weeks), and that's for symptoms, hugely unlikely you'd have to go to hospital after a single shot."
16884,"Anyway, looks like US made a call you are happier with so"
16885,their cases are certainly rising
16886,"When did they start testing the strain, and how much of that nature of testing are they doing?"
16887,"There's been a pretty significant spike in Georgia, which has been wide, WIDE open this whole time - parties, crowded clubs, concerts, etc."

16944,I have to believe this variant is behind most of the surges we are seeing bow
16945,"&gt; so the efficacy between dose 1 and dose 2 is 52 percent

The overall efficacy for the first 21 days is unimportant to the discussion, because it has been assessed that the first dose of the vaccine only starts being effective 12 days after the first dose."
16946,How fucking hard is it for you to understand?
16947,"For the purpose of this discussion, the only thing that matters is the level of efficacy reached by the first dose around when the second dose is administered, and trial data clearly shows that it's around 90%, based on 92.3% in the 7 days before day 21, and 90.5% in the 7 days after day 21."

16954,your promises are worthless
16955,"But some of them wear masks or social distance when they don't follow their own restrictions, so it's fine."
16956,"The lists is there because this vaccine is complicated as you need two doses, if you just mass distribute it you may run into situation where you have to give people their second dose before others get their first one, so it has to have priority list"
16957,"We were successful for quite a while, but after 9 months of this people seem to have become fatigued by the whole thing and it's easy to see it all falling apart."

16962,Comparing the level of tragedy of that with what is a vast majority of old people who have already lived their lives and are at the end of their life is just ridiculous.
16963,There is a reason why a news story about a tragic or violent death of a young parent makes more news and causes more reaction than when a 90 year old person dies in bed in a nursing home.

16977,"They were hoarding vaccines in a crappy freezer, where the safeguard alarm failed...and now they want to be seen as a hero because they were forced to actually vaccinate folks."
16978,Oh boy.
16979,"Even if it is safe, which I‚Äôm not convinced it is given how the virus may adapt to a weak vaccine, I promise you, watering down the vaccines will torpedo the long-term fight against Covid in America because a lot of people won‚Äôt show up for a ‚Äúmaybe it will help you‚Äù vaccine."
16980,"The people who aren‚Äôt afraid of covid are already running around like nothing is going on, and the people who are still being cautious will have no confidence in the vaccine because it doesn‚Äôt change anything in their lives."

16988,Seems like this has already happened
16989,&gt; I'm sure a lot of doctors just want to address straightforward problems.
16990,Yes.
16991,I found that out after seeing a doctor get angry when the treatments she was throwing at my insomnia (which got resolved later via other means) actually made it worse.
16992,Doctors don't like it when they can't fix your stuff.
16993,Super soft.

16998,As a New Yorker living in western pa this year‚Äôs 9/11 was really an angry day for me.
16999,It was 11 years since the attack where 3000 New Yorkers died and 11 WEEKS since more than double that died in one seven day period (some of which were buried in unmarked graves).
17000,And virtually every one of my conservative friend‚Äôs profiles was filled with ‚Äúnever forget‚Äù blah blah blah.
17001,Meanwhile they were going hard core on the notion that Covid wasn‚Äôt really killing people like they said it was the week before they posted their sentimental patriotic BS.

17066,"I remember in the very early days at the time when South Korea had done 130,000 tests the US had done 500."
17067,Total.
17068,There were warning signs of what was to come even then.
17069,The worst thing that could have happened is for the US to be hit by a pandemic when T*ump was president in an election year.
17070,"The US is one of the richest countries and could have set up sufficient financial aid to encourage people to do the right thing and, along with consistent messaging, things would be very different right now."
17071,In Victoria for example people were able to get financial assistance in order to stay home if they needed to get tested or needed to quarantine or care for someone with Covid if it was needed.
17072,That‚Äôs alongside the other federal assistance for individuals and businesses.
17073,"The US is happy to print money to keep the stock market afloat by allowing the Fed to buy up big on corporate bonds, etc but if a family has hungry kids at home and not only their income but their health care is at risk then there won‚Äôt be sufficient buy-in for locking down - and you can‚Äôt blame them."
17074,It would be near impossible for the US to get to the same position as NZ or Australia or other similar countries now.
17075,The best would be to have sufficient financial assistance for people to encourage them to stay at home for a period of time to get cases under control so hospitals get some relief and the vaccinations can be ramped up.
17076,The big issue is the financial assistance - can‚Äôt see it happening.

17223,And when we look at the available data it still stands that the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine has an efficacy of only 70 % compared to approx.
17224,95 % for Biontech/Pfizer and Moderna.
17225,(So somebody vaccinated with Oxford/AstraZeneca has 6 times the risk of getting Covid-19 as somebody vaccinated with Biontech/Pfizer or Moderna).
17226,The CEO of AstraZeneca stated a belief that at some point they will publish an efficacy that is up there with everybody else.
17227,As long as that belief has not turned into a reality I would prefer Biontech/Pfizer and Moderna over Oxford/AstraZeneca if I had the choice.
17228,"If rumours are to be believed, it was only Macron/France that pushed for and got the Sanofi deal, with the EU having an order of 300M doses from them vs 100M from BioNTech."

17241,"https://connect.uclahealth.org/2020/09/21/covid-19-affects-sense-of-smell-differently-than-colds-flu/

Anosmia in the flu or cold is mainly caused by congestion."
17242,It's partial and short lived.
17243,COVID-19 causes a more acute and sometimes lengthy loss of smell without congestion.
17244,Dr. Griffin is a great source of info.

17250,"I had something nasty in February, tested negative for flu."
17251,Too early to get tested for COVID in the USA.

17263,What's normal about having to wear a mask basically everywhere you go in public?
17264,It's almost as if some people feel like they can will normalcy into being if they just repeatedly insist that things are actually pretty normal despite visible and overwhelming evidence to the contrary the moment you walk out your front door.

17288,good work NZ
17289,And lab research has cured cancer a zillion times.
17290,Yawn.
17291,Let me know when this Covid drug passes Phase 3 trials.
17292,Germany's current rules are nowhere close to NZ's past rules.
17293,That is not correct.
17294,It was about 3 months in the worst state.
17295,Increase in numbers are exponential and so is the decrease.
17296,"If everyone stayed home and met no one outside of the household for 3 weeks, the number of cases would be close to zero."
17297,In practise this is not possible and indeed a higher and wider spread increases the necessary time.
17298,"Looking at the us today, if they did the same lockdown as the state in aus they would probably need 3 months as well."
17299,Now you can argue that the same level of lockdown can not be achieved because of reasons but that is another point.
17300,If the us wanted to life a normal life (but inckuding border restrictions) they could do this in 3-4 months especially with efficient vaccination of the population.
17301,Incompetent
17302,My bet is fall or even into winter BUT the second the vaccine speeds up that will shorten the length of time until normal.
17303,It all hinges on speed of vaccine administration.
17304,I'm just praying this new variant isn't a wrench in the works somehow.
17305,"Uh, my critical care APRN wife would disagree."
17306,"Though in some places there may be a disproportionate number of elderly COVID patients clogging the hospitals, critical care beds are used by all ages and for a multitude of reasons."

17309,[removed]
17310,There is more to this.
17311,I have a 2 doctor friends that are not 100% convinced the vaccine is risk free due to some of the reactions.
17312,One even went as far as suggesting they will delay getting the vaccine until more stats are available (this isn't unreasonable since we live in a relatively safe country for COVID).
17313,They only mention this in conversation amongst friends and don't say it with conviction and certainty.
17314,"However, they would never mention this idea to a patient at work or take some sort of action to prevent them from getting vaccinated and go against all the current evidence."
17315,There is a leap from thinking something might be true to taking a big risk like this pharmacist did.
17316,&gt; France has only vaccinated 516 people.
17317,This issue is France and Germany wanted to get their vaccine from Sanofi.
17318,(France Company) But their Vaccine is kinda stuck as Phase 2 trials.
17319,So when they wanted to order Pfizer/Biontechs they were last in line.
17320,So yeah the whole EU bet on the wrong horse.
17321,When do they plan on ending the mass poverty and homelessness?
17322,"POTUS is mentally ill, and yet he has many followers and repeats conspiracy theories constantly  - so yes, more than probable."

17343,I mean at least he changed his mind?
17344,Is that the silver lining here?
17345,I cannot tell you how many hospital nurses/doctor stories I read daily that say people are still screaming it‚Äôs a hoax as they are being put on a ventilator.
17346,I mean there are people in ICU right now who think they are being lied to on why they are sick.
17347,There are people who were hospitalized and survived just like this women who still don‚Äôt believe the reason was COVID.
17348,This guy could of tripled down and still denied the COVID diagnosis.
17349,"I do seriously doubt either of them will socially distance (religious nut jobs never seem to, funny how that works) or wear masks now that they‚Äôve been infected and survived."
17350,But I guess we should all golf clap for their ability to believe the virus exists?
17351,Larry nine lives!
17352,!
17353,Because they're slow walking a vaccine in the midst of a pandemic as a new strain starts traveling the country.
17354,Why WOULDN'T you have a thing against Healthcare workers?
17355,Their negligence will kill more people than police have killed in the last century.
17356,Think about that.
17357,Healthcare workers have performed EXTREMELY poorly.
17358,And a lot of that comes directly from them taking vacations as people die.
17359,"Yes, the hills are alive with the sound of rona!"
17360,"&gt; for an entire year

Well, if you lock down, it wouldn't BE an entire year, would it?"
17361,It's not like those doses that workers are refusing are getting tossed in the trash.
17362,The more people that refuse means the sooner they will become available to the general populace.
17363,So you are being pushed ahead in line with every one of their refusals.
17364,But that's not what they got into the job for!
17365,I don't know why you're getting downvoted.
17366,Of course the regime will safeguard more for themselves than anyone else.

17370,"I admit, Im confused how you can't grasp these facts."
17371,"Say it together with me: ""flatten the curve""."
17372,The curve will be flat long before we hit herd immunity.

17375,The US won‚Äôt be happy about this.
17376,We gonna have to pump our numbers up
17377,They had a minuscule number of cases and very few deaths from late Spring until early fall while the US had a summer surge.
17378,Then people got complacent and Covid came roaring back.
17379,This is misinformation.
17380,Dr. Anthony Fauci said there‚Äôs no data supporting half doses on TV this morning.
17381,I will take our nation‚Äôs top infectious disease expert‚Äôs word over that of a redditor or whatever article you read on the blaze or britebart or whatever.

17792,Of course it's embarrassing.
17793,The entire USA response to this has been embarrassing.
17794,The idea that this was going to be any different is a great majestic unicorn.
17795,"Again, testing for antibodies is easy."
17796,Testing for actual immunity is harder.
17797,"We take for granted that ""antibodies"" and ""immunity"" are the same, right?"
17798,Except we have clear argument from the CDC that antibodies **are not the same** as immunity.
17799,You might even ask why would an actual infection *not* be better than an artificially induced immune response.
17800,The real answer is we're not sure.
17801,"Some diseases are actually better resisted once acquired than if vaccinated, and some are better resisted with a vaccine than with a previous infection."
17802,Getting the mumps grants you basically lifelong immunity to the pathogen.
17803,On the other hand vaccines for pneumococcal bacteria are superior to actually having had the pathogen.
17804,There's a wide variety of responses too.
17805,"Having a very high antibody load is positively correlated to a strong, and long, immunity to COVID-19 reinfection."
17806,"On the other hand if you had a very mild (or symptomless) infection, and therefore very small antibody responses, you might not be immune for very long."
17807,A basic antibody test will only tell you that both people have them.
17808,Not to what extent and for how long they're safe.
17809,"We need deeper tests for that, and that's not something we're fully equipped to do right now."
17810,Both.
17811,"Yes but only for thee, not for me."
17812,Bad diets and obesity is a symptom of wealth and a plant based poverty diet is healthier so it is targeting the wrong people.
17813,Who said that?

17815,I don‚Äôt remember it happening like that.
17816,Lesser offence or not
17817,"Also, ICU‚Äôs in LA were at 100% capacity days before he got in."
17818,Somehow he got a spot.
17819,Lucky sob.
17820,his internal model of orbital physics must be quite the tale
17821,More people need to see the science around this side of it when governments of the world haven't paid much attention on giving people advice to improve their metabolic health.
17822,So many people resort to bad eating habits for comfort which just makes us more at risk.
17823,I think we missed a huge opportunity to save more lives if we had paid as much attention to helping people improve their metabolic health as we did to mask wearing and everything else.
17824,Instead we have a bunch of new flavours of Doritos and Coca-Cola!
17825,haha
17826,We aren't hitting 500k a day on average.
17827,"Sure we hit that for the last three days of the week, but that's not necessarily predictive of this week."
17828,And also that would require us actually vaccinating people on weekends which is not happening at all right now
17829,Sociopathic paranoia trumps actual facts.
17830,The average age of COVID death is 79.
17831,80% of COVID deaths are amongst senior citizens.
17832,How much is that group really contributing to the economy?
17833,Not much.
17834,So we're going to ruin the lives of billions of people in order to give someone's Grandpa 6 more months of life before one of his other co-morbidities kills him.
17835,"COVID-man, COVID-man, does whatever a virus can."
17836,"I think you underestimate how expensive that would be, we already spent more per capita than any other developed country last year."
17837,It took Victoria 15 weeks to go from 700 cases a day to 0.
17838,2 - 3 months is not in the cards for the US.
17839,"Being apprehensive about the vaccine isn't crazy, they were developed in record time and people are understandably concerned."
17840,IIRC children and pregnant women are not being vaccinated for now because of these concerns.
17841,Believing the pandemic is a hoax and that Bill Gates wants to implant you with microchip via the vaccine - now that's crazy/moronic.
17842,And destroying vaccines meant for consenting people who needs them (high risk) - that's evil.
17843,So we lockdown for an arbitrary period of time and then open up and keep going until what infinity?
17844,I'm trying to see your logic but failing to do so.
17845,Will you be paying the bills of all the people who have lost work and can't feed their families?
17846,Can you get the people who have killed themselves in grief and despair back?
17847,Cases do not equal deaths.
17848,So please stay in your house forever and let some of us who aren't afraid of a virus with a 99% a survival rate get back to work and life.
17849,Look at hospitalizations in the US.
17850,Things are bad.
17851,[deleted]
17852,You realize it's not just administering shots right?
17853,At my hospital you have to be monitored for 15 minutes to make sure you don't have any allergic reactions.
17854,Trained medical professionals who can monitor patients for anaphylactic reactions and treat them don't just pop out of nowhere.
17855,Especially when the healthcare system is already taxed.
17856,How is he licensed...
17857,Not that bad yet alas

17861,They were never anything other than the people who were going to make the decision if the data was there.
17862,I have no beef with that.
17863,Zero.
17864,And making out like I‚Äôm anti science?
17865,I‚Äôm not.
17866,Slaoui made the statement.
17867,Not me.
17868,He alluded to being in possession of solid data.
17869,Not me.
17870,All I did was point out that the beginnings of data he MAY be working from is out in the public domain.
17871,Some commenter said zero 50 mcg testing had been done and that‚Äôs just not true.
17872,We already know of a little that was done.
17873,Is there more?
17874,He sure made it sound that way.
17875,There are still months before that age group is going to be up for vaccination.
17876,If it‚Äôs possible to get more doses out a vial then they have between now and then to satisfy the FDA.
17877,If it‚Äôs possible they‚Äôll pursue it.
17878,If it‚Äôs workable it would get a lot more people immunized.
17879,But the key word is IF.
17880,The trials are done for a reason.
17881,Don‚Äôt make out like I‚Äôm advocating for shortcuts.
17882,I had the same thought!
17883,"Must be conditioned because it sounds like ""removed from life support"" which has a completely different implication :X"
17884,I've met a lot of nurses who believe stuff like this too.
17885,Technically you can go RNA to DNA.
17886,That how RNA viruses insert their genomes into us.
17887,That how HIV changes the DNA of our immune cells.
17888,The RNA is converted to cDNA then to dsDNA then gets integrated in our DNA.
17889,This is likely not the case with modernas RNA vaccine
17890,The mechanism of action against parasites might be different than the antiviral effect.
17891,"The NIH writeup says about the antiviral effect:

&gt; Ivermectin acts by inhibiting the host importin alpha/beta-1 nuclear transport proteins, which are part of a key intracellular transport process that viruses hijack to enhance infection by suppressing the host antiviral response."
17892,"Ivermectin is therefore a host-directed agent, which is likely the basis for its broad-spectrum activity in vitro against the viruses that cause dengue, Zika, HIV, and yellow fever."
17893,"If I understand that correctly, the active ingredient needs to make it into the cells which the virus is trying to infect."
17894,"It would not ""kill"" the virus in air that's being filtered through a mask."
17895,It needs to be circulating in your blood plasma.
17896,"Here is the bit about dosage:

&gt; Ivermectin has been shown to inhibit the replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in cell cultures."
17897,"However, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies suggest that achieving the plasma concentrations necessary for the antiviral efficacy detected in vitro would require administration of doses up to 100-fold higher than those approved for use in humans."
17898,"For any drug, the delivery method (pills, shots, inhalers, topical creams, etc) needs to be chosen so that the active ingredient gets to the right place in the right amount."
17899,The best delivery method for each drug can depend on things like how well your body is able to take up the active ingredient.
17900,"(For example, some doctors prefer to prescribe topical cream for low-dose progesterone rather than pills because progesterone has better bioavailability through the skin than the stomach.)"
17901,"So if you're thinking about a mask dip... would that be delivering the drug topically to the skin, or having some of it inhaled in the air that goes through the mask, or both?"
17902,Would that be a high enough dose to actually do anything?
17903,(Would that be so high that you get really bad side effects?)
17904,Would it be a well-controlled amount?
17905,"Although I do not work in the pharmaceutical field, this just doesn't seem like a good idea to me."
17906,"If we want to give people Ivermectin, there are other proven ways to do it."
17907,Oh no!
17908,Kids will learn their verbs and multiplication tables a year later HOW EVER WILL THEY MANAGE??
17909,?
17910,basic law doesn‚Äôt allow for that they had to go to the npc.
17911,If you don‚Äôt see a problem with postponing an election without consulting the medical advisors you must have your head up your ass.

17913,3 weeks.

17928,Incredibly disgusting considering how many homeless people suffer from mental illness.

17930,Fuck this preacher.
17931,Have we had two so far?
17932,"There was this guy, and there was a nurse who said she did the same thing on purpose."
17933,Have there been any more?
17934,Not even the hospital workers want this thing.
17935,There‚Äôs a surplus.
17936,The rich aren‚Äôt taking shit
17937,"Sounds like the 'congregating with friends' is the problem, not the 'ordering takeaway drinks.'"
17938,"Moderna is 28 days between doses and then 14 days after the second dose is when immunity starts, so 42 days.so if you vaccinated a fuck load of people *today* then yeah, but mid February just isn‚Äôt enough time."
17939,Hopefully it will at least make a dent by then
17940,Lucky!
17941,I‚Äôd say there is a direct correlation between being a frontline healthcare worker and not taking it seriously.
17942,Watch enough people die and it becomes ‚Äújust another day in the life‚Äù.
17943,"One thing that the last 4 years have taught me is that it isn't the religion, it's the people."
17944,"If not religion, it will be the cult of Trump or something else."
17945,It's just that a certain percentage of people are like this.
17946,"It's difficult to understand, but a sizeable percentage of people are like this."
17947,"It was at a hospital, not a gathering... well a gathering, but not an enjoyable one."
17948,From your mouth to god's ears.
17949,"Signed, someone in Florida."
17950,Yeah but this is more like paleontologists not believing in evolution.
17951,"I'm an international student, and i travelled to the uk in sept for university."
17952,I had to fill out a form (which no one at the airport checked) and self isolate for 14 days.
17953,During which no one checked me.
17954,These are all valid tactics to curb the virus but nobody is enforcing them.

17973,I have been keeping track of the covid vaccine in my local city/state.
17974,"I strongly believe medical professional are both stealing and hoarding the vaccine for themselves, their families, and friends."
17975,My city has gotten thousands of dosages.
17976,But this city doesn't have thousands of healthcare workers.
17977,"Even if each of the hospitals has 500 people, it doesn't make sense that 10000 dosages can't cover these people."
17978,I'm not mentioning any name because I don't have concrete evidence.
17979,It's unlikely that anyone would.

17983,Did that take everyone's masks off?
17984,There's no way just blowing a fan around is going to infect that many people from a single person if those people were wearing masks.
17985,Something else must have happened besides just that.
17986,Lol thanks!
17987,Yeah I was relieved to see the FDA affirm the importance of sticking to evidence-based policy.
17988,"I was looking into how they did so much better (aside from being smaller and denser) and found this: https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/israel-vaccinates-the-most-people/2021/01/04/23b20882-4e73-11eb-a1f5-fdaf28cfca90_story.html

&gt; Israel‚Äôs vaccine success is made possible by its small size (slighter larger than New Jersey) and the efficiencies of its nationalized health system, in which all 9 million citizens hold identity cards and register their electronic medical files with one of the country‚Äôs four national health maintenance organizations (HMOs)."
17989,"&gt;
&gt; Israel also maintains a national vaccination registry, first designed for childhood vaccinations, that will be used in the coming weeks to monitor immediate and long-term progress of the coronavirus vaccine program."
17990,So?
17991,What difference does that make?
17992,She said she wasn't going to run last year because polls were horrible.

18057,"[This study](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.28.424451v1) put the virus in a challenge test against high neutralizing convalescent plasma and after the virus developed E484K mutation (which allows the variant to evade monoclonal anti-bodies), it developed another mutation that gave the in vitro (LABORATORY CONDITIONS) variant ability to completely evade polyclonal anti-bodies."
18058,So FYI this means if the UK variant spreads and mutates enough especially with immunized people (vaccinated or previous exposure) it can also achieve this mutation.
18059,Yes a new vaccine could be developed against this mutation in some 2 months and another year for it to pass the tests(maybe shorter?
18060,don't know) but we could face similar problem throughout that ime.
18061,All we need to do is limit its spread.
18062,"Lol, sweet comeback dude"
18063,Except for all the animal and human trials involving tens of thousands of people.
18064,And all of the data that shows that this vaccine is safe and effective.
18065,it's not exactly propaganda.
18066,it's misinformation.
18067,crispr gene editing came about due to viruses/bacteria(?)
18068,having the ability to splice into genetics.
18069,it's a natural process.
18070,mist likely due to knowing half the information.
18071,trigger words that make it easier to cone to the wrong conclusion.
18072,"Well that's a whole ""chicken and egg"" situation."
18073,How are people expected to know the vaccine will cause the numbers to drop if nobody is willing to get the vaccine to allow that to happen?
18074,That's just an eternal stalemate that will only end when we the numbers drop because everybody got infected while waiting.
18075,"This sub is so depressing, but I keep coming back..."
18076,No kidding and the sky is Blue too.
18077,I‚Äôm sorry you wasted your time in college then
18078,Feels the same in Japan now.

18082,Absolutely nothing.
18083,"She can't be arrested, charged, or convicted of anything because, in the eyes of the law, she IS the country, which is why she has sovereign immunity."
18084,"She would also be basically immune from prosecution in most other countries, too, thanks to diplomatic immunity, so theoretically HRH could murder Prince Phillip with the candlestick in the library, loudly declare ""One is not sorry for One's actions, but do let the maids know One apologizes for the blood,"" and there's not a damn thing anyone could do about it, whether it happened in England, Canada, France, the USA, or anywhere else."
18085,In reality?
18086,"She would have to kill someone in the public eye for this to be tested, I guess (because otherwise it would just be covered up for the ease of everyone involved except the dead person), and even then it would probably have to be someone who wasn't a politician or a member of the Royals for anyone to kick up a fuss, but as the UK cannot retrospectivly apply changes to law, it is possible that they could only make it so she couldn't kill a second person without facing prosecution."
18087,"Source: my father, ex British cop with a law degree and an interest in quirks of the justice system."
18088,"HAVING SAID ALL THAT, the Brits have also beheaded one king, chased another out the country on pain of death, and had another declared mentally unfit and basically locked him up in an attic."
18089,"That means there is precedent in the UK to just get rid of troublesome monarchs by whatever means they feel like, so long as parliament does some handwaving to make it ok. She might not face prosecution in the courts for murder,  but that wouldn't mean justice is impossible to enact."

18394,"The lady had no symptoms or adverse reactions to the vaccine, and the investigation is currently going on."
18395,I would be happy to pay for it and have the money go toward paying more staff to help administer vaccines.
18396,I can‚Äôt believe people are rejecting it.
18397,Looks like a 36 week degree is all you need
18398,Out on bail?
18399,hahaha.
18400,"I'm in AZ and crunch numbers daily at /r/CoronavirusAZ 

AZ always has a couple days a week with very low reported deaths."
18401,But our 7 day average for deaths is 85 and I expect a huge number tomorrow.
18402,Over .1% of people in AZ have died from Covid19.
18403,Yeah living has sucked last year and probably this year too.
18404,We are just lucky we have never faced something like this before.
18405,Because of modern medicine and understanding of disease.
18406,I'd imagine it wasn't much fun living in the time of other plagues and diseases either.
18407,At least this time we're complaining about not being able to go clubbing instead of dying.
18408,Noice!!
18409,!
18410,Totally out of line
18411,Half of the mid-west is in AZ right SOAKING up the corona
18412,Maybe if I would be doing coke instead of smoking weed then my house would be cleaner but nah
18413,So my problem is that I need to do some cocaine?
18414,That's what I am hearing here.

18421,This is what I keep thinking everytime I see it mentioned.
18422,I promise I'm on your side.
18423,I'm not even strictly against half-dosing as long as the person knows there's a vaguely 1/4 risk that they're not immune.
18424,Personally?
18425,I'll wait until I can get both doses.
18426,"I think it would be better if we did, simply because it's easy to say ""if we vaccinate this many people"" but in practice the time it takes to do that will change things."

18446,"We are working from home (not by choice),  my children are learning from home,  no visitors allowed by law, even the playgrounds in our complex are chained off."
18447,Even going outside for a walk is difficult as the temps are going to -10C this week.

18451,Seems dumb that the restaurants are open and cafes are closed tho.

18479,Memorizing isn't learning.
18480,There are very few (if any) deaths reported on Sundays and Mondays... it's been like that since the beginning.
18481,We'll likely be over 200 deaths at least one day this week.
18482,Our 7-day average for deaths is at 85/day... and that's with us only reporting 3 deaths total for the past two days.
18483,It also takes about 2-4 weeks from the day of the death to be reported by the state because there is a bunch of paperwork to be signed.
18484,The deaths from the 17k cases reported yesterday won't be reflected in our death counts til mid-Feb at the earliest.

18498,It feels like it's the covert battleground between politics and conservative subs.
18499,There's been a marked shift in the discourse the last month.
18500,Arizona isn't even top 10 per capita in cases or deaths so I don't really understand the reference.
18501,And I've never heard anyone claim idaho is in the pacific northwest

18522,"Good, fuck cocaine and fuck whoever does it recreationally."
18523,Been on top of a few.
18524,"According to CDC estimates it is higher than 99.5% for anyone under 70, see scenario 5 here: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html

The infection fatality ratio is different than (reported deaths) / (reported cases) since many people infected with the virus never get tested and hence never get reported."
18525,Covid is bad.
18526,Drugs arent in moderation.
18527,Change the system!
18528,people are getting letters from their insurance companies telling them not to call and ask.
18529,"Feel free to mutate my DNA all you want, as long as it protects me from that fucking virus."
18530,Agree.
18531,One small nitpick is that the vaccine is currently being administered to those that have already had the virus thus making our vaccinations ~20% less efficient.
18532,"So if a mostly permanent immunity is assumed after getting covid, we can assume that we are essentially wasting X% of the vaccines, equivalent to the number of total infected."
18533,"All evidence points to long lasting immunity and thus my biggest qualm with current vaccinations is that there was not a huge push and messaging that if you‚Äôve already had covid, you should wait at least a couple months so others more at risk can get it first"
18534,Shit do you hear that?
18535,&gt;but a lot of other states like NY are clinging to this overly complex tier system that just makes things more confusing and slows everything down.
18536,"Cuomo: if you vaccinate a single person not on the approved list, we will fine you $100,000

Hospitals: okay

Cuomo: and if you have any vaccines left over, we will also fine you

Hospitals: ..."
18537,Note that this is not my main medical specialty but just did a quick literature review for IHCA (in-hospital cardiac arrest) in relevant journals.
18538,"**Overall survival to hospital discharge, between 2000-2009, was around 17%** (increased from 13 to 22% during study period)([https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1109148](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1109148)):

&gt;The overall rate of survival to discharge was 17.0% (14,357 of 84,625 patients)

In the 17% survivor group, 30% have significant neurological disability."
18539,10% have profound/severe neurological disability.
18540,Patients in intensive care from 2014-2018 have a bit worse outcomes as expected.
18541,"Overall survival from ICU in-hospital arrest 12.5 %([https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.120.006837](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.120.006837))

&gt;The overall rate of survival to discharge was 12.5%."
18542,"Rate of survival with CPC of 1 or 2 \[**significant but moderate neurological disability**\] was 9.2% and survival with CPC of 1 was 6.2% \[**mild disability**\]

Let's turn it around, i'll call it the ""dead or veggie rate"" following ICU in-hospital arrest:  
**80 years or older: 97-99%**  
**50 years or younger: 78-92%**

TLDR: \~17 % chance of surviving to discharge even if your heart stops in-hospital."
18543,"Rates have increased a bit during recent years, but not by a formidable amount."
18544,"In the very (un)lucky chance of survival to discharge, high chance of becoming vegetable."
18545,"If you're 80+ and the ICU, near guarantee (97-99%) of staying dead or turning grandpa into a vegetable."

18592,"Dose 1 is actually full immunity for upwards of 3/4 people (ish, not sure the percent off the top) without a second dose."
18593,Dose 2 brings that up to 9.7/10 who now have immunity.
18594,"The question that some people are raising is thus:

Is it better to have 100 million people dosed, with 70 million functionally immune, or is it better to have 50 million people dosed with 48.5 million immune?"
18595,"On the one hand, dosing everyone once creates more immune people."
18596,On the other hand it also creates a lot of people who believe they're immune but aren't.
18597,"What does 6 months of 30 million people (out of 100 million dosed) thinking they're immune mean, compared to 6 months of 1.5 million people (out of 50 million dosed) thinking they're immune mean?"
18598,"Specifically when none of the 30 million, or 1.5 million, are actually immune?"
18599,What's the tradeoff value?

18606,&gt; I'm saying that what I believe he's saying is that we're not at the point where random people are waiting for the vaccine because we don't have any doses left.
18607,We're at the point where people who've been slated for the vaccine aren't getting it because of inefficiencies in how we're giving them out.

18619,Family members of those vaccinated should get dibs on them so they can't be infected from the morons who choose not to take them.

18621,"Once the employee is vested, they won't lose the match money in their 401k account."
18622,The employer's matching funds are physically moved into the employee's 401k account.

18669,Some of NZ's very first cases came from Italy.
18670,The study specifically found that variants from every major group were present in NZ's first wave.
18671,"The NZ case growth was exponential, with an R0 of 4.5 in mid March and within one cluster the R0 was 7."
18672,That's as bad or worse than in the UK right now.
18673,Also there is no evidence Italy had a more contagious variant than anywhere else in Europe.
18674,The D614G strain was present all over.
18675,The UK has failed to stop the growth because they didn't lock down at all.
18676,They had school still fully open and the new variant spreads just as efficiently in kids as adults.
18677,In the NZ lockdown schools were totally closed.
18678,In addition in NZ anyone who tests positive AND all their close contacts are removed to managed quarantine facilities.
18679,That is not done in the UK or US.

18690,The other day I was reminded trump said they ‚Äúweren‚Äôt a shipping company‚Äù when asked about distribution of PPE and my blood boiled all over again
18691,Germany currently has vaccine delivery problems.
18692,"Of course, some states are doing better than others when it comes to using the vaccines on hand, but if the problem is supply (which is a EU problem due to fuck ups), there's only a limited impact the German government can have."
18693,It's still nothing compared to what we had in Spain in April.
18694,"You couldn't go outside at all for 2 weeks, except to go to the supermarket."

18696,And now masks must be worn at all times when outside or in public.

18748,WHO was persisting with this stance up until April!
18749,COVID is a respiratory illness with violent coughing attacks.
18750,Most respiratory viral infections can be spread through aerosols.
18751,To suggest that it wasn't spread this way initially was bordering on criminal.
18752,"While there was no evidence confirming it initially, there was also no evidence to support WHO's stance suggesting masks were unnecessary."
18753,I believe this incompetence allowed the virus to spread more than it would have otherwise and also gave ammunition to the anti-mask nutjobs that seem so prevalent.

18792,Nothing will change that.
18793,But then the question is why haven't there been any yet.
18794,In theory a country so isolated that no cases have come in could maintain that to stop potential future cases.
18795,"At a minimum, if you truely had no cases you could implement effective testing and trace protocols to stop any potential outbreaks."
18796,I'm not quite sure why its a question anyway though.

18799,we're almost certainly going to surpass 1 million vaccinations a day by the time Biden steps into office.
18800,This getting 100 vaccines in the first 100 days would be a downgrade.
18801,"I don't fault him for under promising, despite the circlejerk on this sub the US is second in the world in % of population vaccinated per day (and 4th for total vaccinated as % of population)."

18823,What's their excuse?
18824,"Also, what exactly are these ""loads of much better places"" you're speaking of?"
18825,The US is #1 in terms of overall vaccines given and #4 in terms of vaccines per million people.
18826,"The CDC specifies that there is no maximum interval between the first and the second dose, rather its optimal (as it has been already tried and tested) to keep doses 21 (Pfizer) or 28 (Moderna) days apart."

18846,Right.
18847,"No chance, too many are comfortable with this lifestyle and hopes of the government giving them more money."
18848,Is there a difference in the makeup of the first and second doses?

18854,all this shit and the vaccine is right here man....
18855,I agree except for grocery stores.
18856,I kind of never want to step foot in a grocery store again because the experience has been so tedious and awful ever since March.

18885,5% cut to Medicare &amp; Medicaid reimbursement rates for the next year and a $1 million per month fine for any hospital that isn't getting shots in arms.

18967,Even if I could fly I wouldn't because I am a responsible person.
18968,Unknown at this point.
18969,Even the 70% more transmissible is not really known.
18970,The way I think about it risk is increased ~50%.
18971,ie - a 20 minute grocery trip is about as risky as a 30 minute one was before.
18972,"I understand the annoyance at the backtracking, but as least he's closed the schools."
18973,It would have been worse to stick to his guns and allow the new varient to use schools as a breeding ground.
18974,There really is no.winning for this guy.
18975,"I hope, there is a bit of a scare with one of the variants I read?"
18976,Don't think they're overly confident there
18977,When I have the flu it‚Äôs way worse than that.
18978,I think Vietnam is comparable to UK in size but has a much bigger population.
18979,"97 million population for Vietnam

1,497 cases  35 deaths."
18980,"&amp;#x200B;

66 Million in population for the UK

2.65 million cases

75,000 deaths."
18981,"Sunlight changes are DNA, lots of things can change DNA."
18982,"&gt; Environmental factors such as food, drugs, or exposure to toxins **can** cause epigenetic **changes** by altering the way molecules bind to **DNA** or **changing** the structure of proteins that **DNA** wraps around."
18983,"- google first result to ""things that can change human DNA""."
18984,"[https://alumni.duke.edu/magazine/articles/big-question-can-your-environment-change-your-dna#:\~:text=Environmental%20factors%20such%20as%20food,proteins%20that%20DNA%20wraps%20around](https://alumni.duke.edu/magazine/articles/big-question-can-your-environment-change-your-dna#:~:text=Environmental%20factors%20such%20as%20food,proteins%20that%20DNA%20wraps%20around)."
18985,Articles like this are allowed but any article discussing origins of the virus are banned?
18986,Hmm
18987,"When there are thousands in a community eligible for the vaccine, how the heck is that going to be handled by CVS or Walgreens?"
18988,There will be 100 people for every available appointment slot and online reservations will be gone within minutes that they open up.
18989,We need thinking on a much larger scale of vaccination.
18990,Perhaps get FEMA involved.
18991,Hilarious
18992,[removed]
18993,I'm still taking it.
18994,"And I know everyone wants to pussyfoot and be PC, but ALL persons of color should be taking it."
18995,"But if it's not harmful, and if it's not contraindicated, and if you don't get much sun, and if it's part of a regular diet, and if it's not expensive, just take it."
18996,The idea is to remove as much contact with others as possible.
18997,Yes you can still work.
18998,"It's necessary for the economy, but we have removed much of the sociability which leads to the majority of viral spread."
18999,Workplaces can easily implement systems to make it more safe.
19000,A nightclub or bar cannot do that.
19001,Nor can people coming over for dinner.
19002,My state‚Äôs governor is letting schools reopen to in-person instruction Jan. 11 no matter what the incidence or positivity rate is.
19003,Schools have been closed since mid-November.
19004,"So everything must be getting better, right?"
19005,/s
19006,"God, I really really hope J&amp;J gets approval and has good efficacy."
19007,My friends and I had a series of big weekend getaways down at my summer house planned for last year that all had to be cancelled.
19008,Super disappointing since we had been talking about it since the summer of 2019 and we were finally committed to doing it in 2020 but then covid hit.
19009,"I really hope we‚Äôre able to do it in the summer of 2021, everyone deserves fun and relaxation after the hell of this past year."
19010,"Ah, good solution."
19011,Much better than my duct tape.
19012,I will update accordingly.
19013,People looked at me weird back in March just for wearing a mask.
19014,No longer.
19015,"And nobody questions the gas mask, quite the contrary."
19016,A few people will pretend not to understand what I am saying even when I raise my voice.
19017,"I was actually fooled a couple times, then I learned to pick out those passive aggressive assholes."
19018,Decent people will make the effort to communicate and not question the need for this relatively extreme protective measure.
19019,"In particular, I wear the gas mask when I go into a coffee shop for takeout now."
19020,"Even though most patrons respect the current public health order, there are a few who abuse it, for example by plopping a drink down in front of it then proceding to talk on the cell phone or type on their laptop for hours with no mask."
19021,"Obviously, this sort of abuse will soon lead to banning indoor eating and drinking."
19022,Pricks.
19023,"Anyway, even with everybody wearing masks in a coffee shop, there is a whole hell of a lot of leakage."
19024,It's simply dangerous.
19025,"Currently I'll pander to my coffee shop habit only with the help of the gas mask, but I have to admit, even that is a bit stupid."
19026,I should be getting groceries and absolute necessities and that's it.
19027,I'm also wearing gloves all the time now.
19028,Nobody ever questions that.
19029,I walk straight by the hand sanitizer at the store entrance.
19030,The gloves say on until I get home and drop them in a bucket and take the previous pair out to dry.
19031,Got half a dozen pairs to wear in rotation.
19032,"This actually amounts to less effort than using sanitizer all the time, and sanitizer is tough on your skin."
19033,"Used to be, I'd feel crappy just getting gas."
19034,With the gloves its comfortable.
19035,I'm not sure your understand what the R number is.
19036,The R number is the number of people an infected person will infect.
19037,"However, it is not the actual number of people infected by an infected person but a number in an epidemiological model that mashs together an factors affecting infectiousness."
19038,Of course a lockdown of a month will have a much greater impact than a lockdown of a week.
19039,"And of course a lockdown of a week will hardly make a difference in the number of newly infected patients, certainly not within that week."
19040,"But as soon as you impose a lockdown, the R number will change and go down."
19041,"And even when you have a lockdown just for a week, the R number will go down for that week."
19042,You won't know how much until a few weeks later when your data actually allows to model that weeks transmission.
19043,To be reasonably certain of your r number you look back a few weeks.
19044,The R number now cannot be measured.
19045,Any tips for the PS5 hunt here in the UK?
19046,I completely agree.
19047,"If that is something you are having a hard time with, I strongly recommend this mask:

https://shop.lifetime.life/boco-athletic-mask

Is it perfect?"
19048,No.
19049,But it is as breathable a mask as I have worn and it doesn‚Äôt hurt my ears or get wet with sweat.
19050,It has a slit for a filter and the fit is really comfortable.
19051,"I don‚Äôt wear one outside, but when I go to a gym this has been a God-send."
19052,Especially since healthcare is tied to your job in the USA...
19053,"When I left, there were at least 100 more people lined up around the building waiting."
19054,"They didn't say how many doses they had, but I was the 4th in line."
19055,"My community is being hit really hard, so it's nice to see folks getting it."
19056,All the anti-vaxers need to read this ASAP
19057,I think it'll be gradual.
19058,"As we see sustained rates of R&lt;1, ICUs free up capacity, and deaths decrease, restrictions will be lifted over time and we'll creep back into normalcy in the summer... sorta like we did last summer, but without the fall surges."
19059,"No, Japan did not start vaccinations."
19060,Thanks for asking.
19061,It's a disaster over there.
19062,"Two hours of paperwork, and a million dollar fine if you miss a comma anywhere in that paperwork, for a shot that takes about a minute to administer."
19063,This was frustrating to me.
19064,People are dying.
19065,We should be vaccinating 24-7 until we run out of vaccines or people willing to get it.
19066,Israel and Bahrain aren't good examples.
19067,They are drastically smaller than the US.
19068,That's allowed them to get a much larger amount of vaccine for their population.
19069,BTW they also paid a huge premium to be first (the US also paid a premium to be ahead of most others).
19070,"Gotta say, I knew america was gonna completely botch this from the start, but boy even I didn‚Äôt know just how right I was."
19071,A lot of terrible things I suspected about the USA have been proven true to me this last year.
19072,The saddest part?
19073,Nothing is going to change for the better as a result of this.
19074,"500,000 people (honestly probably a lot more by the time we get herd immunity) dead over the course of a year and the best we can hope for is a shrug and ‚ÄúWell it‚Äôs not perfect but it‚Äôs the best there is.‚Äù"
19075,"In addition to lack of empathy, I think ignorance is another common factor."
19076,They skim headlines and regurgitate talking points that fit their narrative.
19077,Masks are not the only thing..
19078,I agree.
19079,People can still fly for non-essential purposes.
19080,I have co-workers who have flown to Mexico and the Dominican Republic within the last 30 days.
19081,I have seen people dining in at restaurants.
19082,"To be fair with our infection rates, if they're traveling from outside the country they're less likely to be infected than your average person already in the country..."
19083,I fully agree!
19084,It‚Äôs no surprise because in France nobody gets the flu vaccine.
19085,Funny that the largest vaccine mfg is located in France though
19086,Seriously.
19087,Pharmacy school is typically 4 years on top of a science-related undergrad degree.
19088,As someone who has been recently accepted into pharmacy school the idea that someone could even get in without understanding that in the body it goes DNA ‚Äî&gt; RNA ‚Äî&gt; protein baffles me.
19089,Everyone is weak.
19090,You also even if you don't yet realize it.
19091,Willpower is actually a limited resource you can't use forever.
19092,WHAAAAT?
19093,?
19094,"&gt;If the first stage of the vaccine is insufficient to cause a strong enough immune response to combat the virus completely, then this situation is even worse, because all of the people who have 1 stage of vaccine are now potential vectors for new, antibody resistant variants if they are infected before the 2nd stage of the vaccine is given."
19095,Where are you getting this information from?
19096,You as well!
19097,Stay safe and let's make it through this.
19098,Cheers
19099,Not for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.
19100,Immunity after first dose ranges from 80-90%.
19101,It‚Äôs in the trial summaries.
19102,I don‚Äôt know about AstraZ/Oxford one.
19103,sorry for your loss
19104,"Yeah, I said their food performance was behind the pack, and their drug performance might be a little better and 'in the pack'."
19105,Though confidence there is questionable.
19106,What they aren't is leading.
19107,"90% of Americans:

‚ÄúI will not give up my freedoms, last I checked it was a free country."
19108,"Stop telling me what I can and cannot do‚Äù

 And 

‚ÄúSo many people are willing to give up their freedoms over fear of a virus that has 99.96% chance of recovery, masks and lockdowns don‚Äôt work!‚Äù

There."
19109,[removed]
19110,Ehhh he is right though - if we lock down and vaccinate 1-2 million vulnerable people a week then by Easter the country will be in much better shape.
19111,May still require some restrictions at Easter .
19112,I am optimistic that by the summer restrictions will be largely gone
19113,No.
19114,Takeaways are open but can't sell alcohol to go with your meal.
19115,South Africa apparently had a total ban on tobacco and alcohol sales in late March last year https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/08/world/africa/coronavirus-south-africa-tobacco-alcohol-ban.html.
19116,The varient is 150% more transmissible.
19117,Or 1.5x.
19118,Indoors talking to someone with no mask there could be a 2/10 chance of transmission.
19119,This is now 3/10.
19120,Outside perhaps there was a 2/100 chance of transmission.
19121,Now it is a 3/100.
19122,Does this make sense?
19123,The stock market is not based in reality anyway.
19124,It is the shell game with numbers
19125,Maybe you never went out much but pretty much everything is different
19126,"Yeah, a lot of states dropped tons of money on covid testing, the manpower for those huge operations are not cheap."
19127,"I think he intends to shift the unused vaccine to someplace where they will actually use it, rather than letting it sit in the freezer until it expires."
19128,No one was saying vitamin d was a cure if you already had it but there was so much evidence showing that over 80% deaths of Covid had deficient vitamin d levels.
19129,You would be stupid to ignore that.
19130,This just adds to the conspiracy theorists narratives that they want people dead and all that.
19131,How many people are you prepared to die so that you don't have to lock down?
19132,Unemployed/would be unemployed here got $1500 a fortnight to help survive.
19133,Yes but people are also weak.
19134,Some countries have oppressive governments still.
19135,Restrictions against what people say and do and strict penalties to anybody that doesn't follow them.
19136,This certainly isn't it though and anybody who thinks so needs a reality check.
19137,What did he say?
19138,I cant see it
19139,[removed]
19140,3 weeks in and the media is already writing post mortems.
19141,"Is anyone still blaming this on ""anti-maskers""?"
19142,It is a little rich how the US is one of the most successful countries when it comes to vaccinations and yet still so many people are acting like the sky is falling.
19143,This is correct.
19144,What is the point of downvoting.
19145,You should take it anyways.
19146,Can't hurt and most people are way to low
19147,[removed]
19148,"Yep, I definitely have."
19149,Otherwise intelligent people are still susceptible to conspiracies and cult mentalities it seems
19150,You are wrong.
19151,The American vaccinations is a fiasco.
19152,"Israel,  that is a country getting vaccines out the door into arms."
19153,"Fair point to your last point, but it sounds the time to pull their heads out of the sand has long since passed and they should accept that combatting the virus effectively is the best economic/health investment they can make right now."
19154,"If a person's identity and value system is tied to a certain group or political affiliation, they will reject information that contradicts that personal identity and political affiliation, even if they should rationally know the information is true."
19155,This does seem to be an issue where some vials have extra doses and some don't so scheduling the right number of people is hard (plus no shows).
19156,Seems like we should be over scheduling people with the disclaimer there's a chance they run out and you will have to come back but we can't let it go to waste.
19157,Glad your director put it to use and you got it.
19158,We were always at war with Eurasia
19159,"Most scientists are confident it works, so I'm hopeful"
19160,"There is no need to fear monger, but we also need to understand that eventually if this virus is allowed to keep spreading and mutating it will find a way to defeat the vaccine."
19161,This is why we cannot just go back to normal as soon as all the elderly people are vaccinated.
19162,We need to do our best to eliminate this virus worldwide or else it will surely come back with a vaccine resistant strain.
19163,"If reporting was the issue with throughput, we would have seen it by now."
19164,"[A graph of doses administered](https://covid19-projections.com/path-to-herd-immunity/#summary) reveals remarkably similar low output by day, dating back to the start of vaccinations in mid-December."
19165,"That being said, if the CDC counter updates between now and Wednesday morning to add more doses, I will moderate my criticism a bit."
19166,Supply is not the issue at all.
19167,Only about 33% of distributed doses have actually been administered.
19168,Capitalism is the new catch-all boogeyman.
19169,Yeah I‚Äôm all for masks but the people who say it makes no difference when doing cardio are very wrong.
19170,I think it makes it considerably harder at least for me
19171,"I dont think theres a great big conspiracy here, its just misinformation running rampant thanks to social media"
19172,"*""The U.S. coronavirus death toll is forecast to hit around 502,601 on February 4, while the country's daily COVID-19 death count is projected to peak about a week later at around* ***5,489*** *on February 10, according to the latest projections from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington."
19173,"""*"
19174,"Man, I sure fucking hope you get to make me eat crow on this one."
19175,What the fuck?
19176,There are probably individual nurses here in the US who have vaccinated more than all of France collectively
19177,The entire Leave campaign was essentially a response to hysteria so I can understand why you would expect nothing less from his government.
19178,Scammers have been selling D-vitamin for ages.
19179,"Not surprised it was not a miracle cure for Covid-19, either."

19182,lol.
19183,"You made the assertion that the FDA is ""in the pack."""
19184,"From the link:  ""Many of the processes to approve drugs in the EU are similar to those of the FDA."""
19185,"Is the EU ""in the pack?"""
19186,See I think it's mixed.
19187,"It's definitely partially not giving a crap about others and not thinking it's that serious but also for this situation, for some people it's a little bit of them trying to rationalize it as if they're ""doing their part."""

19189,Quite the opposite.
19190,"""Oh I'm JUST going to Starbucks, I'm JUST going to the mall!"
19191,"I'm quarantining, I'm isolating."
19192,"It's not like I went to a big party or on a trip!"""
19193,Even though going to all those places is the opposite of isolation.
19194,Holup.
19195,South African strain?
19196,?
19197,They can probably get into the main entrance and then some corridors around the hospital between departments but not into wards.
19198,Most of them are locked and you'd need to be buzzed in unless you're a staff member with access card or the code.
19199,So many Americans don't take Covid seriously until it affects them personally.
19200,Failure of empathy on a national level.
19201,Nice to see people aren't wasting extra doses.
19202,Nowhere in your link so they say it was first in Italy.
19203,"In fact they say: 

&gt; The first COVID-19 outbreak was reported in Wuhan, China, in December last year ‚Äì although Chinese authorities have admitted that there were cases dating back to November, raising doubt over the transparency of the official data made public."
19204,"What I don't get about all this is the fact that for most people life is, ""quite normal"" right now."
19205,There's hardly any restrictions anywhere.
19206,If you just drove around you'd never know anything was going on if not for the masks.
19207,Literally the only things still not back to normal are concerts and similar massive gatherings.
19208,Wearing a mask during a high-intensity athletic event like this has to be more dangerous than not wearing one.
19209,Or reporting.
19210,My state called out the fact that there is at least a 48 hour in lag in reporting.
19211,And there is also limited supply.

19218,The relative length of time with no public comment on it is notable vs. the UK one.
19219,It's plausible the initial tests gave results that are concerning and they want to have specifics before going public.
19220,Yes
19221,Might actually happen
19222,You think half dosing people will make it go faster?
19223,They'd have to administer to twice as many people.
19224,If they can't full dose people fast enough what makes you think they can do double?
19225,"E484K has already been shown to be neutralized by polyclonal antibodies, therefore I wouldn't worry about that."
19226,No idea about K417N.
19227,"Anyway, we should be seeing loads of reinfections in South Africa at this point if this was an antibody-evading variant."
19228,Are they happening?
19229,"Erm...you realise that most 87 year olds survive COVID, right?"
19230,Just stop ffs.
19231,Is it a regional thing though ???.
19232,I see that the numbers in  Madhya Pradesh and the North is far lower than in the South ... is it population density ??
19233,?.
19234,"it was a little bit more than the average ""facebook"" poll, it consisted of 257 questions that took over an hour to complete."
19235,"However, it is still a very limited research."
19236,"Majority of respondents were never positively tested for Covid, so their infection was self declared."
19237,"Furthermore it was biased as they polled people from Covid support groups, thus people with probably more severe symptoms."
19238,Also 83% of the respondents had a pre-existing condition.
19239,They do write that the research is valid for this context only and should not be extrapolated for a wider population.
19240,It's there in between the lines if you understand what they said.
19241,...
19242,They have Phase 2 data - that's what the proponents are touting.
19243,"...      
&gt;We have been following the discussions and news reports about reducing the number of doses, extending the length of time between doses, changing the dose (half-dose), or mixing and matching vaccines in order to immunize more people against COVID-19."
19244,"**These are all reasonable questions to consider and evaluate in clinical trials**    

The only way to interpret this in light of existing evidence is that it needs to be proven in a Phase 3 trial."
19245,"They go on to say:  
&gt;However, at this time, suggesting changes to the FDA-authorized dosing or schedules of these vaccines is premature and not rooted solidly in the available evidence."
19246,"Without appropriate data supporting such changes in vaccine administration, we run a significant risk of placing public health at risk, undermining the historic vaccination efforts to protect the population from COVID-19."
19247,"Again, no other conclusion to be drawn."
19248,"Furthermore they state:      
&gt;What we have seen is that the data in the firms‚Äô submissions regarding the first dose is commonly being misinterpreted        

Nailing it down:     
&gt;In the phase 3 trials, 98% of participants in the Pfizer-BioNTech trial and 92% of participants in the Moderna trial received two doses of the vaccine at either a three- or four-week interval, respectively."
19249,"Those participants who did not receive two vaccine doses at either a three-or four-week interval were generally only followed for a short period of time, such that we cannot conclude anything definitive about the depth or duration of protection after a single dose of vaccine from the single dose percentages reported by the companies."
19250,No data from Phase 3 trials to support modifying the current recommendations.
19251,"Finally:    
&gt;Using a single dose regimen and/or administering less than the dose studied in the clinical trials without understanding the nature of the depth and duration of protection that it provides is concerning, as there is some indication that the depth of the immune response is associated with the duration of protection provided."
19252,"If people do not truly know how protective a vaccine is, there is the potential for harm because they may assume that they are fully protected when they are not, and accordingly, alter their behavior to take unnecessary risks."
19253,&gt;We know that some of these discussions about changing the dosing schedule or dose are based on a belief that changing the dose or dosing schedule can help get more vaccine to the public faster.
19254,"However, making such changes that are not supported by adequate scientific evidence may ultimately be counterproductive to public health."
19255,&gt;We have committed time and time again to make decisions based on data and science.
19256,"Until vaccine manufacturers have data and science supporting a change, we continue to strongly recommend that health care providers follow the FDA-authorized dosing schedule for each COVID-19 vaccine."
19257,"If you think that's not what they are saying, you're just wrong."
19258,Should just do first come first serve at this point
19259,That‚Äôs what I was about to say lol...
19260,Still a long way to go.
19261,In trials a lower dose produced almost as much of an antibody response as the normal dosage.
19262,"If enough people get vaccinated ""good enough"" protection is good enough."
19263,It's a big issue.
19264,I rather they be more sensationalist and scare people to stay home because the situations in hospitals are really bad right now.
19265,"Those who don't die in accident, make it to the hospital, go to the limited capacity noncovid ICU, take the bed of another critical patient that would normally require ICU level care but instead gets downgraded to step down to make room."
19266,congrats!
19267,!
19268,"We, Denmark, will have finished given out first dose to all our elderly in care homes in a few days time."
19269,"It can be done, obviously the vaccine have to be transported to the care home and the jabs performed there."
19270,"I had one decide I couldn't possibly have enough migraines to need more than 9 imitrex a month, even though it was prescribed by my doctor.. fast forward, my doctor took her side, and their joint decision not only made me go without my imitrex for weeks (while I waited to get in to see a new neurologist) I missed so many days of work due to vomit inducing migraines, I was fired."
19271,She apologized aftery neurologist started doubling my doses.. but this is absolute crap.. they aren't doctors.
19272,"They shouldn't have ANY say in our medications, past reading the label to us.."
19273,"Good job on pretending that I said something I never did, and then feeling superior about it."

19276,The commentors hypothesis was that the SA mutation would be killed by current vaccines.
19277,You say that the scientist are not presenting a hypothesis....
19278,It's pretty hard to design an experiment without a hypothesis.
19279,"The experiment tests  the ""null hypothesis"" of the vaccine does not kill the virus."
19280,They are hoping to collect data that allows them to reject the null (based off of probability) and accept the alternative hypothesis ( vaccines kill the mutation).
19281,This is exactly how science works.
19282,This link is a crap example https://www.statisticshowto.com/support-or-reject-null-hypothesis/ but I was too lazy to find a good write up.

19284,"I live here, there is ample evidence of what i've said online if you looked."
19285,Have fun being a troll
19286,"Because we should always be relying on the knowledge of the experts, rather than spur of the moment feelings of the uninformed."
19287,"If the experts believe it's more effective to vaccinate half the people to the full dosage, rather than twice the people with half the dosage, we should be listening to them"
19288,It really pisses me off when people in any position of power U-turn so rapidly without an explanation.
19289,"If they turned around that hard there must be a reason but na, we aint good enough to know it i guess."
19290,What a fucking bunch of jokers.
19291,"Isn't, but why bring It here when we are talking about Coronavirus in a Coronavirus sub?"
19292,"If so, i will say that US have military bases around the world that some countries doesn't support or hat because of their exploitation by militaries (Iraq and even Japan, in Okinawa) and extreme security prison that is the news famous for not following some basic humans rights outside their country that literally called ""Guantanamo Bay detention camp""..."
19293,But what the hell these things have in commom about public health measures against Coronavirus?
19294,"Not much, just poiting finger at each other with no one seeking for solutions."
19295,See now?
19296,In the US it's a 6 year degree.
19297,"Typically 2 years of undergrad or ""pre-pharm"" and 4 years of actual professional pharmacy school."
19298,You leave with a PharmD which is a doctorate degree.
19299,Why are people being given a choice?
19300,"I agree not six months, but certainly some states went hard, and it‚Äôs worked really well."
19301,"We were completely cut off here in Tasmania, and had hard lockdown for about four months from memory (but we haven‚Äôt had a case since last July)."
19302,"Visitors still have to mandatory two-week quarantine if they‚Äôre from affected areas (currently Sydney), and we still have a travel permit system."
19303,It did feel very isolating to some people for a while but (a) it certainly wasn‚Äôt six months of hard lockdown and (b) we are so greatful that we have been safe and healthy for almost half a year now whilst most of the rest of the world is sadly in great peril.
19304,I wish more countries and even small island nations had followed the example of our premier or countries like NZ.
19305,France pushed for Sanofi not Germany and now it looks like it will fail.
19306,The phase 2 data I read aren¬¥t compelling and they postponed end of phase lll to end 2021.

19316,If it was green dots I would learn to dodge like the matrix movies
19317,No.
19318,It will take months for the vaccine to make a significant debt in the number of infections.
19319,Lol
19320,What happens then?
19321,It depends on how you define too early.
19322,"Unless you have something in place to prevent the next wave like strong border control ala NZ, Australia, Vietnam, etc or herd immunity from vacination then it's always gonna be too early."
19323,No one is arguing that reinfection isn't possible; the point of contention is your tall tales about COVID cases in the fictional village you made up in your mind.

19376,Lol

19402,"ICU are filled with Covid patients, the converted PACU and OR can only have limited number of beds."
19403,This sounds a bit extreme but I feel employers should do their due diligence better in terms of vetting people and checking if they‚Äôre conspiracy theorists before giving them job offers.

19414,"Also, as you could have read in the article, it is up to governors to push the hospitals, not the federal government."
19415,Huh?
19416,How is this a purely political post?
19417,"It's discussing the topic hand, no goal posts have been moved."
19418,As the handling of the pandemic was fumbled by the administration the relevant data pushed out the date for normalcy.
19419,"How is that ""purely"" political?"
19420,It's directly related to this discussion.
19421,"Apparently, France requires a talk with a doctor about potential risks, then five days to consider, and then a written consent form."
19422,New Zealand is an island country with sparse population.
19423,Not comparable to the US scenario.
19424,"The only country with similar geography and population who successfully eradicated Covid transmission would be China, but due to cultural differences China‚Äôs methods would never work in US outside of deploying national guard and military."
19425,Even then I would imagine bunch of wackos with plenty of guns and nothing better to do would start shooting for their right not to wear simple face masks.
19426,"So... i'm talking about public health measures here, not general politics."

19469,In battlefield or reverse triage you fix the people with the best chance of survival first.
19470,This doesn‚Äôt happen in American hospitals where it‚Äôs the opposite and you bring the most critical back first.

19472,By the time I got seen the hospital pharmacy had gotten so low on Tamiflu that they weren‚Äôt issuing it to people my age anymore.
19473,"I could have gotten a script to get it at a retail pharmacy, but they had all closed for the night and by the morning I was going to be past the symptom cut off for tamiflu to be effective."

19475,Take care of the sickest.
19476,"We are seeing that slip now, we are seeing the sickest not get care, that‚Äôs new for America, and part of the reason we spend so much on healthcare as we pour money into the sickest to save them and extend their lives, but that capacity is fading right now."

19485,I feel like there‚Äôs a certain Nordic country being forgotten about but we are not allowed to talk about it in a positive light...
19486,Our State health Commissioner talked about this on the daily press briefing yesterday.
19487,2 things stood out to me I hadn‚Äôt considered.
19488,1.
19489,Medical Systems can give everyone the vaccine in their organization at the same time because some of the Side effects will require staff to be out at a time they need them the most.
19490,So tits not like they can line everyone up and get it done in say 3 days.
19491,2.
19492,The Pfizer vaccine requires 975 doses to be activated at 1 time.
19493,"That‚Äôs great in the metro area of MN but for this phase when you‚Äôre getting your medical personnel, be even when we go into general public you don‚Äôt have the demand for that many in 1 place outside the metro."
19494,So Moderna will be primarily used for that.
19495,"Oh and one more, counted in the allocation from the feds, is the CDC pharmacy partnership, the state has no control over those."
19496,"should be titled ""hidden cost of half ass lock down""."
19497,"If UK locked down tight like Wuhan back in March, you would all be home free by now."
19498,"What ""belief system"" ?"
19499,And why do you keep doing this thing as if you analyze me or something ?
19500,You failed with it 3 times already.

19508,&gt;Sweet jesus that's even dumber than I expected.
19509,So proud of your ability to not look at graphs and arrive at conclusions.
19510,There are people literally denying it in their last breaths before it kills them.
19511,"Actually, the US has vaccinated the most people in the world, and is in third place for vaccinating percentage.of population, only behind Israel and Bahrain, tied with the UK at bloomberg's last update."

19520,"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/index.htm

Arizona is 2nd or 3rd highest percentage of expected deaths from all causes."
19521,Most of the death spike came recently.
19522,Why would they do this?
19523,Was the half dose studied in all phases?
19524,I‚Äôd say about 80% I talk to irl are against it
19525,I mean I didn't say I agree with her about her logic but there is at least one doctor I personally know who said that.
19526,I was quite angry when I heard that the doctor said that but I didn't want to get into argument with other people at that time.
19527,If you listen to what he actually said.. he never mentions anything about N95 respirators.
19528,It was strictly ‚Äúsurgical masks offer NO protection‚Äù.
19529,This idea of ‚Äúhe did it to save them for health care workers‚Äù is completely false PR to make him look better.
19530,"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis

""A ¬†working hypothesis¬†is a provisionally accepted hypothesis proposed for further¬†research,[1]¬†in a process beginning with an educated guess or thought."
19531,"[2]""

Guess pretty much equals a hypothesis."
19532,Indication of which is null and which is alternative is pretty easy; you have two distinct hypothesis.
19533,In this case it's easier to set up not killing it as the no difference.
19534,Null is no difference (i.e.
19535,doesn't kill it) alternative is that it kills it.
19536,"Scientist might want something to be true, but that shouldn't impact results."
19537,"I doubt many people in the world want the vaccine to ""not work""; but that doesn't impact the science."
19538,"I really doubt any of the researchers are ""neutral"" though."
19539,"It‚Äôs easy to criticise Boris, but he‚Äôs been doing all he can to keep this country somewhat functioning."
19540,"If he does a lockdown, people criticise him."
19541,"if he doesn‚Äôt lockdown, people criticise him."
19542,Boris literally can‚Äôt win no matter what he does.
19543,"&gt;Ok so cause for concern, I get it."
19544,That sentence doesn't make sense anyways.
19545,It's crucial to know how quickly an altered jab could be approved because at some point there *will* be a mutation that completely escapes antibodies.
19546,That's what happens with the flu.
19547,&gt; There is NOTHING trump has done to fast track the development of the vaccine what Hilary wouldn‚Äôt have done as well!
19548,So now reddit is back to hypothesizing what warmongerer Clinton would've done?
19549,Are you shitting me?
19550,Pfizer's cooperation is crucial to the vaccine rollout.
19551,Not even the lowest of the low have doubted that.
19552,"Because most 40 year old healthy people are completely fine, it‚Äôs the rare cases that get published on the news"
19553,This!
19554,"Every time I hear that this vaccine is trickier then a flu shot, it boils my blood, because it is not."
19555,"We have 350 million people to vaccinate and at current pace and with prejudices in place, we will never achieve it."
19556,"My friend in Slovakia just got vaccinated and she was not asked to stick around or anything else, but was given a simple pamphlet that explained possible side effects and what to do (mostly nothing) if you have one."
19557,I think it should start out available to anyone 60+.
19558,That should give more than enough people wanting vaccines to avoid wasting them.
19559,Ever heard of preaching to the choir.
19560,I bet this guy is already doing his part.
19561,That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs exhausted.
19562,Go talk to someone who‚Äôs not doing their part.
19563,Yeah I saw that and also thought it was insane.
19564,I thought Cuomo did really well early in the pandemic but he's completely fumbling with the vaccines.
19565,Can I ask what was in civil about my 5 word comment please?

19567,huh?
19568,i thought they would blame him for not authorize use of the vaccine faster and only use it himself....
19569,What point are you trying to make?
19570,How could the French government force the vaccine to be more successful?
19571,"It's a private company, which, mind you, is developing this in equal partnership with GSK, an English company."
19572,"Don't ask, don't smell"
19573,"Thank you, this is exactly what it has been like."
19574,Absolutely ridiculous.
19575,If you could vaccinate the 1% most at risk people that would make a huge dent in the Covid deaths.
19576,Only about 0.1% of Americans died from Covid in a year.
19577,Think about how much a 1% vaccination would do if it targeted the right people
19578,Oh no I haven‚Äôt done anything.
19579,I haven‚Äôt been isolated for a damn year while I watch all my friends and family go on about life... come here for some hope and read one depressing headline after the next.

19587,Can I ask what was in civil about my 5 word comment please?
19588,I was stating a known fact supported by verified sources over many months.
19589,Well you do have to do it again my friend
19590,"&gt;  not only has there not been warning sirens from the government about widespread reinfections

Why would there be?"
19591,"It's been predicted and expected this entire time, which is why vaccines are recommended even if you've already had it."
19592,&gt;that has come out showed less than 0.1% of COVID patients retested positive.
19593,"Yeah, because few people have had the opportunity to catch it twice with a long period of time in-between."
19594,Considering the entire pandemic started 9 months ago.
19595,"Most people who've had it, have it had recently."
19596,There hasn't been time.
19597,Meanwhile.
19598,Here in the valley we were in the fist wave of outbreaks.
19599,there has been ample time here for people to catch it again.
19600,"&gt;Moreover, recent news from the place you claim to live in has stated that they managed to test only 10%, not 50%,

they tested 800 people in my town."
19601,If they say 10% that doesnt make any sense either.
19602,"Because the town is 1500 people, not 8,000."
19603,&gt;Not a whole lot of data to come out with and claim that reinfection is some dangerous boogeyman.
19604,Why do you keep creating strawman?
19605,"I never claimed it was a ""dangerous boogeyman"" i never even claimed it was dangerous, in another post I link to studies about the other common corona virus' that infect humans."
19606,"They're so called ""common cold"" viruses and are well known to have immunity that last on average less than a year, but sure, if you need a strawman for a friend, by all means."
19607,&gt;I'm sure you got at least a couple of people to buy into your bullshit; I guess it's up to you to decide whether or not that's a success.
19608,Whatever you say kid
19609,Are we at warp speed yet?
19610,&gt;Sure.
19611,My view is that all the restrictions and rules do jack shit in a large country.
19612,COVID is seasonal in cold areas and you‚Äôre seeing the seasonality in northern US and Europe right now.
19613,"It has different seasonality in warmer areas, so you saw the patterns you did in Florida and other warm states."
19614,"Lockdowns or no lockdowns, mask mandate or no mask mandate, the pattern is the same."
19615,&gt;What do you care anyway?
19616,You‚Äôve decided to label me a COVID denier.
19617,Sweet jesus that's even dumber than I expected.
19618,P.S.
19619,"Stop deleting your comments, it makes you look weak."
19620,Whatever you cashed out will be worthless.
19621,The ptb will inflate as much as they have to do as to make the stock market look good.
19622,More politicians trying to step on the science.
19623,When will we learn?
19624,15 more days until we can really start turning this around
19625,There is already a framework in place for reporting of vaccine adverse reactions.
19626,"I mean, minor reactions won‚Äôt be reported, but if it‚Äôs bad enough that you go back to the doctor (or go into anaphylactic shock before even leaving), the doctor is supposed to file a report."
19627,https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/vaers/index.html
19628,But many people want it and can‚Äôt get it even though they‚Äôre eligible.
19629,Hotlines are overwhelmed.
19630,The people who need it the most probably aren‚Äôt tech Savvy.
19631,False positive?
19632,"There is only a single anonymous insider who made that claim, and that was reported by Der Spiegel."
19633,It also doesn't really jibe with reality.
19634,"* During July, the EU ordered a large amount of Curevac vaccines too (German/Dutch), and this hasn't delivered either."
19635,"We see no claims of conspiracy there
* The United Kingdom is also heavily invested in the GSK/Sanofi vaccine, since GSK is English."
19636,They also ordered a lot of them around the same time.
19637,Pushing battlefield triage on EMTs is fucking awful.
19638,It doesn‚Äôt happen overnight.
19639,"I mean, if you drink a little poison every day you‚Äôll eventually build a tolerance."
19640,The same goes for propaganda.
19641,"If you see something small, maybe it‚Äôs a jab at a demographic that‚Äôs contained in a funny meme, you won‚Äôt necessarily block the user."
19642,"You may not even linger on the image longer than you would others, but you‚Äôll carry on like nothing happened."
19643,"Say this happens a few times a week, and then one day you realize you‚Äôre seeing them everyday, and it‚Äôs multiple."
19644,"But it‚Äôs all in memes, and they‚Äôre from people you know."
19645,"You roll your eyes, but say nothing."
19646,And then you hear it on TV.
19647,"You don‚Äôt agree, but you don‚Äôt turn the channel or try to report it."
19648,"And then eventually you hear a joke related to it, and then you laugh."
19649,See where I‚Äôm getting at with this?
19650,Drink a little bit of poison everyday and you‚Äôll build a tolerance.
19651,If people don‚Äôt see just how bad things have to have gotten for this policy to be established then there is little hope
19652,The ships were a disaster.
19653,You can't use ships in a pandemic unless they're designed and outfitted properly for air isolation.
19654,"It doesn't matter if you say they're for ""other"" patients, covid will end up in there and the ventilation will spread it everywhere."
19655,"As for ""emergency tents"", as someone else noted, tents don't save anyone."
19656,Who is going to man them?
19657,In nyc during the first outbreak it kinda made sense- doctors were coming in from all over the country.
19658,That's not going to happen now.
19659,Covid isn't happening in one place.
19660,If you've run out of hospitals you've run out of doctors.
19661,And a ton have left hospital practice recently.
19662,There's zero evidence right now that the vaccine isn't effective on SA strain.
19663,Only scientist who says it might not.
19664,No need to get worked up on something that's theoretical and not proven.
19665,True
19666,"Yes, and it doesn't necessarily work forever, especially a. during this cold season b. with the UK (and potentially the South African) variant lurking around."
19667,I‚Äôm glad to see the world countries and taking their sweet time while new variants circulate the world and millions die.
19668,Where is the urgency?
19669,?
19670,Probably because they lead a double life and haven't been thoroughly investigated.
19671,"I agree, I'm glad they were able to extend the second dose a bit and therefore being able to vaccinate more people."
19672,We will have finished all our elderly in the care homes in a few days time (first dose) with 9 days to spare compared with the original plan.
19673,So far so good.
19674,"As a non American, I am always thrown by headlines like this."
19675,Why focus on veterinarians?
19676,"Takes me a moment to re-think, every time"
19677,She should get a UNLIMITED INFINITE LOCKDOWN FOR LIFE!!!!
19678,HOW DARE YOU destroying life saving vaccines!
19679,Any day now it's gonna collapse!
19680,We gonna quickly close down your buisiness and save grand ma!
19681,It's more the fact that they're setting limits when this thing is probably going to get worse (maybe a lot worse if the new variant sets in) before it gets better.
19682,"Even if the current limits are reasonable, it's a sign of how stretched they are."
19683,The next step they're forced to take may be less reasonable
19684,I feel like he needs to be more careful what he is telling the public.
19685,The fortnight of tier 2 is what I'm on about and is responsible for the start of this peak.
19686,That was a crucial time period and cases were nowhere near low enough to justify the lifting of restrictions.
19687,The rest of the country remained in T3 despite lower cases.
19688,Our second Lockdown also wasn't a proper lockdown and we have not been enforcing anywhere near enough fines to actually stop people breaking the rules.
19689,Lol.
19690,I'd gladly pay more than that to vaccinate my family.
19691,"In S.A we have baby clinics where they give babies get checkups and their shots at 9, 12, 15 and 18 months and they fill in a immunisation card which tracks the shorts and are presented when enrolling for school."
19692,Neither our hospitals or general practitioners or pharmacists do this sort of thing so it is kind of an issue when you need to start a mass vaccination program a large number of adults for Covid-19.
19693,Can't they just hand it out to the general public and you stick yourself like with an Epipen ??

19726,Waiting 6 weeks is much better than half dosing people or waiting 12 weeks like UK has considered.
19727,I honestly don't think the system nor people in general will be that close to the 21 or 28 day requirement that most people will end up being 4-6 weeks after original dose anyhow.

20109,It's so narrative busting that everyone just ignores it
20110,It spreads from presymptomatic people; people who remain asymptomatic throughout spread a lot less: https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4695 https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03141-3 And level of contagiousness is directly correlated with severity of symptoms.

20117,&gt; There is legitimate concern that this is how you will get escaping strains that don‚Äôt respond to the vaccine.

20119,Vaccine resistance is exceedingly rare (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6304978/ for a review and comparison with drug resistance).
20120,"I'd also point out that by targeting the spike protein, you make it difficult to evolve a replacement spike that both evades the vaccine (meaning, many mutations, across the entire spike) while still maintaining binding to ACE2 (or to bind to another receptor)."
20121,"It would be extremely ""lucky"" for the virus to evolve this significantly."
20122,"More concerning is the animal populations now exposed and circulating the virus, making recombination events with other viruses a bigger concern in my mind."

20127,"There's more than 350,000 confirmed dead from Covid in like 10 months."
20128,"The flu only typically kills 3,500 confirmed in a whole year (and only 15,500 confirmed dead in a crazy bad flu year)"

20194,"Almost: in LA County, if you‚Äôre in cardiac arrest, the EMTs will try to get you back to evil at cardiac rhythm, but if they can‚Äôt, they won‚Äôt take you to the hospital for them to take a crack at it there too."
20195,Nobody‚Äôs available to even try that.
20196,"Where I live, the state‚Äôs largest convention center has been turned into an overflow hospital."
20197,"It‚Äôs not exactly empty, either."
20198,Arizer Solo 2 is fantastic
20199,I can't find LSD or shrooms.
20200,Weed is everywhere though
20201,John Mulaney apparently.
20202,"This part is particularly bleak: 

&gt; The results revealed blood pooling in the brain (subdural haemorrhage) in 6 infants; brain swelling in 4; bruising of the brain tissue (parenchymal contusion) in 4; skull fractures in 4; a bleed on the brain (subarachnoid haemorrhage) in 3; and bone fractures elsewhere in 3 of the infants."
20203,Because they erred on the side of caution because they wanted to make sure it was as effective as possible.
20204,"Now that they knocked it out of the park, I think everyone realizes that the 50ug dose would have done the trick."
20205,Thousands of lives could be saved.
20206,Sometimes common sense needs to prevail.
20207,"You sweet summer child, you think Adderall is the hard stuff?"
20208,Helps you work on those mental issues we all have.
20209,"They can also help you break through any hangups you have regarding sexuality, gender or body disphoria, anxiety, depression, etc."
20210,"When combined with Ketamine, you can really get into your deep recesses."
20211,Everyone told us 2 weeks to flatten the curve at the beginning of the pandemic so I‚Äôm sure we all thought that this would be over within a few months.
20212,So no one was clueless.
20213,We were just lied too.
20214,Seeing them through what?
20215,Bankruptcy?
20216,"Most never experienced triage medicine, they will now."
20217,Then you will be a part of a small minority of people and your actions will have negligible effect at that point.
20218,&gt; He told Times Radio that if the vaccine did not work on the South African variant the shots could be adapted and that would not take a year.
20219,"&gt;
&gt;""It might take a month or six weeks to get a new vaccine,"" he said."
20220,"Anyway, I'm not going to worry about the new strain."
20221,It's not like I can do jack shit about it anyway.
20222,"I'll go back to worrying about covid-enhanced mink banding together and taking over the world, like a normal person does."
20223,Gonna have to build a wall to keep out the Americans.
20224,My coworker got an experimental antibody therapy.
20225,"He‚Äôs a regular Joe, just high risk because of age, weight, and pre-diabetic."
20226,"How is that ""misinformation""."
20227,It's information.
20228,It shows you how many people are done with the restrictions.
20229,"By pretending it's not true, you won't change it."
20230,"You may argue that restrictions are needed for a goal, but if a majority of the people refuses your goal, it will not happen - unless a totalitarian takeover occurs."
20231,"Hehe you really are simple aren't you

So shook you're double replying to comments ü§£ü§£ü§£"
20232,Lmao Japan rolls it out in like 4 days in March
20233,To be fair Garden Centre's - which the The Range advertises itself as (Home/Leisure/Garden) - can stay open this time.
20234,"Multi-function stores have no guidance or support to help them adapt to the new restrictions I saw announced last night, and the last time I saw shops get restricted on what they can sell (Welsh Lockdown at the end of 2020) the government got a lot of criticism from retailers and shoppers alike."
20235,It‚Äôs scary that Fox is one of the ‚Äúmore sane‚Äù ones at this point.

20240,They'll believe it when they need an ambulance and it takes hours to show up.
20241,&gt; Convincing you that it's impossible because the US is too poor is the greatest trick the current regime has pulled.
20242,I don‚Äôt think the person you‚Äôre replying to made that argument.
20243,"I think that‚Äôs generally the Republican argument and at this point I find it rediculous to take them at good faith on it, I don‚Äôt think the majority of the US believes this."
20244,We needed a national strategy all along but instead got political strategy from provincial leaders while our seniors in LTCs across the country dropped like flies
20245,"Deal with the UK strain first, then worry about this one."
20246,Says the person spending time on r/coronavirus who clicked on the post.
20247,"Also it's okay, you don't have to show everyone how edgy you want to appear."
20248,KN95 masks are not as good as a P2 or N95 mask when it comes to the seal around the face.
20249,"Usual story of cheap, half working crap from CHN."
20250,Is there any way to stop it from spreading around that world?
20251,Our knowledge of vaccine efficacy for the strain has nothing to do with its spread.
20252,"In LA, you have to wait for hours for an ambulance, then a wait in line at the hospital to get dropped off."
20253,Getting in a car accident is bad.
20254,Heart attack is bad.

20259,"""If we have another spike""?"
20260,"Given the traveling/parties over the holidays, I'd say that's a sure thing."
20261,I think for sure Biden will meet his goal.
20262,Much more is even doable.
20263,The us should have gotten more than 400 million doses by July so at some point 2-3 million will be vaccinated per day.
20264,Probably just doses for the high ranking officials.
20265,"that's also a minimum estimate, a billion is possible."
20266,That's 500 million people vaccinated.
20267,They just trying to rename the UK strain?
20268,You ever been to Arizona?
20269,This does not surprise me
20270,Look at the graph in your link.
20271,The R value drops at the beginning of the lockdown and remains constant from then on.

20275,Tf is wrong with you
20276,Thanks!
20277,Stay safe out there.
20278,Current worst and places that were hit first with limited knowledge and treatment as well as having a much higher population density isn't really apples to apples.
20279,"This is a whole lot of words to say ‚ÄúI acknowledge everything you said, but I think the UK is doing the right thing anyway‚Äù."
20280,They may be eventually shown to be doing the right thing.
20281,"But the data doesn‚Äôt support that yet, and we have data right now about things we *know* work."
20282,Ignoring the data we do have is irresponsible right now.
20283,Pfizer has explicitly said they disapprove of the dosing regimen MHRA is using.
20284,"The statement you pulled is them saying ‚Äúif the a regulator ignores us, they should make the most of it and gather data on whether it works‚Äù."
20285,"Which is a sentiment I agree with, but it doesn‚Äôt mean they approve - it means they acknowledge that the UK is going to proceed regardless of their opinion."
20286,"This is indeed a trolley car problem, and the UK is choosing to divert doses from people known to be at high risk like health care workers and the elderly in an attempt to protect the economy by getting doses to able bodied, younger people faster."
20287,Most of the rest of the world disagrees with this approach.
20288,The UK has plenty of doses available to offer a full regimen to high risk populations.
20289,They are choosing not to.
20290,"By the way, the ‚Äúmaking things up‚Äù sentiment isn‚Äôt just Reddit hyperbole."
20291,"Here‚Äôs a quote from the New York Times from a respected scientist:

&gt;	‚ÄúThere are no data on this idea whatsoever,‚Äù said John Moore, a vaccine expert at Cornell University."
20292,Officials in Britain ‚Äúseem to have abandoned science completely now and are just trying to guess their way out of a mess.‚Äù
20293,Don‚Äôt care I‚Äôm not staying home for another year for a 99% survival rate virus.
20294,Learn to live with it
20295,"Realistically you don't need 100% vaccination to reach herd immunity they are guessing around 70%, and even before herd immunity as cases fall drastically normalcy can start to come back."
20296,Le Big Mac
20297,a small number (0.01%) are vulnerable to short term reinfection.
20298,The rest should have good protection for some time.
20299,Anyone else notice it's AutoMods cake üéÇ day
20300,Quick question: How long do you predict the vaccine keeps you immune for?
20301,My worry is that once a good chunk of people finally become immune that the first people who got the vaccine will become vulnerable again and then the cycle repeats.
20302,"The post is about vaccine efficacy against the specific strain, not severity."
20303,Please try to stay on topic.
20304,The mods are very strict.
20305,"interesting, but wrong"
20306,Sounds like me
20307,You clearly do; being on this subreddit!

20309,Just imagine where we'd be if we weren't spending ~$7.7B a year on cannabis prohibition and instead used it on medical research...
20310,"No, he never said it would be over."
20311,He never explicitly lied.
20312,"However, there is a reason people, even people on reddit who are 100% on his side, feel this way."
20313,"If you listened to him very closely, you read between the lines and saw that he was signaling that we would be in this for a long time."
20314,"If you picked up his surface message, you would definitely be led in another direction."

20316,hell yeah bro

20320,"Short term memory loss for me, but it kinda makes life more interesting."
20321,So I just bought a small pen vape atmos I think?
20322,how the hell am I supposed to know when I need a fresh bowl.
20323,Also any recommendations for something with a larger bowl because I have to repack this stupid think like 6x before I am high enough to fall asleep and I feel like I must be wasting weed.
20324,I am on add meds and the weed is the only way I can regulate my sleep effectively but I hate smoking and even the 300mg edible I had did nothing so I really want this to work out.
20325,"If you respect him, then why are you spreading bullshit?"
20326,This isn't inconsistent with what he's said before.
20327,"To be fair, up until this point outbreaks at schools were kept relatively in check."
20328,"Definitely not perfect, but I think they've ""only"" been accounting for about 10% of new cases the past few months."
20329,"There was an argument to be made that, in terms of the benefits public schools provide society, it was worth it."
20330,I have a feeling these closings are related to the new strain and how difficult it is to contain (even with strict health guidelines).
20331,"Maybe they're even discovering this strain affects kids more severely than the previous variant, as well."
20332,"Of course, I'm just speculating, but something is definitely going on here."
20333,This is the coronavirus subreddit...
20334,Czech Republic is #1 in infection rate and the highest death toll since October per capita.
20335,"Slovakia, Slovenia, Poland are not that far off."
20336,About 8% of population was infected and mortality rate for 2020 is the highest since 1945.
20337,The last three months of 2020 would match the death toll of 1944 winter under the German occupation.
20338,"Can't find any god damn ketamine, for a little over a year(since pre-covid)."
20339,Plenty of LSD tho.
20340,y‚Äôall... idk what I‚Äôm doing wrong but I neverrrrr get high from dry herb vapes.
20341,it‚Äôs super frustrating!
20342,"I smoke from bowls/a bong regularly, and get high from that, but never *anything* from a vape."
20343,like pre-covid days we used to have friends over and pass the pax around while watching a movie or whatever.
20344,"30 min later every one else is like that [melted girl on the couch](https://youtube.com/watch?v=nEIYY5uvf5s) from the ‚Äúdon‚Äôt do drugs‚Äù commercial, and I‚Äôm as sober as ever."
20345,Ha!
20346,I‚Äôm taking one of you right now.
20347,üôÉ
20348,get tested and wear a mask around him.
20349,Also he should test.
20350,Do you live together?
20351,You are in a pandemic please stay away from him and get tested....
20352,is there an alert 6?
20353,That sounds like an awful lot of fun.
20354,Happy cake day!
20355,Thats meth
20356,Flu and Covid combo vaccine
20357,Thank you.
20358,Why would you ask this?
20359,Win Win
20360,I feel like I'm paranoid looking over my back
20361,"&gt;The pandemic seems like a terrible environment to be doing psychedelics in :(

Lol nah brah."
20362,"Hi, extraterrestrial here."
20363,What?
20364,A friend of a friend took a QP to their cabin in late March to ride it out.
20365,Lol
20366,Somehow I think Fauci's goal of 1 million vaccinations per day is going to fall somewhat short if they can't even pay people to take it...
20367,Won‚Äôt keep in your nose though
20368,&gt; That's why it's not so simple to just close them.
20369,No-one is suggesting it's simple.
20370,But it does seem to be necessary.
20371,Yes.
20372,You're crazy.
20373,Oooh.
20374,"Triage always exists, this is emergency triage meant for disasters and warfare."
20375,We might be in the same state.
20376,I didn't read much further because I have an educator in my family and I'm dejected and scared.
20377,Not like I gotta tell you but cases have stopped skyrocketing since schools closed in my state but of course still a marked increase daily.
20378,So in March schools closed when there were like hundreds or thousands of cases.
20379,"Then they opened in the fall when there were like 175,000 DEAD."
20380,"Then they closed in November and cases slowed but never obviously dropped and by the time our local district has everything set and ready for full in-person return we'll be closing in on 400,000 dead."
20381,I just wanna fuck someone's skull.
20382,Sorry but it will happen if I lose this person.

20384,I know a couple people making between 150 and 200k at Amazon that regularly do meth.
20385,"Does the fire department have an ambulance or is it just the fire engine and separate ambulance, like AMR?"
20386,Only 3 out of the 9 fire departments in Santa Barbara County have Paramedics.
20387,"The only fire department ambulances in the county serve Cuyama, UCSB, and Vandenberg Village."
20388,Everywhere else is served by AMR Paramedic ambulances.
20389,Triage is used when there are inadequate resources.
20390,Why are there inadequate resources now?
20391,"This is not triage at the level of prioritizing wait times, this is cutting people lose."
20392,Let's all do coke and fix up each other's homes!
20393,travel is also pretty down so odds are there's also a more limited supply and maybe even higher prices.
20394,idk tho
20395,I used to carefully curate my media to consume when on acid
20396,"They're not projected, they're estimated, using many useful, tried and true statistical analysis methods."
20397,"What's stupid is using known highly incomplete data because it's not compulsory to report it, to compare against data that is reported and even adjusted higher with the same type of statical analysis for the cases that slipped through the cracks of reported cases."
20398,"We can compare apples to apples, but for some reason you want to count only the apples you saw in the gift shop to the oranges in the trees."
20399,"at the same time, smoking anything during a pandemic of a respiratory disease seems... not the greatest idea."
20400,Prevention and elimination are not mutually exclusive.
20401,I don't understand why this is such a difficult concept for so many.
20402,You can actually get a water filter for your Volcano - the Obsidian from Magma Industries.
20403,Makes the vapor in the bag much much more palatable.
20404,"&gt;it seems to go stale in just a few minutes in the bags

It just does that."
20405,"If you can't finish a bag in a few minutes, I would just not fill it all the way."
20406,"But if you really want to stretch out your smokes, I'd suggest a handheld vape."
20407,Bags are great but really encourage an almost hedonistic style of smoking - just gigantic lungfuls of super concentrated vapor all hitting at once.
20408,Rocky road
20409,"I wonder if the average German would prefer a ""Germany First"" policy right about now."
20410,No you don‚Äôt.
20411,A doctor dying in a pandemic does not mean a poly sci major is now a doctor.
20412,"That‚Äôs not how it works, not at all."
20413,/r/vaporents they will suggest dynavap and I agree
20414,Does Cocaine go bad?
20415,"I'm assuming prices have gone down somewhat, so should I be stocking up for the future?"
20416,Does it have any downsides?
20417,Collateral adversities?

20428,When I would do coke I preferred to do it at home alone.
20429,My friends were always acting stupid and I‚Äôd end up being their handler and it was always such a waste.
20430,"So I started just taking it home, turning on some music, and either writing or cleaning."
20431,lol peasant states.
20432,1 lb is like $1200 top shelf.
20433,"But op is not talking about antivaxxers they are talking about most people, regular people that say hey the virus trials are rushed and we don't trust them so we want to wait longer to make sure that it is safe and there are no short to medium term effects."
20434,"People want to wait mainly because they don't understand science, as in-depth as you would need in order to trust that the vaccines are indeed safe."
20435,Most people are moderate and careful about their lives... Well More or less.
20436,Right on man!
20437,I‚Äôm a former infectious disease guy myself.
20438,I feel you
20439,Not yet they aren‚Äôt.
20440,"Let‚Äôs just get teachers vaccinated though and then they will be safe to open back up /S 

Never mind the fact that  the students families probably won‚Äôt be vaccinated until much later phases so now they are exposed."
20441,Bullshit!
20442,I just ate my weed.
20443,"And on that note, time for another bowl!"
20444,"&gt; They gamble, but we lose if the partial immunity due to the 1-shot vaccination regime leads to a new variant and to vaccine resistance."
20445,"The British knew of the new covid strain that is more contagious in September, and waiting until December to announce it to the world."
20446,I doubt they care if the 1-shot vaccine led to new variant and vaccine resistance if they can go to the pub to get a drink.

20468,Thank you.
20469,It's good to know what to expect.
20470,I wish there was more of a public service campaign about this or a concerted effort to educate Americans about what it means to be vaccinated and what one should/shouldn't be doing after one gets the vaccine.
20471,Okay guess I can‚Äôt use a metaphor.

20507,Cocaine is basically for people too scared to do meth when it gets to the point of addiction where you are losing all of your money.
20508,My sister is addicted to coke and the side effects are pretty much the same as a meth addict but she is paying a lot more for something that doesn't last as long.
20509,Keep that in mind when people act like it is no biggie because cocaine addiction is horrendous.
20510,"Don't fall into the trap my sister did, she would have never done meth because she did think it was a big deal."
20511,"Coke is the only hard, non pharmaceutical drug I see people act like isn't shit."

20513,"I recognize that we don't want cocaine, heroin, or meth to be behind the counter at the drug store with the cigs."

20573,"
&gt;Germany is getting the same number of per capita vaccines in Q1 as Canada, despite BioNTech being a German company."
20574,"Right now, with only one German-developed and American-manufactured vaccine approved in the EU, it's easy to say that Germany could have skipped the EU system of making deals for 7 different vaccines before their efficiencies were known, and just bought as much of this as they could."
20575,"Maybe Pfizer would have been happy to do a massive deal individually with Germany, and tiny deals with other individual EU countries, and maybe it would have worked out okay for Germany now that we know the vaccine is safe and efficient and quickest through the approval process."
20576,"But imagine Germany going all-in on the domestic and it not working, or lagging?"
20577,"Even now, it's likely that Pfizer wouldn't have made a deal that would have meant Germany doesn't need any other vaccines, so in the end, it's likely they'll benefit from buying as the EU even in this scenario."
20578,&gt;France has vaccinated 500 people.

20598,Could've started all this shit back in August rather than wait until now.
20599,"Not to mention, the bottleneck right now doesn't seem to be the total number of available doses, but rather the rate at which these vaccines are going into people's arms."
20600,Vaccinating the population still achieves herd immunity...
20601,"And I should add that the 30-somethings that are receiving critical care are not clogging the system, but they are there."
20602,"Car accidents, motorcycle accidents, GSWs, stabbings, TBI, may not clog the system, but they use the system."
20603,They fill beds.
20604,One blessing of the lockdown in our city was the drop in traumas.
20605,All of the local level 1 and 2 trauma hospitals saw a drop.
20606,It freed up many valuable resources that could be used by COVID patients.
20607,"But as people became fatigued with pandemic protocols and craved a return to normal, those numbers began to tick up again."
20608,From that perspective one could say that it is these trauma cases that are now clogging the system.
20609,"And granted, all the traumas aren‚Äôt all 30-somethings, but they sure as hell don‚Äôt have a median age of 67."
20610,Did you brush over the last part of the sentence where the efficacy of the vaccine is mentioned?
20611,I hear you.

20616,I just don‚Äôt support bonuses for them getting a vaccine they are getting before he general populace.

20618,Yep a worldwide pandemic is his legacy.

20623,"The Guardian does not have a paywall, you just have to click ""I'll do it later"" or ""Not interested"" and the pop-up should go away"
20624,Not really.
20625,Healthcare workers comprise of 5.5% of the USA.
20626,They have comparable age ranges to the general populace.
20627,Healthcare workers only account for .87% (as of last week when I did this math) of the covid deaths in the United States.
20628,There‚Äôs no evidence they are being put in more risk than anyone else.
20629,"It is true that frontline nurses are in higher risk, but all evidence points that their ppe and distancing measures at work overcompensate for that."
20630,That‚Äôs obviously great news.
20631,"The metrics about healthcare worker danger just do not show they are being hit by covid more than anyone else, in fact they are being hit less thankfully due to good ppe they have."
20632,Psychologically it sucks that they have to do this.
20633,My moms a nurse and it‚Äôs made her life a stressful hell.

20635,"Ok, add a teeny bit of salt to your water, and if you have potassium or magnesium round the house, take that at same time."
20636,Ideally you have some chicken or beef broth around your house in liquid or stock cube form.
20637,"Basically you are unavoidably dehydrated right now, which sends your various types of salt levels out of balance, which makes you feel sicker."
20638,Also makes water harder to absorb.
20639,Gatorade or sports drink is better than nothing though it‚Äôs got too many ‚Äòfast‚Äô sugars in it.
20640,Ideally you‚Äôd be able to get an electrolyte powder from the chemist (pharmacist?
20641,Drugstore?).
20642,"Berrocca, available in Australia, is my go-to rehydration strategy, although it doesn‚Äôt have enough potassium for me and I load that on top."
20643,"Broth made from bones is high in potassium, which is why it‚Äôs useful to keep in the house in case of diarrhoea or vomiting."

20681,That‚Äôs true but people who are dependent on alcohol need alcohol or else they literally can die
20682,The big question is whether a new set of human trials would be required by regulators.
20683,That would take months.
20684,"But even if it's only 6 weeks, that's 7 or 8 incubation periods for the virus, which is a lot with exponential growth."

20710,"People are expecting to see some disaster movie level apocalyptic scene... people running around the streets, bodies piled on the corner, hospitals with swarms of people in huge tent cities in the parking lot."
20711,The reality is a completely full hospital is still going to take most patients...they‚Äôre just going to get inadequate care.
20712,"At some point they may run out of beds and stop taking patients, in which case people will travel elsewhere for care, or go home and die there."
20713,"People will die behind closed doors, end up in a morgue or refrigerated trucks, and then buried."
20714,All out of sight out of mind for most people not actively being admitted to a hospital.
20715,Most people in the west wear a worthless fabric mask.
20716,"Not much point wearing an ineffective mask, especially against the latest mutant strains!"
20717,"Half of people I see have a nose sticking out too, either unintentional or intentional."

20734,What?
20735,Do you have any sources for that claim?
20736,The vaccine does not contain reverse transcriptase and your body does not produce it unless you are infected by a retrovirus like HIV and if you were it wouldn‚Äôt matter because it would only act on the RNA from that virus.
20737,"You produce the antigen because your ribosomes read the mRNA directly, your DNA in not involved the process."
20738,"If the rate of spread rises, they are in a race to vaccinate."
20739,"But if the rate of spread rises *and* the most common UK vaccine is ineffective, they're in trouble."
20740,We need information on vaccine efficacy in South Africa.
20741,And those who claim they will continue to wear masks after this is over are in the extreme minority.
20742,Those wishing we can make it into a permanent thing when sick are delusional.

20761,And it takes only one variant that can escape the antibodies.
20762,"Without genomic surveillance, we would be flying blind until it has spread so much that it is too late to contain"
20763,What varying context?
20764,There is just one context.
20765,General election turnout of 66% is low when when compared with other democracies.
20766,You cannot say something is breaking records when it's anywhere but top.
20767,Usain Bolt ran 100m in 9.58 seconds.
20768,That is a record.
20769,Me lumbering my ass same distance in 5 minutes 52 seconds is *not* a record
20770,"&gt;The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results."
20771,"Not until the 20th, until then covid is apparently our friend."
20772,"I assume 6 weeks is just to get the recipe right, but rollout would be months more."
20773,If they‚Äôll take the shot for $500 they can‚Äôt be THAT scared of it.
20774,Is part of it kind of like....   a childish sense of oppositional defiance order?
20775,"Or like, being contrary makes them feel special?"
20776,lmao Trump could have crushed the virus at the beginning if he said to follow Fauci's advice and to listen to experts.
20777,Covid is going to be his legacy
20778,Worst case scenario is we‚Äôll need yearly boosters.
20779,"That‚Äôs possible, but unlikely."
20780,Measles needs a booster every 15 years as adult (which I didn‚Äôt know about).
20781,"Herd immunity from 95% vaccination rate for measles is keeping Measles out of Australia, except for a few outbreaks a few years ago, which ended when adults went and got their boosters and the government tied family tax benefits to children‚Äôs immunisation certificates, which persuaded most of Australia‚Äôs anti-vax parents to get their children vaccinated."
20782,"Anyway, we don‚Äôt know about covid19‚Äôs booster needs yet."
20783,"Sorry, you're right."
20784,But *my* interest is the potential to thwart antigenicity.
20785,Severity is not the issue at all.
20786,"If it spreads faster, then more people will be sick because of the exponential spread, even at the same severity."
20787,"I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs implying anything of the sort, war casualties aren‚Äôt even the issue here."
20788,The point is more that the party that engages in veteran-worship also has no problem with letting them die because the President‚Äôs ego must be protected.
20789,You got the new strain too?
20790,Which country?
20791,"So they claim, but that‚Äôs after walking back the plan due to widespread criticism."
20792,I will not be at all surprised if a substantial number of people in the UK who receive one of the highly effective mRNA vaccines as their first dose will be given the less effective AZ/Oxford vaccine as their second due to supply.
20793,r/Winniethepooh
20794,Let‚Äôs recap.
20795,"Person says that the excess deaths are indeed caused by Covid because when covid surges, medical treatments are delayed, and people avoid getting care."
20796,"I point to an example where just that happened, and there were zero net excess deaths that were not Covid."
20797,"Showing that with the right response,  non-Covid excess deaths can be avoided."
20798,A real concrete example.
20799,I wouldn‚Äôt call that a straw.
20800,&gt; Fines.
20801,And we and a lot of hospitals are prepared to accept those and get started with the at-risk public.
20802,Bravo.
20803,And I wouldn't put too much stock in the potential fine: a story came out this week that distilleries were hit with an FDA fee if they used their facilities to produce hand sanitizer in 2020.
20804,"By the time the story circulated, the FDA was already stating that the fee would be waived."
20805,No government official wants to be on the side of punishing people/organizations who do the right thing.
20806,One year shortened trials based on a new virus.
20807,Science can change based on new available data.
20808,We still got to see more real world observation when the vaccines are more available.
20809,Covid already mutated twice in the first year.
20810,&gt; Making up efficacy numbers.
20811,No numbers were made up.
20812,"This decision was taken by scientists based on the vaccine efficacy numbers, as submitted to the US FDA by the vaccine manufacturers."
20813,"source:

https://www.inspq.qc.ca/sites/default/files/publications/3098_vaccination_covid19_2e_dose_contexte_penurie.pdf

&gt; The trial only showed 52 percent efficacy between the first and 2nd dose of the vaccine

52 percent efficacy is the overall efficacy for the first three weeks."
20814,"It includes the first two weeks, when effects from the first dose haven't kicked in yet."
20815,"Live music is a big part of my life, and the only 3 venues in my city have all shut down due to no business yet still having to pay rent."
20816,I don't know how live music will bounce back from this.
20817,Probably a longer lifespan yes.
20818,You would also need to stop the lobbies to push for laws bad for your health(still no daily recommendation for sugar intake?).
20819,But American people dont realize what they get from the military domination of their country.
20820,No one would buy the US stuff if they didnt have a gun on their head anymore.

20849,This is absolutely a lockdown.
20850,Also tier 4 was showing signs of beginning to work in London.
20851,I had the flu in January 2019 (so zero chance it was covid) and I had a horrible cough for a week and a lingering bad cough for a further 3 weeks.
20852,"That was on top of rampant fever, chills, pain, brain fog and other nasty stuff."
20853,"I suspect many people think they have ""the flu"" any time they have a cold above the neck."
20854,"If you do not spend a week coughing and crying on your sofa, it probably wasn't the actual flu."
20855,I'm not trying to harass you but from what you describe it's entirely possible you had the flu.
20856,"Which should be downright illegal, even Larry King has pulled through yet handfuls of 30 year old teachers, parents, you name it get clapped by the thing since they aren‚Äôt a first priority, the divide between the rich and regular has been blatantly exposed this year"
20857,[removed]
20858,Only under very limited and specific circumstances though.
20859,No worries...I worry about the population because I see a lot of people with covid fatigue and everyone really wants this to just be over.
20860,"I can see a lot of people thinking ""ok, it's over now because there's a vaccine"" and then we get massive amounts of people who haven't been vaccinated yet and they prematurely stop wearing masks and immediately resume their pre-pandemic life (which might make things worse)."
20861,I guess you‚Äôre right
20862,Not easily
20863,You could say the same thing about the hypocrisy of saying that BLM marches were more important than staying in lockdown or socially distanced because many more POC have died from COVID than have been killed by racist police.
20864,All these comparisons are fucking stupid.
20865,It‚Äôs a virus.
20866,I was 23 when the lockdowns began and now I'm about to be 25 with most stuff still shut down.
20867,I feel like I'm wasting away my 20s.
20868,No there isn't.
20869,People have already tolerated a year and hardly protested.
20870,The science says give everyone two doses with a short interval.
20871,However we can't do that because there are not enough doses.
20872,So in the short term we have two choices: Give very few people two doses or give more people one dose.
20873,(In the long term everyone gets two doses of course).
20874,The science doesn't have a clear answer to which is best because this experiment was never run.
20875,So if you have opinions on this you have to argue your opinion because nobody has run a scientific experiment on what's worse: Vaccinating too few people or leaving a larger gap between doses.

20907,COVID hasn't actually mutated *that* much.
20908,The vaccines target the spike protein which hasn't changed in any of the variants we have seen thus far and overall it mutates less than the flu.
20909,Read into the trials and you will see why they can say they are 95% effective the data is there.

20928,"You know, the kind of person who when facing the usual shit can just say ""this isn't my first rodeo""."
20929,A soldier that has never actually been out there and has only taken their oath just doesn't fit the description of the usual use for the word 'veteran' to me.

20954,not a shockable rhythm) at any time prior to transport.
20955,The new directive is that resuscitation will be discontinued based on criteria number 2 alone.

21107,No shit a farmer is not going to be substituted as a doctor unless things are so bad we don't have any doctors and we need anyone who any form of health experience or expertise.
21108,"What I am talking about anyone who is working in a hospital as a substitute for certain responsibilities they lack the mastery or profession to do; hence forth, you are seeing health assistances overseeing and applying patients in ICU which requires a very intrinsic education to properly use."

21122,*
21123,The government and the states have a priority system.
21124,Most of the states just gave the vaccine to the hospitals and long term care facilities.
21125,"So they have control, and are only giving it to employees, many of whom are deciding they don't want it."
21126,"So these places have all the early doses, and have to give it to the priority groups who either don't want it (sometimes they just want it later) or the companies are trying to do it slowly to make sure they don't potentially lose critical staff."
21127,It becomes a feedback loop of governments trying to prioritize healthcare workers (which is a VERY loose term right now to mean anyone who works at a health facility) and facilities trying to make sure everyone can work their next shift.
21128,"Plus, those facilities aren't really setup to do mass vaccines and have risk averse procedures in place."
21129,"Local pharmacies are the ones that do the heavy lifting of the flu vaccine every year, so they are used to it."
21130,But they have no access to vaccine and no legal ability to give it to people.
21131,So it's a limited supply of vaccine compounded by most states having no rollout plan in place and then relying on private (selfish) companies to do the rollout.
21132,"For example, I'm a 1a health care worker (group 4 out of 4 though), but there is no where I can get the vaccine when my turn comes up theoretically soon because I'm a solo practitioner."
21133,The hospitals just won't give me access even though I'm 1a because I'm not an employee.
21134,&gt;What was proven is that fewer symptomatic cases occurred in the vaccine group vs the placebo and no life threatening COVID infections occurred to date from people who received the vaccine.
21135,This in itself should be reason to get vaccinated.
21136,I do agree with this sentiment.
21137,"I've written it elsewhere, perhaps in my response to you, but I'm not anti-vax."
21138,I'm vaccinated to current and so are my children.
21139,"I don't intend to submit them to an EUA vaccine, however, but I do intend to remain quarantined in my home as I've been for the last calendar year as the trade-off for my personal choice."
21140,"I would prefer to wait for a more traditional method, like Oxford's, and for it to reach population use authorization."
21141,I will say the stated reasoning for not testing for asymptomatic conditions was the researchers did not want to burden the participants with weekly PCR tests (and they also stated they never intended for the vaccine to be used population wide).
21142,They didn't cite complexities or resource costs as their reasoning for that decision.
21143,"These companies don't have a lot of goodwill in terms of their transparency so some will consider if there were other, unstated reasons for the decision not to test these aspects of the vaccine."
21144,I'll leave those concerns to the people who have them.
21145,Highly unlikely.
21146,"Hasn't been studied for this particular vaccine yet, but science tells us you're most likely significantly less infectious."
21147,Assuming that people cannot transmit the virus before conclusive studies is not safe.
21148,We don't want people abandoning social distancing and masks before there is evidence that it is safe to do so.
21149,We're talking about a very big population - it is better to say the thing that errs on the side of caution.
21150,"I agree with all of this, but the question is, when stores refuse to go along with this, when customers go to the stores that are still open and police refuse to enforce the law, who will?"
21151,"I think that there is a national sickness that prevents a sensible response in the USA that makes any plan moot unfortunately, and I can understand why people would want the (terrible) step of martial law."

21212,"You are aware that these are the same doctors that have for years said that these long-term symptoms from viral infections are all in the patient‚Äôs head, correct?"
21213,The only reason covid long haulers are getting any attention is because people who have been ignored for years and told their post-virus symptoms are a mental disorder have organized covid long-haulers into a group demanding answers.
21214,"So, it‚Äôs like, what DO these doctors know?"
21215,Brain frog and trouble breathing for months after the flu have been deemed a mental illness by these same doctors.
21216,"Now, suddenly, it‚Äôs long Covid."
21217,No you are being inaccurate.
21218,Our leaders were extremely hesitant to call for elimination until the later stages of lockdown.
21219,"The projections explicitly showed the hospitals becoming overwhelmed if we went for a series of suppression-aimed rolling lockdowns, alternating with lessened restrictions (what most other countries are doing)."
21220,That would not be uncommon in general with pneumonia of any sort.
21221,There have been studies of various quality that have shown that even the most seasoned of marathon runners can become deconditioned after a few days of bedrest.
21222,"Their return to function usually occurs faster or is ""better"" than a non-runner."
21223,"That being said, COVID is thought to be not purely a pulmonary issue and more of a immuno-vascular issue which has different but overlapping problems."

21225,"Officer asked the captain if they should get the ""women and children in the boats,"" and he said yes."
21226,So the two officers in charge of lowering the boats (one on each side) interpreted the order differently - First Officer Murdoch loaded all of the women and children into the boats that was around and then would let men go in if there was room left.
21227,"Second Officer Lightoller, meanwhile, interpreted it as ""women and children only"" and just sent the boats down with empty seats rather than let men in."

&amp;#x200B;

"" The latest American Heart Association (AHA) Guidelines recommend two different strategies for field termination of resuscitation efforts (Morrison et al., 2010)."
21325,"For exclusively BLS systems, EMS personnel should consider field termination when three termination criteria exist: (a) no EMS professional witnessed the onset of arrest; (b) no ROSC after three full rounds of CPR and AED analysis; and (c) no shock delivered by the AED."
21326,"For ALS systems, the AHA recommends that advanced-level providers consider field termination when four criteria exist: (a) no one witnessed the onset of the arrest; (b) no bystanders performed CPR prior to EMS arrival; (c) the patient never achieved ROSC after full ALS implementation; and (d) no shock delivered by an AED."
21327,"In October 2011, the National Association of EMS Physicians (2011) issued a position paper on field termination of resuscitation efforts stating that EMS personnel should consider field termination when three criteria exist: (a) no EMS professional witnessed the onset of the arrest; (b) there was never a shockable rhythm present; and (c) the patient never achieved ROSC on scene."""

21363,We‚Äôre fighting a war and vaccinating only when certain nurses are off their primary shifts or when the hospital feels like it is ridiculous.
21364,The military exists exactly for these types of situation and they would immediately improve speed of delivery while ensuring whatever ‚Äúprioritizations‚Äù there are
21365,I am a 2015 PharmD.
21366,I work with a pharmacist who is very much a conspiracy theorist... And they openly admit it.
21367,They were horrified that I get my yearly flu shot and think high dose IV vitamin C is the cure to pretty much everything (including covid).
21368,The conspiracy theorists are everywhere.
21369,Some just hide better than others.
21370,Covid has exposed a lot of them.
21371,So they created whole program.. that failed to do the last mile distribution planning.. hmm convenient.

21373,"&gt; Even if the US managed it, there about 100 other countries all struggling with the same problem."
21374,The problem is mainly concentrated in America and a couple of other Western countries.
21375,The rest of the world is not in such bad shape.
21376,"&gt; New waves of COVID will keep coming for years at this rate, and the virus will only keep mutating as it infects more people."
21377,Vaccination is the only way to get rid the the virus and back to normal any time in the next 3 years.
21378,I agree that vaccination is important.
21379,"In fact, it is so important that we should not be rushing the process."
21380,"Instead, we should be keeping covid under control using conventional means, and then roll out the vaccine in a controlled manner while monitoring for safety."
21381,"Imagine if we are like Japan right now, with about a 1000+ cases a day."
21382,How would we be rolling out the vaccine?
21383,I was surprised when I first saw project Warp speed head Moncef Slaoui‚Äôs comment about potentially dosage can be halved.
21384,"It could be true but given the massive roll out, communication before approval is premature and only reduce Public‚Äôs trust on the effectiveness of vaccine."
21385,I would rather see the team stay quiet and FDA roll out new recommended dose in a nonchalant way if there is enough data to support it.
21386,Lol so saying a country's plan worked is somehow a window into my worldview and ideology?
21387,"You sound deranged, can't even admit you are objectively wrong in a single situation so you smear irrelevant shit on the walls because you think it makes you look big instead of like a child, hilarious."
21388,"Honestly surprised you even woke up from this level of head trauma, I'm so happy for you."
21389,"Not only that, but according to politicians on EU level, Macron apparently blocked the EU from buying more doses from Pfizer-Biontech."
21390,"He didn't want to see the ""German"" vaccine getting a larger part of the cake than the ""French"" vaccine from Sanofi."
21391,"So in the end, the volume ordered from Pfizer-Biontech was not permitted to exceed the volume ordered from Sanofi."
21392,Now it turns out that the vaccine from Sanofi might not be ready until the late summer.
21393,"Again, this is based on statements from German politicans working on EU level."
21394,Firefighter/Paramedic for over 20 years here.
21395,It depends on the state and the local medical oversight.
21396,"In my particular state, we have a specific set of indicators for pronouncing patients dead."
21397,The police can't do it because they're not medically trained to (they're not considered medical experts in the court of law).
21398,"If the patient doesn't fall into that category of indicators, they are treated according to their presenting symptoms and underlying problems and transported for definitive care."
21399,What looks like an unconscious and potentially dead patient to a layman could very well be an unconscious but breathing/apneic but still has a pulse and savable patient.
21400,"As someone else in this thread said, we don't transport corpses."
21401,Why tie up an ambo and unnecessarily involve a doctor who's already swamped?
21402,"That said, protocols do change with time and medical research."
21403,"Patients in cardiac arrest used to be transported all the time with CPR in progress until research suggested staying on scene and doing ""high performance CPR"" was far better statistically in terms of outcome, especially with the tools we have that we didn't have even just a few years ago."
21404,"So in that regard, transporting a pulseless apneic patient may seem like transporting a corpse but won't meet the definition until declared as such after all manner of appropriate treatments have been proven futile."
21405,This is different than making a decision of survivability of covid and we are in uncharted territory unfortunately.
21406,"This is the care rationing that has been warned of for months and I can tell you that no paramedic, EMT, or doctor wants to make that decision."
21407,"Updated research shows that half of people will have symptoms within 8 days, half after."
21408,"https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.medicalnewstoday.com/amp/articles/scientists-revise-covid-19-incubation-period-to-7-7-days 90% of people will have symptoms by 14 days, 99% will have symptoms by 21 days."
21409,"Older research that said half of people will have symptoms by 5 days and 99% by 14 days was based on incomplete swabs, it turned out that they missed milder cases, which have significantly longer incubation periods than severe cases."
21410,"Meanwhile, we have an avid golfer here"
21411,Can we admit now that conspiracy theories are a national security issue?
21412,[removed]
21413,"So finally, Quebec admits its unparalleled failure, and greets reality."
21414,The airports should have been closed long time ago too.
21415,No.
21416,Don't.
21417,Just move on and vaccinate the public.

21419,How did they know the virus existed if they hadn't isolated it yet?
21420,"How do you know what a microscopic ""plane"" looks like if you've never seen it?"
21421,"They never took it apart, the parts its made of are random genetic material floating around in an amplified sample of upper and lower respiratory tract secretions."
21422,"You bring up a good second point, that no one has ever proven that SARS-CoV-2 causes disease."
21423,They have never taken a healthy host and put the virus in it and seen a disease manifest.
21424,How do you do that with your mind?
21425,How do you trick yourself into believing something that you have no proof of and then keep tricking yourself despite someone pointing out that you have no proof?
21426,What about the hours-long waits at the ER for ambulances to offload patients?
21427,What about ambulances being so bogged down that they *can't even go out on calls*?
21428,"So now a family at home has to determine if their loved one, who just collapsed on the floor from a heart attack (or stroke, or aneurysm, or who knows what) is in ""survivable"" condition?"
21429,That's all crazy and unacceptable!
21430,"There are a lot of people alive today who had heart attacks or other health emergencies, and would have been considered ""pretty much dead."""
21431,"I appreciate that people are scared and in denial, but trying to downplay this situation is not helpful at all."
21432,Just my opinion.

21436,"https://kucusa.com/

I have ordered from both places."
21437,"*Here is the new update from* **Sweden (2021-01-05, Tuesday):**

*This is the first update on the numbers since 6 days ago - 30/12; Tomorrow is a public holiday in Sweden so there will be no number updates, but after that the previous frequency should resume - Tuesday-Friday number updates and Tuesday and Thursday press-briefings."
21438,"*

**Reporting of deaths over the holidays will have additional lag so numbers are expected to rise additionally in the coming weeks!"
21439,"**

*Last week's numbers at glance were: 2020-30-12, Wednesday: 437379 (+8846) confirmed cases and 8727 (+243) deaths*

* Numbers at a glance (previously in the post title): 469748 (+32369) confirmed cases and 8985 (+258) deaths
* The 14-day incidence rate in Sweden is currently 778 per 100.000; This is the first time the number for the 14-day incidence rate has dropped since the new increase in infection in the autumn; last report from a week ago was 842."
21440,"It is almost back to the level of three weeks ago 774 per 100.000 on 15/12; *However, since the number of total tests performed is expected to be lower over the holiday period it is still early to say if the lower incidence rate is a downward trend in the infection curve or merely an artefact due to the lower testing."
21441,In the next few days the statistics on the tests performed in the previous week will be ready and the positivity ratio can be maybe a better indicator of this.
21442,"* 
* In V√§stra G√∂taland the 14-day incidence rate is 842 per 100.000, at a relatively stable over the last month but high level; In Sk√•ne the incidence rate is 1335 per 100.000; Stockholm is now seeing definitive downward trend for the past 4 weeks and has 592 incidence rate - now lower than the country-average."
21443,"* ICU-care new-admissions continue with their plateau at high, but stable level of 160-180 per week for the past 6 weeks."
21444,"However, since the stay length differs greatly, even if new admissions are stable, it still means increase in capacity of the current patients in the ICU (still more admitted than discharged) - the number of current ICU patients has been increasing linearly since middle of December."
21445,"* Currently, 378 patients in ICU are with COVID-19, an increase of 39 compared to 6 days ago, when the numbers were last reported."
21446,"753 are the total capacity of ICU beds with respirator in the country, 617 are occupied, 18% are still available and 61% of the current ICU patients are with COVID-19."
21447,"* Today's report adds over 250 deaths to the total tally; Since there is longer lag in reporting over the holidays these are actually distributed not just over the last two weeks, but rather the last 4."
21448,"Additionally, currently there are 32 reported deaths with not-yet confirmed death date, increase from the previous reported 23 such deaths; few older deaths however have been confirmed as there are several singular additions in November and early December."
21449,"It may look as if the weekly deaths have reached a plateau since week 49-50-51 are very similar numbers = 470/474/476; However, it is too early to tell, as today's report included +17 in week 50 and +49 for week 51, which means these weeks might yet increase significantly."
21450,*  13 are the total cases identified with the new UK-variant and 1 case is identified as the new South Africa-variant of the virus.
21451,"Only one of the cases so far lacks travel connection, the others all have connection to travel to UK or South Africa."
21452,So far social spread of these variants hasn't been identified/observed.
21453,"* Current conditions for travelers from UK or South Africa are: travelers must stay at home at minimum seven days, regardless of symptoms; to avoid contact with others during this period; to test themselves immediately at arrival and to have a follow up test at the end of the period."
21454,People in their household should also stay at home and wait for the test results.
21455,"If positive, the health care supplies the rules to follow further."
21456,"* Currently, the priority group for vaccinations was only elderly in special housing and risk groups."
21457,"In several regions, however, there is hard pressure on the healthcare and they have started vaccinating also healthcare personnel, which vaccinations were planned to start at the end of this month."
21458,Now FHM clarifies that this sort of regional adjustments are acceptable and not against their advice.
21459,* This week the new advice for wearing masks in peak hours in public transport comes into effect - starting 7/1.
21460,Swedish Public Transport clarified in a press-conference however that it doesn't have the authority to monitor or eject passengers without masks.
21461,"Used masks can be discarded in the trash bins, however even with FHM urging local transport companies to provide masks for passengers, it is still mainly personal responsibility of everyone to have their own CE-certified mask when entering public transport."
21462,In some municipalities/regions it is possible to obtain mask from the transport centers when presenting valid ticket.
21463,"Main reason for the difference is currently, that having a box of masks in the transport vehicles might itself become vector of transmission if they get infected due to the many people that will come in touch with it."
21464,"* *The trade union Kommunal warns of a strike for employees in private care and elderly care, after negotiations with the employer party Almega V√•rdf√∂retagarna stalled."
21465,(source:* [in swedish](https://www.dn.se/ekonomi/kommunal-varslar-om-strejk-for-vardanstallda/) *) ;* at the turn of the year the collective contract agreement between the union and private health and care staff has expired.
21466,"The union pushed the new agreement to be similar to the terms that were negotiated for the public health and care contracts in autumn, with stronger emphasis on vocationally educated staff."
21467,"However, the first negotiations seems to have ended badly and the union has given warning for a possible strike."
21468,"&gt;"" - These are improvements we have made through with municipalities, with regions and with cooperative companies."
21469,"Only the profitable companies are left to negotiate with and they say a resounding no."""
21470,"**If the parties do not agree** on an agreement before 15 January, Kommunal will block new employment, as well as overtime and overtime at private health and care companies throughout the country."
21471,"These include the occupational groups of assistant nurses, care assistants, chefs and meal staff."
21472,"Thereafter, on 22 January, the union will close down the work on a large number of nursing homes and health centers run by the companies."
21473,"A total of 55,000 employees are covered."
21474,"====

**Please, remember there is lag in reporting and deaths reported on a certain day are usually mostly deaths that happened on previous days."
21475,On average it takes up to 11 days to report 90% of the deaths for a certain day (see in the links graphs about how that looks);** ***with the current holidays this lag has more than doubled.

21481,"Sadly, it is hard enough to make people care about healtchcare workers in the kindle of a pandemic."
21482,Call me cynical but no one is going to be remembering front line workers when this is over.
21483,The average person cares way too much about themselves and way too little about anyone else.
21484,"Sure, it probably helps more than nothing."

21488,"At least you're honest about your goals, I guess."
21489,Speed of vaccination is greatly increasing.
21490,Things are really going to start going this week with second doses going out.
21491,We need to work on improving the efficiency of the plan we have or making moderate changes to it to increase speed.
21492,"Maybe it's adding everyone age 75 or older into the current phases so we have a sizable readily identifiable population that we can vaccinate, but throwing the whole thing in the trash and just sticking whoever will save fewer lives and make less of an impact on the overcrowded Hopsitals/ICUs."
21493,"Obviously we need to get shots in arms before vaccines expire, but unless you're having to throw them away, it doesn't make any sense to be vaccinating WFH healthy 32 year olds already."
21494,I am pretty sure there was a post in this sub yesterday about CDC projecting US to cross 500k in Feb.
21495,Giving a very bad name to my future profession.
21496,That makes me really sad
21497,is there that many animals in the American army?
21498,"Whatever his mental issues are, hopefully he loses his license and his profession."
21499,Sounds like a class-action lawsuit waiting to happen.
21500,Especially if they don't another batch soon enough to eventually do that second dose.
21501,I'd be so pissed if they screwed with me on this.
21502,Prob related to insurance and minimizing potential lawsuit.
21503,"A few countries have done almost nothing, but Sweden is absolutely not one of them"
21504,Same as the UK strategy and it makes a lot of sense.
21505,I think it's the FDA (USA) that's taking more risk with their recently announced inflexible recommendations.
21506,"In a paradoxical way, the FDA's ""safe"" approach of only administering vaccines exactly as they were in the Phase 3 trials may result in fewer lives saved."
21507,I also think we'll be learning more about mixing vaccines in 2021 (e.g.
21508,"first dose AZ, second dose Pfizer)."
21509,"This process is known as ""heterologous prime-boost vaccination"" and although not formally tested, it has a strong rationale."

21516,?
21517,Well when even Dr Sanjay Gupta is saying we could be back to normal by fall you know something is moving the right direction.
21518,Exactly.
21519,This whole catastrophe was designed to happen since Reagan.
21520,"This has been our protocol for months now - no CPR unless CPR is started as soon as the patient loses consciousness by bystanders, and even if you do CPR in the field, unless the patient gets ROSC (return of spontaneous circulation - basically, the patient's heart starts beating normally again), they don't go to the hospital."
21521,Call the death in the field and transport straight to the morgue.
21522,"Sorry, bruh."
21523,"Jesus Christ, **3000** **human** **beings** in just one state are hospitalized with Covid-19."
21524,"That's insane, hospitals and their staff cannot handle this."
21525,Wear a Mask!
21526,"Smallpox, that's literally it."
21527,That was in 1980.
21528,"Was it a spike specifically due to Halloween, or just coincidentally after Halloween due to the weather changing?"
21529,"Seems really odd to me that a holiday where 90% of the population either stayed home or collected candy from people's doors would cause a spike, but the holiday where 2/3 of people went to indoor gatherings didn't."
21530,"It's easy to say, ""There was a spike after Halloween,"" it's hard to say, ""There was a spike *due to Halloween* but there wasn't a spike after Thanksgiving because people are just so good at following guidelines."""
21531,"Maybe, but they've definitely had scientists at their disposal telling them how serious a threat this virus is, and clearly not listening to them."
21532,At least the widespread mask usage has helped to reduce viral load and cut down on serious and critical cases.
21533,I get that these measures might be the only way to slow down this runaway train but how on earth can it be enforced?
21534,Not surprising since most people don‚Äôt get paid sick leave in the us.
21535,They can‚Äôt afford to take off 2+ weeks of work unpaid.
21536,They also may lose their job too(especially if they work a low paid job they are the worse for making people work sick like restaurant workers and retail).
21537,Maybe if the us would protect workers people would take off work when they are sick or when family members are sick so they don‚Äôt spread shit but I don‚Äôt see our government doing shit.
21538,They don‚Äôt care about the American people one bit and this virus makes it even more obvious.
21539,many tests have visualised this
21540,If the government is anything like it is in USA they will give you the middle finger.
21541,In USA they won't help people.
21542,"Was it a spike specifically due to Halloween, or just coincidentally after Halloween due to the weather changing?"
21543,"Seems really odd to me that a holiday where 90% of the population either stayed home or collected candy from people's doors would cause a spike, but the holiday where 2/3 of people went to indoor gatherings didn't."
21544,"It's easy to say, ""There was a spike after Halloween,"" it's hard to say, ""There was a spike *due to Halloween* but there wasn't a spike after Thanksgiving because people are just so good at following guidelines."""
21545,This is an almost impossible goal.
21546,Only one virus in history has been actually eradicated.
21547,"There are animal reserves for Covid and you need almost all people to be vaccinated for this to happen, with a vaccine that prevents transmission, not just symptoms"
21548,This.
21549,"When healthcare workers are turning it down, the solution isn‚Äôt to say ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt believe in science!‚Äù."
21550,The solution is to try to understand why and address their concerns.
21551,"Maybe tops 5% of the population is in the ‚Äúbill gates is gonna micro-chip us with the vaccine‚Äù camp, and I‚Äôm doubting that number includes more than a handful of healthcare workers."
21552,"I‚Äôd bet most of these people have their normal vaccines and so do their children, why aren‚Äôt they for taking the covid vaccine?"
21553,Let‚Äôs find out and address their concerns with the right science and messaging instead of dismissing them as idiots.
21554,You guys are clearly cool with being intensely restricted.
21555,"Come to Denmark, people don‚Äôt need to be forced to floor and checked because we are not arrogant Aussie blokes."
21556,You are exactly like Americans.
21557,I‚Äôll bet that you have never lived anywhere else.
21558,It‚Äôs not your fault that your world view is so small.
21559,Travel and see how countries should treat their citizens.
21560,Enjoy your nanny government.
21561,"As a scientist, I speak for my fellow scientists."
21562,You‚Äôre a fucking idiot
21563,Because it‚Äôs the government doing things.
21564,"Ymir you want those vaccines out tomorrow, then we better give them to McDonalds and reward people with a free happy Meal for getting their shots."
21565,He only did things the way he did because his supporters thought Covid was a joke.
21566,He even likened it to some hoax similar to the ‚ÄúRussia hoax‚Äù to ‚Äúbring him down‚Äù.
21567,I just about prayed that he would have an ICU-esque case with Covid that he would still survive as having a bout that bad that we and his supporters should visually see might have been enough to change behaviors nationwide.
21568,"Instead, he had a mild case and treated it like he had a cold."
21569,"Immediately went back to the campaign trail, too."
21570,I‚Äôm sure his supporters and possibly people on the edge about Covid took note of his case and from then on thought Covid was a sham or severely overblown.
21571,"It‚Äôs why you still see people at his rallies like last night, why there‚Äôs still a disregard for masks as masks themselves have become political here, debates on if lockdowns even work or not even though they are never enforced sadly, etc."
21572,"And just like how we‚Äôve handled this whole pandemic, the vaccine rollout is struggling, too, and now we‚Äôre talking about cutting doses in half."
21573,What a grind 2021 will be here in the states.
21574,"I feel the prediction of a general public rollout in the summer will be pushed back even more if we just keep messing up left and right, but man will it be a great day when it‚Äôs all over."
21575,It will be just our luck if something else comes out that turns out to be yet another addition to the coronavirus family.
21576,Thought the same but it‚Äôs only after 20 minutes of CPR without restoration of a pulse that the patient should not be brought to the hospital.
21577,The crew is apparently not deciding if 92 year old grandpa who is short of breath is worth saving.

21651,I'm not even sure it's a minority of the population.
21652,One likely reason lockdowns poll so well is that no one actually adheres to them when it's personally inconvenient.
21653,I don't blame the people who continue to hold gatherings etc.
21654,; no one has ever been able to give up socializing even in much worse pandemics.
21655,"For some crazy reason governments, full of people who feel free to break the rules, assumed everyone else would follow them."
21656,Too many of our ‚Äòleaders‚Äô are shitty role models.

21666,It‚Äôs unfortunate that those bad eggs ruin it for everyone else but that‚Äôs the way it is and we need laws and regulations to make the world better for everyone.
21667,So basically we need mask mandates and coordinated shutdowns and all that because too many people can‚Äôt be trusted to do the right thing.
21668,"They did an emergency approval only of this vaccine, a first of its kind, with only weeks of data under maximum political pressure and people are nervous about taking it."

21829,I don't think they can force employees to get a medicine only approved for EUA.
21830,I've heard part of the reason that VA hospitals are having a covid issue is they are generally refusing treatments unrelated to why they were their in the first place.

21928,"Every vaccine technology, from mRNA vaccines to the viral vector vaccines, were funded for decades to be used as HIV vaccine candidates."
21929,They were unsuccessful for HIV but because the ideas were kept alive and improved upon by HIV vaccine researchers they were available to be used for COVID-19 vaccines.
21930,You can  also make the argument that the 2P (turning 2 valine into 2 proline in fusion peptide to improve antigen stability and immunogenicity) CoV spike antigen that almost every COVID-19 vaccine uses is based on the HIV Env SOS**IP** (replace a isoleucine into a proline in the fusion peptide to improve antigen stability and immunogenicity) antigen that is one of best HIV vaccine candidates.
21931,"Basically, please keep on funding HIV vaccine research because even if the idea or technology doesn't work for HIV you can use it for COVID or other infectious diseases."

22045,Not to defend my current country of residence but they are building 25 mass vaccination centers that when ready will have the capacity to vaccinate millions.
22046,In April or May they will start distributing vaccines to the genres population.
22047,I think NL will be pretty comparable to other European nations in a couple of months.
22048,This was my thought process: send out a form that allows them to state that they do want a vaccine and what time of day works best for them.
22049,"If they opt in they get mailed an appointment date and location, if they opt out they're put on a list to be asked during the next phase, in case they change their mind."

22052,"I was mainly adding to the comment addressing the concerns with relying solely on an app, just as a more options thing."
22053,It's comparable to get a sense of scale and more importantly it may motivate a segment of the population that is non-compliant with covid restrictions to reconsider.

22065,He didn't catch COVID because he refused to wear a mask.
22066,Saying that is a slap in the face to the millions of people who caught COVID despite wearing a mask.
22067,He caught COVID because he had a close encounter with someone else that had COVID.
22068,Cuomo has actually been disastrous during COVID.
22069,His lionizations by the media is infuriating

22071,Yes I know they use such words.
22072,But it doesn't make it good communication.
22073,Something was up with the reporting that skewed things.
22074,Reported positives were randomly 2-3x higher for one single day.
22075,I'm not saying things aren't bad in AZ but the wonky reporting makes stuff like this not all that reliable.
22076,For all the same reasons as the US.
22077,How can the general public trust the vaccine if half medical workers won‚Äôt take it?
22078,Wtf is going on with half our medical workers?
22079,It's as if living in FL is a bad idea.
22080,The tests number is ...too low.
22081,Sigh..
22082,"Well, maybe by seven day average."
22083,But the Dakotas are miles ahead in terms of total cases per capita.
22084,At the height of the pandemic we had an equivalent of ~400000 (my town had an equivalent of 650k cases) daily cases in US.

22098,"In the unlikely event they do, they call a doctor."
22099,What supplies?
22100,People are waiting in a waiting area.
22101,"Regarding the testing, it's been tested in 10s of thousands of people for months and has now been given to millions."
22102,We know there's an outside chance of a reaction (which isn't any different than any other vaccine).
22103,You don't need special supplies or training for a person to wait and be sure they don't have a reaction.

22107,One dose of Pfizer and Moderna has been shown to have up to 85% efficacy in clinical trials.
22108,EUA approval is very different than full FDA approval.
22109,Hydroxychloroquine had EUA approval and it was removed.
22110,I agree the vaccine is needed and safe.
22111,But forcing people to get it is not an easy thing to do right now.
22112,The bigger issue is these vaccines should be going to the public if they're being turned down.
22113,They aren't because states haven't authorized it.
22114,That's a problem.

22119,You don‚Äôt finish your course of antibiotics and you have a moderate risk of reinfection with possible resistance.
22120,"This can go on to infect other people sure, but not commonly."
22121,A virus mutating due to partial immunity in way to make it resistant to current vaccine approaches is probably quite rare in comparison but the issue is a) millions of not billions of opportunities to do so and b) people can still be infected with covid despite vaccination and c) it‚Äôs already high infectious.
22122,So your point is that it is likely really uncommon for an individual to have it occur but the problem is the millions of times it will play out making it more likely.
22123,Further more there is precedent for something similar happening which is why the anti vaccine movement is alarming.
22124,Recently epidemiologists were concerned about measles vaccination rates dropping to only 80% as a vector for possible emergent immunity to vaccines.
22125,"We have a farrier for our horses, and he has told us lately that people have been selling and stabling their horses more this year."

22294,"Mandating it difficult because you can't reference a traditional FDA approval, like the normal flu vaccine."
22295,These are getting EUA authorization - which I trust but can be wrong - see hydroxychloroquine.
22296,And I'm sure our 50% of workers that are willing to take the vaccine is pretty similar to the rest of the country.

22404,"So to apply the same lockdowns, protections, rules, restrictions, etc."
22405,to 100% of the population doesn't really make sense.

22407,"The same is true of many other risks like drunk driving, cancer, etc."
22408,the risks are concentrated in certain segments of the population and so the protections are focused on those segments.

22428,Where do I find it because I did a search and found that this story hadn't been posted.
22429,So how do I search for other stories that are similar but not the one I posted?
22430,"The reason hospitals can't require the covid vaccine is because it's not fully FDA approved, it only has an emergency use authorization."
22431,"This means the preliminary studies came back saying it was safe and effective, but more studies are needed to be fully confident in that result."
22432,"It's given emergency authorization so that those who want it can take it, but it's not ethical to force someone to take a vaccine that hasn't gone through the full testing process."
22433,Obviously scientists will continue to study the vaccine as it's rolled out and in due time it will receive full FDA approval.
22434,"At that point it will be fair to require people to take it as a condition of employment, but until then it needs to only go to those who choose to get it of their own volition."
22435,Let's see if this stays up?
22436,"I‚Äôve heard on the news that data has been lagging so it might be much higher than what they‚Äôre reporting, but who knows."

22441,"TBH, the logical thing to do would have been to follow suit with the rest of the world and take actual measures against the virus."

22453,Brilliant idea idiot.
22454,"Yeah, me and you are in agreement."
22455,The increase in case severity is real and not just an artifact of the hospitals overcrowding.
22456,That's a ridiculously low amount of testing.
22457,Don't you remember the initial group of doctors in Wuhan who first got together in a group chat to talk about what they were seeing?
22458,They were thrown in jail.
22459,No they can stay in the freezer for a long time.
22460,"The waste you hear about is mostly them booking 500 people for a day and thawing that much vaccine, and then say 495 show up, the 5 doses are creating a problem how to ‚Äúuse‚Äù them."
22461,I estimate that well under 5% is being wasted right now - probably closer to 1%.
22462,My friend opened their clinic (hospital pharmacy) to people waiting in line for the remainder at the end of the day.
22463,"&lt;1,000 people waited for almost 16 hours for what ended up being 2 shots given to public."
22464,"Most people were cramped in line (ie not 6 ft), fights were started, they had to call the police to monitor the line."
22465,They ended up stopping it.
22466,Yeah I just.
22467,"Don't agree with a calculus where one side of the scale is ""useless eaters"" and the other side is ""the economy and those who matter""."
22468,I think it's possible we could care for those who don't traditionally add income to society without making them the thing we must cut in austerity.
22469,"Surely we could build a few less jets that don't fly, and set up, idk, better nursing homes with actually working levels of staff."
22470,He still crying because his incomptent ass was beaten.
22471,No wonder they dont have any food in their hospitals.
22472,In NYC I went to a Northwell ER and stayed for several hours (who doesn't) and wondering when I could get something to eat.
22473,When I enquired about some food I was told that they didn't have any food.
22474,They've got the nerve to sue patients maybe if they had comparable ER services people would pay their bills.
22475,And not one of them had made it past small early phase trials.
22476,In labs you select for mutations by creating an environment for a virus to mutate how you want.
22477,"I‚Äôm not claiming that it will happen, just that it could."
22478,"Secondly, although different than antibiotic resistance, evolution is evolution."
22479,This isn‚Äôt pseudoscience and if you don‚Äôt believe me then fine.
22480,I feel no burden of proof to back up evolution or how viruses are selected for in labs.
22481,"To anyone else reading this I‚Äôm am not saying it WILL happen, just that it is a possibility and it should be considered before changing regimen for vaccine distribution."
22482,"It was his guest, John Ioannidis, that brought it up and they had both looked at the data and agreed a half dose from the Moderna vaccine is equally as effective."
22483,Peter Attia is a Medical Doctor who did some early work on Covid but generally focuses on longevity and health in his lab and with his practice.
22484,John Ioannidis is a researcher who has been heavily involved with Covid and the research behind it since day 1.
22485,Highly credible source and a man who knows how to interpret data.
22486,If this headline surprises you then you're probably part of the problem.
22487,My grandpa in a care home has been vaccinated (Washington state).
22488,We haven't even vaccinated every front line hospital worker.
22489,[deleted]
22490,Embarrassing is a fucking understatement.
22491,"I was sick for weeks in April and couldn't get a test until week 5 post-symptom onset because I wasn't a frontline worker, elderly and didn't come from China or Italy."
22492,"I couldn't get an antibody test, because while the US, Europe and Asia had them available to the public, we didn't get them till a month or two ago."
22493,"And now, we're on another half ass lockdown, our own politicians are going on vacations and going to extreme lengths to lie to the public about it, the press briefings have recorded clips of them saying they're just reading off a page, and our speed of vaccination is mediocre to put it lightly."

22496,"In Australia, we call them diggers."
22497,Yes I wish they would report that too.
22498,"They are just reporting doses administered, and you obviously can't just divide by two because it's a mix of people's first and second doses."
22499,I have been watching this almost daily for the past week and it updates like every 2 or 3 days.
22500,They say it's supposed to be updated multiple times per day but it has not been.
22501,I am not exactly sure how the data is collected and tabulated.
22502,"It was at about 2.6 million 4 days ago, 4.2 million 2 days ago, and now 4.6 million."
22503,"I would like to see a trend line as well, but I haven't found that."
22504,"I am also a little skeptical of some of the round numbers, like it says that 300,000 doses have been administered in New York, and on a previous update it was 170,000."
22505,I dunno that just sounds suspicious...
22506,Well now I have a sad.
22507,&gt; and in clinical trials for years prior to covid existing for other viruses and cancers...
22508,But you‚Äôre excluding a lot of details here.
22509,"mRNA vaccines have been in trials for years prior to covid, but nearly all of those trials were failures."
22510,"Granted, most from my understanding weren‚Äôt failures from safety concerns but failures from efficiency, primarily related to the delivery system."
22511,"Regardless, it is only in the past few years that this technology proved theoretically possible, and COVID is the first use of it on a large scale."
22512,"As another commenter noted, it is an EUA for a reason -it hasn‚Äôt been approved before this."
22513,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't the shots currently available only effective at preventing symptoms/illness, not actually stopping the spread, hence the requirement to wear masks and social distance even after the two shots?"
22514,"The traditional vaccines aren't out yet, I believe Johnson and Johnson is going to be one of the first traditional vaccines, that prevents people from spreading it in addition to stopping symptoms."
22515,"So I agree young and healthy people should get the traditional vaccine, but not the ones available now, only because older people are the ones who are dying by and large, so giving older people priority for the Pfizer and Moderna is more important, as well as to healthcare workers because if they're sick at home or dying they can't help others at the hospital or nursing facilities."
22516,"Besides, young people will be incentivized to get the traditional vaccine because it will allow them to not have to wear masks or social distance, right now the only incentive is to prevent them from having symptoms, when most young people don't experience severe symptoms."
22517,"Again, that's assuming if everything I've read is right about Pfizer and Moderna not preventing spread of covid, only symptoms and illness."
22518,"A lot of people would get assaulted, trampled, or worse."
22519,Anyone making new episodes of a medical drama cannot avoid that elephant in the room.
22520,"&gt; Pink slip is not an option for an emergency use authorization

It's not?"
22521,"Isn't at-will employment pretty much ""do whatever we say, or you're fired?"""
22522,"Thats the crux of the issue, the anecdotes aren't helpful but the medical data is also lacking because the patients claims of symptoms are too difficult to measure."
22523,This puts doctors in a position where they are forced to go by their past experience.
22524,My assumption is that a lot of doctors are skeptical because they deal with people who try to game the system when it comes to chronic illness.
22525,Takes a few weeks for people to die from covid19.
22526,Provided they get to hospital and have it confirmed.
22527,What's worrying the NHS is that lead time between confirmed cases &amp; serious symptoms.
22528,"I really hope it holds up, we don‚Äôt need anymore problems."
22529,When combating uneducated and emotional decision making (e.g.
22530,vaccines are bad) it has been shown that personal anecdotes are more effective argument than facts or data.
22531,"Not logical or meaningful, but we are told it is effective."
22532,"He said right now he can immediately and forever take away their license, and then they are passing a bill to make it a criminal offense in his press conference yesterday."
22533,"And the ""backlash"" is the fact that you even know about it."
22534,"People got called out for getting vaccinated, all while millions of doses are sitting unused."
22535,I literally cannot craft a way to fuck this up more.
22536,Why is it so hard for people to comply?
22537,Do you really think the govt wants to lockdown?
22538,"If we do a hard, full stop lockdown for like a month where no one can leave their homes (outside of emergencies) this thing would be over."
22539,&gt; Honestly they suck at this.
22540,No federal funding so it's a shit situation.

22658,France went for a process that requires a checkup with a doctor that definitely slowed the start over the holidays.

22899,"From the [FDA's statement](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-statement-following-authorized-dosing-schedules-covid-19-vaccines):

&gt;As the first round of vaccine recipients become eligible to receive their second dose, we want to remind the public about the importance of receiving COVID-19 vaccines according to how they‚Äôve been authorized by the FDA in order to safely receive the level of protection observed in the large randomized trials supporting their effectiveness."
22900,"&gt;We have been following the discussions and news reports about reducing the number of doses, extending the length of time between doses, changing the dose (half-dose), or mixing and matching vaccines in order to immunize more people against COVID-19."
22901,These are all reasonable questions to consider and evaluate in clinical trials.
22902,"&gt;However, at this time, suggesting changes to the FDA-authorized dosing or schedules of these vaccines is premature and not rooted solidly in the available evidence."
22903,"Without appropriate data supporting such changes in vaccine administration, we run a significant risk of placing public health at risk, undermining the historic vaccination efforts to protect the population from COVID-19."
22904,&gt;The available data continue to support the use of two specified doses of each authorized vaccine at specified intervals.

23067,But we are back now of course.
23068,I worked from home for 13 years prior to this job.

23165,"Like you said, nobody can stop a spreading virus if there's a back door wide open to let it into the communities, such as travel."
23166,"I do understand in March, the stay-at-home orders across the country were designed specifically to prevent a mass influx of patients going into the ICU, overwhelming the hospitals, but if we had shifted the focus and priorities to instead staying at home to stop the epidemic in the country, then it would've prevented the hospital crowds and it would've stopped the virus."

23219,"At this point, it‚Äôs the best thing you can do right now, right?"
23220,The idea of a lockdown to slow the spread was the goal way back in March almost globally then we all went our separate ways (most definitely here in the states).
23221,Us in the states desperately need something like this in certain regions where hospitals are basically fucked so that they can get back to normal levels.
23222,It‚Äôs never been about killing the virus entirely but just slowing the spread down.
23223,"With the advent of vaccines, this might even be better as once the lockdown is lifted, people will have better protection that they might have been allowed to get at a medical appointment during the lockdown than just using a mask or social distancing, further slowing the spread."
23224,"It seems like a common sense gameplan for most areas seriously affected by Covid now would follow this:

-	Implement a lockdown for a month, and make the focus be on no spread to the best of your ability and the administration of vaccines heavily as the latter will help with the next steps
-	Lift lockdown and tack on a few restrictions on stuff
-	As vaccine numbers rise, ease restrictions
-	As more and more data comes out that the vaccine truly has been working, keep on easing those restrictions

I feel if done correctly, it will be a slow grind all the way back to what life was like pre-March 2020."
23225,"In that gameplan, we will have gotten used to hearing vaccine numbers rising and restrictions lowering and lowering to the point where we‚Äôre finally living life like normal."
23226,"True, the anti-anything crowd would hate having yet another lockdown, but if we all agree to it, it may be the last one we have to do for another 100 years if our pandemic patterns hold."
23227,Perhaps some areas can join in on bullet two if cases in that area aren‚Äôt as bad so that we can have an illusion of this working nationally (in the states).

23246,The only acceptable policies are those that keep R below 1.
23247,The absolute number of cases matters little compare to whether there numbers is increasing per decreasing.
23248,"If they are increasing, something needs to be done immediately."
23249,"We can try different strategies to reduce the collateral impacts, but if they aren't letting R&lt;1.0, they aren't the right strategies."
23250,It works be so much easier to keep numbers close to zero than to let it spread out of control before responding.
23251,Everyone should be able to know the actual risk associated with the actions they want to take.
23252,Then they can make an informed decision.

23267,No guidance on federal or state websites.
23268,Literally had to talk with other medical practices to track down an obscure form hidden on an obscure page of our regional health department‚Äôs website.

23272,"Fine, fuck em, if they don't want their dose I sure as hell will take it I've been waiting months for this vaccine so I can finally leave my house to go to work and school without having to worry about killing my family."
23273,Interesting.
23274,"So first you say this:

&gt;The British knew of the new covid strain that is more contagious in September, and waiting until December to announce it to the world."
23275,I doubt they care if the 1-shot vaccine led to new variant and vaccine resistance if they can go to the pub to get a drink.
23276,"But now you contradict that sentiment by saying this this:

&gt;I believe that a country's medical authority needs to collect sufficient data and verify it before making an official declaration to prevent a panic."
23277,How do you explain that?
23278,"I‚Äôm basing my opinion on the fact that survival rates are (most often, depending on the criteria of the study) skewed by people who are saved just to essentially be a living corpse."
23279,Those are the ones who make those survival rates look higher than they should be.
23280,"And I‚Äôm open to being proven wrong, I‚Äôve just seen way too many of these cases be discharged from the hospital right to a nursing home where they spent the rest of their ‚Äúlife‚Äù on a ventilator never speaking, interacting or in some cases even opening their eyes ever again."
23281,It‚Äôs a touchy subject for me in that I seriously feel like we‚Äôre doing more damage to these people and their families.

23293,"Seriously, why should vaccination clinics act as if they can store the vaccine for weeks."
23294,No vaccine should be on the shelf for longer than a week.
23295,Right now we just need to get the vaccines in humans instead of freezers.
23296,They do no good in freezers.
23297,"The more of these things that are given out, the better is for everyone everywhere."
23298,It's just logistically easier to vaccinate people in more dense areas first.
23299,Which should in time ease the burden on healthcare in that area.
23300,Which means out of town transfers like that would be getting a better quality of care too.

23330,Deaths under 40 are rare and knowing a few would be quite the anomaly.
23331,You wish.
23332,[deleted]
23333,"I think this is the solution, start breaking freezers, it seems to be the only way to light a fire under the people hoarding the vaccine."
23334,Honestly even if 5-10% were lost in the process it would be better than have 70% sit idle.
23335,"Obviously this is a joke, but it makes me so infuriated when people act as if the only time we can act with urgency is is something bad will happen in the next 10 minutes."
23336,Vaccinating someone now doesn't produce that kind of benefit but it does in 2-4 weeks and beyond.
23337,&gt; Physically force it on them.
23338,Dont care.
23339,People like to rationalize morals and ethics.
23340,No time for that.
23341,That's fucked up.
23342,No time for morals and ethics?
23343,"Yeah, fuck you."
23344,"Well expect it at this point new strain, Trump doing nothing for another 3 weeks, and Antivaxxers everywhere."
23345,Goodnight America it is over the dollar is done no more petro-priviledge from the dollar.
23346,America has become a nation of whiners and the world is not kind to people like that
23347,I am not sure!
23348,"It was a rural location and crazy lucky that ambulance was available at the facility where this happened, so I do know they were on scene pretty much immediately which I'm sure made a big difference."
23349,I had known we were lucky to have him back totally fine (after a few weeks in the hospital) but don't think I knew just how lucky until reading the EMS replies here.
23350,1 in 40 coming soon.
23351,"&gt;As a non American, I am always thrown by headlines like this."
23352,Why focus on veterinarians?
23353,"Takes me a moment to re-think, every time

Like India, the USA has a caste system."
23354,"This is one of the castes, but also tied to our perpetual conflict that forms the backbone of *modern* society and is a rite of passage for many."
23355,"It‚Äôs the narrative, it‚Äôs quite annoying at this point and we wonder why people have grown dismissive of the news"
23356,Meanwhile fauci said a while back that it needed to be 10ft+
23357,&gt; However if a hospital is packed to the brim and unable to treat patients the death toll will soar.
23358,Parts of CA already short on oxygen.
23359,Yeah.
23360,I‚Äôve been doing curbside only since March.
23361,I can‚Äôt wait until this is over and I can pick my own produce again.
23362,You put on the Web site the wait times and the amount of doses available.
23363,"Distribution should be at indoor sporting arenas, not hospitals or clinics."
23364,An indoor sporting arena (none of which are being used right now) has ample parking and enough space to socially distance people.
23365,People are essentially herded through in a line.
23366,Shots are given down on the floor (where they play the sports) and then people move into the bleacher area.
23367,People vaccinated at the same time stay in the same area in the bleachers.
23368,"After 15 minutes of the last person moving into the section has elapsed, they announce on the big overhead TV/board/replay thing that that section is now free to leave."
23369,"Since all of those people came in at the same time, they will all be parked in the same area of the partking lot and will all leave together."
23370,You run this operation 24/7 until all available doses are used up.
23371,You continuously update the website about doses available and wait times.
23372,"Anyway, this is what I would do."
23373,After this I would move out to community colleges and then national guard and reserve centers.
23374,The Army times also reported on this.
23375,The crazy comments under he thread are terrible and embarrassing.
23376,"Comments like..‚ÄùDied with COVID 19 not from COVID 19‚Äù


It‚Äôs horrible."
23377,What do you think will change their minds?
23378,Hospitals are already collapsing it seems.
23379,I've seen so many articles about this.
23380,"https://khn.org/news/surging-health-care-worker-quarantines-raise-concerns-as-coronavirus-spreads/

&gt;In Vacaville, California, alone, one case ‚Äî the first documented instance of community transmission in the U.S. ‚Äî left more than 200 hospital workers under quarantine and unable to work for weeks."
23381,that's why i said reduced lol
23382,I see.
23383,Thanks!
23384,I've never been to a medical facility that was in a hurry to do anything.
23385,Got a cut?
23386,Wait 3 hours for them to super glue it that takes 20 minutes.
23387,And that was at an empty new hospital near my home before Covid.
23388,Too much red tape and lack of urgency.
23389,Bad management focused on dollars not health care.
23390,I'm surprised there is not more criticism of lockdowns from those on the left.
23391,The pandemic response has resulted a massive upward wealth transfer.
23392,"More income inequality and closer to monopoly power for mega corporations is bad, right?"
23393,Is there any country considering targeting vaccination where the new more contagious variants are ?
23394,"I don't expect that the US would do it, but I wonder if we could prevent the contagious variants from becoming widespread if we did."
23395,That makes sense.
23396,Thanks!
23397,We have no idea how many serious reactions occurred.
23398,Adverse reactions don't occur within minutes.
23399,The claim that observing people for 15 minutes post injection isn't supported from the trials.
23400,"Median onset was 1 day, which is anywhere from 0-2 days."
23401,"Not that it matters, you don't see people being held for observation in these vaccine lines anyway, do you?"
23402,I sure don't.
23403,"The media portrayals include receiving the shot and then looking at the camera with a smile and saying, ""see, it's safe!"""
23404,"When my children go into their allergist for challenge tests, under clinical supervision, the doctor is clear we have to observe them for the next 24 hours."
23405,"They prescribe two epis for each of my kids because ""one sometimes isn't enough"" and, if you haven't dealt with allergies, you should know that even after getting an epi injection we're still instructed to go to an ER immediately."
23406,"If you are a patient who receives the vaccine and have an adverse reaction, and you live more than half an hour away from a trauma center, your chances of recovery are diminished."
23407,We have no safety data on this vaccine in regards to allergies because it wasn't even tested--the study explicitly excluded them because they didn't want to burden the participants *and* the vaccine makers argued it was never meant to be deployed population wide (that was a CDC decision).
23408,This is why i cant post these articles on social media.
23409,This ignorance kills me inside
23410,old people don‚Äôt use or understand computers that well.
23411,https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.heraldtribune.com/amp/4098005001
23412,"Provide the seniors with free or heavily discounted meal delivery, in home doctor visits and regular welfare checkups for start."
23413,Locking everything down and killing businesses while funneling people into the arms of amazon and Walmart is about the dumbest solution to this.
23414,Don‚Äôt get me started on curfews and reduced store hours which just concentrate more people together
23415,"Yes our November lockdown was rumoured to be in the pipeline much earlier, since September in fact."
23416,Plus because it only lasted a month didn't have anywhere near the impact of the first lockdown and any good it did has been undone with the new strain and Christmas mixing
23417,What if you catch COVID shortly after getting the vaccine?
23418,Maybe it‚Äôs better to slow to rollout so it doesn‚Äôt gain resistance to antibiotics
23419,"We have vaccines that are not being used at this point, people declining and vaccines that are wasted."
23420,If we should learn something from 2020 it's that consistent messaging is important.
23421,We have competing problems of more vaccines than people offered are willing to take and not enough vaccines to get a high rate of vaccination immediately in the general population.
23422,These aren't ideal conditions and we've learned that half-assing anything is not gonna work.
23423,Do something and do it correctly; two-dose regimen as studied originally by the manufacturers and FDA...otherwise the 5G chips won't full work--lol (I'm joking about this last sentence to be clear).
23424,"If you don't get the measles because you are vaccinated, then you don't spread measles."
23425,No shit...
23426,a huge part is that 30 to 40% of frontline &amp; middle line medical professionals are opting out.
23427,"They didn't expect that, and don't know whether they should give them additional days to change their mind."
23428,But the Surgeon General just announced that these reluctant cohorts only get one chance and then they lose their place in line.
23429,Another huge problem here in SoCal is that private nursing homes are dragging their feet on vaccinating because they don't want to spend additional $$ on nurses for this task.
23430,It was the exact same way when the state required them to do routine covid screenings for their residents.
23431,It literally took weeks for them to comply.
23432,closer to covid+ :p
23433,Only 55% of them went for Trump according to exit polls.
23434,"Lol "" extreme precautions"" it doesn't matter how you change the words, a lot of people just don't care."
23435,The icing on the cake?
23436,"Many City, town, county officials don't care either"
23437,"Interesting, thanks!"
23438,Nurses are disproportionately anti vax
23439,"So just a first come, first serve?"
23440,They should still limit it to front line workers and first responders.
23441,I don't feel like waiting 8 hours behind white collar work from homers to get turned away.
23442,Still not understanding the purpose of curfews.
23443,"People that intended to gather, are just going to gather earlier."
23444,Germany had a curfew for new years eve.
23445,"People just gathered earlier, and then slept over at the place of the gathering (i.e., someone's home), which is probably not a great thing in terms of viral spread."
23446,Brain fog is extremely distressing.
23447,I hope with time your heath improves.
23448,ü§û
23449,"In Canada, Sweden, the UK and elsewhere nursing home residents account for 75+ percent of deaths."
23450,I'm surprised at the low fraction being reported by the US.
23451,It makes me question their accuracy.
23452,[removed]
23453,Should we be calling these mass vaccination centers when they‚Äôll be giving 1000 vaccines a day?
23454,"The idea is great, but 1000 a day doesn‚Äôt seem very high."
23455,We could call them supplementary vaccine centers.
23456,News outlets are getting desperate with these articles.
23457,"COVID is obviously a terrible virus, but comparing war casualties to medical illness deaths is kind of insulting."
23458,It‚Äôs not earth shattering to hear that a global pandemic has taken more lives than a couple of wars.
23459,Are we going to start comparing it to automobile deaths next?
23460,"Please, just stop."
23461,Outdoor vaccination sites won't work in Northern parts of the country where it's below freezing.
23462,Weather is a factor and trying to get this implemented outside in December - April freezing temps in the Midwest isn't feasible.
23463,The license does not come before a person‚Äôs well being.
23464,The license is contingent on nurses and pharms NOT being mindless pill dispensers who actually THINK about what they are administering to patients.
23465,One pharm on a power trip doesn‚Äôt change that.
23466,"Every person on the chain including doctors can and do overlook things and make mistakes and that‚Äôs why, once again, the role of a pharm or RN is not just ‚Äúread the order, give the pill‚Äù."
23467,"4.84

https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations"
23468,The virus goes away eventually but police will still be here?
23469,And people only went out this year despite the virus because many were finally not beholden to their strict work/job life and able to pay attention to the social issues.
23470,Also people were pushed to the breaking point by a particularly heinous murder of an innocent man by the police not to mention the economic struggles many people have found themselves in.
23471,"Also many BLM protestors were wearing masks and believe in the science of covid

Reminder originally this was about the hypocrisy of the right/anti maskers not wanting to wear masks yet hero worship vets while essentially committing manslaughter via virus on them and all of their fellow countrymen by ignoring the science and health regulations

It‚Äôs not really the same is it"

23481,I was there.
23482,Everything I've read and been told said there was a little over 800 doses total.

23486,Good.
23487,Use literally anything that makes the process easier instead of sitting around wondering how to get excess stock of vaccines out.
23488,The process so far has been an absolute joke and it‚Äôs an even bigger joke when you realize if we just made it universally available to any senior or at-risk person the death toll would plummet.
23489,This is doable.
23490,More than the rest of Europe combined.

23502,"(A perfectly valid stategy which usually results in stronger and.more durable immunity) which again, you also know because I‚Äôve linked that to you."
23503,"Meaning it‚Äôs not going to be ‚Äúuntested science‚Äù ..

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not going to be untested science‚Äù is a direct acknowledgment that currently, mixed dosing regimens *are* untested science because those studies aren‚Äôt done yet."
23504,I‚Äôm all for gathering more data and being more aggressive about our immunization strategies once we have clinical trial results.
23505,It‚Äôs just irresponsible to apply those regimens to the general public *before you have actually done the studies*.

23524,We filled out paperwork and were also given a vaccination card.
23525,The staff said they would be contacting us to come in for the second shot.
23526,But isn‚Äôt the only reason there is a bottleneck is because they are restricting who can get it.

23548,"In *some parts* of Africa, they are (or have been); in others instead they have not been affected."
23549,Can deaths go unaccounted for?
23550,"Undoubtedly - data on mortality shows that this is the case for most badly affected countries in the world, including countries with a far greater testing capacity - no offense - than any African country."
23551,"And there is evidence of undercounting in some African countries, I mentioned it earlier."
23552,I do not claim to be an expert just because I have been reading a bit on the matter.
23553,"Likewise, just being a Nigerian does not make you an expert on the covid situation across the entire continent."
23554,Or across all of Nigeria for that matter - it was Nigerian officials who ascertained what happened in Kano.
23555,Do you deny that outbreak?
23556,No incentives to hide covid numbers on part of the governments?
23557,That sounds quite naive.
23558,"Having few victims, and therefore having done a goid job at containing the outbreak, makes them look good both internally (well, except in regions that have been badly affected, of course) and internationally."

23572,why tf do they float these huge numbers.

23576,I‚Äôve been wondering about that while watching this vaccine rollout.
23577,Things seem so unorganized which makes me think your scenario could become a reality.
23578,Although I did see on the news the other day they were thinking of giving half doses to people to get the vaccine to more of the population.
23579,I can‚Äôt remember for sure but I think they were talking about not bothering with a second dose.
23580,"I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs a good idea, but I do interpret that to mean they think it will be ok if a second dose is delayed or even completely skipped."
23581,Okay thanks for clearing that up
23582,It didn‚Äôt help that Trump held a rally in Whitfield County Georgia.
23583,That county has been the hardest hit in the state

23605,I would be inclined to agree if the fatality of this virus wasn't exponentially related to the age of the victim.
23606,I'm at work or I'd link the page but per the CDC you've got the vast majority of deaths occuring in people above the age of 65.
23607,"So in practicality if you vaccinate those above the age of 65, even though it might be drastically less than 80% of the population, you'll successfully mitigate potentially more than 80% of the damage."
23608,You might be willing to write this fact off but as someone who has spent the past decade of their life working with numbers in graduate school and industry I can assure you that ignoring the fact that there's nuance in the numbers is a massive blunder.
23609,"And you might say ""but cases""."
23610,First of all the measurement/process noise with PCR testing is far too much too ignore.
23611,The case number should be taken with a grain of salt in either direction - there could be far more cases or far less - the point is that the number is basically arbitrary.
23612,"Deaths are absolute, and the science tells where those deaths occur."
23613,"Vaccinate those people and you mitigate damage, simple as that."
23614,That should be the number one concern.
23615,"I strongly believe that this is not a matter of ""80% of people with vaccine = 80% less damage"" but rather an example of the pareto principal where 20% effort yields 80% returns, diminishing past that point."
23616,If zero-cases is the goal however then sure 80% vaccination = 80% of people immune but it's nothing short of hubris to think that we can just and eradicate a virus.
23617,That isn't going to happen.
23618,"You bring down deaths, you target those to whom the virus is fatal, then worry about those to whom the virus is an inconvenience (and yes, those people exist)"
23619,Don't want it?

23667,Some RNs I know who work exclusively in telehealth have declined for this reason.

23775,If some cells managed to integrate the spike (not possible) - those are the only cells that would be attacked.

23916,We have 21 days of data on single doses being up to 85% effective for both Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.
23917,The reason they went with a double dose with the mRNA vaccines is that they were brand new technology and they wanted to make sure that we'd have full effectiveness.

23924,"I thought the hypocrisy was pretty blatant before, didn't really think it could become this blindingly obvious."
23925,"Yup, agree big time."
23926,I‚Äôm a big advocate of vaccines and restrictions until vaccines are widely rolled out.
23927,"But at some point, we have to say we‚Äôre not living in fear anymore."
23928,"*If* we are to see mutations that aren‚Äôt in any way effective, I doubt it‚Äôs any governments okay to just continue like we are right now every time there‚Äôs a mutation."
23929,"I know it *seems* like governments are loving the state of the obedient public right now, but governments are pragmatic and understand that this is not the most efficient way forward, rolling lockdowns and restrictions and what not."
23930,"I would hope that if it becomes apparent that we are going to see new mutations every few months, governing bodies around the world *would* just say it‚Äôs time to let nature do its thing."
23931,"However I am of the hope that vaccines will still provide *some* protection, similar to the protection we have against new flu strains every season."
23932,"Hopefully after we‚Äôve all been vaccinated we can ‚Äòlet it rip‚Äô around the semi-protected population, and some will die, but most would live."
23933,"Some would be hospitalized, but most would be bed ridden for a week with soup and lots of water."
23934,"Hopefully we‚Äôll just have a really bad flu introduced into our public that still kills tens of thousands of people, but isn‚Äôt enough for your average person to avoid all gatherings and wear a mask in public for life."

23936,I wish it was that easy to isolate my grandparents who are both over 80.
23937,"They still go to the store, have multiple in-person doctors appts (most of which could be done remotely), and go to church at least once a week."
23938,"They know the virus is real, but also think wearing a mask, and staying their distance from people will be enough."
23939,There is no getting through to them.
23940,Oh that I believe.
23941,But oxygen is not hard to manufacture the way N95s are.
23942,Someone along the way dropped the ball.
23943,What am I being unrealistic about?
23944,My 14M shots in arms in 2-3 weeks?
23945,Here's what I've seen:  A very clear and deliberate ramping up of vaccinations.
23946,"It took us 10 days to do the first million, 6 days for the second million, 4 days for the third million, and 2 days for the 4th million."
23947,"I imagine you saw that ""glimmer of hope"" Fauci quote on the front page here about 1.5M doses in 3 days."
23948,We're already at 500k doses per day.
23949,"Getting out the 10M doses (Yes, I said 14M."
23950,"That's the total number, yes, I was playing fast and loose with the numbers, I know, but states can't do 14M additional doses today, they can only do 10M so let's adjust to that number) currently sitting on the shelves over the next 2-3 weeks is nearly a certainty as we are already at that rate."
23951,(And will likely continue to ramp up speed.)
23952,We also have the big boon of now being able to deliver 2nd doses.
23953,I imagine quite a few states were sitting on doses for that purpose because they didn't trust the feds to deliver them when they said they were going to based on them botching their 2nd week delivery numbers and missing the 20M by end of year goal.
23954,Exactly.
23955,Especially for the ‚Äúpro-vet‚Äù party.
23956,If this is how we treat the first responders how many are going to keep signing up?
23957,That goes for teachers and health care workers as well but unfortunately those lives don‚Äôt seem to matter as much to the pro-life party.
23958,Sadly I lost all hope for republicans to care about vet lives after they accepted the ‚Äúthis is what they signed up for‚Äù line.
23959,Just horrible.

23963,"&gt;the backlash to Stanford vaccinating administrators

What kind of ""backlash"" was there?"
23964,&gt;Cuomo is literally threatening to send hospital workers to jail if they vaccinate the wrong people.
23965,On what authority?
23966,That means you have a conscience.
23967,Let it be your guide.
23968,"Even if it's a small risk (and I'm not sure it's small), the downside could easily be catastrophic."
23969,"If you're lucky enough to see him struggling to breathe on a respirator, do you want to tell him it's because you just wanted to see him that time?"
23970,Just visit with him by Zoom or FaceTime until things get safer.
23971,"It could be a while, but I bet you'd rather be able to give him a hug when it's over."
23972,People won't be mentally capable of reporting what their O2 level is even if they have an oximeter before the medics get there.
23973,"If it's bad enough to call an ambulance, they're panicking."
23974,"Many people live alone, or the family is panicking."
23975,Hypoxia sets in and patients turn bluish and use all their energy to breathe.
23976,"They may have a co-occurring health problem like heart problems, or COPD on top of Covid and pneumonia, or be too out of it from days of respiratory distress."
23977,Im beyond baffled that the idea of the US military locking people in their homes is even on the table for some people.
23978,That's not the reality you want.
23979,[removed]
23980,Its my choice
23981,"They did and that was wrong, but way too many people on Reddit just constantly trash the US based on false assumptions about what is being done."
23982,It's incredibly prevalent recently with the stimulus checks where everyone is just ignoring the increased unemployment checks and acting like unemployed people are only being given $600 when really they are being given that much every week.
23983,"The actual stimulus checks aren't even intended to help individuals, they are fiscal stimulus intended to help generate economic growth."
23984,-Putin offers up 100K bounties to the Taliban for each American soldier they kill.
23985,Donald says absolutely nothing.
23986,"-Covid is killing vets at an alarming rate, exceeding the rates killed in Iraq/Afganistan."
23987,Donald says nothing.
23988,"-Donald calls people killed in the war, ""suckers and losers."""
23989,But he and other Republicans *definitely* care about the troops.
23990,You could get antigen tested.
23991,"It's not 100% accurate, and may cross react to other coronaviruses, but it's at least better than nothing."
23992,This is what is absolutely boggling my mind.
23993,"I mean, I get that it's a difficult problem, but we should have had a dedicated well funded task force that was tackling this problem (and only this problem) for the last 9 months."
23994,"We knew a vaccine was coming, and that we would need to administer it."
23995,How come it seems like we're only now trying to figure out distribution?
23996,"The way I see it you had 5 separate problems to solve, that should have had dedicated people solving them

1) Develop a vaccine - This one was for the science nerds, and they seemed to have come through well

2) Approve/validate the vaccine - Government administrators, basically while the vaccine was being developed, ensure that your process was streamlined (not in an unsafe way, just remove unecessary steps and delays, and ensure everyone is primed to have it top of list)."
23997,"This seems to have worked relatively well

3) Manufacturing - Once the vaccine is developed, how do we pump a shit ton of it out the door quickly?"
23998,"Get all manufacturers lined up ready to go, setting up production lines, getting a head start, etc."
23999,"This seems to be working relatively well, but I'm really not sure what the ceiling is here for production capabilities, so I don't know if we're hitting our theoretical limit."
24000,"4) Logistics - Once it's created, how do we get it to the places that will use it?"
24001,"Not sure if the problem is here, but it seems to be a pretty easy problem to solve given the logistical complexity of our current world, so if they is an issue, someone dropped the ball fucking HARD."
24002,5) Administration - This one seems to have really been dropped.
24003,How do we get the vaccine that is currently in our hands into people's arms?
24004,"Now  this is a relatively complex problem, but with 9 months of people dedicated to it, I can't say it's remotely unsolvable."
24005,"Come up with priority lists, figure out who/what/where is the administration of the vaccine happening, line up boots on the ground everywhere to get things organized, community outreach, etc."
24006,"I don't know, it just feels like we're really not firing on all cylinders here and it's frustrating."
24007,"Not only because of the death toll, but the impact to the economy etc should have given PLENTY of motive to throw virtually unlimited resources at this problem."
24008,Step 1: We invade your country.
24009,"Step 2: 20 years later, we make movies about how invading your country made our soldiers sad."
24010,The problem with any test like this is ignorance.
24011,"Many people would sniff the card and then go about their business because ""they were tested."""
24012,"And then you have the crowd who would sniff, not smell, and say ""I feel fine so I'll keep an eye out"" then go see family at the restaurant."
24013,These types of tests have to come with a huge asterisk.
24014,"&gt; With vaccines that require this degree of refrigeration to remain effective, picking and choosing was always going to cause this."
24015,This is not true.
24016,Storage isn't an issue.
24017,EVERY SINGLE major grocery store with a pharmacy in my area has a dry ice freezer sitting up front.
24018,Dry ice temp is the correct storage temp for these vaccines.
24019,I get flu shots at the pharmacy all the time.
24020,There was zero plan at the national level to get shots into arms.
24021,The Federal gov just dumped it down to the states to figure out.
24022,The DPH's at the state level lack funding and have been spending for 9 months straight now on the pandemic.
24023,Interesting discussion!
24024,"The current vaccines on the market do not contain pork, they are concerned that the one in the approval process could."
24025,"Both orthodox Jewish and muslim scholars are confident, that it is ok to take a vaccine which includes pork."
24026,"I think it is important to discuss those problems  beforehand, to increase the willingness to be vaccinated in religious people!"
24027,"Masks leak too, the fact that it‚Äôs not hermetic is not enough to establish this one particular person as the cause."
24028,People leak air by default.
24029,It‚Äôs kinda how the virus spreads.
24030,"In fact, I would hypothesize that the suit would actually cause the larger (non aerosol) droplets to fall out of suspension, due to rapid changes in velocity (fast air goes in, recirculates, stagnates, and then leaks out through the semipermeable fabric)."
24031,"Instead of spreading it to everyone, I‚Äôd expect the inside of that suit to be a veritable cornucopia of viral stew (not spew, stew."
24032,A watery chunky stew of spew) that would have otherwise been in the room.
24033,Dude basically put himself inside a dyson.
24034,"I‚Äôm amazed he‚Äôs not dead

Disclaimer: don‚Äôt know shit about virology, know a lot more about fluid dynamics"
24035,Survivor bias
24036,&gt; This is one common excuse among anti vaxxers but it is totally ridiculous.
24037,"Perhaps, but planning a vaccine rollout and not taking into selfishness into consideration is also totally ridiculous."
24038,"Again, back to messaging -perhaps be honest and extremely up front in pro vaccine ads and say, ‚Äúif you are young and healthy we need you to get this vaccine not for your own health but to protect those vulnerable around you, it‚Äôs the only way we can get back to normal quickly!‚Äù Or similar."
24039,"My overall point is acknowledge and address the concerns, don‚Äôt just dismiss them as ‚Äúanti-science‚Äù."
24040,"HIV wasn't the supervirus the fascists were hoping for, but they definitely tried with it."
24041,The AIDS crisis was a democide.

24044,"&gt; slick ad campaigns

The problem is, those are already used, but by anti-vaxx and those with vested interest in disrupting the health / stability of the US."
24045,&gt; I‚Äôm gonna assume it‚Äôs the same entity that will Be clawing the vaccine back if unused.
24046,"They better get their asses in gear, because clawing back a bunch of expired (or soon to be expired) vaccine isn't very useful."
24047,"Because the Afghanistan and Iraq wars were extremely safe for the deployed troops, relative to any other war."
24048,I know this will sound like some nonsense conspiracy theory and I'm certainly not a virologist or a scientist of any kind.
24049,But a virus that is mutating like this strain in SA doesn't seem to be one nature-made.
24050,It just seems like such a smart virus - almost a biological weapon type.
24051,Again not spewing conspiracy theories but just a thought.
24052,Also - if you have access to the vaccine GET IT!
24053,They linked to the wrong memo.

24057,Can you provide source on that?
24058,Are there commercials on Youtube or something?
24059,&gt; if you fire everyone who doesn't want the vaccine you can't take care of patients.
24060,Staffing is bad as it is.
24061,"The point is to get them vaccinated, not to fire them."
24062,It's pressure.
24063,Right.
24064,We can do nothing to prevent that.
24065,Yeah got paid 700K a week to stay at home and play video games.
24066,T'was awesome.
24067,Wish the lockdown lasted longer.
24068,Everyone went out and blew their govt money after the lockdown ended so a lot of the money got put back into the economy.

24070,"What's the point in ""deaths by report date"" ?"
24071,Your psychoanalytic attempt is laughable.
24072,Take care
24073,&gt; And I remember: No one wants to kill me.
24074,Yes they do.
24075,"They're called Trumpists now, and they have no intention of being satisfied with limiting themselves to Jews."
24076,They want EVERYONE NOT THEMSELVES killed.
24077,That and violent stupidity are why they picked a virus as their weapon.
24078,You can‚Äôt get bottled oxygen in SoCal right now.
24079,My neighbor was discharged from the hospital with orders to be on oxygen at home.
24080,"It‚Äôs been two days and he still can‚Äôt find anyone to deliver any, they are simply out."
24081,Misleading headline.
24082,"i dont think they said half doses, just half of the available doses to go elsewhere"
24083,"Probably, both roles are in [Tier 3](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/CDPH-Allocation-Guidelines-for-COVID-19-Vaccine-During-Phase-1A-Recommendations.aspx)."
24084,Well the Feds made recommendations and then the states decide whether or not to adopt them.
24085,"They are well intentioned, but causing problems."
24086,California is a good example.
24087,They have a very low vaccine usage rate and some are blaming it on the backlash to Stanford vaccinating administrators.
24088,Now other hospitals are scared of a similar backlash if they don't follow the rules to the letter.
24089,New York is another example.
24090,Cuomo is literally threatening to send hospital workers to jail if they vaccinate the wrong people.
24091,"Well, according to my back of the envelope calculations, if we didn't burn down the entire rainforest, which is the lungs of the planet, we wouldn't have an oxygen shortage that has killed more children than all the star wars combined /s"
24092,We would go mainly in-store for their water but it's not worth it now.
24093,We just bought a TV from there and their warranty is unbeatable.
24094,They gave us a full refund on our last TV 3 years later after the manufacturer's was up.
24095,Still worth it to us but we miss some of the in-store only deals.
24096,Not now religion

24116,I really wish mythbusters would do a reunion/special to do an update on the covering your sneeze/cough episode where they tested covering your sneeze with your hand vs your elbow vs not covering at all and do one wearing different types of masks to show how effective they are at stopped the blue dyed droplets from spreading.

24141,I read today that in LA county (where there are **zero ICU beds available!!!

24143,"This isn't fear mongering/fear articles, it's the dark and sad truth."
24144,"Not to take a dig or anything, genuine curiosity- I wonder if sars-cov-2 is seen as Haram (opp of Halal, being transmitted from wild animals) and if that means choose better of the two amongst the virus and vaccine."

24152,"It‚Äôs two different variants, we all agree about that apparently, I don‚Äôt really understand the confusion here?"

24168,How much longer where they going to live?
24169,But ok lets compare it to stats of people in their 20's or 30s who died in wars.
24170,This is just dumb.
24171,Doesnt make sense.
24172,"&gt;My sister is in a hospital in a pretty ~~COLOR DENOTING PARTY~~ county in Illinois, about half of them opted to get the vaccine, including my sister."
24173,It really is going to depend on the state.
24174,It looks like Illinois is likely about done with their medical workers portion of the vaccine.
24175,"They've claimed at least 269,000 medical workers have been vaccinated, that was about a week ago."
24176,"I know the goal was short of 500,000."
24177,"I'm part of a non-essential, non-frontline, non-medical worker that's 35."
24178,So I'm in the last group of people it's available to.
24179,"I'm willing and even excited to get it, it's frustrating to see people turn it down."

24181,Agreed but there‚Äôs a majority of us that aren‚Äôt anti-Vaxxers... we‚Äôre already underpaid just give us the opportunity to keep ourselves and loved ones safe.
24182,I would think the only reason that is the case is because the Trump regime didn't take any planning actions but just pushed it to the states.
24183,When were states told that they need to plan for distribution?
24184,In a pandemic you need a central coordination.

Again, that's not lying."
24207,That's adjusting your conclusions based on what info is being presented.
24208,Bottom line he just wants you to get vaccinated.
24209,So just do it if you can.
24210,"The article even opens up to say, there's no way to know until we know."
24211,I'm in that boat.
24212,The virus can infect you from frozen food products.
24213,There‚Äôs zero way to 100% guarantee you won‚Äôt get sick.

24221,"Sure you wore a mask, and washed your hands, but covid traveled with you."
24222,You don't know who you may have infected by carrying the virus on your person.

24232,Hello.
24233,I am trying to get more statistics on second occurrences of COVID.
24234,"Since the beginning of the second waves in most countries, I have a feeling or at least the perception that nobody is keeping track of how many patients are at their second diagnosis."
24235,I have read the recommendations on the FAQs about vaccines in case of people already  infected.
24236,"I am trying to understand if the risks associated with a possible second infection - already had COVID in March of last year - are higher or lower than the possible risks, consequences and unknown long term effects of the vaccine."
24237,Thanks everyone and be safe.
24238,"Here it is, folks."
24239,"You couldn't stay away from family for just one year and decided ""It's okay,"" to travel, now we see the fallout."

24242,That's what we're doing in Texas.
24243,We have a lot of demand and are not giving it out fast enough.
24244,Sadly there dosen't seem to be a good distribution plan in place yet.

24246,"Tiresome discussion now, I can rephrase it then."
24247,"It is not an intellectually honest and reasonable comparison, but if you want to make a hyperbolic point based on your feelings and political views then yes the comparison can be made"
24248,"Yes, just pointing out the stupidity of this article."
24249,As you age you are more at risk to any physiological disease.
24250,lmao
24251,The chronic disease community is full of these stories.
24252,Mono is a big one that causes issues.
24253,Usually these ppl have been considered crazy by the medical industry (fibro and CFS have been called fake by many).
24254,Truth lies in the middle - many are real.
24255,There is nothing particularly special about long Covid.
24256,Thanks.
24257,I'm curious what the velocity looks like for non-employee group 1A vaccinations in your geography.
24258,How much incentive do the hospitals really have to put in the work on bringing in outside professionals to vaccinate them?
24259,"I assume the comp, if anything, is so bad that on straight commercial terms you'd just go ""ehh, no thanks""."
24260,Cops don‚Äôt deserve it.
24261,"I obviously don't know for sure either, but it seems like this article is saying that they don't think the mutation will entirely negate the vaccine."
24262,"I think much of the worry is that the vaccine will be less effective on the South Africa strain, but not necessarily ineffective entirely."

24265,That's not accurate.

24292,A lot of people were crippled or killed.
24293,That‚Äôs still in living memory.

Nope."
24407,"90.5% is the overall efficacy for the whole period of 7 days following dose 2, not a snapshot taken on 7 days after dose 2."
24408,"Just like 52.4% is the overall efficacy for a period encompassing all 21 days between both doses, not a snapshot of the efficacy attained right before the second dose on day 21."
24409,We know exactly how many SAEs occurred because it's publicly available information at this point.
24410,You never answered the question: why are they not comparable?
24411,Let's be clear here: there were no tests during the trials to determine whether people who were vaccinated contracted the disease.
24412,They only observed symptoms.
24413,The prevalence numbers are derived from comparing the people who had acute symptoms who were vaccinated against those who had acute symptoms who were unvaccinated.
24414,They did not compare people who were vaccinated with symptoms against people who were vaccinated without symptoms.
24415,"We have no data, *nothing*, in those data regarding how many people were vaccinated, got COVID, but exhibited no symptoms."
24416,They didn't conduct PCR on the study participation.
24417,They relied on participating to report their symptoms.
24418,This isn't like your example.
24419,"Vaccinated people can walk around with COVID in their bodies, they can potentially transmit it to others, but since they don't have any symptoms at all we would never know they are even spreading it."
24420,That's the seriousness of the issue with or without vaccinations.

24433,Those are absolutely not the most at risk people.
24434,"The most at risk people are folks over the age of 70, those living in assisted living (nursing homes)."
24435,What about the 60000 test subjects who demonstrated it's safety?
24436,Only people who ignore data would imply it's unsafe.
24437,I personally expect nothing majorly positive until March.
24438,It's just gonna suck for a while.
24439,This.
24440,It's labeled differently because it is different.
24441,"Besides, even if you got a health system to agree to push it as mandatory, the people who quit in protest will do more damage to the public imagine of the vaccine than it is worth."
24442,I would hope some of the world's largest military budget  would go towards vaccines for people who fought for their country.
24443,"But probably just some more missile, planes, and shit."

24456,Moderna vaccine for us.
24457,Expires around March/April - which won't be an issue.
24458,We got a second dose a week after the first.
24459,Expiration date on that is Julyish.
24460,I'm not concerned on expiring drugs bc I'm confident we'll use them all -eventually.
24461,Concern is not saving lives when we have the ability and not keeping people out of the hospital.
24462,"from the article

&gt; The World Health Organisation says China is refusing access to Wuhan to officials investigating the origins of the coronavirus pandemic."
24463,"&gt; Australia led calls for the inquiry which was eventually backed by a global coalition of 137 countries, including China, at a meeting of the World Health Assembly in May."
24464,&gt; But it came amid concerns over Beijing's early cover-up of the virus and the role the WHO played in alerting the world to the public health crisis.
24465,"And Australia's demands for the investigation are, in part, blamed for the deterioration in the Australia-China relationship, with China cutting off billions of dollars worth of trade in retaliation."
24466,"&gt; World Health Organisation Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said two members of the investigative team had already left their home countries for Wuhan, as agreed in advance with China, when it became clear that Beijing had not issued the necessary permission for the team to enter the country."
24467,"&gt; ""I'm very disappointed with this news given that two members had already begun their journey and others were not able to travel at the last minute,"" he told a news conference in Geneva."
24468,"...

&gt; Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he had been ""assured that China is speeding up the internal procedures for the earliest possible deployment""."
24469,"&gt; But in later questioning, it was not clear when they would be permitted entry."
24470,&gt; Dr Michael Ryan from WHO said the officials were not given visa clearances; one official was sent back home and the other is staying in a third country until China grants entry.
24471,oh for sure.
24472,it just indicates that a death two days after vaccination after jabbing 4 million people is an expected event for no other reason than random chance and the natural death rate.
24473,"I don't understand why you are saying that it is a ""major stretch."""
24474,It seems to be EXACTLY what your quote says.
24475,"But not the cases from the subsequent spread caused by people going home, not to mention New Years."
24476,Well since the statistics also show nurses not taking the vaccine it stops being an anecdote lol

24485,"No, for two reasons:  


1 - Oh my god, that would be chaos."
24486,Keeping a vaccination clinic socially distanced is tricky enough when you have enough doses for everyone who shows up.
24487,"2 - We get far more benefit from focusing on high-risk groups at this point, even if vaccination is slower."
24488,Nursing homes account for half the burden on hospitals.
24489,Healthcare workers catching COVID is it's own burden on the system.
24490,"If you want your hospital system to keep functioning, the best way to ensure that is to get the highest risk groups vaccinated first, even if that process causes some delays."
24491,"I know it's not intuitive to someone who hasn't seen first-hand the demographics of hospitalized COVID patients, but one vaccine given to a nursing home patient is much more likely to save a life than a dozen given to people &lt;50."
24492,Are those the 15 cases left and then it's gone?
24493,Like a miracle?
24494,"I've seen several sets of reported numbers based on different numbers, so ""it depends""."
24495,"With about 350,000 American deaths and a *projected* 100 million people infected, the mortality rate is 0.35%."
24496,Of course the mortality rate is much higher in some populations.

24498,"if your motivation to be a test subject is to just get access to the good stuff, keep in mind that these are blinded trials and they won't be able to tell you if they gave you the real vaccine candidate or a placebo for two years for observation."
24499,You'll be ineligible for any other vaccines if/when they become widely available and odds are 50/50 you'll get no vaccine at all during that time.

24514,"There are 16,866,000 health care workers in the U.S."
24515,"There are 800,000 law enforcement officers in the U.S., or about 21 health care workers per law enforcement officer."
24516,"3000 health care workers have died from Covid-19, and 154 law enforcement officers, or about 19.5 health care workers per law enforcement officer."
24517,End result: law enforcement workers are slightly more likely to die of covid-19 than health care workers.

24519,now they look like incompetent morons?
24520,now...jesus this entire 4 year bullshittery and especially this past year makes America look like we just woke up after getting our wisdom teeth pulled with laughing gas
24521,"With millions of doses sitting unused, does declining a vaccine actually result in another person getting one who otherwise would've had to wait?"
24522,It seems like it would just slow the process of getting vaccines in arms.
24523,"Maybe local conditions are different, and some places have only a limited number of doses available?"
24524,"Man, I never realized how dumb some nurses and medical professionals are."
24525,"Ignoring safety guidelines, refusing the vaccine..."
24526,The sorority sister doesn‚Äôt fall far from the kegger I guess.
24527,"Only conspiracy theorists think that the vaccine is 'deadly poison', and the only people who have been lying this entire pandemic are Trump and his mindless minions."
24528,"&gt;When the coronavirus began spreading through New York, Gov."
24529,"Andrew M. Cuomo ordered state-run hospitals to stop suing patients over unpaid medical bills, and almost all of the major private hospitals in the state voluntarily followed suit by suspending their claims."
24530,"&gt;But one chain of hospitals has plowed ahead with thousands of lawsuits: Northwell Health, which is the state‚Äôs largest health system and is run by one of Mr. Cuomo‚Äôs closest allies."
24531,"&gt;The nonprofit Northwell sued more than 2,500 patients last year, records show, a flood of litigation even as the pandemic has led to widespread job losses and economic uncertainty."
24532,"&gt;The Northwell lawsuits each sought an average of $1,700 in unpaid bills, plus large interest payments."
24533,"They hit teachers, construction workers, grocery store employees and others, including some who had lost work in the pandemic or gotten sick themselves."
24534,No I realistically believed we could hit 3000 in the winter because we had hit like 2000 last Spring.
24535,But pretty soon the deaths are going to peak with vaccinations and end of winter.
24536,You are deluded if you think we are going to have 5000 a day for 30 days straight.
24537,"Agreed- I'm a frontline worker and I got mine yesterday (feeling great FYI, love the 5G!"
24538,:P).
24539,"I didn't think I would get it until the end of the month, since my inpatient unit is not direct admissions."
24540,However we are getting a lot of open spots from other staff declining.
24541,This frustrates me to no end- they have SEEN how horrible this has been for our patients.
24542,"But hey, if they don't want it, keep going, keep vaccinating."
24543,The more the merrier!
24544,Most are too poor to ever get the vaccine this year so they'll have a lot of time to worry about that
24545,Flu mutates much faster than coronavirus.
24546,"To illustrate this, immunity against SARS (a different virus from covid19, but still in the same family) provides partial immunity against covid19."
24547,Any two different variants of covid19 are much more similar to each other than to SARS.
24548,I do believe certain folks should have priority before the general population.
24549,"But since we are finding not everyone is getting it, then we should have either a waitlist or lottery system to fill in empty spots."
24550,Plenty of states are flat in hospitalizations or are on their downward turn.
24551,[Thought this behind the scenes story was an interesting side note to this](https://thewell.northwell.edu/covid/us-covid-vaccine)
24552,"
California, arguably the epicenter of app developers, released their contact tracing app in December... We don't need an app for everything and especially not something that is time sensitive and disproportionately affects people who are famously not tech savvy."
24553,An actual plan for distribution would have been much easier and more cost effective than an app without all the bugs.
24554,"Whether we're talking about half doses or longer intervals, it was ALWAYS a public policy level decision, NOT a scientific one."
24555,"The 28 day interval was chosen because of how quickly we needed a vaccine in service, not because of the medical properties of that number."
24556,I don't like that people see this and immediately think it was an anti-science debate.
24557,There are very good reasons that other countries are doing it and they aren't anti-science countries.
24558,"When people say ""listen to the damn science"", here's some science to listen to:

24559,"I'm all for religious freedom, but it should only so far as no one else is being harmed."
24560,"In this case, if people aren't vaccinated, then that's not okay."
24561,Ex-military or specific branch e.g.
24562,ex-army/navy/RAF) is a phrase I've heard far more than veteran (also in the UK).
24563,"You didn't mention anxiety in your first post - you mentioned immune issues, sensitivity to medications, and fear of side effects."
24564,And this subject is a powderkeg - opinions are forceful on all sides.
24565,"You asked for advice on how to talk your dad out of his request that you don't see him until you get vaccinated when it's available - don't try, because it's important to respect him on this."
24566,And don't lie to him.
24567,"As noted, you can do it by Zoom or FaceTime for the foreseeable future, and you'll be glad about that on the other end."
24568,Ehhh I wouldn‚Äôt take that paper as fact.
24569,It says 1 in 5 at 5 weeks and then 1 in 10 at 12 weeks.
24570,"Plus it was a survey, which comes with its own issues."
24571,"Also, assessing just symptoms is vague."
24572,What symptoms?
24573,How many?
24574,How severe?
24575,The research on Long Covid just isn‚Äôt robust enough yet to draw any meaningful conclusion about its prevalence.
24576,"I know it is real, the question is how prevalent."
24577,I‚Äôd personally want to see a study where all the participants were evaluated by a physician to determine if they have long Covid or not.
24578,I remember when it was Spring or bust.
24579,These folks move their goal post just as much as anyone else.
24580,"What I'm trying to say is that the government is waiting for the wrong vaccine, not that Sanofi's shouldn't be developed but we should get more options sooner especially for older people."
24581,Yeah world really revolves around you right?
24582,That's so rude and disrespectful towards nurses and other healthcare professionals who are literally reaching a breaking point.
24583,"That's absolutely not true that they have nothing to do other than post TikToks, if that's you're getting information about covid then I'm not even surprising you're spewing this insane garbage."
24584,I don't know what this sub would do without Pessimist2020 and Viewfromthe31stfloor  submissions!
24585,We'd probably be missing out on a lot of good material.
24586,"Unfortunately, that's how you get pay to play schemes."
24587,"Half the doses won't go to the general public, and we know it"
24588,&gt; I am giving the vaccines one fair shot.
24589,"If this fails, I am going to do anything in my power to stop the lockdowns."
24590,"i am starting activist groups, organizing ralys and if all that fails, armed rebellion."
24591,"I don't think anyone has tried shooting at the virus yet, you may be on to something."
24592,Because they work in healthcare?
24593,And its a pandemic?
24594,Plenty of places will not keep you on if you dont get the flu shot.
24595,This should be the same.
24596,I would love for her to zoom my students
24597,Get the vaccine out.
24598,No more bullshit.
24599,No vaccine should sit for more than a week.
24600,"Identify the places doing a good job and send them more, open up new sites, roll the vaccine out to pharmacies, run clinic 7 days a week, do it all."
24601,No more excuses.
24602,&gt;That‚Äôs literally all it would have taken.
24603,Hate to be the bearer of bad news but it would have taken a lot more than this.
24604,I am in Canada and our leaders have been pushing masks from almost day 1 and we are still had to add a ton of restrictions.
24605,"Most of our provinces (states) are in full lockdown, masks laws, essential travel only, work from home, restaurants and bars closed,....etc."
24606,"The virus numbers are still going up here, this isn't an easy battle to win."
24607,It is all worth it because we are saving lives and we want to avoid what is happening to our neighbours to the south but to say it is just as easy as a leader not being an idiot is unfortunately not correct.
24608,"This post appears to be about vaccines, please see [our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/wiki/faq#wiki_where_can_i_find_information_about_the_mechanism_and_progress_of_vaccines.3F) for answers to frequently asked questions regarding the COVID-19 vaccines."

24613,"the thing we all feared for so long has never been so transparent, they practically revel in it now."
24614,"I always wondered if ""conservative"" implied monarchy..."
24615,Nope.
24616,It's the lack of a federal response that has put us in this situation.
24617,States aren't equipped to deal with this.
24618,"When disasters/crisis overwhelm local and state resources, the federal government is supposed to step in to help."
24619,The federal government has a lot of say in how states respond.
24620,"It can say, ""All states must have a mask mandate and follow CDC guidelines."
24621,"Any state that fails to comply will not receive federal relief funds."""
24622,(If said funds were passed).
24623,"Money and resources are the primary leverage the federal government can use against states, and it's highly effective."
24624,Operation Warp Speed is a federal level program that was supposed to coordinate things like distribution and tracking.
24625,You can't blame states for poor performance when they aren't getting the required resources to actually follow guidelines.
24626,"There are leadership failures on multiple levels, but it all starts at the top."
24627,So the party in charge gets the blame here right?
24628,"It's not just happening in those three places, it's all over the US."
24629,It is both Trump admin and States.
24630,"The federal government should have been using the military to deploy the vaccine and FEMA, in conjunction with HHS and the National Guard, should have taken the lead in coordinating all of this 6 months ago."
24631,The Trump admin should have been working on a vaccination program from factory to arm since February or March.
24632,Every problem we've had with Covid-19 is directly attributable to Trump and his sychophants being fucking incompetent.
24633,Why the Defense Production Act hasn't been invoked and a WPA-type program focusing on building out a vaccine distribution and inoculation plan hasn't been developed is borderline criminal.
24634,"States aren't doing what they need to be doing, yes, but it's because the feds dropped this streaming pile of shit in their laps and washed their hands of it."
24635,"While most states and local governments are desperate for Federal funds, they are expected to plan and implement a massive vaccination program?"
24636,It's a goddame shame.
24637,If you have unvaccinated people taking patients with this new strain they;ll be spreading it and be sick.
24638,"I saw Slaoui make the suggestion, nowhere have I found a Moderna recommending that."

24679,Full stop.
24680,That's where the breakdown is.
24681,[removed]
24682,"Here in Canada most say the full ""veterans"" and we really only use it to describe those who participated in past conflicts/peacekeeping operations - combat veterans."
24683,"Most people would not refer to non-commissioned officers as veterans; my dad retired from the military as a Chief Warrant Officer and does not/has never referred to himself as a ""veteran"" or ""vet"" as far as I know."
24684,"Just ""former military""."
24685,Well they are worried about the E484K modification which reduces antibody recognition ... think they still need to test this extensively.
24686,I think everyone should get the vaccine.
24687,"But to play devil's advocate here: the vaccine provides a very high degree of protection against the virus, so if vulnerable people get the vaccine they are no longer all that vulnerable."
24688,"Hence, once all of the vulnerable people have been vaccinated there is much less risk of a young person spreading the disease to someone who could die from it."
24689,"Regarding your last sentence, I guess it depends on what you mean by ""stop the pandemic""."
24690,"If its ""reduce deaths and hospitalizations to approximately flu levels"", then this will happen once the most vulnerable (mostly elderly) are vaccinated."
24691,"If its ""eradicate the virus"", then most scientists believe that this is impossible no matter who gets vaccinated."
24692,Did many army vets die in iraq/afgan wars?
24693,I thought it was mostly active duty?
24694,I‚Äôm an immune compromised healthcare worker that works with PUI and COVID patients but in an outpatient setting.
24695,My vaccine has been delayed due to me not being directly associated with a hospital group.
24696,This whole thing is a colossal fuck up and both state leaders and health officials are responsible.
24697,They need to roll it out to community spots like pharmacies to expedite roll out for both healthcare and at risk.
24698,I want my non healthcare and at risk loved ones to get it ASAP too.
24699,A pharmacist without a first year biology understanding of the difference between DNA and RNA lmao.
24700,Many people do indeed go back to work as well
24701,"I'll stand for restrictions for as long as the case numbers justify them, regardless of how many months it has been."
24702,One in five Americans don't even own a smartphone.
24703,Almost the same for tech literacy.
24704,There should be multiple avenues for vaccination signup.
24705,"While I personally wouldn't make the downloading of an app the hill I would die from COVID on, it's also irritating that to get the vaccine, you should be required to consent to the app's privacy policies and not just standard HIPAA."
24706,"As someone with endometriosis (it took an actual 10 years to find a doctor willing to do the lap to diagnose), I am unfortunately super familiar with how our medical community treats those with chronic illnesses"
24707,It's not ignorant HC workers' fault that the government distributed too many vaccines to hospitals rather than at-risk populations.
24708,‚ÄúDoctor says I need a backiotomy.‚Äù
24709,"But now that the vaccines are being approved after a year, hopefully within a month they could start producing ""fixed"" vaccines and fingers crossed it would take another year or more for another mutation to happen."
24710,We were just a month into administering these when this one popped up (and they don't know yet whether the vaccine is ineffective).
24711,"So hopefully with the ""fixed"" vaccine we will finally get ahead of this thing."
24712,Airports are a federal jurisdiction
24713,"&gt; Protection is on a sliding scale

Which, if one is extremely polarized toward one way of thinking and only sees things in black and white, translates to an all or nothing approach."
24714,"Which to be fair, when 52% (popular vote) = 57% (electoral college votes) = 100% winner takes all, black and white thinking is an easy trap to fall into."
24715,What state/county are you in where I can sign up?
24716,I will drive.
24717,I have an autoimmune and I‚Äôve even asked my doctors to put me in the front of the line.
24718,They are just waiting.
24719,Um... since when was there 350k deaths in Iraq &amp; Afghanistan?
24720,More like WW1&amp;2 combined
24721,"Ok, I was a bit confused on that."
24722,"The big problem, surprise, surprise!"
24723,is that there wasn't an infrastructure put into place so that when vaccines were available that it could seamlessly get distributed.
24724,County health departments aren't remotely set up to handle this in any fashion.
24725,"They don't have the budget, manpower or technology support."
24726,"In theory getting more shots in arms asap sounds great, but without some controls I see that system being rife with abuse."
24727,"Well people are going to panic when they call for an ambulance and one never shows up, while their family member is laying on the floor."
24728,"So like it or not, yeah, that's gonna make people panic."
24729,And how do you skip the line when there's less and less space in the ER because it's clogged up with people who would not follow safety guidelines during an airborne viral pandemic?
24730,How do you do that?
24731,Walk me through it.
24732,And then what about all the other people who got skipped over for that reason who would have otherwise survived?
24733,What about that?
24734,The same data can lead to different decision based on risk profiles.
24735,The US is saying that the 4 extra days of quarantine is a price not worth paying for the increase change of catching late cases.
24736,China is saying that the 7 extra days of quarantine is a price worth paying for the increase chance of catching late cases.
24737,There's also a strong argument for everyone getting one dose to be partially immunized rather than having everyone get two right away.
24738,"The main reason the recommended gap is so short is because that is what was tested, and that gap was tested in order to get through Phase III trials faster."
24739,Waiting 3-4 months instead of 3-4 weeks may not make much difference in the end effectiveness (and would still be far shorter than any other multi-dose immunization schedule).
24740,UK looks like they are about to switch to this strategy.
24741,FDA is still sticking with what was tested though.
24742,I for real thought this was about veterinarians ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
24743,"All (3) MDs in my family want it ASAP, in fact 1 has already had the 1st dose and another is booked in for this Friday."
24744,Canadian using Quebec as scapegoat for their own shortcoming isn't new
24745,"Sorry then you a shit American USA USA USA

Turn you TO GLASS MOTHER FUCKAHA TOWELNHEADS!!"
24746,"Americans... can‚Äôt live with them, can't live without them because they will let you fucking know on social media"
24747,"Ok, fair argument."
24748,"But even if I wanted the vaccine right now, based on risk class my mother, father, grandparents (only 1 left, and she's on the other end of the country) etc."
24749,will be eligible to get the vaccine before I am.
24750,So really it's on them to get the vaccine.
24751,This is aside from the fact that I rarely see my at-risk family members.
24752,"Sorry, thought it was pretty obvious I was comparing cities within the US considering your main point was Arizona vs NY and NJ"
24753,Plague rat
24754,Pregnant women(at least in the US) can talk with their doctor and chose to get the vaccine if they want.
24755,IIRC its because there are some known risks associated with getting covid while pregnant as well as if the mother is high risk for dying of covid then the vaccine may be the choice she(and her doctor) decides is safest for her.
24756,Cuomo is threatening to imprison them now!
24757,What state/county?
24758,Many counties haven't begun rolling the vaccine out to the general public (i.e.
24759,"non-healthcare workers) yet, so it's possible it's just not live yet."
24760,Agree - with a flu vaccine with full FDA approval we could mandate it for all employees.
24761,That's just not the case with this EUA authorization.
24762,People are scared.
24763,They are also ignorant.
24764,But the fear is real to them.
24765,Mostly because no one goes there?
24766,Come to Ontatio and take a look lmao
24767,Exactly.
24768,This is very unusual.
24769,We are about 50k deaths away from the number of American deaths in WWII.
24770,The USA was involved in WWII for 4 years.
24771,The first death from COVID in the USA was in late January or early February.
24772,"So the question is, will COVID's death rate be just higher or just lower than WWII?"

24796,Do we have evidence that the vaccine would still be as effective after this delay?
24797,"At the very least, [CVS](https://www.cvs.com/content/coronavirus) is having field teams doing the rounds at long-term care facilities."
24798,"I'm reasonably sure their regular pharmacies could handle the work, especially if they don't have to do any sort of additional administrative verifications (e.g."
24799,checking priority groups).
24800,Other pharmacies are probably in a similar state.

24802,"Other hospitals are getting around it by setting up ""beds"" in rooms where they wouldn't be able to use equipment and that wouldn't be staffed, so technically they aren't at ""zero"", but they don't actually have available beds for people to be treated in."
24803,Exponential growth?
24804,"Hate to be the bearer of bad news, we‚Äôre the country exporting the antimask, antivax, anti science propaganda."
24805,Canada‚Äôs job would have been measurably easier had the US not just gone so overconfidently off the rails.
24806,The bottleneck isn't in the number of vaccines but in how many people they can vaccinate per day.
24807,So the logic is some in roles that don't require face fo face interaction would decline so that frontline workers can get them earlier.
24808,"If you‚Äôre gunning for it, call around and se did your local pharmacies/hospitals have a list going already."
24809,I saw in another thread someone did this and got vaccinated after only a few days.
24810,Totally area dependent of course.
24811,Not really.
24812,1.
24813,Because it‚Äôs all two doses we need to hold 50% of the vaccine in reserve for the second dose for everyone that got a first.
24814,So the ‚Äú30% distributed‚Äù number is actually 60% of the vaccine we could have distributed at this point.
24815,It‚Äôs not as bad as the headline makes it out to be.
24816,2.
24817,We simply don‚Äôt have the staff in a lot of the medical facilities to speed up distribution.

24823,We don't need the military though.
24824,"The issue that's slowing it up isn't a lack of people capable of sticking a needle in an arm, it's that hospitals are hoarding the vaccines for their staff and not making them available to the elderly."
24825,"as an American, I approve of this message."
24826,U think someone could come up with a vaccine that you could give to yourself?
24827,Not like we don't already have lots of folks giving themselves insulin shots.

24872,I think a lot of that difference is due to the capability of smaller hospitals/clinics to receive and administer vaccines.
24873,"First of all, the ones that didn't have capacity for -70F storage got Moderna, which was shipped days after Pfizer, bigger organizations probably got theirs first even if it was the same vaccine, and smaller organizations have a harder time sparing staff for vaccination."

25029,We haven't hit the anti-vaxers at large yet unless they are sitting at hospitals where all the workers who wanted it have it.
25030,I'll assume they thought since everyone wears masks when sick it'll be enough to widespread use of masks would be enough to supress the virus on it's own.
25031,"My dad died of Covid recently, and my relatives who were with him were quite hostile to the staff involved in his care (every time they went to hospital, they were confronted with hospital bills and the sense of ""pay now or he dies"" that they got from hospital admin wasn't helpful)."

25037,Of the 800k vaccinated reviewed at that time 652 reported reaction to the vaccine.
25038,"51 required medical attention, 35 of them went to the ER of which 4 were hospitalized."
25039,In 2 of these cases the reason for hospitalization was later determined to have nothing to do with the vaccine.
25040,1 likely has nothing to do with the vaccine.
25041,1 case of a 36 year old women that was hospitalized with Rheumatoid arthritis may have something to do with the vaccine (the condition was preexisting but the reaction may have worsened her condition).

25089,There are so many factors to it that you can‚Äôt really label ‚Äúmask mandate‚Äù as reducing R by 0.35 or x%.
25090,The effectiveness will wax and wane with time too.
25091,"You can try to make R low, but you‚Äôre not going to maintain it at exactly 1.0, it‚Äôs just not sensible in comparison to keeping it at 0.7-0.9."

25093,Just horrible for small businesses..limit..open..close..open..limit..close...open..limit..close..and so on..worst business model EVER
25094,So how did Pfizer get to 95% effectively with their phase 3 trial?

25100,"mRNA vaccines have been studied before for flu, Zika, rabies, and cytomegalovirus (CMV)."
25101,"As soon as the necessary information about the virus that causes COVID-19 was available, scientists began designing the mRNA instructions for cells to build the unique spike protein into an mRNA vaccine."
25102,"Future mRNA vaccine technology may allow for one vaccine to provide protection for multiple diseases, thus decreasing the number of shots needed for protection against common vaccine-preventable diseases."
25103,"Beyond vaccines, cancer research has used mRNA to trigger the immune system to target specific cancer cells."
25104,That's straight from the CDC website.
25105,mRNA has been used before.

25113,you're just not understanding what de novo assembly is used for.
25114,"it is not used to create anything new, it's used for sequencing genomes that have a structure or composition that isn't known."
25115,think of it as reverse engineering.
25116,In NYC the areas with severes outbreaks are densily populated outer borough neighborhoods where people are crammed into multifamily housing.
25117,Only exception is Staten Island which suburban and sparsely population compared to the rest of NYC.
25118,Guess who they voted for...
25119,"&gt; Houston med center across hospitals is now 1000's and 1000s of people, who...had a sore shoulder and little else for side effects."
25120,"Yeah, but it takes the second shot for the microchip to self-assemble and turn people into zombies."
25121,"Pfizer have said at *least* one year, based on studied from SARS1 it is more likely many years and possibly even decades."
25122,"More vulnerable people can get more frequent booster shots, like we do for Hepatitis B vaccines."
25123,Shame.
25124,Part of the massive Operation Warp Speed failure was the failure to fight anti-vaxx messaging.
25125,We knew this would be an issue and they didnt design a program to fight it.
25126,The other major failure was not supporting states in distributing snd administering the vaccine.
25127,There are other solutions to boredom.
25128,"Also, it takes months, more likely years to make full feature films and long series shows."
25129,Whatever they're filming now is not likely to be shown until 2022 or 23.
25130,Because 99% of nurses will not die even if they got infected...
25131,"So the headline is just fear mongering and hyperbolic...

One can make an arguement for better resources without pretending that they are at risk of certain death...

And this is from the same people who do tik tok dance videos and ask us to clap for them..."
25132,&gt; The only good thing about that is that we only need to vaccinate ~20% of people to reach immunity.
25133,...err..
25134,No other country would have needed to respond if China reported properly and kept the CHINA VIRUS under control instead of letting thousands of CCP citizens travel all over the world.

25147,"You keep saying the delivery method, you are incorrect here."
25148,This isn‚Äôt a new delivery method this is an entirely new way to replicate a protein inside a human.
25149,We are literally hijacking cells to manufacture spike proteins to feed to our T cells.
25150,No other vaccine has done this before.
25151,It's actually 5/6th that are unused.
25152,"We are only talking about the half that are distributed, but the feds are holding onto the other half for second doses."
25153,If we weren't stockpiling there would be 40 million people who could have gotten the first dose by now.
25154,Until it mutates to a point where a new vaccine has to be engineered.
25155,6 weeks is what BioNtech says they need.
25156,"Then it's all about the logistics and administering the jabs, which we are failing at."
25157,"The longer it takes to get everyone vaccinated, the longer we will be in this loop."
25158,"One silver lining (if you can call it one) at least here in NY, is that while more people are testing positive, a TON more tests are being done."
25159,"Yes, a good amount of positives are related to people being reckless and careless and going to see family."
25160,"But I‚Äôve heard of about half a dozen people I know who weren‚Äôt feeling sick, who went to get tested so they can spend the holiday with family, and tested positive."
25161,Safe to say they stayed at home.
25162,"I‚Äôm not sure there is a positive but I wake up every day and tell myself ‚Äúa few more months.‚Äù No, I haven‚Äôt totally sheltered myself from the world."
25163,"I go grocery shopping, I go for walks when it‚Äôs nice out."
25164,When numbers were down I visited friends outdoors.
25165,"But like I tell my family: I‚Äôll give you a dollar today, but you may owe me two in a month; or I‚Äôll give you $50 to keep in 3 months."

25169,"The headline is misleading, and doesn‚Äôt really change anything, at least in this area."
25170,EMS has always had strict protocol on procedures and transport.
25171,Imagine doing it the week Biden took over.....!
25172,Everyone without a job got $700 a week (job seeker) and those companies struggling (due to lockdowns) got $700 a week per employee to keep them in a job.

25182,"I agree with you, but there is something to be said for federal aid to state and local governments."
25183,The federal government is the only part of US govt that‚Äôs able to deficit spend and the GOP has blocked any attempts for an aid package to state/local governments.
25184,"Income for these governments is way down due to the slowing of the economy, and without additional money from the federal government there‚Äôs only so much they can do to procure additional supplies."
25185,We have spent the better part of a year pushing the idea that going out without a mask or doing any sort of unnecessary activities is the equivalent of asymptomatically spreading a deadly disease.

25218,"some hospitals are full, and have declared emergencies."
25219,things are bad.
25220,It's a bit of a race at the moment to get the vaccine out to people before corona manages to spread too much.
25221,by having the lock down we are hopefully giving ourselves the time to vaccinate the most at risk.

25418,gotta say it's extremely frustrating that the same people who are calling our age group a bunch of amoral psychos for wanting to date during 2020 will be complaining that we're waiting too long to settle down and not churning out babies four or five years down the road.

25614,So what I gathered so far: nothing is certain but the vaccine will most likely work against the British variant.
25615,No data yet for the South African variant.
25616,Might go either way.
25617,The RNA-vaccines can be adapted within something like 6 weeks.
25618,"However, I'm not sure about the Oxford vaccine."
25619,"Now, even if for example the Pfizer vaccine is adapted to the South African variant, it will take a while before it is produced in large quantities I would guess."
25620,"Also, I have seen no answers to the question whether the adapted version of the vaccine would still work against the earlier variants of the virus."
25621,The hoops people are jumping through to defend Fauci lying is incredible.
25622,you want people to do the opposite of what you say lying is a real good way to get there.
25623,SoCal is at that point.

25625,And the LA area is no small part of the California numbers.
25626,Not that other areas are doing great...  but they're not wait-seven-hours-for-care.
25627,Old vaccines are made with old tech that is tried and tested and no we have had vaccines for hundreds of years.
25628,We have hurt people in the past with new vaccine tech.
25629,Almost every vaccine you have taken in your life was tried for many years before you got it.

25646,&gt; Are you able to explain how you got to your seasonality theory.
25647,Sure.
25648,Its called looking at literally every flu virus in the last 50 years.
25649,Flu is seasonal.
25650,"Flu is also caused by different coronaviruses, which are similar to this one."
25651,I know this will come as shocking news to you.
25652,Give it a few days to sink in.
25653,Yes..  it‚Äôs too early!
25654,!
25655,I think it's definitely due to several factors.
25656,"The main ones I can think of are the influx of Snowbirds (people who live somewhere else for the hot summer and come back to AZ in the winter when it's more pleasant, typically elderly people) and a lot of people here just do not care."
25657,The amount of masks I see worn improperly is too damn high.
25658,"They can't really just 'close down the border' there is a lot of trade to China and Russia, including vital imports."
25659,"They can keep it pretty tight, but there will be leakage."

25666,What do you mean it‚Äôs not FDA approved?
25667,Didn‚Äôt the FDA release an emergency use authorization for the vaccines?
25668,They announced the new strain once it became apparent that it was spreading at a faster rate.
25669,There are untold mutation of the virus that you haven't heard about.
25670,This is standard of care in hospitals since the pandemic started.
25671,"Negative test before traveling, and a second test when arriving."
25672,If you want to trace internationally during a pandemic you should be prepared to pay the fee to be tested in the country you travel to.
25673,That De Blasio if I am no mistaken.
25674,It‚Äôs definitely turned a lot of people into self absorbed narcissists
25675,So I guess if her kids die she's OK with it being for a good cause.
25676,Then the messaging is wrong.
25677,Yep and they probably all had vaccines as kids too.
25678,"I guess the difference is that this one was not fully tested and authorized by the FDA, it was fast tracked."
25679,But if this is their main objection then this would mean they have a ton of faith in the FDA which they probably don't...
25680,And then blame it on Obama.
25681,So?
25682,"If they're outside, who gives a shit?"
25683,The states deserve all of the blame.
25684,ONly 5 states have used even half of the vaccines they've been allotted.
25685,Operation warp speed can give guideline for who should be a priority but they can't go to every single hospital and clinic in the country and come up with a plan for each of them individually.
25686,That's much easier for the individual state departments of health to handle.
25687,"Trump's job is to get them the vaccine, which he's done, it's up to the states to decide what the best way to distribute it is."
25688,&gt;As far as saying Coach K's only reason is because it's the worst season record in 4 years; that's a lame argument for a couple reasons.
25689,They have been a #1 or #2 seed in each March madness tourney that has happened in that time and have had  over a 75% winrate padded in a large part by non-conference games (which he cancelled this year).
25690,They still have a 60% winrate and he is a two time HoF coach already.
25691,"Boeheim already addressed this lame attack that was originally made by Nate Oats https://www.si.com/college/syracuse/basketball/boeheim-criticizes-nate-oats-defends-coach-k

AS someone from upstate, I am well aware of Boeheim's defense of Coach K, the doesn't excuse the 180 he took AFTER his team saw 2 defeats."
25692,"I just dont think you can discount it, he was pushing for the tourney last year, pushed for it in the fall and then was a coach supporting the 300+ team tournament model this year."

25694,"Yes I want to see them play as much or more than most people, but I can wait."

25701,"Also, yes, most places are not transporting persons in cardiac arrest unless if we get a heart beat again."
25702,Only then are they transported.

25797,"I am the biggest fan of masks, I will say that."
25798,I wear a KN95 at all times indoors (if I am not in my personal office or in a gym where I wear a sport mask) and I believe it saved me from getting COVID at least twice.

25800,"I got 3 tests over the next 2 weeks and was never positive, and an antibody test the day I got my shot confirmed it...."

25911,Simply hasn't been much research.
25912,That's why we're vaccinating even those who have had covid already.
25913,Thirdly right now reinfections of covid is rare so could have simply been they were just unlucky.

26412,But the article in question is about people who are now getting their second shot delayed for an unknown time.
26413,That's what I have a problem with.
26414,"According to Pfizer, these people were supposed to get their second shot, and the hospital cancelled it."
26415,Is there anywhere where Pfizer said the time of the second dose can be delayed indefinitely with no loss of efficacy?
26416,It's the same hypocrisy you find with Blue Lives Matter.
26417,More police have died in 2020 from COVID than all of 2019 combined.
26418,COVID is more than 3x as deadly as officer related shootings from 2019.
26419,Currently in 2020 COVID accounts for over 55% of police deaths.
26420,But they will still scream Blue Lives Matter every time they see something BLM while refusing to wear a mask.

26437,"The staff has to answer any questions the patient has, which are more than usual since it‚Äôs a new vaccine."
26438,Then the patient had to be supervised for 15 minutes in case any bad side affects arise.

26567,"All these people that are mass testing currently, once they receive their results will go about their daily lives and potentially become positive unknowingly afterwards and perpetuate this cycle."
26568,"&gt;The vaccines were tested as a single dose, right before the second dose was administered."
26569,We have 21 days of data on single doses being up to 85% effective for both Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.
26570,21 days of data is not enough.
26571,You need longer time periods.
26572,Lets say that someone gets infected 5 days before getting the second dose.
26573,They are then in the hospital and get a test 12 days later (7 after getting the second dose).
26574,"Do you say that the two doses failed, or the first dose failed?"
26575,"In the real world, how do you know?"
26576,This also applies to people who contracted it right before the first dose.
26577,"And then, it could just be that not very many people are exposed in that few weeks between doses."
26578,"Remember, the majority of people haven't gotten this virus in the entire time it's existed."
26579,Single doses need to be tested before you give it to hundreds of millions of people.
26580,That's all there is to it.

26586,"They have not ""ruled out"" transmitting the virus even after you've been vaccinated."
26587,"But the only way this can occur is if you get the virus in your body, but it is somewhere that your body won't fight it off, and you then shed or spread it, and it somehow stays alive enough to infect someone else."
26588,"So, like, it's in your nose, and just hanging out there for however long, and then you sneeze."
26589,"It's a little bit like getting it on your hand, and it lives there on your skin, and you shake someone else's hand."

26595,"‚ÄúDistrict 1 Shot 1 will be given between Jan 6th and Jan 9th show up with your ID.‚Äù

26610,You didnt point out anything regarding travel.
26611,It's an opinion you have.
26612,"Where is the data that infers interstate travel, let alone travel of any type is a major contributor to covid spread?"
26613,This is the onus that missing when nannies have their authoritarian fantasies.
26614,You have to provide data that strongly infers that restrictions will have a measurable impact or nobody will care.
26615,Then you have to convince the public that the benefit is worth the rescinding of  rights.
26616,Oh sadly not based on scientific evidence.
26617,Making up efficacy numbers.
26618,The trial only showed 52 percent efficacy between the first and 2nd dose of the vaccine.
26619,Playing with fire they are.
26620,Two-tier healthcare cross-border style.
26621,At this point new people coming into the country would actually be lowering the overall infection rate so I'm not quite sure that should be the top priority...
26622,"March, November and January."
26623,"There was Tier 4 for parts of the country in December, but not a lockdown."
26624,The PlayStation release!
26625,!
26626,"If the virus were better controlled, it would be mutating less."
26627,"Anyway, the vaccines might still be highly effective against this."
26628,Let's hope.
26629,"Yeah, people don‚Äôt seem to get the fact that this isn‚Äôt going to go away, and that it‚Äôs going to get worse before it gets better."
26630,"Well, besides the fact that he could get covid himself, there are also people who cannot safely get any vaccine, people with certain medical conditions or immunodeficiencies."

26638,People should be focusing on the 90% O2 sat but instead are focused on a memo that basically reiterates policy.
26639,Which EMS memos do all the time.
26640,"Totally anecdotal but I know two people who have basically experienced ""get here within X minutes if you want a vaccine""."

26655,&gt;He is suggesting that infrastructure should be built around allowing the general public access to vaccines that are being stored instead of distributed as well.
26656,A Walgreens pharmacy did something like this and it became a top news story a few weeks ago with corporate Walgreens apologizing.
26657,Basically they had 20 leftover doses set to expire soon.
26658,So they just vaccinated the 20 people left in the store before closing.
26659,Never saw the single dose efficacy being that high nor do I think we actually know considering that they didn‚Äôt study single dose efficacy.
26660,I don‚Äôt disagree with your sentiment but I am only saying we should consider consequences of doing what you‚Äôre suggesting as it isn‚Äôt a win-win scenario necessarily.
26661,Yes.
26662,And with most countries it is the other way around: excess deaths exceed Covid deaths by a long shot.
26663,"And we know that in the US at least, even the majority of excess deaths in the 25-44 year old range are not Covid deaths."
26664,"(According to CIDRAP, run by Michael Osterholm, Biden‚Äôs new Covid advisor)

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/12/data-reveal-deadliness-covid-19-even-young-adults

And we know that it isn‚Äôt just this age range this is happening with either."
26665,"The number one cause of excess mortality, according to the CDC‚Äôs website on excess mortality date, the number one cause of all excess deaths is Alzheimer‚Äôs and dementia, which is happening in the elderly population."
26666,Not surprising if you know what it takes to properly care for these people.
26667,"And so many people want to blame these excess deaths on Covid indirectly, not our response to Covid."
26668,But it is good that Sweden‚Äôs data shows that isn‚Äôt true.
26669,Uhm chronic illnesses are a disability if it disables you.

26684,&gt; Current vaccines only keep you out of the hospital.
26685,You can still get infected and spread it.
26686,Fact check: this is not really correct.
26687,The Moderna trials showed a 66% reduction in asymptomatic transmission after just one dose at 21 days.
26688,It's likely the vaccines provide sterilizing immunity.
26689,Doesn't it take nurses to administer those?
26690,Veterans are another group of marginalized people.
26691,Marginalized people are suffering from it at a higher rate
26692,"I‚Äôm kinda liking the enhanced cleaning, special attention to personal hygiene, social distancing, face masks, face shields, and smaller gatherings."

26696,"True, we (Finland) have been one of the slowest because of the christmas holidays."
26697,"We also didn't get as many doses of vaccine as were promised, but that's propably the same elsewhere in the EU too."
26698,That sounds like a very scary situation - but I do want to assure you that in EMS we do not confuse 'unresponsive' with 'dead'.
26699,That's not a thing.
26700,Because we have monitors and capnography and O2 monitors and there is no way in high holy hell we'd leave someone who is struggling but not yet dead.
26701,If you have a CVA or a heart attack and are not dead we will not just leave.
26702,you will receive full care.

26707,No pun detected.
26708,does that nurse refuse to play the ps5 since it's too soon to know it's long term effects either?
26709,At this point I'll stand on my porch and let someone shoot a vaccine blow dart into my butt cheek if it meant I could get the vaccine today.
26710,"As a person whose spouse works at a hospital, the ""system"" they had in place was fucking TERRIBLE to administer shots."
26711,"They tried to make it all automated and had nothing but glitches and problems, half the people weren't getting notifications, the other half couldn't get appointment dates, just terrible."
26712,This is one of those times having a sign up sheet would have been about 100x better.
26713,"We need to accept that our government does not respect those that give their life to the country, and actively shame them, blocking recruitment until they learn to see soldiers as human."
26714,Of course that won't happen because America's full of a bunch of bootlickers.
26715,"If we can gather data that shows that a single dose has this efficacy, we can pursue that route!"
26716,"But the only data we have right now is for a two dose regimen, and that‚Äôs what we should stick with until we have actual data and not just speculation about the efficacy of a single dose."
26717,"The only vaccine I‚Äôm aware of that has been tested at a 12 week interval is the AZ vaccine, which has not yet been approved in most countries pending additional data."
26718,It‚Äôs important to note that the 62% efficacy number of the AZ vaccine (*not* 70%) is only after both doses.
26719,"The twelve week gap was also only included because AstraZeneca started out testing a single dose regimen, and then changed the study midstream because the signals they had were so strongly indicating a second dose would be important to protection and that a single would be insufficient to help:

&gt;	The 18‚Äì55-year-old cohorts were originally planned as single-dose efficacy cohorts."
26720,"However, the protocol was modified on July 20, 2020, to offer a second dose to the participants in these cohorts as a result of robust booster responses identified in the evaluation of the early immunogenicity cohorts (version 9.0; appendix 2 pp 331‚Äì332).5 Boosting began on Aug 3, 2020, resulting in a longer gap between prime and booster vaccines in these cohorts than for those aged 55‚Äì69 years and those aged 70 years or older, as these participants were enrolled into two-dose groups from the start."
26721,It's ridiculous that an article asking that question doesn't even bother to provide information on how many daily injections these pop-up sites are capable of achieving.
26722,I am in group 1B.
26723,"The waiting list in Lorain county, which is contiguous with Erie county, has thousands of people on it waiting for the vaccine."
26724,I don't imagine Erie county doesn't have a waiting list on 1B.
26725,I am hopeful that we may have a national mandate.
26726,Drive up for jabs administered by the Ohio National Guard in parking garages or tents.
26727,When you have a shortage of the vaccine and allow local politicians to determine who is eligible the rollout will be chaotic.
26728,Lockdown starts tomorrow
26729,He's in his late 30's.
26730,"I'm not sure I feel comfortable visiting him, when I can, if he's not vaccinated."
26731,So I'm trying to find out if it would be an issue or not
26732,i hope the rule breakers remember what they did when there comes a day they themselves hang a sign with a rule on it.
26733,"&gt; General public is one thing, ‚Äúliberty‚Äù and all that, but come on."

26740,Seniors aren‚Äôt going out every day to concerts to begin with.
26741,They get it by contacting with younger people who are either their relatives or their caretakers.
26742,That‚Äôs what the lockdown is for.
26743,People aren‚Äôt stupid.
26744,If they can just isolate seniors they would and avoid the economic destruction.
26745,I think Pfizer one is more mild.

26747,Sore arms though!
26748,Okay I thought it was Goldwater for some reason
26749,There's no implication or inference or any of that.
26750,"It's black and white, the data doesn't support anyone's claim that the vaccines prevent transmission."
26751,Unless you want to gamble and lean toward your answer.
26752,But don't mix up something you feel or believe or hope for as scientific evidence or anything close to it.

26755,The argument that since Fox is biased it is Ok for MSN to be biased?
26756,"So no where in the entirety of the article did the author even allude to the fact that, as far as anyone knows, natural infection leads to near 100% immunity at least on a months long scale, and that those recovered individuals are already contributing to the immunity of the herd."
26757,"In the US, for instance, data from the CDC suggests that as many as 150MM Americans (around 45%) have or have already had COVID."
26758,"Confirmed reinfections are negligible, so it's a fair assumption that almost half the US is already immune."
26759,This obviously greatly reduces the vaccination coverage necessary to reach the herd immunity threshold.
26760,Irritating that the author just sets natural immunity aside as though it's not a factor.
26761,"About 4,600 cases and 36 deaths a day over the past week."

26765,"It was frustrating, because I myself used to be into Alex Jones 10ish years ago but came out of that, so I knew the difference between being informed by factual news and believing conspiracies."
26766,the nanobots are making her say these things.
26767,has she bought $MSFT stock already?
26768,I saw Italy's testing today and had no idea they usually do less than 100k a day and recently upped it to 150
26769,We subscribe to the less testing = less cases here in TN!

26892,Those people opting out should be fired.
26893,"I‚Äôm addition to the other responses, the vaccines need to be kept at very low temperatures."
26894,It‚Äôs easier to maintain that in one location rather than a rolling vaccination van.
26895,Plus they‚Äôd have to outfit a ton of trucks and people to administer the vaccines.

26900,Since this thing began among medical professionals the shi***est conversations I‚Äôve had were with nurses.
26901,One was trying to convince me Covid wasn‚Äôt that contagious and that my friend who basically spread it to 8/15 people at a get together in March in 2 hours of hanging out was unrealistic and far fetched (despite the fact that he was the first super spreader in his county and it was the only logical explanation).
26902,The other was deep into Qannon and kept sending me videos about this fake pandemic.
26903,The other one is an anti masker who works in a nursing home that‚Äôs had some really bad outbreaks.
26904,Another keeps saying ‚Äúthis is just like the flu‚Äú along with a string of predictions that are the opposite of what happens.
26905,"Others I know are fantastic, sharp and compassionate."

26934,I can definitely see situations where there are doses left over at the end of a batch.
26935,Rather than try to get the number of doses exactly right why not just embrace this and have a 2nd list of people that can use any leftover doses every day?

26946,"&gt; The strains that are given in the flu shot are different each year, but not new."
26947,"No, they're completely different strains which achieve immune escape, they are much more different than any of the coronavirus variants."
26948,If we can approve yearly flu vaccines we can figure out how to approve modifications to the covid vaccines to incorporate new mRNAs against variants.
26949,"This is a smaller problem than the flu virus, not a bigger problem."
26950,"And the ""packaging"" of the vaccines will remain the same so the side-effect profile will be the same (the allergic reactions to PEG will still happen at the same rate)."
26951,"And we are ramping up the manufacturing of the vaccines, we will be able to replace the existing vaccine supplies that have been distributed in a matter of weeks."
26952,It takes literally only days to redesign the vaccine for a new spike mRNA.
26953,"The only barrier will be political, and if and when immune/vaccine escape is proven that approval will happen very fucking fast."
26954,"We already have to solve the problem of manufacturing and distributing the vaccines 20 times faster than we're doing right now, throwing out what has been produced so far does not restart the clock to 10 months ago, it is just 2 weeks of work being thrown out at the target that we must hit."
26955,This is just not going to be anywhere near the serious problem that anyone in this thread thinks it will.
26956,Half of the whole goddamn selling point of mRNA vaccines is that you can nearly turn them on a dime.
26957,"There's a whole lot of wishful thinking in this thread, though, that everything will fail."
26958,"And I'm very far from breathlessly believing that technology can solve all the worlds problems, but at this point we have actual evidence that mRNA vaccines DO deliver on their promise, betting against them at this point is just ignoring the evidence."
26959,The biggest issue we have now is just the human problem of sorting out stabbing arms with needles on a massive scale and the mismanagement of the phased rollout (but that is also going to get sorted out one way or another after Jan 21st).

26999,Every once in a while you see someone with their nose dangerously close to hanging out but not enough to alarm me.
27000,"If you ask me, the issue here in my area is not people wearing masks in public places and stores-- it's people choosing not to wear masks when they go to visit friends/family indoors."
27001,Maybe because of the dozens of politicians that went on vacation in 2020.

Can anyone link to a source--academic or otherwise--that clearly details the impact of the South African coronavirus variant on younger people?"
27057,I've looked through about a half-dozen news articles.
27058,"All of them make assertions along the lines of South Africa undergoing ""a massive coronavirus spike driven by young people"" without providing any statistics relating to symptoms prevalence or hospitalization."
27059,The Guardian's article does note that many people aged between 15-25 and are testing positive.
27060,"But, so far as I'm aware, young people in many countries have been blamed for spreading COVID simply because they're low-risk and more likely to socialize outside the house."
27061,"Regardless, I don't think it's appropriate to compare COVID-19 to the Spanish Flu--it's really just fear-mongering, given that no strain of this disease is killing young people *en masse* anywhere in the world."

27082,"Once death rates have gone down enough--which will happen before the majority of people are vaccinated, and will probably begin to slowly go down after the holiday bump/first few waves of vaccinations--people are not going to keep this up."

27151,"We won‚Äôt be able to get back to a normal society unless we all, as a whole, accept the science and the data behind it and get the fucking vaccine."
27152,"If you‚Äôre hesitant about getting it, do some ACTUAL reading on the subject from the CDC or an actual reputable source (not Facebook)."
27153,"The sad thing is, there‚Äôs too many ignorant people in America who think everything is a conspiracy or fake news"
27154,"To be fair, it wasn't just Fawchi that pulled that shit, seemingly every first world health authority and the WHO did the same."
27155,Good job FDA.
27156,Health Canada gave a clap back last week at this stupid idea too.
27157,Now if only the EU and UK would stop going down this path of madness.
27158,"If we were going to ignore dosing instructions anyway, we might as well have started vaccinating after phase 2 trials proved the vaccines were safe."
27159,"And by the way, I‚Äôd bet the EU countries aren‚Äôt breaking the dosing regimens because they are confident it will help."
27160,They are doing it to avoid the political fallout from their embarrassing procurement effort.
27161,Case and point: BioNTech is a Germany company.
27162,"Canada is getting just as many per capita doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in Q1 as Germany, and over 4 times as many Moderna doses per capita."
27163,"Calm down people this is normal, the vaccine requires two doses to be effective, nobody getting stolen their first dose."
27164,"**Taiwan research institutions obtain US provisional patent for a new treatment (""bait antibody"") for coronavirus."
27165,"**

I posted the translated version of this news article in r/Taiwan subreddit."
27166,It's a new way of blocking infection and treating patients.
27167,It not only just vaccinates a person.
27168,It also eliminates the virus so it does more than vaccines.
27169,It really sounds like a breakthrough.
27170,National Taiwan University is the Oxford of Taiwan and Academia Sinica is a government funded scientific research institution.
27171,Both are very credible.
27172,They wouldn't have released any of this to the press unless they have confidence in this new breakthrough.
27173,I think this qualifies as the 1st GOOD NEWS of 2021.
27174,[deleted]
27175,Fauci has said he doesn't support but I don't believe he said there is no evidence supporting it I believe that was about the UK plan of extending times between doses.
27176,Slaoui is not some hack he's a legit scientist as well.
27177,I believe Slaoui when he says there's evidence for it and I don't believe he just made it up or all the news organizations reporting it would be discussing that as well.
27178,Like I said I'm not going to try and say if it's a good idea or not.
27179,"I just said there is evidence for it, it's not just a random idea of cut it in half and hope it works."
27180,https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.politico.com/amp/news/2021/01/03/moderna-vaccine-doses-warp-speed-half-453979
27181,Yep.
27182,It's nothing but twats all the way down.
27183,Exactly.
27184,The question was actually when do they personally expect their lives to be normal.
27185,The respondents then extrapolated to society as a whole.
27186,They‚Äôre starting on a different baseline than most and they can‚Äôt be overly optimistic.
27187,If one of them says October I think there is a really good shot at August.
27188,None of these guys want to be caught being wrong on the long end.
27189,Can you imagine what will happen if we‚Äôre not normal by winter after Fauci has said over and over that it should be fall?
27190,He‚Äôs hedging.
27191,Absolutely we won‚Äôt be precovid ever again.
27192,Just like we aren‚Äôt pre 9/11 or even pre Vietnam.
27193,Things change.
27194,"Does that mean we‚Äôre all masked up for years, absolutely not."
27195,I now have a habit of always washing my hands when I come back in the house now.
27196,"See, precovid normal is done with that right there."
27197,[deleted]
27198,It has to be mental illness.
27199,I‚Äôm pretty sure the state pharmacy regulator will look into this.
27200,Fantastic news
27201,Aren't there mask mandates in New Jersey?
27202,Indoor bars and restaurants have to shut down at 10pm.
27203,No dance floors allowed.
27204,No more than 8 people at a table unless from the same household.
27205,Tables should be spaced 6 feet apart.
27206,"Maybe the rules aren't being followed, but there are rules."
27207,"Oh, and people entering the state are 'expected' to quarantine on arrival."
27208,"Now, Georgia, this is the lawless land of COVID."
27209,No mask requirements.
27210,No travel restrictions or quarantines recommended for new arrivals (which means people flock here to enjoy our open bars and restaurants and clubs).
27211,"Everything is open with no special occupancy limits: amusements parks, clubs, bars, massage parlors, tattoo shops, hair salons, movie theaters, whatever, it's open."
27212,Probably because of the lack of shows and slowdown of night-life.
27213,Doing a bunch of cocaine while quarantining alone will lead to looking out through the closed blinds in a paranoid manner.
27214,NJ definitely is.
27215,Depends on the viral load.
27216,Asymptomatic implies a lower load which could lead to a false negative.
27217,You don‚Äôt bag at all?
27218,We have filters we put between the mask and the bag that allows us to give breaths without aerosolizing everything.
27219,Was every US citizen at risk of death during WW2?
27220,That's what I'm basing the rates on.
27221,"Looks like anywhere from 2,000 to 12,000 US civilians died overseas, six actually in the states."
27222,"Even counting the total population during WW2, mortality rate would be 315 per 100,000."
27223,"I wonder if it's because so many of them have already had COVID, believe they're immune, and figure they don't need the vaccine."
27224,It‚Äôs been everywhere!
27225,It‚Äôs unfortunate the US didn‚Äôt detect this first.
27226,"while I was in the military i had a Sergeant tell me this, ""if youre on time youre already late."""
27227,changed my life.
27228,"Come to think of it most kids are completely asymptomatic therefore, as a teacher, you probably get exposed to the virus on multiple occasions."
27229,Not good.
27230,Hope thet get better soon ü§û
27231,Same people who won‚Äôt stay home or wear masks be like: ‚Äúthank y‚Äôall for y‚Äôall‚Äôs service y‚Äôall‚Äù
27232,This has been standard of care for the overwhelming majority of the country for at least the past decade.
27233,"Go pretty much anywhere in the US pre-pandemic and have a cardiac arrest, if your heart doesn‚Äôt start within 20-30 minutes EMS is declaring you dead and aren‚Äôt transporting you to the hospital."
27234,Shame it‚Äôs taken LA a pandemic to catch up to modern standards
27235,Yup.
27236,Poland lost more than 10% of its population during that time
27237,"&gt;they‚Äôre hosting a swingers fest

27238,"Ask New Orleans, 2020!"

27241,That's part of the problem.
27242,"We're still rebelling against higher taxes, and so people are fighting the idea of healthcare for all, which every civilized county in the world has figured out is needed."
27243,And of course they're still going to pay for it one way or the other.
27244,[removed]
27245,Something I dont get.
27246,I keep hearing that places like Florida are taking almost no precautions.
27247,People don't wear masks and are going to restaurants and events.
27248,There are a lot of old people in Florida.
27249,Why do we not hear about hospitals being overrun and people turned away?
27250,But we hear stories about this from places like LA which have some of the strictest regulations.
27251,Everybody PC until the uk or south African strain comes out.
27252,Ya I meant to communicate that in a way that combined those 2 things.

27263,Celebrities and Politicians first.

27266,"Only a tiny fraction of the population has been tested for antibodies, plus, IIRC, antibody tests aren‚Äôt that reliable."
27267,Read recently about a city in northern Brazil (Manaus) that had done large scale antibody testing and the number of people that tested positive was unreasonably high.
27268,"That led people to assume they had gotten near herd immunity, but the disease spread did not reflect that."
27269,I think the conclusion was is there was a large number of false positives.
27270,He/She did the math

27362,Agreed this is the answer.
27363,"They don‚Äôt want the vaccine, okay give it to all the residents and move on."

27370,They are being given $500 to take the vaccine.
27371,No need to get upset in here
27372,Two things.
27373,"One, it only contains the spike protein and none of the rest of the virus."
27374,That means the body learns to target the spike protein and not some other piece of the virus.
27375,Since the spike protein is how it infects cells any mutations without it won't be able to reproduce.
27376,An analogy I read was imagine two dogs that were beaten by someone who always wore a baseball hat.
27377,One dog might learn to fear anyone wearing a baseball hat.
27378,That's what happens when you get Covid now.
27379,The other might learn to be afraid of a rolled up newspaper.
27380,This is more protective since the newspaper is the actual delivery system.
27381,"The vaccine ensures our bodies ""fear"" the right thing."
27382,"Two, the second dose is important, and they hope will cause the vaccine to last longer than just catching it."
27383,"Our bodies are naturally lazy*, we don't waste too much time making lots of antibodies for things we only encounter once."
27384,"We fight it off, store a few notes, and move on."
27385,"When we encounter it again (especially in a short time frame), we trick the body into thinking it's a bigger issue and that the knowledge will be used again, so it works harder to protect us."
27386,"I forget the exact details of what I read, but the two weeks is timed to how long it takes the immune system to do it's thing."
27387,"At the 2 week mark it is in a better position to ""memorize"" what the virus looks like and how to fight it."
27388,"*Efficient is probably a better word, but lazy is a better ""visual"" for this."
27389,Most experts agree that it‚Äôll probably take years until this virus mutates enough to require a new vaccine.

27394,They aren't saying that every white person is rich they are talking about the overall total
27395,Logic would lead me to believe it's mainly credited to having a few large hospital networks within the Chicagoland area.
27396,"Northwestern, Rush, UChicago, North Shore Healthcare etc..."
27397,Which allows for clearer communication between hospitals and outpatient clinics / doctora offices.
27398,But as far as comparing Chicago with another city like NYC or LA I really couldn't say
27399,Why am I having flashbacks
27400,"Just under 1 of every 1,000 residents tested positive."
27401,That is distrusting science.
27402,Experts in this field have gotten together and said this vaccine is safe to use.
27403,If your gut tells you otherwise it‚Äôs going against what expert scientists agree upon.
27404,I get the fear: people are afraid of flying even though it‚Äôs a much safer mode of transportation than driving.
27405,But some people drive because flying is scary.
27406,"This new vaccine is scary to some people, but we are pleading with you to trust science over fear on this."
27407,[removed]
27408,So 8%
27409,All EU countries were free to order any amount of vaccines outside the EU program or not participate in the program at all.
27410,So the answer is likely: the same.
27411,Yeah I totally get what your saying especially because a lot of the solution needs to be localized.
27412,The experts in our state are doing a good job with vaccine distribution and dealing with the surge.
27413,"My husband is an attending in a COVID unit and they were seeing a drop off (and the rest of the state was) before Christmas, thanks to good policy."
27414,I really wish our public health officials were demonized during a pandemic.
27415,"What I was referring to specifically, was over the weekend the Surgeon General and crew put this out there trying to deflect from their awful vaccination distribution response."
27416,My point is this half dose/delayed dose thing isn't even hashed out and current issue of distribution hasn't be fixed or addressed.
27417,"The ""experts"", a whole group of them of them on the federal level, is muddying the waters for the rest of us."
27418,Do you think we do 0 medicine in the back of an ambulance?
27419,This statement is 100% false.
27420,Educate yourself on what we actually do before trying to speak from a position of assumed (and false) knowledge.

27451,*
27452,For me the concern was around the long term effectiveness of the two doses if not administered on the right schedule.
27453,Is the 2nd dose still a 2nd dose if its a month or two late or are we going to be trying to vaccinate the whole population every 2 months since it won't stick with a rolling resistance of 50% in all the people vaccinated.
27454,"Probably unfounded fears based out of ignorance of the working of vaccines but when I (or anyone) isn't informed my first choice would be to follow the guidelines from the manufactures, any deviance makes me nervous."
27455,It‚Äôs a problem that will solve itself before long.
27456,"In Texas, after medical workers and long term care residents the next group includes almost 50% of the population."
27457,About 10 million people.
27458,It should be easy to find patients and then we can just focus on complaining about needing to check every provider for a slot.
27459,I think the supply problem in many places is overblown.
27460,For example yesterday in Texas 414k doses had been administered out of 780k doses received by providers.
27461,About 200k are set aside for long term care facilities which need to have doses allocated about a week early so they can plan their site visits.
27462,That means about 25% are ‚Äúon the shelf‚Äù which can be explained by slow reporting from providers and appointments over the next several days.
27463,I‚Äôm not that worried here.
27464,Some states are a lot further behind and some are further ahead though...
27465,"Well... that seems to he the Texas way...  ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

That is seriously stupid."

27472,Hospitals will be absolutely crushed if life continued on as normal even if you take out the elderly.
27473,"Of those who were hospitalized, about 50% are less than 65 years old and 25% is less than 50yo."
27474,"source: [https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/COVIDNet/COVID19\_5.html](https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/COVIDNet/COVID19_5.html)

Hospitals are on the verge of being overwhelmed and a shorter, spikier infection trend would be devastating."
27475,"Unless you ban the elderly from leaving their home, the best way to protect the elderly is to reduce infection count overall."
27476,Obesity is also a strong risk factor in covid19 severity and 40% of Americans are obese.
27477,Would you also protect that group with free meals delivery and in home doctor visits too?
27478,Would you discourage them from leaving their home?
27479,"I work from home, get grocery delivery, and order essentials off Amazon."
27480,I wear a mask 100% when I go outside for walks on the beach bike path.
27481,Which one of the 600 had access to break the freezer?

27484,People can be doing more productive things then murdering others.

27490,"I will be absolutely shocked if indoor dining, large indoor events, sporting events with fans, etc happen in 2021."
27491,I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any way.

27493,"This makes sense: 

""We have been following the discussions and news reports about reducing the number of doses, extending the length of time between doses, changing the dose (half-dose), or mixing and matching vaccines in order to immunize more people against COVID-19."
27494,These are all reasonable questions to consider and evaluate in clinical trials.
27495,"However, at this time, suggesting changes to the FDA-authorized dosing or schedules of these vaccines is premature and not rooted solidly in the available evidence."""
27496,"So if you take 15 days and the curve doesn't flatten at all, what are you going to do?"
27497,"You guys aren't accomplishing the goals you were aiming for, so you can't expect to have the ""rewards"" that you expected for succeeding."
27498,"I will say though that if your government honestly said it was definitely going to be over in two weeks, they were being idiots."
27499,Where I am it also started with a two-week lockdown but it was clearly stated that it would be extended if needed after reviewing the effects.
27500,They also said this was probably going to be the hardest struggle of our lifetimes; honestly people should have known better if anyone told them that this was going to be just a quick inconvenience.
27501,Can you link to it?
27502,"I'm hoping that it can explain how they can conclude anything with any sort of confidence since the people in the trial had a second dose within, what, 3 weeks of the first dose?"
27503,Would not the data be incredibly noisy in such a small time period?
27504,"&gt;As the first round of vaccine recipients become eligible to receive their second dose, we want to remind the public about the importance of receiving COVID-19 vaccines according to how they‚Äôve been authorized by the FDA in order to safely receive the level of protection observed in the large randomized trials supporting their effectiveness."
27505,"&gt;We have been following the discussions and news reports about reducing the number of doses, extending the length of time between doses, changing the dose (half-dose), or mixing and matching vaccines in order to immunize more people against COVID-19."
27506,These are all reasonable questions to consider and evaluate in clinical trials.
27507,"However, at this time, suggesting changes to the FDA-authorized dosing or schedules of these vaccines is premature and not rooted solidly in the available evidence."
27508,"Without appropriate data supporting such changes in vaccine administration, we run a significant risk of placing public health at risk, undermining the historic vaccination efforts to protect the population from COVID-19."
27509,&gt;The available data continue to support the use of two specified doses of each authorized vaccine at specified intervals.
27510,I'd encourage reading some history and sociology to get some perspective.
27511,"For example, a sociologist named Jib Fowles coined the term ""chrono centrism"" in the 70's in a paper."
27512,"What it is roughly is one's tendency to overestimate and dramatize the extent of the consequences of the times they themselves are living in, e.g."
27513,"""yeah sure people's day to day lives went back to normal after the Black Death, WWI, WWII, the flu Pandemics, the cold war, etc.- But *this time, my time* is the one that will destroy society!"""
27514,Realistically I think another delay
27515,so you are saying that the government will lift restrictions and let people who arent vaccinated just simply get sick?
27516,that they will allow the coronavirus to spread like wildfire?
27517,"going by your logic, they should've only restricted old people and people with comorbidities lol you really are crazy."
27518,thanks for proving my point.
27519,"lmao this was hilarious, yet a bit sad to read."
27520,UK officials are trying to draw attention to the African variant because the UK variant is the one spreading quickly throughout the world.
27521,Cuomo is the governor of one state.
27522,Trump is the president of the entire country.
27523,The entire country has had less than six million vaccines administered in over 3 weeks.
27524,One of these failures is worse.
27525,I honestly want to know where these people live that things aren't 98% back to normal.
27526,I live in a very liberal state and things went back to normal 6 months ago.
27527,And for my family in the South things are even more normal.
27528,Lots of people not even wearing masks.
27529,I‚Äôm getting so tired of the fact that we‚Äôre doing a lot of waiting around for healthcare workers who aren‚Äôt claiming their doses.
27530,"My state has used 20% of what they‚Äôve been allocated, which is insane."
27531,The Texas method (much more simple groups and mostly by age) seems to be working a hell of a lot better than the insanely complex plans many states have.
27532,We also didn‚Äôt get any fed money to train people to administer vaccines or to monitor the waiting rooms for after vaccination which can‚Äôt have helped given that we have a nursing shortage.
27533,Overall this is a complete disaster and I‚Äôm really bummed
27534,"America's ""literal crash program"" for testing appears to be nothing of the sort."
27535,"Basically, just using the lab capacity that was there and not expanding it in any dramatic way."
27536,Embarrassing and deadly.
27537,I think it means that 80% of people are in favor of lockdowns that affect other people but have special exemptions for certain things with themselves because they are unique.
27538,Ah yes.

27549,"It‚Äôs not exact, and while they‚Äôre guaranteed 5, they have to guess on how much excess is left."
27550,It‚Äôs likely that was a large part of the issue.
27551,I‚Äôd only we had a ton of people out of a job right now that would Love to get paid to help.

27592,"The (half serious) ‚Äújoke‚Äù I heard over and over from medical residents was that you could go to a 3rd world country to see all the obscure diseases you read about in your med school textbook, or just rotate through Riverside County Medical Center."

27599,Is it possible that Covid mutates and changes and becomes more dangerous?
27600,Absolutely.
27601,But that‚Äôs not the most likely reason behind what ARMC and RCMC physicians are recounting in this article.
27602,But the trials showed a robust immune response.
27603,So the case numbers must start going down.
27604,"I mean, all they gotta do is check the antibody levels of some of the first vaccine recipients in the trials right now and I'm confident they still have great titer levels."

27728,Good for them (truly).
27729,They‚Äôre not here.
27730,the virus isnt dangerous to a certain subset of the population.
27731,its dangerous for everyone.
27732,"yes younger people may have a higher probability of surviving than older people, but that doesnt make it not dangerous lmao."
27733,"dude, you said lift all restrictions once 20% are vaccinated."
27734,"you think masks, social distancing, and capacity will just be lifted at a snap of a finger?"
27735,we dont live in a dreamland.
27736,things will become gradual.
27737,stop saying two different things.
27738,you're talking from a completely different tone now.
27739,"yes, we'd all like things get back to normal but the government isnt going risk people's lives."
27740,thats why restrictions were made in the first place.
27741,"if only old people and people with comorbidities were susceptible to the coronavirus, then why didnt they just restrict ""certain subset of the population""?"
27742,lol wtf.

27750,Acquiring ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù just at the same time that the vaccine is widely available is truly sad.
27751,Reinstate the maginot line
27752,So not really accurate to use it then is it?
27753,Considering it's still less the 1% of the population that's even cought the virus let alone die.
27754,Also  a military term used when 1 out of every ten men is killed.

27776,"Of the many random things that is stuck in my memory, I recall seeing a video of people protesting an Evanescence concert on MTV or a similar channel back when Evanescence had their breakthrough."
27777,"There were a few people who had gone out of their way to protest one of their concerts, and were actively mocking the people in line to get into the concert, saying that they all had horrible taste in music."
27778,"While I don't see the point in shitting on people for liking whatever band/artist is currently cool to not like (Evanescence, Nickelback, etc."
27779,"), I certainly question how you can't have something better to do with your time than to actually physically go and berate people standing in line for one of their concerts."
27780,They meant the first and second phases after phase 1A3.
27781,All 75+ are 1B1; high-risk 65-74 are 1B2.
27782,"High risk 16-64 are 1Cx (1C1, 1C2, 1C3, 1C4, etc.)."
27783,The compositions of different phases in 1C are only proposed and have not been codified.
27784,I wonder if you swabbed the inside of your nose with it if it would kill the virus before it can invade the epithelial cells there.
27785,This might turn out to be a good local preventative.
27786,But people would have to keep their mouths shut!
27787,Or swab their mouths with it.
27788,I don't get what people are waiting for anymore?
27789,Like millions have received the vaccine.
27790,They aren't really waiting.
27791,"They're waiting for the 1 report of a person being hospitalized, out of millions, so they can point to it and say, see, told you, not safe."
27792,Ignoring that any random sampling of millions who caught covid would have so many more deaths and hospitalizations.

27796,"Once Biden is inaugurated suddenly the figures will be accurate and to them it‚Äôll be as if 500,000 died the second he was sworn in."
27797,This was their playbook in 2016 and it worked so I don‚Äôt see why they wouldn‚Äôt do it again.

27807,Just because a person is gay doesn‚Äôt mean they can‚Äôt be mentally unstable and do atrocious things.
27808,You‚Äôre pretty much saying that it‚Äôs homophobic to point out that people with AIDS have committed criminal transmission of AIDS.
27809,"It‚Äôs a valid criminal act, there‚Äôs been 168 documented cases of persecution."
27810,"Not every person with AIDS is gay either, and the pharmacist you replied to did not state ‚Äúgays with AIDS‚Äù."

27819,An interesting strategy and one I thought Canada should do.
27820,Vaccinate the working class and indirectly protect the vulnerable.
27821,But once you see how few vaccines there will actually be during the year it makes way more sense to vaccinate the elderly.

27827,"The risk being unknown, in my opinion makes informed consent not possible."

27829,If you actually agree to take an unknown risk and are aware of what this means then you are right and you can call it informed consent.

27838,My sister-in-law is a pharmacist and she's about as sharp as a bowling ball.
27839,I get your point but accepting that education doesn't necessarily indicate intelligence is a hard lesson my trump-loving family loves to educate everyone on.
27840,It took us a lot longer than 9 months to ramp Liberty Ship production to that rate.
27841,The truth is painful but not as painful as being kept alive pointlessly by family members who cannot accept reality.

27845,"No batteries, unless you get an induction heater."
27846,I can already hear the shaking from across the pond.
27847,Yes and in theory we are fine but also in theory the vaccine efficacy drops a bit with this new variant.
27848,Everything needs to be tested to be sure...which they are doing now.
27849,But if it bears out that this mutation decreases efficacy it sets up the question 'how many mutations until we have rework the vaccine'?
27850,Which they can do but it takes time and the logistics are killer on this.
27851,More evidence is showing that sanitizing does little.
27852,Covid is airborne.
27853,Stay outdoors.

27903,Want to bet 1000$ that new york has more deaths per capita than arizona by the end of Feb?
27904,The goal posts had to move because the Trump administration decided to politicize the virus and allow it to spread out of control.
27905,"Gotcha, I think the translation my browser did was just confusing."
27906,"So more like 100-200 deaths a day then - still a ton, but more in line with their population."
27907,"This article, like all others about NK, is terrible and still presents no evidence that NK has had COVID."
27908,"&gt; Meanwhile, the Kim Jong Un regime has denied having a single case of coronavirus despite testing thousands of suspected cases, a claim many [find hard](https://in.reuters.com/article/northkorea-southkorea/north-korea-berates-south-koreas-top-diplomat-for-doubt-over-zero-covid-19-cases-idINKBN28I386) to believe."
27909,"This is just a story about a SK diplomat expressing doubts, also with no evidence provided and NK pushing back on it."
27910,"&gt; In fact, earlier in March, South China Morning Post [reported](https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/east-asia/article/3074377/coronavirus-nearly-200-north-korea-soldiers-die-outbreak) about nearly 200 North Korean soldiers of dying from the coronavirus and thousands of others being quarantined, even as the leadership maintained the official stance of not being hit by the pandemic."
27911,"This is not a report by the SCMP, it's a syndicated piece that the SCMP published by Business Insider that is just rehashing a story by The Daily NK which, if you read between the lines, counts the number of soldiers that ""died of high fevers triggered by pneumonia, tuberculosis, asthma, and colds"" in January and February."
27912,"Given that seemingly NK itself didn't test those soldiers for COVID, it's impossible to determine whether they actually died of COVID but it's perfectly plausible that they died of a bad flu or other conventional winter illness."
27913,"So let's assume that NK had COVID imported into the country by March, well... what happened to it?"
27914,"Either you posit that COVID ripped through the country even worse than it's ripped through any other country and no intelligence service anywhere has been able to pick up the incredibly obvious sign of a mass COVID outbreak, or you posit that NK has managed to control COVID with tools far less sophisticated than every peer country or you go with the perfectly reasonable assumption that NK closed its borders early enough that COVID never had a chance to sneak in and it's continued that way til now."

28011,Overall I'd say they've done just as bad as the UK/US(when looking at deaths per capita as well).
28012,Admittedly they have since brought cases/deaths down and are right now doing better than the Uk but cases are still at rather high levels with averaging 14k+ cases a day and over 450 deaths on average a day.

28031,Can someone point me to definitive scientific proof that the mutation is more contagious?
28032,"The standard is 21 (or 28) +/- 4 days, so that's fine."
28033,"If it was outside the recommended range, I'm assuming they'd reschedule you"
28034,We don‚Äôt even have that for full dose.
28035,We do have P2 data that shows a 50ug response is nearly identical to the full 100ug dose.
28036,100ug was selected for P3 because they wanted to be super conservative.
28037,"There was a time, when i worked as a line cook, that i would get home around 2am, grab a beer, some blow, and go nuts for a few hours on COD: Black Ops with a shotgun."
28038,I can totally see some people doing the same in quarantine...

28041,You brits are way overdue for a revolution
28042, Came to say exactly this.
28043,That's due to snot blocking the way.
28044,Covid can attack the cells that are responsible for your sense of smell and swell the surrounding tissue.
28045,Regrowing those cells and nerves can take months
28046,I worked with some incredibly smart people at a Fortune 500 company who have fallen for trump and his complete shitshow.
28047,Just baffles me.
28048,Well if Mitch would fork over the 2k we could change that...
28049,and i suppose downvoting it fortifies your meaning
28050,SARS didn't infect and spread asymptomatically so it was very easy to monitor and contain.
28051,"If you caught it your ass was in the ICU by the time you started shedding it 

MERs is actually still a thing a few people contract every year"
28052,Some State's National Guard are all ready running drive thru test sites and getting prepared for vaccine roll outs.
28053,These type of missions are ran by the state because this wasn't declared a national state of emergency.
28054,If your state isnt utilizing the National Guard that is because you probably have a poor Governor.
28055,So what about Singapore?
28056,Thry are very dense.
28057,And Japan is even more dense.
28058,Whoops your entire theory just went out the window.
28059,Social distancing isn't that hard mate.
28060,"And if you can't social distance like on the metro, wearing a mask properly and sanitizing and washing your hands help."
28061,Are people's hands spritzed with sanitizer before entering shops?
28062,Are their tempetatures checked?
28063,Do people wear masks everywhere outside?
28064,All these things add up.
28065,Idk why you're still arguing about the obvious failure.
28066,All the countries that complied have seen elimination  of the virus.
28067,"Those who clearly didn't, haven't."
28068,It's that simple.
28069,Not gonna argue this point anymore.
28070,"Anyone that doesn't follow the simple guidelines of mask wearing, social distancing and sanitizing just doesn't want the virus gone."
28071,Simple.
28072,Yeah thanks Zeus.. and whatever podcast he goes on tomorrow he'll say 2022 and that will he headline
28073,"&gt;There's not enough, but currently it's more of a deployment problem than a supply problem."
28074,No way.
28075,The supply problem is really bad too.
28076,"Fauci says that, because of the very high transmissibility, maybe 90% of Americans need to be vaccinated to reach herd immunity."
28077,"That's over 300 million doses, or 600 million for the two dose vaccine."
28078,"How many are there today, 20 million?"
28079,There's a supply problem.
28080,"At the local drive-thru vaccination site, they just tell you to go park in the lot and wait 20 minutes."
28081,"Once the 20 mins is over they come ask you how you‚Äôre feeling, and if you‚Äôre fine, they send you on your way."
28082,No one is ‚Äúwatching‚Äù you the whole time so the staffing requirement is fairly low.
28083,3 or 4 weeks to a second dose was probably picked to run the trials faster.
28084,"If you wait 2-3 months, you're adding another couple of months to the trials."
28085,https://connect.trialscope.com/studies/6b7d56e0-2887-46d1-b639-1e6a5fb26b7d?pv=1
28086,The issue is the vaccine will take time.
28087,The vaccine can help to slow deaths.
28088,But it is not really know how it does to slow spread.
28089,"(from what I read) 

So in the meantime before everyone is vaccinated, people will still get covid and die."
28090,And remember...
28091,The vaccine does not treat covid and does not bring the dead back alive.
28092,Yeah just wait till Ducey wins the senate race in 2022.
28093,Then who knows who the hell our next Governor will be.

28099,"That‚Äôs a summary;  this is the full study I‚Äôm referring to:  https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)32661-1/fulltext

Specifically, the outcomes section, where they define what efficacy means for the study:

&gt;	Outcomes

&gt;	The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine against NAAT-confirmed COVID-19."
28100,"The primary outcome was virologically confirmed, symptomatic COVID-19, defined as a NAAT-positive swab combined with at least one qualifying symptom (fever ‚â•37¬∑8¬∞C, cough, shortness of breath, or anosmia or ageusia)."
28101,"They're out there showing symptoms much earlier in the infection, with a much much much higher IFR, and dying out with little to no intervention."
28102,It's weird that deaths were at zero though.
28103,The daily rates are all over the place.
28104,"The big problem with this article is we're not getting any hard information on why there are delays, just speculation."
28105,Where the heck is the data?
28106,where‚Äôd you get that $5?
28107,"The state health department said that WAS NOT a backlog, a real number"
28108,"tl;dr: ""Don't fuck with the approved dosing schedule!"""
28109,I think there are counties in Colorado that probably get one tourist every decade or so.
28110,"Geographically, almost half the state is on the plains and mind as well be Kansas"
28111,[deleted]
28112,"If no one else got COVID19 after I posted this message, I think the total death count would still exceed 500,000, between those who are already infected and on that path and those who are currently just counted as excess deaths not yet attributed to COVID."
28113,A lot of nurses go through without the science background as there are a lot of programs that focus more on clinical.
28114,So you have a lot of middle care providers that are excellent at carrying out good clinical procedure but lacking if they are presented with a problem to solve on their own.
28115,"Yes sir, it is cause both the UK and AZ have large boomer aged population who just really dont care about much other then their own lives, hence brexit."
28116,Its a common saying in AZ.
28117,"And the toledo one, I dont think that needs any explanation, you have seen Toledo."
28118,They also may suffer from thinking their judgement is superior to others.
28119,It‚Äôs a problem with some experts.
28120,Sounds very similar to Nazi Germany.
28121,Those that are a scourge on society should die?
28122,You are a moron.
28123,Momma always said life was like a box of Covid.
28124,"Generally 4 years undergrad, 4 years pharmacy school, pass boards, 1-2 years if residency is becoming more common after that as well."
28125,"Based on his age, he probably graduated back in the late 90s when things were a lot more lax and there was a pharmacist shortage."
28126,Mine is scheduled 17 days after my first.
28127,Should I wait a few more days before getting the second dose?
28128,"Unfortunately, many of them are still willing to hop on a plane after lying about testing positive or throw frat parties."
28129,Analysis Paralysis is a similar term used in engineering.
28130,Sometimes you get so caught up in making something perfect in every which way that you end up with nothing.
28131,Often times you just need to *do*.
28132,We can‚Äôt get caught up in being 100% fair and equal and perfect that we end up with slow and inefficient vaccinations.
28133,Would be so much simpler and easier if front line health workers and those 65+ could get it right now.
28134,Boom.
28135,"Sign up by age online, good to go"
28136,"Yes, the sky is falling!"
28137,"Nothing can save us!1!1

28138,"Attitude reflects leadership here, it would seem."
28139,My current operating theory is the ball starts rolling from mental illness.
28140,"After that, a stark lack of critical thinking and devout intellectual laziness just keeps the wave of misinformation moving."
28141,"That, or you'd have the cleanest and most organized house this side of the Mississippi."
28142,My family member manages CVSs and a lot of his pharmacists are refusing to get vaccinations.
28143,It kinda blew my mind
28144,I actually quit weed 2 months ago during this time!
28145,"I've smoked weed every day all day pretty much since i was 14, at work and everything."
28146,"One day i just quit cold Turkey and im pretty proud of myself :) I'm much happier,  and much more productive and MUCH more fit!"
28147,"The most recent reported cases were over 17,000 for the day, yet deaths were at zero."
28148,"The state either had a delay in counting cases, or the daily death rate is about to explode this week."
28149,Narrator: *They didn't listen.
28150,*
28151,Thanks for the reminder about immunity testing.
28152,Of course I assumed antibody testing.
28153,It's not perfect but it's a damn lot better than no information.
28154,"It's easy to say why you want the vaccine and not the real thing: an alarmingly high proportion of cases, including asymptomatic cases, are showing signs of permanent organ damage, including brain damage (e.g., widely reported attention deficit disorders, olfactory disorders, others)."
28155,"Then of course there's the chance of dying, or being sicker than you ever have been in your life for a long time."
28156,Is there really any debate?
28157,This is a disease you never want to get.
28158,It's Russian roulette.
28159,So what you're saying is that alot of people are saying...  *makes Trump hand gestures*
28160,My in laws were affected.
28161,A brother of theirs died from it.
28162,"So while I come home from work after being in the units, stripping and sanitizing to shower to not infect my family... And my in laws are saying, ""It's all just a hoax, it wasn't that bad, I'm asking my doctor for a mask exemption."""
28163,*twitch*
28164,If most of us thought that this would be over by summer 2020 then most of are clueless.
28165,Its a paradox in healthcare right now.
28166,Super short staffed but there's no money in the budget to hire anyone new.
28167,"People keep raging on about the hospitals making so much money this year, in all actuality they are probably hemorrhaging money."
28168,"No elective surgeries to make capital, tons of severely ill patients racking up literal millions on vents and ECMO for long periods of time, and many passing, leaving the bill to be picked up by the hospital or state."
28169,I've already seen posts about already short staffed labs looking at cutting employees loose or closing due to the years financial stress.
28170,"There's more to it then population density you're omitting initial border closings to China and emergency measures were taken a whole 4 weeks earlier in HK, Taiwan, SK and Japan."
28171,Also NZ never had the Italian variant that caused the exponential growth in the first wave.
28172,You can be sure that if Auckland had contact with the UK strain it would grow despite the lockdowns once it's endemic.
28173,"Has a cough, has a sneeze, now you have a deadly disease!"
28174,A man living in a town upstate who has no travel history.
28175,Just like most of the cases so far in other states with no travel history
28176,[deleted]
28177,No one asked me.
28178,There is no relationship between needing a vaccine and number of covid cases.
28179,"New Zealand has no cases of covid, yet has bought millions of doses of covid vaccine."
28180,Why is it strange that North Korea is doing the same?
28181,IANAL ...
28182,"I don't think it would work, but a class action civil suit would be amusing."
28183,"true - but i think ""conspiracy theorist"" is another way of saying mentally/emotionally ill. you have to be to buy into that bullshit."
28184,mental illness can overpower anything
28185,"EMTs and Paramedics have been declaring death for many, many years."
28186,"Usually protocols include things that are not compatible with life, such as decapitation, evisceration, etc, but also things like rigor mortis and dependent lividity."
28187,"Honestly, field folks see some of the worst stuff, since ERs aren't dealing with massive fatal traumas, CPR in a room full of family or body recoveries in an advanced stage of decomposition."
28188,"I'm only a volunteer firefighter, but in 11 years I've seen dozens of deaths and done CPR more times than I can count, quite often on cases I knew had little chance of any kind of survival."
28189,"In 11 years, I've had one CPR patient leave the hospital."
28190,I've personally made the decision to assume death in an accident where extrication would have taken hours and the mechanism of injury would have been nigh unsurvivable.
28191,"I'm not saying that we should be placing undue burdens on EMT's, but it comes off a bit patronizing to think that it is a new thing for us."
28192,This is how the vaccines are being distributed.
28193,Every dose sent out means that a second dose will be sent out specifically for that in two weeks
28194,those don‚Äôt qualify in health care setting
28195,I hope Cuomo has a bunker to recede to.
28196,It‚Äôs fall or bust.
28197,All the doom scrollers and the covid will rule our lives forever types are the clear minority.
28198,Options for this year:  1) we beat it or 2) we give up.
28199,Reality is usually somewhere between two extremes.
28200,"Has covid changed life forever, yes."
28201,Of course.
28202,"Did it turn us into hermits that slap on a mask any time we venture off our property, no."
28203,Of course not.
28204,Just take a look around.
28205,You‚Äôre telling me we‚Äôre keeping this up for more than this year?
28206,If this isn‚Äôt solved by fall you‚Äôll see many people adopt the Scott Atlas strategy.
28207,It‚Äôs the first I‚Äôve heard about anyone doing it.
28208,"But, it doesn‚Äôt seem that any of the states you‚Äôve listed are doing anything spectacular - there are only four states who have managed to inject more than 50% of the dosages they‚Äôve been allotted and none are the states you‚Äôve listed."
28209,"So even if they are trying, they aren‚Äôt doing a very good job."
28210,[removed]
28211,Except they're only banning it as takeaway from pubs.
28212,You can still go to your liquor store or grocery store and buy enough for your party.
28213,I don't see how this does a thing except hurts businesses that are already hurting.
28214,I‚Äôm personally trying to not really think about a date so as to not get too set on it.
28215,"I‚Äôm generally assuming that I‚Äôm be able to eat indoors at a restaurant with my friends without a mask by the end of the summer but otherwise, trying to not focus on it until we get more people vaccinated."
28216,I‚Äôm not sure my mental health can take it!
28217,I‚Äôm really curious about things like really large events.
28218,"Concerts, festivals, Broadway, that sort of thing."
28219,I‚Äôm also not really planning for any sort of major travel until end of 2021 at the earliest.
28220,Just my own personal estimates here.
28221,The article says: Because all they have is Sinovac currently and they don't have conclusive data on older people.
28222,"&gt;...as soon as they get theirs, they're hosting a swingers fest."
28223,Kind of like the [AIDS cure?
28224,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxjyg5dTx6k)
28225,You must be dense.
28226,"""Variant not affected by lockdowns"" means that there was something open in the ""lockdown"" still driving the spread."
28227,Schools.
28228,Schools were still open in November.
28229,Use your head.
28230,me too.
28231,The sharks are getting into a frenzy after we thought they were calm
28232,Right.
28233,Like it needs to be improved but Jesus the media acts like it‚Äôs all over and we‚Äôre done now
28234,Overdosing on Vitamin D requires taking much more than these supplements provide.
28235,"Many people in the United States, especially those with darker skin and during the winter time, are not Vitamin D sufficient."
28236,[https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/vitamin-d-deficiency-united-states/](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/vitamin-d-deficiency-united-states/)
28237,90% effective when the 2 doses are correctly applied
28238,If the French won't vaccinate they'll just have to remain permanently in France and their neighbours will have to build a wall.

28253,Hopefully things are way better by then.

28259,But I'll be downvoted for going against the narrative despite this.
28260,Refer to my username

28269,"&gt;the issue is people NOT listening to Merkel

People don't listen to leaders."
28270,They watch them.
28271,Moon is at a healthy weight and wears a mask in public.
28272,"Koreans follow Moon's example, hence 19 deaths per million."
28273,"Merkel pigs out, gets fat and leaves home without wearing a mask."
28274,"Germans follow Merkel's poor example, hence the 425 deaths per million."

28280,"Your body is perfectly capable of absorbing and using vitamin D from man produced sources, though it usually takes a few weeks to convert into usable form."
28281,"That's why it's likely that taking vitamin D once presenting full blown COVID-19 won't matter, as you won't be able to appreciably change all the issues a deficiency causes before the viral infection resolves."
28282,I didn‚Äôt even think about that.
28283,Veterinary.
28284,I wanted to be a DVM so I worked as a tech in high school and college.
28285,I decided it wasn‚Äôt for me.

28287,"This year there was a lot of people getting it, it was out of stock only a few days after the vaccination campaign rollout, pharmacies had no doses at all"
28288,There are multiple governors that have been talking about - and doing it - for weeks.
28289,"North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania already have theirs and are just being held up by the administration's slow distribution/lack of information."
28290,The only reason it seems novel is that Florida seems to just now be realizing what a lot of other states have been working on for a while.
28291,"Funny enough, Seoul and Toronto have basically the same weather except summer in Seoul is much worse lol"
28292,Story of my life
28293,"Globally yes, domestically it was more around 600,000-700,000 out of a population of about 104 million."
28294,About 0.625% of the population of the USA at the time would‚Äôve died to this.
28295,"Covid is currently sitting at having killed just over 352,000 (definitely higher if you count excess mortality) out of a population of about 330 million, or a bit over .1% of the population."
28296,"So for now, Spanish flu was about 6 times deadlier per capita, but this pandemic isn‚Äôt over."
28297,In order to reach a death rate like Spanish flu with our modern population covid would need to kill just over 2 million Americans which is a horrific thought but as bad as things are they *probably* will not get *that* bad.

28312,But it‚Äôs been amazing to watch how the goal post has been moving further and further since March of last year.
28313,By spring... by summer... by fall... by winter... by next spring... next summer... spring... summer.. now this fall.
28314,For real.
28315,"Would take awhile to find all those articles, but that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs been."
28316,"I get it, have to go by data, and it keeps getting worse, but it also reaches a point where this type of conditioning could have detrimental effects on the psyche of average citizens."
28317,I‚Äôm not a psychologist.
28318,Maybe one could chime in what this type of moving the bar over and over does to someone and if there‚Äôs a name for it.
28319,I‚Äôm curious.
28320,"We (NSW, Australian) had a lockdown in the beginning  then have lived as normal once it fizzled out."
28321,"So did a number of other countries, it must be a difference in attitude amongst the public."
28322,Are people following the advice where you are and staying away from other people?
28323,"Worldwide, but only 675,000 for the US."
28324,That's over a span of about 2-5 years too.
28325,For reference the US is currently about 11 months into COVID-19 and has lost officially a bit over 350k people and more likely 400k people (when you look at excess deaths similar to how we have to measure spanish flu deaths).
28326,So in 50% of the time COVID-19 has caused about 60-75% of the same deaths as spanish flu in the US.
28327,One big difference though is that back in 1918 there were about 1/3 less Americans total.
28328,So the impact of spanish flu was a lot higher and felt by more people (it would be impossible to ignore the dead bodies and field hospitals).
28329,But give us 2-3 more years of COVID-19 and a failed or failing vaccine rollout and we might well join them...
28330,"I wish we could go back and not have Internet, or that Fox News/ radio shows that perpetuate lies could be declared the equivalent of shouting fire in a movie theater and silenced."
28331,"With this, Q a non being elected to Congress, republicans defending Trump‚Äôs election behavior, I am so torn up and worried for my country."
28332,Iceland is not that great TBH is mostly low end stuff.
28333,They do stock 'Slimming World' items which makes dieting easier.
28334,but we only have a cuisinart!
28335,My guess is that his appeal to the COVID deniers will fall on deaf ears.
28336,I'm really happy that Belgium has become such a huge hub of the biotech industry.
28337,"The French-speaking region of Belgium is known for being the less economically developed region of Belgium, but in some areas we're world leaders."
28338,That's something to be proud of.
28339,I have high hopes for the J&amp;J vaccine.
28340,"AstraZeneca might not get approved as quickly as I had hoped (if it ever gets approved in the EU), but J&amp;J seems to have done a much better job at conducting their study, and the EU has ordered a lot of doses from them."
28341,Fingers crossed.
28342,In a few weeks we might have 3 vaccines approved.
28343,This is the type of quality info I come to Reddit for üòÇ
28344,This headline is misleading nowhere in the article does it say alcohol deliveries are stopping just takeaway alcohol
28345,Behold the miracle of exponential spread.
28346,Humans are still not used to this.
28347,They‚Äôre still thinking linearly.
28348,"With a population of 330 million, and America can't yet do 1 million per day, things will not be normal by fall."
28349,You've spent more time bitching than it would have taken to just provide a link.
28350,Sounds a lot like someone that is talking outta their ass.
28351,"I'm sorry I'm not really up to date with the American vaccine program, I live in the UK."
28352,"But I do agree with your final point, that seems like basic logic that should certainly have been implemented."
28353,I think someone should find out where this idiot went to school.
28354,He obviously missed a few classes.
28355,not if I catch Covid and die before then it wont.
28356,Right now were all adrift at sea in shark infested waters waiting for that rescue boat that showed up to pick us up....Waiting for our turn....
28357,"I do, I‚Äôm in France, where do I call to get mine?"
28358,I know.
28359,But most of the hospitalizations are in the same group - the very sick and the very old.
28360,Hospitals aren't clogged with 30-somethings.
28361,Then you have all the other people dying from other causes when the hospitals are overrun.
28362,This is largely uncharted territory only because its Tue first global pandemic we've faced with the ability to do broad scale genetic testing.
28363,"Viruses mutate, and with billions of infections it will go quickly."
28364,"The fact that it is being labelled as the ""UK variant"" isn't even fair."
28365,Without being able to trace patient zero we only know it spread in the UK.
28366,It could have come from somewhere else and spread rapidly in the UK during a few super-spreader events.
28367,"The UK has been doing much more genetic testing that most other countries, the variant could have already been in many places but they found it first because they looked."
28368,"We need to keep an eye on this variant, particularly how it responds to the current vaccines, but we can't stop the world from spinning every time the virus mutates."
28369,"Protecting those most at risk is still a moral priority, and non-pharmaceutical interventions are still important like they were before."
28370,So... the rich
28371,Ahem.....I think US should be doing this.
28372,[deleted]
28373,Interesting approach.
28374,I‚Äôm curious to see how it works out.
28375,"Oh yea, one or two people do the work and the rest goof around."
28376,Conspiracies involving large numbers of people are inherently flawed and impossible to keep silent.
28377,"Human nature, being what it is, makes it really hard to keep secrets."

28381,"The economic effect of Brexit will pale in comparison to the coronavirus, it probably won't even be noticeable."
28382,Could use some feedback.
28383,I have a friend who is planning on getting married at the end of July 2021 and requesting that hotels and such be booked soon.
28384,Since COVID has started I‚Äôve been a complete shut in and extremely cautious.
28385,"With the vaccine, my hope is that things will be better by then, but who really knows and who knows if a substantial amount of people will be vaccinated by then (doesn‚Äôt seem like it so far)."
28386,"That said, assuming pacing picks up with vaccinations and we start to see cases go down, do you think it is ok for me to plan to attend this wedding?"
28387,It feels like it could be irresponsible but some of the recent news with vaccines also gives me hope that I might be able to plan to attend.
28388,Welcome all thought
28389,"Affected*

28400,You get so close to the answer but miss it.
28401,A one week strict lockdown will do absolutely nothing.
28402,A one month lockdown exactly the same as the one week will do significant work in reducing the R number.
28403,What is the only variable in the equation?
28404,I‚Äôll tell you: length of lockdown...
28405,I wonder whether the people will take this.
28406,Locked inside their houses except for work for months.
28407,Maybe they will at some point realize that they are being treated like gulag prisoners while the government does fuck all?
28408,"By now there could literally be antigen testing done at every workplace and any other place where people meet, daily."
28409,"Find the infected, isolate, rinse and repeat."
28410,"But that would require effort and moneym So instead, people are treated like cattle."
28411,It's about time for an uprising.
28412,"If people tolerate this, they can just throw democracy in the bin, as it doesn't make any sense with zero accountability of the leaders."
28413,Yah that is the most frustrating thing.
28414,Just get them out as fast as possible.
28415,Clearly the hospitals are doing a shitty job.
28416,I‚Äôve got some bad news for you if you think that we are ever straight up eradicating Covid-19.
28417,There are *some* emergency situations where hospitals might put patients on beds in hallways.
28418,"As an example, I know somebody who had to have surgery for a broken hip during a major snowstorm."
28419,"The only hospital in the area which was capable of doing the surgery was over-capacity with other people who were injured in accidents related to the snowstorm, so their bed sat on the side of a hallway with many other patients."
28420,"However, I expect that hospitals would try extra hard to avoid doing so during a respiratory illness epidemic."
28421,"(There was also an article in this sub from a hospital near Los Angeles week or two ago where they *did* have COVID patients in chairs in the waiting room because there were no beds, but the staff were handling it so professionally that the video of the scene didn't *look* like sheer chaos.)"
28422,"Also for a lot of the patients in the situation above, I suspect most of them didn't need as frequent interaction with the nurses once their slipping-on-ice or car-accident injuries were stabilized."
28423,"From what I've heard, we should expect to see a higher rate of death for COVID patients now as compared to a few weeks ago because there are so many patients that the staff can't check on them as frequently as in the normal standard of care."
28424,These articles are always so deeply flawed because the writer doesn't define what normal means.
28425,Do I think there'll be increased mask usage in hospital for a long time to come?
28426,Sure.
28427,But that'd count as 'never normal' in that article.
28428,Do I think I'll be sat watching sold-out sports games in a bar in fall?
28429,Absolutely.
28430,That's pretty much normal for most.
28431,"Me too, I truly can‚Äôt wait to get to the end of this pandemic."
28432,All the best to you and your family!
28433,[deleted]
28434,Agreed.
28435,"Instead of doing whatever it takes to get those vaccines to the vulnerable, elderly and health care workers, they're talking about doing an extreme China style lockdown now to get the cases down while completely obliterating any economy that's left."
28436,"Oh yeah, they're also working hard to prevent any politicians from travelling abroad to escape the lockdowns."
28437,Lol.
28438,What a joke.
28439,"It's beyond embarrassing , it's just sad and disturbing how badly they fucked up."
28440,At least the USA is doing amazing at vaccine distribution.
28441,Unsurprising but also crappy.
28442,Even worse that there‚Äôs only 1 of 5000 tests for it.
28443,"Paradoxically, We‚Äôd be a lot better off if it were already widespread."
28444,"Hopefully, this is the last time the goal posts will be moved to reach normalcy."
28445,WHAT?
28446,?
28447,"We're hitting 500,000 a day now."
28448,It will be up to a million a day soon.
28449,Is anyone surprised?
28450,60-82 million by Dec 10 and there's been an additional 5 million confirmed cases since then.
28451,"It's possible we've hit 100,000 or a relatively close."
28452,"I get what you‚Äôre saying that 70% more transmissible doesn‚Äôt mean masks are useless now and that we definitely should still be wearing them as we have, but I think it‚Äôs a good question."
28453,Does that 70% mean more transmissible through air as upon exhale it‚Äôs more ‚Äúpotent‚Äù in the air or are the particles a different size or is it simply just making transmission rates spike up for some reason not mentioned?
28454,"NPR reported
&gt; However, as a result of Brandenburg's tampering, health care workers were forced to discard about 570 doses of the potentially life-saving medicine."
28455,Hospital officials said 57 individuals did receive injections of what may have been useless doses.
28456,"Those patients have been notified and are not at any risk of adverse health effects, hospital officials said on Friday."

28469,"It‚Äôs so ironically funny that I‚Äôm closer to a vaccine than I have ever been, in fact, my fianc√© has half her first shot, however, I am also the closest to covid I have been during this entire lockdown."

28471,Next week: SA strain found...
28472,"I get what you‚Äôre saying and I don‚Äôt necessarily think Newsom/CA has been doing things ‚Äúright‚Äù, but they introduced restrictions in CA because the healthcare system, especially in LA, is absolutely fucking slammed."

28480,We just don't know yet whether b.1.1.7 is associated with necrotizing thrombosis *years* after recovery.
28481,"I mean literally, we don't know that at all, but it's concerning so we should follow the science."
28482,States literally lack the funds and resources to handle a project this vast.
28483,"This was always going to need a national plan and funding to work, and of course, that wasn't going to happen, so now we're screwed."
28484,"And for all the handwringing about who 'deserved' it first, we forgot the fundamental fact that any needle in an arm means one less person spreading Covid in the world."
28485,"The longer we spend arguing this hogwash meritocracy debate, the longer Covid exists in the world, the more it mutates, and the more likely it is we can't beat it."
28486,"Reading of the new strands developing in South Africa and England, it's clear we are truly, truly, *fucked*."
28487,Too much time has been lost.
28488,"Hopefully, by the time the next Once-in-a-Hundred-Years Plague comes, we won't still have a two and a half month lame-duck government period written in law."
28489,The US has an incredibly fucked up relationship with government.
28490,The lack of trust (not unwarranted) seems to make reaching any social consensus difficult.
28491,Worth considering also is that NZ doesn't have any Murdoch media to fuck up discourse and locking down is much easier when people's livelihoods are relatively guaranteed.
28492,"Actually, I'm overwhelmed by your patronizing tone, creative logic and dogged support of the unsupportable."
28493,"""Fauci said that there is data to support recommending two doses within 21 days from moderna and 28 days for Pfizer."""
28494,That statement is so impossibly imprecise that it can't be contradicted.
28495,"To then draw life-and-death conclusions from it is, simply, intellectually dishonest."
28496,"Having friends who work within the civil service, a lot of advice that is being passed to the top brass is not the advice they want to hear which is the issue."
28497,"So going by that, it could be said much of the dithering is time being spent on the top having their minds/attitudes being brought round to Solutions."
28498,"But of course they need to juggle economy, health and future so quite frankly even tho they are making an absolute mess of it , it‚Äôs not something I would ever want to be involved in for the stress alone."
28499,"&gt;Treading a middle way between public health and the economy, as the UK has tried to do since March, is a half-measure that protected neither."
28500,"It is like trying to keep a motorway open after a pile-up and hoping drivers can swerve to avoid the debris, rather than shutting the road and clearing it so traffic can flow normally."
28501,Further collisions simply produce more debris and casualties.

28509,&gt; it is illegal to use a drug in a manner inconsistent with it's certification.

28727,This is a more tricky topic as there is some debate regarding the significance of persistent positive pcr after known infection.
28728,It may not be representative of active infection or risk of transmission in that context and can lead to repeated unhelpful testing and prolonged time off work.
28729,Our local health department (while ultimately deferring to individual hospitals and their own policies) no longer recommends confirmatory negative testing before return to work.
28730,They just require a minimum of 10days post symptom onset and the resolution of concerning symptoms.
28731,If still sick of course we are encouraged to continue to isolate beyond the initial time period.
28732,This approach is a bit nerve wracking for some on the first few days of return...
28733,Especially if there is still some minor lingering cough or fatigue which is common.

28997,"I didn‚Äôt downvote you, for what it‚Äôs worth."
28998,At least two people in our FDA have said they want to use the vaccines as approved (two full doses) for a few reasons.
28999,One of the reasons has to do with data they have seen from the trials.
29000,There simply isn‚Äôt enough data to predict whether or not the body was able to sustain the immunological response from one dose because there were too few participants and the participants who got one dose were not tracked for long.
29001,"Not only does the FDA not want to experiment on the public, they are concerned about damaging vaccination efforts."
29002,"Where would the resistance to ‚Äúmaybe/hopefully good enough‚Äù come from, you might ask."
29003,The American public was asked to radically alter our lives over for the last year to slow the spread while a vaccine was being developed.
29004,"We had reservations about a rushed effort, but we were told we should trust the process."
29005,We were told it would all be worth it.
29006,Some of us did exactly what we were asked to do.
29007,"Now that there is talk of watering down the vaccine in some kind of mass experiment on people who are not rich, not well connected, healthy 18-55 year olds."
29008,Well... that feels like a betrayal.
29009,Why should I risk long covid?
29010,"I mean, I don‚Äôt run every day to keep my formerly fat ass in shape only to be thrown to the covid wolves now."
29011,"If expediency trumps safety and a sense of security (*knowing* the efficacy as based on available evidence), then I guarantee you an even larger number of the American people will opt out."

29073,The normal ‚Äúanti-vax‚Äù movement is very much anti-science.
29074,They obviously aren‚Äôt for the covid vaccine either.
29075,"However, there are many more people that aren‚Äôt against say the MMR vaccine, but are skeptical of the covid vaccine -hence articles like this about healthcare workers declining it."
29076,Why?
29077,"Some of it is political -some on the right feel the virus is largely a hoax anyway so why vaccinate for it, some on the left listened to months of news anchors berating Trump and saying that any vaccine that would come out within a year would be rushed/untested."
29078,Some of it is simply people who have really looked at the data and based on their age group/health think it‚Äôs highly unlikely they‚Äôll die from covid so why take any risk even if it‚Äôs small with the vaccine.
29079,Some of it is also likely people who have had covid and recovered (particularly with healthcare workers due to their exposure levels) and believe their immune and either want others to have access first or again think that even a minimal safety risk from a vaccine isn‚Äôt worth it if they‚Äôre already immune.
29080,"Some of it is also likely people that understand science, but understand that MRNA vaccines are new technology and are skeptical of long term health effects that may not have been uncovered in the short trials that have been done -and while long term effects are rare and typically show quickly with traditional vaccines, that may or may not be the case with MRNA vaccines."
29081,I‚Äôm personally going to get the vaccine but I at least understand some of the above lines of thinking -and I think it‚Äôs disingenuous to state that anyone declining or considering declining the vaccine ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt believe in science‚Äù.
29082,I also think plenty of those groups could be persuaded with the right messaging in a pro-vaccine campaign.
29083,"There will probably be a number of strains circulating at any one time (this is after all the problem why we never bothered coming up with a cold vaccine; too many different strains and variations of strains); is it possible to have a mixture of vaccines, bundled up in one shot?"
29084,Don‚Äôt know how you test for safety of that...
29085,Can we stop calling them conspiracy ‚Äòtheorists‚Äô already?
29086,"A theory is a well substantiated, evidence based, and thoroughly examined explanation of things we observe."
29087,Conspiracy hallucinator would be more fitting.
29088,"All evidence suggests that re-infection is extremely rare, so immunity from infection should speed up the process of getting to herd immunity."
29089,"Vaccinating people who have already been infected reduces the benefit of this somewhat, but trying to determine who has or hasn't had the virus is too logistically difficult and would slow down distribution even further."
29090,I think there are still a significant number of cases (probably more than half) which are not getting tested and hence not being recorded as cases.
29091,"Probably a lot more are being caught than in the fall, though."
29092,Estimates from a month ago suggest that about 60 to 80 million people in the US have had the virus (https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2020/12/10/almost-one-in-five-americans-may-have-been-infected-with-covid-19).

29168,"you know what the plane looks like, and you know what it does and roughly how it works."
29169,but you do not know what parts it is made out of.
29170,"so you take it apart and use the parts to build it again, trying over and over again until you get something that's identical to the plane you had in the first place."
29171,the point is to find out what parts it is made out of and how they work together.
29172,"Also China is a one party system, so they don‚Äôt have to deal with republicans obstructing everything."
29173,"As someone who typically lives alone (in a houseshare but not necessarily friends with my housemates), I am sick of how few people are taking the mental health side of this all seriously."
29174,People need things to keep occupied i.e.
29175,"the gym, sitting in the same room for months on end is disgustingly damaging but most people don't give a shit."
29176,I honestly have crossed over into the 'cure is worse than the disease' side of the argument.
29177,"Economy will be wrecked for decades to come, society is not going to magically fix itself with a vaccine (which is not even guaranteed to work in the long run)."
29178,Do I want people to die because of NHS collapse?
29179,Of course not.
29180,Do I think more death and suffering will happen in the decades to come because of lockdowns?
29181,Yes.
29182,People only focus on what they can see.
29183,"They can't see mental health, they can't see the economy collapsing."
29184,I don't see myself sticking around the UK much longer once this is over.
29185,"Future is bleak for this country, can't imagine bringing up kids here and affording any real estate."
29186,The go-to for that is Twisted Tea.
29187,"It's got what racists, antimaskers, and other propagandized people need."
29188,"There is extra lag currently due to Christmas holidays, so it is too early to make any conclusions one way or the other."
29189,We need to wait some more for better data.
29190,It‚Äôs the trying to prioritize certain groups slows it down.
29191,Just open it up to whoever wants it and go for the highest number vaccinated.
29192,His instructor told his class 'off the record' if the victim is clearly dead and the head isn't quite a full foot from the body to give it a little kick so they could declare the victim on scene.
29193,You're right; I did mean to say 60-90 credit hours.
29194,Exact multiplier for unconfirmed infections is close to 5 based on recent CDC numbers.
29195,Our first responders and healthcare workers see it happening though.
29196,And they have been watching people party in the streets while their patients keep dying.
29197,A huge percentage of nurses and physicians will have PTSD as a result.
29198,And that sucks because we are going to need them.
29199,Dying from Covid is only a small part of what is happening.
29200,We already know that Covid can lead to chronic health problems.
29201,"Cardiovascular complications, progressive pulmonary fibrosis, brain fog that doesn‚Äôt get better, chronic exhaustion."
29202,There are going to be millions of patients that need treatment for these issues.
29203,The burden on our healthcare system isn‚Äôt going to let up even when everyone is vaccinated.
29204,Is the issue in France with distribution or supply?
29205,inb4 new super covid caused by half assed vaccine response
29206,"Because trump is still at the helm, and now that he‚Äôs lost the election he has no motivation to do anything."
29207,Also toxic masculinity
29208,All it takes is a little common sense at the tip of the spear.
29209,"Unfortunately, common sense is not too common."
29210,"well, effectiveness of masks during a surgery, is very high, in an operating room, where people waah rhere hands extremely thouroughly, and the surgeon Never touches the mask."
29211,"What we do in society, wearing masks, we in the netherlands had public tests with the regular masks, where it was proofen ineffective for most people, as the air just bypasses the mask, as in most cases it didmt fit the face well enough."
29212,"And we all touch the outside and inside of the mask often, and we dont take fresh masks often enough."
29213,"But even then, ofcourse, if it prevents spread even 0,5%  its at least a little bit, better then nothing."
29214,And i wear one too.
29215,"The idea that these regular masks prevent a virus coming out of you, is proven to be hardly the case."
29216,"But ok, we had to try something."
29217,"in the cases where the mask fits you well, it hekps a little."
29218,"But faces are not the same, on many faces, a cough just blew passt all the sides."
29219,"also, the cloth fabric lets virus particles through easily."
29220,"So in a sense, it was proofen that surgical masks and nurses masks, helped a little bit, with the right precautions."
29221,"if infecteded, you need to put the mask on after first having washed your hands, and only take it off when done meeting people, never touching your mask inbetween."
29222,i dont see people doing that.
29223,It happens.
29224,My office had a breakout in early November.
29225,Someone came to work while their spouse was home sick with COVID.
29226,About 20% of the company ended up testing positive for COVID within a week.
29227,The vast majority of the sick were women so I'm guessing a lot of the spread happened in the bathroom.
29228,It's a small office and all of the bathrooms are single person bathrooms so I'm guessing most people take their masks off  in there.
29229,Luckily I sit in the Server room which is on a completely separate HVAC loop than the rest of the building and is HEPA filtered.
29230,It also has it's own bathroom that only the System Admins like me have access to.
29231,So I wasn't affected personally.
29232,Probably doesn't know for sure but i guess if he's in the UK especially London then he's most likely got the new variant since I think the new variant is now pretty much dominant all over the UK
29233,"Will there be a report tomorrow, seeing as it is a holiday?"
29234,We already have close to 40% of Americans who have had Covid.
29235,"If we only did tests before vaccinations, we would be at herd immunity quite quickly."
29236,I swear to god Reddit wants this virus to win.
29237,Always just welp gonna go back into hiding sounds like this won..
29238,"The UK variant is already here, it‚Äôs been spotted in several states"
29239,Did you read the article?
29240,&gt;The situation in Los Angeles County hospitals is so critical that ambulance crews have been advised to cut back on their use of oxygen and to not bring to hospitals patients who have **virtually no chance of survival.
29241,**
29242,No that's just simply not true.
29243,Saying he's changing it when new science is available is not the same as changing because he wants people to follow policies.
29244,Like if he dedicated himself to a strick date and it turned out to be wrong.
29245,You'd still try to discredit him.
29246,You're basically putting him in an impossible situation.
29247,They need to completely quarantine that country no one in or out and they need to stop all world wide airline travel.
29248,All planes need to be grounded world wide.
29249,"That's good to hear, but within a couple of weeks Belgium, like many smaller European countries now starting mass vaccination campaigns, will be supply-constrained."
29250,"We need the Moderna and AZ Vaccines as soon as possible, along with increased production for Europe of already approved vaccines."
29251,"Maybe this would make sense early on in the pandemic, when the vaccine is a long way off, but what about now, when the vaccine is only a few months away?"
29252,"It seems like in the best case scenario, it would get to zero cases around the time the vaccine is widely available, and hence the disease is no longer a threat."
29253,So you end up making a ton of sacrifices to eliminate a problem just in time for it to no longer be a problem.
29254,"Ideally you wouldn't want your life to be in the hands of some moron who doesn't feel any sense of moral responsibility to not infect their patients either, but I take your point."
29255,Their hands are somewhat tied in a crisis like this.
29256,"It's just another one of those infuriating situations where society doesn't just actively protect people for being selfish morons, but rewards them for it as well.... then wonders why there's so many around."
29257,It‚Äôll be a version of Contagion where Jude laws character is the president instead of a journalist
29258,Hey and so did Trump - it‚Äôs almost like your warmonger label was a bullshit distinction.
29259,2100 is my target.
29260,Most of the long haulers will be dead by then and we will have advanced vaccine development sufficiently to finally eradicate all coronavirus infections.
29261,"Yeah, crazy, right?"
29262,"[This isn‚Äôt the paper I read earlier, but it says basically the same thing, around 1 in 5](https://www.ons.gov.uk/news/statementsandletters/theprevalenceoflongcovidsymptomsandcovid19complications}"
29263,If he can get vaccines rolled out faster that will make a huge difference in terms of deaths/hospitalisations and will also prevent a horrific third wave.
29264,So i think he can make a major difference
29265,"There are a lot of people who are alive today but at one point had a heart attack or other medical emergency and were ""basically already dead."""
29266,Three people like that in my family alone.
29267,Why are people trying to downplay this disaster?
29268,Congrats now all the hospitals are closing lol
29269,"&gt;De novo genome assemblies assume no prior knowledge of the source DNA sequence length, layout or composition

You're just saying the same thing over again."
29270,You're still stating that they don't know what they are looking for and they are creating something new.
29271,How do they know that new thing actually exists in the world if they don't compare it to something that already exists in the world before they made it?
29272,This is why some Texas hospitals are offering $500 to employees who receive the vaccine.
29273,"They're already understaffed, so incentivise through reward rather than punishment."
29274,Never
29275,Our local hospital has been giving all its vaccines out that it receives.
29276,They have 6 hours to use it once it‚Äôs thawed out so they give it to folks who signed up and then open it up for any leftovers.
29277,ITT what the Reagan plutocrats wanted all along since 1980.
29278,A lot of them already I‚Äôd the virus
29279,"Then you have people telling him ""wow this guy is useless and doesn't know jackshit."
29280,"Replace him!"""
29281,There's something impossible about strong border controls ?
29282,Lol seriously
29283,Sounds good to me
29284,Should cram suicides in there too.
29285,One of the biggest killers of military vets in the US is themselves.
29286,I‚Äôm not worried about dying.
29287,I‚Äôm worried about having a life-long chronic illness.
29288,Death isn‚Äôt the only permanent outcome from getting Covid and you don‚Äôt have to be old for it to effect you.
29289,We still don‚Äôt know what it will cause in permanent damage to one‚Äôs cardiovascular and nervous systems.
29290,"On top of not wanting to be sick the rest of my life, I also can‚Äôt afford it."
29291,"Yes the lockdown has to be very strict, and it has to be done early in the outbreak."
29292,"This worked in a few areas, but not most of them."
29293,"And now, 10 months in, it is very hard to get people to do it."
29294,If the at-risk individuals are vaccinated then what does it matter if the non-dual individuals aren't?
29295,"Nothing selfish about it, just common sense."
29296,"If the vaccine is effective, then me not having the vaccine shouldn't have at outcome whatsoever for my grandmother that does have the vaccine."
29297,"Don't tell people to ""grow a pair of balls"" and inject themselves with something that's still under trial because of your own emotions."
29298,Let families decide for themselves how to handle it.
29299,If my at-risk grandparents want me to get a vaccine sure I'll get it.
29300,If my at-risk grandparents feel safe having the vaccine and don't care what I do then great I won't get it.
29301,I certainly give more of a shit about what my own family thinks than what your or anyone else's opinions on this matter are.
29302,&gt;e been told we need to use 75% of doses or face having to send some doses back to the state (no fines though).
29303,"&gt;  
&gt;We've vaccinated about half our staff and a good portion of other healthcare personnel within 2 weeks of having the drug."
29304,The other half of our staff doesn't want it.
29305,"&gt;  
&gt;We've used about 55% of our allocated vaccines."
29306,"Right no

&amp;#x200B;

50% staff volunteerism is pretty good."
29307,I am hearing many other hospitals are in the 20-35% range.
29308,"We've ruined trust in the whole system, serious scientists are talking about vaccine escape due to not achieving herd immunity."
29309,We may not be able to stop this for years until things get serious about getting people vaccinated in a short amount of time.
29310,"I would suck as an accountant,  I forgot to move the decimal"
29311,"China did everything they could to cover it up, for as long as they could."
29312,Laugh all you want.
29313,"This also broke on the heels of the draconian crackdown of Hong Kong, followed by mass military movements to the outskirts of the city."
29314,Guess we all just forgot about that though.
29315,"You are full of shit 

We had a drive through vaccination event in my city for people 65 and older 

People were told to pull forward and park for 15 minutes to make sure they didn‚Äôt have any reactions 

Most just left 

Don‚Äôt make it so fucking complicated"
29316,Most young and healthy people should not have access to the vaccines before most vulnerable people anyway.
29317,"There's obviously a host of exceptions, but just going by the overall numbers, I think you're getting pretty angry about a scenario that, if it even happens, shouldn't be a big deal by then."
29318,Oooo check out ‚ÄúThreads‚Äù.
29319,Made for TV BBC special from the 80s.
29320,"They really need to start going with a split/rationed approach in vaccine allocation:

50% - Hospitals, EMT, other medical front line (until they're done)

30% - National Guard - set up mass vaccination drive throughs that are open to anyone

20% - Retail pharmacies like Walmart, Costco, CVS, Walgreens

10% - Businesses."
29321,This could be interesting.
29322,I know many businesses that could work together to facilitate and even pay for staff to come administer doses to their workers.
29323,Didn‚Äôt they halt genociding all those mink?
29324,Lets be real no one is following lock down protocals.
29325,"Im sure people are still visiting family and friends, going to the store for anything not just necessties because they are bored."
29326,religious is so fucked up.
29327,go to see your god if that is your wish
29328,I don't even know what the fuck you're talking about.
29329,What bounties on dead American civilians?
29330,What does that have to do with the pandemic and Trump's dismantling of the pandemic response team?
29331,"Seriously, what the fuck are you talking about?"
29332,"Believe it or not, the US is not the center of the world."
29333,They're doing ours down at the Convention Center.
29334,I presume there will be a somewhat heavy police presence.
29335,"Cuomo already threatened some silly fines, so of course, more threats is going to help"
29336,When can we expect results on the vaccine and the SA variant?
29337,"In a lot of cases, it won't even cover one month's worth of health insurance"
29338,For dosing the wrong people or not dosing quickly enough?
29339,Hard to keep track of what he's up to.
29340,Just want to vent.
29341,"The Netherlands had a lockdown about a month ago and I've been feeling way more down since then, even though prospects of a new job loom around the corner and I can call a fantastic person my girlfriend now since then."
29342,But it just feels.. Monotone.
29343,"I try to exercise when I can, play new games with friends, call and/or meet my GF as she also spent her holidays with me."
29344,We spent Christmas with our parents and everyone's healthy luckily.
29345,But it just feels like a rut all the time.
29346,I am truly grateful for the good things but sometimes I think my world has become and will stay so super small.
29347,"Sorry, I know a lot of people have it way worse than I do."
29348,There is so much more to it than *I need to drink my starbucks at the starbucks.
29349,*  Asking people to never leave their home except to go to work or get groceries for 10 months is not a reasonable ask.
29350,By the end of this people will have given up a year and a half of their lives.
29351,That is certainly not just giving up Starbucks for a few weeks like we were first told.
29352,"He's been undeniably awful, but unfortunately I expect incompetence from him."
29353,I expect better out of our other elected officials though.
29354,"To the extent that people on the priority list haven't gotten the vaccine out of their own refusal, that's not his problem."
29355,We're at a point where rigidly sticking to the priority list will do us much more harm than good.
29356,&gt;We need to hold 50% of the vaccine in reserve.
29357,This is logistically inane.
29358,People are supposed to get the vaccines 3 weeks apart.
29359,You don't vaccinate a batch of people and hold the second dose back for 3 weeks waiting for them to come back because then you could only use a tiny percentage of your storage space at a time--you would have three weeks' of vaccines sitting there waiting at all times.
29360,The better option is to keep the vaccine going out the door and be constantly restocking.
29361,Biden Admin better resolve this toute suite.
29362,There have been studies that show between 4 and 15 times as many cases may exist than have been reported (see my comments upthread).
29363,"They eventually estimated that about 20% of the population was infected with H1N1 ""swine flu""."
29364,"In the US this would be 66 million people, compared to 21 million cases so far."
29365,Yep I'm all fresh out of fucks to give for people who blatantly flaunted the advice of medical professionals.
29366,Thank you.
29367,Louder for the people in the back!!
29368,!
29369,Post-viral fatigue is very real and can be serious.
29370,When I was in my early 20's I had a severe case of mononucleosis that made be bedridden for two weeks with an additional 2 weeks of severe symptoms once the virus was no longer present.
29371,The description of the patients below describes my experience eerily well.
29372,"&gt; Roughly 65% of respondents (2,454) reported experiencing symptoms for at least six months."
29373,"The most likely symptoms to persist after six months included fatigue, post-exertional malaise, cognitive dysfunction (‚Äúbrain fog‚Äù), neurological sensations, headaches, memory problems, insomnia, muscle aches, palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness/balance issues, and speech and language problems."
29374,"&gt; Nearly 86% of respondents experienced relapses, most commonly triggered by physical activity, stress, exercise and mental activity."
29375,"Recovery was so slow I assumed the changes were permanent, but in reality it took about 3 years to fully recover."
29376,"The brain fog was the absolute worst part, and it made me feel like I was brain-damaged."
29377,"I am not saying at all that this is the same mechanism as in COVID, but severe virus infections can leave the patient with long term recovery, long after the virus is gone."
29378,We may not know for years how these cases will turn out.
29379,What you‚Äôre implying goes against every single expert opinion thus far.
29380,There is no evidence that the vaccines will not work.
29381,"Data has not even been released yet, it is expected by the end of January."
29382,It is impossible for you to declare the vaccines are ineffective.
29383,"Secondly, vaccines aren‚Äôt suddenly rendered completely useless."
29384,"In a worst case scenario, the vaccine may be less effective but not 100% ineffective."
29385,The data isn‚Äôt even out yet.
29386,No sense in speaking in absolutes by saying it won‚Äôt work.
29387,"What if someone was previously positive, has antibodies and prefers to step aside?"
29388,"Americans don't give a shit about our veterans, or each other."
29389,[deleted]
29390,"Easily half, or more, of the population is not going to get the vaccine."
29391,So that cuts down the pool right there.

Essentially he is suggesting that the fastest way to stop the spread of COVID-19 is to vaccinate as many people as possible as fast as possible."
29394,There are people clamoring for the vaccination but don't have access to it yet.
29395,"He is not suggesting that the goal of vaccinating medical workers, those at risk, frontline workers, and the elderly should be de-prioritized."
29396,He is suggesting that infrastructure should be built around allowing the general public access to vaccines that are being stored instead of distributed as well.
29397,The article says that more vets have died in vet hospitals from covid than these recent wars.
29398,"which according to the article the department of defense lists the combined deaths of military from these wars is 6,756.  while covid deaths in VA hospitals only is at 6,772.

reading comprehension is really hard with this title."
29399,Just give out the fucking vaccine to whoever wants it.
29400,How can this be so hard?
29401,"If some idiot health care workers don't want the vaccine, then give it to people who do want it."
29402,For fucks sake.
29403,You can fire those health care workers later when this pandemic is over for being assholes.
29404,"Ugh, so much idiocy."

29417,"If she didn‚Äôt have to go to work, she wouldn‚Äôt have caught covid from her coworker."

29420,"Herd immunity will not work, it‚Äôs been proven for corona viruses as a whole that you don‚Äôt get long term natural immunity."
29421,Vaccines are being rolled out now so rather than ‚Äúmoving on‚Äù we just need to be patient a little bit longer and indirectly save more lives.
29422,You may have missed a word or two in the title.
29423,"World War 2 US combat deaths is around 407,000  
World War 1 US combat deaths is around 53,000

Coronavirus will likely surpass the WW2 number before it is fully under control."

29425,"If that happens, we will officially be members of the worstest generation."
29426,"They really aren't taught about chronic illness much in med school either, American healthcare has this very black-and-white view of illness where you're either ""sick and dying"" or ""better now""."

29429,"the podcast ""Sawbones"" has a pretty good episode about Hysteria from a few years back"
29430,I remember last month she specifically mentioned the Tuskegee study and the (sometimes very justified) skepticism of the medical field by black people as a reason why she wanted to very visibly receive the vaccination.
29431,Hopefully it helps.

29444,There must be a loophole somewhere if you sell masks or hygiene equipment because it was mostly buisness as usual
29445,There‚Äôs a stigma against using ex-‚Äúmilitary branch‚Äù because so many people take that to mean that they were kicked out or their separation from the military was dishonorable.
29446,"You won‚Äôt get many people who want to say they‚Äôre ex-Army, and NOBODY will say they‚Äôre an ex-Marine (stronger traditional link to avoiding the ‚Äúex‚Äù than most branches)."

29448,"Given Moderna and Pfizer  already rolled out millions of doses, I am sure these super rich CEOs will find a way to get one anyway if they really want it."

one thing for sure is their early numbers from january-march 2020 or so are doctored"

29739,You just copied and pasted the TOR guidelines as if I haven‚Äôt been mentioning it since my first post.

29751,"If people stop coming, they can drop the age to 75."
29752,It's absolutely insane that we simultaneously have a shortage of vaccines but can't find people to take them.
29753,Leave it to the government to screw up something so simple.
29754,Well said.

29760,It sounds like they just take them straight to the morgue.
29761,80 percent is pretty good.
29762,It should be 100 percent though but it's better then what they are doing in USA.
29763,In USA people are getting evicted.
29764,Businesses are closing permanently.
29765,The government fought for 6 months and in the end decided 600 dollars per person was sufficient to pay all debt for 6 months.
29766,"Maybe I missed it in the articles but it doesn‚Äôt seem to clarify whether those that survived, survived without neurological deficits."

29771,The first lockdown ended.
29772,That's why weeks later there was video of shoppers packing a street.
29773,Then another lockdown was implemented when cases started picking up again.
29774,I really don't see how it's that hard for you to grasp.
29775,It's really not that difficult.
29776,You get how time and calendars work?
29777,"Yeah, I know what you're saying, but it seems like a lot of these people were taught science and still reject it."
29778,It's actually a lot of higher educated people who become anti vaxx.
29779,Just look at that Pharmacist who destroyed the vaccine doses.
29780,They have post-grad science education and still end up believing conspiracy theories.
29781,then remove them from their position.
29782,"If you‚Äôre suggesting that they need to go through full blown safety and efficacy trials again (aka back to square one), I highly doubt it."
29783,It would be a minor alteration to the existing vaccine and the approval would be expedited.
29784,Someone else may know more.
29785,&gt; How are you expecting scientists to have measured and confirmed the speed that this particular variant was spreading before it even had a chance to emerge in noticable clusters of the population?
29786,"The same way people expect the Chinese scientists to declare human-to-human transmission instantly when the covid was first discovered, despite there being very little testing kits back in January."
29787,&gt; What some people are saying about China is immaterial.
29788,Of course it matters.
29789,"Since people blame China for delaying the declaration of human-to-human transmission for a couple of days, we should hold the same standard when it comes to the UK."
29790,What is wrong with that?
29791,I disagree with double standards.
29792,Yeah they needed to make commercials on TV with that corporate flat pastel art style and a ukulele with a woman in a soft voice telling everyone vaccines are safe!

29800,Bringing home an infectious disease you did nothing to prevent is a deal breaker...
29801,The potential long term effects of the vaccine are from making an immune response to the vaccine that hurts you.
29802,YOU WILL STILL MAKE AN IMMUNE RESPONSE TO THE VIRUS IF YOU CATCH IT NATURALLY.
29803,"All of the same potential side effects from the vaccine (aside from allergies to the components) are still in play if you get infected, but you‚Äôll also have the risks from catching the real virus to deal with on top of it."
29804,That's still millions of people.
29805,LA County has over 10 million people.
29806,The whole LA metro region has over 18 million people.
29807,26% of that is still more than the population of many states.
29808,"And based on my Facebook feed, they have lots and lots of co-morbidities."

29828,The botched roll out we are having now isn‚Äôt doing much to relieve the pressure.
29829,And frankly it‚Äôs only going to get worse as we move down the tiers to different kinds of essential workers being vaccinated.
29830,Have the national guard running it with vaccinations happening 24/7.
29831,If you want to do some prioritization send out mobile vaccine clinics to places like schools and nursing homes.
29832,But if a hospital hasn‚Äôt been able to vaccinate all its staff for any reason beyond supply issues at this point they need to have responsibility for vaccinations moved elsewhere.
29833,"When Everything these moron's say gets debunked, they just go to the only thing we can't know of yet, which is ''But what if it harmful in the long run''

29838,"**

**""It is neither the driver's nor any other staff's responsibility to monitor compliance with the recommendation,"" writes Swedish Public Transport in a press release."
29839,"**

The new advice means that people born in 2004 or earlier are recommended to use masks between 7-9 and 16-18 on weekdays when traveling by public transport."
29840,"According to Swedish public transport, those who travel by public transport are expected to keep their masks on throughout the journey and not take it off until they are outdoors."
29841,The mask can then be thrown in trash cans or rubbish bins as other rubbish.
29842,"**In the first instance, it is everyone's own responsibility** to bring a mask with CE marking, but the Public Health Agency urges local public transport authorities to provide such to travelers."
29843,"However, in V√§stra G√∂taland, Kronoberg, Kalmar or Sk√•ne, masks will not be available on buses, trams or trains, according to GT and Sydsvenskan."
29844,"Most likely, they will instead be able to pick up at the customer center upon presentation of a valid ticket."
29845,\- We have a continuous dialogue with the region's infection control doctors so that we handle it in an infection-proof way.
29846,"But it is a reason of several that we can not have a box with masks on a bus, we must be able to distribute them in an non-infectious way, says V√§sttrafik's CEO Lars Backstr√∂m to GT."

29858,Bribery works pretty often.
29859,It‚Äôs amazing how often people will go against their misgivings for a bonus.
29860,Especially if they‚Äôre underpaid.
29861,Some hospitals are doing the risk/reward calculations already.
29862,It‚Äôs cheaper for them to offer a $500-$1000 bonus to get staff vaccinated than have to hire temps and traveling staff to cover holes when their staff get sick or burn out.
29863,But I do think there‚Äôs a severe lack of efficient vaccine redistribution for refused doses.
29864,Half your staff refuses the doses you had reserved?

29878,"I mean, it definitely will take more than a middle school knowledge of DNA to understand the mechanisms behind how and why vaccines work and why they are safe."
29879,Currently the issue everywhere but Israel is they are not administering the shots they do have not that they have too few shots.
29880,This whole one dose vs 2 dose debate seems like a complete distraction from the issue at hand.

29899,You missed the forest for the trees there.
29900,If the lockdown is as you say then no the length of a lockdown will not reduce the R number.
29901,I laid out what a lockdown should be not what it was/is.
29902,A properly done lockdown would see a decreasing R number.
29903,You‚Äôre injecting elements that I did not assert into the argument.
29904,Look at New Zealand.
29905,The locked down hard and long.
29906,Their R number is now what?
29907,Obviously we aren‚Äôt going to reach an agreement on this but R number is not measured at a single point in time.
29908,Different windows of time during a lockdown will see a different R numbers.
29909,If you did a lockdown for one day you would not be able to calculate the R number for that day.
29910,If you lockdown for 5 days then you would apply the R number to that first day.
29911,If shops remain open and the virus continues to spread that is a different level of lockdown and a different conversation about R number than I thought we were having.
29912,One of my clients runs a big funeral home.

29954,"You literally said this:

&gt;There‚Äôs not really any age requirements as you move down

I don't see how that is true in any way when there are very obvious age ranges that can be vaccinated during each phase."

29965,"For any who are wanting the vaccine, look into local vaccination clinics and volunteer, often if you volunteer X amount of hours you may be eligible to receive the vaccination."
29966,Ridiculous take.
29967,Would love to know why not wanting a vaccine makes a bad healthcare employee and/or system.
29968,You were just saying the first case was in Italy.
29969,What's the big deal about signing up for an app?
29970,Get the second dose of the vaccine then delete the app.
29971,A vaccine could save your friend's life but he's made an app his hill to die on?
29972,That seems odd.

But actually working in medical devices myself, I can say one thing for sure."
29979,"If you have a medical product, vaccine, medication, etc."
29980,Don't use it outside of the scenario that has been tested.
29981,"If it was meant to be used as a single dose, it would've been tested at a single dose and the efficacy, side effects and duration studied on a single dose."

30034,&gt;Forcing them to use all of their stock is flirting with potential disaster.
30035,What disaster?
30036,The nominal reason to vaccinate health care workers early was to prevent the health care system from collapse.
30037,We're already there as far as that goes.

Speaking at the briefing, health minister Magnus Heunicke said that the more infectious B117 variant ‚Äúwill‚Äù become the dominant form of Covid-19 in Denmark."

30106,It's not battlefield triage.
30107,It's when a heart stops and cannot be restarted.
30108,The survival rate is like 0.1% or lower in the best of conditions.
30109,I sincerely hope you are right.
30110,I wonder how seasonal flu shots are tested under that assumption.
30111,New strains are included every year based off predictive epidemiological analyses but it would seem to me to be impossible to run full three stage safety and efficacy trials on these new variants during the influenza off season (not enough infection for statistical significance) or in prior seasons where the new strains weren‚Äôt yet in play.
30112,Would have certainly put a damper on right wing radio.
30113,At my facility they only have room to monitor 20 people inside a large ventilated tent where the vaccine is given.
30114,That puts a limit of 80 people per hour if they don't change things.
30115,Because of that the line to wait to get in to the tent is often 60-90 minutes long.
30116,"There is plenty of staff around to monitor but not enough space it seems, not sure why they have to use a tent at all instead of somewhere indoor at a major medical facility."
30117,"Yeah, we can get vaccinated at a hospital."

30145,"So if there's a body that's been decapitated, you might not be allowed to pronounce him/her dead, but you can very clearly state that their injuries are 'incompatible with life' because of the famously low likelihood of staying alive without a head (or body, depending on your perspective)."

30153,The hypocrisy is frustrating to say the least.
30154,An EMS system pre-pandemic is not transporting people who are found pulseless for an unknown amount of time and no resuscitatable heart rhythm.
30155,The guidelines literally say consult with base if TOR is not met.
30156,The survival of OOHA (even with rosc) is incredibly dismal on a good day pre-COVID.
30157,"This is because if your circulation TRULY arrests for any reason, you only have about 5 minutes at typical body temperature to get it going before your entire neurologic system starts to rapidly, and irreversibly, die."
30158,"The only exception is extreme hypothermia which extends the survival of the neuron out to 45 minutes in some cases (for example, neurologically intact survival of avalanche victims with hypothermia induced ventricular fibrillation being found, warmed, and shocked)."

30236,Doctors offices and other qualified facilities having trouble getting ‚Äúapproved‚Äù - at least in our region.
30237,"Was just talking with a member or our regional ‚Äúvirus taskforce‚Äù who learned that locally, less than 1/4 of the qualified facilities that have signed up to administer Covid vaccines (including doctors offices, a major University, Long Term Care facility and a major employer with 2k+ employees and their own internal health department) have been approved so far."
30238,"Basically, the only places that have been approved right now are hospitals, health departments and a few orgs that are vaccinating nursing home residents."
30239,"Now, I‚Äôm certain that‚Äôs not the only bottleneck, but it seemed pretty indicative of why things are going much, much slower than we‚Äôd planned."
30240,"First, there is no TB vaccine."
30241,"Second, this vaccine is not FDA approved."
30242,"Third, every healthcare worker is critical right now and a small but significant minority do not trust the vaccine."

30266,This is how it works with antibiotics so I can see the logical connection.
30267,That said viruses are different than bacteria and vaccines aren‚Äôt antibiotics so what applies to one doesn‚Äôt necessarily apply to the other.
30268,&gt; Masks on planes really should be a regular thing.
30269,"After this pandemic, I'm wearing a mask on planes from now on."

30271,"Influenza and other respiratory viruses are down this year due to increased vaccination rates and Covid mitigation efforts (masks,distancing,restrictions)."
30272,"According to the CDC, Influenza rates are down 98% this year in the states."
30273,This observation may indicate the need to continue mask wearing and social distancing even if we vaccinate 70% of the population to curb cases/deaths.
30274,Just relying on the vaccine alone may not be enough.
30275,Would everyone be happy to rely solely on the vaccine with no restrictions/masks and lose 100k people annually or continue mitigation efforts with a vaccine and only lose 10k people annually?
30276,"At some point, we are okay with a small subset of the population dying from Covid if it means the majority can live normally with no restrictions."
30277,We just have to find that threshold.
30278,The entire roll out process is fucked because of the trump administration's denial of the problem.
30279,"Remember trump it was not a problem, a Democrat hoax, fake news, then gets the virus and has taxpayer money help him, THEN says its no big deal... etc etc etc... it never would have been this bad if he had just taken it seriously."

30293,Or you could vaccinate both now with your two doses.
30294,Remember one dose has been shown to be almost as effective as two doses for the period that it was studied in Phase 3 trials.
30295,Which do you choose?
30296,"I definitely see what you're saying here, but I think the reason this story is more meaningful when framed this way is because of the way America views their soldiers and veterans specifically."
30297,Elected officials like to use soldiers as examples of model citizens who deserve to be protected at all costs for the sacrifices they made for our country.
30298,Unfortunately once veterans are no longer in the forces they're only used as PR pawns for politicians while many of them continue to struggle and not receive the help they need from the government they fought for.
30299,It shows that our government only cares about individuals while they're actively putting their lives on the line to push their agenda.

30305,"Om disgusted that everywhere isn't ready for the vaccine, the absolute silver bullet for the crisis."
30306,"And everyone just seems shocked once it arrived, with no plan to administer it."
30307,The same dude (Cuomo) threatening to fine hospitals fir not using vaccines is threatening to imprison Healthcare workers who give vaccines to unapproved people.
30308,Total Catch-22.
30309,You can still believe in science and do your job very well while not trusting the vaccine.
30310,I don't agree with that approach but it's a simple fact.
30311,The issue here is not having authorization and a plan/strategy from federal or state level to mass vaccinate at risk populations.
30312, I see no evidence of this as a general rule.
30313,"Most hospitals here require flu vaccinations as a condition of employment, and employees are not leaving in search of a hospital that will hire them without vaccination."
30314,"Short term, I think it's not likely that employees will be required to get the Covid vaccine."
30315,"Long term, I don't see it likely that hospitals will decide not to require it."
30316,"We have the ""Privatized Quarterly Profits At All Costs and We Really Do Mean All"" extremist models of both food production and health care to thank for this vast artificial vulnerability in our population."

30321,Quite a shameful display for both the Libs and PCs
30322,"&gt;""According to one of the government's scientific advisers, the reason for Matt Hancock's 'incredible worry' about the South African Covid-19 variant is that they are not as confident the vaccines will be as effective against it as they are for the UK's variant,"" ITV political editor Robert Peston said."
30323,"""Not as confident."""
30324,"All of this scare all over reddit today is because one person said they are ""not as confident."""
30325,The media must have needed some fear porn because of all of the vaccine news going around.
30326,Take tier 1B for example.
30327,It includes food and agriculture workers the vast majority of whom won‚Äôt have employee IDs how is someone‚Äôs employment in that sector going to be verified in any reasonable way?
30328,There is some evidence to suggest that it is about 50% more contagious (but not conclusive).
30329,It does not seem to have any differences in regards to symptoms or mortality.
30330,"Personally I know of 3,through my social circles which includes relatives in US and Greece ,another 6."
30331,Some refused to go to the hospital thinking they'll get through it.
30332,Nothing really helps once on ventilators you have 5-15% survival chance.
30333,The flu has many different strains and it mutates much faster than coronaviruses.
30334,"I bet you said that when it was 1000 deaths a day and they projected 3000, which is the current figure"
30335,Yes but it‚Äôs an amazing guitar pedal!
30336,It's not being considered
30337,Role models are for little kids.
30338,"Adults should know better than to look up to politicians, football players, or most anyone else."
30339,"&gt;Richard Lessells, an infectious disease expert at the KwaZulu-Natal Research Innovation and Sequencing Platform, which played a central role in identifying the variant known as 501Y.V2, said his understanding was that the comments were not based on any new data but on shared information."
30340,"One of these is at a site that is believed to be important for neutralising antibodies and is not found in another coronavirus variant discovered in Britain, Lessells said."
30341,"BioNTech chief executive Ugur Sahin said in an interview last week that his company‚Äôs vaccine, which uses messenger RNA to instruct the human immune system to fight the virus, should be able to protect against the British variant."
30342,I would say healthy under 45 and you really don't have much to worry about.
30343,I would not have guessed so many retired service people would have even been in the area.
30344,til
30345,"So if this South African strain *does* turn out to be somewhat resistent, it'd at worst just slow the momentum of herd immunity a little, and wouldn't require them to start again, altering the vaccine and manufacturing it all over?"
30346,[removed]
30347,"What's really stunning to me is how an illness that has a lot of the same symptoms as the flu, that can be written off by some as just having the sniffles, can be devastating to some and we have no idea why."
30348,"I know someone who's a bit overweight, chubby but otherwise ok, who's been struggling since they got COVID back in April, to the point they had to sell their business because they physically could not keep up with the work."
30349,"Meanwhile, people I know who are morbidly obese (think several hundred lbs overweight) coughed for a bit and were tired, but were otherwise fine."
30350,It‚Äôs hard to say.
30351,"You could be right, but for some reason we‚Äôve got a massive amount of people here in the medical community refusing."
30352,Our governor was on tv a few days ago saying the same thing.
30353,And he also said we aren‚Äôt holding them much longer for people who have access but are saying no.
30354,He said we will skip you and you‚Äôll not have the chance again for a while.
30355,It really bothers me we‚Äôve had vaccines for almost a month and they aren‚Äôt being used because they are destined for healthcare workers who won‚Äôt take them.
30356,It‚Äôs also not like Ohio is even following CDC guidelines.
30357,"Dewine is making it up as he goes, he just said teachers are next."
30358,"So if the governor doesn‚Äôt follow CDC guidelines, it‚Äôs probably not unreasonable to assume local health authorities aren‚Äôt following Dewine‚Äôs arbitrary guidelines either."
30359,They will get their second dose.
30360,We are saving dose 2s so the doses will necessarily only go to someone that has dose 1.
30361,We have a lot of approvals and we‚Äôre doing a lot better now compared to a crap ton of countries.
30362,Vaccine production is ONLY getting much better since we got off the holidays.
30363,That‚Äôs about the same number that *currently* has covid.
30364,I understand that but it's the only information currently available and it's not a good sign by any means.
30365,The 1968-69 pandemic?
30366,"The CDC estimates it killed around 100,000 in the [US](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1968-pandemic.html)."
30367,"Which would mean fewer deaths than covid which has killed over 350,000 in the US right now?"
30368,How did healthcare services cope under the 1968 pandemic though?
30369,Because that's also a reason as to why many countries have gone into lockdown to prevent their healthcare services from becoming overwhelmed since in some countries covid hospitalisations has or had surpassed hospitalisations back in March.
30370,Although not entirely sure if we'd have still done lockdowns had China not done it.
30371,Part of me assumes we may still have seen lockdowns like I doubt NZ would have acted much differently.

30406,Yes and that is assuming that each of those individuals actually does quarantine even if strict penalties were enforced.
30407,All it takes is one slip up in the quarantine process or one person not following the quarantine to cause an outbreak especially in a densely populated country like the UK.
30408,It happened in New Zealand too where you are lauding their response.

30474,Those people are dead and shouldn't be transported before the pandemic happened.

30516,Thank you I don't understand why people keep comparing us to Aus and NZ its not the same.

30536,"The more people that get the vaccine the more normal it will be seen, the more social pressure there will be, the more time to see that there aren't serious side effects."
30537,Some states are using the national guard.

30554,"If it turns out vaccine hesitancy has penetrated further than we think into normal healthy people we would have otherwise considered reasonable then we'd be running a real risk of alienating them further by simply dismissing them as the ""other"" like that but we all know that's not true... they're trailer park trolls who shop at walmart!"

30556,"What I'm saying though is that  ***if*** there are in fact variants with ""drifting"" epitopes (and the evidence is certainly pointing this way) then the available data may no longer fit!"
30557,It's not exactly my area of expertise but if I was in the USA and in any way vulnerable I would want a vaccination that covers as many epitopes as possible.
30558,A vaccination regime that incorporates 2 different spike vaccines is more likely to provide this than the same vaccine administered twice (there would still be an overlap of major epitopes).
30559,This is called [heterologous prime boost vaccination](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19500964/) and is what I think will be happening in the UK.

30605,"Cuomo says statewide they're getting 300,000 doses per week and he is trying to ramp up to 3700 distribution locations in the state including pharmacies and schools."
30606,Currently supply exceeds demand but he says demand will start to exceed supply once those centers are up and running.
30607,A single location doing 1000 a week or even 1000 a day is a small number if statewide it is 300k per week.
30608,Guess we'll see.

30613,"I don‚Äôt remember exactly how far I did it, but like I said it was far enough for me to tear up and sneeze."
30614,It's a little backwards.
30615,"Basically, people who are hypersensitive absorb more/notice patterns more, which leads to them developing high IQs."
30616,But it can backfire on you for a number of reasons.
30617,"One is what you mentioned, where you may begin identifying patterns that don't really exist."
30618,Another is that it is very stressful to live in a world where you think and process sensory information very differently from the people around you.
30619,"You can't understand how others cannot see or notice the things you see and notice, and it can be very frustrating to constantly be limited and held back by others."
30620,"At the same time, others don't take you seriously when you tell them ""I need X or Y, because I'm hypersensitive to smells/sounds/sensation/etc"", because they can't imagine that being true."
30621,No they have a very different type of leader (albeit still very shite) Boris is very different to Trump
30622,"In other news, I live in Ireland and the UK variant has moved from being 10% of cases to 25% today."
30623,It is rapidly taking over our country.
30624,"We have nearly got the same number of people in hospitals as we did during our first March peak, and the numbers in ICU and in hospitals have doubled since last week."
30625,"I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs entirely down to the new variant, but it is a very grim situation for us right now"
30626,Waaaaaay too many people say they had COVID in March.
30627,"Unless you are in New York, it seems unlikely all three had it."

30639,"The first case was found in Kansas, so in that sense the pandemic originated in the US?"
30640,"We really throw around ""expert"" a lot these days..."
30641, California is literally underwater.
30642,So there‚Äôs no way in hell this would work.
30643,Hospitals are DESPERATE for staff.
30644,This idealogical scenario just doesn‚Äôt pan out because you will never fire staff when you already having huge burnout and overworked staff.
30645,Asymptomatic just means you don't have symptoms.
30646,Carriers can still spread the virus through contact and lack of hygiene.
30647,Meanwhile in Denmark our prime minister just said that the current sequencing effort is not good enough and expects to have it ramped up so that every positive test is analyzed.
30648,That does not outweigh vaccinating 2x as many people and preventing all severe cases of covid in those that receive the vaccine.
30649,Reducing spread reduces the chance that the virus mutates.
30650,"At a single dose, the vaccine has ~70% efficacy compared to 95%."
30651,The best thing to do is vaccinate as many people with a single dose as quickly as possible and give the second one at a later date
30652,[removed]
30653,It says they distributed 95% of the vaccines they were sent.
30654,Good for them!
30655,Perhaps the places which can actually distribute the vaccines should be getting priority for new shipments.
30656,I just wonder who is planning this.
30657,"Hey, let's try to do 100k vaccinations a day but only release the vaccine to 5 places that have 1000 appointments per day..."
30658,Yes.
30659,A lot of them have been working while asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic in the hospital setting.
30660,They are that short on RN's right now.
30661,"The reason it gets compared to wars, tragedies, and other familiar causes of death is because ""350,000 dead Americans"" doesn't ruffle anyone's feathers anymore."
30662,"People see ""350,000"" and think, ""some."""
30663,"When you see ""more than [event that you were very pissed about]"" it puts it in perspective."
30664,&gt;This is just an outrage/clickbait article.
30665,Is that a bad thing?
30666,You're *supposed* to be outraged about this.
30667,"If everyone was actually outraged, they would take it more seriously, and we would have far less COVID spread."
30668,Sounds like what the virus would say ü§îü§îü§î
30669,"The bigger problem is on a day where they are administering 500 doses and might only give out 495, the fact that they have had 2500 delivered and don‚Äôt have the infrastructure to vaccinate 2500."
30670,Let‚Äôs not lose the forest for the trees here.
30671,The doses and maybe a small waste is of course a problem.
30672,The larger issue is that of all the vaccine that‚Äôs been delivered - California is actually doing a pretty good job administering 35%.
30673,"Other states are below 20%, and I believe Washington DC was like 2%."
30674,"Counting just healthcare workers and other hospital staff at around 20 million, roughly 6% of Americans have been given priority access to vaccines."
30675,My mistake.

30688,"Each one is different in its culture, movement of people, interaction with other countries, tourism, government, and the list goes on."
30689,I‚Äôm not saying that the UK could have reached the exact same outcome as New Zealand.
30690,"New Zealand acted early, took quite a big gamble, and its paid off."
30691,If vaccines weren‚Äôt possible (which was a big question back in March when they locked down so hard) they and other countries like Australia would be in a very difficult position right now.
30692,What I‚Äôm saying is that lockdowns can definitely work to drive down transmission so long as there is financial aid to help people and business.
30693,The problem the UK and many other European countries have is that they act too slowly and then because there is more community transmission they need to do a lot more.
30694,The UK would have had to drastically reduce overseas travel to be able to quarantine entrants and it would have been (or would be) much much harder than it has been for NZ.
30695,"Well this is one of the things that frustrates me about what they are saying, I guess they are taking a hard line that they won't say anything that isn't proven conclusively, and then erring on the side of caution on everything else."
30696,"Which makes sense from a scientific standpoint and to make sure people remain cautious, but this is what leads to people thinking they might be overstating the risk or avoiding giving any good news."

30718,Those baseless claims made by journalists trying to get hits on their websites turned out to be wrong?
30719,Color me shocked
30720,I wish I could confidently attribute the current spikes to the new variant.
30721,However there have been thousands of samples sequenced and only a handful of the new variant identified.
30722,The spike seems largely driven by people's behaviour.
30723,A more infectious strain has less of a dramatic impact when infections are already rampant.
30724,It can turn a borderline risky vs safe interaction into a dangerous one...
30725,"But if you were gonna have 500 people drinking and partying together, the old version is plenty."
30726,Is it normal to not report every day?
30727,"In Australia, its always 11am everyday, has been the entire pandemic."
30728,It wouldn‚Äôt be over.
30729,It would just slow the spread.
30730,The minute things open up again the spread will start again.
30731,The only thing that can end this pandemic is vaccines or herd immunity through people getting sick.
30732,Cases numbers will go down in the spring when more people have been vaccinated (or acquired natural immunity) and the weather gets warmer.
30733,The longer the restrictions go on without having any visible effect the less tolerant people become of them.
30734,"Eventually, the demand to ""get back to normal"" will be too great for the government to ignore."
30735,"Yea, but as I said, how is the number we produce vs administer relevant to whether half dosing is done?"
30736,If you half dose then the exact same number of shots are administered.
30737,"It‚Äôs not like they are putting half as much in the syringe, they are just not giving a second shot right away."
30738,I guess half dose is the wrong term - should maybe be single dose vs two dose?
30739,It seems those states have problems counting anything

30745,"/s, just in case."
30746,Maybe that would finally be enough to get those people to either flee the country or fight back with the excuse to use deadly violence against them in self-defense?

30748,"Since so many like to compare deaths from the coronavirus to deaths in wars, they really need to start comparing coronavirus deaths to Spanish Flu deaths."

30778,Today on pointless comparisons:

30782,"Hundreds of thousands of civilians died, though."

30787,"The vaccines that is, not the old people."
30788,"While the headline is intended to make COVID seem deadly, as people assume that all wars have large numbers of deaths, anyone who knows better quickly realizes it is more about how few people we lost in two theaters of war."

30823,Suppose someone has COVID but is asymptomatic.
30824,Does the PCR test work as well for such a person?
30825,"If so, any source that says as much?"
30826,"A testing place is saying that if asymptomatic, the test will likely come back negative, even if the person is infected."
30827,"Arizona, California and Rhode Island."
30828,"But, they are counting reported cases rather than actual cases so it is possible that other states / countries have more cases but are testing less."
30829,Looking at this link on the CDC [dashboard ](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/fluvaxview/dashboard/vaccination-administered.html) does seem more people are getting vaccinated this year than last year so i imagine that's contributing quite abit to low flu numbers this year.
30830,Not to mention we know covid is highly infections especially with the new UK variant.
30831,So social distancing etc is probably more effective against the flu than covid.
30832,But i imagine if more are getting the flu shot this year that's going to help quite alot

30839,The only way to determine if a vaccine is effective is a trial that checks if it is.

30913,Most businesses that could do work at home are now doing it and have redone their policies and infrastructure to accommodate it.
30914,The workforce that has been working from home for almost a year is coming to terms with it and have modified their living around it as well.
30915,"There's no going back to brick and mortar for many, and since processes are already in place, a blended model will be the future for many."
30916,"It's one of the small, silver linings of the pandemic."
30917,"Good luck, stay safe."
30918,It seems like reinfection rates are incredibly low.
30919,People who have had it are not catching it again in any sort of significant way.
30920,(Right?)
30921,I know someone who had it in March and she had the antibodies test done at least twice.
30922,"By the fall, it showed her Level of antibodies was really low, to be almost nonexistent."
30923,"If the antibodies deplete, what exactly is preventing reinfection?"
30924,Welcome to the new America...die in the street if you're not a rich Republican.
30925,"&amp; he praised them for being ""transparent"", China's unwillingness to allow the rest of the world to investigate has made this pandemic so much worse."
30926,"Damn, as a white American I guess I missed the memo on our record wealth growth"
30927,The vaccine (moderna) was actually developed in 2 days due to the mRNA research.
30928,The rest of the time was testing.
30929,And they did take a short cut by running phase 2 in parallel with phase 1.
30930,That doesn't increase the risk for anyone now (did slightly increase the risk for the people in the phase 2 trials).
30931,I think if you understand how the vaccine was approved so quickly it helps.
30932,They pretend to be to try to control the behaviour of others.
30933,They are insane hypocrites who really just want the world to do as they say.
30934,"Young people die in wars, the coronavirus mostly just kills the old."
30935,That's why people care less.
30936,I can voice displeasure and not do it?
30937,I go to work with idiots who don‚Äôt know how to wear a mask and have also made it a point not to see anyone.
30938,My point is...gathering and partying is fueling the spread.
30939,You have a conscious choice not to be unsafe and if 10 months in you don‚Äôt know what that means then you probably need to reevaluate the flow of info you‚Äôre getting because clearly it‚Äôs not enough .
30940,I‚Äôm speaking generally and not aimed at you.
30941,But there‚Äôs a difference and people should know what causes spread.
30942,There‚Äôs a difference between being held accountable for doing the wrong thing and unfairly shamed.
30943,Maybe it's because the media controls how most people think in this country
30944,"Yes, but that's only folks who've been around for a while and only folks with lots of expensive education."
30945,The bulk of teachers coming in now don't make that and likely won't for a while.
30946,"They get half the year off yeah, but most of that is weekends and a lot of it is lesson planning, they actually work quite long hours."
30947,and idk like 50k maybe?
30948,Oh also don't use blow-dryers or any other tools that circulate air
30949,I am in Colorado and it appears they have a mandate for masks in public places.
30950,"The order requires people in Colorado who are 11 years and older to wear a covering over their noses and mouths:

    When entering or within any public indoor space."
30951,"While using or waiting to use public (buses, light-rail) or non-personal (taxis, car services, ride-shares) transportation services."
30952,Those exempt from wearing a mask have a medical condition or are under the age of 11.
30953,Seems like a Gray area in terms of worker protection.
30954,My assumption is that everyone I see is a potential carrier of COVID-19.
30955,"Yeah, I was all about the tiered system to make sure those who needed it most got it."
30956,But after reading this thread I‚Äôm really second guessing that.
30957,The vaccine rollout has been so disappointing.
30958,"My only caveat is that if they choose to just say anyone who wants one, can get one, that they someway, somehow, organize it."
30959,Because I have seen news stories already of people showing up en masse when a rumor circulated that there was a place they could get the vaccine.
30960,"I‚Äôm not completely sure what the solution would be, just as long as it‚Äôs not mass chaos lol."
30961,The point is that veterans have shit medical coverage and are often discarded by society.
30962,Veterans are dying from COVID because they have never been cherished and taken care of unless their name is on a wall somewhere.
30963,Same here...
30964,I had dry cough for one month followed by shortness of breath and fatigue.
30965,No other symptoms.
30966,All of this started mid March.
30967,And since then the shortness of breath has never left me...
30968,It has been up and down all the time... like a rollercoaster.
30969,I have been diagnosed with covid over the phone by a doctor in April...
30970,I never had a test because it was the beginning of the pandemic...
30971,It's been months now that I'm doing health checkups (chest x-ray/blood test/chest ct scan/breathing test...) but they all come back normal but I will have results in 2 days for the breathing test.
30972,But I don't feel normal.
30973,I had to reduce my hours at work (-10h) because I couldn't do it anymore.
30974,Even if I've reduced my hours I still struggle.
30975,I get so breathless if I walk or do any efforts :( I'm a gymnastics coach so I have to talk a LOT...
30976,"Imagine how I feel after a 7h shift... breathless for days :(

I feel that the SOB will never leave me and that it's now a part of me..."
30977,I never had breathing problems before.
30978,I'm a female of 29 years old without any health problems.
30979,I use to be really active before this... now I can barely do what I love without feeling out of breath :(
30980,The guy you're responding to knows perfectly well those (rational) guidelines were  misintepreted.
30981,"He knows perfectly well there's also a clinical trial into said ""mix matching""  not least because I and others have explained several times

https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/covid-vaccines-doses-uk-latest-b1767892.html

  it is a perfectly valid strategy for boosting strength and durability of immune response compared to giving both of the same doses , and has little to nothing do with supply

but he doesn't care about any of these facts, so you're waiting your time  he's just here to twist the facts and promote the narrative UK is being reckless and coin-flipping who gets what vaccine amongst other antics."
30982,"I see, indeed üëç"
30983,"No, the efficacy was 62.1% for the Oxford/AZ vaccine."
30984,"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)32661-1/fulltext  (Table 2, All SD/SD recipients)

‚ÄúLooking into‚Äù a single dose is a healthy exploration for additional clinical trials, and I hope we can someday show that we have a single dose vaccine that works."
30985,"But until we have actual study results and efficacy data, it is an irresponsible dosage regimen to use for the general public."
30986,This is what happens when idiots get played by the two party system in this country.
30987,They vote for whatever buffoon has an R or D next to their name.
30988,"I thought you were saying the mrna vaccine effectiveness was less vulnerable to spike protein mutations than traditional vaccines, but I haven't seen anything to suggest that."
30989,"1) At this point, available data shows that a majority of Americans are planning on taking a COVID vaccine."
30990,This # only increases.
30991,"There is no reason to believe, other than your refusal to believe available data, that we won't get a significant number of people vaccinated in the coming 6 months."
30992,2) This has been stated elsewhere: we don't need full herd immunity to begin to lift lockdown restrictions.
30993,It should be based on hospitalizations and capacity.
30994,Can someone with COVID just go by and shake their hands?
30995,Maybe give out a hug or 3?
30996,The virus is fake right?
30997,Lmao
30998,"I'm all for vaccines, but anaphylaxis is still life-threatening"
30999,"If that's the case, which I assumed it was, why wouldn't healthcare experts be saying this instead of saying they don't know?"
31000,No other vaccines are proven to be effective at stopping individuals from developing symptoms but not stopping them from spreading it.
31001,[removed]
31002,We aren't expecting to have everyone vaccinated anytime before the end of 2021 right?
31003,"and we're currently averaging at about 2,800 deaths a day, trending upwards, and we're real close to hitting full hospital capacity where every additional person who needs a ventilator just dies in stead."
31004,We'll probably close that 50K gap at about the end of January if not before.
31005,Takes me a moment to realise they aren't talking about Vets aka veterinarians
31006,&gt;The image of a black woman getting vaccinated is actually pretty powerful in that sense.
31007,"Yes, we agree it's powerful propaganda."
31008,She should know better than to get an injection and then *immediately* claim to everyone that she's somehow demonstrated its safety.
31009,We already know some people are susceptible to anaphylaxis and were warned to remain under observation for at least 15 minutes.
31010,I haven't seen a single vaccine line that was requiring people to remain under observation for 15 minutes...let alone the rest of the day.
31011,My children have nut allergies and even under direct supervision during clinical challenges they still tell us to monitor them carefully over the next 24 hours...
31012,Did they ever disprove the studies indicating BLM protests didn't lead to predicted spikes in transmission?

31015,"From my own little circle of friends, it's 50/50."
31016,And neither side seems likely to change.
31017,There's never gonna be some magical time where a sizeable number of healthcare workers are out because they're sick.
31018,"And if the vaccine doesn't prevent asymptomatic spread, it doesn't matter because they won't be working regardless."
31019,"When given an option, they always do."
31020,"Given enough time, and after having exhausted all wrong things, they sometimes settle on the right thing."

31036,Where people living or matter doesn't matter as long as they get their paid.
31037,Lower excess death than Covid death isn‚Äôt that unusual.
31038,It‚Äôs happened over the border in Norway and is happening in the UK right now.
31039,It‚Äôs explained in both by social distancing having reduced other forms of mortality.
31040,"For example other infectious diseases are also greatly reduced, lower air pollution leads to fewer pneumonia cases and there are fewer deaths due accidents like car crashes and alcohol poisoning."
31041,"Basically staying at home is quite safe, if boring and lonely."
31042,They have been around since the first vaccine existed.
31043,VA is a US term for hospitals for military veterans
31044,Wouldn't happen.
31045,"A small number of people get nasty allergic reactions to vaccines, so there needs to be a medical professional around for \~15 minutes after they get the injection."
31046,"Governments say things like this, and then they wonder why there's massive non-compliance."
31047,If they want people to follow covid guidance there needs to be a definitive end in sight.
31048,Life is not worth living if this goes on forever.
31049,So they do earn nearly 40k then?
31050,"How much do you think they should earn,  and they get half the year off dont they?"
31051,Right?
31052,Every other one was rejected by the fda.
31053,"his point is that vets encompass everyone who have served, whereas only those on active duty could have died in Iraq/Afghanistan"
31054,Japan said it before china even did.
31055,Thats even worse
31056,i think you're forgetting that the comparison is between hypotheticals.
31057,flu is lower than a normal year but covid is higher (mainly because it didn't exist before).
31058,if flu cases/deaths were cut by 80% this year (idk the real number) we can safely assume that covid would be 4x worse if there were no masks.
31059,My episodes were on and off for those 3 years and it really just came down to good days and bad days.
31060,"That, and I learned to take extra care of my health to give the good days every advantage."

31065,How many tests did UK last week?
31066,2 million tests?
31067,We had less testing during christmas/new year.

31086,"226, Even if we are extremely generous and say every one of those were preventable and round up to count deaths from other means to 300 deaths by police, Covid still killed over 166 times more black people than police did."

31102,"That option is preferred if the person is unlikely to return, according to the document, but it is not limited to that scenario."

31150,Antibodies by nature prevent the contraction of a disease and therefore it can be implied that less people carrying a communicable disease will spread less of it.

Wrt extended interval before boost, 21 days is not likely to be optimal, more likely to be optimal minimum."

 Every single covid vaccine manafacturer that actually bothered to test longer than 21 days, e.g AZ (12 weeks) , cansino, (21 days was less superior than 28, or 14, the only three tested) J&amp;J found longer intervals (8 weeks vs 4 weeks) were beneficial for enhanced immunogecity which jives with what we know about vaccines and immune responses  in general (hence why FDA/AICP) usually advises 4 weeks minimum"
31206,Even with that south African variant?
31207,"There's so much bullshit on the internet, its hard to tell whats real and whats exaggerated."
31208,"And even if it was vaccine related, it's stop incredibly low odds."
31209,Most homes are private.
31210,Good luck enforcing a lockdown order on a private business and the employees.
31211,We've already seen how well that worked.
31212,I did.
31213,What‚Äôs your point?
31214,Do you think 20% of hospital employees use flip phones?
31215,I cant believe people like this exist
31216,Do you think mr prez has anything to say about dying vets?..
31217,"oh, that's right, he's already showed his true colors about that"
31218,Will have to wait and see once the SA variant has been investigated further.
31219,"&gt; With the minutes ticking down, the medical team made the decision that the goal would be to inject every dose, regardless of state guidelines."
31220,"The medical team felt that ‚Äúthe more people we vaccinate just brings us closer to herd immunity,‚Äù said Winiger."
31221,This hospital did the right thing.
31222,It's not the hospital's job to track down every essential worker in the area and figure out which tier they are in.
31223,Just get the shots into arms.
31224,These people should be commended for not letting the vaccine go to waste.
31225,Maybe because many watch him from the distance.
31226,Sorry.
31227,It would still solve the problem of people camping out in cars overnight.

31229,"Ok, but 99% of reinfections clearly aren't being caught based on that incredibly strict definition."
31230,Both of those islands had very strict almost China like lockdowns.
31231,The half assed approach won‚Äôt work.
31232,The biggest factor is their age.

1."
31234,"About 15% of the population has received the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, \~50% of those aged 60 plus received it."
31235,2.
31236,The rate of vaccination is roughly 1.5% of the population daily.
31237,3.
31238,There are talks with both Pfizer and Moderna to receive a new vaccine shipment earlier than previously negotiated.
31239,4.
31240,The current Covid outbreak is severe and Israel is likely going into a full lockdown this week.
31241,"It's not that it's not being approved, it's that it can't file for approval until the Phase 3 trial in the US is done."
31242,I'm pretty sure they'd love to send it for approval right now if they could
31243,Didn't know honestly.
31244,I havent ready been paying attention outside of Israel is doing a good job and France getting barely anyone vaccinated.
31245,It's already hitting mainstream: https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/coronavirus-lab-escape-theory.html
31246,My parents are over 70 years old.
31247,They waited in line for hours only to be turned away by the Highway Patrol (everyone not inside the parking lot at the vaccine location had to leave).
31248,"When asking about how to wait in line if they couldn't wait on the shoulder, parents were told, ""A lot of people are camping out in the parking lot."""
31249,This is in the Panhandle.
31250,There are legitimately senior citizens sleeping outside to wait for the vaccine.
31251,No one seems to know how to coordinate jack shit around here.
31252,My own parents will probably end up getting vaccinated with the general public...whenever that may be.
31253,Saw our governor on TV acting incredulous that people were waiting overnight.
31254,He was almost defiant when questioned about it by the reporter.
31255,"He deflected by saying he ""couldn't control how the vaccine was distributed"" on the county level."
31256,"Just ignore Sweden then, which didn't lockdown and currently has one of the most deaths per capita."
31257,Just like Jesus would do
31258,That have been independently confirmed.
31259,And studied yes.
31260,And they have to be careful as the PCR test can test positive for up to a few months after infection.
31261,Which many of these reported reinfections likely are.
31262,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7486122/

31265,Please take care of yourself - even if that means ignoring your toxic family members.
31266,"Just curious, but if the vaccines work as well as what the trials indicated, then why did Boris shut the UK down for 6wks and maybe longer?"
31267,"I realize 1.3M people vaccinated over the last month or so is a drop in the bucket, but I'm curious as what the projections are in terms of # vaccinated by end of March."
31268,At what point should we start seeing cases and mortality decrease?
31269,Surely they have some projections for that based on vaccine rollout.
31270,"IDK, I was a bit surprised by the lockdown, but don't live there so don't know how bad it is."
31271,What are you talking about.
31272,"First,  allergic reaction and  adverse events are two very different things
 

Allergic reactions are usually pretty quick."
31273,And for all vaccinations the protocol is to have two types  of treatment available (usually epinephrine and injectable diphenhydramine).
31274,For all vaccines.
31275,"Ive seen people need the epipen because of a reaction to the glove (vaccine hadnt been given yet)
It is also something they watch out for in studies and are prepared for."
31276,Especially in the tens of thousands of people in this trial.
31277,"Also, yes people sit their asses in chairs."
31278,"Or in the case of the drive thru one by my house, they hold onto your insurance, or credit card until 15 minutes is up, and then give it back to you."
31279,Adverse events are studied nonstop.
31280,Down to years after a vaccine.
31281,We havent had that time unfortunately but do have several months of data.
31282,And everyone who gets a vaccine is supposed to sign into an app to record daily issues.
31283,If something severe happens then cdc will call you.
31284,"You know why the media shows people smiling saying, see its safe?"
31285,Because its a needle in the arm for half a second.
31286,You dont turn into a werewolf and people dont are excited and the protection it can give against a devastating virus.
31287,"Ok, drug trial exclusion criteria."
31288,The dont have people excluded with allergies.
31289,The exclude people who are allergic to ingredients in the vaccine.
31290,Its usually very specific.
31291,For the flu vaccine it would be an egg allergy.
31292,"(its grown in egg medium but then washed out during the process)

You dont ever give someone something they are explicitly allergic to."
31293,I really dont know what you are trying to say it wasnt meant to be deployed population wide.
31294,They are all meant for the the entire population .
31295,In cases where they dont have enough testing (under 16) then they dont have it available for use.
31296,"But they are studying it under 16, so its still intended for that population."
31297,"Im pretty sure the manufacturers know herd immunity, so again, what were you trying to say?"

31433,Our body has stress responses at the cellular level to prevent viral damage.
31434,It appears that they may not get turned off after the infection is contained and this may manifest as human disease later in life.

31446,"&gt;But Sky News and other media reporting were not at the centre of this new activity: instead, a ‚Äòvideo report‚Äô by Yemini (Figure 4) was heavily amplified by his followers and the broader community of hyperpartisan accounts that form the core interest group for fringe, far-right politics in the Australian Twittersphere."
31447,"&gt; This criticism centrally addresses the perceived bias of these journalists in reporting on the Victorian lockdown, and particularly in questions directed at Premier Andrews during his daily press conferences and in other appearances."

31466,"That data is for the secondary analysis, which only looks at cases that occurred 21 days after the first standard dose."
31467,"That data is muddy because many study participants received a second dose within that timeframe, so we can't really draw any conclusions about the efficacy of a single dose because many participants received two doses during that window."
31468,The study wasn't designed to evaluate the effects of a single dose.
31469,"They do break out the _hospitalizations_ data by first-or-second-dose timing in Table 5, and it appears that the vaccine reduces hospitalization likelihood beginning at ~10 days after the first dose."
31470,But they don't break out the data for symptomatic COVID-19 disease.
31471,I read that as asymptomatic people have as much virus in them as non (which would seem to suggest no difference in false negative between symptomatic and non).
31472,But does anyone have any citations on the claim that asymptomaticness leads to a higher chance of false negative?
31473,I can't find anything Googling around because I keep getting hits on whether asymptomatic people can spread covid (which of course they can).
31474,If we get another fucking spike ima cut my wrist or something
31475,"From an european point of view, seeing affirmations that ""Japan did nothing"" while Japan had under 5k new cases today seems really weird."

31480,&gt;how is the number we produce vs administer relevant to whether half dosing is done?
31481,There is absolutely no reason to half-dose unless the problem is a shortage of doses.

31483,"As there are potential drawbacks for half-dosing, if there is no reason, no reason at all to half-dose, then....wtf are you talking about?"

31557,The CDC estimates that between Feb and Sept only 1 in 7.2 infections were detected.
31558,"According to them, that means that on Oct 1st the US already had **91MM** infections."
31559,"Over three months later confirmed cases have risen enormously, and if the same ratio of cases to infections holds true, then the US has had almost 150MM infections by now."
31560,The WHO has estimated that close to a billion people have already been infected with only a handful of confirmed reinfections.
31561,This suggests that infection confers near 100% immunity from reinfection.
31562,All of this taken together suggest that 45% of the US population are already immune.

31596,They are not immune from covid restrictions fatigue and they shut it all down over so few cases....
31597,"From what I understand, science seems to think that it'll prevent people from being hospitalized."
31598,The vaccinated frontline worker or health care worker can still transmit the virus to vulnerable people when interacting with them if they acquire an infection after being vaccinated.
31599,There seems to be a lot of aggression and hostility towards people who have hesitations about the vaccine and I'm thinking it doesn't need to be that way because there isn't the evidence that it stops people from transmitting.
31600,"Honestly, this pandemic has stressed people out a lot."
31601,Do we need another massive fight about vaccinations?
31602,No.
31603,"I think we need to change the messaging to ""you don't HAVE to take the vaccine but it's available if you do and it can prevent you from being hospitalized if you get the virus."""
31604,This pro-vaccine movement seems to make it about protecting the common good...and we should have learned from the mask messaging fiasco in the spring that that message doesn't work.
31605,"I think we should tell the truth, give people a choice to protect *themselves*...I suspect it will be a more effective communication strategy."
31606,Don't threaten to fire people because the vaccine doesn't work that way...the vaccine seems to only protect the recipient and we should be focusing the messaging on that.
31607,Well what do you suggest they do?
31608,Let someone who‚Äôs got a shot at survival die while they continue to pound on the dead guy‚Äôs chest?
31609,The whole situation sucks all around but I really doubt there‚Äôs a better option at this point
31610,"The lockdown worked in Australia, NZ and Vietnam and they are mostly covid free now."
31611,But then those places had a sitricter lockdown.
31612,Lockdown works if people actually follow it.
31613,But when you're still allowing international travel well you're just asking for new cases to be imported into the country.
31614,Australia/NZ have closed their borders to tourists except it's own citizens and even then they have to force quarantine in a hotel before they're allowed to return home and mix with the general public almost ensuring they're covid free then.
31615,What else do you suggest we do if hospitals get overwhelmed?

31621,In general they seem very efficient.
31622,Yes lots of people are researching possible long term risks of the vaccine.
31623,Thanks to their hard work we now know that to the best of our current knowledge it appears completely safe.
31624,It is very different in different regions.
31625,Stockholm have been at a plateau since middle of November and it looks like it is finally getting better.
31626,Some regions still have hospitalization numbers that rise fast.

31630,white people gotta demonstrate their superiority tho
31631,Many are single dose.
31632,This is just shitty reasoning.
31633,The average age dying from this is way older than anyone working in healthcare
31634,"Harbinger of a strong middle class is density of vets needed to care for nascent pets, of course."
31635,States should set aside their doses for the target population (and needy populace like undocumented persons and the homeless) and have a parallel public dosage strategy.
31636,Make an online system where individuals can register to receive their vaccine during the week (and subsequent dose three weeks later).
31637,If you have increased need due to age or illness (indicated by a doctor entering information on the system and your driver license) you get more chances in the weekly lottery.
31638,You can easily protect people's medical privacy by only producing a number associated with the persons name and ID in the government database.
31639,"Then when you win the weekly lottery, you have a week to get a dose, and a dose it automatically set aside for you."
31640,That's the apple-bees-knees.
31641,In UK and Canada we decided to opt out of saving second doses for people

31645,And D614g.
31646,No reason to think that the vaccines won't work.
31647,So thinking about the 1.5 million people in the US that got Covid last week; if it was just 15% that would be 225000 people that will suffer from long haul just last week.

31651,"A longer incubation period would be horrible, curious if that effects shedding of the virus?"
31652,As in more shedding or for a prolonged amount of time.
31653,It is also specific to disease type.
31654,Many of the one dose vaccine are for bacterial diseases which inherently have a robust antibody response since it has many foreign epitopes.
31655,Most one dose vaccines are attenuated live virus vaccines so they weakly replicate post dose so one dose can become a second dose after a few day.
31656,A&amp;Z and J&amp;J are replication incompetent viral vector so that one dose is the only dose.

31683,"A gutter ball could mean a fatal medication error, unnecessary therapy, incorrect therapy, etc."
31684,Pharmacists are there to avoid gutter balls.
31685,"Now, many prescribers probably don't need the bumpers, but they're always there anyway."
31686,Imagine the average prescriber is as good as the average bowler.
31687,There's going to be gutter balls if there aren't bumpers.
31688,"Pharmacists do more than you probably realize, and it's only in rare cases where one my flat out refuse to dispense a prescription for a legitimate medical or legal reason."
31689,"Well I‚Äôm hopeful that because of the concerns, they already started the new strain vaccine and the countdown is already on"
31690,"The length of the lockdown is crucial, I agree and should indeed be long enough to have the in house transmission go down."
31691,"If the lockdown is sufficiently strict and transmission becomes almost exclusively possible inside the household the basic assumptions of the model break down and you would be right, but even the strictest lockdowns in Europe are somewhat transparent and have people visiting each other ""but we were super careful"".... Also many industries and so shops remain open and allow transmission between households."
31692,As long as households are not isolated (or almost isolated) I think the R number would still react almost immediately.
31693,Early in the lockdown you would have a lot of in house transmission.
31694,But without the restrictive measures you would have the in house transmissions + all the outside transmissions.
31695,The only difference is that at the start of the lockdown more people are infected.
31696,The chance of transmitting it to other people (under the condition that you are infected) does not change of your are not infected because R exclusively models the transmission by infected people.
31697,Or maybe people listened and more people stayed home than would have if you didn't have a spike.

31709,Yep.
31710,This is another colossal Trump administration failure to throw onto the mountain of failures.
31711,"Months of leadup about how a vaccine was getting closer to being developed, that it worked, that approval was right around the corner, and there was zero prep work about what to do when a vaccine was ready to go."
31712,This administration is the equivalent of waiting a week after an assignment is due to start looking at the assignment directions.
31713,There are a whole lot of tiny towns in the US that don't even have a population of 975 people.

31729,In the US about half of the population takes the flu vaccine which is about 150 million people over a few months.
31730,This is done at numerous places including local clinics like CVS or Walgreens.
31731,"However it still has to be administered by a trained nurse, not because the shot itself is hard to give (you can train someone to do that in 10 minutes) but in case there are any problems or reactions."
31732,Some places have been requiring a doctor to be present at Covid vaccinations in case of reactions but those restrictions are starting to be lifted.
31733,The US has the infrastructure to give 1-2 million shots per day if they can get it ramped up.
31734,They are even talking about setting up pop-up clinics in malls and schools.
31735,I understand that this is different in Europe and it is treated more of a medical thing often done only in doctor's offices.
31736,I just can't get my head around this.
31737,Just...how?
31738,What is going on with this conspiracy theory bullshit?
31739,If you get told by the emergency management agency ‚Äúno critical patients and there is an oxygen shortage‚Äù.
31740,You wouldn‚Äôt pick up critical patients or use transport oxygen.
31741,"You would do your best to triage but if there‚Äôs no hospitals willing to take your patient, you can‚Äôt take them."
31742,That‚Äôs where we are right now.
31743,"&gt; Xu Hejian, deputy director of Beijing‚Äôs publicity department, said some newly diagnosed COVID-19 patients had experienced longer incubation periods, as they tested positive for the first time more than 14 days after being exposed to the virus."
31744,"This development, he added, had prompted city authorities to implement stricter quarantine measures in a bid to prevent future outbreaks."
31745,How will you be 31 when the pandemic ends if you we're 28 when they found it?
31746,Covid19 was discovered December 2019 but didn't really reach the US till around March 2020 so it's only been affecting the US for just under a year right now.
31747,The pandemic will likely end this year since vaccines are here and as more vaccines get approved and logistical issues are sorted out the vaccination rates shoulf significantly pick up over the coming weeks and months.
31748,It's hard to calculate exactly how many people will need to be vaccinated especially with the new UK variant that is more transmissible so it may mean a higher amount of people will need to be vaccinated than previously thought.
31749,But even then once the elderly and vulnerable have been vaccinated we should see things start to improve as hospitalisations and deaths should then significantly fall
31750,In the US you get nothing.
31751,That call is way above the pay grade of EMS personnel.
31752,"They transport people to the people who practice medicine, they don't do it themselves."
31753,how long have we had the technology to do it.
31754,And in that time how many have cost enough that it's worth doing it.
31755,Covid19 exceeds that criteria with by $Trillions.
31756,This frickin country...
31757,Currently there is no reason to think that they won't work on both strains.
31758,"Nobody knows how long it would take to make a modified mRNA vaccine, but the majority of the time would be waiting for approval and production if some of the testing can be skipped."

31770,&gt; the initial dialogue from both CDC and WHO was that there was no proof of aerosol spread.
31771,You misunderstood.
31772,"They said the virus was not ""airborne"" which has a very specific scientific meaning and is correct."
31773,They never said it couldn't be aerosolized.
31774,Don't put words into their mouths.
31775,"OTOH, you still save a heap of people from getting a virus with some incidence of long term consequences, you save a heap of lives, _and_ you're locking down either way - the question is only how severe are you locking down, and for how long."
31776,"Potentially, a hard lockdown with the message ""we're going to eliminate this"" for 8 wks is easier to tolerate than ""we're in lockdown to slow the spread til past March"", as [they're telling](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/05/covid-lockdown-in-england-likely-in-place-until-march-gove-warns) UK citizens today."
31777,Due how they filled the equivalent of 18 hospitals in the past two weeks...
31778,"I agree with you, fwiw."
31779,It's a harder sell now that the vaccine+summer are on the (distant) horizon.

31782,I‚Äôd say we‚Äôve already accomplished that part already.
31783,Most hospitals should she already had vaccines sent to them to vaccinate staff.

31792,Another spike?
31793,"Dumb ass anti-mask idgits, packed gyms and bars, full malls; what the fuck do people expect to happen?"
31794,40% of the population or thereabouts still think this is all blown out of proportion still.
31795,Fuckin' embarrassing (kicks trash can).

31797,What some people are saying about China is immaterial.
31798,How are you expecting scientists to have measured and confirmed the speed that this particular variant was spreading before it even had a chance to emerge in noticable clusters of the population?
31799,He looks like Imahara but he's allready dead... RIP :(
31800,You cannot reason someone out of a position they did not reason themselves into.
31801,They will continue to monitor trial participants and give updates.
31802,Though those updates will take time.
31803,I would expect the next update around April when it is believed they will file for full FDA approval.
31804,And I've heard kids can be super spreaders since they don't show symptoms.
31805,So this is really stupid.
31806,It agree the sick time policy here in the US is terrible.

31813,Ok but where is the outrage at the hospital that left this complete nut job alone and in charge of the vaccine?
31814,"to add to your point, it is only 1-2% with proper care."
31815,"if you run out of beds/staff to provide proper care to those infected, that number will go up"
31816,&gt;How did they know the virus existed if they hadn't isolated it yet?
31817,they had isolated it.
31818,de novo assembly is used on something that's already been isolated.
31819,&gt;How do you do that with your mind?
31820,How do you trick yourself into believing something that you have no proof of and then keep tricking yourself despite someone pointing out that you have no proof?
31821,you're the one who doesn't want to change their perspective.
31822,"you said they created the virus, pointing to de novo assembly as proof, but you don't accept that you misunderstood what that actually is."
31823,"you said the vaccine contains the virus, which isn't the case."
31824,I‚Äôll take it for free.
31825,But this is the way.
31826,A lot of them already work 40+ hours a week so my family member has expressed that it's been hard to get enough pharmacists to volunteer to go around administering shots.
31827,I guess they make more than enough money already without putting themselves in risky situations which is understandable.
31828,it's ridiculous to think there's a conspiracy in my opinion.
31829,"But I still don't understand the two pharmacists that I know who don't want the shot themselves, I will never understand the thought process behind that"
31830,so seperate lets say 20-30% of the vaccines for them; and give the rest to everyone else.
31831,Agreed.
31832,I think any lockdown at this point is much more palatable now with the end in sight.

31866,The change was never made because of places worried about public image and outcry.
31867,(And also because there are so many places still practicing medicine based on science from the 90s and early 2000s).
31868,Not because it changes someone‚Äôs survival chances.
31869,The way people are reacting to this article is proof enough that the public freaks out over things like this.

31874,The problem with the vaccine is that the long term consequences are unclear.
31875,There literally has been no time to evaluate any long term effects.
31876,"Now mind you most of these concerns are bullshit, like ""it's gonna giv us cansur"" or ""DNA modification"", others are more reasonable."

31901,We are working on improving the filter as well.
31902,Well we don't know if vaccines can stop transmission.
31903,The most important thing is that we need to ensure that we have the health workers in work and not off sick with COVID so we can cope with demand as the virus continues to spread amongst the community.
31904,"It's also self reported, self diagnosed, and not peer reviewed."
31905,So the healthcare system has been collapsing for the last 7 months or so.

31927,Ok well I think root canals are a good proxy issue for vaccines and an example of where you need to step back and look at how these professions might have earned people's distrust.
31928,You can look at it in isolation and say that a netflix documentary has misrepresented the science around a well studied issue and a process that has been developed to be safe.
31929,OR you can step back and look at the context of a profession that for decades put high concentration mercury amalgam into people's mouths and see why they might have earned people's distrust.
31930,Maybe instead of calling them crazy we could have a frank and honest discussion about previous practices and substances used in root canals that we have addressed and improved.
31931,Can you even say with certainty that a root canal is the evidently preferable choice as opposed to a full extraction and implant?
31932,Cost has a lot to do with it.
31933,"If it's the cheaper option with acceptable compromises it needs to be represented as such, rather than cost benefit analysis decisions being made independent of the patient and them being told to shut up because they're not the expert."
31934,"The same needs to be done in medicine, we need to look broadly and investigate the sources of distrust in the first place."
31935,It clearly isn't just unfamiliarity if those who work within it day in and day out are just as or more likely to harbor the same feelings.
31936,some states have this registration/data collection in place.
31937,The lack of a federal approach is a colossal mistake though.

31940,"They're not doing it for the country, they're doing it for the people they're saving."
31941,Yeah its not just michigan either.
31942,And the cdc‚Äôs rollout phases say we have to get through all these people first before the general public can access the vaccine.
31943,Meanwhile millions of doses are going unused/expired.
31944,&gt; Sounds like the UK/SA strain is in AZ.
31945,Possible.
31946,"You spotlight whats leading the misguided attempt to change the manufacturer guidelines with dosing, the lack of proper logistics to get everyone vaccinated as soon as possible."
31947,"However, this does not make the problem addressed in the article any less critical."
31948,"It's like the saying ""Throw the baby out with the bathwater""."
31949,"We've seen how this type of short circuiting works, especially in the US, with massive lockdowns in the very beginning, then many states just saying they are open too fast."
31950,"If we maybe had a national response for an extra 2 weeks, it might have saved us the pain we are in now."
31951,"As for the logistics of getting that vaccine to everyone, why not tap Amazon or UPS?"
31952,They have perfected logistics and would do a million times better then any government.
31953,"So let me get this straight, 18,000 people a week are dying from COVID, and we have no comprehensive plan for vaccine distribution?"
31954,"The scientists pull off a medical miracle, developing an affective vaccine in 9 months, and we didn‚Äôt bother to develop a comprehensive implementation plan?"
31955,A racist troll at that
31956,"I thought the vaccine wasnt safe, i keep reading of ppl getting worse even after the second vaccine"
31957,Devils advocate here for you.
31958,I‚Äôm going to get the vaccine so let‚Äôs start with that.
31959,"I am also a scientist in an engineering field, so while not at all a doctor I‚Äôm certainly not incapable of understanding science and math/statistics/etc."
31960,"So while I‚Äôm not against the vaccine, I FULLY understand some of the concerns of people who are not going to get it -many of them reasonable, educated people."
31961,"Most I‚Äôve talked to have their normal vaccines and so do their children if they have them, they‚Äôre not your normal anti-vax crowd."
31962,Most of what I‚Äôve heard and can emphasize with is based on a kind of risk/benefit analysis.
31963,"None of the people I‚Äôve met/talked to against taking the vaccine are in high covid risk categories, mostly younger, healthy people."
31964,They‚Äôre looking at their risk of dying from covid and realizing it‚Äôs highly unlikely.
31965,"Then they‚Äôre looking at this vaccine, which like it or not was highly politicized by both sides of the spectrum (the right dismissing the virus, the left dismissing that a vaccine could be safely made in a year by the Trump admin)."
31966,"Moving past that part that muddles people‚Äôs opinions on it, you then have the actual hard science behind it."
31967,"MRNA vaccines are a new technology -yes they‚Äôve been around a decade or so in research settings, but they are brand new in terms of mass vaccination of humans."
31968,"I‚Äôm not going to pretend to be an expert on MRNA or even normal vaccines, because I‚Äôm certainly not."
31969,"However, I do understand that it‚Äôs very different."
31970,"So, when long-term side effects are brought up as a concern and people say ‚Äúwe know vaccine side effects show up early or not at all, so the shorter trial of the MRNA vaccine would have shown serious side effects if there were any‚Äù -to me I‚Äôm skeptical of that because it‚Äôs assuming new vaccine technology will be similar in that regard to the old technology."
31971,"May be true, may not, and I understand there is plenty of theory into why it *should* be that way - but it *is an assumption* until proven."
31972,"So people thinking about details like that, then looking and seeing ‚Äúoh my age group has a 99.97% chance of survival from covid?‚Äù I can understand why they may want to decline the vaccine."
31973,"&gt; Yesterday Die Zeit had an article about a hospital where patients have to share oxygen masks

31981,"However, since people are blaming China for doing this, then there is no reason why UK should be left off the hook."
31982,He just hates China by the looks of it.
31983,Hospital Admin here - our direction/mandate has been to vaccinate group 1A only.
31984,That includes only hospital staff and other healthcare personnel.
31985,We've been told we need to use 75% of doses or face having to send some doses back to the state (no fines though).
31986,We've vaccinated about half our staff and a good portion of other healthcare personnel within 2 weeks of having the drug.
31987,The other half of our staff doesn't want it.
31988,We've used about 55% of our allocated vaccines.
31989,"Right now, we don't have the authorization to go outside of group 1A and face punishment if we do."
31990,"We're anxiously awaiting and planning on how to mass vaccinate the 1B, at-risk population, as soon as we can."
31991,I understand EMS will try all lifesaving efforts even under these circumstances.
31992,"My point is that EMS is stretched thin, and even if they can get someone into an ambulance, there's AN HOURS LONG WAIT TO GET THE PATIENT INTO THE ER!"
31993,"And what about those ambulances waiting in line that are then unavailable to go out on other calls, at least some of which would otherwise be lifesaving?"
31994,"I understand not wanting people to panic, but this downplaying of the situation is just getting ridiculous."
31995,Yes but can‚Äôt the virus infect a person through their eyes?
31996,I would like to speak to you about your lord and savior Jesus Christ.
31997,He forgives you.
31998,I'll message you privately some important information pertaining to salvation.
31999,&gt; And frankly it‚Äôs only going to get worse as we move down the tiers to different kinds of essential workers being vaccinated.
32000,It's only gotten better over time so expecting it to get worse doesn't gel with what we have already seen.
32001,The lower tiers also almost always include the cut and dry age requirements.
32002,"So while you're setting up a mobile vaccine clinic for the King Sooper's, you're also going to have CVS able to just ID people and give out doses rapidly that way."
32003,"Many states have already moved on to their second sub-phase, and we haven't seen a slow down."
32004,"Everything from ""Have the national guard..."" I would mostly agree with."
32005,Exactly this.
32006,Not our fault the UK has more genome sequencing capability in a tiny country (Wales) that can compete with the entirety of mainland Europe.
32007,My joke was that any time the government or a large institution wants to get a point across to the general public their first thought is to make a commercial with that flat pastel art style and a ukulele with a woman telling you everything is going to be okay.

32039,&gt;Conclusion: In OHCA patients without a prehospital ROSC who met the Universal TOR Guideline for transport with ongoing resuscitation survival rates were above the 1% futility rate.
32040,Employing only the lack of ROSC as criteria for termination of resuscitation may miss survivors after OHCA.
32041,LA is now only employing the lack of ROSC for criteria of terminating resuscitation.

32058,Are you trying to claim they're banning it because of the health detriments of alcohol?
32059,That seems unlikely given that they're only banning it in one place (pubs) and specifically say it's due to gatherings.
