1,What's the outlook for those who can't get a second shot due to medical advice not to after complications of first dose?
2,"I did most of my Bachelors online and while I'm still working on my Masters, I started it before COVID as an online program."
3,Online has always been a thing for college.
4,"That's the fault of telling people to do anything they used to do before the pandemic, as if there is sterilizing immunity."
5,"Not the fault of the vaccines, which make it so that only a small percentage of the base rate get confirmed symptomatic covid."
6,"In the controlled presence of NPIs to curb outbreaks, that absolute rate was very small, a percentage of the the base percentage."
7,&gt;And then we do that for how long?
8,"For me, the thing that makes the most sense is ""it depends on the level of vaccination in community spread in your location."""
9,Watching on tv still doesn't prevent infection driven by gathering of all the athletes and support staff...
10,"Less than 1% of people who got the Moderna vaccine reported tinnitus, but 1 out of 3 of all people (and rising) will get tinnitus in their lifetime."
11,"It‚Äôs one of those things that might not even be a real side effect, but because it showed up in the data (as you might expect an ultra-common condition to do) it has to be listed."
12,"If it is a real side effect, it still barely affects your chances of developing tinnitus."
13,Yes but just keep gyms and schools and libraries museums and kids camps etc open.
14,I do not get why they get sacrificed
15,[deleted]
16,True.
17,My worry is the people who will get vaccinated are doing so already and we will see the numbers drop/not grow much going forward.
18,When we went for our second shot a few weeks ago the centre wasn‚Äôt very busy.
19,Not as busy as you would expect anyway.
20,And I‚Äôm in Lyon so not exactly a small low population area.

22,&gt; Canada donate its doses as part of Covax.
23,There's no Pfizer nor Moderna in that program.
24,Wrong.
25,"&gt;Canada deal.for doses are for years, they need to keep enough for potential 3rd dose and possibly yearly refresh."
26,Completely irrelevant because new vaccines will have to be bought.
27,These vaccines will all be donated.
28,Just stop spreading misinformation.
29,I would be interested to see that as well.
30,"I have a strong suspicion that *not all,* but some cases of Long Covid are psychosomatic."
31,What if we just didn't travel until we were vaccinated
32,"In my state, Iowa, the legislature has outlawed masks at public schools."
33,Forever.
34,It's madness.
35,Over 80% of our cases are Delta at this point.
36,&gt;This is not a real concern.
37,"The mRNA vaccines target the spike protein, so if the virus mutates so much that the vaccines are no longer effective, it has simultaneously mutated itself out of being able to infect humans at all."
38,That's false.
39,A spike protein is composed out of roughly 1000-1500 amino acids and it varies from virus to virus.
40,"Many, many variants can interact with the human  ACE2 receptor."
41,"All the different human coronaviruses have different spike proteins, that can all infect us and none of our current anti bodies that work against those coronaviruses work against COVID19."
42,That's why it's novel.
43,"We've also already seen mutations that changed the spike protein for COVID19, thankfully so far those mutations have not affected immunity for people with antibodies negatively."
44,It's entirely feasible that a mutation changes the spike proteins enough to (mostly) avoid the anti bodies formed by the mRNA vaccines but still being able to interact with the ACE2 receptor.
45,This is called a shift.
46,This is to be expected at some point given enough mutations.
47,This is relatively rare but it's precisely the reason why we want to keep the active virus mass (i.e.
48,infected humans) as low as possible.
49,The more people get infected the higher the chance for a shift.
50,"It's highly likely to get something called a drift, small enough changes that are still mostly being identified as COVID by our anti bodies."
51,We already see this with the known variants.
52,E.g.
53,the Biontech vaccine seems to be slightly less effective vs the Delta variant.
54,Enough drift and you might require a booster shot to get good protection again.
55,Drift means you don't start at 0 since there is some kind of protection for some portion of the vaccinated populous.
56,E.g.
57,50% less infections and 70% less hospitalizations.
58,Enough to slow down the spread but not enough to stop it.
59,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And, even if some currently unpredictable or unexplainable scenario happens in which the virus evades mRNA vaccines but does remain infectious (which from my understanding would be ridiculously unlikely), 

Again, it's much more likely than you think with hundreds of millions of infections and the scenario is far from unexplainable."
60,"mRNA vaccines, as much of a breakthrough they are, are not magic."
61,All they do is offer a vessel to contain information for the body to produce antigens/proteins on its own.
62,It's a shortcut to producing the antigens directly in the body instead of outside of it in a lab.
63,It's a quicker process and apparently it looks like it can be more precise but in the end all it does it create antigens (in this case the spike protein) in the body.
64,"If those no longer match the virus, the immunity is gone or heavily diminished."
65,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt;the breakthrough in mRNA technology as a result of this pandemic would allow us to effectively alter the vaccines almost instantly."
66,"You are correct, we can develop mRNA booster shots within weeks."
67,"The issue is, if the old vaccine no longer works due to a shift we would have to start from zero again and we lose the progress we made from the first 3.5 billion doses of various vaccines we administered."
68,It's taken us 7 month to get where we are now.
69,"&amp;#x200B;

80,the maps with positivity rates by zip code can give you a sense of where you should mask up.
81,No it‚Äôs not.
82,In Ontario they gave out too many fist Pfizer doses.
83,There wasn‚Äôt an order big enough of Pfizer to give everyone a second dose of the same brand.
84,It‚Äôs a government fuckup
85,"Before anyone flips out, the risk of getting GB from the vaccine is 

1."
86,Less than it is from getting covid.
87,2.
88,Not unlike the flu vaccine (which also is less of a risk of getting GB than with getting GB from the flu).
89,GB is caused by the antibodies you make to an antigen (ie spike protein) looking like something in your nervous system.
90,Myocarditis and type 1 diabetes occur in the same fashion.
91,"Since vaccines have about 1/100th of the antigen as the natural infection, the antibodies tend to be more specific to just the bad stuff and have less autoimmune risk."
92,"From the article:

&gt; California K-12 students who refuse to wear masks inside school classrooms and buildings, as required under new state rules, will be prohibited from entering their campus, and another form of education will be provided to them, according to new regulations the state released Monday."
93,&gt; Exceptions will be made for students with special health needs or disabilities.
94,"&gt; The state rules build on recommendations released Friday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which provide flexibility to states and school districts."
95,"Under the federal recommendations, for example, a school could allow vaccinated students to attend classes without masks."
96,"California is choosing to take a more strict and uniform approach, which also is possible under the federal framework."
97,"&gt; According to the most recently collected data, 99% of responding school districts have reported that they will reopen fully for in-person instruction by the fall of 2021."
98,"&gt; ‚ÄúThat seems to be a safe course for ensuring that every student can come back to school in the fall,‚Äù said state Supt."
99,"of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond, who has reviewed the state health rules."
100,"‚ÄúI certainly see the logic of it.‚Äù

‚Ä¶ more at link."
101,my understanding is that the city does break down the data that way so that public health officials know where to focus efforts.
102,But that‚Äôs not what always what news outlets focus on.
103,"Also, the data seems constantly evolving."
104,"For example, just today an NYC public researcher told public radio that the pop up vaccination sites are turning out to be not as effective in the poorer neighborhoods, so new strategies are in the works."
105,I only have my anecdotal evidence and keep in mind my view of France is still as a ‚Äúforeigner‚Äù as I am not a French native but a British immigrant 3 years ago.
106,"However my wife is French for whatever that‚Äôs worth üòÅ

Anyway my thoughts‚Ä¶ France has a ‚Äúfondness‚Äù for homeopathic remedies which is bigger than I think most people realise/admit."
107,For example I herniated a disc in my lower back at the start of the year moving heavy furniture.
108,Almost everyone I know told me to go to a chiropractor rather than have an MRI and follow medical advice.
109,When I say I had an MRI and followed the spine specialists advice people look at as if I am weird.
110,My sister in law also herniated a disc in her back ten years ago and still has issues and goes to a chiropractor a few times a year still!
111,Whereas my back is basically fine now.
112,She had an MRI after three(!)
113,"years (which is how she knows it is a herniated disc) but never followed up and just keeps going to a chiropractor ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

When covid hit almost everyone we know didn‚Äôt take it that seriously."
114,They ignored the measures of not mixing households etc so we know many people who have had covid.
115,Some of them badly and a few have friends or family that died.
116,Yet they still play with fire ignoring the advice.
117,As for anti vax specifically I feel social media is the biggest factor.
118,My parents in law refuse it as they honestly believe there is a massive cover up of vaccine related deaths.
119,In the range of *millions* of people.
120,They believe all the crap they read on Facebook and ‚Äúnews‚Äù sites.
121,I don‚Äôt know how true that is for other people but it certainly true of a few people we know.
122,Also many people just don‚Äôt trust/like Macron.
123,They think he is lying about how serious covid is and just doing all this to stay in power.
124,So yeah it‚Äôs weird.
125,At least for my small view of France.
126,That would be extremely unlikely.
127,I would definitely prioritize clean hands over shoes on or off.
128,"But, in September, they are going to start making people pay--hoping to push them to get vaccinated instead of using multiple tests to test negative."
129,It will be interesting to see if that works.

131,Excellent point!!
132,The Sky was so blue last spring and summer
133,"&gt; you made a baseless argument with no evidence

That‚Äôs becuase you don‚Äôt understand my argument."
134,If you re-read it more carefully I think it‚Äôs pretty clear but I‚Äôll summarize it again for you below.
135,&gt; What evidence do you have that this is due to lack of access?
136,I have not made a claim as to the cause.
137,The claim I made to you is that *your* take is focused on parts of the article which *they* don‚Äôt back up and ignoring the parts they do.
138,My assumption is that you‚Äôre doing this because you have a bias against people from the areas the article mentioned.
139,"&gt; the correlation between political partisanship and vaccination rates is about 0.85

Correlation is a worthless without some sort of causal connection."
140,You might as well be talking about divination using tea leaves for all the scientific value it has and it‚Äôs totally unrelated to my argument anyway.
141,See above.
142,Get a neucleocapsid antibody test.
143,You're fine.
144,The WHO is not being entirely reasonable here.
145,the superpowers happen once you get the 3rd one from a 3rd company.
146,Canada donate its doses as part of Covax.
147,There's no Pfizer nor Moderna in that program.
148,"Canada deal.for doses are for years, they need to keep enough for potential 3rd dose and possibly yearly refresh."
149,"The day they'll give something else than AZ will see, but it's not planned yet."
150,So given it's hypothetical and may never happen I ignored that part as they hypothetical situation won't change anything on perception of AZ here following this donation.
151,I was so glad to see CA take that stance.
152,I'm hoping MA will follow.
153,France's vaccination rate is below the EU average but not by much.
154,EU average is 53.9% and France is 52.3%.
155,Germany is ahead by 5.7% which is statistically significant but it's nothing dramatic.
156,The question is will this gap widen over time.
157,BC is 100% based on first shot date for second shots.
158,You‚Äôll get your invite to book at 7 weeks for Pfizer/moderna and 8 weeks for AZ.

168,"As usual, the headline misleads somewhat."
169,Some israel scientists are speculating that the immunity from vaccines begins waning around 6 months.
170,So maybe that is why they got it?
171,"&gt;about 75% of the people who die or are hospitalized with Covid after vaccination are over the age of 65, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."
172,"&amp;#x200B;

Anybody happen to know what the breakdown by age is for unvaccinated people?"
173,Is this very different?
174,"From that article:
""CCTV footage revealed two people walking past each other while at a mall transmitting the virus."""
175,"Unless they were emitting colored clouds of virus vapor or something, I think we'd have to dismiss that claim as merely a guess."
176,"And not a particularly good guess, since there's no evidence at all that such a thing is even remotely possible."
177,"(There are plenty of people who *suspect* they got it from a trip to the grocery store or a jogger 30 feet away from them outside, but my suspicion is that they got it from extended contact with a loved one that they assumed didn't or couldn't have it.)"
178,It‚Äôs not the least desirable vaccine.
179,But if there was such a thing it would probably be one of the ineffective Chinese ones.
180,The fact of the matter is that AZ offers similar levels of protection after two doses to Pfizer.
181,So rejecting it just out of pride is almost as bad as being an anti-vaxxer.
182,The opinion is completely detached from reality.
183,"They die faster, so they're cheaper."
184,It is what it is.
185,How do you know you wouldn't have died if you caught covid?

187,"So you say:

&gt;The whole PCR threshold debacle was anti-vax covid denier misinformation."
188,"and then you say:

&gt;I was being glib by saying ct threshold doesn‚Äôt matter... it does... just not on its own."
189,This is how it was explained to me.
190,People like you poison the discussion and prevent meaningful education.
191,"The cycle threshold issue was popularized by a well-researched NYTimes article in August 2020, which you may have foolishly dismissed as ""anti-vax covid denier misinformation."""
192,"[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/29/health/coronavirus-testing.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/29/health/coronavirus-testing.html)

197,"In July, the lab identified 872 positive tests, based on a threshold of 40 cycles."
198,"&gt;  
&gt;With a cutoff of 35, about 43 percent of those tests would no longer qualify as positive."
199,About 63 percent would no longer be judged positive if the cycles were limited to 30.

207,Do what you want.
208,"If you want to wear a mask, wear one."

310,"https://www.dcboe.org/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=51012afc-bc2c-4a78-84ec-c48cc47f7805

That's quite a ways off from ""96%."""
311,Math is hard I guess.
312,&gt; keep our masks on indoors or in crowds.
313,I got a Jury Duty Summons.
314,I really really really really dont want to go sit in a room full of people.
315,Ill have an N95 on for sure.
316,I am vaccinated but im not taking that risk

318,"Enormous distrust of the government, social networks and their bubbles, some half assed lip service to personal liberties while conveniently forgetting about the importance of solidarity in France, and a hell of a petulant attitude about being a free thinker and not going along with the crowd (while being wrapped around anti vaxxers fingers ironically)."
319,"It‚Äôs perhaps a slight partisan issue in the sense that macron is heavily detested by a sizeable minority, but the above issues trump that reason IMO."

322,"Well, guess I‚Äôll see what my school will say soon"
323,[deleted]
324,I feel like you guys would be better off fact checking instead of just deleting someone's comment.
325,So it did happen but children under 12 weren't vaccinated and they might've been carrying it causing people on the cruise to get it.
326,This makes the most sense right.
327,Donate vaccines to less vaccinated countries to reduce the likelihood of future mutations like the delta and lambda.
328,"That ways, booster shots wont be need."
329,Calling the AZ vaccine trash is fucking ridiculous.
330,The UK has very heavily relied on it and it is obviously an exceptionally effective vaccine.
331,&gt;Blame can be redirected.
332,"Exactly, and it can be done in either way."
333,"Though it's would be far more difficult for China to get the evidence of a US sabotage compared with vice versa, as the end products would be in Taiwan not in China."
334,"The strategy also depends largely on who can control the international media, and we all know who's better at that."
335,"See, you are making defending China to be too easy."
336,Data from the same countries show that vaccinated people will be fine even if they get infected.
337,"If people refuse to get vaccinated in the US, then they are willingly rolling the dice with their life."
338,100% correct.
339,0% chance of happening.
340,The fact that you‚Äôre getting downvoted for sharing facts is so infuriating.
341,This sub is full of people who only acknowledge news if it fits their agenda of going back to normal ASAP.
342,It‚Äôs really fucking sad and embarrassing.
343,Damn those are awesome numbers.
344,"Y'all are right at the tip of ""heard immunization""."
345,Keep Canada cool!
346,You're not listening.
347,You kept providing anecdotal examples.
348,"How do I interpret Singapore not counting people vaccinated with sinovac as ""vaccinated"" at the same time allowing sinovac?"
349,That is the question for you to ask your government.
350,We're talking about how effective sinovac is and what do I care about bribery case.
351,Your claim that sinovac does not have enough vaccine info is not correct.
352,The wiki page says https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinovac\_Biotech real world study in Chili showed 65% effective against symptomatic; 87% against hospitalization; 90% against ICU admission and 86% against deaths.
353,"You are going to see other studies from Indonesia, Brazil, Turkey on the wiki page."
354,The Turkey announced 84% effectives (against what?).
355,Why we do not see the other western countries using Sinovac?
356,"Well, because they don't need to."
357,"They have access to Pfizer, AZ, Modorna with better effective rate."
358,"Again, our discussion is comparing vaccinated using sinovac and not vaccinated at all."
359,"If our discussion is about Sinovac vs Pfizer, AZ, or Modorna, I would personally pick the latter."
360,But for many people they don't have a choice.
361,A sinovac is MUCH better than no vaccine.
362,This is my last reply for this topic.
363,Cheers.
364,This number seems rediculously low.
365,Hoping you have a quick recovery.
366,70% pro plague and pro plague accessories
367,&gt; Which means 5% did not get immune or got a weak response and can still have pretty bad disease.
368,That‚Äôs really not how it works.
369,"Oh, gee, it's almost like this virus has been trained to kill people who don't want vaccines, and to evolve into a deadlier form at the exact point in time that the people who do want vaccines have them."
370,You don't think...
371,I believe it !
372,"Too be fair, well at least when I say it, I 100% dont mean kids, if they could get vaccinated, I know most sane parents would get them their shots, the fuck the unvaccinated is towards the jackasses that know better."

385,How long should mask mandates remain in place?

394,"Not worse, just less sensitive."
395,Antigen tests are generally faster and cheaper and don't require the same expensive machinery.
396,"Also, there is te delta variant."
397,There are reports that it bypasses protection from vaccines
398,"People have been saying *everything* that has been done to control the spread of of the disease is ""authoritarian"" since the very beginning."
399,I'm sick of it.
400,It's not a viewpoint that deserves to be taken seriously.
401,It's literally nothing more than the whining of overgrown children.
402,"And even if that wasn't the case, why are you telling me to defend my position and not the moron who complained about authoritarianism without offering any justification?"
403,Double standard much?
404,[removed]
405,"Whoops, that number absolutely sucks."
406,It's basically insufficient to keep Delta steady/calm.
407,A virus with R0 &gt;=8 as the Delta variant will just eat up the unprotected 30‚Äì40% pretty easily
408,"There are many neighborhoods over 70% for first shot, some as high as 100%."
409,NYC is more diverse socioeconomically and politically than some folks might think.
410,There are some pretty conservative neighborhoods in Brooklyn that were having huge anti-mask rallies/protests last year.
411,Same with Staten Island.
412,The poorer and/or more conservative neighborhoods are lagging behind just like everywhere else in the country.
413,"Lots of people are still masking and cautious after last year, but not everyone."
414,How many breakthrough cases are they seeing?
415,We are being told that breakthroughs are exceedingly rare.
416,Lied to us again?
417,Forever?
418,Or until some target is reached?
419,What is the target?
420,That‚Äôs pretty much all the CDC has done since the pandemic started lol.
421,"They‚Äôve lost all credibility, imo"
422,[removed]
423,Be careful with how much you look up while in isolation.
424,It can turn you hypochondriac.
425,Too much reading can get people super anxious‚Ä¶which overlaps with long covid symptoms.
426,Wear an N95?
427,The FDA also allows mixing of vaccines in certain circumstances.
428,"Luckily for the USA they never ran into those circumstances, whereas most if not all other countries have."
429,"COVID is fairly unique in that it's right on the cusp of whether suppression or mitigation are better, leading to arguments even among good actors."
430,"And after vaccination, many places are mostly reopen, others are opening, everyone is super excited to not wear masks anytime they can."
431,"If 25-year-olds were killed at a 10-20% rate like 1918 flu did, that would not be the case."
432,Suppression would be the only rational choice.
433,Note this scenario is in no way connected to reality.
434,"SARS-CoV-2 mutates much slower than influenza, we already have vaccines, and we have the ability to change our vaccines on a moments notice (e.g."
435,to specifically target delta or some future variant) if we wanted to.
436,I'm vaccinated.
437,"If you're not, and you're in public, and you manage to get within my six foot radius, and I somehow manage to give you covid, and you had an immune disorder?"
438,I'm not acting irresponsibly in this scenario.
439,That's for sure.
440,I think all of us who‚Äôve gotten our shots have ‚Äúwised up‚Äù already and did what we needed to do.
441,This kind of attitude is what‚Äôs keeping people that have not gotten the shots from getting them.
442,"Telling them that even after the shots, you‚Äôd better live your life as you‚Äôve done for over a year now, or you are selfish, will definitely not convince them."
443,This demanding and condescending attitude isn‚Äôt helping.
444,"Seems like yes, but less"
445,"&gt;It has worked out well in some cases (delaying the second dose in the UK and other countries), and not so well in

I bet if you look at the UK's reasoning for extending the 2nd dose, like Canada, they have a mountain of evidence to back up why they made their decision and why they felt comfortable doing so without running a new trial."
446,Just like we would never run a trial to make sure a 2nd shots works at 25 days instead of 21 days.
447,"&gt;other cases (hydroxychloroquine, various home remedies for COVID, etc)."
448,The opposite of my above statement.
449,"Some of those recommendations have evidence to back up their claims, others do not."
450,I know which ones I'd trust.
451,"Mixing similar vaccines isn't new, we've done it in the past and we'll be doing it again in the future."
452,Why is this point downvoted?
453,"Honestly, the person refuting didn‚Äôt even address the question about cycle threshold."
454,It‚Äôs a legitimate question that warrants an answer.
455,Guaranteed my masked 6-year-old has more friends than this guy does.

459,"MB and SK are well past the peak, AB is right behind."
460,Literally zero mention of the US.

463,"The hospitalizations always lag a bit behind the cases, wait a few days"

472,&gt;I dunno about that.
473,100% of the people who believe in doctors end up dead.
474,So you don't believe in doctors?
475,Or you referring to the fact that life has 100% mortality rate
476,And what year was that?
477,In all honesty both of our POV are anecdotal.
478,I've in service now and if anything only the Chinese Navy or government get hate from us--certainly no middleasterns besides the Ayatolla himself
479,It's easy to downplay when you say it's just 2% of the population.
480,"That's a small number, big deal."
481,"Sure, that 2% actually represents 6 million Americans but 2% is so much easier to ignore."
482,"By the way, never forget 9/11 where 3,000 people died."
483,No thanks‚Ä¶

488,Unmasked people are likely more aggressive
489,"Ssshh they are trying to make China vaccine looks bad, don't bring logic into this"
490,Isn‚Äôt that the same as natural immunity?
491,Good catch critical thinker (not /s)
492,"Sure, missing events or having things closed I can see you wouldn't want to go through again, but why would you have a problem with wearing a mask or distancing?"
493,Those pretty much cost you nothing and possibly have a lot of benefit on the large scale if there's a lot od outbreaks going around.
494,"I‚Äôm in Canada, not as much hesitancy here, we are at 67.6% of our entire population with at least one dose and in my province (BC) we are at 78.8% of people over 12 with one shot."
495,"But totally agree, gotta keep the conversation going!"
496,"Someone below posted this one: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8088823/

499,Ooo that‚Äôs nice.
500,Probably better in fact.

502,NACI which is a non-Government group comprised of scientist that makes recommendations that we generally follow decided it was better to mix Pfizer and Moderna to more quickly give everyone their 2nd shot than it was to wait for additional Pfizer vaccines to show up.
503,We had already extended 2nd shots to up to 16 weeks I believe to get as many people their first dose as possible.
504,As the Delta variant started becoming more prominent world wide and it didn't look like a single dose was super great against fighting it (I believe some reports suggested 33% efficacy) it was thought a better direction would be to get as many people 2nd doses as possible.
505,We know both Pfizer and Moderna are extremely similar and are essentially eliciting the same response for the same spike protein it was deemed it would be safe to mix and match mRNA vaccines.
506,Mixing vaccines isn't un-common and is done frequently world wide.
507,Here you can find why they recommended it including sources to their reasoning.

514,There's no Covid in Queensland pretty simple.
515,Which factual statistic do you have issue with or is it just the ones that don't suit your position.
516,Technically it can learn.
517,A virus must adapt to survive.
518,"Adapting is a result of learning correct so whether it was consciously or not it managed to learned how to survive; hence, it virus can learn."
519,People need to stop perceiving as other living things as incapable of evolving.
520,Any living thing has the capability of evolving to the point of sentience.
521,We are the living proof.
522,We have seen animals and organisms do unorthodox things to survive that even us humans never would have thought or are capable of doing.
523,&gt;On the other side there seems to be an unhealthy strain here of only focusing on the negatives and underselling/completely ignoring how we're in a much better situation than this time last year or Christmas.
524,People also seem to want to divert attention away from the fact that vaccines are working very well!
525,"Vaccines work very well, but it's too early to go wild with re-opening especially when full vaccination rate is not that high."
526,The recurring trend we see in this pandemic is that people want to think it is all over and done with whenever some measure of success is achieved.
527,"Then shortly afterwards, they are unfailingly proven wrong with a massive outbreak and people dying."
528,The deadly second and third waves were caused by this mindset during the tail end of the previous waves.
529,I can be sympathetic to those whose livelihoods are affected by the pandemic but a substantial amount of people who want out are those who simply want to have fun.
530,There is a lesson not being learned here.
531,Not sure what the next step is though.
532,"If we do this now, when do we take them off?"
533,What do you mean we would stop letting it spread?
534,Aren‚Äôt we trying that?
535,I think you are correct.
536,"The trials and studies had very good efficacy, but not 99.7%."

549,"For now maybe, but people who can't be vaccinated aren't going to stop existing once the majority of eligible people--children included!--are vaccinated."
550,"At some point, mask-wearing will just have to be completely optional."
551,Yep.
552,Was literally the accepted argument in the Supreme Court case that stated that vaccinations could be mandatory.

573,The vaccines work.
574,Even vaccinated people that catch covid have very mild cases like a small flu
575,Are you vaxxed?
576,"If so, then you should be good (only talking covid here)."
577,Thank you for this moderate and reasoned take.
578,&gt; My second Pfizer dose knocked me on my ass for two days.
579,I can certainly understand someone who had that happen with first dose and maybe had to miss a couple days work being reluctant to do it again.
580,Potentially having to miss days of work two times in four weeks is in part what motivated me to get the J&amp;J and be done with it after the one shot.
581,People in this sub only want to believe good news and bury their heads in the sand if they hear something concerning or negative.
582,It‚Äôs fucking sad.
583,"Sorry if this is a stupid question, but isn't the main purpose of a vaccine to teach your immune system how to create antibodies to the virus quickly and effectively?"

592,Totally agree with that.
593,But hospitalization and death aren't the only things we should be concerned with when we know about long term damages caused by asymptomatic and mild cases that did not require hospitalization.
594,In the case of the Canadian border it‚Äôs the Canadian government that wants it to remain restricted.
595,The US is just cooperating with Justin Trudeau here.

597,Fully vaccinated but still got it.
598,"What a moron, told him not to go out often but old people just don't fucking listen!"
599,I am so pissed off at how complacent he became after getting his second dose.
600,So how does having a condescending attitude like this help us solve the problem?
601,"You think that you are going to shame or pressure the unvaccinated to get the shots by saying ‚Äúget your shots, and after that you‚Äôd better wear your mask until further notice!‚Äù No, you won‚Äôt."
602,Good info that is not in the posted article.

605,And yes I think everyone is well aware of the last paragraph
606,While the Delta variant may be more infectious.
607,It should be noted that children aged 0-11 are at *extremely* low risk for hospitalization and death.
608,"The hospitalization rate for children aged 0-4 stands at a cumulative of 0.06%, which peaked at 0.002% in December 2020, and is currently down at 0.0002% as of June 26, 2021 ([CDC Source](https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/COVIDNet/COVID19_3.html))."

618,So we‚Äôre basically screwed?
619,"Not to mention that the majority of kids‚Äô language development and speech production is learned at home where your caregivers are, of course, not wearing masks."
620,And kids that grow up in cultures where women cover their faces in public for religious reasons still develop speech and social skills as expected.
621,And kids that are blind who have no visual input whatsoever are able to socialize and speak just fine as well.
622,"I think you could make the argument that learning some phonemic spelling patterns might be difficult because of a mask (‚Äòth‚Äô in particular comes to mind) and learning a second language is made more difficult; but actually being able to back this with data when all disruptions of schooling in the last 18 months had a greater effect, would be pretty difficult to do."
623,"the whole thing is, vaccines have normally taken a decade+ to develop."
624,researching a certain virus alone takes time and is incredibly taxing.
625,"science is all about time and seeing how things work, the fact we are where we are now is pretty incredible."

627,This is straight out of a nightmare.
628,"Well it would end a whole lot quicker if we didn't have to explain the same concept of transmission, vaccination and other aspects of public health to people who've ordained themselves high priests of virology because their hairdresser on Instagram shared some insanity and you took it as gospel."
629,Says who
630,[removed]
631,[removed]
632,*sydney.
633,"Has only just reached Goulburn, the whole state isn‚Äôt effected."
634,So far
635,That's one way to make our stats on vaccinated infections vs unvaccinated infections look really great.
636,Seems like a DeSantis move
637,[removed]
638,We already pledge to donate 80M doses.
639,"What rich countries should do, is to ignore WHO."
640,May be countries who are free-riding on our R&amp;D and vaccines should be a little less entitled and a little more grateful.
641,"Governments, particularly democratic ones, should and will prioritize their own people over foreign countries, particularly in a life &amp; death situation like a pandemic."
642,"If CDC and scientists say we need boosters, we use boosters."
643,"I am all for helping and donate vaccines, but not before we have enough .. boosters, vaccines and whatever that scientists deem necessary, and not sending a dose out before that."
644,This is particularly important when delta seems to have a renew surge here.
645,"If the tables were turned, poor countries will do the same."
646,It's certainly not a quick fix but there are millions of people who are waiting for the vaccines to get full approval to get their shots.
647,And we're only one week out from the Fourth.
648,I bet you watched a lot of YouTube videos to be this dense.
649,"Could also be that the vaccine didn't provide any protection, especially if you were vaccinated late last year."
650,The reality is we just don't know how long protection lasts or how well the vaccines protect against delta.
651,"That sucks, this whole situation is bs.."
652,Ouch
653,UK discovered.
654,Whether it originated there is another thing.
655,Plenty of places don‚Äôt sequence with they‚Äôd never know where things popped up first
656,"Meanwhile, here in Tennessee, school boards are opting to go back to school next month with optional masking, meaning the vast majority of kids won't be wearing masks at school."
657,Most of the rural districts did not even require masks last year.
658,"They are so fucking stupid here, I really don't think massive hospitalization/death from the Delta variant will be enough to spur school boards into action or parents to get their kids vaccinated."
659,A third of the cases are associated with campylobacter exposure.
660,My case was most likely from a DTaP vaccine.
661,It's important to protect the kids as well.
662,Delta is more infectious for kids.
663,"Even if it's a mild or asymptomatic case, we are seeing long covid cases, neurological issues and changes to grey matter in the brain post covid."
664,These kids are going to be dealing with long term impacts from covid long after we are gone.
665,"https://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthart/2021/07/02/kids-among-most-vulnerable-to-infectious-delta-variant---heres-why-you-should-be-more-worried/?sh=38a9af982701

666,"Vaccine is more like, your immune system is an army and the vaccine trains them to fight the virus when it enters your body."
667,It also trains them to build their own guns and ammo that is effective against the virus.
668,"So it's better for your immune system to have the training and time to build the guns and ammo it needs, but you can still lose the war and battles still can damage the body."
669,"Hopefully less since you should be able to beat the enemy back faster than with less training, guns, and ammo."
670,The minor symptoms after getting the vaccine is like spending the budget on training exercises.
671,The trainees will be tired and there's sometimes a bit of mess to clean up.
672,I'm pretty stunned I've heard zero army metaphors from American health communicators.
673,I thought it would be the natural metaphor.
674,"my dad got polio in the mid 60's, well after the vaccine was out."
675,because of people not taking it he has a long term disability.
676,"its not just something you ""get exposed to"" and you are good and immune"
677,"Less effective now, lasting symptoms unknown for breakthrough infections."
678,Also CDC isn‚Äôt tracking any breakthrough infection unless hospitalized - so no real way to know how much you‚Äôre protected.
679,NY could try to give SI back to NJ and they would just refuse to take it.
680,Sensible.
681,With so much uncertainty it is much safer at the individual level to stick with the precautionary principle.
682,Better to be wrong and too careful than not careful enough and misled by overconfidence.
683,All I know is we don't lockdown or wear masks or block international travel during flu season and that kills about 50k per year.
684,"So yeah comparing on that scale, 1k deaths (or even doubled to 2k) is pretty much a nothing burger."
685,At least as far as people changing how they live because of covid.
686,Word
687,"Most people don't realize that of the 5 NYC boroughs, Staten Island is solidly red."
688,It's Republican territory in a mostly Democratic city.
689,"But not for the others, which is my intended point here."
690,"Pfizer, moderna... ppl are having to wait 4 months to get their second dose and aren't guaranteed the same vaccine."
691,"Yet, somehow canada also has so much extra AZ they can give away 18M doses.."
692,"Just out of curiosity...do you have ""high-risk factors,"" such as age or other medical conditions (e.g., diabetes)?"
693,"Also freezing cold winters, not much to do outside Burlington, and not so great economic opportunity."
694,"Thankfully, the authorities in CA have a more enlightened view."
695,"The ""25th person statistic"" is mentioned in the article we all read."
696,"Here is a snippet:

&gt; Fiscus is at least the 25th official to leave a state‚Äôs top vaccination position since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, according to a USA TODAY investigation published earlier this month."
697,"Most of these officials quit or retired earlier than planned, sometimes because of frustration with the politicization of the virus, USA TODAY reported."
698,"While these officials are not well known to the general public, they are a backbone of the nation‚Äôs vaccination system, both within a pandemic and without."
699,"The statistic is also mentioned in a letter by Fiscus; you can read that letter here:

700,Old normal is gone for a while‚Ä¶.
701,Especially with delta and lambda reducing the efficacy vaccines and treatments - even though I‚Äôm vaccinated I‚Äôm not interested in signing up for a long Covid lottery.
702,All I have to do is wear a n95 mask??
703,Small price to pay.
704,[removed]
705,I mean with that logic why wear a seatbelt?
706,You drive just fine right?
707,Depends on your country and whether they give a shit?
708,In Australia we genetically track where each infection comes from.
709,"Everyone‚Äôs wearing the mask, there‚Äôs industrial HEPA filtering, and you‚Äôre vaccinated."
710,"You have nothing to worry about, especially thanks to the vaccine."
711,"People who are reasonable will just go back to being more careful during surges and hope that natural immunity helps enough, and that their grandparents don't die."
712,That‚Äôs because of the particular way a rabies infection works though.
713,"The virus moves very slowly up a peripheral nerve before actually infecting the central nervous system, so if you get the vaccine into your system quickly enough, it neutralizes it before it gets to that point."
714,(Rabies antiglobulin is also a thing and is given as part of the treatment) This is not how a covid infection or most other viruses work.
715,You are prettier with your mask on!
716,"To the store, no."
717,But six hours in a class when you‚Äôre trying to learn to spell and speak and navigate social norms?
718,It sucks.
719,"I could understand when we were all doing it, but it‚Äôs not fair to ask the kid in California to stay masked up to protect anti-vaxxers."
720,They would never sacrifice a thing for my family.
721,You've got it backwards: the spike was targeted because it's so essential and hardest for the virus to change and still do what it does.
722,There is every reason to think the vaccine immunuty is better than that of having recovered from a previous infection.
723,But that doesn't mean it is eternal immunity.
724,"And yes, varients are showing spine mutations, but not to a degree that the spike model in the vaccine is meaningless."
725,It's still a lot more capable against mutation than other vaccines we have.
726,[deleted]
727,Thats how all the vaccines work.
728,"Im so sorry to hear that happened to you, I hope your tinnitus is better, that sounds terrible, no one should have to go through that üôèüèªüíû‚ô•Ô∏è"

730,"6 months ago he had it, still no taste, smell, cant read an email and comprehend it."
731,"The vaccine was safe yea, but not the covid."
732,"I wanted to be done in one shot, and was concerned with inflammation since I have a minor heart condition (mitral valve prolapse)."
733,"So far feel fine 1 week out, 30 M. Not sure how valid my concerns were."
734,"Probably the Delta, Delta+, and Lamda variants."
735,Or nobody is testing the 70% of vaccinated people for breakthrough infections and tracking it (looking at you CDC)
736,Seriously.
737,"I can literally also chime in and say I'm currently hospitalized with the Delta Variant and it ""fucked me up"" while being fully vaccinated."
738,I'll believe stories I read in Scientific Journals over random Redditors potentially trying to spread fear (and also some can be anti-vax trolls I assume trying to make others think they are pointless).
739,"6,000 *hospitalized* breakthrough cases bc they don‚Äôt count any positive tests for vaccinated people that are asymptomatic through moderate."
740,I didn't know they made nothing burgers out of dead people.
741,"I wouldn't be surprised if deaths reached 1000, but i'd be shocked if there weren't significant problems with hospitalizations in large parts of the US."

752,Why has the world stopped talking about DELTA PLUS???
753,It is now 90% of genome sequencing in India.
754,Why have we not heard anything about vaccine efficacy towards it?
755,All we hear about is Delta
756,The problem is that we‚Äôre in act 2 of a three act play with corona‚Ä¶ this fall is going to be tough no matter vaccination status.
757,But regular masks protect others from you more than you from others.
758,"Given that vaccinated people are already significantly protected from infection, wearing a mask in public seems like a bit of overkill."
759,"I guess what makes most sense to me is for vaccinated parents to wear masks at home whenever they feel slightly under the weather, just in case it's a mild case of Covid."
760,At at certain high risk events where they may have prolonged contact with unvaccinated people.
761,It is more than fine.
762,And 8-12 weeks is ideal for AZ
763,"I am not sure what punishment you are referring too, but I am certain that kids won't be kicked out of school because they have to be reminded to pull their mask on."
764,"Even the union guidelines have told us to be understanding and lenient, as in, don't complain for mask lapses."
765,This is for parents who want to complain about the mask and insist their kids don't have to wear them.
766,It‚Äôs never going to end.
767,Is nobody getting vaccinated in the US anymore?
768,Rate seems to have slowed down to a crawl
769,"Exactly, so there‚Äôs no good surveillance in the US on vaccine efficacy for mild/moderate cases or if the long term effects are blunted as well."
770,Even mild or asymptomatic cases without vaccination can have lasting physiological changes.
771,High hopes Colorado follows suit.
772,FIL contracted corona a couple weeks ago.
773,He had 2 shots of AZ early this year.
774,He was quarantined at home with my MIL and SIL the entire time... with both of them caring for him.
775,MIL is vaccinated and SIL is not.
776,"He seems to have recovered now (he had some kind of nasty symptoms), and neither my MIL nor SIL were infected (test confirmed)."
777,I havent been following it all a ton but isnt california the only one saying masks are mandatory?
778,"I really wanted to wait til august to go home so as to minimize the time spent living with my toxic family before moving out, but with the delta variant causing surges in FL I‚Äôm debating hightailing out of here on my days off Thursday and Friday."

782,This comment reeks of entitlement.
783,Wearing a mask is not a major sacrifice.
784,"&gt;Wearing a mask around them runs counter to CDC guidance going back a few months now

The CDC was more like, ""It'll probably be okay."""
785,"Given their serial fuckups, I'll be taking a bit more cautious approach."
786,Wouldn‚Äôt surprise me cases shoot back up in the fall
787,[removed]
788,Are these new?
789,Because pre covid I‚Äôd get sick every single time I flew long haul.
790,"Southern Hemisphere Winter to NH summer, SH summer to NH winter, europe, USA, I‚Äôm talking 40+  long haul (18-24 hour) trips."
791,Every single time I‚Äôd be sick within a couple of days.
792,I do not buy that you don‚Äôt get sick from planes
793,What's wrong is you are forgetting that masks are much more effective at stopping outbound spread than they are at inbound.
794,"An infected person, and a vaccinated parent share the same indoor space."
795,The parent is MUCH less likely to get a breakthrough case and bring it home if the infected person is the one wearing the mask.
796,"Wearing the mask themselves has some benefit, but much less."
797,"Best would be if everyone still wore one, so you have two barriers."
798,"Or maybe one effective barrier, given how incompetent most people are at mask fitting."
799,"The ""too much bother, it's over because we are tired if it"" crowd will now demonstrate their ignorance with downvotes:"
800,It literally wouldn't have even had to take this long had they stuck with it last year and now there's a vaccine and it's still impossible ffs..
801,"Sigh, at this point, I don't know what we can do."
802,"Countries in Europe are requiring a test or vaccine to go to a restaurant or event...and in the US, everything is pretty much back to normal."
803,The incentive for a lot of people is not there.
804,I still don't understand why this is a problem for some people.

858,If they hadn't tried to fight reality and the spread of truth - basically cut people's freedom of speech - it likely wouldn't have spread the way it has.
859,"And here you are praising the benefits of their system because you think it's more apt to deal with what's going on, even saying they're *succeeding* based on all of that."
860,"How did we get to a place where this is such a pressing worry (because I agree, it very much is)?"
861,"Like if I put on sunscreen but still got a bit burned while most people who used the same sunscreen avoided looking like lobsters, I‚Äôm going to blame my own skim-milk complexion and not rage against the providers of SPF?!"
862,How did society lose the plot to this extent?
863,Yeah I remember clearly when WHO was saying that EU vaccination was going ‚Äútoo slow‚Äù despite the fact that 50% of doses produced in EU was exported abroad.
864,Likewise in Iowa.
865,[deleted]
866,Based on the 6 months of recovery and the vaccine not really being available before this year I doubt it.
867,"Yeah, I really wish they would stop referring to that level as ‚Äúmild‚Äú."
868,"they were trying to reassure the public and stop people from panicking, but instead they gave people the idea that if you get it it will probably be no big deal."
869,"In fairness, it probably won‚Äôt take people 3 to 6 months to recover if they were already vaccinated."

872,"I hadn't detailed my taught enough, I was only refering to people believe and perception in the region where I am (West Africa)."
873,It has nothing to do with the actual efficiency.
874,Countries were ready to authorize any vaccine with &gt;50% efficiency and AZ is way above this.
875,"I just feel that in countries where there was already strong vaccine reticence, hearing that Canada will stop using AZ it may reinforce those beliefs."
876,"Lets hope I'm wrong, because dozen of millions of people around where I am could end up preferring no vaccine because of perception, and not science or facts."
877,"Yes, they are doing both in Germany."
878,"I'm in Berlin and I got Pfizer on Friday (following Astra in May), a friend of mine in health care got Astra in February + Moderna in April."
879,"The recommendation is just to follow Astra with an mRNA shot, but not any particular brand."
880,I think it needs to be clear to some people that getting a vaccination doesn't mean you can't ever catch the virus.
881,"It does mean that you are much much less likely to, and your body already has developed antibodies ready to fight it better, leaving you in a lot less lethal position than you would be otherwise."

891,"You just know that if you talk long enough to these dingbats, the hard-core crazy is bound to spill out"
892,Just the fact that you're not coughing or sneezing should mean you're not spreading the virus around as much as someone who is.
893,I‚Äôve treated a bunch of people for covid who were vaccinated so it‚Äôs certainly plausible.
894,"Most people had other health issues like autoimmune disorders, bone marrow issues/transplants, organ transplants requiring immunosuppression, or were very elderly (worse response to vaccines)."

902,"I get what you‚Äôre angling at, but I don‚Äôt think we have compelling data on the transmission rates in vaccinated people, or the things that do/don‚Äôt affect that rate."
903,"We know that the vaccinated are substantially less likely to transmit the virus, it they are indeed one of the breakthrough infected cases."
904,"It‚Äôs unclear the extent to which that holds for delta (fair to assume it‚Äôll still be much less than the unvaccinated but we don‚Äôt know the magnitude of the reduction just yet), nor if there is greater likelihood of transmission in vaccinated breakthrough cases with mild cases vs the asymptomatic ones."
905,"Not trying to nitpick, just that some stuff is still a little bit hazy for the vaccinated population and we‚Äôll need some data readouts to get a better picture on this angle."
906,"Maybe you could highlight the fact that AZ + mRNA is more effective than two doses of the latter, making AZ a necessary part of the best known vaccination option available."

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically."
925,Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) if you have any questions or concerns.
926,*
927,TLDR: Indoor masking allows for minimum disruption to daily life.
928,Isn't this just rapid antigen testing vs PCR testing?
929,"An antigen test is sufficient for traveling in Europe, but you typically do a PCR when you are back in your home country."
930,"Suffer not the little children, right ?"
931,Do you have a source to support your claim about long COVID?
932,"If it was psychosomatic, you wouldn't expect this result:

'The Imperial College study in June produced estimates of numbers people with long Covid which were nearly double those from the ONS in May."
933,"One difference is that the Imperial study asked people if they had persistent symptoms, rather than asking if people had long Covid.'"
934,&gt;it would have been prevented by vaccination.
935,"And yes, that's the point of vaccinations, but 1 shot of AZ doesn't confer enough protection to count as herd immunity against the Delta variant."
936,I wonder how many fans/stadium workers are getting hit COVID right now during the NBA playoffs.
937,Such a dramatic difference from last seasons bubble where the literally quarantined all the players and staff within Disney World.
938,"Now we've got 25,000 unmasked people packed into the deer district in Milwaukee for each game in the finals, plus another 20,000 inside the arena."
939,When is it expected that 2 years old+ can get vaccinated?
940,I got it a few weeks ago and have unfortunately passed away.
941,[removed]
942,How does it endanger other people?
943,"I agree that they put in danger each other, non vaccinated, but it is their choice to take the extra risk, I don't agree but I respect their decission."
944,"but if you are vaccinated you risk of dying from covid is minimal, probably driving a car or a motorbike is more dangerous than covid for fully vaccinated people."
945,"To your first statement: forgetting the fact that this vaccine is experimental right now and not fully approved, please, have some empathy, some people are really scared of it, and you are forcing it on them, causing serious depressions, many people are feeling left out in society right now, it is morally wrong and for very little, if any, benfit"
946,Good job providing no sources.
947,Jail is a deadly lie!
948,[deleted]
949,I hope you recover soon.
950,"This scares me though, im fully vax‚Äôd but ig anyone who is can still get hospitalized?"
951,"I was in Mallorca last August, and multiple beaches had a handful of people on them"
952,Well they‚Äôre not getting vaxxed.
953,Now what.
954,Plea harder?
955,"There are some countries where they‚Äòre a huge success, with Austria being one example."
956,You can only go to restaurants/hairdressers and others if you‚Äòre either 1)vaccinated (21 days after 1st dose) 2)tested in the last 24/48 hours 3)had COVID and recovered.
957,It‚Äòs one of the reasons Austria has one of the lowest incidences in the Western world even though everything is open (even though it‚Äôs rising in the last week)
958,"I do think there‚Äôs a lot of evidence that cloth/paper masks, in close quarters like planes, aren‚Äôt really effective."
959,"If you‚Äôre breathing covid air for an hour without being vaxed, a layer of cloth won‚Äôt do you much good."
960,"I mean I‚Äôm an RN and I always joke that I‚Äôm basically a combination waiter and drug dealer lol

Obviously I do more than that but a lot of this work is just menial bullshit 

Especially if you‚Äôre not in the ICU"
961,[deleted]
962,There are these people under age 12 who can‚Äôt get it.
963,"They are called ‚Äúkids‚Äù and they count, too."
964,"My family of three all got it in the last two weeks: my wife and I (both fully vaxxed) and my daughter, who is ten so can‚Äôt get vaxxed yet."
965,My daughter and I cleared quarantine yesterday and my wife will on Thursday.
966,"All of us had similar cases: symptomatic, fevery for a day or two, achy with a cough and then fine by day 7 or 8."
967,"That being said, it pretty much screwed 2 weeks of our July and we had to cancel two visits with family we were supposed to see for the first time in 18 mos, not to mention numerous other things."
968,It sucks.
969,Masks are not the least effective.
970,The least is doing nothing at all.
971,Masks do something and that‚Äôs better than nothing.
972,And I agree about basing decisions on evidence and data.
973,"Data shows masks work, though."
974,Even in schools.
975,You don‚Äôt have to look at other countries because you can see transmission of other airborne viruses have dropped due to mask wearing and increased hand washing.
976,"We can look at other countries too but you have to account for extraneous variables - like how much of their population is already vaccinated, did they follow initial social distancing protocol, did they have a lock down, was it followed and how strict - if we can find a country that responded in a similar way .. then sure!"
977,Let‚Äôs compare and try to replicate their strategy.
978,I'm about to in a couple weeks.
979,"Got Moderna first, fucked me up, so I am getting Phizer for the second."
980,The U.K. tests A LOT more than Poland and I wouldn‚Äôt trust case numbers coming out of Poland personally.
981,"Also, the U.K. has been about 4-6 weeks ahead of europe with these new waves so I reckon Poland and the rest of the EU will be where the U.K. is now in another month."
982,"_‚ÄúIf it bleeds, it leads‚Äù_"
983,"Eh, not how it was sold here."
984,"Granted, we're unusual in that regard."
985,"Well most unvaccinated people are also young, so that will definitely have a factor in hospitalisations."
986,You really don't understand things don't you.
987,[removed]
988,"I‚Äôm surprised by a lack of regard for people with medical exemptions, those that did not have a chance to get their second dose yet (e.g."
989,"for AZ there is a 3 month interval between shots I believe), and those vaccinated abroad but without EU certificate."
990,With paid PCR tests after September all those categories will be severely limited in their freedoms.
991,"Thought this can only happen in countries like Russia, not France."
992,How old are you and do you have pre existing conditions?
993,"Extremely rare for this to happen, I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through this"
994,They are keeping their people poor (with medical bills) to retain a populous easily-manipulable proletariat.
995,Are they also doing AZ/Moderna or just AZ/Pfizer?
996,"I was surprised to find out that my province in Canada is doing both, despite the completed studies only having tested AZ/Pfizer (as far as I know)."
997,I don't feel super-worried about this situation but was surprised that it is being done even when supplies of both Pfizer and Moderna are both available in a particular vaccination clinic.
998,This is why my wife and I packed up and left almost a year ago to this day.
999,Loved Arkansas.... Until covid hit.
1000,We got the fuck out and went to Chicagoland where my wife's from.
1001,Managed to get our vaccines back in February and very glad we're not still in the south.
1002,[removed]
1003,Ever wonder why children are required to get all those vaccines‚Ä¶?
1004,To protect them and others from getting terrible diseases.
1005,No one wants permanent masks.
1006,"I wish the majority of the population would just get vaccinated already (everyone who can get it, should)."
1007,Then we can be mask free again.
1008,Until then‚Ä¶ we need to slow the spread and wear masks.
1009,Why is this so difficult?
1010,The UK is tiny compared to Canada with a population that‚Äôs way bigger and more densely populated.
1011,The UK is going to be the true test in regards to ending restrictions not Canada.
1012,"Might be a dumb question, based on the article linked above, but was your wife vaccinated when she contracted Covid?"
1013,Because America didn‚Äôt do what Europe did.
1014,We are a shit show here.
1015,Data from Europe doesn‚Äôt translate in this situation.
1016,What grade are you going into?
1017,Nothing gets the heart rate going like a bit of the old chop
1018,"This is valid in quite a few countries in Europe: ES, NL, DE, AU, BE all have very high uptake in the older population"
1019,Not dying from the virus is a pretty good reason in itself for getting the vaccine.
1020,Where would you rather be poor?
1021,That's perhaps the more important question.
1022,"It's hard to find reliable information, but being a communist nation means social welfare for those who cannot find work is essentially guaranteed so long as you're not an illegal alien or belong to an unprotected minority group."
1023,The pathway from rags to riches is also much easier to climb.
1024,I'm not saying it's a great country - far from it.
1025,I'm just pointing out certain aspects from which we might learn and make our own home better.
1026,I‚Äôm 28 and haven‚Äôt had my vaccine.
1027,I will at some point but I‚Äôm in no rush.
1028,Side effects may be rare but so are the chances of me dying from covid.
1029,Both events are extremely rare and I‚Äôm not comfortable with putting myself into a situation that‚Äôs not needed.
1030,I‚Äôll get it in about 12/18 months once things have settled.
1031,The issue is children spread the virus.
1032,"They may not all get severely ill from it if they catch it, but they really can spread it."
1033,Putting hundreds of them in the same area every weekday for hours is not a good idea for the rest of the population.
1034,I would totally love to let kids be mask less if the adult population would get fully vaccinated‚Ä¶ but so many are still nervous about it or believe the lies that are out there.
1035,Remember - masks are not to protect the person wearing it.
1036,It‚Äôs to slow the spread.
1037,"it's important for you to realize that this virus will not burn out on earth, so even if it takes 10 years, you will get it, and you will be totally unprotected"
1038,Many vaccines are already mandatory in France.
1039,That's just one more.
1040,"The ""freedom"" of your body stops where it endangers others peoples who cannot be vaccinated."
1041,My parents are high 80s and they got J&amp;J no problem.
1042,Most likely state funded districts.
1043,Privately funded schools would be exempt.
1044,Are you concerned about getting covid yourself?
1045,Or more along the lines of spreading it?
1046,"I was personally insanely cautious throughout the pandemic (like alienated friends and family cautious), but now that I'm fully vaccinated I'm basically completely returning to normal."
1047,"I just feel at this point like dying or developing terrible long term effects from covid seems really statistically improbable, and that if it happens, it happens."
1048,"I'm concerned about spreading it to others, but I figure they're taking the exact same risks I am."
1049,"Like if they're eating popcorn in the theatre behind me, that's their choice as much as it is mine to be there."
1050,Cautiously watching the news about Delta but I've really had enough.
1051,"I also feel like if things get bad enough that everything goes into lockdown again in a few months, I'll probably have been glad to do all this normal life stuff now."
1052,Just find it interesting how a few months ago you and I would probably be in the same camp re wearing N95s everywhere and being super duper careful.
1053,"It's not main, do you mean most?"
1054,It's both AZ and sinovac.
1055,AZ slightly more.
1056,"Depends on the strain, immunity from original Covid doesn‚Äôt provide adequate protection from Delta variant."
1057,"There are people who got it twice, different strains."
1058,Official sources in my country say that 0.1% of the vaccinated population gets COVID.
1059,"At around 3000000 fully vaccinated people, some 3000 got COVID so far."
1060,These are official numbers (obviously skewed because we did not get to find the asymptomatic numbers).
1061,"So, to answer your question, his story is plausible."
1062,It is also estimated that 1% of those 0.1 die from the infection.
1063,"Shit happens, no vaccine is foolproof, we can just do our best."
1064,Europe isn't as vaccinated as the US

1073,How about screaming and singing?
1074,"I said: ""to what extent""."
1075,"As I say, the vast majority of cases at the moment are among the under 35 age group."
1076,They're out socialising regularly.
1077,Give the virus time to get to those older people and other people not out socialising much and you'll have a better idea as to just how effective the vaccines are at preventing serious illness.
1078,I don't think there's been enough time yet from significant increase in positive cases to confidently assert just how effective the vaccines are.
1079,Many scientists in this country do not share your optimism.
1080,Personally I don't automatically agree with the experts but nor do I rule out their conclusions at this stage.
1081,I think we'll have a better idea around the beginning of August: at that point we'll have seen more older people infected from which to draw conclusions.
1082,I get fully vaccinated on Friday!
1083,Smells like a bad democracy for me.
1084,Fuck 'em.
1085,They have all the tools now to stay alive.
1086,"Not disagreeing with you, its definitely a shady move, but psychologists are technically scientists."
1087,So they weren‚Äôt technically lying.
1088,You have that backwards.
1089,Look at antibiotic resistance for example.
1090,"That more and more diseases are resistant does not come from bacteria getting into contact with people who don't get antibiotics, it comes from bacteria getting into contact with antibiotics and only the more resistance mutations surviving longer that thus have a better chance of spreading."
1091,"If we want to reduce the likelihood of vaccine resistance virus strains, we must make sure that any contact of a vaccinated person with the virus ends as quickly as possible, this means as high a vaccine effectiveness as possible."
1092,"Covid will not vanish, booster shots will be needed."
1093,Rekt
1094,Assume the risk?
1095,What about when it's mandatory?
1096,"Well, you can get them for like 20 dollars."
1097,"Now consider in the US all the medical bills, that health insurance is connected to employment, how that brain fog and fatigue is going to affect your ability to perform at work, how crap US safety nets are."
1098,This is what I fear most from COVID.
1099,"The ‚Äúactual data‚Äù is an amalgam of the tail of NPIs, local depletion of susceptible individuals (some of which is due to vaccination), and massive reductions in testing."
1100,Teasing all of that apart while also accounting for incoming variants is extremely difficult.
1101,"All signs from Europe suggest that less vaccinated states are about to get hammered, and more vaccinated states may well be too without additional NPIs (this is the uncertain part)."
1102,"Re: Canada, we are also spreading our two doses further than most countries (8-12 weeks versus the typical 2-4 weeks in most places), so I‚Äôm curious how that‚Äôll come into play with efficacy."
1103,Apparently spreading the doses out helps build up greater immunity so I guess we‚Äôll see whether that helps with delta.
1104,Our goverment had also been very clear that this kind of thing would never be implemented here...
1105,[removed]
1106,[removed]
1107,US is the biggest anti free market power in the world.
1108,"Cuba is not blocking other markets, that's on US."
1109,"&gt; I think 30+ should be done with their second shot (so not counting the two weeks for immunity) by end of July

A bit more than that."
1110,"I booked the day it became available for my year, and I'll receive the second shot on the 7th of August."
1111,&gt;	Because the minute one person died from a vaccine no one would take it.
1112,So many countries are actively using AZ and other countries would love to get supply to do so even after rare chance of death was observed.
1113,"Lockdowns should not be implemented to protect against the low possibility of ""long Covid."""
1114,"Long Covid was shown to be correlated with the severity of infection, and since vaccines significantly reduce the severity, it won't be an issue in vaccinated people."
1115,"By this time, unvaccinated people are those that refused the vaccine, and restrictions cannot be left in place to protect them."
1116,WSJ Mirror: https://archive.is/kZURj
1117,Oh no‚Ä¶ Anyway
1118,"Let's be straight with it now, everyone has had the opportunity to have their first dose now."
1119,I appreciate some people are unable to be vaccinated due to health conditions but that is a miniscule number compared to those who have refused to have it based on nothing apart from being ill educated.
1120,Now I do know the vaccine is not 100% effective but overall the at risk groups will be fully vaccinated and even those with 1 jab will have milder symptoms plus will likely be younger anyway so we don't to be too concerned.
1121,For the unvaccinated we already know that generally covid has less of an effect on children (apart from affecting education when isolating) so we don't need to be overly concerned about them.
1122,The 13% of adults that have so far refused the jab are the ones most at risk.
1123,That's about 6.75m adults who will be most at risk.
1124,Now the question is why should we hold back society for a group of people who do not want to help themselves?
1125,I know there are other considerations such as the risk of new variants but on the whole society should not go out of the way to protect antivaxxers after doing their best to persuade them to get jabbed.
1126,We also need to get over this obsession with case numbers.
1127,We have never counted the number of flu cases but only those in hospital/dying.
1128,If we hark back to march 2020 the reason for lockdown was to stop the NHS being overwhelmed.
1129,As long as the NHS is not at risk of being overstretched then we shouldn't be locking down.
1130,"We're not God, we cannot stop death completely and we've offered everyone the best chance of not dying."
1131,People have made choices and they will have to live (or not) with those choices.
1132,Well there were already mandatory vaccines for healthcare works prior to Covid in the U.K. so I‚Äôm sure it was the same elsewhere too.
1133,"Ye it was scary, it took barely more than 1 week to go from 500 to 10000+ cases."
1134,"&gt;The vast majority of positive cases in this country are among the under 35 age group

Yes, because the vulnerable people are vaccinated and therefore not testing positive."
1135,"Thus, the vaccines are working."
1136,Most people don‚Äôt pay attention to shit until it‚Äôs too late.
1137,"Hey man, stay safe out there."
1138,Wear a mask... just in case.
1139,"Take care, my friend."
1140,[deleted]
1141,Belgium : Be positive..
1142,"Few more months and we won‚Äôt have to imagine any more, sadly"
1143,"So, they can spread it without knowing thinking they are safe?"
1144,Hmmm sounds like something I've heard before.
1145,Here in Canada we are absolutely mixing manufacturers and so far zero issues with this
1146,"Basically, it's a lockdown you can unlock with a QR code

I wonder how long till people just hack it."
1147,Black market for lockdown codes etc
1148,Gotcha
1149,They are actively killing their own voter base.
1150,Just out of spite.
1151,Jesus fucking christ.
1152,They have enough Pfizer vaccines and they are vaccinating as fast as they can at the moment.
1153,Their problem is that they started way to late.
1154,When those age groups are vaccinated
1155,Isn‚Äôt Japan behind on vaccinations?
1156,Shouldn‚Äôt they use them?

1161,"Rub it in, why don‚Äôt ya."
1162,But they‚Äôre among a demographic that can weather Covid much better.
1163,"Yes, because right now in the news is a Thai nurse that died of Covid after getting both shots of Sinovac and then something like 600 other nurses have gotten Covid after receiving the Sinovac."
1164,"You have to decide if you are in favor of free markets or communism, in the end, If you would like economic freedom for Cuba maybe you would also want that for their people"
1165,'Difficult to say to what extent the vaccines are working at the moment.
1166,"The vast majority of positive cases in this country are among the under 35 age group, and this being the case you would expect hospitalisations and loss of life to not follow a similar trajectory as earlier phases of the pandemic."
1167,"We've tended to have a 4 to 6 week gap in cases increasing significantly and hospitalisations increasing significantly, and I'd imagine part of that is time to get to the wrong people who aren't out socialising much: I don't think we're quite at the end of that gap."
1168,I think you'll have a better idea as to just how effective the vaccines are at the end of July.
1169,"There are some positive signs, but too early to tell."
1170,"Perhaps more telling is that an increasing number of scientists/virologists/experts are labelling the opening up on the 19th July: ""a huge mistake""."
1171,"&gt;The developers of Russia‚Äôs Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine have repeatedly failed to provide data that regulators deem to be standard requirements of the drug approval process, according to five people with knowledge of European efforts to assess the drug, providing new insight into the country‚Äôs struggle to win foreign acceptance of its product."
1172,"&gt;  
&gt;Reuters reported last month that the European Medicines Agency (EMA)‚Äôs review of the drug‚Äôs safety and efficacy was delayed because a June 10 deadline to submit data on the vaccine's clinical trials was missed, according to one of those people, who is close to the agency, and another person familiar with the matter."
1173,The EMA is the European Union‚Äôs medicines watchdog.
1174,"&gt;  
&gt;The hitches go beyond that one deadline, the person close to the agency said."
1175,"As of early June, the EMA had received hardly any manufacturing data, and the clinical data the agency had received was incomplete, the person said."
1176,"&gt;  
&gt;Separately, an assessment of Sputnik V by a French delegation of scientists in advance of the EMA review found that the vaccine developers were unable to document that the so-called master cell bank, the initial building block of the vaccine, complied with specific EU regulation on preventing disease contamination, according to four people with knowledge of the delegation's findings."
1177,"&gt;  
&gt;The EMA, which launched its formal review of the Russian vaccine in March, had previously been expected to decide in May or June whether to approve use of the drug in the EU.The person close to the EMA said notable missing clinical information during the EMA review included case report forms that record any adverse effects people experienced after receiving the jab in trials."
1178,"It is standard practice for developers to submit such forms, this person added."
1179,"It was also not clear how the scientists working on the vaccine tracked the outcomes of people given a placebo, the person said."
1180,"&gt;  
&gt;The watchdog rates such data shortcomings on a scale that goes from ‚Äúcritical‚Äù - the most serious - to ‚Äúmajor‚Äù to ‚Äúminor.‚Äù The person said nothing had met the critical threshold, ‚Äúbut there are several ‚Äòmajors,‚Äô‚Äù indicating issues that can be remedied but require much work."
1181,The person added they didn‚Äôt expect the review to be completed until after the summer.
1182,"&gt;  
&gt;Several people who have interacted with Russia‚Äôs Gamaleya Institute, which developed Sputnik V and oversaw the clinical trials, attribute the repeated failure to provide some information to lack of experience in dealing with overseas regulators."
1183,"""They are not used to working with a regulatory agency like the EMA,"" the person close to the agency said, referring to Gamaleya‚Äôs scientists.Gamaleya is supervised by Russia‚Äôs health ministry."
1184,"&gt;  
&gt;Neither Gamaleya nor the ministry responded to questions for this report."
1185,The Kremlin declined to comment.
1186,Oh well.
1187,Rest In Peace to free speech and open debate online I guess...
1188,"This is incorrect, because not all age demographics are vaccinated at the same rate."
1189,"Seniors‚Äô vaccination numbers are much higher, so increases in ‚Äúcases‚Äù - even among non-vaccinated folks - don‚Äôt represent the same risk anymore."
1190,"From a NY Magazine article on the subject:

‚ÄúBut on that point mass vaccination in the United States has utterly changed the landscape of the pandemic: not only by protecting those who have received shots, indeed astonishingly well, but by changing the calculus for all those who haven‚Äôt, by eliminating almost all of the mortality risk of the population at large."
1191,"All told, 80 percent of American deaths have been among those 65 and above."
1192,"According to the White House, 90 percent of American seniors are now fully vaccinated."
1193,"Which means that while more cases are likely and some amount of hospitalization and death, as well, vaccines have eliminated the overwhelming share of American mortality risk, with the disease now circulating almost exclusively among people who can endure it much, much better ‚Äî kids especially.‚Äù"

1202,*
1203,This is good and normal.
1204,Try being a healthcare worker anywhere and not get any type vaccine.
1205,Why would you ask for permission ?
1206,It's forbidden to wear a mask in school in Texas ?
1207,Long covid isn‚Äôt that big of a deal to most people.
1208,missed you!
1209,[deleted]
1210,Because thanks to vaccination numbers cases are no longer indicators of hospitalization and death like they were last year.
1211,There are 2 different types antibody tests - one will flag regardless of vaccine/natural but the other will only flag for natural.
1212,It looks at the different types of antibodies you have.
1213,[removed]
1214,I was just answering your question on types of jobs that require it‚Ä¶
1215,All that means is that the doubling rate will be 10 days instead of 7 to 8.
1216,"Have a closer look how sigmoidal curves work for infection spread, you don't see significant flattening until the proportion of the population that is sterilising immune approaches 2x(1/R0)."
1217,"51% vs 39% may sound significant, but in terms of the mathematics of this - well, not so much."
1218,Personally as someone double vaccinated and with myself and partner working from home - and able to do so until at least October- I'm sort of fine with the UK running it's own wee petri dish experiment.
1219,"Delta being Delta and Johnstone willing to kill another 10,000 so he can have a pint then great."
1220,"***Let it burn***, the bigger the peak the better because the other side of it they'll be nowhere for it to go."
1221,"Don't think it's moral though, but that's what the Daily Mail wants and that's what the Daily Mail readers are going to get."
1222,Their funeral.
1223,"We'll hit 200,000 a day by second week of August - though testing might not be able to cope with that so the figures may be artificially depressed."
1224,That's still going to produce an awful lot of long covid and a significant number of deaths.
1225,"Great, fatigued and possibility contagious hospital workers without a sense of smell."
1226,I can‚Äôt imagine *that* could go awry.
1227,You're probably from Alabama lmao
1228,"&gt;  It feels like we all worked so hard to stay home and get vaccinated

Who's this ""we"" you're talking about?"
1229,"Per the CDC, only 60% of adults in California are fully vaccinated."
1230,It's abundantly clear how many people didn't do any of that hard work.
1231,"You want to yell at someone, yell at them, they're why we are where we are."
1232,This post appears to be about vaccines.

1237,"Or the ""makes sense to me"" people.. who somehow use weird circular logic from tucker Carlson to come to a conclusion in their minds"
1238,"Yeah, every single adult that refused to wear masks and social distance, then refused to get vaccinated should feel ashamed that children are having to pick up their slack for their selfishness."
1239,Good thing they‚Äôre reproducing.
1240,Fully vaccinated.
1241,Tested positive yesterday.
1242,Wrong.
1243,Mild is mild.
1244,Moderate is what you describe.
1245,&gt;It's because I would make more money in America for my labor.
1246,Would you?
1247,Relative to the cost of living?
1248,I think not.
1249,&gt;You have things like the 996 work rule - 9 am to 9 pm 6 days a week - to deal with.
1250,Pretty sure many people are working 72 hour weeks in the US as well.
1251,&gt;How can you go from rags to riches when so much of your labor goes to the state and the corrupt?
1252,How is that any different than in the US?
1253,Income inequality in the US is such that much of the wealth you create as a low-income worker goes to a handful of ultra wealthy.
1254,At least China's government is spending huge amounts of money on infrastructure projects and initiatives that are lifting millions of their population out of poverty.
1255,"I can't read [this article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/18/world/asia/china-social-mobility.html) due to the paywall, but the title says enough."
1256,"Again, not singing their praises unconditionally - there is corruption there in spades."
1257,"But we have much to learn from them, and if we don't catch up, China's model is going to take over."
1258,Even some people who were asymptomatic are showing signs of long covid.
1259,This stuff is insidious and gets into the nooks and crannies of brains and organs.
1260,It would be the decent thing to do while cases are high.
1261,"Pandemics don't last forever, I think it'll be another year before we've reached sufficient vaccination levels, natural immunity and had time to research anti viral medication."
1262,I don't see how wearing a mask in public places like a supermarket or public transport has any impact on your day to day life.
1263,That sort of place is essential for everyone and vulnerable people need food and to get to work.
1264,Restaurants and bars etc are different because they're optional and people who go have assessed their own risk and are happy to take it.
1265,Personally I see masks as a common courtesy to others.
1266,"You wouldn't slam the door on a stranger, or drive away after a car accident so why is wearing a mask such a big deal?"
1267,It's just basic human decency.
1268,"What about hospitalizations though not just contracting the Virus, the vaccines are still highly effective against that aren't they ?"
1269,And that was kind of the point of lockdowns to prevent overrunning hospitals.
1270,So if people can catch a mild case of covid with the vaccine I'd say covid becoming relatively harmless is a good thing (if you're vaccinated) but the people who don't are taking a calculated risk and personal choice
1271,Numerous people I know are very sick with delta who have been fully vaccinated for a couple of months.
1272,"The vaccine surely saved their lives, but this tells me that we can't just go running around in crowds and restaurants without masks yet, unless we want to have ""mild covid"" (aka potentially quite sick) every 6 months."
1273,[deleted]
1274,So it's basically mix-and-match?
1275,I have just three words:  Good.
1276,"Let me guess, girls still can‚Äôt wear spaghetti straps though right?"
1277,So much this.
1278,"Currently sitting in a room with half a dozen others in an IBD clinic in Norway getting an IV infusion of a biologic medication and even here, two thirds of the other people aren‚Äôt wearing a mask."
1279,"Just before the start of the summer holiday period, Norway relaxed the mask mandates so now most people just don‚Äôt bother."
1280,It‚Äôs almost like people think there‚Äôs no pandemic.
1281,Just waiting for the delta surge to start‚Ä¶
1282,"Mate, you had no idea about Australia‚Äôs Covid response but made statements like you did... think I give a shit about your opinion on face masks?"
1283,"If anyone that was upset about this was actually concerned about the children, they'd push for mandatory vaccination of adults so that adult community transmission was cut off"
1284,We need it.
1285,"Sadly, it will be too little too late by the time we finally do."
1286,If we do.
1287,i wonder if any districts will be implementing weekly covid testing?
1288,While it won't catch all cases frequent testing will help to stem campus-wide outbreaks.

1312,"The majority of under 28s didn't become eligible until the middle of June, I know because I booked mine the first day it was available."
1313,"I know some had it earlier, I had a friend contacted by his GP."
1314,But most places are not giving second jabs until you've waited at least 8 weeks.
1315,"The logic is not just to do with supply, it's because you develop a stronger immune response if you wait."
1316,Which I agree makes less sense now that we are opening up and the risk of spread is high.
1317,My second dose is booked for 12 weeks after my first jab.
1318,"I can maybe rebook for earlier, but unless they change the rules I probably won't be able to get it before mid August."
1319,I also wonder why Moderna hasn‚Äôt gotten an EUA for 12‚Äì17 yet?
1320,Evangelical Christian Republicans killing their own supporters in order to stick it to the liberals.
1321,They're like a stereotypical supervillain who murders his own henchman to show how tough he is.
1322,Did you die?
1323,r/Angryupvote
1324,Hmz...
1325,I would have hoped you had less severe symptoms.
1326,How are your symptoms now?
1327,Fully recovered?
1328,It‚Äôs not a false dichotomy when now is the best time to open up until next year.
1329,i think it has so much to do with every individual's immune response to the vaccine.
1330,"could be due to medical issues, or genes... who knows."
1331,get better soon!
1332,"sounds like you are going through a regular cold, thank goodness!"
1333,That‚Äôs exactly the point I made
1334,Weird.
1335,My first thought was the chicken pox comment was a joke so I laughed.
1336,I had it as a kid and it was just itchya ND annoying.
1337,Had no clue it made you seriously sick as you got older.
1338,Glad my kids are vaccinated against it.
1339,Now we just have to hope we also don't get shingles when we're even older.
1340,Fucking chicken pox.
1341,That global minimum tax thing sounds better by the day.
1342,I haven't been able to smell since November
1343,From what I gather viral load has a lot to do with it.
1344,"It‚Äôs not just whether or not you catch it, it‚Äôs how much you catch."
1345,The original version needed about 100 viral particles before infection could really take hold.
1346,"One study showed that people that wore masks had weaker and less serious infections than people that didn‚Äôt, because even if the mask wasn‚Äôt completely effective, it reduced how much they inhaled."
1347,I think that accounts for a lot of difference between cases.
1348,The Delta variant is another matter.
1349,"It is super infectious, which likely means fewer particles are more likely to infect you, and to a greater degree."
1350,The hospitalization rate for unvaccinated people is like double.
1351,Am I reading this right that even though they're vaccinated that they're still infected?
1352,Meaning that they can still infect others?
1353,"Their bite is painful but not dangerous, unlike the black widow, so the black widow being replaced is good for humans"
1354,The funny thing is the people that most want things to get back to normal do the least to help it get back to normal.
1355,"(Vaccinate, wear masks, social distance when necessary)"
1356,[removed]
1357,It was equivalent to a really bad flu for me.
1358,Day 1 started noticing general malaise and cough.
1359,Day 2 symptoms for worse but no fever so didn‚Äôt think I he COVID yet.
1360,"Fever hit day 3, went to the doctor and got a positive covid test."
1361,Dosed up on Tylenol and cold meds and passed out.
1362,Day 4 and 5 were the worst.
1363,Night sweats but fever started to go away.
1364,Sense of smell disappeared like a light switch.
1365,I felt a few brief instances of the suffocating feeling that COVID patients describe.
1366,Oxygen levels dipped to 93 at this time.
1367,Not lower than the 90 where you would want to consider going back to a doctor but worrisome.
1368,Day 6 started to feel better and Day 7 tested negative so took myself out of bedroom quarantine.
1369,I‚Äôm on Day 18 and Im probably 90% back to normal.
1370,Still have a bit of a lingering cough and there‚Äôs some wheezing.
1371,Sense of smell appears to be coming back but super slowly.
1372,I can only smell traces of strong scents like perfume or cologne.
1373,Definitely think the vaccine helped reduce the severity of my symptoms.
1374,"if they really want it, do a freaking proper trial."
1375,the other 90% = corruption
1376,My state sadly never really had masking mandates.
1377,Several cities did but fucking governor sued these cities.
1378,"The ""misleading"" tag says ""MILD, NOTASYMPTOMATIC."""
1379,But is that true?
1380,I though most cases of all coronavirus were asymptomatic?
1381,Is it different for the Delta variant?
1382,"I get that the WHO says ""mild or asymptomatic"" for it, but still... aren't the majority of cases actually asymptomatic?"
1383,&gt;That doesn‚Äôt seem‚Ä¶ off‚Ä¶ to anyone else?
1384,"If you‚Äôve made sex work safe in your country, why is it so reliant upon imported poor women?"
1385,American porn is full of Americans.
1386,Australian strip clubs are staffed by Australians.
1387,German sex workers are ‚Ä¶ imported from much poorer countries.
1388,We have free travel and work in the EU so you can move everywhere in the EU to do a job.
1389,"This and thanks to making sex work legal, many people from poorer EU countries came to make a buck."
1390,This let the competition explode and the prices fall and this makes sex work not as lucrative for German people as it has been.
1391,Why should you work in the sex business when you only get 30 Euro per fuck while you could use our social security system that feeds you and give you a roof over your head.
1392,The narrative in the post or the overall narrative?
1393,Like I said I tuned out because of being mentally exhausted by the subject after I got my second dose.
1394,[removed]
1395,It‚Äôs the right thing to do.
1396,No one wants another shutdown.
1397,Other countries will follow suit and international travel restrictions will start.
1398,"Good listen, highly recommend."
1399,&gt; 95 percent vs 96 percent... big difference.
1400,"Biden didn't get 95%, he got 93% of the vote."
1401,"And again, that doesn't mean 93% of the population belongs to the democratic party, just that 93% of the people there voted for Biden over Trump."
1402,The voting population isn't the same as the entire population.
1403,DC is 76% democratic per official voting record statistics.
1404,Math shouldn't be this hard for you.

1521,"Covid from what I‚Äôve been reading throughout, isn‚Äôt limited to the lungs."
1522,"Someone else linked this article from Singapore on a study about persistent symptoms 6 months after infection: [article](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/1-in-10-recovered-covid-19-patients-in-spore-suffers-persistent-symptoms-six-months-after)

Elevated inflammatory markers were found in people who experienced either mild or severe disease which are associated with issues with the circulatory system and leads to elevated risks for cardiovascular disease."
1523,Sometimes people will blindly follow government for everything.
1524,I bet you mixed your doses because they told you so.
1525,They can get it and carry it home to infect their parents or teachers.
1526,"Some kids actually die of COVID-19 but it is thankfully rare, as is the transmission."
1527,"[Asymptomatic kids don't seem to be such a high risk](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2775656) but by their nature, a school operating without precautions is very high risk."
1528,No
1529,"It's never been mandatory here in sweden, but those in elderly care got offered one prioritized/early."
1530,Good and honest information about the vaccines has been enough for us to get a sufficient coverage.
1531,"Infection spread at hospitals has been lower than many other workplaces (not to mention parties and households), so it's not made any sense to priority those in general."
1532,"Look at her eyebrows dude, dead giveaway"
1533,That‚Äôs crazy.
1534,It‚Äôs been like hunger games since April to try and book a vaccine.
1535,"People showing up to pop up clinics at 3am and waiting hours... people having to rely on Twitter, Reddit etc to find pharmacies.. it‚Äôs been a terrible rollout"
1536,There are still way too little people fully vaccinated to start another round of this shit now...
1537,Nothing burger‚Ä¶ You can literally change Moderna in the title for any other company name.

1539,Why are people downvoting?
1540,This is a valid question
1541,Because we have something called vaccines?
1542,It's possible that I completely misread the comment.
1543,Wouldn't be the first time.
1544,Exactly.
1545,It's part of Basic Human Rights to not be forced to undergo any kind of medicinal procedure.
1546,"You dont have to, unless you've been banned from wearing something like an n95 mask?"
1547,"Right, but then to say we don‚Äôt have Pfizer because delays are disingenuous."
1548,They don‚Äôt have Pfizer supply because they didn‚Äôt order enough for everyone to get it a second time.
1549,"Yeah just to be clear here, I‚Äôm not predicting apocalypse or anything."
1550,"The vaccines will just be a bit less effective and we will all have to be a bit more careful, that‚Äôs all."
1551,"From what I‚Äôve seen, the Astra Zeneca shot May actually do a better job with T cells."
1552,"People who get an Astro Zeneca shot first and the Moderna shot second wind up having fairly competitive antibody levels, but double the T cell levels."
1553,The mRNA vaccine makers put a ‚Äúlock‚Äú on the protein spike to stop it from changing shape when it connects to a cell.
1554,That seems to have really helped our immune systems effectively build up lots of antibodies against it.
1555,"But my (totally speculative) theory is that by allowing the spikes to connect to cells, the Astra Zeneca shot actually gave our immune systems more opportunity for T cells to learn how to handle infected cells."
1556,"When the original trials came out, the Pfizer shots were new and at their peak, so everybody was dazzled by the antibody action, which seem to give sterilizing immunity."
1557,"The high T cell count in the Astra Zeneca shot seemed like a booby prize in comparison, and nobody cared; why worry about T cell reaction if another vaccine can stop you from getting sick in the first place?"
1558,"But as you said, the T cell response probably lasts a lot longer."
1559,"Which means that in the long run, the Astra Zeneca shot could actually be a bit more effective, or at least more competitive than most people think."
1560,"By the way, there is some very early evidence that the Moderna  shot may turn out to be longer lasting than the Pfizer."
1561,They use triple the dose of mRNA.
1562,"Initially, that kind of seemed like overkill that led to stronger side effects."
1563,But it‚Äôs possible the Delta variant needs such a big antibody response to tackle it effectively that the Moderna begins to get the edge.
1564,"But it‚Äôs hard to tell because that vaccine wasn‚Äôt as widespread early on, and when it was used in the UK they usually mixed and matched it with the Astra Zeneca, making it hard to do direct comparisons."
1565,Take all that with a grain of salt though.
1566,I‚Äôm no medical doctor.
1567,At this point are you not more concerned about the lasting effect of the trauma on children?
1568,I lived through a hard childhood and I continue to struggle as an adult because of it.
1569,I can‚Äôt imagine a lot of kids won‚Äôt end up with a lot of mental health problems later on because of all this.
1570,"I understand for a period it was unavoidable to protect the most vulnerable, but children are more vulnerable to lasting mental health problems than covid."
1571,Month or two.
1572,"Nope, asshole monkeys gunna be assholes."
1573,Your reading comprehension needs work.

1576,&gt;**The reality is that half our country is basically insane and believe nothing that is real.
1577,"** 

At this point, they will not believe anything until they suffer a personal loss from COVID."
1578,There is no shortage of vaccines and everyone currently has an opportunity to go get one.
1579,"Unless you recommend that the government forcibly  vaccinate them, they are not getting vaccinated of their own accord until they get COVID

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The CDC are not dealing with  that unfortunate reality when they are creating these policies."
1580,I don't think the CDC has any other option other than a recommendation for continued masking and social distancing as has been the case throughout the lockdown period.
1581,CDC couldnt enforce any of their own recomendation at the height of the lockdown during the series of waves we had.
1582,Lockdown only worked in the states that took them seriously and that is because the residents of the states collectively did what needed to be done.
1583,You really think anyone is listening to CDC reccomendations right now other than when they want to?
1584,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And btw- delta is a problem for those of us vaccinated."
1585,So they didn‚Äôt even follow the fucking science on this one.
1586,the vaccine protects the inoculated from serious illness from the look of things.
1587,and the delta variant is really not [spreading equally across the entire country](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/new-cases-50-states) and the vaccines are the most likely causal variable here.
1588,Are you dinging CDC for the vaccine not perfectly preventing infection?
1589,"No vaccine has ever been perfect and preventing infection, ever."
1590,"So in my own opinion, CDC made a reasonable recommendation for the sane members of society."
1591,"If the rest of society chose to use CDC's recommendation as an indulgence not to protect themselves and their community, after the fucking year we have been through, nothing is going to get to them, unless we forcibly vaccinate them for their own good."
1592,"Hospitalizations are rising fast, actually‚Ä¶"
1593,"I mean random people can say whatever they want, but zero covid is never going to happen so somebody waiting for that is going to have to eventually decide if waiting forever really makes sense."
1594,There‚Äôs been a lot of psychological damage from this and some people may take longer than others to return to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù but all evidence points to little to no need to worry for people who have been vaccinated.
1595,"If the health agencies recommend a booster for you, get it."
1596,"If you know somebody‚Äôs sick, steer clear (which I always did anyway)."
1597,"I‚Äôm a fairly big germaphobe, and this is how I‚Äôve been conducting myself since I got vaccinated and most of the people around me did, and plan on continuing to conduct myself this way unless something drastically, completely unexpected happens."
1598,It‚Äôs not worth missing life worrying about covid at this point.
1599,"Not when you factor in long covid, which for some reason everyone is forgetting about."

1780,Not because government did a good job with the rollout.
1781,I shouldn‚Äôt have to rely on discord servers for information
1782,There's consensus among top public health officials that a booster probably isn't needed and there certainly isn't enough data to say otherwise.

1802,"I, and most of the science teachers I know, put the best effort we can out there for our students, but it extremely difficult to overcome what they are raised to believe."
1803,"&gt; When do you think we will reach the point (in the United States) where we can basically shrug and say of unvaccinated people, ‚ÄúOh well, they‚Äôre taking their chances?‚Äù

I'm already there."
1804,Not sure what else we're supposed to do.
1805,"It sucks, they're putting themselves and others at risk, but it is what it is."
1806,Public debate and rational analysis require good faith arguing.
1807,"This stuff works in things like science, but falls apart in public because so many people are acting in bad faith and just either don't know how to argue or analyze things rationally or just don't care."
1808,I'd get the booster tomorrow if it were permitted.
1809,Unfortunately here in the U.S. they claim to be waiting for evidence that the vaccine is faltering so that will probably be too late for at least some vulnerable folks.
1810,Watching for the latest Israeli data and hoping that the CDC is proactive when the time comes.
1811,They lag by about 3 weeks in the other waves and UK cases have been growing for over a month and a half at this point.
1812,My parents live there.
1813,I was finally able to visit recently.
1814,"I would venture to say that out of a weeklong stay, other than myself......I saw maybe 2-3 people wearing a mask."
1815,We're pretty much there already but kids still aren't eligible.
1816,I think once they are then we'll really be in that position.
1817,[removed]
1818,"My guess is we will hear ‚ÄúThe original Moderna shot doesn‚Äôt work well against the _____ variant, so I‚Äôm waiting for Moderna 2.0 to be fully approved‚Äù"
1819,I guess we will see in the coming weeks.
1820,I'd be glad to hear your predictions and we can check back and see if you were right.
1821,"According to CDC stats, of 70 million vaccinated Americans only ~5,000 cases have occurred in those vaccinated."
1822,So if you‚Äôre not vaccinated I can see the concern but if you are there really is no need.
1823,"I'm hopeful, but seeing Israel put up 1,000+ cases today with their mask mandate, and vaccines, doesn't give me the warm fuzzies."
1824,"Sometimes people will edit maliciously, for example posting something in an abusive or argumentative tone, then editing it later to make it seem like those responding are being unreasonable, so I'm guessing it's to make it clear that the edit didn't change the content or tone of the post."
1825,-even the ones who support the lies and conspiracies have gotten their vaccine!
1826,"Whats up with state agencies in California coming up with these mandates, then backing off and/or changing them immediately after?"
1827,"First CAL-OSHA with their policy of 'if even one person is unvaccinated in a workplace, everyone has to wear masks,' now this."
1828,Its almost like a little bit of critical thinking or common sense before sending these mandates out to the public?
1829,"How can they not see it would cause a backlash from districts, cities and counties?"
1830,[removed]
1831,Yeah.
1832,"I think we‚Äôve done a Bush ‚ÄúMission Accomplished‚Äù error here when instead of dealing with apples to apples, we are dealing with apples to apple pears."
1833,Delta is different enough to original SARS2 from an R0 and mortality standpoint to treat this year‚Äôs situation as differently as we treat influenza year on year.
1834,Edit: apple pears are delicious.
1835,Shaped like an apple with an apple crunch.

1841,&gt; Post vax covid is NOT less deadly than a flu season.
1842,"It would be if there was higher uptake, especially amongst the old, which is the point that started this discussion."
1843,"It is so far, the 2019 flu season was about 350 deaths per day."
1844,I guess we will see how that develops.
1845,It's not like more people can't get vaccinated going forward if they see others dying of covid.
1846,And a lot of kids will be getting it after the vaccine is approved for them.
1847,"Even if it does turn out to be a bit deadlier than an average flu season long term, I don't expect anyone is locking anything down for it."

1852,Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) if you have any questions or concerns.
1853,*
1854,"Vaccinated individuals certainly have a good amount of protection, but can still get infected and transmit it to others."
1855,"So while you may not need to worry (much) about yourself getting seriously ill, there is still some concern for others."
1856,"An observation that I noticed today:  both New Jersey and New York's rate of transmissions both creeked over 1, but the case numbers in both cases are still nowhere near winter surge levels."
1857,Not even close.
1858,"Jersey today recorded only 333 cases, while New York recorded sub 800, according to the NY Times."
1859,So MAYBE there's a chance that neither state will experience the same surge that the unvaccinated regions are.
1860,I floated this very idea on this sub last week and was told I sounded like a dictator.
1861,"Schizophrenic, this sub is."
1862,"ah my bad, as the op said ""80% of eligible population"" I thought they were well ahead."
1863,Which part of California?
1864,Both restrictions and voluntary compliance differed greatly in different parts of the state.
1865,More evidence??
1866,the CEO needs a third mega yacht for his 2nd mistress.
1867,What more evidence do you need!
1868,!
1869,It has a lot to do with underlying conditions.

1871,"If I remember correctly they tested 3 different dosages 50, 250, 500 or something like that (I forgot the units) 50 wasn‚Äôt enough and 500 was too strong."
1872,Pfizer tested 100 which was perfect.
1873,Cuz of  Modernas stronger dose it has more significant side effects
1874,"Likely coined by the same people who describe leaving the EU as ""independence""."
1875,I haven't seen a whole lot of people getting ill who have been fully vaccinated.
1876,The CDC guidelines haven't changed.
1877,I don't think they will in the areas where vaccination rates are high and cases are low.
1878,There's no need to do that.
1879,But in the event things get bad again... perhaps.
1880,"That said, mask mandates are in no way going to be permanent."
1881,It would be totally impractical to do that.
1882,They are going to end someday.
1883,We are NOT gonna do this forever.
1884,"As to whether we need boosters, the jury's still out on that."
1885,ITT heads exploding as people realiize their values are in alignment with fucking Turkmenistan.
1886,I was just gobsmacked when everyone was harping on the original -80F storage requirement.
1887,Because while the average person doesn't run into a -80F capable freezer.
1888,There are literally millions of those laying around.
1889,We have one at work that we barely use.
1890,It's like you plug it into a standard outlet and set the temp to -60C.
1891,Seriously lots of people are grasping at straws looking for reasons the situation is hopeless.
1892,"At least the sputnik part paid off, if I could get it right now I would rather than waiting ‚â§2 weeks or so before my vaccine (I'm 23 and the queues are full)."
1893,"Not trying to be pro-Orb√°n here, just arguing that the Hungarian strategy of using as many vaccines as possible allowed the country to achieve herd immunity faster than other countries."
1894,"Of course the delta variant is now inbound to ruin everything, so who knows what will happen.."

&gt;**The French Rush For Vaccines After They're Told They'll Need Them To Go To Cafes**  
&gt;  
&gt;A record number of French citizens booked vaccine shots Monday after French President Emmanuel Macron said that starting in August, anyone who wants to visit cafes, bars or shopping centers must show a ""health pass"" that certifies they've been vaccinated or recently tested negative for the coronavirus."
1902,"Ah, you and your efficient centralized systems."
1903,How dare you.
1904,Thanks for the source!
1905,We just have to decide what hospitalization/death rates are acceptable for these kids and go from there.
1906,"Care to throw out what you think are some ""acceptable"" numbers?"
1907,Sentence seems lite.
1908,This person is willfully and contumaciously endangering every single person that comes into contact with them.
1909,Acts like this shatter the social contract that is already barely holding things together as is.
1910,"If I got onto a train with a concealed weapon, I bet the punishment would be greater than a year..."
1911,You're spot-on about this.
1912,There is also a lot of creep from the conspiracy subs.
1913,Always check the user's post history before going down a rabbit hole with a potential antivaxxer.
1914,"This is what I'm wondering, but I've seen a lot of reports (at least via random commenters on reddit) of the vaccine helping with long-term symptoms."
1915,But my understanding of vaccines leads me to believe it makes no sense unless exactly what you describe here is actually happening.
1916,"Vaccines aren't any sort of cure, it's just preparing your body for the real thing."
1917,I feel if you're changing a grammatical/spelling error or rewriting a sentence to make it more clear to understand but your overall statement is the same you dont need to say you edited it or if you edit it within a few minutes of posting and no one has commented and only a few upvotes you're good to not say anything and just make the edit.
1918,"However, if you add new information it should be part of an added edit and clarified to everyone it's an edit."
1919,If you change your original statement to something different you should use strikethroughs and clarify in the edit.
1920,Sometimes my phone will make some weird autocorrections that I dont catch initially.
1921,I'll just go back and fix them without saying anything.
1922,"no worries, have a nice day!"
1923,"Not to dissuade anyone from getting their vaccine, but, it would reduce the risk, statistically speaking, but not necessarily in their individual, own body, level."
1924,"What is concerning is if, where you live, your government has a good enough support system for people who had severe reactions to vaccines, since you can‚Äôt hold pharmaceuticals accountable."
1925,[removed]
1926,I did that in the fall and spring and it was a nightmare.
1927,"If my mother in law couldnt my sister would but somedays I had no childcare, maybe an hour, or someone showing up late or me having to pick him up early."
1928,It wasn't reliable and honestly most days i had to just watch him or spent more time driving him to one place or the other than i had to work.
1929,"Also, since everyone was like ""working from home is easy"" I had comments and very little support and it was assumed I could do it all without help."
1930,"It was miserable and with me working in person now, not at all realistic."
1931,Just thinking of another semster like the last one has me crying and mentally unstable.

1934,"There is context though, the numbers are listed in the third line of the article."
1935,"Every unvaccinated person is more chances for the virus to mutate, that's why they're a problem."
1936,"If the situation was such that a vaccine-resistant strain developing was literally impossible, I would be more than willing to let them yeet themselves after everyone else is vaccinated, but that's not the case."
1937,"I suppose it's theoretically possible that her immune system didn't learn to fight Covid until an mRNA vaccine ""forced"" it to learn."
1938,"Still seems more likely to be placebo effect, though."
1939,I wrote that badly.
1940,I was riffing on the comment above me and trying to point out that she wasn‚Äôt fired for trying to get teens vaccinated but merely for trying to ensure that they be allowed to decide for themselves if want to get vaccinated.
1941,Prolly wasn‚Äôt fully awake when I wrote it.
1942,It does.
1943,I know at least 1 parent of an under 12 kid who is extremely hesitant about vaccinating his boy especially with news of some boys experiencing heart inflammation as a side effect.
1944,Having statistics on the other side of the decision (0.01% boys with heart inflammation vs. 0.1% boys under 12 end up in ICU) is vitally important to sway the reluctant parent.
1945,[removed]
1946,"&gt; This kind of thing is why I want my kids vaccinated despite it popular on here for people to say stuff like ""kids don't get sick""."
1947,This sub over the past few months has been flooded with No New Normal folks pretending to act in good faith to make people drop their guard.
1948,"I'm not saying that we should be scared hermits, and never leave our houses, but there is definitely a concerted effort by folks here to downplay every new concern, even if legitimate."
1949,"There is no need to be super paranoid, but there is also no need to completely disregard considerations for public health and safety as some here would have you believe."
1950,I would also like to see data on the ages of people getting infected and how different it might be from past waves.
1951,Probably 15 minutes before closing as you need to remain for observation for 15 minutes.
1952,[deleted]
1953,"mRNA is a blueprint for proteins, not made of proteins."
1954,Yeah same here in AZ.
1955,I'm fully vaccinated but my wife and son cant (autoimmune) and daughter too young.
1956,So i continue to wear a mask everywhere and social distance myself.. but its hard when 90% of the people at the store/cvs/etc are maskless.
1957,I can only do so much and just hope i dont bring anything home to my kids.
1958,Like you i would be crushed if one of  them ended up in the hospital.
1959,"Odd, I did not see that as accusatory."
1960,It doesn't have to be intentional for it to be misinformation.
1961,"Since you already had it, and had even been vaccinated over that, it‚Äôs very unlikely it will affect you the same way."
1962,But it depends a lot on if you have other conditions.
1963,[deleted]
1964,That entire party does nothing but let the loudest dipshits in their base drive them.
1965,They‚Äôve been allergic to leadership.
1966,So ridiculous
1967,"Not same, this was in Porto Alegre, Brazil."
1968,It's probably more common than people think.

2021,And who cares if their reasons are pathetic?
2022,"When the alternative is swathes of unvaccinated people filling up hospitals, the reasoning does not matter."
2023,I'm not advocating we wear masks during a flu season.
2024,That's a disingenuous argument.
2025,"You brought up flu, a much, much less deadly disease."
2026,"I said here's a distinct difference between flu and coronavirus, one is really transmissible and exponentially spreads in environments with significant vaccination and mitigation, and another is almost eradicated by basic hygeine and masking."
2027,The comparison between the two is absurd.
2028,Post vax covid is NOT less deadly than a flu season.
2029,"It would be if there was higher uptake, especially amongst the old, which is the point that started this discussion."
2030,"You've ignored the fact that our death rate at approximately 250/day right now is already higher than an average flu season, and that our death rate is at a minimum right now, and will be increasing for months, then again in the winter."
2031,Co-worker had COVID last year.
2032,She did not get vaccinated because she's a crazy anti-vaxxer and spews bullshit about them.
2033,Anyways... she had covid last year and now someone who lives in her home was just tested positive.
2034,What are the guidelines since she's been re-exposed?
2035,Back testing against the same case levels last year reveals a 93% reduction in deaths.
2036,Which is awesome.
2037,Until you continue looking at the peak and comparing the social restrictions in place at that time vs. the social restrictions that are/will be in place when we peak this time.
2038,The peak in MO was a 7-day moving average of 85 deaths per day and 5.5k infections.
2039,"All signs indicated this spread is worse, and the political support for lockdowns at an all time low."
2040,Best case scenario MO is barreling towards 50 deaths per week.
2041,Without masks or any sort of lockdowns?
2042,Good luck keeping that number under 100.

2050,I am certain you could get a third shot if you really felt you needed one and I don‚Äôt think it would be particularly hard to get.

2058,"I will wear a mask if I'm feeling under the weather or if it's required in the venue I'm in, and still make an effort to give people space, especially if they're wearing masks which means they're either unvaccinated or vaccinated and still concerned."
2059,I think we can get through this if we just respect other people and their choices.
2060,The biggest source of stress for me lately has been people trying to force others to do this or that.

2062,"Sure, but only within reasonable boundaries."
2063,so im reading that booster shots for the variants are coming out.
2064,i got covid a month or so ago so i was waiting to get the vaccine per doctors suggestion.
2065,i had planned on getting it next month but now i'm wondering if i should just wait for the booster to come out since it seems like they are in advance trials for that one?
2066,what do you guys think?
2067,would i even be allowed to get the booster if i haven't got the original vaccine?
2068,Unsure why you're getting downvoted.
2069,We need to shift focus from total case #s to # hospitalizations and break down by vaccinated/not.
2070,"If COVID spreads around but it doesn't do much to people, then we're looking at influenza pre-2020."
2071,I live in Florida.
2072,I refuse to send my kids back until they are full vaccinated and I can forget how many parents were clamoring for no masks.
2073,"I think realistically, we shouldn‚Äôt except vaccines for kids to be approved under emergency authorization."
2074,The numbers don‚Äôt justify an emergency for kids under 12.
2075,Full FDA approval would happen sometime in 2022.
2076,We‚Äôre still finding safety issues with vaccines under EUA.
2077,The J&amp;J vaccine [was just found](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/fda-adds-warning-about-rare-reaction-to-jj-covid-19-vaccine) to cause a rare neurological reaction.

2079,"To approve it for kids, they need to be absolutely sure there is a net benefit."
2080,"Yep, I've said before."
2081,"There's extremely strong correlation between people who are very religious and people who are anti-vaxxers, and we really can't ignore than elephant in the room anymore."

2083,they gonna get screwed eventually
2084,"I think ""not requiring hospitalization"" could work well to put it into perspective."
2085,Breakthrough odds change significantly with Delta.

Singapore shows 69% against infection."
2090,"So we land somewhere between 64% and 88%, likely somewhere in the middle."
2091,Some of the best studies come from Singaporean contact tracers.
2092,"Singapore has high vaccination rates with mRNA and they‚Äôre still seeing tons of asymptomatic spread even via fully-vaccinated individuals:¬†¬†¬†https://twitter.com/michaelzlin/status/1409707511519748102?s=21

2093,Not for kids under 12.
2094,"You know that, right?"
2095,The sample size of cases is extremely small.
2096,"166 is the sample size (remember, they are trying to compare the effect of vaccination vs. not being vaccinated), and then sub groups from that broken down into 1 dose, 2 doses, and time frames after those."
2097,"again, that's why there's a massive, gigantic 95% confidence range."

2106,Why should we accept getting covid?

2214,Someone is far more likely to report a death after a COVID vaccine than a flu vaccine even if the death is completely unrelated - simply because it is more novel and interesting - and due to the ongoing misinformation campaign around them.

2377,"The worst increases from the prior week's pace were in Los Angeles, Santa Clara and Riverside counties."
2378,"&gt;In California, 282 people were reported dead of COVID-19 in the week ending Sunday."
2379,"In the week before that, 158 people were were reported dead."
2380,That's not a decline.
2381,If you believe Cuban propaganda then sure lol
2382,"A vaccinated nanny is one option for less exposure but can be more money for less time, and then it‚Äôs all about how much you trust that one person (and no benefits of the social side of day care)."
2383,"I feel you though, this shit has been LONG and now more isolating as people with no or older kids are vaccinated and back to some normalcy."
2384,"Like I don‚Äôt fault my friends who stayed home got vaccines and now can live a little, but it that‚Äôs not my family‚Äôs reality."
2385,I am not trying to sound rude but you are definitely generalizing there.
2386,What do you mean by we?
2387,There is almost no community in the US that thinks homogenously about public policy.
2388,"I have plenty of friends in Vermont, one just came over last week and we went out to the bars and got drunk."
2389,We didn't cough in anyone's faces.
2390,But we are both vaccinated so we don't really care.
2391,"If we get sick, we will stay home then."
2392,Hospitalizations and deaths are still decreasing despite the recent surge.
2393,If you can really call it a surge when compared to what happened last Fall.
2394,Countries with high vaccination rates aren‚Äôt slightly fucked though - they‚Äôre completely fine?
2395,Huh!
2396,That's awesome you are considering another point of view.
2397,Rare.
2398,"I would say that Sweden is still limited by supply, but probably not for long."
2399,We are close to the end of that.
2400,These same people already are anti-vaxxers for vaccines that have been around for years before covid.
2401,They are just using the 'not approved' approach now because it gets the most normal people nervous.
2402,They will go to something else as mentioned as their minds are already all made up.
2403,Why is Taiwan's Death/Case Ratio so high?
2404,"Even accounting for a lag of 2 weeks, it is still at the 5-10% range."
2405,"There was a School Board meeting this week where I live, a bunch of antimask parents organized a group, it was ridiculous."
2406,"One woman actually claimed masks give you urinary tract infections, facial deformities, and the need for dental surgery."
2407,"One mom brought her kid up there he spoke and cried saying masks were the reason he couldn't do anything this past year, and ""their stupid."""
2408,"Like half of them went on antivax rants, while not wearing masks, in a crowded room."
2409,"In our state if you are on School Grounds, and unvaccinated, you are supposed to wear a mask."
2410,They constantly verbally attacked Teachers as if they are the reason for the existing mandate in our state.
2411,&gt; talk about this policy or actually enforce it.
2412,There were faculty and security guards at the entrance to the school my kid goes to last year enforcing masks at pickup/drop off.
2413,Made parents go back to their car and get a mask.
2414,They absolutely enforced the mask rule for students/faculty but also parents at pickup and drop off
2415,Russian government surreptitiously eats crow...
2416,Nah this guy is pathetic.

2418,"UK real-world data for Pfizer against Delta (you're welcome, we got plague-riddled so you don't have to) is [96% reduction in baseline risk of hospitalisation](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/vaccines-highly-effective-against-hospitalisation-from-delta-variant)."
2419,"Those are obviously extraordinarily, unbelievably good odds, but there is going to be a small number of super fucking unlucky people this happens to."
2420,"It's totally reasonable to point out how rare this is, but I also think it's good to be kind and not do stuff like implying people who say they got super fucking unlucky are lying."
2421,Our responses to the pandemic are economically unsustainable.
2422,Whether the right time to end restrictions is now or later doesn't change the fact that we're reaching the point where we can't afford them anyway.
2423,"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/symptoms/flu-vs-covid19.htm#:~:text=For%20young%20children%2C%20especially%20children,even%20in%20healthy%20young%20children."
2424,"&gt;For young children, especially children younger than 5 years old, the risk of serious complications is higher for flu compared with COVID-19."
2425,"However, serious COVID-19 illness resulting in hospitalization and death can occur even in healthy young children."
2426,"&gt;Compared to young children, teens and adolescents with COVID-19 are more likely to have Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), a rare but severe complication of COVID-19."
2427,"However, for adolescents, the risk of serious COVID-19 illness is less than in children younger than 5.

did you live in constant fear of the flu prior to covid?"
2428,"if not, there's no reason you should now."
2429,What would the point even be?
2430,lmao ok
2431,Delta is the wrench that truly fucked it up.
2432,"Without that we were close to a point for me where daycare was‚Ä¶ something to consider, if rates were low enough, staff vaccinated and masked."
2433,"Between it seemingly causing way more breakthrough cases and impacting kids more, it‚Äôs a no for me once again."
2434,"We hired a teacher for some hours each week of basically outdoor child care, which is better than nothing, but we‚Äôre really just gonna hang in there till vaccines are available for kids."
2435,The problem is we in the UK are probably approaching the maximum take-up when it comes to vaccines.
2436,"87% of all adults have received at least one dose, 66% two doses."
2437,The remaining 13% of adults are probably never going to get vaccinated for one reason or another.
2438,"By mid August the vast majority of single-dosers will have got their second doses as well, brining us to approx 87% adult coverage."
2439,"We aren't vaccinating children under 18, so there's no further room for vaccination coverage growth after mid August."
2440,"As others have said, best to open now and time the wave in the summer rather than in the Autumn or Winter."
2441,"If not now, then there's **never** a good time, unless we take the decision to vaccinate all children (who make up a big chunk of the population)."
2442,I‚Äôm not saying anyone else is definitively wrong I‚Äôm taking a skeptical role and saying we can‚Äôt know anything with certainty.
2443,That places the burden of proof directly on anyone who thinks we can say something with a greater degree of certainty.
2444,People back then weren‚Äôt made psychotic by internet propaganda and were actually likely to know someone personally affected by Polio.
2445,My youngest is starting Kindergarten this August.
2446,She's been wearing a mask since the start of covid last year with no problem keeping it on at all when we go out and about
2447,"Haha yeah with my asthma history, I have been taking COVID seriously."
2448,It's not as bad as when I was a kid but I'm not about to screw around and find out what COVID can do to me.
2449,"So you start out with a cause of death argument, and then build your case based on admission practices?"
2450,Brain cells?
2451,"The CDC has not recommended a third shot, only Pfizer."
2452,"CDC atm recommends two doses, and they are reviewing studies about a third."

2454,"Remember, I was just supporting someone else who YOU tried to prove wrong, so it's you who needs to provide sources, to prove HIM wrong."
2455,The anti-vaxxers have already been doing their best to give Polio a new chance at life again.
2456,"It's fucking disturbing these parents are willingly placing their children in the line of fire for highly preventable diseases because they're convinced they can cause ""autism""."

2458,"That's fair, but we don't have a problem with virus spread/cases where we are."
2459,"In fact, we don't have a masking order in the state anymore so the schools can't require a mask"
2460,That was a thing when I was in middle school in 95.
2461,"No Spaghetti straps or bra straps because it was ""distracting to the boys"" when really it was the pervy male teachers"
2462,I see what you‚Äôre saying.
2463,It‚Äôll definitely be interesting to see how something like a winter surge amongst unvaccinated communities will be reacted to by the general population.
2464,"I really hope it doesn‚Äôt lead us to shutdowns of any sort, as long as areas with high vaccination rates (I think my city just hit 70%+) remain open and let those dealing with the surges make their own decisions."
2465,"Localized shutdowns probably should have been used from the start, especially when places like Texas shut down when NY had their big surge, so by the time Texas saw a real surge, they were already fatigued of lockdowns."
2466,Localizing the nuclear options like shutdowns should be the mode of thinking moving forward I hope.
2467,And its this or ... get a delta surprise *(and a political+economical disaster)*
2468,My answer for my hypothetical question would be the same as yours.
2469,I still think he should be punished harder for risking that scenario to happen.
2470,I have a friend that ranted about vaccines for months.
2471,One time she asked me why I didnt argue with her even though I was quite obviously very pro vaccine.
2472,"Simple, as soon as you are even mildly inconvenienced you'll get it."
2473,"Just like people who rant about any new technology, very few people actually hold out."
2474,She got it about 1 month after me.
2475,People are predictable.
2476,I am sorry to hear that.
2477,üé∂ Let the ~~eagle~~ cases soooooar!
2478,&gt; Privately funded schools would be exempt.

2483,Earlier Fauci himself affirmed that of Indian vaccine - Covaxin's ability to neutralize 617 variant successfully.
2484,Now FDA rejects the Covaxin's emergency use authorization citing insufficient data and advised to apply for full license.
2485,Why is this happening now?
2486,Is FDA biased towards certain decisions or Fauci is just playing silly?
2487,Sounds pretty German innit
2488,Some diseases we have defeated have already been making a gradual comeback for a number of years now thanks to anti vaccination rhetoric spreading through toxic mommy communities.

2495,"I feel like after over a year of constant corona virus news, there shouldn‚Äôt be many left who don‚Äôt know that, whether they want to or not."
2496,"Guess that‚Äôs what happens when lots of people are more afraid of a vaccine than they are of a pandemic, and some people in power deliberately encourage those conspiracy theories as a cheap way to win publicity"
2497,Was coming here to say this.
2498,"People in Ontario, where I am, have been screeching for reopening phases to move faster."

2567,As far as I can tell in most of North Western Europe the vaccine is available to anyone who wants it.

2585,I fear that the life that I just got back thanks to the vaccination will soon be taken away all over again and I blame that on the fact that the unvaccinated ones are not making this ending of the pandemic any easier.
2586,THAT is what is causing me to lose faith lately.

Wouldn't an argument centered around the fact that she's a medical professional speaking about legal matters while in an official capacity concerning only medical matters put that wrongful termination case to rest?"

2640,It's pretty simple.
2641,"Vaccines prevent hospitalizations and death, if they got the vaccine they won't be there."
2642,The CDC data already showed that only 0.003% of vaccinated people ended up in the hospital.
2643,"People had enough time to get the vaccine if they wanted one, so if they end up in the hospital it's their own fault for choosing not to."
2644,What about the immunocompromised who have no protection from the vaccine and therefore rely on herd immunity to protect them?

2662,They do not deserve to be treated equally.

2684,Certain things being mandatory like this will get us back on track to progressing again
2685,"Covishield is still not accepted by EU (some countries are now accepting it, but not all)."

2687,"I tried to share about the millions vaccinated with it, but it doesn't work."
2688,"Especially that I had Pfizer in Canada, it harm my credibility..."
2689,"Yes , it‚Äôs very click bait and inaccurate title."
2690,"Also from the article :

Some studies have shown that those infected with Covid after vaccination produce much less virus than those who are unvaccinated, reducing the risk of passing the virus to others."

2698,What are the long term issues the young are going to have if youo keep them locked up for a decade while you decide what the long term effects of this are going to be?
2699,"We're already seeing kids at school who have problems socialising, have problems reading other people's faces (because masks hide whether someone is smiling or not)."
2700,People's education ruined.
2701,Kids ability to make new friends ruined.
2702,And they've only been locked up for 18 months.
2703,"You might think, well it's not important for children to make friends over the next decade, they can cope with being imprisoned at home alone while we work out what the long term effects of covid over a decade are."
2704,But it *does* matter.
2705,Imprisoning about 15 million kids because of a couple of anecdotal stories about long covid is grossly irresponsible.
2706,WHO has a much broader view.. in the sense that they have a vested interest in helping the world.
2707,"It would be preferable for countries to donate their supply of mismatched vaccine doses than administer them.. and tagt is also the rationale they explained for their statement a while back that anti vaxxers latched onto about not vaccinating children.. it‚Äôs not that it‚Äôs unsafe, it‚Äôs that there are countries suffering greatly still that can‚Äôt get vaccines at all."

2718,&gt; Why should they?
2719,"Canada won't use it because they find it's too risky compared to other vaccine, so let send it to the poor and keep the good one."
2720,What do they expect people at the other end will do?
2721,Take what they have?
2722,If you have a choice take the better one.
2723,"If you don't, don't."
2724,Canada used AZ when it had no choice too.
2725,If the nation you're in doesn't want to take it I hope it goes somewhere where it will be used instead.
2726,There are a lot of countries out there that would gladly take these vaccines.
2727,They're highly effective and the blood clot risks are well worth it considering how dangerous COVID is.
2728,Got-dang this youthful rebellion what with ours kids gettin‚Äô vaccinated ‚Äòn hwat-not!
2729,"I have recently received a lot more negative comments about still wearing a mask, it has become noticeable since it even comes from people who were very (or even overly) serious about not taking any risks."

2740,i.e.
2741,"you alluded to ""being healthy"" but what does that mean specifically with respect to covid?"
2742,"There have been a lot of ""healthy"" people who died"
2743,Maybe I'll ask a question I thought was dumb then too.
2744,"When I started hearing about the mutations being more transmissible, I thought: Could you release a manmade harmless version of the coronavirus that's even more transmissible that would outcompete the dangerous ones?"
2745,But then I had the same question as the OP .
2746,.
2747,.
2748,I didn't understand why only one could exist at a time.
2749,We need this in the US.
2750,There will always be breakthrough cases.
2751,That doesn‚Äôt mean the vaccine is ineffective
2752,I disagree.
2753,"How come then some people's immune system can fight it off easily (asymptomatic), some get mild symptoms, some get serious symptoms, and some die?"
2754,Obviously there's some factor in the equation that is in play.
2755,And I am asking what those factors are.
2756,"Without having good numbers on how many non-hospitalized vaccinated people will end up with longterm heart, lung, other damage from the Delta or other variant I don‚Äôt see the harm in being prepared for booster shots."
2757,My guesstimate is 3-5%.
2758,Very roughly as rare as hospitalizations plus deaths.
2759,Oh yea it would make sense that they would go up .
2760,I do think there was an article posted on this sun about Florida having the highest total amount of new cases as well.
2761,Okay
2762,Lots of Staten Island.
2763,I for one am shocked that those people wouldn't get the shot.
2764,Just shocked.
2765,Super awesome too as a lot of them come down to the shore on the weekends.

2774,Yeah that's exactly it.
2775,"We took out such a massive early lead by stopping Covid here really effectively (at massive cost to anyone that's either stuck in our outside Australia, but I definitely think it was the right call)."
2776,"And then our leaders broke their hands off patting themselves on the back, and here we are, drunk pantless with our dicks in our hands at the starting line, while the rest of the world is 3 laps ahead."
2777,"It's unfortunate that the media has managed to so successfully damage the reputation of this vaccine, because despite some rare blood clotting issues it's incredibly efficacious."
2778,I hope with time that the fears will subside; and that soon enough more countries will recognize all WHO-approved vaccines for border passage.

2812,"Photo: Galo Paguay / EL COMERCIO
Valeria Heredia (I)

Today begins phase three of the 9/100 Vaccination Plan , called No Contagion."
2813,Its objective is to inoculate people between 48 and 16 years old; more those who are in a situation of mobility.
2814,It will run until September 5.
2815,"The number of inhabitants in this age range is 8.5 million, according to the population projections of the National Institute of Statistics and Censuses ( INEC )."
2816,"This represents 68.7% of the 12.4 million, which are part of the target population identified by the Ministry of Public Health (MSP)."
2817,"The dynamics will be similar to the one that took place in previous weeks, that is, each day an age group will be served."
2818,"For example, today it is up to people who are 48 years old; tomorrow at 47; Wednesday, at 46, etc."
2819,"On weekends, latecomers may come, that is, those who did not make it on the assigned day."
2820,This will be done until the 26th of this month.
2821,"On that date, the modality will change again: two days for each age, said Jos√© Ruales , vice minister."
2822,The Portfolio has planned to open new vaccination points.
2823,"In Quito, after a unification, it went from 51 to 24 sites."
2824,"But, the week before, there were long lines at the campuses, including Bicentenario and Universidad Salesiana, in the north, and the Paulo VI and Consejo Provincial schools, in the south."
2825,"Therefore, the decision was to enable five more points, located in the universities : Cat√≥lica, De las Am√©ricas, UTE, San Francisco and Hemisferios."
2826,"La Cat√≥lica reopens today from 08:00 to 17:00, with 10 brigades."
2827,"Its capacity is 1,500 people per day."
2828,"""The processes will be simplified to speed up the inoculation,"" explained Silvana Ortiz , Dean of Nursing."
2829,"In the UDLA, on the other hand, they are already organizing to open the space to the public, from Monday to Friday."
2830,Currently it only works on weekends.
2831,"On Saturday and Sunday, for example, the immunization of the students was carried out."
2832,"The doses were scheduled to be applied to 16,000 young people from all majors, including graduate students."
2833,"It was done at the Granados campuses and at UDLA Park, confirmed Marlena Le√≥n, academic vice-rector."
2834,"""With these initiatives, the progressive return to face-to-face classes is expected."""
2835,The university also provides for the immunization of its former graduates.
2836,"There will be more than 50,000 citizens."
2837,"In the UTE, on the other hand, the students will begin to be vaccinated from Tuesday , in alphabetical order."
2838,While the USFQ is supported with the placement of doses to workers in the tourism sector.
2839,"To qualify more points, the MSP will have the support of the National Electoral Council ( CNE ) and the Red Cross."
2840,"Diana Atamaint , president of the CNE, recalled that they made the more than 4,000 electoral precincts available to become vaccination sites."
2841,‚ÄúEveryone is available.
2842,Now it depends on Health and its operational capacity: personnel and supplies ‚Äù.
2843,"In this sense, the Portfolio coordinated with the Quito Health Secretariat for the hiring of 40 vaccinators."
2844,They will go to the new sites.
2845,The Ministry of Health has also strengthened alliances with private companies.
2846,"Adelca, for example, enabled a vaccination center in its sports center, located in Al√≥ag, since June 7."
2847,"This week it will reach 5,000 people."
2848,The firms are also immunizing their workers.
2849,Grupo DK - which brings together shopping centers such as Quicentro and Granados Plaza - began with the administration of doses last Thursday.
2850,Megamaxi did the same.
2851,"For V√≠ctor √Ålvarez, president of the College of Physicians of Pichincha , vaccination had a wrong start, but now it is progressing at a better pace."
2852,‚ÄúThere is an adequate process and clear objectives.
2853,The organization still needs to be adjusted ‚Äù.
2854,"Therefore, it calls for greater openness to the unions."
2855,They can help with logistics and volunteers for immunization.
2856,"""Months ago we managed to inoculate 4,000 doctors."""
2857,Epidemiologist Daniel Simancas agrees with his peer.
2858,"To achieve the goal of vaccinating 9 million citizens it
is essential to have the doses of CanSino ."
2859,"It was announced that 700,000 will arrive until next August."
2860,The reason is that only one is required.
2861,"""This will reach the largest number of the population and face the arrival of strong variants, such as the Delta (identified in India)."
2862,No it's sadly not.
2863,I'm living it first hand in Africa (I'm Canadian) and people where I am do not want AZ.
2864,"They heard about other countries restricting its use, and now they'll send the stuff they don't want to use on their own population."
2865,Consequence is that everyone I spoke to here prefer no vaccine to AZ.
2866,"Especially that covid is basically seen as a thing affecting mostly weak foreigners (they had few deaths, barely existing health system was unaffected, morgue saw no noticeable increase, etc.)"
2867,So all those news and condescending donations will only help in making millions not wanting rich countries trash vaccine (how it is perceived here).
2868,Statistics on how safe it is won't change people mind.
2869,"Rich countries refusing to use it will have a much stronger impact, at least where I am."
2870,I dunno about that.
2871,They seem to have a lot of faith in religion.

2878,"Aye okay , i figured one of the days , primarily the Thursday was a weekly total , then they posted the next day."
2879,"Still considering Texas , California and New York cases it would still seem low if Florida‚Äôs new cases were lagging that far behind"
2880,"Vaccine is actually even a worse screening, as vaccinated can be positive and contagious and still attend events without any test."
2881,I would feel safer to let in a person with a negative test than a vaccinated.
2882,Most all states are seeing infection rates shooting through the roof.
2883,We collectively pulled the trigger on rolling back protective measures way too quickly.
2884,I anticipate a huge increase in cases through the summer in the US.
2885,It will be very interesting to see the data come out of though in relation to hospitalizations / deaths amongst vaccinated / unvaccinated.
2886,My empathy is gone and I am just seeing what unfolds from a data / social aspect.
2887,"Probably will garner a lot of hate for saying that, but my time of caring / hoping for our society to pull through is done."
2888,"Personally I agree with you, especially with the understanding that Canada had no production capacity of any kind, and will continue not to have any for a couple more months."
2889,Being able to donate doses that were only purchased but otherwise manufactured by and in other countries makes the act a little more meaningful.
2890,The airplanes I fly on do not have HEPA filters.
2891,That‚Äôs reserved for the big ones.
2892,Makes sense since 50%+ of unvaccinated people were also asymptomatic.
2893,"The situation, while real, is vastly overblown."
2894,Letting the virus spread unchecked when children and young adults are not vaccinated is irresponsible due to the long term unknown possible health complications.
2895,"Not just the risk of long term Covid, but also possible heart, lung, kidney and brain damage."
2896,Some people who had no to mild Covid symptoms have turned up with damaged organs from the disease.
2897,What are the long term issues the young are going to have all because Boris did not want to wait for everyone to get the chance to be vaccinated?
2898,Those are different vaccines.
2899,TDAP (the booster we all should get every 10 years) is preventative but the one you get at the ER after suspected exposure is more of an antitoxin to prevent it from taking hold in your body.
2900,Ideally you'd be up-to-date on your usual tetanus vaccine and the latter would just be a formality/double insurance that you won't get sick from tetanus.
2901,https://accessmedicine.mhmedical.com/content.aspx?bookid=391&amp;sectionid=42070048
2902,The WHO and CDC are far too risk adverse.
2903,They would rather let thousands die due to COVID19 rather than one die due to a bad vaccine reaction.
2904,"Their definition of ""do no harm"" is stuck in the pre-pandemic times."
2905,[deleted]
2906,Beautiful writeup!
2907,"It's crazy how fast we're moving, and it really begs the question as to how quickly we could have been at 75% double dosed if we had better access to vaccines in January/February."
2908,Imagine what winter would have looked like with a democrat in the White House who was willing to work with us.
2909,"Or, at least a president with a functioning brain."
2910,"Regardless, we made up for lost time in a hurry."
2911,I'm glad so many mixed and matched.
2912,Flexibility and speed.
2913,The issue is the delta variant is quick as well.
2914,So think of it as a new lockdown but with vaccinated people allowed to be out.
2915,"Hospitalizations are tiny as hell.... sure cases are up, but due to vaccines it isn't as bad as before."
2916,Says WHO?
2917,I‚Äôm hoping most people understand by now the mutation is causing uncertainty in the vaccine.
2918,Another excuses?ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è all vaccines have rare bad side effects.
2919,Are you really commenting on every post with anti-mask rhetoric?
2920,"I don't necessarily see the Northeastern states like NJ, NY, or Connecticut experiencing the same fate, though."
2921,"The exact same lag will happen, but the bump will be less severe."
2922,"There's still an obvious predictable correlation between cases, hospitalizations and deaths, it's just not the same ratios."
2923,Some asymptomatic people had heart damage when examined later.
2924,"I hope that's not the case here, because to me that is quite a symptom."
2925,"Would love to see a booster (if needed, of course) for elderly and immunocompromised."
2926,"My dad's a blood cancer patient, and there've been some studies indicating smaller antibody response among similar patients to just 2 vaccines."
2927,Would be a nice safety net for a lot of people who might otherwise be susceptible again.
2928,"Let's see the early data, but I'm glad Pfizer is thinking ahead at least since the CDC has tended to not do that very well so far this pandemic."
2929,"If you're in the US, the vaccine is FREE and widely available."
2930,"So no one has ""missed out"" I'm not against more data but there's a lot out there and none of it looks promising."
2931,Yes.
2932,Getting tested now üò¢
2933,Excuse my ignorance but what am I missing here?
2934,"&gt;We're seeing in Israel that fully vaccinated people are often falling sick due to unvaccinated people, and there is still the risk of death."
2935,Shouldn't it be the other way around?
2936,So the vaccine isn't fulfilling its only duty?
2937,&gt;tons of unvaccinated peers means there's no herd immunity and they can still spread the virus.
2938,"I thought people who had the vaccine can also, still catch and spread covid but with suppressed symptoms, again making the unvaccinated people the ones who'd be at a loss in that situation too."
2939,Why is this whole situation so ambiguous?
2940,Yup.
2941,You must not have ever seen a parent's stupidity kill their child before.
2942,Must be nice.
2943,Ah global health systems.
2944,You privileged westerners.
2945,The vast majority of the cases are among the unvaccinated.
2946,Nothing about the vaccination rate will prevent those cases from progressing to hospitalizations and then to fatalities
2947,They just can't catch a break.

2984,Some of the best studies come from Singaporean contact tracers.
2985,"Singapore has high vaccination rates with mRNA and they‚Äôre still seeing tons of asymptomatic spread even via fully-vaccinated individuals:¬†¬†¬†https://twitter.com/michaelzlin/status/1409707511519748102?s=21

We aren't tracing/tracking those infections in the US so we truly don't know how much of our spread is via vaccinated individuals."
2986,"The CDC says not to test a vaccinated¬†individual¬†unless they are symptomatic, which means we are likely missing a lot of cases."
2987,"Yes, antibodies are just one part of the immune response."
2988,"This is a good summary:

3026,"Last year when the Pfizer/Moderna shots were getting approved, I thought yeah those are nice, but the J&amp;J vaccine would be the true game changer for a variety of reasons (1 dose, traditional vaccine type, household brand name, etc.)."
3027,That could not have been farther from the case.
3028,"If you want to keep wearing your mask fine, but for those of us who are vaccinated and choose not to, please realize you are not superior just because you choose to keep yours on."
3029,"The issue on Reddit is not that people give you a hard time for wearing masks, it‚Äôs that people gaslight those who have gotten vaccinated and who have been careful but have chosen to stop wearing masks now because they feel it‚Äôs safe to dispose of them now that they‚Äôre vaxxed"
3030,I think it's about vaccine incentivisation as well because high levels of vaccination are still more effective against covid than travel restrictions.
3031,"Like if you take the fire analogy you hear sometimes: Unvaccinated people are like dry wood, vaccinated people are like wet wood, travel restrictions are walls and doors."
3032,We only have supportive therapy so there's no firehose.
3033,"So the heavy travel restriction approach is great when there's no covid in the country, like in Australia until recently."
3034,"However, once its in the room like a piece of dry wood on fire, those walls and doors aren't as helpful as they were before."
3035,"Social distancing is good for a while but people can't sit still nafurally, entropy always wins so that's a  temporary solution 

Therefor you gotta vaccinate the people and wet the metaphorical wood pieces."
3036,"However, letting vaccinated people travel is good for this reason."
3037,Bringing in more wet wood can tip the population towards a vaccinated majority (this is a fairly small number if you try and compare them to countries but it would make a difference in popular cities where vaccinated immigrants would favour).
3038,The key here is high vaccine proportion for heard immunity.
3039,"Very broadly speaking, a higher vax/non-vax ratio + more people is still safer than a lower ratio and less people."
3040,It also means the population gets less sick from said disease as vaccinated people aren't likely to be taking up ventilator beds/resources.
3041,Higher rates of vaccination means being able to tolerate higher covid numbers.
3042,"Look at Ireland for example, it's hospitalisation numbers are way lower proportionately to when the numbers were the same last year."
3043,"The scary thing is that if there's a big non-vax cohort, they are basically covids playground."
3044,The interplay between vax and non vax people with covid is what leads to more variants that could eventually overpower the current vaccines.
3045,"So the goal is to raise the vax proportion not just as high as possible, but to do it faster than covid can evolve."
3046,It's bleak and all this media distraction and propaganda just slows things down.

3065,"Not, these numbers cannot be interpreted in the context of any single individuals."
3066,"If you go French-kiss a Covid-19 carrier, no one can give you a % of the chance of developing symptomatic carrier."
3067,"But if a very large number of vaccinated individuals were to do the above, the number of symptomatic carriers would be 5% of the number compared to an identical cohort of unvaccinated individuals."
3068,"(But the efficacy wouldn't be 95%, the 5% number wouldn't hold."
3069,"Efficacy is stated in terms of disease-environment of the trial, which is one reason why the Pfizer/Moderna numbers aren't comparable to AZ/Chinese ones despite real world evidence showing that these vaccines work just about the same)."

3222,"Taiwan had tried for months to get the vaccine from the German company, until on Sunday BioNTech's Chinese sales agent, which also has the right to sell the shot to the island, said it would sell 10 million doses to two Taiwanese tech giants, after Taiwan's government said they could negotiate on their behalf."

We have, the problem is the other side of the argument argues in bad faith and constantly shifts the goalposts as more and more info becomes available, as we see how incredibly safe the vaccines are, what a dramatic effect they have on case numbers, and how they reduce severity of symptoms for the few cases that do slip through."
3363,"At this point most of the anti-vaxxers are saying ""I don't have to get it bc herd immunity"" (which doesn't exist anymore, COVID is too aggressive and is projected to infect all unvaccinated people within a year with the Delta variant assuming no others show up) or ""we don't know the long term effects that will show up in 5 years!!!"""

3449,Ah ok. That's kind of a different story because the vast majority of breakthrough cases are in the elderly who have a poor immune response even when vaccinated.
3450,Just because some kids won‚Äôt die doesn‚Äôt mean that others wouldn‚Äôt.
3451,Plus not everyone is physically able to get vaccinated so letting the virus spread freely through schools will just prolong this for everybody.

3482,Removal of the mask mandates should have been based on exactly that.

3574,[removed]
3575,It's hard to get reliable data on that.
3576,Especially since a lot of those cases will go undetected.
3577,"For example the CDC does not encourage fully vaccinated people get tested for COVID-19, which does make sense from a resource management standpoint."
3578,Endless testing gets expensive.
3579,The real question is whether or not we'll see a corresponding surge in hospitalizations/deaths.
3580,If not we'll have to thank our lucky stars for the vaccines.
3581,Oops
3582,"Also

&gt;‚ÄúThe source of the outbreak was an off-site private party on June 7 and all who tested positive are doing well and have returned to work,‚Äù"
3583,"I don't know, can you we?"
3584,Which is why once flu season comes around there could be a problem.
3585,Not saying it will be but we're kinda behind on people catching normal respiratory illnesses right now due to all the safety measures.
3586,"Humm, I cant imagine why Taiwan would not trust a Chinese company to properly deliver the vaccines."
3587,Especially since China forced the WHO to exclude Taiwan.

3614,Only 80% of Californians over 50 have a first dose (3X fewer people vaccinated than the UK) and only 70% have been fully vaccinated (4X fewer people vaccinated than the UK).
3615,A single dose is not very effective against Delta for symptoms and provides moderate (but not great) protection against severe COVID.
3616,So the difference between California and the UK is pretty significant.
3617,"That said, 80% at least partially protected and 70% well protected is still a *LOT* better than things before vaccines."
3618,California is - as a whole - relatively well off against COVID.

3632,It is really interesting how different things are in other parts of the world!
3633,I'll keep getting mine every 10 years though.
3634,So let me get this straight.
3635,The state of California is forcing children to keep wearing masks even though any adult that wants the vaccine has had months to get it and children are more likely to have complications from the flu than covid?
3636,I can see why people are fleeing such an incompetent state...

3652,i actually know a couple of friends and their friends (total of 9 people) who were fully vaccinated with pfizer and moderna that got infected with Delta after a big dinner.
3653,it's a fact that vaccine's efficacy diminishes vs delta.

3679,Not really sure about the relevance of your question.
3680,Extended intervals beyond four weeks between prime and boost have been pretty much standard in Canada for most of the population.
3681,I was about 8 weeks between doses (Pfizer) and side effects were similar for both doses.

3683,Father of a kid who just completed first grade with ADHD and Autism and an uncle to a kid who just did kindergarten‚Ä¶ they all wore their masks no problem.
3684,Largely in part because mask wearing has been modeled by their parents and the community.
3685,I‚Äôm fortunately in an area of California where people have been really great about masking.
3686,Kids at 4 and 5 will do what they‚Äôve been shown to do.
3687,For schools?
3688,Absolutely.
3689,As soon as a vaccine is given full authorization and approval for school age kids public schools will start mandating it.
3690,Hopefully they get rid of religious exemptions too.
3691,"im not anti-mask, just question the purpose of vaccinated individuals wearing a mask."

Open up everything."

3735,"Get this county 100% back to pre-pandemic normal operating under the following parameters:  
\- If you choose not to vaccinate and you contract covid and have severe symptoms you should be denied access to hospitals/health care and fend for yourself."

3737,\- If you receive the vaccine and end up testing positive and have symptoms you will receive healthcare and be treated as usual.

3765,I don‚Äôt see how requiring covid vaccination is different.
3766,I think that most people have never encountered a required vaccination and now think it‚Äôs overstepping.. which IMO it‚Äôs absolutely within reason to require.
3767,Many hospitals require flu vaccines unless you need to mask.
3768,And you have a sticker on your badge proving your vaccination status so it‚Äôs easy to tell who needs to wear a mask.

3872,My old French friends signed up on waitlists to get it this spring.
3873,Several younger friends had Covid last fall and it wasn't fun.
3874,They eagerly awaited their chance at the vaccine which came later for them.
3875,"Also, when one of them hurt his knee (arguably not his back), he got an MRI."

3877,"What I saw here in my country(Syria) is that there was vaccine hesitancy  at first, when people saw their relatives getting it without anything happening to then, more people opened up to the idea."
3878,"Unfortunately, when more people wanted it, Syria ran out of vaccines, and we are waiting for a new shipment from COVAX"

3883,I have no further questions.
3884,I take your response as genuine and legitimate.
3885,Have a good night and please tell others to get vaccinated.
3886,I‚Äôm terrified for my baby.
3887,I‚Äôm terrified that I‚Äôm going to get it and not be able to breastfeed her (I‚Äôve heard COVID can make you lose your supply).
3888,"I‚Äôm vaccinated, but what if?"
3889,I wish people around me took it more seriously.

3908,"there is no such thing as being ""too safe"" specially against a deadly virus"
3909,Tests will not be free after august in France.
3910,This is true.
3911,I live in SW MO and life has gone back to normal.
3912,I don't think that's what they are saying.
3913,People that want to work from home should be able to do so permanently for example.
3914,That's a change that will help and increase people's freedom.
3915,Honestly in places where covid is running rampant AZ is much much safer than risking covid.
3916,The reason they stopped giving them was because cases were going down significantly here and they had to weigh the risk but even then it was lower than covid.
3917,I took AZ.. when we needed to we all did in my age group.
3918,And I assume it will be that way for other countries if they need to they have that option
3919,It‚Äôs fear.
3920,They‚Äôre anxious about the vaccine doing harm.
3921,They‚Äôre not necessarily anti-vaxxers but they‚Äôre also nervous about it.
3922,As a Tennessean: *Are you fucking kidding me?!
3923,*
3924,It‚Äôs reasonable to assume that s/he might be dead?
3925,"You know nothing about this person‚Äôs age or health, but you think it‚Äôs reasonable to assume death would have been the outcome had s/he not been vaccinated?"
3926,What is wrong you with people?
3927,It‚Äôs like you sincerely wish and hope that covid is deadlier than it actually is.
3928,"sure, the risk assessment of whether it is worth having kids in school is always left up to the individual parent to decide."
3929,"I'm just saying that if it is unavoidable for one's children to come into contact with others, it is still better to have the children wear masks."
3930,"Wait, isn‚Äôt that exactly what will happen?"
3931,I thought the vaccines were more effective vs hospitalization and death than vs infection?
3932,"this is scary, so we are not free men anymore, our body is owned by the state and our freedoms will be removed in the future if we do not want to inject something on our body."
3933,"That is very scary, so many wars and suffering to be truly free and we give it away just like this, and clap and support it as well...

Disclaimer: vaccinated, but this is madness and so unfair,  and in france.. where equality is one of their 3 main principles of their democracy."
3934,Ok
3935,Because we're still in the middle of our vaccination program.
3936,"US and UK bought up most of the early vaccines, Europe is having to play catch up."
3937,We basically use every vaccine in stock almost as soon as it is available.
3938,"The Flemish side of Belgium is well on the way to have +80% full vaccination rate for adults (right now at 87% of first shots)

These kids are minors, and only now are starting to get their invitations for the first shot."

3944,"If the supply can keep up with the demand, sure."
3945,[removed]
3946,Yeah bud i didn't say it was 100%.
3947,"FDA is going to list rare nerve syndrome to Johnson &amp; Johnson Vaccine, and there are heart inflammation-related warnings to mRNA vaccines."
3948,Doesn't such warnings in vaccines imply that a person should know about the possible rare side effects and choose for himself/herself whether he/she wants to take the vaccine or not?
3949,Can having such listed warnings go side by side with mandatory vaccinations by law?
3950,"Vaccination is becoming mandatory, not explicitly, but implicitly like you need to take the vaccine to travel, need to take the vaccine to come to the office, etc."
3951,Doesn't that imply disregard for the given warnings?
3952,I got AstraZeneca on the first shot and Biontech/Pfizer on the second.
3953,Its recommended now in Germany for those who had AZ on the first because immunologic data showed much higher antibody titer with this mix.
3954,Its also slightly better than 2x Biontech/Pfizer.

Scotland has shown 79% against infection -¬†https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)01358-1/fulltext

Singapore shows 69% against infection."
3990,"So we land somewhere between 64% and 88%, likely somewhere in the middle."
3991,Some of the best studies come from Singaporean contact tracers.
3992,"Singapore has high vaccination rates with mRNA and they‚Äôre still seeing tons of asymptomatic spread even via fully-vaccinated individuals:¬†¬†¬†https://twitter.com/michaelzlin/status/1409707511519748102?s=21

We aren't tracing/tracking those infections in the US so we truly don't know how much of our spread is via vaccinated individuals."
3993,"The CDC says not to test a vaccinated¬†individual¬†unless they are symptomatic, which means we are likely missing a lot of cases."
3994,"&gt; Out of 10 areas citywide with the lowest vaccination rates, six of them also have the highest positivity rates, according to the city's health department."
3995,"Let‚Äôs stop calling them conservative, and call it what it is."
3996,Uneducated.
3997,I could see a decent amount of people going back to indoor masks but I doubt they‚Äôll be a spike big enough where it‚Äôs as bad as October-December 2020.
3998,Canada's pants?
3999,I was thinking of South Africa or Kenya.
4000,Don't care much for Israel or Palestine.
4001,Every other country is keeping the masks.
4002,Epidemiologists suggest we should all still be masking indoors regardless of vax status.
4003,Dropping the mask mandate was a bold and reckless (and ineffective) move by the CDC to try to boost vaccinations and it's going to really put us all in a tough spot now with Delta.

&gt;‚ÄúWhether the co-infection of the two variants of concern played a role in the fast deterioration of the patient is difficult to say,‚Äù Vankeerberghen added."
4006,"‚ÄúUp to now, there have been no other published cases."
4007,"However, the global occurrence of this phenomenon is probably underestimated due to limited testing for variants of concern and the lack of a simple way to identify co-infections with whole genome sequencing.‚Äù

Sample size is small, and patient was old."
4008,"In the absence of additional data, I think it's safe to assume it's more dangerous."
4009,Is there any information currently about shoes bringing covid into your house on the floors?
4010,I have minor OCD and people in my house are very stubborn about taking off their shoes.
4011,I don't make a big deal out of it but it's sitting in the back of my head.
4012,Haven't had a chance to get vaccinated yet because I don't have a way of getting there yet.

4014,We‚Äôll always be #1 in idiots per capita!
4015,How many antivaxxers are in France?
4016,Will they get vaccinated now or just never go anywhere other than to work?
4017,The latter would be bad for the economy.
4018,My argument is you don‚Äôt go ahead and conduct experiments on your people.. you start experimenting on a small bunch and then wait for data to emerge.
4019,The same process you use to approve a vaccine
4020,[removed]
4021,So they should keep wearing masks.
4022,"If you are the parent of a young child, wear a mask."
4023,Not necessarily.
4024,There is a second dimension of variability among vaccines: the use of prefusion-stablized spike proteins.
4025,"Prefusion stablization locks the spike protein into the ""prefusion"" configuration: the shape it takes before binding to a host cell."
4026,This is the shape you want your immune system to recognize - it's the shape that spike protein on a real virus will take.
4027,"Some, but not all, COVID vaccines make use of prefusion stablization - it's a new technique so not all vaccine developers decided to use it."
4028,"J&amp;J, Pfizer and Moderna made use of it."
4029,"AZ did not, I believe Sputnik did not, and I'm not sure about other vaccines."
4030,"There seems to be a substantial gap between the efficacy of AZ and J&amp;J when it comes to the Beta (formerly B.1.351 or ""South Africa"") variant - J&amp;J's phase 3 trial indicated strong (\~66%) efficacy, whereas a small trial indicated AZ had little to no efficacy against the Beta variant."
4031,"&amp;#x200B;

However, there's a study which shows neutralizing antibody activity from AZ is strong vs the Delta variant, whereas it's quite weak against the Beta variant."

4033,All children under 12.
4034,Yea it really sucks.
4035,"It would be nice if people in my state practiced any form of personal responsibility, but unfortunately, the majority of people where I live haven‚Äôt since day one, and are incapable of governing themselves."
4036,Isn't France's vaccination rate at 40% right now?
4037,Doesn't that make August a bit... very quick?
4038,"I got my first shot in December 2020, caught covid and was sick throughout January 2021, recovered, and got my second shot in February 2021."

4042,English football fans are well known in Europe for their atrocious behavior.
4043,"They're not made fun for being the tamest, they're criticised for having some of the most unruly fans."

4049,&gt;It got out of control yesterday but that's largely been the exception rather than the norm.
4050,That's actually a very dangerous exception and it should never have happened.
4051,"You've got a stadium full of 60k people, what if one of those people who got through had a bomb?"
4052,It has very serious safety ramifications and shows how easy it could be for very dangerous people to get through the security should they want to do real harm.
4053,Wouldn't you need around 60% of potential travelers to be infected for this to be explained by just a 30% false negative rate?
4054,60 of 100 travelers are infected.
4055,18 of those get a false negative at 30%.
4056,That means 18 out of 58 travelers who actually get through are infected.
4057,‚ÄúNo brain‚Äù is a nice pun here.
4058,a single Pfizer dose is only 30% effective vs delta (current dominant strain in NL)
4059,The main concern with recombination is mixing of genetic data from different lineages.
4060,"In your example, it's a virus mixing with its immediate parent - that's not going to yield a dramatically new virus."
4061,"Yes, that rhetoric about ""moving the goalposts"" makes no sense."
4062,"It would be foolish to insist on a completely consistent, unchanging strategy in the face of high uncertainty and rapid changes in the threat level."
4063,&gt; So you are saying that it's better to let people die rather just buy the vaccine?
4064,"No, I am saying that the end customer would have to make sure the product is safe enough."
4065,These countries (A) all use a delayed booster regimen that increases antibodies and (B) have populations just recently vaccinated (no time for waning).
4066,Allow teens to decide for themselves if they want to get vaccinated.
4067,Same shit in my country... Groups coming back from Spain testing positive a few days later.
4068,Is there any source data for this?
4069,I've heard Scott Gottleib say it but I haven't see any published data.
4070,Or to show vaccinated people that we need to mask up.

4083,Wtf
4084,"I'd be more worried about the *single* people without a second dose, since they're the most likely to be coming into *very* close contact with others :^)"
4085,"City should be breaking this data down into vaccinated, partial, and not vaccinated groups to encourage everyone to get the damned shot."
4086,There are very few people who can't get vaccinated.
4087,But there are a lot of people for whom they are not as effective.
4088,"Yeah, I wouldn‚Äôt want to get in a car accident and have to go to one of these hospitals"
4089,look up the 1976 swine flu.
4090,You'll understand why there is skepticism.
4091,"I'm not saying the skepticism is correct, but our governments abuse of trust in the past is to blame for peoples skepticism."
4092,How would you go about doing that?
4093,Do you think the resources to pull a project of that magnitude off exist in most countries?
4094,"Even if there was a way in which the world could devote a year of everyone's life and immeasurable resources towards eradicating Covid, it would unlikely be worth it (not to mention it would likely just spread from animals again)."
4095,"It has been done once in history, and that took decades of globally coordinated efforts, and it was for a disease that was far, far deadlier than Covid."
4096,"Immunocompromised individuals are a small minority and for the majority, these vaccines are the silver bullet against covid."
4097,Why is Pfizer worrying about a booster when a lot of the developing world doesn‚Äôt have a vaccine?
4098,Go team indeed!
4099,Canada is well on its way to winning the gold medal for vaccinating its population the most successfully.
4100,"&gt; **Global Vaccine Comparison:** doses administered per 100 people (% with at least 1 dose), to date (**total progress so far**):

Looking at the leader board, Israel has a population of about 9 million, Mongolia about 3 million."
4101,"Canada about 38 million, and the UK about 68 million."
4102,"So in other words, the UK is the only country ahead of us without a really small population."
4103,"But including all three countries ahead of us, our current vaccination pace is far higher than all three."
4104,"It's roughly four times higher than that of the 2nd and 3rd place countries, and almost ten times higher than the leader Israel:

4108,"Sure, I'd agree with that."

4111,"Here in Norway you either get Pfizer or Moderna for both shots, no mixing."
4112,"The only people who got mixed vaccines are the ones who got AZ back in january/februar, and couldnt get a second dose of that one because of the blood clot issue."

4119,We are still in a much better spot than last year when we had way more restrictions.
4120,~70% anti-vax sentiment absolutely baffles me.
4121,a teacher in my country got the johnson vaccine 30 days ago.She tested positive and infected a few other teachers and  10 or more [children.You](https://children.You) sure about that?
4122,"There also was a 30 yo man that got both the mrna shots and still got covid, headache,sore throat, bone pain."
4123,Do not make conclusions because we can't be sure about these vaccines.Perhaps they reduce transmission by a little.

4125,"While it's not 100% there's still a strong correlation between intelligence and education and with that, income."
4126,"Sorry, no."
4127,"The correlation between intelligence and education, as touted by many people, is only an artifact of how IQ is measured."
4128,"All these IQ tests are designed to measure things that are generally taught in school, which people in the past mistook as intelligence."
4129,"There exist IQ tests that try to be more general and education independent, but these are hard to design and thus expensive to buy."
4130,"So, very few people use them and definitely not any of these IQ test websites."
4131,"Also, in a lot of European countries, family income and education is only weakly correlated."
4132,Thanks to school being free or nearly free for all.
4133,"Regardless, this does not help in any way those that are vaccine hesitant."

4143,The CDC website says that very very few people can't actually get vaccinated.
4144,It also says that most people with underlying conditions can get the vaccine.
4145,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/underlying-conditions.html
4146,I'll try to explain.
4147,"The required antibody test tests for IgM as opposed to the ""usual"" antibody test that targets IgG."
4148,IgM is produced in the early stage of infection and goes down as your body produces IgG to neutralize the virus.
4149,A positive IgM indicates there's a chance of active infection in early stage.
4150,I think this is an additional layer of security trying to filter out asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic cases in case the viral load is too low for the PCR test to detect.
4151,"Things changed again after vaccines rolled out, since a vaccinated traveler may now report positive S protein IgM despite not being infected (especially if they are vaccinated close to departure)."
4152,This is where the N protein IgM test came in.
4153,The mRNA and virus vector vaccines only carries information for body to produce S protein and corresponding antibodies.
4154,"Therefore, a positive N protein IgM will indicate the person have came into contact with the virus recently."
4155,"On the other hand, negative N protein IgM indicates the positive S protein IgM is likely the result of vaccine instead of the virus itself."
4156,"Also, yes, those got the inactivated virus vaccine can board the flight as long as they can provide the negative PCR test plus proof of vaccination."
4157,Hope this clarify things up for you a bit.
4158,P.S.
4159,": No it's not for the ""destination within destination""."
4160,We need all those test results to be able to board the plane.
4161,"There are separate tests to be done upon arrival, but they are something else."

4167,It might be just antigen vs Pcr.
4168,Also its about the incubation time.
4169,As someone that lives in France this is great news imho.
4170,France has a pretty big antivax problem.
4171,"My wife and I are fully vaccinated but we only know two other adults here that are also, friends of ours that are doctors so have been vaccinated for a while now."
4172,I have had a number of conversations with other parents at our sons school during pick up and so many of them are *really* against getting the vaccine.
4173,As are my parents-in-law (also in France) which blows my mind as my wife's mum is in her 70s and her dad is in his 80s and have basically lived inside their home for the past 16 months not doing anything.
4174,I am glad Macron has been clear on this.
4175,We need it.
4176,Although I know how a lot of people are going to react and it isn't going to be pretty.
4177,I doubt Calgary will see a serious short term spike.
4178,"Not only will vaccinations prevent super spreading, but we‚Äôre in the low season."
4179,Colder weather and schools coming back is the real test
4180,Not sure I understand either.
4181,Spike will be positive for a very long time if you are vaccinated.
4182,"Nucleocapsid proteins only show up 2 weeks after an infection and last for several months, it is not a sign of active infection."
4183,"It doesn't make sense for either positive results to be disqualifying for travel... Actually having both be positive would mean you were vaccinated and had a past infection, essentially the highest COVID immunity you can get."
4184,You might want to double check the requirements you are worried about.
4185,"She's warning about the *policy*, not the science."
4186,Are you from the Netherlands by any chance?
4187,I believe this is what they tried to do (I am Dutch but currently not living there) but it failed because people started using qr codes from other people they knew so they didn't have to get tested and has now resulted in enormous spikes in cases the last few days.
4188,Can you link me these studies?
4189,did you just cite the NYT as your source.
4190,Have they ever been correct?
4191,lol

4193,[removed]
4194,The UK today currently is at #2 for cases (34000) but # 57 (6 deaths) in terms of deaths.
4195,That's due to UK having insane testing as well as the extremely high vaccination levels among the vulnerable ~ 95%.
4196,Cases should peak in 2 weeks now that the Euros are over and schools will close.
4197,The lifting of remaining restrictions mostly nightclubs will not make much impact given that there was no social distancing during the Euros.
4198,"I know we get a lot of self-indulgent trolls these days, based on recent post history I'm willing to believe this was an honest question."

4204,I thought it was my diet and lack of exercise.
4205,"38.8 is fully vaccinated, 26.9% have hade one shot."
4206,64.7% in total.
4207,As I understand it it mostly spreads in the young unvaccinated group.
4208,My understanding is it's not advised to mix manufactures.
4209,Well the easiest explanation would be that there is an NDP in power there.
4210,It really depends on when those countries were able to get access to vaccines though.
4211,For example here in Canada we passed the US a while ago in % with first doses and we are going to pass their % with second doses this week.
4212,If you look at our stats in isolation they are fairly similar.
4213,But the difference is that in Canada we have just really started to roll out 2nd doses big time in the last two weeks (2nd appointments are now open to book for anyone 18+).
4214,"The US on the other hand has had vaccines available easily for months now, and much of the populace simply refuses to get vaccinated."
4215,"So the question is, what has France's rollout been like timeline wise, and how does that compare to other EU countries?"
4216,It isn't part of the EU now but the UK obviously was much faster.

4261,"If we could get 70 percent vaccinated, it would cut deaths and hospitalizations quite a bit."
4262,"That's going to be even more important this year if we don't have covid restrictions, so we can avoid simultaneous flu and covid outbreaks."

4342,No observation of National Immunization Awareness Month in August.
4343,No reminders to the parents of teens who are late in receiving their second COVID-19 vaccine.
4344,THIS is a failure of public health to protect the people of Tennessee and THAT is what is ‚Äúreprehensible‚Äù.
4345,"When the people elected and appointed to lead this state put their political gains ahead of the public good, they have betrayed the people who have trusted them with their lives."
4346,To be fair that decision was only taken here also like a good month ago when it was clear we had sufficient vaccines anyway.
4347,But yeah Belgians were very cynical about the slow start of our vaccination progress in the beginning but since like April or late March we‚Äôre averaging 600-700k shots a week (first or second) on a population of 11 million so we‚Äôre targeting a very high vaccination level coming end of the summer.

4443,"Edit: come to think of it, that second part is probably why you don‚Äôt have any data to look at."
4444,Still probably lose you sense of taste or smell for a month though.
4445,L0l
4446,They‚Äôre saying between 6 and 12 months.
4447,Israel is the one panicking and starting them right now.
4448,Scott Gottlieb is saying (my paraphrasing) ‚Äúwe (at Pfizer) think some people (mostly older people) in the US may benefit from them going into the fall.
4449,"For that to happen, we need to do the studies and submit the info to fda now, so it can be ready to go in the fall if it‚Äôs determined it‚Äôs needed/beneficial.‚Äù"
4450,Unless you have unvaxed kids at home being asymptomatic is not really a big deal.
4451,I‚Äôd check that again.
4452,"0.1% is the hospitalisation rate for the vaccinated, not the infection rate."
4453,This isn't great to hear as someone with a chronic condition and a suppressed immune system who has to visit hospitals fairly often.
4454,"I like to echo the sentiment that mask mandates were lifted too early in essential places where the vulnerable have to go, like grocery stores."
4455,Is there evidence that other coronaviruses cause long-term problems despite causing only mild symptoms?
4456,A friend who had been on cancer drugs has this problem.
4457,She had the vaccine but had no reaction at all.
4458,Her doctor thinks she may have some immunity but not full.
4459,She is worried.
4460,"Yea no, I'm vaccinated I'm not going back to wearing one."
4461,"It's just those 50% unvaccinated, rest of us already made the choice."
4462,[deleted]
4463,And unvaccinated.
4464,Ok.
4465,Anyway.
4466,So like I was saying.
4467,Rest In Peace to free speech and open debate onlineü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
4468,"I agree, but does your work have pto from vaccine side effects?"
4469,I got sick AF first go around missed a week of work.
4470,I don't think jobs will keep handing pto to people getting sick from shots every 6 months.
4471,I think it‚Äôs time to seriously consider the vaccine passports
4472,Oof.
4473,Why aren't yall vaccinated already?
4474,This post appears to be about vaccines.

4479,We should not have stopped so early.
4480,It did not work as an incentive to vaccinate.
4481,They need to start doing this in the US
4482,Pretty sure second doses will be administered more quickly.
4483,The original long delay was to stretch the vaccine supply - now the numbers of daily jabs are falling the logic for a long gap is (mostly) gone.
4484,My 21 year old nephew is due his second jab this week.

4487,Are we really still doing this flu shit?
4488,"When we wear masks during flu season, there is no flu season."
4489,"When over half of us are immune to the delta variant of coronavirus, it can still spread exponentially."
4490,There's a massive difference.
4491,We are at the lowest number of deaths on average since this thing started... and that number is still competitive with flu.
4492,"I get it, you want this to be all over."
4493,I do too.
4494,We are nowhere near the conditions for that to be the case.
4495,"You can say ""it's over for me"" but it's an absurd claim."
4496,There have been studies with just such a comparison.
4497,Not sure if this particular one has hit publication yet but it should have done.
4498,One stand out was that hospitalisation rate (i.e.
4499,a very severe or life- threatening situation) was 1 in 60 for unvaccinated people and for the vaccinated it‚Äôs 1 in 1000.
4500,So in both cases the ‚Äúmajority‚Äù could be framed as non-severe.

4509,My state is funding a program but each school has to opt in and then parents have to opt in for their kid to be included.
4510,My guess is that the parents who choose not to opt in are the same ones taking zero precautions because they don‚Äôt take the pandemic seriously.
4511,"So it might catch spread among other kids, but won‚Äôt identify the Typhoid Marys who bring it to campus in the first place."
4512,Awful.
4513,People need to stop treating children as property.
4514,"Just tested positive, have a small cough and a very mild headache."
4515,"Anyone who has had it, can you give me advice."
4516,My stoic mask is slipping and I'm pretty scared now.
4517,How is the WiFi?
4518,Not the case in France.
4519,iirc the government said it will hold any responsibilities in case of side effects.
4520,nice to see online crazy have consequences.
4521,"where was it that they rounded up people refusing to mask or stay home during lockdown, and put them in vans with actors pretending to have to covid to scare them straight?"
4522,india?
4523,It'll help vaccination rates too due to ease and availability
4524,Thanks you.
4525,I just recalled this message to my friends
4526,It's only a problem if they meet someone else who has been infected.
4527,That probability is somewhat less unless they go to somewhere with large crowds.
4528,I got vaccinated March 29 and have been sick for 4 days.
4529,Find out test results tomorrow.
4530,Did pcr test to see if it's delta
4531,"I had taken mixed dose, AZ then mRNA based vaccine was a bit skeptical about it."
4532,"But now that WHO warns against doing it, I feel more confident that I DID THE RIGHT THING."
4533,It shouldn't be mandatory.
4534,Everyone who wants to be protected can get vaccinated so there is no reason for it to be mandatory.
4535,Then health authorities need to make clear what is the public health goal they want to achieve.
4536,Is eradication?
4537,Then say it and introduce the policies that make that achievable.
4538,"That includes lockdowns, international quarantines and many other unpalatable things."
4539,Is reducing the health care load and keeping the infections to a manageable level?
4540,"Well, probably the US are already there."
4541,I guess not before the election.

4557,My understanding has been that the reason this policy was not enacted in other states is concerns over discipline (how do you bar students fron campus when many schools have gotten rid of police officers post-BLM) and equity concerns (what happens if students whp refuse to wear masks come mainly from underprivileged groups?).
4558,"So what has changed that CA, a fairly liberal state, now feels able to implement this?"

4573,I guess we'll see how the experience of other countries looks a couple of months down the line.
4574,"The waning of sterilising antibodies was probably always an inevitability, it will be interesting to see how the T-cell immunity pans out since I remember the mRNA jabs eliciting strong responses there too in the immunogenicity trials."
4575,Philippines has population of 108 millions people.
4576,They need 216 millions doses of Pfizer (and probably more for booster shot).
4577,40 millions only covers 18% of population in few months.

4584,I am not a fan of the tests no longer being free.
4585,Why would they do that?
4586,Fully vaccinated people with symptoms should still test and quarantine if they are positive.
4587,I know their chances of spreading it are deceased but still you don't want a vulnerable person to die due to this policy of not encouraging testing.
4588,That is exactly what I thought.

4593,One of the reasons why Thailand chose AstraZeneca as its main vaccine.
4594,"I'd say most ""asymptomatic"" cases take none, because they don't have any symptoms and aren't being tested."
4595,"I use quotes because I'm not sure they're actually infected, or has their immune system neutralized the virus and the PCR test simply picking up the genetic material?"
4596,My personal assumption is that these constitute the majority in France.
4597,"So, yeah, that's a jolt to get them vaccinated."
4598,A strong indicator that this works is that the service used to register for vaccinations has been saturated since yesterday's announcements.
4599,Data coming out from Australia seemed to show that household infections were 100% due to the Delta variant in unvaccinated households.

4623,Israel had a huge Headstart on everybody else.
4624,"They had 30% of their population with at least one shot by the end of January, which is way, way ahead of everybody else-

https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations

So, a big chunk of their senior citizens are coming up on six months post vaccination."
4625,The reason you were hearing talk about senior citizens and people with health complications is because they are the first wave of people to hit the six month mark.
4626,"I doubt younger people will see such a big drop, but they likely *will* see a drop."
4627,The reason Israel was able to vaccinate such a big chunk of their population so insanely fast was because of the special deal they cut with Pfizer.
4628,"In exchange for getting early access, they would turn their entire country into an experiment of 10 million people."
4629,"Pfizer has access to all of their medical data, which they can use to fully assess how their vaccine is doing with time to respond in the rest of the world."
4630,"For that reason, I am very confident that Pfizer‚Äôs predictions about their own vaccine will come true."
4631,"There is no better test ground for analysis of their vaccine, and no other place on earth had such early mass adoption."
4632,"The UK was fast relative to most other places, but initially they were mostly using the Astra Zeneca shot, which is a different vaccine."
4633,"The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines do a good job targeting antibodies, but that is the immune response that subsides fastest for coronaviruses."
4634,I admit this is all just my own opinion.
4635,"But I think if you set a remind me for this post, it will turn out that that Pfizer vaccines did indeed turn out to become less effective after six months elsewhere, too."
4636,I think it‚Äôs just a matter of time before other countries catch up to Israel in terms of what they know.
4637,No vaccines are 100% effective
4638,Good enough for everyone to move on with their lives.
4639,"Europe seems to have reached vaccination saturation, like the US and UK before it."
4640,"Something like 70% of the worlds population don‚Äôt currently live in a rich enough country for one, but other than that, I agree."
4641,"If a psychologist was criticising cardiac specialists about how they did their double-by-passes, would you give the psychologist more weight than the cardiologist?"
4642,"Hold up, we're talking about where you would prefer to be *poor* here."
4643,"I hope you're not considering ""average household income"" to be ""poor""."
4644,"Also I'd be very skeptical of where they draw so-called average cost of living from, because most poor people live in rural areas where the cost of living is significantly lower than the average, and may not even factor into the survey data."
4645,&gt;Yes people work that long in America but they'll get paid extra.
4646,You still get paid for those hours in China.
4647,Maybe not time and a half or anything like that.
4648,Pretty sure neither do most US workers.
4649,&gt;But really their growth is from an embrace of capitalism and free markets.
4650,I suppose you want a mix of the two.
4651,But just a reminder that they do what they do as a result of a corrupt one party system that rules with an iron fist.
4652,"Correct, and yes I agree."
4653,"Instead of a all powerful party, I think we need some kind of specially elected decision making body that is awarded ""executive power"" for solving specific major challenges (like climate change, and homelessness)."
4654,"These should be elected from experts in the field (""expert"" being a combination of your entire resume, not just academic credentials)."
4655,"The collective wisdom of the US's climate and meteorological experts should be making the call about whether or not climate change is real, and if it is real, make mandatory goals with a strict deadlines and consequences for failure (like no salary for you senate and house politicians, or something)."
4656,"Never going to happen of course, because they'd have to vote for it in the first place, but one can dream, lol."
4657,Long covid is the scary unknown for sure.
4658,Have heard of the range of symptoms from loss of smell and taste to fatigue and shortness of breath.
4659,What‚Äôs also worrying is the study in Singapore about elevated inflammatory markers which could potentially lead to cardiovascular disease later on.
4660,"Again, mild can mean drastically different things."
4661,"But we shouldn't have governments, a captive market, allowing global corporations to use tax avoidance as a negotiating chip, either"
4662,"Actually, I have dealt with a lot of nurses."
4663,"They are usually the most wonderful people in the world, but the scientific education they get does not focus on analysis of data until the higher levels of nursing education."
4664,They are seen by patients as having a lot of medical knowledge.
4665,This makes their pronouncements that vaccines don't work particularly powerful for patients.
4666,There is a need to give more education on vaccines to nurses and others in the medical field.
4667,"I have had patients refuse vaccines because of something they heard from a clerk, a housekeeper, or a nursing assistant (true stories)."
4668,My doctor recently said everyone in the hospital (in an active area) is unvaccinated and with delta variant.
4669,[removed]
4670,I'm loving the progress I am seeing in Japan with the vaccine.
4671,About 15% increase in the total number of vaccinated in the past month.
4672,Things are progressing much more quickly there now.
4673,"I want to travel there next year, so that's especially great to hear for me!"
4674,"As i understand it, if you already have a weak immune-system, the vaccination won't produce as many antibodies as a normal person would, so with your weak immune-system and less antibodies, you'd still get hit harder than a normal person and probably wouldn't have survived without the vaccination."
4675,Someone correct me if i'm wrong.
4676,&gt;Throwing a life line works a lot better when you're out of the water yourself.
4677,"I thought this originally myself, but on further reflection the analogy isn't a good one given the tendency of the virus to mutate."
4678,It's entirely possible a new strain could emerge from an unprotected population that renders the protection on your own population less effective.
4679,Or to relate it back to the analogy; we might reach the shore only to find it eroding quickly away.
4680,"Hopefully not, but Delta has given a hint of what could happen."
4681,Thailand's main vaccine is still AstraZeneca.
4682,I myself was vaccinated with AZ dose 1.
4683,"But shhh, don't let the Sinophobic crowd knows that."
4684,Does this mean they are carriers and can still spread the variant?
4685,"They're making a choice about their body, nothing wrong with that"
4686,NHS details: Kids/teens get a series of 5 doses and that provides good long term immunity.
4687,You are also offered a booster during every pregnancy and if you tell them you are traveling to an area with limited medical facilities.
4688,"If you get a nasty wound, they may decide to give you a booster in the hospital."
4689,Edit to add that the booster you get in pregnancy is a combo vaccine and it‚Äôs mainly given to give the baby immunity from whooping cough (pertussis) until they can be vaccinated.
4690,Yes
4691,Thanks for sharing that.
4692,Read through it and the elevated inflammatory markers are worrying.
4693,Some people complain about CA schools mandating masks for kids in the next school year.
4694,They assume that kids catching covid is not a big deal due to it usually being mild.
4695,But it‚Äôs the long covid unknowns that worry me.
4696,"‚ÄúDr Barnaby Young, a consultant in NCID who was involved in the study, said: ""We understand from cases who passed on from acute Covid-19 that although the lungs are the major organ affected, the virus actually caused wider damage."""
4697,This included damage to the heart as well as the inner lining of small blood vessels.
4698,"In some individuals, the Sars-CoV-2 virus damages blood vessels, and in particular small vessels that are present in every part of the body, leading to blockage of the blood supply and bleeding, Dr Young said.‚Äù"
4699,Yeesh.
4700,What a mature response.
4701,üôÑ
4702,"Likely because the summary of Russia's entire history is *""and then it got worse""*"
4703,Thanks for misreading my entire post.
4704,Good job.
4705,I have the Pfizer vaccine thanks.
4706,Got vaccinated back in March.
4707,But please‚Ä¶continue to show how much you don‚Äôt understand what I said.
4708,They'll still have to mask up.
4709,Have you seen anything on duration of symptoms after vaccination?
4710,I‚Äôve read quite a few articles prevaccine that saw changes in chest imaging for all asymptomatic cases who were hospitalized for other reasons and a different study seeing almost exclusive increases in vascular inflammation/clotting markers.
4711,"The shots came with 5G, unlimited data."
4712,We're lucky in that our kids go to a small art-infused charter school that doesn't have to abide by the county rules and they are 100% willing to go distance learning the next day if they have even a suggestion that risk has increased.
4713,I'm not sure the vaccine will be available for my Littles by the time school starts but the school has at least shown itself to take science seriously.
4714,"üòíü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è But yeah, I wish I didn't love the South so much and could move away instead of feeling like I need to stay and fight for it."
4715,There's damn Q stickers you run into on cars frequently around here.
4716,"&gt;All in all, that‚Äôs a small number of dead."
4717,"Because we did all the mitigation efforts like stay at home, remote learning, work from home, etc...."
4718,Kids actually DONT play a big part when it comes to transmission.

4765,"If kid A isn't wearing mask properly, and continues to not wear it right, does kid A get sent out of class?"

4790,I don't get why you'd take the first shot and skip the second.
4791,That seems to go against vaccine skepticism to get at least one unless the side effects were severe.
4792,Is it just general forgetfulness and the need for follow-up from providers?
4793,Ok. I‚Äôll simplify: it‚Äôs more likely literally anything other than the vaccine than it is to be related to the vaccine.
4794,Perhaps a covid test is in order.

4823,This is primarily used to identify potential topics to further investigate with regards to vaccine reactions.
4824,"However, because the event data in VAERS is often not verified and is often self-reported, it should not be assumed that the adverse events in VAERS are actually associated with or cause by the vaccines, nor is it possible to estimate the frequency of these adverse events from these data."

4876,"Some people have a different risk assessment than you do and they have judged that for them, this virus isn't a threat."
4877,"To them, not getting the vaccine or wearing a mask is NBD for a virus with a 99.7% survival rate.They are only wearing the mask to do what is necessary, while at the same time maintain sovreignty."
4878,They are also tired of appeasing others.
4879,"They want to get back to normal, where they are able to exercise free will."
4880,"If you read the quote below, you can no longer claim to ""not get it."""
4881,"""You see, gentlemen, reason is an excellent thing, there's no disputing that, but reason is nothing but reason and satisfies only the rational side of man's nature, while will is a manifestation of the whole life, that is, of the whole human life including reason and all the impulses."
4882,"And although our life, in this manifestation of it, is often worthless, yet it is life and not simply extracting square roots."
4883,"Here I, for instance, quite naturally want to live, in order to satisfy all my capacities for life, and not simply my capacity for reasoning, that is, not simply one twentieth of my capacity for life."
4884,What does reason know?
4885,"Reason only knows what it has succeeded in learning (some things, perhaps, it will never learn; this is a poor comfort, but why not say so frankly?)"
4886,"and human nature acts as a whole, with everything that is in it, consciously or unconsciously, and, even if it goes wrong, it lives."
4887,"I suspect, gentlemen, that you are looking at me with compassion; you tell me again that an enlightened and developed man, such, in short, as the future man will be, cannot consciously desire anything disadvantageous to himself, that that can be proved mathematically."
4888,"I thoroughly agree, it can--by mathematics."
4889,"But I repeat for the hundredth time, there is one case, one only, when man may consciously, purposely, desire what is injurious to himself, what is stupid, very stupid--simply in order to have the right to desire for himself even what is very stupid and not to be bound by an obligation to desire only what is sensible."
4890,"Of course, this very stupid thing, this caprice of ours, may be in reality, gentlemen, more advantageous for us than anything else on earth, especially in certain cases."
4891,"And in particular it may be more advantageous than any advantage even when it does us obvious harm, and contradicts the soundest conclusions of our reason concerning our advantage--for in any circumstances it preserves for us what is most precious and most important--that is, our personality, our individuality."
4892,"Some, you see, maintain that this really is the most precious thing for mankind; choice can, of course, if it chooses, be in agreement with reason; and especially if this be not abused but kept within bounds."
4893,It is profitable and sometimes even praiseworthy.
4894,"But very often, and even most often, choice is utterly and stubbornly opposed to reason ... and ... and ... do you know that that, too, is profitable, sometimes even praiseworthy?"
4895,"Gentlemen, let us suppose that man is not stupid."
4896,"(Indeed one cannot refuse to suppose that, if only from the one consideration, that, if man is stupid, then who is wise?)"
4897,"But if he is not stupid, he is monstrously ungrateful!"
4898,Phenomenally ungrateful.
4899,"In fact, I believe that the best definition of man is the ungrateful biped."
4900,"But that is not all, that is not his worst defect; his worst defect is his perpetual moral obliquity, perpetual--from the days of the Flood to the Schleswig-Holstein period."
4901,Moral obliquity and consequently lack of good sense; for it has long been accepted that lack of good sense is due to no other cause than moral obliquity.
4902,Put it to the test and cast your eyes upon the history of mankind.
4903,What will you see?
4904,Is it a grand spectacle?
4905,"Grand, if you like."
4906,"Take the Colossus of Rhodes, for instance, that's worth something."
4907,"With good reason Mr. Anaevsky testifies of it that some say that it is the work of man's hands, while others maintain that it has been created by nature herself."
4908,Is it many-coloured?
4909,"May be it is many-coloured, too: if one takes the dress uniforms, military and civilian, of all peoples in all ages--that alone is worth something, and if you take the undress uniforms you will never get to the end of it; no historian would be equal to the job."
4910,Is it monotonous?
4911,"May be it's monotonous too: it's fighting and fighting; they are fighting now, they fought first and they fought last--you will admit, that it is almost too monotonous."
4912,"In short, one may say anything about the history of the world--anything that might enter the most disordered imagination."
4913,The only thing one can't say is that it's rational.
4914,The very word sticks in one's throat.
4915,"And, indeed, this is the odd thing that is continually happening: there are continually turning up in life moral and rational persons, sages and lovers of humanity who make it their object to live all their lives as morally and rationally as possible, to be, so to speak, a light to their neighbours simply in order to show them that it is possible to live morally and rationally in this world."
4916,"And yet we all know that those very people sooner or later have been false to themselves, playing some queer trick, often a most unseemly one."
4917,Now I ask you: what can be expected of man since he is a being endowed with strange qualities?
4918,"Shower upon him every earthly blessing, drown him in a sea of happiness, so that nothing but bubbles of bliss can be seen on the surface; give him economic prosperity, such that he should have nothing else to do but sleep, eat cakes and busy himself with the continuation of his species, and even then out of sheer ingratitude, sheer spite, man would play you some nasty trick."
4919,"He would even risk his cakes and would deliberately desire the most fatal rubbish, the most uneconomical absurdity, simply to introduce into all this positive good sense his fatal fantastic element."
4920,"It is just his fantastic dreams, his vulgar folly that he will desire to retain, simply in order to prove to himself--as though that were so necessary--that men still are men and not the keys of a piano, which the laws of nature threaten to control so completely that soon one will be able to desire nothing but by the calendar."
4921,"And that is not all: even if man really were nothing but a piano-key, even if this were proved to him by natural science and mathematics, even then he would not become reasonable, but would purposely do something perverse out of simple ingratitude, simply to gain his point."
4922,"And if he does not find means he will contrive destruction and chaos, will contrive sufferings of all sorts, only to gain his point!"
4923,"He will launch a curse upon the world, and as only man can curse (it is his privilege, the primary distinction between him and other animals), may be by his curse alone he will attain his object--that is, convince himself that he is a man and not a piano-key!"
4924,"If you say that all this, too, can be calculated and tabulated--chaos and darkness and curses, so that the mere possibility of calculating it all beforehand would stop it all, and reason would reassert itself, then man would purposely go mad in order to be rid of reason and gain his point!"
4925,"I believe in it, I answer for it, for the whole work of man really seems to consist in nothing but proving to himself every minute that he is a man and not a piano-key!"
4926,"It may be at the cost of his skin, it may be by cannibalism!"
4927,"And this being so, can one help being tempted to rejoice that it has not yet come off, and that desire still depends on something we don't know?"
4928,"You will scream at me (that is, if you condescend to do so) that no one is touching my free will, that all they are concerned with is that my will should of itself, of its own free will, coincide with my own normal interests, with the laws of nature and arithmetic."
4929,"Good heavens, gentlemen, what sort of free will is left when we come to tabulation and arithmetic, when it will all be a case of twice two make four?"
4930,Twice two makes four without my will.

5024,That plus it's very long incubation period means that there isn't much of a selection pressure to decrease virulence.
5025,I really don‚Äôt want a person in the health care system doing anything for me if they don‚Äôt believe in science.
5026,This post appears to be about vaccines.

5031,All that for nothing.
5032,Astrazeneca is chopped liver
5033,"Yes, but what tipped them off?"
5034,"Do they check on every one, or is it random, or..."
5035,"Yeah, but I'm betting they don't want it to seem rushed."
5036,Is Turkmenistan still claiming to have 0 cases?
5037,You're probably right.
5038,Blind optimism is not going to change the facts.
5039,That's me!
5040,"Took a lot of work managing the logistics to stay away from work that long, but well worth it."
5041,Got Pfizer x2
5042,Also us vaccinated Arkansans.
5043,We'll be the ones who find the vaccine resistant strains the hard way.
5044,"Since Pfizer and other vaccine producers are now saying that a third ""booster"" dose of their vaccine might eventually be needed to protect against different varieties of this virus, **I'd like to see more jurisdictions keep mask mandates in place until the boosters roll out."
5045,"**

(And/or until children can be vaccinated, but that's another story.)"
5046,"Sadly, I don‚Äôt think so."
5047,"Unless it‚Äôs their kid, not sure they would"
5048,"Yeah, Lamda emerged from Peru ‚òπÔ∏è I don‚Äôt believe there is much data on it yet as it‚Äôs so new."
5049,Our vaccines are anywhere between 64%-88% effective in preventing symptomatic infection for the Delta variants which concerns me.
5050,There‚Äôs still a level of protection for sure but not enough for me to feel safe honestly.
5051,Lots of breakthrough infections and no data on long covid for these fully vaccinated individuals.
5052,"It would seem like a pretty easy thing to do, but people here haven‚Äôt even really figured out how to make right turns when driving."
5053,Remembering to get a SECOND shot might just be too complicated for them.
5054,"From the article:

&gt;However, after checking with the laboratory that had supposedly conducted the test, it turned out that no test with the man‚Äôs reference numbers had been carried out, and that his name did not appear in the data either."
5055,I'm not sure whether they checked with the laboratory *because* the forgery was bad.
5056,"Not sure if they have the infrastructure to check every test result, but it could have been caught because it was randomly selected for confirmation as well."
5057,"They also reported that they caught 600 other fake test results, so they may be verifying test results from certain labs that are more likely to show up on forged results."
5058,I don't think we can assume that the forgery was bad from appearance alone.
5059,"The real dumb part is this:

&gt;The public prosecutor‚Äôs office in Halle-Vilvoorde first offered the man a settlement of ‚Ç¨750, but he refused."
5060,"He also did not appear in court, and was sentenced in absentia to a prison term of one year and a fine of ‚Ç¨4,000."
5061,"Weird how ""level 0"" isn't actually level 0 as you'd imagine it."
5062,Exactly.

5095,I understand how vaccines work.
5096,That wasn't my point as we were talking about masks.

5114,What‚Äôs the point of FDA approval if an emergency order negates it and then retroactively makes it approved cause they don‚Äôt want to scare people?
5115,In the next two months they are going to be surging past us

5130,"You‚Äôre right, I wasn‚Äôt clear sorry - it‚Äôs just that giving shots at my job has been like a consistent sinking ship especially during the first 4 months."
5131,We‚Äôve even had a few allergic reactions during those periods and honestly I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs probably safer to get vaccinated at a government site where there‚Äôs adequate staffing than at a pharmacy where we‚Äôre trying not to sink ship.
5132,I‚Äôd hope that by now everyone who‚Äôs wanted a shot for their child has already found one and that when moderna does include more ages the rush isn‚Äôt so bad as it was initially.
5133,Also the reason why I mention flu season is that in 2020 they allowed giving shots to 4+ year olds at pharmacies and the amount of crying the kids do make ME want to cry.
5134,The parallels to the Influenza Pandemic a hundred years continue onwards..
5135,This is news to me and a positive for Pfizer.

5137,Thanks for sharing!
5138,Yep!
5139,Delta is changing the game.
5140,Was a few weeks away from buying plane tickets after getting vaccinated.
5141,Definitely going to wait
5142,You draw the line when everyone has access to the vaccine and is able to make the choice to get it based on availability.
5143,Access for all ages in the US is expected by the end of the year.
5144,"Institutions that want to require vaccines can do so, and employees can use these decisions to inform if they want to continue working where they are or if they need to seek out a new employer."

5146,Most likely less than 6 months.

5149,"Right now the media craze is ""why isn't the world equal?!"""
5150,It's idiotic.
5151,It's not 0.8% of vaccinated people die from covid.
5152,It's 0.8% of people who died from covid are vaccinated.
5153,HUGE difference.
5154,Looks like sometime in August it will drop again
5155,Same.
5156,I have an 18 month old over here as well.
5157,Yup.
5158,Indonesian.
5159,I personally knew several people who travelled to the US to get vaccinated.
5160,I am waiting til it‚Äôs approved!
5161,It won‚Äôt happen.
5162,It will get worse.
5163,Depressing
5164,as someone who is high risk I'm not looking to be part of the 30%
5165,I still have issues from Epstein Barr after having mono over 20 years ago.
5166,We just have no idea what's to come later on down the road post infection.
5167,I'm trying to do everything I can to protect my child from finding out.
5168,It saddens me to see so many parents having their kids ditch masks with zero protection.
5169,"You mean like Cuba's lung cancer vaccine, that they recently made?"
5170,The one you probably can't get due to the States of America waging economic war on them?
5171,That vaccine?
5172,It's no big deal to the rest of us until the Arkansas variant arises and we find out that mRNA vaccines are only 40% effective or something...
5173,These places are incubators keeping the pandemic going for the rest of the world.
5174,"&gt; I know that the Delta variant hits the younger population harder than previous variants

Does it?"
5175,"I've seen no data to show this to be true, but I'd look at any source you're able to provide."
5176,"All I've seen is that with most older people vaccinated and having fewer cases and fewer hospitalizations, the proportion of young people among cases and among hospitalizations has risen."
5177,Delta just spreads faster because it's more contagious/
5178,"&gt; The Dutch public health institute said that of the infections that could be traced to their source, 37% happened in a hospitality venue such as a bar or club."
5179,"Infections among people ages 18-24 surged by 262%, followed by a 191% rise in 25-29 year-olds."
5180,.
5181,.
5182,.
5183,"&gt;More than 46% of the Netherlands‚Äô adult population is fully vaccinated, and more than 77% of the country‚Äôs adults have had at least one shot."
5184,Health authorities said more than 1.3 million people would receive their first or second doses this week.
5185,"the article also states

&gt;Despite the alarming rise in confirmed cases, hospital admissions increased by a modest 11%, or 60 COVID-19 patients, over the week, the institute said."
5186,Twelve of the admissions were to intensive care units.
5187,Time will tell what this last bit means.
5188,"Hospitalization spikes usually trail behind infection spikes by a week or two, so things may take a turn for the worse."
5189,"On the other hand, it sounds like a lot of the new cases are young folk who tend to have a lower hospitalization rate than older patients, so maybe not."
5190,These statements sound like they‚Äôre somewhat sensationalized.
5191,I have yet to see a real medical study on long COVID for people who weren‚Äôt hospitalized.
5192,Even the study in the article is based on survey data of people giving self diagnosed symptoms of ‚Äúbrain fog‚Äù and anxiety.
5193,There are a number of things that could cause those symptoms.
5194,"It seems a bit misleading to be phrasing these statements as if they‚Äôre proven facts, when they‚Äôre far from it."
5195,Fully support those individuals and the plan they come up to seek a solution.
5196,Most likely with support from their family doctor they can find a good way to get protection.
5197,"According to the science, if you have had the vaccine you don‚Äôt need to worry."
5198,Jesus.
5199,I can't imagine taking all these different OTC medications at once!
5200,I guess I come from a household that never really took all these pain relievers.
5201,"When we get a cold or whatnot, we only take a dose of nyquil, and only if it's a nasty cold."
5202,Tylenol is reserved for severe pain or headaches.
5203,Everything else we pretty much bear through it.
5204,Being so willy nilly about taking all this shit would throw up all the red flags for me!!
5205,"I guess we've been raised with mindset of ""grin and bear it."""
5206,Cool.
5207,Good job getting vaccinated.
5208,I am too.
5209,We've got a lot in common.
5210,can you imagine the backlash and chaos if they dont get approved?
5211,of course theyll get approved.
5212,"My best friend is a high school teacher, so I can understand the frustration."
5213,But one can hope.
5214,They will still know better than the career scientists.
5215,The excuses will come.
5216,Yeah neither do I.
5217,"Given that we‚Äôre nearly a year and a half into this and still seeing spikes, and also reports of vaccinated people catching the delta variant (which seems to be more common than we‚Äôre being told), we‚Äôre probably going to be doing all of this for a couple of more years, huh?"
5218,I REALLY hope that isn‚Äôt the case.
5219,I felt good about getting my vaccine but now I‚Äôm just losing hope.
5220,How is COVID still a problem a year and a half later when we have vaccines??

5222,Post-approval monitoring is not unusual.

5224,"""within 6 months"", could it not be earlier then?"

5226,You have a source that shows this article is wrong?
5227,6 months ago people were going to other states in the US to jump the line and get the vaccine.
5228,Now everyone who cares has had the shot and we are doing raffles just to get people vaccinated.
5229,I don't think they have solid data yet.
5230,Those are exactly the long term effects I'm concerned about (plus neurological issues and changes in grey matter in the brain) for both adults and all of the unvaccinated children out there.
5231,"Strange, we are doing much better than most countries"
5232,[removed]
5233,That‚Äôs not the case here.
5234,The state changed its policy 4.5 hours after releasing it.
5235,Vaccinations aren't 100% and even people with a mild disease can develop long COVID.
5236,Why assume otherwise?
5237, Currently teaching 6th Grade ELA summer school.
5238,There‚Äôs not a lot of hope.
5239,My vaccine-hesitant dad did something similar to me in April.
5240,"He complained that he was feeling sick, and I asked if it was possibly COVID and encouraged him to get tested, but he dismissed the idea (to my surprise, since he had been concerned about getting COVID in the past)."
5241,"It wasn't until a few weeks later, when I was sending him screenshots of open Pfizer/Moderna appointments in his area to ""nudge"" him to get a shot, when he finally admitted he had gotten J&amp;J in early April, like 3 days before the pause."
5242,"Like you, I was happy, but a part of me was like, were you ever gonna tell me?"
5243,Lol.
5244,It's literally insane.
5245,Why are you not listening to the science?
5246,No
5247,By overcrowding hospitals antivaxxers a threat to everyone.

5257,Oh trust the mental gymnastics they'll make up something else
5258,Were we doing that before?
5259,"Seriously, I have had to tone it down."
5260,I will joke with friends and family but some people who are anti-vax latch onto anything.
5261,I am just curious.
5262,Is this how she plans to live forever?
5263,If the vaccine isn‚Äôt enough then what would be?
5264,It just seems like a stressful way to live.
5265,"Yeah, it sucks."
5266,Our office just returned with 4 days a week.
5267,"They gave us one additional Friday off - we had flex Fridays before (wow, so brave of them)."
5268,"Unvaccinated folks have to wear a mask, but I am vaccinated and don't."
5269,Only seems like a matter of time before we get sick.
5270,"Look, I am for returning to normal, but the office stuff is just dumb and pointless."
5271,"I can do 90% of my job remotely, but because the higher ups are obsessed with ""butts in the seat"" and having meetings, here I am."
5272,"So just be fortunate that it is 2 days a month, but I feel ya."
5273,100% the reason.
5274,I had to leave work early the next day after my second shot because I was so ‚Äúout of it‚Äù.
5275,"Tired, weak and no energy for a couple days."
5276,My first shot was a piece of cake.
5277,Many people probably figure they have good enough protection after the first shot so choose not to get fed second.
5278,Yep it will only be because of mandatory reasons.
5279,The vast majority of people who didn't get the vaccine aren't just waiting for full approval it's just a right wing talking point they use to prove that they are the logical ones.
5280,Never mind the fact that they are able to walk around now with a lot less risk and relatively safe (in high vaccination areas) because of the people that got the emergency approval vaccine.
5281,Because you keep pushing the point even after I made clear I disagreed.
5282,I didn't make an argument against doing our own monitoring.
5283,Probably a combination of two factors.
5284,The new strain being slightly more lethal/slightly higher IFR.
5285,The last peak could have had less testing/higher rate of undiscovered infections.
5286,But the bigger takeaway is that Russia was poor at vaccinating the elderly/at risk population.
5287,"Other countries are seeing the exact opposite now, with much lower rates of fatalities and hospitalisation."
5288,"no, RNA/nucleic acids aren‚Äôt made up of proteins."
5289,Multiple jobs have required vaccines as a condition to work them.
5290,"Healthcare, research and military all being examples."
5291,Many also require proof of immunity so there is no question whether someone has protection.

5294,They submit your information to a digital registry but would be surprised if most places check that registry before giving you the vaccine.
5295,I bet it would be pretty easy to get a third shot if you wanted it.
5296,Walk into a few pharmacy‚Äôs or grocery stores and I bet you will have your third shot.
5297,I‚Äôm just saying if you really want one it wouldn‚Äôt be hard to get.
5298,"Yeah, I understand the sentiment."

5301,I just wanted to offer a perspective about the initial downvotes.
5302,No worries!
5303,Well you'd think the pro-life camp would be pro life but not much about super religious people and their decisions make much sense.
5304,"Yes, why do our own monitoring, when we can...(checks notes)...slowly and reactively look at if we're having the same problems as Israel."
5305,I don‚Äôt necessarily think people need to do that as much as they need to be more clear about whether something they‚Äôre saying is an opinion or something they think is factual

5311,No consideration of the kids huh?
5312,Or the NHS workers that have to care for the thousands over the exit wave?
5313,"Yep I know several people waiting for ""full approval"" but I know very well they won't get it then.. it will be a new excuse like ""well cases are barely around so I'm not taking any vaccine risks period"""

5317,Agreed.

5320,"But those concerns could fall by the wayside if new data from Israel, expected in the next several weeks, shows conclusively that immunity wanes after six to eight months, significantly raising the risks for the elderly or other vulnerable populations."""

5350,Some people really need to learn how to improve their epistemological skills before they post on here.
5351,Your emotions and anxieties are not necessarily tied to reality.
5352,"Before you make a claim, you better have real evidence to back that up, otherwise you‚Äôre going to look like an irrational moron."
5353,How would they infect others if they‚Äôre dead/dying/confined to a hospital bed?
5354,Why do you care for people who don‚Äôt care for you?
5355,"Don‚Äôt be a martyr, there‚Äôs no god and you won‚Äôt be rewarded."
5356,[deleted]
5357,I would love to know that they do - it would make sense.
5358,Good.
5359,It‚Äôs what every country should be doing.
5360,No different than showing an ID to drink or enter a nightclub.
5361,Why should we care?
5362,dying of covid is now a choice in America
5363,But blind optimism is what‚Äôs going to open the country and get the people back to not being muzzled by the government forcing them to wear masks \s
5364,you're very ignorant if you think people who received the vaccine were going to continue to wear masks.
5365,what was the cdc supposed to say?
5366,get vaxxed but your life is still being controlled bc some people dont want to get a life saving vaccine?
5367,its intention was to provide incentive to get the vaccine and return to normal.
5368,did it work?
5369,"not really, but people are really stupid."
5370,"its not the cdc's fault imo tho, the local govt of mississippi sure as hell could have done more to protect their citizens"
5371,This is Mississippi.
5372,There is a 50-60% chance the parents of these kids would not allow them to be vaccinated.
5373,The state is filled with idiots that still think they'll have aluminum cans stuck to them after being vaccinated.
5374,Sad and unfortunate.
5375,You can't convince someone of something if their sense of self depends on believing the opposite.
5376,"In these places, their sense of self is *highly* wrapped up in whatever Fox, OANN, and Newsmax have told them."
5377,Those agencies *are* their way of life.
5378,And we're all cranking up for fully opened schools in 6 weeks.
5379,It's not going to go well.
5380,"I‚Äôm still amazed they thought that system would work, oof."
5381,"Irresponsible for people to take advantage, but still!"
5382,Shouldn‚Äôt have to do this if you‚Äôre vaccinated.
5383,Live to breathe free.
5384,"The evidence points to reduced perceived symptoms for delta, if infected."
5385,However I‚Äôve yet to see anything published (not that I‚Äôve read everything!)
5386,"that says things like ground glass opacities, clotting, and inflammation markers are improved - all of which are very common in asymptomatic/mild cases."
5387,Happy to check out any links you‚Äôve found on post vaccination physiological symptoms measured by labs or radiology.
5388,Yeah and I know of people who probably got marked as a missed second shot.
5389,They got their first further away at the only place that had them.
5390,Second shot comes around and they are pretty much widely available now.
5391,They just get it at the local pharmacy nearby instead of driving far away to the original location they got their first shot at.

5395,ASAP?
5396,I really don't give a toss about the 'Hospitality Industry' opening up when it's being weighed against tens of thousands of young people suffering from long term Covid.
5397,Bitter?
5398,You sound like someone more than happy to trade human wellbeing for profit - which is precisely what I've observed from the 'Hospitality Industry' for the last 15 months.
5399,The vast majority of the 'Hospitality Industry' doesn't give a toss about people as long as they can extract cash from them.
5400,Nasty little group of people we'd be better without.
5401,"Other places are tracking that, and it's not like Americans are a new species so we can't use their data."
5402,I did.
5403,I just don't agree with the conclusions.
5404,"Seriously, I think we should err on the side of caution, even if inconvenient."
5405,"Wish we‚Äôd done the same in Canada; of all indoor public places, transit seems like the most important place to mask up, especially on trains/subways with limited ventilation."
5406,Man I‚Äôm just fed up with people spreading misinformation.
5407,I guess it would be better if I‚Äôd added a source to the initial comment.
5408,But I thought it was pretty common knowledge in this sub.
5409,It was a big deal when they announced it could be stored at higher temperatures.
5410,"Your comment is alluding to some government conspiracy so, yes, it was removed."
5411,"Plus Pfizer and Moderna could market the vaccine themselves, running ads to influence people who are hesitant."
5412,I suppose it did make a lot of money for Orb√°n and his cronies so that's good for them I guess.
5413,Yeah.
5414,There was never an ironclad way of proving you DON'T have it.
5415,If it's positive you definitely have it tho.
5416,My dad had MS and died of COVID in April 2020.
5417,So I know how hard it is.
5418,"Best of luck, and don‚Äôt let these bullies get to you."
5419,"I, with no immune issues and in relatively good health, will continue to mask up indoors despite dual pfizer shots because of people like you."
5420,"Wait, they don't have full approval?"
5421,"I believe even in the US that's still the recommendation from the CDC, and federal buildings still require them."
5422,Yes and no.
5423,"In terms of safety, it is a formality, the vaccines are known to be safe, but the duration of protection is unknown thus far."
5424,In terms of legality it makes a significant difference.
5425,"While with the EUA the government could make it essentially de facto required to get the vaccine by leveling large consequences for refusal, that is a shady work around and would likely be challenged in lengthy court battles."
5426,"Once fully approved, the government could, if so inclined, actually force people to get the vaccine."
5427,"As for private entities they could technically require vaccination to remain employed/become employed by them, but having full approval would make it much more palatable to do so."
5428,"Many companies, while keeping things voluntary, have explicitly said ""we are not requiring vaccination **at this moment**, which heavily implies they have plans to in the future."
5429,"Once fully approval goes through, I expect nearly every government job will require vaccination."
5430,Federal especially.
5431,"States can try to hold off, but when the feds threaten to withhold funding, that usually crumbles pretty quickly, and most states are likely to require it before it is even suggested."
5432,"And then all the people who claim they aren't getting it because it's not full approved will get it, right?....."
5433,right?
5434,"I‚Äôm trying to hang on, but it‚Äôs such an impediment to international travel that I will consider dropping out and getting an approved vaccine if this limbo continues"
5435,Why is there no discussion about it in this subreddit.
5436,Almost looks like negative news about the vaccines are moderated away.
5437,"Lying is legal in most cases, using forged documents and breaking pandemic measures are not."
5438,"Vaccines, actually."
5439,"Russia has four vaccines: two vector vaccines, Sputnik V and Sputnik Light, inactivated whole virion vaccine CoviVac and somewhat questionable vaccine EpiVacCorona made by state-controlled/ex-military lab (which is known to be making bio-weapons back in Soviet Union)."
5440,"It is mostly anti vaxxers (Russia is a world leader in antivaxx movement), there are other people who oppose everything or people waiting for other vaccines (I believe they just using it as an excuse to not get vaccinated) but they can be ignored."
5441,not too many of them anyways.
5442,"The real problem is anti vaxx movement: bloggers, mass media, politicians, public figures, medical workers, scientists who oppose mandatory vaccination/vaccination overall."
5443,"On top of that very confusing response to Covid itself, like when some Russian regions tried to impose semi-mandatory vaccination, Moscow opposed that claiming it's against the law, but now they try to do it themselves."
5444,"Using Covid lockdowns for political reasons, like to stop mass protests and then canceling lockdowns  to vote in Constitution referendum and so on."
5445,Hardly anyone is wearing a mask.
5446,"Well, some people do wear mask properly (\~10%, and I believe mostly vaccinated people), but most people wear masks on their hands or legs."

5449,"&gt; let the unvaccinated ones suffer the consequences

those consequences also include them becoming variant factories that might be vaccine resistant."
5450,When did every become so dumb and selfish?
5451,"First of all, I don‚Äôt know where are you from so just to be clear my goal isn‚Äôt to be mean or mock your ideas, just expressing my opinions as a French citizen."
5452,"That thing said, here the contamination are going up, and going up at a very alarming rate."
5453,"From there we have a choice to make, because we will have restrictions again there is no other possibilities."
5454,"So now we have (i mean the government) have 2 choices :
- we close restaurant, cinema, museum etc‚Ä¶ for everyone again
- we close only for unvaccinated people

What‚Äôs the fairest option ?"
5455,Closing for everyone mean that those who were vaccinated also get the blame even if they are protected and protect their relatives.
5456,Closing for unvaccinated mean technically discriminating against unvaccinated.
5457,I vaccinated myself voluntary.
5458,"As well as all my family, because we respected social distancing."
5459,"I didn‚Äôt saw my grandma for a year, even if she live 1h of road afar."
5460,"We followed the rules, and now we are free so see again (and we had a great meal at restaurant !)."
5461,This is liberty.
5462,My liberty stops where the liberty of others start.
5463,"My liberty is now to go out, to go to restaurant, to see my family."
5464,Unvaccinated people are the one to blame if we have a 4th wave.
5465,"If they close again, this is their fault and not our."
5466,"By choosing their liberty to not vaccine, they cause restrictions, so they are infringing our liberty."
5467,You have still have the right to not vaccinate you know.
5468,But this come with a cost.
5469,"Frankly, I find it funny, when you make people face their responsibilities they say it‚Äôs unfair and against their freedom."
5470,"But truth is that unvaccinated people, and even worse antivaxx, kill people."
5471,Yes by their actions people die.
5472,"When you see that people still die from teatanus in France, I still don‚Äôt understand why those people are not in court for homicide."
5473,"TL:DR : unvaccinated people will cause restrictions, therefore it‚Äôs infringing my liberty to go out."
5474,Time for my weekly dose of the AZ vaccine bashing /s
5475,"I mean, what did they think was going to happen?"
5476,After seeing what a contentious topic masks were for the last year?
5477,Surely they knew that a sizable portion of the country would ditch the masks without getting vaccinated.
5478,"Not to mention that vaccinated people can spread the virus, but the CDC isn't tracking breakthrough cases that don't result in hospitalization or death, so we don't know exactly how much vaccinated people are spreading it."
5479,"A woman today told me this is all ""nothing to worry about, 98% survival rate and she has God on her side"" Some of these people can't be helped."
5480,‚ÄúFreedom fries‚Äù was also pretty ridiculous.
5481,[removed]
5482,"I mean, every person's bag and ticket gets checked at an airport, I would be shocked if they didn't also check every persons test or vaccination."
5483,"Yeah, we need that info pubic, so people can successfully cheat."
5484,That is fair.
5485,It‚Äôs sad to think that even if a vaccine was approved for those under 12 how many wouldn‚Äôt get it because of their idiot parents.
5486,I‚Äôm california and other states there is a literal digital registry.
5487,They would know.
5488,It is sad that such a law is even necessary.
5489,Out of all the people out there health workers should know the importance and usefulness of vaccinations the most.
5490,I haven‚Äôt seen a breakdown of symptomatic for the vaccinated with Delta.
5491,I hope the sniffles and a cough are considered symptomatic but hospitalizations are still dramatically down.
5492,He would say that
5493,"Definitely some will, hopefully most will but not everyone will and that's still ok."
5494,"That bot's aren't bad, but the people on here are."
5495,"Also, just no."
5496,You‚Äôre conflating two things.
5497,It does not use fetal stem cells in the context to which they object (cells taken from an aborted fetus).
5498,"It is only by some lazy linguistic twists that this argument even exists, and a doctor should be able to shut it down."
5499,"https://www.nebraskamed.com/COVID/you-asked-we-answered-do-the-covid-19-vaccines-contain-aborted-fetal-cells

Neither MRNA vaccine used an abortion derived cell line at any point in its testing or development."

5501,"You realize a lot of people won‚Äôt bother getting tested over a runny nose or a headache, right?"
5502,Especially during cold and flu season.
5503,That‚Äôs a lot of ‚Äúmild‚Äù cases walking around.
5504,"If you care so much about the vulnerable (kids, immunocompromised, etc."
5505,"), then you‚Äôd support maintaining a strong defense against *infection*."
5506,I‚Äôll do whatever it takes to get a booster.
5507,I hope the ‚Äúhappy to get infected crowd‚Äù enjoys their quarantine.
5508,I do sincerely hope you don‚Äôt infect the defenseless with your ‚Äúmild‚Äù case.
5509,"Good point, mistake on my part."
5510,"She was concerned about the blood clots reported in recipients earlier this year but I did the research with her and showed her it was from J&amp;J and AZ and that she could opt for one of the mRNA ones instead if that would make her feel better, and those are the most common ones we have in our area anyway."
5511,"She also saw her cousin, another fence sitter in the same age group as her (late teens/early 20s) get vaccinated last week with no effects so that was also somewhat influential."
5512,I also told her how easy it was/described the process because she thought it was more difficult than it really is to obtain one at this point lol
5513,It is most certainly not both sides.
5514,Exactly ONE side has been anti-vax and anti-mask and anti-health.
5515,"Democrats care about people BECAUSE THEY ARE PEOPLE, not for political reasons."
5516,"Nope, they'll just move the goalpost."
5517,[deleted]
5518,[removed]
5519,Well then maybe there should be some stricter regulations regarding the vaccines?
5520,"Rather than incentivizing people, let the unvaccinated ones suffer the consequences, they‚Äôre likely degenerates anyways."
5521,"I am the same way but everyone is different, and many people assume over the counter is totally safe to mix and match (despite warning labels, which HAVE made a difference.. it used to be even worse back in the 80s and 90s)."

5527,"Wow, thanks for the write up"
5528,Who calls hundreds of thousands of deaths a ‚Äúsmall number‚Äù?
5529,That is sick and so jaded.
5530,"ALL of those people had lives, friends, and family who cared about them."
5531,They mattered even if you think they didn‚Äôt.
5532,So is the argument though that they refuse anything that involves stem cells at some point in its development?
5533,Because I‚Äôm sure there are ample counter examples that they don‚Äôt object to.
5534,"Have inactivated virus vaccines (Sinopharm, Sinovac) updated the strain used since they began manufacturing?"
5535,What‚Äôs the # 1 rule in academia?
5536,"If it isn‚Äôt published, it doesn‚Äôt exist"
5537,It's of interest in assessing vaccination policies.
5538,"Where I live the policy is to offer vaccines to the over-12s, but not everywhere is doing this."
5539,"If we knew the age profile of kids suffering severe effects we'd be able to assess how safe younger kids are when there is such a policy, and also how helpful such a policy is likely to be in reducing risks for kids as a whole."
5540,Just a data point that could be useful.
5541,I think they were initially downvoted because their comment comes off as unnecessarily combative against someone who didn't have any apparent indication of intentionally spreading misinformation.
5542,It's possible to correct without being accusatory.
5543,Preprint articles require a higher degree of scrutiny and rigor to accurately evaluate than many other types of articles.

5570,History's emotional reach is surprisingly long.
5571,It's an argument based in eugenics there.
5572,There are plenty of people who either can't get vaccinated or are unlikely to see major benefits from vaccination because of immune system issues.
5573,"And of course, plenty of kids *are* suffering because of this even if we ignore the kids that get sick or die themselves; I do feel sorry for you if you think that losing one of your parents or another close family member when you were a child wouldn't have been a negative thing for you."
5574,That sounds like a very abusive family you had.
5575,The virus isn't going away for years or decades in the US because of the number of people who are aiding and abetting COVID to kill people.
5576,Schools could probably get back to mostly normal once the situation is such that all children (barring strict medical exemptions) are required to be vaccinated.

5583,"Chile reported 1278 new cases today, it‚Äôs the lowest number of daily infections in 2021 so far."
5584,I feel like the people in healthcare who are against the vaccine should be reevaluated.
5585,How can people make it far enough to be a professional and yet not understand how vaccines work or believe in them?
5586,It's crazy to me.
5587,I'm in camp 1.
5588,I trust the vaccines; the likelyhood of getting a breakthrough infection that makes me sick is so low it's not worth worrying about.
5589,"I do respect people in camp 2, though."
5590,"If you want to take precautions, feel free."
5591,"I won't judge you, all I ask is that you not judge me for being in camp 1."
5592,"While that is true, it‚Äôs different when other people who chose not to be ignorant are harmed by the ignorance of others."
5593,"So if someone decides not to get vaccinated, they could infect someone else who wants to get vaccinated but can‚Äôt because of a medical issue or they are not eligible (ie children under 12)."

5596,Of course they are going to have their name on their product I guess you need to pick up a law book and go read I know you won‚Äôt do that though but it probably help you out with a lot
5597,"Without being too political, is there any specific information if it‚Äôs up in particular demographics?"
5598,"Urban/Rural, vaccinated/unvaccinated, etc?"
5599,Some states with lower vaccination rates must have disproportionate higher cases per capita right?
5600,It's basic risk assessment.
5601,As I explained above.
5602,The risk of death or hospitalization is much higher if you don't wear a seatbelt while driving than with COVID.
5603,Even for the elderly.

5624,deaths haven't been following an uptick in cases really since the past winter.
5625,they won't follow this much less deadly delta variant either - which has been the dominant strain in the US for several months now.
5626,We'd been seeing an uptick in deaths instead of the current decline right now if that was the case.
5627,Missouri - which has been hard hit with the Delta variant in a predominantly unvaxxed population is only averaging like 7 deaths a week currently.

5717,The mRNA is not itself detected by the immune system to generate antibodies.
5718,Instead it enters your cells and is translated into proteins that are displayed on the cell membrane and are detected by the immune system.
5719,Most of the other things you are saying are presented as conjecture and probably shouldn't be trusted given your misunderstanding of basic facts.

5753,"&gt; Both authorization and approval are rigorous processes that look at the safety and efficacy of a vaccine, Moss said."
5754,"A key difference between the two is that at least two months of follow-up data from phase 3 clinical trials are considered for authorization, versus at least six months for approval."
5755,https://abcnews.go.com/Health/full-fda-approval-drive-covid-19-vaccinations-experts/story?id=78048166
5756,&gt;I just do not believe the government should have this power.
5757,Same here in France.
5758,"I also fear that plenty of marginalised people weren't able to get vaccinated yet (homeless, migrants, you name it), and they might end up just a little more excluded from society."
5759,"So then how would you suggest they indicate a 500% increase, if not by saying a 500% increase?"
5760,"We're seeing cases explode in a lot of places; the UK was just the canary in the coal mine because they got Delta early and they sequence more than anyone, and Israel was the canary for how a new variant can cut into a country that had something like herd immunity for the previous versions."
5761,How high it gets and how much the immunity provides a firewall against serious cases are yet to be seen.
5762,"It won't be as bad as before, but there's a lot of hosts left."
5763,"I think there was a lot of overconfidence in the ability of vaccines to prevent another wave, even though we'd seen many highly-vaccinated countries like Chile lose control of it (though it's coming down now)."
5764,It was sort of dismissed because Chinese vaccines aren't as good as the Western ones.
5765,"But it's not really that surprising when you take into account that vaccines aren't perfect, a lot of adults aren't vaccinated, most children aren't vaccinated, and young people are no longer afraid that they'll land their grandma in the hospital if they go out and party (and they weren't afraid of the virus personally, even before vaccines)."
5766,"And finally, though we haven't seen many serious reinfections (if the new variants completely overrode infection from the old versions, we'd see it in places that got hit hard more than once), there are still a lot of susceptible people out there, because, believe it or not, no one has ""let it rip"" and we've never seen what it would be like if everyone got it, unmitigated."
5767,"Hopefully, thanks to vaccines, we never will."
5768,"But I don't think governments have quite prepared people for the fact that this virus will be with us forever, that we can't stop it from mutating somewhere in the world, and we really are going to have to ""live with it."""
5769,I also posed a hypothetical scenario to point out both safety and timely matter.
5770,The world is bigger than New Zealand and the US.
5771,There were lock downs in Europe and other countries that also resulted in high infection rates (some higher per capita than the US).
5772,"One could argue that assholes are everywhere, and thus part of human existence."
5773,New Zealand is a literal island of 5M people where shutting down is more feasible than a third of a continent of 330M people.
5774,"That is like comparing New York City to a small wealthy gated suburb and say that it‚Äôs possible to have no crime, just that New York has assholes and deserves it."
5775,Masks and rules are effective at slowing down the spread but not nearly as effective as vaccines that can eliminate a virus.

5788,I thought this was common sense.
5789,I got my first shot back in December last year.
5790,I was so very wrong because many of my coworkers still refuse to get the vaccine.
5791,Right where my family lives.
5792,"I'm glad you posted this, my mom was asking for the grandkids and I to go to MS with her (Jackson area) in August."
5793,That's about to be a big nope especially if the family there isn't vaccinated.
5794,K-12 has campus's?
5795,"Indeed this, even for N=1, stands (a bit) against placebo effect often claimed by long covid detractors."
5796,"I'm getting my numbers here: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html

It shows 79% of the 65+ group ""fully"" vaccinated, but 89% have 1 dose, which provides some protection."

5804,"You‚Äôre always out there screaming ‚Äúall lives matter,‚Äù but I guess covid is the exception, huh?"
5805,"I don‚Äôt assume that, but looking at the total numbers from 18 months in, it is pretty suggestive that kids are at the lowest risk of severe Covid or death."
5806,Are there outliers?
5807,"Sure, but that‚Äôs always going to be the case with every single infectious pathogen."
5808,Hospitalizations among kids in that age group accounted for like 1% of all.
5809,"I don‚Äôt like comparisons to the flu for a number of reasons but in freaking out over Covid in kids, we forget how bad the flu can be."
5810,In 2019 kids under 18 accounted for almost 10% of flu hospitalizations.
5811,We‚Äôve always just accepted that risk as a fact of life.

5813,This is true but it is because countries in the west in the end scaled up better.

5816,Now its administration.
5817,People can‚Äôt be blamed for believing wrong things when they don‚Äôt have all the facts and knowledge yet.
5818,"If people believed the sun revolved around the earth because they hadn‚Äôt yet advanced astronomically, it‚Äôs not willful stupidity, it‚Äôs doing the best they can with the information and technology they have."
5819,People today don‚Äôt really have that excuse in a world where you can fact check with a google search.
5820,I do and I know I'm not at risk and the vaccine had no long term studies.
5821,That's my opinion.
5822,Don't harass me for it.
5823,Cancer isn‚Äôt a highly contagious disease that can be prevented with a vaccine.

5842,"Will very likely not overwhelm hospitals, even in the least vaccinated states since vaccines are concentrated among the most vulnerable."

5852,Probably a couple more months for me to get my first jab

5856,Well.....those people are idiots.
5857,Fuck em.
5858,"Cautious to not sound like an anti-vaxer, because I‚Äôm not, but would it be beneficial after vaccination to be exposed to the virus every once in a while to keep the immune system on standby to attack the virus?"
5859,Would this be a decent argument for why those vaccinated shouldn‚Äôt wear masks?
5860,It would be like a booster shot in itself as long as most people immunized are asymptomatic.
5861,"500k does at $25 each (That's what the US pays for them), I would put my flag on it too."

5875,Isreal is having less than 5 deaths per day and the Uk is getting around 30.
5876,Very sad to see these people pass but it is a hell of a lot better than before.
5877,Remember the UK has 60 million people in it.
5878,"Did a third of the ones that tested negative in Spain test positive in Belgium, or did a third of the ones that tested positive in Belgium, test negative in Spain?"
5879,There's a huge difference between the two.
5880,Show us evidence that it benefits them.
5881,Not increase in antibody titers but actual reduction in cases
5882,There are some crazy ass people in this country and it makes me sad
5883,Kids are the least at-risk for contracting COVID.
5884,Why such a push to get the younger generation immunized without parent‚Äôs consent?
5885,Yeah I calculated it a bit.
5886,Avg Cost of living in China is what 34% the amount to live in America.
5887,Average household income in America estimated to be $61k.
5888,In China it is $12.2k.
5889,So the average income in China is 20% of an Americans.
5890,One difference though is that Chinese save something like 50% of their income - probably for marriage and to buy a home.
5891,Yes people work that long in America but they'll get paid extra.
5892,Yeah it is similar in China and America.
5893,"Building the roads and schools is great, government subsidy for living too."

5897,This will happen regardless.
5898,It's part of the process regardless of variants.
5899,"You get vaccinated, memory cells react and produce antibodies, those antibodies make it really difficult to get infected, those antibodies eventually wane, more and more vaxxed people will get infected, but those memory cells will put in work to prevent severe illness AND clear the virus quickly, reduce viral shedding, and lower the viral load."
5900,This is all part of the game.
5901,COVID will likely turn into a common cold.
5902,"Vaccines are just building that immunity without having to go through your first bout with COVID, which is an amazing achievement for humanity."
5903,"The whole point of a mask mandate is so that they can safely have schooling, though."
5904,No one is pushing for remote schooling.
5905,I don‚Äôt think we have a lot (any?)
5906,data about this yet.
5907,"In fact, the CDC only tracks breakthrough cases that are hospitalized."
5908,"It doesn‚Äôt care about so-called ‚Äúmild‚Äù infections, so it won‚Äôt have data about long-covid from mild breakthroughs."
5909,We will have to depend on other countries or private organizations.
5910,I hope some organization somewhere cares about this anyway.
5911,"The CDC also said today it is considering boosters in relation to severity of breakthrough infection, not infection itself."
5912,"Personally, I plan to watch my own ass  just as I did when the CDC said don‚Äôt wear a mask when it was obvious that the virus was airborne."
5913,"I‚Äôm interested in a booster because I don‚Äôt want to be infected, period."
5914,Exactly.
5915,"And if we want to get through this pandemic, we need to stop begging and coddling sociopaths to work with us, and lock down some counties."

5941,Zoe is showing flat cases for a week.
5942,The North West and Scotland have peaked and the UK as a whole is 3 weeks behind Scotland.

5944,You are right to be cautious.
5945,"My husband and I had both shots and started venturing out unmasked and went on vacation, ate out at restaurants, went to stores, etc."

5958,At this stage people full well know the risks.
5959,If I wasn't fully vaccinated I would not put myself in crowded situations such as nightclubs/sports stadiums.
5960,Now that I'm fully vaccinated I know that even if I catch it symptoms will not likely be anywhere near as severe.
5961,People have choices to make and will have to live with those choices.
5962,If somebody prioritises partying over long term health knowing they're not vaccinated are we meant to feel sorry for them?
5963,Likewise if somebody believes bullshit rumours about vaccines my sympathy levels are going to be minimal.

6022,Hospitalisations and deaths are still going up here in the UK.
6023,"The amount they are going up relative to cases is not  at all like it was in the second wave, but it's still concerning given that we are completely opening up soon and yet vaccines are not fully available for the demographics most responsible for spreading covid now - millennials and gen Z."
6024,Saying the correlation between cases and deaths is broken is not quite right.
6025,"There is still a correlation, it's just a much different ratio."
6026,The problem is that we are opening up fully and can still end up with a really high number of hospitalisations if we aren't careful.

6035,I guess so.

6055,"Also, the reopening coincided with the Euros tournament which created mass gatherings in a country obsessed with football, as people gathered in the reopened bars and clubs en masse to watch Euros."
6056,This created a perfect storm for a new surge
6057,There are other subs devoted to 'open debate' of random opinions about COVID.
6058,How was my comment not fact based?
6059,I stated an observation and a statement from a subject matter expert.
6060,Also how did it not add to the discussion about the post?
6061,There's more comments here that add nothing and are soley opinion based.
6062,I'm fully vaccinated in GA. You couldn't pay me to go grocery shopping without a mask in this state.

6064,What is the most recent data about fully vaccinated who get infected and long covid?
6065,I know several people with breakthrough infections which all got very mild symptoms for about 2-3 days.
6066,"No taste or smell, very mild headache or a runny nose were the symptoms I heard."
6067,They were capable of doing work at home.
6068,"They didn't feel sick, but just 'feeling not 100%'."
6069,"If almost all vulnerable people are vaccinated, sure."
6070,"COVID spread among young, healthy isn‚Äôt that big of a problem."

6072,"What a wonderful day for Canada, and therefore, the world."
6073,"This is so fascinating, kids in America wear masks in school?"
6074,Where I live kids below age 13 have been exempt from any masking during the entire pandemic and afaik we haven't really had any serious issues with them spreading the virus or getting sick.
6075,Hey buddy I'm here with you.
6076,Had the same stressed feeling the past year trying to protect my immunocompromised mom I live with.
6077,"It's been over a year and a bit since I have been in a store or a resteraunt, or anywhere really."
6078,You have to make the choices you'll be able to live with.

6081,"That being said you don't need a gym to get in shape, consider going for a walk or a run, or a hike, somewhere where there isn't a ton of people."

6083,"If the goal is to prevent a heart attack and get in reasonably healthy shape, there are ways around it (albeit inconvenient ones)."
6084,Im 28 and I caught COVID on Saturday and it hasn't been great :( Im double vaccinated and I gave it to a friend of mine who is double vaccinated and is symptomatic.
6085,What I don't really understand is what is actually the point of making people in their 20s get the vaccine?
6086,"If it didnt stop me getting sick nor halt transmission then im a little confused

&amp;#x200B;

People say 'well no hospitalisations' but im 28, the odds of me going to the hospital for covid were incredibly slim either way."

6109,Uh... no.
6110,"&gt; the mRNA technology of PFizer is more targetted, inducing the immune system to recognise a characteristic spike protein of the virus, a ""zoomed in"" view if you like."
6111,Pros - allowed for quicker development of a vaccine.
6112,"Cons: probably less likely to endure than natural immunity, especially in the face of variants

They chose the spike protein because it is likely to be highly conserved through the evolution of variants as it is a requirement to infect a human cell."
6113,"Not for ""faster development of the vaccine""."
6114,"I'm not sure where you got the idea that ""natural immunity"" is ""better"" in the face of the variants, but that sure as hell isn't the data we're seeing."

6258,"Yeah, and don't you hate those types that crap on about world war 2 and fighting for freedom or their ancestors (you know, on those long nonsensical tangents) and it's like don't they think if they'd had vaccines for polio they would have used them?"
6259,I think the state knows that the FDA is going to approve covid vaccines for children 6-11 in mid to late September.
6260,After that the states going to put it's foot down.
6261,You have been contradicting yourself though.
6262,I just seen you say it doesn't protect you but makes you less likely to spread it so wouldn't all the kids wearing them make it harder to be spread around so it would be protecting them.
6263,"If you destroy trust in institutions, and convince people they are smarter than the experts, the door is wide open for any believable lie."
6264,"This is more or less the plan of the Republican and Russian and anti vaxx propagandists who say ""you can only trust us, and can't trust the others because they are greedy liars""."
6265,"They also play to the conceit of people who think they are smart enough to have a medical opinion.... people need to trust the damn experts, all the doctors from all the countries...."
6266,"&gt;Trust the vaccine

That would be immensely easier to do if more of the adult population would get fully vaccinated and if children had the opportunity to be vaccinated as well."
6267,It‚Äôs estimated their vaccines will be approved by September or October.
6268,Waiting until a few months post elementary vaccine eligibility will not hurt any more than it‚Äôs already hurt anyone.

6303,I've taught for over 20 years and I've never been so disappointed in my local community (calling for no masks) and in some of my colleagues.

6305,Very sorry you are one of the few but glad you got that shot because I think it did save your life.
6306,"I read in your comment history that you were hospitalized and nearly died of sepsis and were hospitalized for two months with that, how long ago did that occur?"

6331,It‚Äôs been great not sweating to death around my mouth and nose because it‚Äôs 100 degrees outside and 80 degrees inside buildings (my work has shit AC).
6332,The idea of going back to that is terrible to me and depressing as fuck.
6333,Is wearing a mask the end of the world?

6344,How about we say thank you to masks and social distancing for making in-person school safer for our kids until they ALL have the opportunity to be vaccinated.
6345,Just because you are ok with yours or other people‚Äôs kids being unprotected and probably being ok doesn‚Äôt mean all parents don‚Äôt want to keep their kids from getting this disease if possible.

""Virus curbs to be relaxed amid record infections""

I know we all want to go back to normal, but I think just telling everyone to use honor system (USA,) or mask suggested (UK)  is BS."
6581,"If we (Global) want to really get back to normal, we need to do things like France Require vaccine to work in healthcare and others, like California, masks in schools (until  kids are vaccinated)
Otherwise we are just doing a circle jerk."
6582,I mean... we didn't have vaccines last year and BLM protests looked just like that.
6583,What about Manhattan?
6584,Really?
6585,I've only had the first shot so far but all it did to me was make me sleepy for a day (aside from the sore arm which resolved completely in 3 days and was fairly inconsequential anyway).

6587,I didn't know the poorer communities there had a tougher time with the vaccination sites.
6588,[deleted]
6589,"Right, because no one is encouraging anyone to get the shot..."
6590,I don't necessarily agree with a blanket ruling.
6591,High schoolers can get vaccinated since May.
6592,"If vaccines are effective (they are), then why can't they be maskless?"
6593,Reading faces is almost impossible in masks and you miss a lot of communication
6594,"From what I can see on the tracker, the case numbers are still below 1k, so it's not as high as it could be."
6595,"But yes, the more vaccinations, the better."
6596,It's the only way to beat this virus into the ground and free us of these restrictions.
6597,"The vaccinated ones are safe, but the unvaccinated ones REALLY need to do so now."
6598,I saw 100% of delta spread in unvaccinated homes being reported.
6599,"Maybe with a great deal of care in a larger home you could quarantine, but with 5-10 seconds of exposure being enough to infect someone, that's going to be real hard."

6606,"Not much effort to be honest, just some questions answered and blood drawn."
6607,"Less flu is likely because of less international travel and the fact that it‚Äôs now less acceptable to show up to work, and elsewhere, with symptoms of a respiratory illness."
6608,I wish it would be mandatory if there is no medical valid reason not to get vaccinated.
6609,"A lot of viral evolution occurs when a cell is infected with multiple viruses, allowing recombination to occur."

6629,Just 38% of the total population is fully vaccinated.
6630,They have done great with first doses.
6631,Almost 65% of the population.
6632,"However, first doses are almost insignificant to Delta."
6633,"So, open things up, all the young people go out with very little to no protection and cases skyrocket."

A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test is performed to detect genetic material from a specific organism, such as a virus."

6674,Rural childcare is a fraction of the cost of the cities and anyone who makes under ~$35k in California qualifies for childcare subsidies.
6675,&gt; Wearing a mask is not a major sacrifice.
6676,"It is for a child still developing and learning to socialize, communicate, and understand other humans."
6677,"I know the running joke is that reddit is full of childless autistic introverts... but it needs to be acknowledged that the majority of humans communicate a significant amount of information via facial expressions, and verbal communication involves a significant amount of lip reading."

6697,They're just as much part of the hospitality industry as the big chains and unless you want them all to be swallowed up by said big chains then they need to reopen ASAP.
6698,"You sound like a nasty, bitter person."

6706,All the people that don't want to do their part can just fucking leave the rest of us that did so we can get on with our lives while you deal with the shit we've already done our part for.

6711,Looking historically once we had an effective vaccine for something a search for treatments seems to slow down or end.
6712,"For instance, measles,  mumps, rubella, polio, has any research been done on treatments for these diseases in the last 50 years?"
6713,Not a lot of money and effort seems to get allocated to finding treatments once a vaccine is available.
6714,So it does not surprise me that now there are multiple vaccines for covid that we don't hear much about treatment research.
6715,"Generally speaking, they're not doing that but they made an exception for the essential workers who were vaccinated with AZ way back in March."
6716,You could choose another dose of AZ or switch to Pfizer.
6717,Most people I know went with AZ but I didn't respond well to the first dose so I switched.
6718,"&gt; Even if it's a mild or asymptomatic case, we are seeing long covid cases, neurological issues and changes to grey matter in the brain post covid."

6723,"They all say ""we don't know""."
6724,Could you clarify?
6725,You're comparing a theoretical possibility against an observed reality that post-infection immunity does not last.
6726,Also: it's not like immunizing the population naturally was an acceptable option even if it had worked.
6727,"Doing another vaccine with different targeting is not only an option, it's pretty much expected."

6756,"Thanks, that makes sense."
6757,So ideally we‚Äôd wait until younger people are also vaccinated?
6758,"‚ÄúThe efficacy or the effectiveness in the real world is unquestioned, so we‚Äôre going to get a full approval,‚Äù he added."
6759,"‚ÄúThe question is, it‚Äôs just going to take a little bit more time.‚Äù

Yes, that's the real question."
6760,How much longer do we need to wait?
6761,Do you trust politicians?
6762,Science at this level is unfortunately not without political influence.
6763,"I have a question to you and /u/jim1980abc, if the vaccine does not prevent the disease spreading to other people (like in sinovac's case), would that make it better or worse if a city / country get vaccinated with sinovac and the virus can still spread and mutate?"
6764,"Local epidemiologists are saying that their concern of using vaccines that doesn't prevent spread is that there is a chance long-term there will be vaccine-resistant mutation because the virus can mutate and breakthrough off of Sinovac (while less likely on Moderna, Pfizer, etc)

I just want to know what's you two's take on this."
6765,I think a booster in autumn is a good choice indeed!
6766,Indoor where though?
6767,At the grocery store?
6768,"This will help minimally unless they make people wear them in their houses and stop people from going out to eat and drink, which is obviously not going to happen."
6769,So it‚Äôs all just pointless theater.
6770,"So I'm just using Scotland stats here but I suspect they generalize well across the UK (Scotland's current wave is a little ahead of England's, but England is headed the same direction)."
6771,"While the proportion of cases that lead to hospital admissions and deaths is much lower, if you get enough cases it still becomes a concern."
6772,"Younger people are being hospitalized more than anyone else now, and they're likely to survive, but if cases keep rising it may reach a rate where it puts a lot of pressure on other services."
6773,"That's bad news if you have a cancer scare, or if you get hit by a car and need an ambulance, or if you've been waiting for a hip replacement but the waiting list got absolutely fucked by successive covid waves."

6787,Only way we could fully get to know this damned virus.
6788,It‚Äôs not as if children have the autonomy to just go anywhere they want.
6789,It‚Äôs the responsibility of parents to keep their symptomatic children away from other people.
6790,"If parents keep their sick children at home and isolated from others as much as possible, it will greatly reduce the spread of this virus and many other transmissible illnesses."
6791,It‚Äôs very uncommon for asymptomatic individuals to transmit the virus.
6792,Good luck.
6793,Pfizer presented their data today that indicated the need for a booster and the administration said go pound sand.
6794,"I, like you, will be operating under the assumption we need one until evidence is released saying otherwise."
6795,Deliberate exposure and spreading of infection is always going to be a bad idea.
6796,That‚Äôs why vaccines exist in the first place.
6797,Breakthrough cases are not something we want.
6798,It increases the risk for immunocompromised people and the chance of worrisome mutations.
6799,"The current vaccines seem to have high efficacy for a long time, just not the same level as in the first months."
6800,Variolation-type practices can stay in pre-1800s.
6801,"If a booster is needed, it‚Äôs far superior to just get an actual vaccine booster."
6802,"No, I get it."
6803,Yeah that's really great honestly!!!
6804,Having the vaccine is definitely helping my anxiety!
6805,"I'm glad it's available for everyone, just wish more people would get it heren"
6806,Lol this article is all over Facebook like it‚Äôs the gotcha of the century.
6807,"I didn't get any side effects (Pfizer), and I'm part of a UK government study getting monthly antibody tests."
6808,"After six months of being negative for antibodies, I tested positive three weeks after my vaccination."
6809,"I won't be properly protected from delta until my second dose next week, but it gave me a great sign that my immune system knows what it's doing even though I didn't get any side effects."
6810,"A little good news though: out of 92,000 delta infections in the UK, the count of vaccinated people under 50 who died from it was literally zero."
6811,"For reference we would expect 1.8/100,000 people under 50 to die from the flu."
6812,Exactly right.
6813,You may be misunderstanding what Im saying.
6814,Natural infection also plays a role in herd immunity.
6815,"Not only immunity via vaccination, which the OP was implying."
6816,"As I said, vaccination is the smart route."

6819,Fair enough.
6820,"I tend to think a lot of the people here suffering w long covid, especially breakthrough, are suffering from anxiety and depression or other mental health issues that can cause brain fog after a year+ of lockdown as well as probably reading negative news on this sub all day."

6823,"&gt;work in hospitality

Ah right."
6824,'The Hospitality Industry' have been bloody awful throughout the whole pandemic.
6825,And the bigger the organisation the bigger the two fingers they've been giving to the public.
6826,Sick to the back teeth of their constant bleating.
6827,Well personally I'm never going near anything larger than a family 'hospitality' business ever again and the more of the rest of them that go screaming to the wall from bankruptcy over the next year the better.
6828,They won't be missed.
6829,We certainly don't need a 'Hospitality Industry' that looks anything like what we have at the moment.
6830,It's a blight on society.
6831,The US would always prefer its own companies over foreign pharma - J&amp;J is similar enough to AZ that I seriously doubt you'll ever see the latter in the US.
6832,[removed]
6833,So massive deaths and hospitalizations for years.
6834,Got it.
6835,Vaccination against measles is mandatory in Germany.
6836,Evidently the French strategy of fighting vaccine skepticism by having family doctors phone up their patients didn‚Äôt work.
6837,"People respond to incentives, and the more resistant they are the stronger the need for incentives."
6838,it's important for the US to watch Israel and see how the variants are either spreading or being contained.
6839,Interestingly the article noted that only 60% of their population has gotten their first shot (not fully vaccinated).
6840,"Given that they started their rollout very early in conjunction with Pfizer, I'm wondering which segments of their population are hold-outs."
6841,"I know Ultra-Orthodox Jews are anti-vax, but there must be others too."
6842,"You say UK in your title, but this graph shows data from the US."

6845,No-one really is complaining about public gatherings.
6846,"Around the world, reopening has either happened or is happening in fits and starts."
6847,"Covid's not going away completely, and the world can't stop forever."
6848,It's the teachers unions pushing the narrative that children and schooling is inherently unsafe.
6849,And they're really hit the end here.
6850,We are not going to have another year where an entire generation -- the *next adult generation*  \-- is held in social isolation without schooling.
6851,I think once everyone has the chance/ability to get vaccinated and once we can get a steady flow of functional vaccines out on a consistent basis like we do with the Flu (or if the current vaccines hold) we will start to see more of that mentality happen and more people will move for good.
6852,"Unfortunately with just about every country still having at least one demographic that‚Äôs unable to be vaccinated and new variants putting current vaccine efficacy into question when they gain footing I would say we‚Äôre not quite there yet, but we‚Äôre getting ever so closer and there will be a point where the scenario in your comment will happen"
6853,"Nah, I got a positive COVID test and quarantined for two weeks as per state law."
6854,COVID is asymptomatic or mild for most people.
6855,"Yep, the German government of the 1930s and 40s was well known for identifying Jews and banning them from restaurants, cinemas, and healthcare professionals."
6856,There are even people still alive who remember those great injustices.
6857,I suggest that you ask them to compare their experiences then and now.
6858,Newly double Pfizered in Tokyo.I will keep wearing masks of course.
6859,Hoping my old body makes lots of antibody!
6860,"(Other than real reason I care about,we will be ""looked at"" if we don't wear masks here)"
6861,Before lockdown  and extremely mild.......Then you did not have covid  you had a cold.....
6862,"I'm in San Diego, so just south of LA and I've certaiy seen a lot of reporting on this issue, mainly on the local NPR/PBS channels."
6863,"But of course, those most likely to be diagnosed with Covid these days are probably not likely to be NPR/PBS consumers."
6864,"I agree that even here, wider public outreach on the issue has been poor."
6865,"Some California districts are doing in-person-only schooling for Fall, and this is very much in demand in the rural areas."
6866,And for good reason.
6867,"Incomes are much lower in rural areas, and for a year and a half, 6 million school kids have been home often without any adult supervision."

6876,That can be debated by scientist smarter than me.
6877,"I would tend to agree with you on the risk assessment, but we need to have as few anti Vaccine as possible in the same time."
6878,What is certain is that at least Sweden chose this route and we have soon vaccinated 70% of all adults and we are stil mostly limited by the supply of the vaccine.
6879,Hopefully we can reach 80% of adults beeing vaccinated.
6880,Which would be decent compared to the rest of the world.
6881,"As California public schools mostly remained completely closed, beyond some spring 2021 in-person classes for the very youngest students, it sounds like they're forcing the issue to make more parents opt out of the public school system -- both for students and parents not wanting to continue the mask rules that no longer apply to adults, and for nervous parents who will read ""masks still required"" as reason to keep their children at home."
6882,Public education does seem to be coming to a rapid end.
6883,[removed]
6884,&gt; I prefer the term smarter than you
6885,[deleted]
6886,From what I understand you‚Äôll spread it less but only because being vaccinated makes you less likely to develop the symptoms that help spread it e.g.
6887,"coughs and sneezes

If you manage to test positive and share a joint with someone they‚Äôll probably still get it"
6888,12% of the UK population is just over 8m people.
6889,That's 8m people far less likely to get severe disease and if the assumption is that they reduce or completely eliminate their ability to transmit that will make a difference too.
6890,Infections will rise there's no doubt about that but let's be honest the UK has had no restrictions in all but name since May 17th anyway.
6891,I totally forgot about children- that‚Äôs an excellent point.
6892,"That‚Äôs a large segment of the population that is unvaccinated through no fault of their own, so hopefully things move quickly once it‚Äôs approved for them."
6893,"Seems kinda reasonable (devils in the details, always)."
6894,We ll see after a year of 2.
6895,"Maybe your gov knows whats its doing, they did well for a time."
6896,"No-fpp2/3 masks don't work either way, and barely anyone is using them in EU or US"
6897,"Come to Missouri, we‚Äôll shake that feeling right out if you!"
6898,We're not in Kansas anymore!
6899,(Which was high on the list of suspected places the Spanish Flu actually started.)
6900,Difficult not to worry when you could be one of the unlucky few.
6901,Also long term repercussions of a mild illness are not fully understood - given that long covid even in mild covid cases can be debilitating there‚Äôs reason to be concerned.
6902,Now as far as i can remember you are correct.
6903,"I believe the requirement to wear a mask was to stop you from spreading your infection, not prevent you from catching it."
6904,"I'm not from the US so i don't know precisely, still, I don't think that the change will happen from one day to another, it will probably be a gradual thing."
6905,"As of right now, children under 12 cannot be vaccinated, and they constitute more or less 10/15% of the US population, which is kind of a lot."
6906,"It means that there's still a big chunk of people that didn't have the possibility to get vaccinated, so i don't think this change will happen in the next month or so."
6907,"Once it gets approved for everybody tho and the amount of vaccinations returns to stagnate some time after that (like now), you'll be pretty much done with the people that you'll be able to vaccinate in a useful amount of time."
6908,The question then is how many people can be convinced in the hesitant group and how can it happen.
6909,"That will probably be painfully slow and hard tho, so you will probably see the amount of vaccinated slowly creep up until who knows where."
6910,Pfizer said that they are studying the vaccine in children and that we'll probably have some results by September/October.
6911,"So, to answer your question, if studies show it's safe and effective, maybe by nov/dec?"
6912,Early 2022?
6913,Around that time imo.
6914,For some context her doctor license already revoked and she literally have mental issue.
6915,But somehow many people trust her
6916,And I believe the bood clots with those vaccines are less prevalent than what women have to deal with using anticonception pills.
6917,We live in the age of disinformation.
6918,‚ÄúAn infected person can spread COVID-19 starting from 48 hours (or 2 days) before the person has any symptoms or tests positive for COVID-19.
6919,"A person is still considered a close contact even if they were wearing a mask while they were around someone with COVID-19.‚Äù

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/contact-tracing.html"
6920,It‚Äôs a bit of a one-two punch.
6921,"Hardcore anti-vax people will probably also not wear masks, which will spread the virus even more than if they were anti-vax but still wore masks."
6922,‚ÄúAn infected person can spread COVID-19 starting from 48 hours (or 2 days) before the person has any symptoms or tests positive for COVID-19.

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/contact-tracing.html"
6924,The problem in the United States are the strict rules regarding masks that have been in place outdoors.
6925,Lots of other countries only mandated masks for indoor environments (as outdoor infection risk is extremely small) and that's a reasonable choice that has been accepted by most of the population and which is a viable long-term solution.
6926,"Meanwhile lots of states in the US have been extremely strict and also enforced mask usage outdoors, which is a real PITA if you want to exercise outdoors or otherwise spend long stretches of time outdoors."
6927,I'm not surprised that so many people are opposed to masks.
6928,I've been curious on the severity of precautions taken by those though who are asymptomatic and what effect it has on the likelihood of spreading.
6929,Probably not something they are focusing on at the moment but would be neat to see the difference.

6962,I've always been pro masks and pro lockdowns etc as much as I don't enjoy any of those things but the entire point of all that was to get the vaccines so we can continue on living.
6963,We have them now and when they are accessible to everyone but everyone does not take them it's no longer my responsibility for them.
6964,It was my responsibility when covid was running rampant and no one had any protection.
6965,We have it now.. is it perfect?

6974,I guess no one knows how the share of vaccinated people will influence this directly.
6975,Isn‚Äôt anyone modeling this ?
6976,"The vast majority of vaccinated Californians have received Pfizer or Moderna though, while in the UK the majority have been jabbed with Astra-Zenica."

6981,Are you fatigued too?

6986,Still could turn into one.
6987,Americans for you.
6988,I don't think that is correct.
6989,There is typically a period of 1-2 days between becoming contagious and developing symptoms.
6990,"But in that period you will (nearly always, at least with the better tests) test positive, provided the test is administered properly."
6991,"The risk with testing is that one is infected but not quite contagious at the time of testing, and becomes contagious between the test and the event one is being tested for."
6992,Plus of course there will be a few false negatives.
6993,Spain is not requiring tests or vaccinations to enter the country.
6994,They also opened the clubs so you can imagine how that works.
6995,Some regions now have to go into lockdown again because they fucked up so hard.
6996,"Really, someone suggesting basically that Americans who brag about forging vaccine cards and breaking mask rules might have done it is American exceptionalism?"
6997,"""95% less likely to have symptomatic infection"" is exactly what you would get if ""the vaccine works 95% of times""."
6998,"So it could very well be partly this, i.e."
6999,some of the breakthroughs are because the vaccine didn't work for some people.
7000,"However, this binary ""works 95% of times"" vs. doesn't work at all 5% of the time is not the only way you would get the reduction in infection rate."
7001,It could e.g.
7002,"shift the severeness so some survive instead of dying, some have a mild disease instead of a severe one, some don't get it at all instead of being asymptomatic."
7003,This could have essentially the same effect at the population level.
7004,In the case being discussed that would mean hospitalization instead of death if the vaccine's effect is the latter (shifting the curve) or it would mean no change at all vs. unvaccinated if the vaccine simply did not work for them at all.
7005,"I would expect a mix of both effects, i.e."
7006,the vaccines mostly reduce severeness but for some people they just don't take.
7007,"What's your take u/84JPG, apart from ""you're all wrong""?"
7008,"Yeah, let's let a disease that causes long-term brain damage, heart damage, and lung damage have a free run at kids!"

7010,There's a sad case of a young boy who caught the original virus the next town over from me.
7011,"He was hit hard with long Covid, particularly the brain fog."
7012,I'm very anxious about the Delta version.
7013,"By that logic, they would be wearing them forever, or at least perennially."
7014,"Assuming they‚Äôre even particularly effective, over-sterilizing a young persons environment has consequences too."
7015,That is the age you need the kind of germ exposure you get in schools.
7016,Bruh covid causes long-term brain damage
7017,Got any source on that R0 = 8?
7018,"It sounds really high given that ""vanilla""/D614G COVID19 is assumed to have R0 \~= 2.5 (for reference flu has \~1.2, H1N1 pandemic 2009 swine flu \~1.4)

Also as Israel is reporting currently, large amounts of fully vaccinated people do contract (mild) Delta anyway."
7019,I know my mask is staying the hell on and people the hell away despite being fully vaccinated.
7020,"Oh wow, I didn‚Äôt know you could mix them."
7021,I also got Pfizer and am really happy about it.
7022,"We endured 15 straight months of anxiety and fear without a tangible, visible threat to mentally cope with, it's expected."

7025,Read that article again.
7026,"Hundreds and thousands of healthcare workers were fully vaccinated, and only hundreds of them got infected."
7027,Even fewer were hospitalized.
7028,"The US makes you carry a credential to buy alcohol or even psuedoephedrine‚Ä¶ its not unprecedented, at least France is doing something to push its vaccine % up‚Ä¶ the US has just sputtered out around 60%."

7040,"Surgical masks filter 50-70% of droplets, double layer cotton filters 20-50%."

7066,"&gt;Of the new locally transmitted infections, five were¬†linked to previous cases and were already quarantined,¬†while 10 were linked to previous cases and were detected through surveillance."
7067,"&gt;Four cases are currently unlinked,¬†the Ministry of Health (MOH) said in its preliminary daily update."

7071,"There was also criticism of a more centralised ""socialistic"" govt and healthcare system, which was equally absurd."
7072,"The few that did get hospitalised enjoyed publicly funded top quality healthcare while those in the US had to sell their homes, lose their jobs and go bankrupt."

7131,And me my mam and niece are all in the clear.
7132,So the vaccines do work and stop the spread of the virus.
7133,"Immunity dissipates over time, everyone would have to essentially keep getting infected at the same time for that to be achieved, it not as effective at preventing future infections compared to vaccines, not to mention like before the problems associated with getting infected with the actual virus."
7134,"I responded that way because my comment never implied that vaccines are the only way to achieve immunity, it was to explain why 50% is still not enough, so im not sure why it was needed, it seemed like he had an agenda, maybe I read that wrong."
7135,I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre talking about secondary schools.
7136,But I agree it would still be smart at this point for universities also to invest in upgrading their HVAC.
7137,"Vaccines are held to a much, much higher standard than things like birth control pills (which have *major* side effects)."
7138,Vaccines are pretty much universally safer than the vast majority of pharmaceuticals you take or buy (over the counter or prescription).
7139,"The standard for vaccine safety is incredibly high because they are given to healthy people, whereas (presumably) other drugs are taken as a therapeutic or cure to an existing illness."
7140,"While it's a bit of a red herring as acetaminophen (tylenol / paracetamol) would never be approved as over the counter under today's drug approval regime, more than 250 people in the US die painful and excruciating deaths from liver failure each year from unintentional acetaminophen overdoses (and ignores the hundreds of more that would have died without liver transplants)."
7141,Dozens of other over the counter drugs have serious potentially fatal side effects that kill people each year.
7142,Birth control is way worse than any vaccine in terms of side effects - both long and short term - and risk of death - either from clots or from increased risk of cancer.
7143,"But it is ""therapeutic"" in the sense that the risk of death from birth control is *far* less than the risk of death from pregnancy and - obviously - the societal benefits of women having more control of their reproductive decisions."
7144,"But still, the birth control pill is a terrible reference point *because* it has massive side effects and comparatively high death risk (short and long term) compared to vaccines."
7145,You know they have vaccines for that now right?
7146,"If you are using Sinovac, based on the Chile study just published, 1 dose Sinovac provides very little protection (15% effectiveness or something), after 2 doses you get 66%ish effectiveness), which is kind of similar to AZ's effectiveness."
7147,So only fully vaccination rate matters for Sinovac and 26.6% is probably too low to see a dramatic change.
7148,"Chile finally saw a dramatic drop of cases in the past few weeks, I think after they hit 50% fully vaccinated at that time."
7149,"Orlando, FL mayor just told everyone to wear a mask inside."

7158,The smallpox vaccination was mandatory in West Germany until 1976 and a bit longer in East Germany.
7159,I think a lot of other countries in the world were also very strict.
7160,And nowadays smallpox is eradicated.
7161,"If some decades ago all kinds of people around the world would have refused the smallpox vaccination because of ""Basic Human Rights"", we likely would have this deadly disease still around."
7162,Sometimes it feels people get more idiotic with time and not smarter.
7163,It wouldn't surprise me if there are more anti-vaxxers in the western world today than 50 years ago.
7164,Isn't the same for the unvaccinated healthy people?
7165,"You know they can spread it and take it home to their families, right?"

7170,It doesn‚Äôt seem anything to be joyful about honestly..
7171,Look you clearly feel strongly about this and want to argue.
7172,You‚Äôre cherry-picking my comments to make your point.
7173,My point is simply that by and large children under 12 did not wear masks during class hours in much of Europe.
7174,The US has been very mask heavy (Canada as well for that matter) and encouraged the use of masks in much younger kids.
7175,This is a difference in policy.
7176,And if you‚Äôre interested you can read more about the danish policy for masks in schools here.

7189,&gt; I mean ema has to ensure covidshield is same as AZ first?
7190,The WHO has already done that.
7191,And I'm not saying EMA should suddenly make Covishield an approved vaccine for use in Europe.
7192,"But it seems a bit weird when Covishield vaccinated people can travel freely to Germany, but in France they're considered unvaccinated."

7194,The things they are pushing back on are the very things that would take us to normal.
7195,Every coronavirus briefing under trump .com
7196,Because 90% of seniors have been vaccinated and in previous waves that made up over 80% of deaths.
7197,In this wave we'd expect the death ceiling to be much much lower.
7198,Do you have data on how many people a haveong covid.

7200,"The accusations are pretty absurd, Moderna has exactly one product on the market right now - the Covid19 vaccine."

7214,"Thai scientists have been dissapointing recently - from the ""Sinovac doesn't work vs Delta"" ""study"" of 10 samples  published in Facebook to this."
7215,Wonder if they are paid to prop up AZ because there is a local company that manufactures these vaccines.
7216,Yeah that's Queens.
7217,Some how I'm not surprised to see Howard Beach on the list of highest positivity rates.
7218,"I'm not a conservative or even particularly anti-mask, and I don't know what the health status is of those around you, but in general I don't believe making kids wear masks when they're in an extremely low risk category is right."
7219,Maybe.

7222,Honest question.
7223,"If governments are shifting to the idea that it‚Äôs ok to get mild covid, then why should the healthy‚Äîthose already at low risk‚Äîfeel pressed to get vaccinated?"

7256,The Health Ministry said it would allow mixing the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine with the one produced by Pfizer/BioNTech should there be limited vaccine supply.
7257,"In a decision issued by deputy minister of health Truong Quoc Cuong on the ministry's distribution plan for the incoming 745,000 Pfizer vaccine doses purchased using the national budget, the ministry said those who have been given their first Covid-19 vaccine shot by AstraZeneca would be prioritized to receive their second shot with the Pfizer vaccine about 8-12 weeks after the first shot."
7258,The decision would only be applicable if the ones to be vaccinated consent to it.
7259,"For those who have yet to receive any Covid-19 vaccine shot, the Pfizer one would be prioritized for use as well, according to the decision."
7260,"While the Pfizer vaccine doses would be distributed to all 63 localities of Vietnam, most of them would end up in HCMC, Hanoi, Binh Duong and Dong Nai, which are either major cities or experiencing severe Covid-19 outbreaks."
7261,Binh Duong and Dong Nai Provinces bordering HCMC are among the country's biggest industrial hubs.
7262,"HCMC in particular would receive around 55,000 doses, Hanoi 38,000, and the southern Binh Duong and Dong Nai 25,000 each."
7263,"Most other localities would receive around 5,850 doses each."
7264,"Among the 745,000 Pfizer vaccine doses to be received, Vietnam has only received over 97,000 so far."
7265,"The rest would arrive within this month, though their exact dates have yet to be confirmed."
7266,"It is the first time Vietnam allows mixing different types of Covid-19 vaccines through multiple shots, though the decision has already been observed in several countries around the world."
7267,Thailand for example said on Tuesday it would provide its people their third shots of Covid-19 vaccine by AstraZeneca following two shots by China's Sinovac after it recorded coronavirus infections even on fully vaccinated individuals with the Sinovac vaccine.
7268,"German chancellor Angela Merkel received her second Covid-19 vaccine shot by Moderna in June, two months after she received her first shot by AstraZeneca."
7269,"However, the WHO on Monday advised against people mixing and matching Covid-19 vaccines from different manufacturers, calling it a ""dangerous trend"" since there was little data available about the health impact, Reuters reported."

7277,*
7278,Exactly what I said: older kids have worn masks.
7279,"I should have been specific since the discussion was on younger kids specifically, eg."
7280,The population that can‚Äôt be vaccinated.
7281,I'm not saying it's not possible; what I'm getting at is that it's not likely to significantly improve in areas where it's still not so good.
7282,Vaccines are widely available in the US and people have already made their choice.
7283,The bad areas are still bad because those people have made the choice to not get vaccinated.
7284,I don't see that changing in another year.
7285,"Normally, yeah, but that Delta variation sounds like it's still making it harder to really tell since it just mixes in with all other variants unless they specifically test for it."
7286,"I don't know too much about it, specifically, other than data generally showing that rates of infection have gone way down for those who are vaccinated (at least for the main variant)."
7287,I don't think we have definitive evidence that natural immunity would be impossible to achieve eventually.
7288,Can you link to the evidence?
7289,My interpretation was that the virus is still new enough that experts don't know what the status will be in a decade or two or five.
7290,I was mostly responding to your comment because your reply seemed like the commentator was advocating for a natural immunity approach when they've said over and over that the only smart approach is through vaccination.
7291,You responded like they are anti-vax when they clearly aren't.
7292,"Edit: and we do know that many people who have been infected with COVID-19 have immunity for some time afterward, which does contribute to herd immunity."
7293,I don‚Äôt think his reasoning is necessarily backwards.
7294,Vaccinating one person in a less vaccinated area does more to prevent others from getting the virus because they could potentially infect many others.
7295,So even if a vaccinated person getting COVID makes new strains more likely this could effectively cancel out when you consider how many more people will be infected if you used a booster on someone who has already been vaccinated instead of giving a vaccine in a lower vaxxed area.
7296,I would love for mandates to never have been used and everyone listen to the experts that say to wear masks and that masks work.
7297,Unfortunately in the us we had a president who had to politicize basic pandemic survival tips so mandates became necessary.
7298,"Many factories in Saigon Hi-tech Park, including the Samsung Electronics CE Complex, have shut down after more than 750 Covid-19 cases were confirmed there."
7299,"Starting Tuesday, the Samsung Electronics CE Complex has granted over 7,000 workers time off for the company to set up accommodation within the factory."
7300,Precision manufacturer Nidec Vietnam has been shut for nearly a week after some employees tested positive for the novel coronavirus.
7301,"The company now has over 4,000 workers living within the premises unable to leave for their homes during the shutdown, and 150 are accommodated in hotels near the park."
7302,"Other Nidec companies like Nidec Servo and Nidec Copal with a total of nearly 4,000 employees are now operating one shift a day with the number of workers down by 35 percent."

7466,You might be in a good area and I might not be or vice versa.
7467,"In any case, we'll be wondering and discussing this for another year or two or more."
7468,I think the 1918 pandemic lasted for four years as it circled the planet to infect and reinfect areas again and again before it all just faded away.
7469,"There are at least two reasons why they might have this policy, and they're both about protecting other people:

 1) You don't want people waiting in line to get vaccinated to catch covid from other people in line with them."
7470,"2) Someone who has recovered from covid has some amount of protection from natural immunity, while someone who has never been exposed doesn't; if vaccines are in short supply, asking those who have recovered to wait to receive their vaccines will allow more people to be protected sooner."
7471,I think some countries (France?)
7472,have a policy that people who have recovered only need one dose of a two dose vaccine (which also lets more people be protected for a given quantity of vaccine); there are research findings that are consistent with this showing covid recovery + 1 dose produces higher antibody levels than 2 doses of vaccine.

7479,The are now not going to require temp checks or health attestations for students in building.

7481,"Our district told us our ventilation system was great, the last week of school they told us our ventilation system was not up to code so it would be redone."
7482,They forced teachers and students to go back to a school that did not have a ventilation system up to code and no windows that opened.
7483,"But if it does get approved, and it shouldn't have...

Then that would be a million times worse."
7484,That‚Äôs exactly the problem and what makes us rely on these retrospective studies.
7485,All of these are obviously prevaccine so we really won‚Äôt know how asymptomatic and mild cases actually affect physiology in vaccinated people or for how long.

7546,You‚Äôre only going to hear the account of a loud minority of idiots who had a bad time.
7547,Thank you that‚Äôs what I was looking for.
7548,It‚Äôs quite tragic that people accept misinformation and don‚Äôt vaccinate themselves when it‚Äôs possible to avoids this.
7549,That is a good point t that I didn't even mention - the possible added protection regarding severity even if you do get infected.
7550,I'm sorry to hear that you can't smell anything though.
7551,I wouldn't like that at all if it happened to me.
7552,I hope you get that important sense back soon.

7561,They won't be bringing them to the vaccinated.
7562,Dying of covid is almost entirely a choice at this point.
7563,No one 12 and up can complain at this point.
7564,Time for the vaccinated families to move on with their lives.
7565,We didn't stay home for a very bad flu.
7566,"We stayed home for a novel, deadly virus for which there was no vaccine."
7567,Judges regardless of the country seem to be pretty punitive when someone decides to just completely ignore a court summons.
7568,Similarly there has been at least one case of mask refusal and judges also don't like people disrespecting the safety guidelines of their own court room and the mask refuser got a contempt of court charge and hauled off to jail.
7569,Because I live in an area with so many vaxed adults that the risk of covid even getting into camp is absurdly low.
7570,Kids still mask indoors as an FYI.
7571,I am not stupid.
7572,I am just pointing out that the north east is not going to see some crazy covid explosion.
7573,It sounds like a good case of ‚Äúthis policy sounds good on paper.‚Äù But clearly not for those who have to actually try and enforce it.
7574,The issue is that the only people willing to mask are the people who got vaccinated and those people masking indoors will not help mitigate the transmission of the virus on a public health level because they are not the vectors of disease transmission
7575,When has Macron been against vaccines?
7576,"He had a few remarks against AstraZeneca, but I don't remember anything against vaccines in general."
7577,Nah mate if hospitals are flooded with unvaccinated idiots that means that the whole society needs to lock down because you can't afford to take minor risks anymore.
7578,"If you have an open wound fracture, you'll still get an er room, but if the would starts to infect and go septic you need an icu bed."
7579,US citizens have a Constitutional right to travel about the United States and I don't think a passport restricting that right would pass Constitutional muster.
7580,No.
7581,They just vote in politicians that repeatedly remove tough regulations from the car companies.
7582,"Like, face it dude."
7583,People have assessed the risk of not driving with a seatbelt and driving with one and have made the decision that it's worth the risk and minimal discomfort.
7584,Mask-wearing is much more invasive than wearing a seatbelt.
7585,You are literally covering half of your face.
7586,It makes recognizing someone near impossible.
7587,A lot of people are getting acne and other skin irritation from wearing them so often.
7588,Many can't do strenuous activity in them.
7589,People who work with the general public have to wear them for hours on end and enforce them on others to great risk of their lives and mental health.
7590,Just because you only have to wear one to pick up your Uber Eats order doesn't mean that others are as lucky and find them to be NBD.
7591,Do you happen to have a search engine handy?
7592,Seems like maybe you‚Äôre about 4-6 months behind on developments.
7593,Vaccine makers started applying for full FDA approval in **May/June**.

There is no delay or need for concern."
7596,The vaccines that are available today weren‚Äôt all approved for emergency use at the same time.
7597,"They didn‚Äôt all apply at the same time, either."
7598,&gt; There are two ways to get a vaccine greenlighted by the FDA: with an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) or by applying for a license through a Biologics License Application (BLA).
7599,"&gt; ‚ÄúThe only difference really between the emergency use and the licensure is that volunteers are observed for a longer period of time to see the duration of protection, and if there might be rare adverse events that occurred down the road,"" Dr. Schaffner said."
7600,"&gt; In layman's terms, Dr. Monto said, that follow-up period after complete vaccination is typically longer when considering full licensure."
7601,"&gt; ""After the clinical trials are finished, the difference between the Emergency Use Authorization and full licensure, for the public's information or knowledge, is basically the duration of follow-up or safety, not efficacy,"" Dr. Monto said."
7602,"""Efficacy requirements are the same."""
7603,"&gt; For the EUA, it's an average of two months, but for a license, six months are required, Dr. Monto explained."
7604,&gt; A spokesperson for the FDA backed that up and said they usually expect manufacturers to provide data from study participants from at least six months after vaccination when applying for a license.
7605,"&gt; So, between an EUA and a license, an EUA was the quicker option to get the vaccines out to save lives."
7606,"Think of it as the fast-tracked version, rather than the standard one."
7607,"&gt; EUAs only come into play if the secretary of Health and Human Services deems them necessary, and they're generally temporary, as opposed to licensure."

7666,I used this example to highlight the idiocy behind it.
7667,"There are a lot of youtube videos of these idiots sticking what they think are items like aluminum cans or even utensils made of aluminum (camping fork) in one example not realizing if they have become magneto, it wouldn't work that well on that type of metal."
7668,"So yeah, the vaccine-induced magnetism works differently on all metals to some of these inbreds."
7669,Even metals that contain little to no iron.
7670,Same for our family in California.
7671,More kids die from gang violence every year than covid BEFORE the vaccine.
7672,Should we lock up all young black men to prevent those deaths?
7673,It would surely save hundreds.
7674,My own breathing got easier just reading this to the end.
7675,"It is already dropping again, but slowly"
7676,"Yes, but literally every parent I know, excluding me and my husband, have their kids in camps, large playgroups, at the store, etc, with no masks or distancing."
7677,They‚Äôre not even trying to keep them safe until the vaccine is available
7678,"Yes, every single Catholic who ever lived was in on the residential schools, which were an independent venture spearheaded by the Vatican, and totally was not led by the Canadian government and Canadian churches... almost as if it's a Canadian colonialist problem and not ""le religion""..."
7679,This is just wrong.
7680,"The free test centers in Germany are doing rapid antibodies test and hand out confirmation documents, paper and digital, that is valid for traveling and accepted almost worldwide."
7681,"PCR tests are done too as second confirmation or when you are hospitalized, and they are also free."
7682,"Just the 2‚Ç¨ self-made test kits from the drugstore don‚Äôt proof anything because they are not personalized, not dated, and can be easily faked with a secret fluid called Dihydrogenmonoxid."
7683,I am not forcing anyone to get vaccinated.
7684,That is their personal decision.
7685,I do not want to force some woman to carry a baby to term or get an abortion either.
7686,It is there body.
7687,Suddenly the pro-choice crowd is anti-choice.
7688,It is not my business.
7689,I am vaccinated.
7690,I am still wearing a mask and will continue to wear a mask in the future.
7691,No reason to breath in what the mouth breathers on the far left or right are spewing out.

7693,I had an old classmate a few years older than me about that age and almost same thing except he pulled out of it.
7694,So scary to see a healthy mid thirties person feel slightly sick then a day later can't breath with double pneumonia caused by covid.
7695,"Sooner are later there are likely going to be, and I wouldn't chance it."
7696,I really don't care what you think of my argument.
7697,"Some People are already saying ‚ÄúNot even FDA Approval is enough to prove it‚Äôs safe, just look at *insert drug that had problems in the past*‚Äù."
7698,"Like ok, do these people not trust modern medicine anymore?"
7699,I get that.
7700,"I‚Äôve just assumed the risks to be very high for my son, even before the delta variant."
7701,"I‚Äôm admittedly a paranoid person in regards to his health and safety, so statistics don‚Äôt comfort me."
7702,Especially with a virus they‚Äôre constantly learning about and still don‚Äôt know so much.
7703,"So even if I read an article that said all but one of these kids were 17, I would still be just as worried about my 9 year old."
7704,"I‚Äôve never felt like ‚Äúoh most kids are fine, no big deal‚Äù, because there ARE some kids who get severely ill, get MIS-C, die, etc."
7705,"and I would never forgive myself if my son was one of them, when there are things I can do to prevent it."
7706,All very good points.
7707,I wish you the best possible in this pandemic journey :)
7708,"What I‚Äôm getting at is that if they can make you wear an article of clothing, they can also enforce a mask."
7709,"With how low their vaccination rate is, should we really be surprised?"
7710,This is where I always get mixed on the FDA.
7711,They have a track record of approving drugs with practically no significant improvements but a laundry list of side effects.
7712,"[https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20150706.049097/full/](https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20150706.049097/full/)

Institutional Corruption is one of the likely causes, e.g."
7713,"just like how pharm companies effectively bribe doctors into tossing pills into people's mouths, pharm companies also grease FDA officials to get things approved."
7714,That‚Äôs not comparable proof at all.
7715,First you didn‚Äôt link any actual source so‚Ä¶ Also HIV is a very different disease both in symptoms and means of transmission.
7716,Not to mention that combining drugs to create a satisfactorily effective initial treatment is different from needing boosters with a much more effective initial treatment.
7717,Again this absolutely COULD be the case with COVID as well but unless there is something else you haven‚Äôt shown me we are the furthest thing from knowing that to be the case.
7718,That's ridiculous when we expect other countries to recognise our program.
7719,I hope it is just an issue of working out the details/bureaucratic nonsense of how to accept proof of vaccination from an external system.
7720,"Eg Malta initially didn't accept the UK digital NHS app as proof of vaccination, but then shortly did around a week later, I assume because they found a way they were satisfied with to verify it."
7721,"It can't be that hard to just accept the EU digital covid certificate, so fingers crossed this gets sorted out sooner rather than later."
7722,"From a financial perspective it's much more interesting for the government to allow people to visit than allow brits to leave (tourism money in vs tourism money being spent elsewhere), so you would have thought it in their best interests to get it fixed."
7723,I don‚Äôt think you can lump the normal ‚Äùanti vaxxers‚Äù together with people who are skeptical of the Covid vaccine.
7724,I've been in VA and FL and it's like night and day.
7725,"&gt; Fiscus is at least the 25th official to leave **A** state‚Äôs top vaccination position since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic...

Of the 50 US States, at least 25 people in an equivalent position as hers has quit or retired."
7726,Not 25 in just Tennessee.
7727,"""Hospitalizations are down 24 percent in the same time period, while deaths are in the low single digits..."""
7728,"Is that 43,960 accumulated over the weekend, and just reported on one day, or is it actually the number of new cases for a single day?"
7729,"Assuming you are in the US also, we're in WAY better shape than last year due to the vaccines."
7730,"That said, the case curve to watch right now is the UK."
7731,We are sort of in a similar boat as far as vaccination rates go (though we have probably more cases/natural immunity on top the of vaccination rate).
7732,Delta is just a lot more transmissible.
7733,"Unvaccinated people and kids may get a significant number of cases, plus there may be a significant number of breakthrough cases for vaccinated people (which will in most cases be very mild)."
7734,"Luckily it seems that the UK has a pretty low mortality rate during this surge, this is the effect of their high vaccination rate of elderly."
7735,The US also will hopefully be similar.
7736,"Considering they're removing all Covid restrictions on July 19, I think they've concluded that it doesn't."
7737,This is such a lovely positive take on what sounds like such a shitty year.
7738,"I really hope you feel much better very soon, that your job continues to make you happy, and that the next year is less eventful for you."
7739,Basically yes.
7740,To reduce the chance of resistances in HIV patients several drugs are combined.
7741,The same thing is done in Tuberculosis.
7742,Due to their tendency to resistances you start with a combination of 4 different antibiotics.
7743,"But that is not happening and won't happen because 70-80% are freely deciding to be vaccinated, so sorry, but that is not the case, hospital are not flooded with covid cases."
7744,"You do realise there‚Äôs a very slim chance of dying or even being hospitalised, right?"
7745,Deaths lag

7747,"Not me, that would frankly be racist to give anti-vaxers there a pass."
7748,I'm not sure what being a dictatorship has to do with it.
7749,Jacobson v Massachusetts is still precedent in America and many people would argue that America is not a dictatorship.
7750,That makes sense.

7752,"My 9 year old is high risk, so we‚Äôve been extremely careful this entire time."
7753,"I‚Äôve never seen it as him just getting the flu (which honestly even if I did, his asthma makes the flu a really dangerous thing)."

7797,"I know that ineffective vaccines can increase new strains, I‚Äôm not contesting that."

What are you basing that on?"
7808,A few anecdotes on Reddit?
7809,"There are four, five good studies out now showing the vaccines to be very effective against Delta."
7810,"You're going to see negative anecdotes no matter what, simply because there are billions of people in the world."
7811,Some people won't like it but I'm going to say it: if you're vaccinated then let it go.
7812,Live your life.
7813,Don't worry about the case count.

7861,With the different Vaccines available those at risk(Autoimmune for example) can find a Vaccine that works for them.
7862,The mNRA ones for example show no risk for those with Autoimmune  diseases.
7863,Nobody who has a medically valid reason not to get vaccinated(extremely low percentage of population) should be excluded from anything.
7864,The chances are they will likely want to protect themselves and say work remotely.
7865,Any other reason is simply a choice and they should be barred from the return to normal since they are choosing not to participate in the solution.
7866,I've been wearing mine despite being vaccinated.

7876,"Also the spanish flu- people took it even more seriously when it mutated, causing a second wave that was especially dangerous for the young."
7877,It was likely spread due to troop movements during the war.
7878,No they actually don't know.
7879,All this information for distribution is vague at best.
7880,Hence the shit planning.
7881,I wouldn't expect someone with no knowledge in the field to understand so I'm done here.
7882,The test for active infection is NOT the antibody test -- otherwise nearly everyone who got sick would remain positive for a very long time.
7883,"Instead it's a PCR test, which looks for snippets of RNA that match the exact sequence of Covid's RNA (it's an RNA virus)."
7884,"Basically, only people actively fighting off an infection test positive on a PCR test."
7885,Antigen test is another one that looks for active infection by looking for viral proteins.
7886,If your symptoms went away then you will probably soon test negative on a PCR test (or maybe already would test negative if you took the test today).
7887,"They're actually ending some COVID vaccine clinics for adults because they don't want to be seen as advocating vaccines for adolescents:

&gt; [The health department] ended events on school property ‚Äúout of an abundance of caution‚Äù because vaccination efforts were ‚Äúperceived by some to give the wrong impression regarding parental consent.‚Äù

Why this might be a problem:

&gt; This shift is worrisome to Brian Haile, the CEO of Neighborhood Health, a group of nonprofit clinics providing vaccines in and around Nashville."
7888,"&gt; In many rural Tennessee counties, school gymnasiums are one of the few venues large enough to hold a vaccination event indoors, with air conditioning, with enough space for social distancing, Haile said."
7889,The cases will never get to 100k daily cases in the US again.
7890,"We'll see some sporadic regional  stuff, like Missouri (think Michigan in April)."
7891,"You have to watch how the government acts, not what they say."
7892,"They might be warning about Delta, but they are also shutting down vaccination centers and testing centers all over the place."
7893,The pandemic phase in the United States is over.
7894,"I agree, but we also need to manage the fact that people have given a year of their life up foe this disease already."
7895,"Of the population, I would break it down into 3 groups: vaccinated, anti-vaxxers, and those who don‚Äôt get the vaccine for a legitimate reason (be it medical, legitimate fears about it, no access for some reason, etc.)"
7896,"You‚Äôre not going to change the anti-vaxxers minds easily, and in the US, I just don‚Äôt see any sort of vaccine passport getting large scale acceptance."
7897,And those who can‚Äôt get the vaccine for a rational reason are a small group.
7898,I don‚Äôt think we can continue to lock down the whole country because of a large group of ignorant people who won‚Äôt change their minds.
7899,I‚Äôve been advocating for a while that any unvaccinated people (who don‚Äôt have a legitimate reason) be placed at the bottom of the medical priority list for any COVID related treatment.
7900,I‚Äôm not saying we flat out refuse to treat them.
7901,"But if you‚Äôre community has an outbreak and the hospitals fill, and you catch COVID and need a ventilator, but someone else needs that same ventilator who just had a car crash or whatever, too bad for you if you‚Äôre unvaccinated."
7902,"We should allow people to make their own decisions, but don‚Äôt let those decisions impact our health care system."
7903,We just simply don‚Äôt allow them to shut down ICU wards or use needed ventilators if they made the decision to not get vaccinated.
7904,"They knew the risks, don‚Äôt let their decision impact someone else who did get vaccinated."
7905,no way it wont happen.
7906,and it'll be worse.
7907,because they'll be inside more.
7908,"i cant see anything else happen

its like when texas re-opened the bars up like a week after the shut down ended."
7909,what will happen?
7910,texas being one of the worst places in the world for a while.
7911,im not sending my kid into that.
7912,thankfully ive been a full time stay at home parent his whole life so we dont have to adjust.
7913,and hes only 4 so hes just missing out on preschool and he knows all that stuff anyway.
7914,it'd be mostly for social reasons
7915,"Not great, not terrible."
7916,"I would have expected the infection numbers to be higher today, but they weren't."
7917,"If the number is lower tomorrow as well, then this wave will come crashing down almost as fast as it soared."
7918,The administration asking for more data on the need for a booster is a perfectly valid request.
7919,Because without a doubt Pfizer and the rest of the vaccine makers would love to have a nice constant income stream thanks to annual boosters forever.
7920,Whatever some within the administration believe or their motives.
7921,"At the end of the day, we need good data to show if boosters are needed."
7922,And when exactly they are needed.
7923,"Every six months, every year, every 2 years?"
7924,To me those are all yet to be properly answered based on actual data.
7925,So I'm all for the govt asking for more data and more studies to truly figure out the need and timing of this.

7945,"If you look in other groups, they think that if anything, the situation is being downplayed."
7946,"(Not saying I agree, but the idea is floating around there and as with anything, you can make a case for it)."

7953,Haven‚Äôt missed a day of work this entire pandemic.
7954,Was knee deep in customers when Arizona had the worse infection rate in the entire world.
7955,"I followed the rules, stayed distant, always wore a mask around people, and never got the virus."
7956,Masks and distancing really do work.
7957,I‚Äôm fully vaccinated and happily wear a mask around people.
7958,Also not taking chances bringing this home to my little ones.
7959,These vaccines aren't that expensive.
7960,"The cost is peanuts compared to their benefits, economically."
7961,But why are you assuming that boosters are more valuable than new vaccinations when we can‚Äôt know either.
7962,I agree that it is a very difficult and important decision we have to make with limited information.
7963,That‚Äôs why it is even more important that we try to know as much as we can and not just act on gut feelings or intuitions.
7964,"100 cases of GBS out of 12.8 million doses given, and 99 of those cases made a full recovery."
7965,So 1 death out of 12.8 million - 0.000008% chance of death.
7966,That is what I think is called fighting odds.
7967,Wrong.
7968,Check my history.
7969,"Among the stupidity, you'll find plenty of comments from me telling vaccinated people to take off their masks and get back to living their lives."
7970,No one is insisting that we stay inside forever.
7971,"I don't understand people on Reddit who create straw man arguments to attack, but here we are."
7972,"I simply believe in facts and science, and I allow them to be my guide."

8001,"Again besides the difficulty to do it without being caught, and it'd be supid for a public listed pharmaceutical company like Fosun do to so (why don't Pfizer sabotage vaccines shipped to Cuba or Vietnam?)"
8002,"Let's look at the gain and loss:
Gain: Taiwan would have more deaths, mostly elderly and weak."
8003,Make no much difference during the war.
8004,Besides Taiwan has other kinds of vaccines.
8005,Loss: the data would be suspicious and western countries would make sure China's reputation damaged.
8006,The gain just doesn't justify the loss.
8007,"Actually, if you think about it, US has quite some motivation to sabotage this batch of vaccine distributed by China."
8008,And they have a lot of chance to do so in Taiwan.
8009,Cases don't matter when we have vaccines and deaths remain very low.
8010,I genuinely feel bad to see what's playing out in Australia right now.
8011,You guys along with NZ did such a great job at embracing zero covid and making it work; but then your government essentially threw it away by trying to lowball Pfizer.

8071,What sort of environmentalist propaganda have you been listening to that makes you think billions of people are going to die in the near future?

8078,We're looking at 90% of adults jabbed.
8079,Children are not being jabbed because the JCVI thinks that the danger to them from vaccines is greater than that from covid.

8088,Cases are on the rise.
8089,Los Angeles County is up 150% over last week.
8090,Israel wmt from almost no cases to 427 new cases yesterday.
8091,"Yeah I‚Äôm talking total vaccines, but the UK has just slightly less than Canada."
8092,Both are amazing.
8093,I hope you find time to follow the link OP helpfully posted.
8094,It will be faster than googling ... litterally one click.
8095,.
8096,"You are also in for a big surprise, the data has admissions, ICU usage etc."
8097,"So far it supports the UK-style argument that the nexus between cases and serious illness is broken, although we have to see how it develops, we should wait another week, but if people want to draw conclusions on the data now, you have to conclude there is cause for optimism."
8098,"Aww, thank you."
8099,Does it matter?
8100,I think they‚Äôre downvoting you for not getting tested

8110,The problem is people don't actually do wear a mask.
8111,"In the UK you can remove your mask if eating or drinking, so most people use a coffee as an excuse to not wear it throughout the whole flight."
8112,Just a few days ago a Ryanair employee got pissed at me because she told me move along the line and be stuck to another group and I refused saying I wanted to keep my 1m distance (noting that I was the last in line so where I stood made no difference).
8113,She then went to talk to a group of completly unmasked people and all super polite to them.
8114,If you're in NWA there's also a nasty RSV going around.
8115,"If China had partial control over the logistics, then it could sabotage some vaccines in some vaccine shipments to Taiwan."
8116,Rendering vacccines useless would suffice.
8117,"When the original ""opening up"" proposals were set out, they were done so according to government models and projections."
8118,"At the press conference today it was announced that we are ""about in line"" with the median case estimate; *but* are on the lower end of projections for mortality."
8119,"In other words, although the numbers are getting larger, we're still broadly in a better position than was expected when these proposals were given the thumbs up."
8120,That gives room for cautious optimism.
8121,Even Neil Ferguson agrees.
8122,"&gt; The cynic will say that this is coming a little late, but it is what it is."
8123,I really don't think it's reasonable to expect a country to prioritize citizens of other nation's above their own citizens with regards to vaccines.
8124,Obviously once a country has more than enough vaccines for their own people then helping other countries get vaccinated is a great thing to do but I wouldn't blame Canada at all for waiting until now to do that.
8125,There are people living there who can't get vaccinated... Maybe wait until folks under 12 can get the vaccine before saying fuck everyone.
8126,So is Spain lying about the cases in their country?
8127,Cries in Nevadan
8128,I‚Äôm your neighbor to the south in bama and we are fully encircled by knuckle dragging plague buckets.
8129,Well munich is a bit different than Spain...

8131,"I hope, but there are still a big unknown because of the delta variant."
8132,It seems from a guardian article that they are already seeing hospitalization going up fast and talking about 100 000 cases per day and  1000 hospitalization per day.

8136,Maybe?
8137,They are also going to require that Nursing home staff get  vaccinated immediately.
8138,It's amazing to me that this hasn't already been done since 41% of the population has been vaxxed.
8139,Certainly wishing them the best.
8140,"Well, there was ONE case, where contact tracing proved they‚Äôd had only been next to each other for roughly 10 seconds: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/williamhaseltine/2021/06/28/infection-through-fleeting-contact-with-the-delta-variant-leads-to-lockdowns-across-australia/amp/"
8141,But damn does he work slowly.
8142,"Fully vaccinated but immune compromised with a child under 12, haha fuck me right."
8143,People who are willfully unvaccinated are no longer my concern.
8144,It depends on your age.
8145,"It could be Pfizer, Moderna, J&amp;J or AstraZeneca."
8146,I got AZ first and then I chose Pfizer for my second dose.
8147,To be fair the rabies vaccine acts like that.
8148,You take it as soon as possible after exposure.
8149,"I didn‚Äôt mean why rethink it, I meant why go to Arkansas?"
8150,"I would argue this is in the same vein as ""There is no evidence of human to human transmission""."

8152,[removed]
8153,"As a US physician, should have been mandatory 6 months ago."
8154,We have the same rules in Portugal.
8155,A big problem is that basically no one under 50 has been completely vaccinated (our certificate is only valid 14 days after the second dose) and PCR tests are not free (unless you have symptoms or had contact with someone infected with COVID).
8156,"Based on your post history, you live in Canada."
8157,"If this is your level of risk tolerance, you must also never drive cars, go swimming, or eat red meat."
8158,"In fact, do you ever leave your house?"
8159,I bet there's a reason for this that's inexorably intertwined with the pandemic but can't be discussed here.
8160,[deleted]
8161,Good!
8162,How many vaccinated?
8163,Have you not considered the freedom to not wash your hands... or something.
8164,I have no idea why this always gets downvoted.
8165,"Everyone tries to say screw the unvaccinated, but then when someone points out a large population that can‚Äôt get vaccinated, suddenly it‚Äôs an invalid argument?"
8166,And please don‚Äôt with the whole ‚Äúthey only get mild symptoms‚Äù.
8167,"We absolutely do not know the long term effects of covid on kids - adults with mild cases have been found to have all sorts of inflammatory issues after the fact, not to mention grey matter loss associated with the classic ‚Äúmild‚Äù loss of taste and smell."
8168,"And that‚Äôs just mild cases, not taking into account the very serious MISC that can occur in kids, or the rising number of juvenile hospitalizations associated with delta."
8169,So I just don‚Äôt understand why kids don‚Äôt count.
8170,I'm more concerned about neurological issues and gray matter changes long term that they are seeing with even mild and asymptomatic cases.
8171,"Currently 42% of France either ""will not"" get a vaccine or is hesitant."
8172,(https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations#attitudes-to-covid-19-vaccinations)
8173,"Yes, there were few checkbox, but neither was about liability, I checked https://myturn.ca.gov/ again and I don't see anything."
8174,"As someone pointed out there's already a federal law for any vaccinations (not just covid), so I'm guessing it was just Rite Aid covering their back."
8175,Agree completely.
8176,way too much Pearl clutching here.
8177,If you arent vaccinated that's on you and your own decision to attend that.
8178,If you are you will almost certainly be fine in a big open air stadium.

8189,"&gt;Read about what is going on in Israel, where they vaccinated people with Pfizer."
8190,"A decent number of fully vaccinated people are contracting COVID (vaccine is only 64% effective in preventing transmission based on new data), and a lot of these people received the vaccine in January, which could indicate the immunity from the vaccine starts to drop after 6 months."
8191,You should be suspicious of these numbers.
8192,It wasn't even a study.
8193,The sample size was very small.
8194,"We don't know if they were counting asymptomatic individuals, etc."
8195,"Also, every other report from other countries has shown efficacy in the high 80's to low 90's."
8196,"We had numerous peaceful yet crowded protests as well as outright riots in the US last year, none of which seem to have driven infections as far as I was able to discern."
8197,Fingers crossed this incident dodges a bullet too.
8198,I was able to get past with incognito.
8199,"I‚Äôve also been looking for good sources recording breakthrough infections and transmissions, if you find any."
8200,"&gt;In addition to the more than 100 reported coronavirus deaths in June, Marylanders who haven‚Äôt gotten inoculated made up 95 percent of the 2,385 new coronavirus cases and 93 percent of the 6,707 new coronavirus hospitalizations the state saw that month."
8201,"&gt;‚Ä¶From May 10 to June 8, unvaccinated people made up 89 percent of new hospitalizations and 97 percent of new infections in Maryland, Schrader told a legislative panel last month."
8202,I'm disappointed.

8204,What if a lottery ticket that was given out in NJ was a big winner?
8205,"Yeah, americans annoyed at us celebrating getting to the Euros final has drawn alot of anti England comments in recent weeks"
8206,Depends heavily on the country.
8207,Belgium is actually a front runner in Europe with all adults offered at least a first shot by now (with over 80% taking it) and moving on to 12-18 year olds now (although only Pfizer is currently approved for that age group).
8208,The problem is obviously that these youth party vacations took the non-vaccinated to a country with clubs open and no one decently testing or imposing Covid measures.
8209,It was always going to go wrong quickly and these couple of hundred Belgian kids will only be a fraction of the problem.
8210,Interesting my coworker came down with full blown symptoms the last weekend and has both Pfizer vaccines on board.
8211,She can‚Äôt smell or taste.
8212,Got second dose in February.
8213,I‚Äôm curious as to what causes these breakthroughs.
8214,I‚Äôm impressed your son had the courage to mask.
8215,Much better said than I did
8216,I doubt that they'll deliberately sabotage their own vaccines.
8217,What's gain for them?
8218,Anyway bioNTech is made by German.
8219,A CEV Mate of mine was 100% asymptomatic and only picked up on an antibody test while getting ready to go into hospital.
8220,PCRs through that time we're clear.
8221,Another mate hasn't had an antibody test but I'm convinced he has had it.
8222,His Mrs was covid positive and they were isolating together.
8223,From a few days in he took an LFT every day as part of a test to release trial - every test was negative.
8224,How many of these people are unvaccinated?..
8225,Good getting tired of anti vaxx anti mask morons.
8226,We need to do this is US to.
8227,This is very bad.
8228,People shouldn't be trying to go directly to the kids.
8229,"We HAVE to leave the decision to the parents, for good and bad."
8230,I can see why she was fired.
8231,"That was extremely inappropriate, no matter how good her intentions."
8232,"If my kid was eligible for vaccination, I would do it in a heartbeat; but I would be livid if anyone just went and did it without my authorisation."
8233,My wife also has huge concerns and I have to talk her through these things.
8234,She'd freak the F out if authorities just went over our heads.
8235,I got mines back in March.
8236,I‚Äôm still standing strong.

8238,They simply don't want to set a precedent of bodily autonomy at such a young age.
8239,"If they do that, they might get other bright ideas, like that abortions might be a thing worth doing like this too."
8240,Diligence has already been cracked.
8241,"In the past month, there's has been a woman openly flaunt ""there is no pandemic, so I'm not wearing mask""."
8242,"More recently, a man openly not wear mask and go out for exercise (though his original plan is to piss off the police, based on the video), and a company's workers rushed out of their factory because of muxk-up in communications and they dont want to be isolated/quarantined."
8243,"Hell, this morning, I even see a video of 2 brats disobey the request to stop and check for ""passing"" paper (detailing that you need to go out and work) from the police."
8244,Thank you for saving me the time.
8245,So you mean it‚Äôs 5%*the risk of getting infected with Covid if you‚Äôre not vaccinated?
8246,She was fired for getting people vaccinated.

8270,"&gt;	‚ÄúAlthough all were vaccinated, we want to acknowledge our colleagues recognized their own symptoms (similar to allergies or the common cold) and chose to get tested,‚Äù he said."
8271,"‚ÄúThere were no exposures to our patients as our staff complies with all PPE (personal protective equipment) guidelines, masking at all times and wearing face shields with all patient encounters.‚Äù"
8272,If all the athletes and staff have been given the chance to vaccinate then it‚Äôs fine.
8273,"If enough people get vaccinated, masks won't be necessary."
8274,"Immunocompromised people will carry on as they did before, taking their own precautions."
8275,"In an ideal world we could get the danger back down to the baseline, normal level."
8276,That‚Äôs exactly what we did once she started having symptoms.

8278,"WHO (and by extension, UN) lacks any real power."

8280,Yes.
8281,"This report, based on real world British vaccine data against the delta variant, shows high efficacy against hospitalisation but low against infection after 1 dose."

8285,The CDC has directed medical professionals to not test a vaccinated individual for covid unless they have symptoms.

8338,&gt;	Two other employees who were infected had received one dose of a double-dose vaccination.

8690,They would just send whatever they had out to the vaccine clinics when first doses were going out.
8691,"I would have to imagine it would be very difficult to coordinate doing the same order out for second doses, and making getting a vaccine hard might breed hesitancy."
8692,"I think regardless of what the WHO says, when these decisions to mix were being made the science seemed to support that it shouldn't matter all that much and may even be better to mix to MRNA vaccines."

8708,It's no coincidence that the more highly educated areas of the US are also the ones with the high vaccination rates.

8776,I don't know who to believe any more tbh the WHO seems to go back and forth on things ..but I already got em mixed so hoping all goes well.
8777,You can't  assume natural immunity is waning just because some people get COVID who have been vaccinated.
8778,No vaccine is perfect and their case is likely mild.
8779,"Yes the immunity is likely to wane at some point, but studies have shown continued strong resistance.... we are still at something like 99% of all deaths and ICU admissions being unvaccinated.... doesn't mean you can't get sick though, you definitely can get sick."

8856,It‚Äôs not that simple tho.
8857,I have a 4 month old son who can‚Äôt get vaccinated.
8858,"My wife and I are fully vaccinated and would love to go out and enjoy things, with or without our son, but we can‚Äôt because the risk of him contracting the virus is still too great in certain settings."
8859,"My entire state is only 30% vaccinated, yet it is wide open."
8860,"A lot of places here have a rule that vaccinated people can enter without a mask, but there is no verification required... and nobody is wearing a mask so simple math shows a lot of people are lying to avoid wearing a mask."
8861,It‚Äôs a lose-lose for us if we want to do everything in our power to keep our son safe.
8862,I fully expect cases to soar here by the end of summer but our governor never supported safety protocols so who knows what will happen but I doubt we would go back to masks being required.
8863,"It was in the news a while ago, but it's not exactly common."
8864,The vast majority of people I know are planning on staying here for the summer.
8865,They're still around?
8866,That's why I said pretty much.
8867,"They didn't exactly place additional orders, but some of the poorer countries decided not to buy Pfizer which meant others took up their allocation."

8869,No real world results yet.
8870,"I would not be super concerned, however."
8871,"J&amp;J's efficacy against original COVID was 72%, and against the Beta (B.1.351/South Africa) variant was &gt;60%."
8872,Beta seems to have a greater degree of immune escape than Delta.
8873,I would guess J&amp;J is thus somewhere in the 60% effective range against Beta.
8874,Its the peoples fault for doing what is allowed?
8875,Its the goverments fault for opening literally everything in a span of two weeks instead of gradually opening things again.
8876,An idiot could have seen this coming.
8877,"My point is, and I thought it was obvious, so this was not a baiting situation, is that J&amp;J repeatedly gets worse press than the mRNAs."
8878,I did not receive multiple notifications from multiple news sources about the mydocarditis seen in the other vax and yet somehow my phone blows up anytime someone breathes J&amp;J's company name.
8879,"If what's going on isn't totally obvious by now, idk what is."
8880,It could still make sense to develop e.g.
8881,delta specific boosters.

8899,There‚Äôs also the fact that now is summer and having a wave now is better than delaying it into winter.
8900,Scientists have modelled the data and found that now is best as schools are about to break up for the holidays and the warmer weather results in people having windows open and improving ventilation.
8901,This is not what you originally wrote.

9055,Is wherever you‚Äôre going using them to check if you‚Äôre truly vaccinated?
9056,"Even then, the nucleocapsid test seems out of left field (unless that‚Äôs to check for people vaccinated with one of the inactivated virus vaccines)?"
9057,Seems like quite the strange situation regardless.
9058,Is this for a destination within a destination (ie the antibody tests are for an event or something in the county you‚Äôre traveling to?).

9100,"There are so many variables you can change which alter PCR efficiency of any type (conventional, real-time, droplet digital, etc.)"
9101,Plus positive controls are often fairly strong/middle of the road positives so they aren't gonna reflect if you have a weakly positive sample that's on the edge.
9102,"The bacteria I work with is still very diagnostically challenging so we operate under the notion that a PCR can tell you ""yes"" but it can't tell you ""no"" if that makes sense."

9137,"There has never been anything to stop these companies from hiring software engineers from outside metropolitan markets or off-shoring before Covid, so why does this suddenly matter now?"
9138,"In fact companies are paying millions of dollars for office space, then paying the overhead of furnishing those spaces, stocking them, managing them, and the utility bills and insurance policies to cover those locations."
9139,"This entire time they could have saved massive amounts of money by explicitly not having offices in those major cities, but they opened those offices because the idea was that those were the hot places to prop up their businesses to attract talent and business."
9140,The cycle was then created that software engineers had to move to those cities to land such jobs.
9141,And the housing prices and costs of living rose upward as a consequence of this.
9142,It's an ever ballooning race upwards.
9143,"One could argue that the salaries of employees are slightly inflated due to costs of living in certain markets, but skills have a value."
9144,If you're working for a company at their office in Manhattan or from home in rural/suburban areas shouldn't make a difference - if you have the skills to produce the value the company needs and the company is making the same profit margins and meeting their fiscal plans ... you've earned your value.
9145,There was a major push to off-shore software engineering jobs in the late 90s and early 00s and suddenly those jobs came pouring back home.
9146,Why?
9147,"Because suddenly companies realized the talent pool wasn't there, the projects were failing to meet deadlines, failing to complete at all, the quality dropped, security issues became a concern."
9148,The folks from those markets who were skilled enough recognized their value and charged what they were worth.

9167,1/ Guess what though.
9168,There are elderly people in society and they go out among folk who are unmasked.
9169,Many of the elderly people are also unmasked.
9170,The CDC has said in the US that folk don't need to wear masks places if you are vaccinated.
9171,I don't see what your argument here has to do with schools since those elderly teachers will be exposed to the same risks everywhere else.
9172,2/ Show data that shows enough dangerously bad outcomes for teenagers that everyone has to change their behavior.
9173,Oh and you're commenting on health policy on my state.

9192,Why care when you are fully vaccinated?
9193,"Yes, only for people 41 years or older BUT with an option for younger people to subscribe voluntarily to take those (and many did, especially J&amp;J since it‚Äôs one shot only)."
9194,i wish..... supplies for everything were so scarce early pandemic but once we could at least get n95 equivalents locally that is what i told friends and family.
9195,Because I live by a bunch of dumb fucks that won't vaccinate.
9196,The first week was severe.
9197,I woke up at 2am holding onto the mattress because it felt like I was being flipped.
9198,I did a telehealth visit.
9199,They said if I felt I needed to be seen in person that I needed to call an ambulance.

9205,Thanks for asking.
9206,Are you curious because you have a similar experience?
9207,FYI.
9208,It can take up to 2 weeks after infection for antibody tests to detect anything.

9216,Are the three most conservative provinces of Canada shaping up to be the lowest vaccinated?

9219,Reading this the day before i get the j&amp;j vaccine is not ideal.
9220,Alright.

9232,And here I sit teaching in Texas where it is illegal to even ask them to put a mask on in the classroom.
9233,I thought NY was one of the areas who were eager for vaccination since they (along with NJ) were very much educated about COVID from the start considering what they went through.

9248,"Yes, vaccines still effective not sure why we need to mask up"
9249,"Yea I agree, that's what it would seem logically at least."

9264,My dad had A variant of GBS the MF variant and he is fully vaccinated.
9265,Doesn‚Äôt seem to be an issue from those that had GBS.
9266,This should come as no surprise if you‚Äôve been following the ways they‚Äôve tried handling covid.
9267,"Kids are very low risk, less than from influenza, and are at much greater risk of dying in something like a car wreck."
9268,Immunocompromised individuals can continue to take extreme precautions like masking and distancing.
9269,It's their bad luck that they pulled a shit card from the deck and not mine.
9270,"I am not in that situation, and I'm done."
9271,I did my part.
9272,"I masked and I distanced for over a year, I jumped in line to get my shots at the first opportunity (got my first dose literally a day after my group became eligible)."
9273,"For healthy people like me who were always low risk, who followed the rules, and who did their civic duty and got vaccinated, the war is over."
9274,"I will not be masking, or distancing, or missing out on a social event ever again due to a disease that was never going to give me anything worse than a nasty cold anyway."
9275,Because the minute one person died from a vaccine no one would take it.
9276,Hard enough to get these stupid ass people to even wear masks.

9282,"I don‚Äôt wish it on anyone but I wish they named the disease in these headlines, it would still get clicks because most people don‚Äôt know what GBS is a d knowing the symptoms can save you a lifetime of problems."

9298,Incredibly dangerous game for the immunosuppressed.
9299,Most of us produced significantly fewer antibodies and a significant percentage didn't produce any at all.
9300,"Aw, thanks!"
9301,"I was back in my home country for few months and news about Sweden were a bit distant :) Things seem to be going very well with vaccinations now though, which is great!"
9302,Let's hope we can weather out the Delta variant without a lot of casualties.
9303,"I havent found any information on whether the vaccines prevent long covid if you still end up infected symptomatically, only that if you've been suffering from long covid it can ""cure"" that in 50% of cases... Any info on whether fully vaccinated individuals still have to fear long covid?"
9304,Is it still that 10% of mild infections amongst fully vaccinated develop long covid?
9305,"If you take a look at some of the countries purchasing sinovac, the contract price is confidential and cannot be divulged."
9306,It turns out sinovac is even more expensive than Pfizer.
9307,Lol.
9308,Where do you think the difference goes.
9309,This pandemic has provided huge opportunities for kickbacks among several governments in SEA.
9310,"It's so simple, any government will just decide what vaccine to get without any bidding."
9311,And Chinese companies are well known for bribes.
9312,Before lockdown you had state laws regarding covid?
9313,What country?
9314,"We shit the bed here in US, we certainly didn‚Äôt have state laws about covid before lockdown."
9315,Seemed to be one after the other not too long but most certainly not before.

9319,They don't have money generally
9320,Hi fellow Georgian!
9321,"Yeah, we're less than 40% vaccinated as a state so I just assume 70% of the people I'm around aren't vaccinated, at all times."
9322,Delta is going to go through us like wildfire when everyone goes back inside all the time.
9323,[removed]
9324,"Finally, brains."
9325,I mean most people who got normal COVID were mild to asymptomatic.
9326,It's come out in recent months there were a lot of positive tests in my work place no one knew about because no one actually took off work because of it.
9327,"Doesn't mean we should be hedging our bets on just being fine, because the next person you pass it to may not be asymptomatic, and it might kill them, you can never know."
9328,Fully vaccinated can still die from the virus.
9329,The person ahead of you in line at the grocery store might be an organ transplant patient or your co-worker in the cubicle next to you in the office may be on immunosuppressive medications.
9330,Many people with disabilities can look 100% normal and often lived relatively normal lives pre-pandemic.
9331,We would appreciate not be written off into the category that had it coming to them.
9332,Always remember that a significant portion of our most vulnerable are highly vaccinated at this point.

9424,France and some other EU countries just imposed strict measures that may be successful.
9425,Starting by mandating all health care + health facility workers get vaccinated would help.

9438,The vaccine has been available for awhile and uptake has been pretty low.
9439,It‚Äôs a bit baffling to me.
9440,Vaccinations seem to be highly protective against long COVID; every single study on long COVID has only included unvaccinated people.
9441,"Furthermore, protecting against infection is already possible with the vaccines and it's never been touted as being able to stop literally every single case of COVID, next to no vaccine works that well."
9442,"People aren't going to think about how well the protection works because, unless you know you were exposed to COVID, how would you know?"
9443,A lot of people are not ready to come to terms with the fact that COVID is here to stay.
9444,Sounds like an anti vaxer to me.
9445,"Also, f\* anyone around you that can't get the vaccine due to medical condition or age, huh?"

9658,"Smallpox was a much worse disease than Covid19, with a lethality of 30% and leaving horrible scars, so there was a much stronger argument for making it mandatory."
9659,Also back in those times society was in general much more authoritarian.
9660,It's one of those cases where discretion is important.
9661,"I don't think the severity of Covid19 would justify mandatory vaccination, especially not in Germany as the willingness is pretty high here, and there are negative side-effects of making it mandatory as well."

9668,From a patient perspective it definitely is but it seems quite unfair for someone that studied (and spend a lot of money) to become a health worker to lose their job just because they are required to take the vaccine.
9669,It's not like they have a choice that allows them to get compensation to change professions and compensate for lost income.
9670,Two years ago it would definitely be controversial that the government could mandate you to take vaccines or else lose your job.
9671,While I'm pro jab's I do think that the health workers that don't want a jab and lose their jobs as a consequence need to be compensated for the many years lost because of this surprise mandate.

Brief Summary:

This is a Phase 1/2/3, randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blind, dose-finding, vaccine candidate-selection, and efficacy study in healthy individuals."
9677,The study consists of 2 parts: Phase 1: to identify preferred vaccine candidate(s) and dose level(s); Phase 2/3: an expanded cohort and efficacy part.
9678,"**The study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 3 different SARS-CoV-2 RNA vaccine candidates against COVID-19 and the efficacy of 1 candidate:**

As a 2-dose (separated by 21 days) schedule;

At various different dose levels in Phase 1;

As a booster;

In 3 age groups (Phase 1: 18 to 55 years of age, 65 to 85 years of age; Phase 2/3: ‚â•12 years of age [stratified as 12-15, 16-55 or &gt;55 years of age])."

9761,If you just let Covid run rampant through the unvaccinated population without restrictions as a vaccinated person you *unavoidably* will be exposed at which point your only protection is the imperfect protection you get from the vaccine.
9762,"The reason that only a very small percentage of fully vaccinated people have been hospitalized is that it's a very short timeframe that there even are any fully vaccinated people that count for this statistic, and during that timeframe most of them would not have gotten Covid even without a vaccine."
9763,"Over a longer timeframe and without any other protection everybody who *can* get Covid *will* get Covid, and this includes (probably) most unvaccinated people and multiple percentage points of the vaccinated, which means millions of fully vaccinated people who get the disease of which hundreds of thousands end up badly."
9764,"It's simply not true that restrictions are only about protecting the unvaccinated, though those are obviously the main beneficiaries."

10026,What the WHO meant was that people should listen to health officials and not just pick and choose which vaccine they want.
10027,I would think it's only really a problem in countries where they don't track which vaccine you've already had very well.
10028,You realize the CDC is not just for science but also public policy right?
10029,Their rules are a combo of both.
10030,They failed miserably on the public policy aspect.
10031,The reality is that half our country is basically insane and believe nothing that is real.
10032,The CDC are not dealing with  that unfortunate reality when they are creating these policies.
10033,And btw- delta is a problem for those of us vaccinated.
10034,So they didn‚Äôt even follow the fucking science on this one.
10035,I think that it is vitally important that we understand just how much risk there is of passing it to others after vaccination.
10036,Especially with the increased infectivity in these new variances.
10037,"This whole ""Because of this slightly related verified metric, in theory we only have to worry about the best case scenario"" thought process driving policy is getting really old at this point."
10038,"It cost thousands of lives when it was ""the virus is probably not airborne, masks are not necessary"" it caused millions of disabilities when it was ""The main concern is mortality which is exceedingly rare among those who are young and healthy"" and it is now causing millions more infections with ""Children are probably not a substantial driving force for viral spread, masks are not needed in the coming school year"" and ""There is little risk of those who are vaccinated having severe symptoms and little risk of passing the disease to others, masks and social distancing are not needed for those who are vaccinated."""

10053,It's very easy to do this because it is in everything.
10054,"Here's a list of common over the counter drugs that include Tylenol in at least some of their formulations (not including all the off-brand equivalents):

It's very easy to imagine scenarios where you take multiple of these."
10055,You have a cold/fever so you grab Tylenol for the fever and Sudafed PE for the cold.
10056,"You also are having period cramps, so you grab some Midol."
10057,One of your symptoms is headache for which you always take Excedrin.
10058,You frequently have allergies and you're not sure if it's a cold or allergies so you decide to grab some Benadryl that you regularly take as well.
10059,"And when it's time for bed, you grab the Nyquil in addition to topping off your Midol, Sudafed, and Tylenol."
10060,"Boom, you're easily at 5X recommended dose depending on how frequently you took them."
10061,"Sounds crazy when written out, but it's very easy to do this, especially at different times during the day as you experience different symptoms."
10062,"There's also the issue that addictive opioids include it (basically at government request to make it ""harder"" to abuse them and end up with a lower Schedule classification) so many folks end up overdosing on these drugs in order to get their ever-escalating opioid fix."
10063,But this is a slightly separate issue.
10064,I wonder if that is the case here tbh as the number of people present when we went for our second dose was so low.
10065,There was no queue at all and not because it was so efficient but just because there was hardly anyone there.
10066,I counted just 35 in the waiting area post shot.
10067,Will be interesting to see what the drop off numbers end up being.
10068,I know a lot of people in my area that stuck it out with remote learning in the public schools but were done with it by the end of the year and are now moving to private schools even though mask mandates are probably not going to be in place.
10069,If the school districts in CA are maintaining a mask policy it could be enough to motivate people who were on the fence about staying public to switch.

10075,I was cautious last year and into the time where my wife and I could get the vaccine.
10076,I‚Äôm done now both sides have politicized this for the sole purpose of driving us into a populist hellhole.
10077,This will never end in a manner that pleases the far reaches of either spectrum.
10078,No government local or federal has a viable solution to life‚Äôs work that has been tossed in the trash last year that were small businesses.
10079,Once final approvals come in there will be a second wave of those who choose to get vaccinated and that is the very best that we can expect.

Vaccine does not prevent deaths, new delta strain is less lethal by nature, simple as that."

10097,"Well, that's just part and parcel of American's failed response."
10098,South Korea has high availability and usage of KN95 masks and they've controlled the pandemic far better than the US.

10109,"It definitely looks like we're working from different statistics :)

I was basing myself on a summary from a study on vaccine results in Israel."
10110,I seem to remember that it only took into account people who had been vaccinated for at least 3 months (or was it 6?
10111,I don't remember).
10112,I'll try and find it.
10113,"&gt;Actually,   
&gt;  
&gt;only 0.003% of fully vaccinated people were hospitalized with Covid in the US  
&gt;  
&gt; (I can't find any data for France, likely since it has been too rare to detect otherwise the media would be in a frenzy over it)."
10114,Interesting point.
10115,"The raw(er) data you point to doesn't seem to take into account time, e.g."
10116,"if you vaccinate someone, they're unlikely to fall sick within 7 days, but then everybody is unlikely to fall sick within 7 arbitrarily chosen days."
10117,I'll need to find the study whose summary I had read before continuing this conversation.

10191,Masks have become a security blanket with no thought towards the end game and that's not going to get us 'done' any quicker.
10192,What data?
10193,No one knows if the vaccine *prevents* long covid in people who experienced a mild infection.
10194,"And the CDC doesn‚Äôt care about mild breakthroughs, so unless some other country or organization is studying this, we won‚Äôt know."
10195,There seems to be some myth that the vaccine cures long covid.
10196,"*Some* long covid sufferers experience some relief, but it isn‚Äôt a cure."

10354,There‚Äôs a lot of talk about how ‚Äúeasy‚Äù and seamless it would be to make and distribute a variant booster.
10355,"And yeah it wouldn‚Äôt be horrifically difficult, but nothing would be easier than continuing to churn out the same formulations, and would remove the potential confusion that a different formulation might introduce to the equation, so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs likely we‚Äôll see them anytime in the near future."

10449,Yup basically same thoughts here.
10450,I got my vax as soon as I could and hate that we (in the US) have so many idiots who won't get it.
10451,But I don't believe that unvaccinated people should be essentially barred from participating in society.
10452,I just do not believe the government should have this power.

10455,Why wait for it to become a problem?
10456,"It's the same vaccine, and supply is not an issue at all."
10457,We have an excess of supply based on demand.
10458,Why not allow people to get a booster after 6 months?
10459,careful with this knowledge.

10476,Its full potential is still bound by the mechanisms with which it binds to our cells.
10477,Based on what I remember Scott G. saying is that there is basically a limit to how fit the virus can get.
10478,Correct me if I'm wrong.
10479,The reason the average age was getting lower is because older groups started getting vaccinated which essentially removed them from the hospitalized demographic.
10480,"Go look at the UK right now, cases went from 2k/day to 33k/day."
10481,Deaths went from 10 to 30 and hospitalizations are still relatively flat.

10526,If you would like to remain in ignorance no problem.
10527,But don‚Äôt drag other people down with you.
10528,People are literally on here every day sharing first hand experiences of the variants in countries with varying levels of vaccination uptake.
10529,The data literally shows the number of deaths and the severity of the Delta virus hitting India.
10530,At the time India was doing well enough to be donating vaccines to other countries.
10531,And then in a very short space of time their healthcare systems were overwhelmed.
10532,There is video out there.
10533,Go look for it.
10534,I can tell you from personal experience that the Gamma/P1 variant hit my country way differently than the original strain.
10535,A healthcare system that held up for a year was almost overwhelmed.
10536,And it happened fast.
10537,You can choose to learn from the experiences of others or you can choose to remain in your echo chamber.

10546,I think you don't fully understand the scenario the person you responded to is discussing so I'll give you my perspective as a parent in Texas.
10547,"Here's a few facts:

1."
10548,Parents that do not ensure their kids are enrolled in and attend school of some kind are breaking the law and can actually have the cops come after them.
10549,2.
10550,The Texas governor has banned mask mandates and any requirements for schools and other government buildings putting limitations on people in order to prevent COVID (e.g.
10551,they can't ban recess or P.E.
10552,in enclosed areas or do social distancing as well if it's to fight COVID.)
10553,3.
10554,Kids under 12 will not be able to be vaccinated until after the school year starts.
10555,"The last I heard, Pfizer was going to seek permission to vaccinate kids under 12 potentially in September, and optimistically we'd probably be looking at October at the earliest for the first batch of kids to be able to have immunity."
10556,4.
10557,"A lot of parents in our communities are anti-mask and anti-vaccine, and complain loudly any time the school district does something to try to keep kids safer."
10558,The result is that no school district is going to stick their necks out to fight back against the state government in the face of these foaming at the mouth anti-vaxxers.
10559,My kids are wearing masks and taking the same precautions we took prior to my wife and I being vaccinated and that will end when they are vaccinated.
10560,"So my choices are basically a) pull them out of school and homeschool them where they're going to fall behind because we can't act as surrogate teachers, or b) send them to in-person classes where they'll get a better education but will be at risk for COVID until they can be vaccinated."
10561,"There's no good option frankly, and if it weren't for the Delta variant I don't think there would be a lot of hand-wringing over masks."
10562,"As for the risks, I think focusing only on death from COVID is a huge mistake, since there are [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7927578/) that say the risk of long COVID symptoms is about 50% (although to be fair, I've seen other studies as low as 20% and 40%.)"
10563,I'd prefer to not risk my kids having long-term problems from this.
10564,Parents are in an extremely difficult position right now.

10575,It‚Äôs amazing that people continue to cling to the idea that kids ‚Äúdon‚Äôt get‚Äù or ‚Äúdon‚Äôt spread‚Äù covid.
10576,"This is separate from them not being severely affected by it, which is overwhelmingly generally true."
10577,But a lot of people literally think kids don‚Äôt get it.
10578,Just‚Ä¶because.
10579,It‚Äôs mind blowing.
10580,This one respiratory illness acts differently than all the others we‚Äôve ever encountered and just doesn‚Äôt infect or transmit from humans under 12?!
10581,"It‚Äôs nuts

I had a few coworkers saying ‚Äúbut kids never really got it‚Äù and I showed them cdc data that showed they indeed did, at approximately 2/3 the rate of adults, and they just kind of said oh yeah‚Ä¶.and I could tell they somehow didn‚Äôt even believe that."
10582,"It‚Äôs no coincidence that as soon as kids went back to school, every time, within a month, that area‚Äôs covid cases started to climb rapidly."
10583,"Really hope they can get the kids vaccines authorized in the next month or two, but it‚Äôs not looking great."
10584,"I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to cause massive carnage like it did last year because of the vax wall that‚Äôs built up in a lot of our society now, but I fear kid cases and spread creating hollow statistics that will lead to people panicking, as well as just obviously I don‚Äôt want more cases than there need to be."

10590,*
10591,I mentioned this to my Doc (Urologist) last week as we discussed the anti-vax movement.
10592,It seems like the anti-vax folks like to clutch onto sources of data they can easily manipulate to support their confirmation biases.
10593,Or they can use it to spread fear and misinformation.
10594,"He specifically mentioned the sites VAERS and openEU because the internet has allowed millions to report ""anything"" that has happened post-vaccine to try to correlate it to the vaccine itself."
10595,His wife actually works for the CDC here in Virginia.
10596,"And he said that from what she stated at the kitchen table, what is in vaers and openeu is taken with a grain of salt until it can be corroborated."
10597,"She doesn't specifically validate it, but she says a team is sifting through the medical records they have based on the reports and much of it seems to be bullshit."
10598,She even mentioned they had to purge a few hundred data records that originated from Russia using a U.S.-based Proxy/VPN to pile on the misinformation within the database.
10599,"While vaers and openeu are great sources of information, it's too easily manipulated."
10600,"This is why I trust if something odd is up with this vaccine, the CDC will report it, as they have."
10601,Thank you very much.
10602,I am curious.
10603,I am from Canada and most of us here who had AstraZeneca first dose got a mRNA vaccine for second dose.
10604,"For example, I got Moderna on my 2nd shot."
10605,"I also have friends who had Pfizer first, got Moderna second."
10606,It is really weird but government didn't allow them to get Pfizer because they were saving those for 12-18 years old.
10607,I am glad that you feel better now.
10608,"Like most of here said, it could have been worse."
10609,Stay safe and take care!
10610,"Americans need to start developing their critical thinking skills, again."
10611,"You see, there is a big difference between ""near future"" and ""over the next 40 years."""
10612,"I thought the other guy was talking 5 years at the most and I was all like ""No way."""
10613,Maybe in communities with high vaccination rates.
10614,If you live in a place like I do where the fully vaccinated rate is still below 40% then you are looking at some potential for trouble.
10615,"Sure, for many of the non-vaccinated people it's a self-inflicted trauma, but we are still going to have to deal with it in these communities."
10616, &gt; Enjoy your stimulus checks.
10617,I didn't get a second stimulus check.
10618,"That's how ""dead end"" of a job I work."
10619,Projection much?
10620,Maybe a little self-reflection would do you good buddy.
10621,Blocking you now.
10622,Have a good day!
10623,**say it again a little louder**
10624,**when vaccinated**
10625,"Considering Florida's low vaccination percentage, school starting for my district August 2nd, and the spread of Delta, is there a point where eventually cases will go down?"
10626,"Currently, due to laws and regulations, I can't ask my students to wear masks (I teach at a state University) and my son's school/ daycare is ""masks optional"" which was better than the daycares that deny Covid even exists."
10627,"It's probably going to look like the Delta wave in the UK and in Israel, with cases up but hospitalizations increasing much less than in past waves and with death increasing very much less than in past waves."
10628,"The hospitalization rate isn‚Äôt as age dependent as the mortality rate, but it‚Äôs still age dependent."
10629,"Seniors are 4-15x more likely to be hospitalized with Covid than 18-29 year olds, according to the CDC."
10630,"With most seniors vaccinated, we should see an uncoupling of case rates to hospitalizations."
10631,"Not as dramatic as the drop in mortality rate, but still important, especially if hospital capacity is still what‚Äôs driving public policy."
10632,"Lol

Hope you don't get long covid"
10633,"&gt; Sinovac as the first shot and AZ as the second shot

10640,The fact that they're doing this when only [half the population](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations) is fully vaccinated seems like a bizarre experiment to me.
10641,Like *hopefully* the hospitals can handle it and most of the vulnerable people are safe and the virus doesn't evolve any new tricks.
10642,There's really reason to think it could work.
10643,But the odds would be much better if they just waited to vaccinate more people.
10644,People who show Covid symptoms should be tested for covid so the proper authorities are given enough data points to see the community spread of the disease.
10645,"Well I gave my answer, so what of it?"
10646,[deleted]
10647,Well I don't care about idiots.
10648,"I got COVID in May last year, almost died twice in hospital from pneumonia a few weeks later."
10649,"Have since had the flu jab, pneumonia jab and both Pfizer COVID jabs this year."
10650,Suspect going forward the main casualties of COVID will be the anti-vaxers.
10651,It would be an interesting statistic.
10652,My neighbor's son and son's wife didn't want to get the vaccine.
10653,Now his son's wife has Covid while trying to care for their two kids by herself since son is off on a military stint.
10654,"faafo, I guess."
10655,"If you don't already do it, then i will advise you to try "" [Smell training](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-56865129) ""."
10656,I think they‚Äôre just asking to get an idea of the impact of vaccines.
10657,Under 12 can‚Äôt get the jab.
10658,I was curious as well.
10659,Well it has bugs‚Ä¶
10660,"Spanish flu mutated to be less deadly, it's still prevalent today."
10661,It wasn't herd immunity.
10662,I had Covid and then I got vaccinated when I had the chance.
10663,I was sick for a day from vaccination (Moderna) I assure you it was nothing compared to being sick from Covid hospitalization for 6 days.
10664,The loss of breathing is the scariest thing in life.
10665,"Seeing that in children, I can't even imagine it"
10666,I mean the cdc was pretty clear that if you are vaxxed you don‚Äôt need to wear masks but did not say that about the unvaccinated.
10667,This country failed them?
10668,They could get a life saving vaccine today a year and a half into a novel pandemic‚Ä¶ pretty sure without America that would not be possible.
10669,I can‚Äôt speak for them.
10670,I‚Äôd hope so.
10671,I‚Äôm worried about my own.
10672,Genuine question - why is it taking so long?
10673,Is there a resource that describes this approval process?
10674,Same.
10675,I panicked when my lymph nodes swelled but then I did my own researched and learned it was normal when you took the vaccine because that shows that your body's immune system is reacting.
10676,Now it is almost gone and I feel fine but still a bit worry because I don't know what other reactions the vaccines might have given me.
10677,"Overall, I say take the vaccine."
10678,"It would be a disaster, after you put it in 2/3 of your population's body and then refuse to fully approve it"
10679,Macron himself is quite a populist.
10680,"Earlier in the pandemic when it seemed like vaccine skepticism was politically expedient, Macron was flying the antivax flag."
10681,"Now that the French are getting vaccinated at a higher rate than polls predicted, Macron is changing his tune."
10682,"I mean to be fair there are a lot of medical professionals who left or will leave the profession after this, either due to burn out or just not wanting to deal with these people."
10683,*Sigh* Again?
10684,"The numbers published daily by Rospotrebnadzor are the *operative data*, they include only the people, whose death was registered the previous day and where it was determined that COVID was the primary cause of death and it was confirmed by PCR tests."
10685,"Rosstat (the national statistics agency) publishes ""natural population movement"" reports (births, deaths, marriages, divorces) monthly and those include a separate sheet with COVID deaths in four groups: COVID is the primary cause of death; COVID is suspected as the primary cause of death; COVID isn't the primary cause but significantly contributed; COVID neither the primary cause nor significantly contributed."
10686,I know.
10687,"Even people I know who were being safe and logical the entire time, once they got vaccinated, that all went out the window."
10688,Even people with kids under 12!
10689,It‚Äôs as if covid disappeared and isn‚Äôt a thing anymore.
10690,Only‚Ä¶it is
10691,The lesson about covid vaccination and the dangers of the disease seem to only be learned one family at a time among certain groups of people.
10692,"It's a fake problem until it strikes down someone near them, and even then, not all of them are going to really be honest with themselves about what happened and why."
10693,Do you think the parents of these kids would let them get vaccinated?
10694,"Great, now you don't make sense at all anymore."
10695,"You are telling lies, even saying the variant are because vaccines."

10730,"A system of health checks and mandatory coronavirus rapid tests for venues where social distancing could not be guaranteed was put in place, but cracked under the large number of people looking for a night out after months of lockdown."
10731,"Well yes and no I've seen the UK numbers and over 95% of 60+yo are vaccinated, 75% of 30-60yo and 60% of 18-30yo."
10732,"I'd say those are good numbers everyone who's at risk of dying is protected, no reason to escalate things just make it available to whoever wants it."
10733,"I agree having it certified is very important, and it may bring more vaccine reluctant onboard but only if those people trust the process and the data is transparent enough and gets picked as such to the wider public."
10734,Bullshit article from a bullshit newspaper.
10735,Just because most kids don't get seriously ill from COVID doesn't mean some won't.
10736,"I would err on the side of caution, and I really don't care if you have a problem with that."
10737,Have people both died from the vaccine and Covid?
10738,Yes.
10739,Then let me live my life and you live yours.
10740,"If the vaccine works, you'll be fine."
10741,Don't worry about me
10742,She was fired precisely because she was trying to do her job correctly.
10743,Many more doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine have been given than the J&amp;J vaccine.
10744,"No, they vaccinated people spread it too, and we have variants are more likely from vaccinated people."
10745,As shown by all the variants nonsense starting after starting vaccinations
10746,[removed]
10747,"Their way of protection is the rest of society getting vaccinated, what are you on about?"
10748,‚Ä¶ now it‚Äôs going to be 1508 people dying per day and it‚Äôs going up.
10749,Not sure what argument you are trying to make.
10750,The UK‚Äôs numbers have not leveled off.
10751,They keep rising.
10752,How many long-term studies are there on COVID?
10753,People already dead are likely to stay dead on long term for sure.
10754,But for all the survivors?
10755,How long will it take for my smell to come back?
10756,Smell disappeared because of neuron damage: are there other long term effects for the brain?
10757,How many years of life expectancy did people having a ¬´mild¬ª version lose?
10758,These are the questions you should be asking.
10759,"Small reminder: COVID vaccines are just a part of the virus genome (the part that lets your immune system recognize it, not the part that allows the virus to replicate)."
10760,"If you're afraid of the vaccine, you should be terrified of the virus."
10761,Also: people that aren't vaccinating are doing health decisions for me.
10762,It's ok as long as they stay away from me.
10763,This law just allows them to live their own life as long as they don't take risks to give me (again‚Ä¶) COVID.
10764,[removed]
10765,Can you explain what you mean?
10766,I would guess the vaccines have been administered approximately the same amount.
10767,Good thing I‚Äôm not a medical professional because I would be phoning it the f*ck in if I had to ‚Äúcare‚Äù for people like this.
10768,"No, I do not wish to tie it back like you presumed."
10769,"I asked because a lot of people you argue with only think about what they don't want to happen, not what they'd actually do if they had too."
10770,Overall we aren't that far apart and I think my phrasing was a bit rough.
10771,29 per week is ~8 per day.
10772,1500 people died every day pre covid.
10773,"so yes, you are wrong, 0 risk, with the vaccine I am safer in a pub full of unvaccinated people that got covid than driving"
10774,[deleted]
10775,I'll add a bit.
10776,"When compared to Western Europe and North America, we are less likely to rush to the doctor with anything, as it's said there are two categories of diseases: bullshit and fucking shit - from the former you recover on your own, and the later is untreatable, so in any case there's no point in going to a doctor."
10777,Of the people I know who got COVID none panicked about it and none was talking about it afterwards unless relevant to the conversation.
10778,In my perception the percentage of the people who are against vaccines in general or wary of COVID vaccines specifically isn't high.
10779,"If you read comments on some Russian news site regarding COVID you will find such people, they usually either mistrust Russian-made vaccines (because ""the industry is in shambles, so they couldn't have made anything decent"") and wait for approval of a Western vaccine (Chinese-made are mistrusted too), or mistrust all COVID vaccines due to the speed of development and lack of long-term testing, finding them in real-life is more difficult."
10780,"Personally, I know only one guy of the later group (and none of the former), his position can be summarized as ""Ours are probably just water with labels for the show, now those guys in Europe could actually be injecting people with some untested stuff""."
10781,Wow!
10782,Was there any one or 2 things that convinced her?
10783,How‚Äôd you do it?
10784,This is what I understood as well.
10785,It would essentially have to mutate into a whole new virus to evade the mRNA shots.
10786,"Still worrisome, thinking about the fall - young kids going back to school, people huddling inside."
10787,I'm not so much worried for myself and most fully vaccinated people I know - but it's gonna have it's ripple effects through society and take it's toll in other ways.
10788,Hopefully there's not enough of a vector to take down our hospital systems again.
10789,And I hope that it doesn't mutate in such a way that it causes more severe illness in small children.
10790,That would be a nightmare scenario this fall.
10791,I know.
10792,:( I just feel sorry for the kids.
10793,"I find it hilarious that they gave you one link which he thought proved his conspiracy theory that turned out to do have a ton of evidence against it then when you pointed it out to him he's like ""no bro, ignore that, let me throw you another one"" and that one also emphasized the importance of mask wearing."
10794,Hopefully this absurd idea will be reversed soon.
10795,"Don't worry too much about the downvotes, this sub is pure zealots and not really representative."
10796,"Oh actually nevermind, the rule was indeed reversed already."
10797,Sanity prevails.
10798,"Nice thought, but it will not."
10799,That's where you are wrong.
10800,"They are also a danger to others, to contaminate them, to spread the virus and create new variants.."
10801,[removed]
10802,One question is how much the age for new cases has been lowered.
10803,"Because we've seen the age go down before, like in the fall/winter, and hospitalizations/deaths still shot up."
10804,"Here is an example from November:

&gt;**Why fewer people are dying of COVID-19, even as cases surge**  
&gt;  
&gt;but the demographic shift is clear ‚Äî with 18-to-29-year-olds lately accounting for the largest share of new cases across all age groups."
10805,Only in their own mind.
10806,Anyone forcing masks on children is at this point operating in a completely alternate reality.
10807,I'm nervous that although I'm vaccinated I'm going to catch a variant.
10808,You and I can't do anything...
10809,But state officials need to figure out a way to get vaccination rates up.
10810,Recently attended my first Catholic wedding and I was surprised at how much the mass was about having children for the sole purpose of advancing God's kingdom and not about love... at all.
10811,Fair enough.
10812,What's the complicated answer?
10813,Did you look?
10814,they went from averaging 9 deaths per week last month to 29 deaths per week today.
10815,"Last month they had 7k cases a week, now they have 33k."
10816,"You can do the math, it seems like deaths are actually outpacing known cases."
10817,"There will never be deaths like last year, but we are also seeing deaths aren‚Äôt staying flat either."
10818,Yeah but the average age of death was relatively unchanged.
10819,Now we have just about every senior citizen vaccinated.
10820,Reinstate?
10821,Where in the US were there ever vaccine/negative test mandates for indoor dining?
10822,I hope Germany follows
10823,"Ask them why their supplements and essential oils haven‚Äôt been FDA approved, then."
10824,[removed]
10825,Dropping the mask mandate just encouraged antivaxxers who were begrudgingly wearing their masks at times to drop their masks entirely.
10826,Lol...how to on-ramp onto a freeway!
10827,"&gt; and then retroactively makes it approved cause they don‚Äôt want to scare people

congrats to yall on coming up with the new excuse anti-vaxxers are going to use when its approved."
10828,"""Well of course they approved it."
10829,they had to.
10830,"I'm still not taking it because it was politically motivated"""
10831,There is a reason the EU waited another month and got the full approval before starting the vaccinations.
10832,"This is almost definitely a marketing play by the pharma companies to discredit other companies, and secure brand loyalty."
10833,"The vaccine industry is not profitable in the long term, so they need to make as much $$$ as possible in the shortest time possible."
10834,"Everyone is emotionally fragile at the moment, and a secure future sales/brand loyalty when they bring out the yearly booster shot."
10835,Let‚Äôs not forget that pharma is a dirty business‚Ä¶
10836,[removed]
10837,"Oh yeah, we had that too."
10838,Actually my mom developed a neurological issue after Covid so it wasn't all just unfounded fear.
10839,"Luckily it's not something permanent, but it's still messed up."
10840,"I‚Äôve already seen ‚ÄúOkay, anything can be FDA approved but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs safe.‚Äù Literally the stupidest thing I‚Äôve ever read"
10841,How many long-term studies are there on the vaccine?
10842,This is tyranny and your trying to make health decisions for other people.
10843,"I guess, but they are still at risk."
10844,There are plenty of people that also didn't get vaccinated.
10845,"There's no separate system for travelling, the only difference is that your test result has to be signed by a doctor, certifying that it was done properly and that you were the person who took the test."
10846,"All entry requirements are determined by national governments, but I've travelled a decent amount within the EU and have never needed a PCR test."
10847,Isn't approval really just a formality at this point?
10848,"I'm fine with them following the letter of normal procedure, especially since on a practical level we have pretty good reason to trust that the vaccines are pretty safe for the wide majority of people."
10849,"look at UK data, data has already proven you wrong"
10850,I finally convinced my fence-sitting friend to get vaccinated!
10851,"But now i'm terrified if she even feels one ache, she's going to blame me and refuse to get her second shot lol oh boy."
10852,"Bonus points, her parents are anti-vaxxers so she's going behind their back."
10853,[removed]
10854,[removed]
10855,"You want mask mandates now, because boosters might eventually be needed?"
10856,"Boosters might be needed yearly, so do you think the mask mandate should be permanent?"
10857,Isn't it odd to hope for a mask mandate for when the vaccine is working?
10858,"Wouldn't it be logical to hope for the mandate to be instated when the protection starts waning (if it does, we don't know that yet)?"
10859,Thank you!!!
10860,!
10861,"So much information from here I want to share with my parents, but can't."
10862,"Unfortunately, they think Fauci is untrustworthy, and that the FDA has their hands tied in this matter."

10871,My parents are flying to the US this weekend to visit family and I am terrified.
10872,"They are fully vaccinated but they are seniors, and aren't in the healthiest shape."
10873,They will be flying for 15 hours straight.
10874,"Whereas here in our home country they were very cautious about going out, in the US I know they'll be visiting multiple relatives, going out in public and doing some general sight-seeing."
10875,I tried to convince them to wait at least a couple of months before traveling but they wouldn't listen.
10876,"Yes, I know vaccines work, and I'm vaccinated myself and that the chances of them being hospitalized  are extremely low."
10877,But I can't help but feel anxiety over this and I suppose I just needed a place to share.

10879,I wish they‚Äôd be more specific.
10880,Are these teenagers or toddlers?
10881,You do know you are supposed to get a flu vaccine every year right?
10882,"It's not just about raw numbers, but the rate implying it is more than random chance."
10883,"I posed a hypothetical scenario, and also a reason as to why they have a rigid process."
10884,"Americans were dying because they weren‚Äôt wearing masks, acted as if covid was a hoax, still gathered in large groups and stadiums, selling out games, and generally just being cocks about the whole thing."
10885,"The lack of a vaccine didn‚Äôt cause that, their stupid selfish mindsets are what killed them."
10886,"New Zealand got down to 0 cases before a vaccine was even produced because they stuck to the game plan, don‚Äôt blame people dying on the lack of vaccines being available right away, that‚Äôs just not true."
10887,Immunocompromised people don't have TIME to wait for this.
10888,Delta is blowing up NOW.
10889,"&gt;Personally, I plan to watch my own ass  just as I did when the CDC said don‚Äôt wear a mask when it was obvious that the virus was airborne."
10890,You clearly want to believe a certain narrative.
10891,"The CDC said this on February 12, 2020:

&gt;CDC does not currently recommend the use of face masks for the general public."
10892,This virus is not spreading in the community.
10893,"If you are sick or a patient under investigation and not hospitalized, CDC recommends wearing a face mask when around other people and before entering a health care provider‚Äôs office, but when you are alone, in your home, you do not need to wear a mask."
10894,"People who are in close contact with someone with novel coronavirus, for example, household contacts and care givers of people with known or suspected 2019, I‚Äôm sorry, nCoV 2019, we should wear a face mask if they are in the same room as the patient and that patient is not able to wear a face mask."
10895,Health care personnel should wear PPE including respirators when caring for confirmed or possible nCoV patients because they‚Äôre in direct contact with those patients which increases their risk of exposure.
10896,Want to guess how many new cases there were in the US on that day?
10897,Zero.
10898,It was also clearly not suspected of being airborne.
10899,"If you worked for the CDC back then, you would have made the same call."
10900,"It's so easy to sit here, a year and a half later, and act like everyone should have known then what we know now."
10901,Here's some light reading about the effects of asymptomatic and mild/moderate cases.
10902,It seems that there's a lot we're still discovering about the effects of Covid-19 and their duration.
10903,Asymptomatic doesn't equal an absence of ill effects... but this was done prevaccine.
10904,"It might be a while before we see... As you say, it's logical to \*assume\* improvement but I think a lot of people also assumed that mild or no symptoms also meant nothing was happening internally they weren't aware of."
10905,"‚ÄúThe researchers found elevations of C5b9 in pediatric patients with severe COVID-19 and MIS-C, but to their surprise, they also found that C5b9 was elevated in patients with minimal or asymptomatic disease."
10906,"Of the 22 patients for whom complete data were available, 19 (86%) met the criteria for TMA \[thrombotic microangiopathy\]."
10907,"Additionally, sC5b9 levels were elevated both in patients who did and did not meet criteria for TMA."
10908,"Although most children with COVID-19 do not have severe disease, our study shows that there may be other effects of SARS-CoV-2 that are worthy of investigation.‚Äù

10909,"Among the 139 patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized in Yeungnam University Hopistal in Daegu, South Korea, 10 (7.2%) were asymptomatic."
10910,Their chest CT and radiographic findings were analyzed.
10911,"Results: In the results, all patients (100%) had ground-glass opacity (GGO) on chest CT. Further, the GGO lesions were predominantly distributed peripherally and posteriorly in all patients."

10914,15% reported moderate to severe symptoms &gt;8 months post infection.
10915,"Comparing seropositive vs seronegative participants, 26% vs 9% reported at least 1 moderate to severe symptom lasting for at least 2 months (RR, 2.9 \[95% CI, 2.2-3.8\]) and 15% vs 3% reported at least 1 moderate to severe symptom lasting for at least 8 months (RR, 4.4 \[95% CI, 2.9-6.7\]) (Table)."

10929,Majority do.
10930,"It's the minority that is dragging us down, and it's frustrating as heck cause some leadership in this country support their lies and conspiracies."
10931,vaccine efficacy is a ratio comparing vaccinated to unvaccinated.
10932,"If it is 90% effective, then that means if 10 unvaccinated people would have gotten it, instead 1 vaccinated person would."
10933,"That's great and the vaccines are wonderful, but that still means that as cases go up in general, they also go up for vaccinated people."
10934,"Rationally, vaccinated people should not want cases to go up."
10935,.. and it‚Äôs not even winter yet.
10936,"If it‚Äôs starting to surge now, imagine what‚Äôs going to happen to these areas when cold weather arrives and more people go indoors?"

10952,Even Gottlieb is not screaming from the rooftops that they‚Äôre needed.
10953,On face the nation this week he (I‚Äôm paraphrasing) said that they (Pfizer) believe that some people (mostly older people who were vaccinated early) may benefit from a third dose going into the fall.
10954,"To make that possible, they need to do the study and submit the info to fda now so that in 2-3 months, the option is available if it‚Äôs deemed necessary/beneficial."
10955,And that is why this Delta and other variants are going to be even worse for them.
10956,It's a roll of the dice without a vaccine.
10957,"No way that happens, goalposts will move."
10958,"""FDA is corrupt"", ""I never trusted the FDA"", etc."
10959,Yes we have.
10960,And there's a ton of other differences this time.
10961,So surprising that someone would think that we can predict what is going to happen in this surge based on what happened in last surge.
10962,"Probably not, people all clutched their pearls and said ""what unimaginable devastation"" when a few thousand people died in China or Italy, and said that predictions of 200,000 deaths in the US were outlandishly apocalyptic."
10963,When the numbers blew past that though they immediately began rationalizing and making excuses.
10964,"A few hundred thousand more died and they still said this was a nothing burger, that we need to ""get serious"" and reopen the offices because it's a joke that people aren't out at in-person work."
10965,"Given the way that people reacted to this as what they claimed to be impossible fearmongering kept coming true, I'm pretty sure they would've behaved exactly the same if this had a 10% mortality rate and killed all age groups in equal proportions."
10966,"Sounds like an easy wrongful termination case to win, especially if what they told her about poking the bear and such was in writing and relatively close to the termination"
10967,I hear you.
10968,I posted on here early on when I was vaccinated.
10969,I felt nothing for either shot.
10970,I was not impacted.
10971,And I mean obviously most people have realized it‚Äôs pretty mild compared to actually getting covid.
10972,It‚Äôs just a shame that some people are still so nervous
10973,Populism is a hell of a drug.
10974,Is there any evidence at all of that claim?
10975,"&gt; It's sick and depressing how many sociopaths are out there

Psychologists have been telling us for a long time it was 30%."
10976,1 out of every 3.
10977,Technically what they say is that 30% have Dark Triad traits.
10978,Now maybe people will believe them.
10979,"Most likely they wouldn't reject approval they would only approve it for people over 60 for example, where risk benefits look different."
10980,Some still do.
10981,Yep.
10982,"Backwards ass, easily manipulated people stuck in the past and a corrupt, conniving Party."
10983,In a pandemic if you wait for proper approval the pandemic would be almost over making the vaccine useless.
10984,"Look at the deaths per day in USA since the introduction of the vaccines in Jan, and they have gone significantly down."
10985,So the issue is cost vs benefits.
10986,"They already had major studies showing their effectiveness, and they were going to do massive monitoring when they were rolled out."
10987,"Indeed, that is how the problems with the one vaccine were found."
10988,"&gt; I kind of wish the side effects weren‚Äôt  as bad

They're not."
10989,I had a sore arm for a day after the first shot and felt like I had a hangover for a few hours the day after the second one.
10990,Everyone I know had the same or at worst cold/flu-like symptoms for a day.
10991,It's a tiny tiny percentage of people who have a severe reaction but they feel like they need to broadcast it to the world for some reason.

11011,If you‚Äôre vaccinated you pose no threat to kids nor anyone else.
11012,C‚Äômon now.

11014,"Night clubs won't be allowed to open until September, provided the number of cases etc are low enough."
11015,"Thank you for sharing your life with me, kind stranger."
11016,I appreciate your perspective and your attention to how nuanced the impacts of COVID have been‚Äîespecially on mental health.
11017,"Right away, I was pleased to read that you are a mother and have empathy for those subsets of the population who are unable to protect themselves."
11018,"I feel for you, your family, and your present day life."
11019,"Sadly, a similar situation is being played out across the world for millions of families."
11020,As for me ‚Äî I am a first-time father only knowing what it‚Äôs like to care for a pregnant wife and raise a baby during a pandemic.
11021,The nesting has been *real*.
11022,My biggest concern for my child is that we do not know the long-term effects of the virus.
11023,Can it stay dormant in a host until some random event triggers a reactivation?
11024,"I will say this ‚Äî I have zero fucks to give for healthy adults who choose to not receive the vaccine, including parents of small children."
11025,They will be the reason why this virus mutates and the pandemic continues until it becomes endemic.
11026,"As a Californian, I support this 1000%."
11027,"This kind of thing is why I want my kids vaccinated despite it popular on here for people to say stuff like ""kids don't get sick""."
11028,This is the part I don't get.
11029,"The Polio vaccine has been mandatory since 1966 here (Italy), and as of 2019 96% of children aged 4 or below have indeed taken it."
11030,I really don't understand why antivaxxers seem to think that a vaccine being mandatory for adults is a limitation of freedom when them being mandatory for children was never a problem.

11066,Consider not doing them.
11067,Given the warped acceptance of dystopian restrictions has changed drastically since we‚Äôve gotten safer.
11068,Weird how vaccine passports have only garnered massive support after our numbers dropped massively
11069,they wont know to be isolated until theyve been contagious for over a week though.
11070,"Again, you dont IMMEDIATELY show signs of being sick, but you ARE contagious before showing signs of being sick."
11071,"They will have felt fine, with no reason to isolate and been going around in public spreading it for a week or more before they ever know they even have it."
11072,"What point are you even trying to make here, aside from proving you dont know how viruses work?"
11073,"States like Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, etc."
11074,are going to get wrecked by Delta in the Fall if they don't get their heads out of their asses with vaccination soon.
11075,"You do realize the legal precedent for that is forced vaccination (Jacobson v Michigan) later cited as a reason for eugenics (Buck v Bell),  and later the in Japanese internment camps in the US (Korematsu)."
11076,And the new Civil Rights and Disability Protections made sure such precedents are rarely cited.
11077,You'll find good law debates on this I believe Kennedy and Dershowitz even Barnes do a good job.
11078,&gt; WHO has no jurisdiction to approve (or not) drugs for the EU though?
11079,"Just because WHO approved something, doesn't mean it is or should be approved elsewhere."
11080,I agree.
11081,&gt; Are you suggesting countries delegate their public health and review process to WHO?
11082,"So EMA, FDA, health Canada just delegate to WHO?"
11083,"No, I don't."
11084,&gt; Doesn't work like that and definitely shouldn't.
11085,"Again, I agree."
11086,&gt; Edit: I mean should FDA not have inspected emergent plant and wait for who?
11087,I don't know what you're talking about here.
11088,I think the FDA should have the right to inspect factories before they approve vaccines and other medicines for use on US citizens.
11089,I really don't think any of this has anything to do with what we're discussing here.
11090,Which is: why does France reject travelers that are vaccinated with a WHO approved vaccine that other European countries like Germany accept and that is functionally identical to AZ?
11091,"Indeed that is a massive opparation to do for the companies that need to verify, and not ready for it yet like miles away."
11092,&gt;I'm speaking as an American.
11093,"In my opinion, the EU is a single entity."
11094,Well then your opinion is wrong.
11095,The only thing that has been coordinate was vaccine procurement and the DCC system (meaning the actual certificate - how many doses you need to enter and so on is not).
11096,Everything else is up to the inidividual countries and the rules vary wildly.
11097,The amount of unvaccinated people at any real risk (not kids) is incredibly small.
11098,It‚Äôs a choice
11099,"Yeah, I have a hard time believing more than maybe 5% of the people hesitating because it's not officially approved in these threads are going to take it just because it is."
11100,Have you taken a look at a graph of covid cases in Hungary?
11101,Can't argue with results.
11102,Just open the bus windows and let the outside air circulate through the bus.
11103,South Carolina is warm year round.
11104,"I‚Äôm unaware of anything like that, although I too have not read everything."
11105,I certainly think it‚Äôs something reasonable to wonder and I assume there will be studies and will be interested to read them.
11106,I do however think that it‚Äôs pretty reasonable to read between the lines based on what we know about the vaccines.
11107,"Knowing that they prevent at the bare minimum the majority of infections (could change as antibodies wane, but even the most pessimistic current reports have them at 64% efficacy for preventing infection), and in the case of breakthroughs they elicit immune responses that clear the virus quicker (which means less chance to pervade and damage systems) and keep the viral load lower (less virus to to pervade and damage systems)."
11108,"Couple that with the fact that yes, those things can happen with asymptomatic/mild cases, but not as likely as with severe cases (I don‚Äôt have numbers to cite but given the massive amount of people who have recovered fine I think it‚Äôs a fair general assertion), then I think it‚Äôs pretty reasonable to assume that it‚Äôs POSSIBLE for vaccinated asymptomatic cases to have such long-term complications, but just as reasonable to assume that they would be significantly reduced."
11109,"I know that‚Äôs not ‚Äúscientific,‚Äù but I think it‚Äôs logical nonetheless."
11110,Naw.
11111,I changed my entire career path because of covid making me leave a country I was working in.
11112,I hate these kind of bullshit ‚Äújust a little change‚Äù shit.
11113,I‚Äôm getting back into the arts work now that I did my part and fully vaccinated.
11114,I‚Äôm not a sociopath for wanting to live my life again after we‚Äôve made amazing vaccines available to everyone that has any real risk
11115,"This says that:

&gt; More than 78% of those 65 and older are fully vaccinated

So, a little more than 1/5th are not."
11116,"Even if it's only 1/5th the number of cases for older people than it would be without vaccines, if the spread  and case numbers go up more than 5X, you get more deaths from that group than if there were no vaccines but lower case rates."
11117,"There's also some evidence that older people are more likely to get breakthrough cases and deaths from those breakthrough cases (I assume because their immune systems are not as strong), so there's that, too."
11118,"I 100% agree that there will be fewer deaths than if there were no vaccines, all else equal."
11119,That is true and undeniable.

11254,"From the article:

&gt; The average number of new daily COVID-19 cases has increased 94 percent over the past two weeks, according to data from The New York Times, as worries over outbreaks climb nationwide."
11255,"&gt; The U.S. recorded a seven-day average of more than 23,000 daily cases on Monday, almost doubling from the average two weeks ago, as less than half of the total population is fully vaccinated."
11256,"&gt; Monday‚Äôs count of 32,105 newly confirmed cases pushed the seven-day average up from its Sunday level of more than 19,000 new cases ‚Äî a 60 percent increase from two weeks prior."

11258,&gt; This comes as the highly transmissible delta variant was declared the dominant strain in the U.S. last week.
11259,"&gt; At the same time, vaccinations have stalled with the daily rate reaching its lowest point during President Biden‚Äôs tenure on Sunday at slightly more than 506,000."
11260,"Monday saw a small uptick in the average rate to more than 527,000 per day, according to Our World in Data."
11261,&gt; The rise in case counts come as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says just 48 percent of the total population is fully vaccinated.

11266,The country fell short of the president's goal to get 70 percent of adults at least one dose by the Fourth of July.
11267,&gt; Increases in COVID-19 cases have previously signaled during the pandemic an upcoming rise in hospitalizations and deaths.
11268,"The Times data shows that the average deaths are still reducing, but the average daily hospitalizations are climbing with a 16 percent increase from two weeks ago."
11269,"&gt; Still, case counts are much lower than the devastating peak that hit the U.S. in January, and experts say the country will not reach that level of infection again as vulnerable populations have gotten vaccinated."
11270,Seventy-nine percent of those aged 65 and older are considered fully vaccinated.
11271,"I have a suspicion you've misunderstood me, as the 'alter their lives a little' that I'm referring to are the social distancing and masking."
11272,Which are *simple and easy* things to do.
11273,"I don't know what you went through that made all that happen to you, but none of that is what I was talking about."
11274,Unless you're saying you left your country because you didn't want to social distance or mask up?
11275,In which case we'd be having a totally different conversation....
11276,Not necessarily.
11277,"There's been rumblings of younger people getting sicker for a while, but no one is putting out numbers really to figure out if it is true or not."
11278,"It's the same in western europe (Italy here), I think they asked me like *once* in my life, at a supermarket."
11279,This obsession with IDs is mostly an American thing.
11280,Kinda ironic that they have a whole movement of people who don't want to show IDs *to the police* but have no problem showing them to a random dude at a bar...
11281,Weren‚Äôt those places threatening jail or other harsh punishment for failure to get vaccinated?
11282,This has been common knowledge since march 2020.
11283,You‚Äôre posting in the coronavirus sub.
11284,Maybe you should learn some basic facts first.
11285,"In a sense we're at a point where a lot of people are wilfully refusing vaccination for themselves, and everyone else wants to get the shot and move on with their lives."
11286,The last piece of that latter group's armor that needs to be in place is vaccines for all children.
11287,Obviously.
11288,"I wish I could say Tennessee was much better but we lead the world at one point, so... hooray."
11289,You might be right.
11290,"I guess I'm thinking of the number of parents that would actively block their kids from getting vaccinated vs. given the choice themselves, a higher percentage of this age group would probably take it regardless of what their parents want in this matter."
11291,Technically can be if you‚Äôre driving fine and some idiot t bones or rear ends you
11292,The science doesn't say you shouldn't wear masks.
11293,The CDC's interpretation of the science is that if you're vaccinated the risk associated with not wearing one is low enough that it doesn't need to be mandated.
11294,"It does not follow from that, that being more risk averse is ""ignoring science"" ‚Äî especially since the cost of wearing masks in stores is so low."
11295,"That is, unless you have an ideological bugaboo about them."
11296,I'd disagree because look at what happened with Polio- Americans lined up for vaccinations when it was mostly children getting severely ill.
11297,I didn't realise Simon from The Inbetweeners had become a journalist.

11299,Nah.
11300,I have been posting TWiV for more than a year.
11301,"KUALA LUMPUR - Malaysia reported 11,079 new coronavirus cases on Tuesday (July 13), the first time daily infections have hit five figures, amid a health crisis that has seen hospitals and Covid-19 assessment centres flooded with patients."
11302,"The previous daily record was logged just three days ago on Saturday, with 9,353 cases."
11303,Tuesday also saw 125 deaths and a record 972 patients in intensive care.
11304,"Selangor, the country‚Äôs most populous state, reported the bulk of the new infections with 5,263 cases, or 47.5 per cent of the total."
11305,"The federal territory of Kuala Lumpur, which is surrounded by the state of Selangor, logged 1,521 infections, the second highest in the country."
11306,"At 855,949 cases overall, Malaysia has one of South-east Asia‚Äôs highest per-capita infection rates."
11307,"One of the reasons for the rise is the emergence of the Delta variant which can spread via airborne transmission, said Health director-general Noor Hisham Abdullah."
11308,"‚ÄúWe were informed that the Delta variant is now the dominant variant,‚Äù he told a news conference."
11309,"The number of infections is projected to further increase in the next two weeks before stabilising, he added."
11310,"There are concerns about the rising number of cases, deaths and patients in hospitals, even as large chunks of Malaysia including Selangor and KL are into its seventh week of total lockdown, and with the government boasting that a high number of people have been inoculated."
11311,"Nearly 11.8 million Malaysians have received at least one dose of the vaccine by Monday, or about 24.8 per cent of the population, said Health Minister Adham Baba."
11312,They included 11.3 per cent (3.68 million) who have received the full dosage.
11313,Social media has been awash with video clips and pictures of bodies piling up in hospitals.
11314,"A viral 15-minute video uploaded on YouTube on Monday purportedly had distressed frontliners comparing the healthcare system in the Klang Valley - Malaysia‚Äôs most populated districts comprising KL, Putrajaya and most of Selangor - to a sunken ship."
11315,‚ÄúWe are replacing oxygen canisters by the hour.
11316,"Some patients might be required to share oxygen with five other patients,‚Äù said an unnamed frontliner."
11317,"There is also a shortage in medications used for the past few weeks, said another frontliner."
11318,"‚ÄúWe are not receiving help from the headquarters and we are dying in this battle,‚Äù she said."
11319,"No images of the frontliners were shown and their voices appeared to have been altered to protect their identities, as there is a gag order against health workers making unauthorised comments."
11320,"Meanwhile, a vaccination centre in the Selangor capital of Shah Alam was shut down for a day on Tuesday after 204 workers tested positive for Covid-19, following a mass screening exercise on all 453 workers and volunteers."
11321,"Those who tested positive have been isolated and a new team of workers will man the Ideal Convention Centre on Wednesday after the centre is sanitised, officials said."
11322,The government has been on the defensive as the caseloads have continued to climb six months into a state of emergency that was imposed in mid-January with the stated aim of taming the disease.
11323,"Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin on Tuesday visited a key Selangor hospital which is struggling with the influx of patients, and said help is on the way for the Tengku Ampuan Rahimah Hospital in Klang town."
11324,"He said  an additional RM100 million (S$32 million) would be spent on outsourcing healthcare in the Klang Valley, while an additional 151 beds would be added to the hospital along with another 15 ventilators."
11325,"‚ÄúI have ordered (the authorities) to look into the mental health of (frontliners) and the people and ensure that the welfare and morale of health workers are taken care of,‚Äù he said, as quoted as saying by Astro Awani news channel."
11326,"For patients who have tested positive, their nightmare does not end there."
11327,"They have to queue up at Covid-19 assessment centres, or CACs, for authorities to determine whether they will be sent to hospitals, quarantine and treatment centres, or undergo quarantine at home."
11328,"On Monday, more than 4,000 Covid-19 patients flocked to the Malawati Stadium, one of Selangor‚Äôs biggest CACs."
11329,"Photos and video clips of people of all ages, including infants in strollers, queuing on public roads while waiting for their turn to be assessed by medical personnel raised both alarm and anger."
11330,A Covid-19 patient who underwent an assessment at Malawati Stadium last week (July 6) told The Straits Times that it took  six hours to complete the process.
11331,"‚ÄúThey told me there were 2,000 people there that day."
11332,"I arrived at 10.30am, and finished at 4.30pm."
11333,"It was not as crazy as it is now,‚Äù said the patient, who declined to be named."
11334,"Meanwhile, residents in Klang town have protested against the location of a CAC in the housing estate of Taman Sri Andalas, which they say is too close to their landed homes."
11335,"In the YouTube video, a frontliner compared Malaysia‚Äôs health crisis to the outbreak in Italy last year and India this year."
11336,‚ÄúWe are already in Italy 2020.
11337,"We are already in India 2021,‚Äù she said."
11338,"‚ÄúIf you think the ship is still sailing, I think it has sunk,‚Äù said another frontliner."
11339,But true.
11340,Very true.
11341,"Well, look on the bright side."
11342,At least you're not Bulgaria with their pathetic 16% of vaccinated adults.
11343,"I have absolutely no idea wtf they're doing, but whatever it is they're doing it wrong."
11344,"If I may ask, how long were you sick from covid before being hospitalized?"
11345,I know people who died from cancer but I don‚Äôt see you out there protesting for a cure
11346,"In general, it seems like everything involving children is being glossed over with the pandemic."
11347,"It's really weird and the focus seems to be, ""who cares about the kids, how do we get adults to work?"""
11348,Of course you do lol
11349,I'm surprised it's not already required simply for liability reasons.
11350,"If a person goes into the hospital for something, contracts COVID while there and dies, and word gets out that one of the nurses caring for them transmitted it because she wasn't vaccinated... That's a potential lawsuit."
11351,The almighty dollar is revered far more than anything else in this country.
11352,I'm surprised hospitals aren't taking steps to make sure they don't have exposure to this kind of liability.
11353,I guess you don‚Äôt know anyone who died of covid.
11354,Well I do.
11355,And lots of people who lost family members.
11356,Thank you.
11357,An answer from knowledge and not speculation is all I was seeking.
11358,especially since they're likely to be around the immunocompromised who may not have effective immune responses from the vaccine and are still vulnerable

11404,"Even if it's only 1/5th the number of cases for older people than it would be without vaccines, if the spread and case numbers go up more than 5X, you get more deaths from that group than if there were no vaccines but lower case rates."

11410,That is true and undeniable.

11447,I certainly don't expect to see overloaded hospitals in area with average to above average vaccination rates.
11448,&gt; the only difference will be how many people are following along these tracks.

11464,"&gt; In every wave, as cases went up for unvaccinated people, hospitalizations and deaths went up."
11465,"I'm sure if cases go up, hospitalizations and deaths will go up by some amount."
11466,But the question is how much?
11467,"Like I said in other thread, a person 85+ is 600x more likely to die of covid than someone 18-29."
11468,And the under 18 crowd is event less vulnerable.
11469,And the vaccination rates are MUCH higher for those 65+ than those under 30.
11470,"So you'd expect the ""unvaccinated cases"" to be much much more skewed towards young people (who are less vulnerable) than what we had in a prior surge when no one was vaccinated."
11471,&gt; So why are you expecting unvaccinated people who get infected to not have hospitalizations and deaths?
11472,Because they are generally are a lot younger and healthier than the average infected person in the last surge.
11473,"I'm sure there will be some, but I expect they will be much lower ratio."
11474,25 and double pfizer am i young?
11475,the variant increases the percentage that are breakthrough cases.
11476,"Not dramatically, but it does."
11477,Lets say that that it is 75% effective at stopping infection by the Delta variant.
11478,It's not THAT unusual for a few people in a group of vaccinated people exposed to it to get it.
11479,Your group isn't just the 4 people you mentioned.
11480,"There's probably other family members, coworkers, etc that you all 4 of you have come into contact with."
11481,so it's 4 out of a larger group.
11482,"At 75% effective, we would expect that if 16 people WOULD HAVE gotten it if nobody was vaccinated, then 4 vaccinated people would get it."
11483,"You'll keep spreading the virus, it'll keep mutating and it'll never ends for all of us."

11514,I would like to know that as well.
11515,I‚Äôm also curious to know if these kids have health issues or are overweight.
11516,"Ugh, sorry."
11517,"Here is the text:

JACKSON, Miss."
11518,"(WJTV) ‚Äì With a surge in COVID-19 cases due to the Delta variant in Mississippi, health officials are encouraging people to get the COVID-19 vaccine."
11519,"In a tweet on Tuesday, State Health Officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs said there are 12 children in the ICU due to the Delta variant."
11520,Ten of them are on life support.
11521,"According to Dobbs, a majority of the COVID-19 cases in Mississippi are the Delta variant."
11522,"He said a ‚Äúvast majority‚Äù of the cases, hospitalizations and deaths are of people who have not been vaccinated."
11523,"On Tuesday, the Mississippi State Department of Health (MSDH) reported 219 new coronavirus cases and 10 additional deaths across the state."
11524,"Last week, MSDH issued new public health guidance due to the increase in COVID-19 cases."
11525,"The agency issued the following recommendations:
* Those 65 and older should avoid all indoor mass gatherings (regardless of vaccination status)
* All Mississippi residents with chronic underlying medical conditions avoid all indoor mass gatherings
* All Mississippians 12 years of age and older receive COVID vaccination
* All unimmunized wear a mask when indoors in public settings"
11526,Nobody is expecting people who *can't* to get vaccinated.
11527,"In fact, that is precisely the reason why we expect all of the *other* assholes to do so, so that even those people are protected by herd immunity."
11528,I still can't even get my first Pfizer in Australia
11529,"Well, we'll see,  won't we?"
11530,"There will be a certain schadenfreude I guess from upwards of a couple of hundred thousand 'younger people' who were desperate to party having their lives wrecked for the next decade while they suffer from long term post-viral syndrome just because freedom day had to be mid July to avoid Johnson loosing face, never mind that we have still tens of millions insufficiently protected."
11531,"I've known two friends who had post-viral syndrome - one just didn't get to university for a 3 year delay which did put him out of kilter for a while, the other got it in his mid 20s and effectively wasn't able to work full time for 8 - 10 years thereafter and that was life-changing."
11532,"But hey, right to party eh?"
11533,Myself I'm just going to bunker down two to three more months and watch the fan stuttering under the onslaught.
11534,Enjoy.
11535,"You know that this is the same for every other vaccine, right?"
11536,"[MRNA](https://ktla.com/news/local-news/booster-shots-will-likely-be-required-as-antibodies-from-covid-vaccines-wane-ucla-study/), key point - antibodies from both the vaccines and infections halve after 36 days."
11537,"This is exactly how it should work, if you retained antibodies after every single infection or vaccine then it would be a shit show."
11538,"The purpose of the vaccine is to teach your immune system how to react in ""toy"" example, not create antibodies that will last forever."
11539,"If this is misleading, just delete it."
11540,Jeez.

11543,*
11544,I read fully waxxed.
11545,In theory it should be our best shot (pun intended).
11546,Get enough people vaccinated and keep the R number below 1 for long enough that it dies out.
11547,Or show their midriffs!
11548,No shoulders no tummy‚Äôs!
11549,[removed]
11550,You and I need a fully remote job.
11551,Solidarity!
11552,What‚Äôs the outlook on the newest surge in the US?
11553,"I really just wanna be able to go to college and play sports again, I just hope so much that it doesn‚Äôt get as bad as March 2020 levels"
11554,The sad thing is that would probably work.
11555,Make fighting the virus a status symbol and everyone‚Äôs into it
11556,"Fair enough, but still true except for the lowered oxygen levels."
11557,Still potentially bedridden with what amounts to a terrible flu.
11558,What about long Covid then?
11559,Meanwhile in America...
11560,"&gt;The ‚Äúactual data‚Äù is an amalgam of the tail of NPIs, local depletion of susceptible individuals (some of which is due to vaccination), and massive reductions in testing

Testing has not been reduced, at least not in the Uk."
11561,"&gt;All signs from Europe suggest that less vaccinated states are about to get hammered

I absolutely agree, but it has nothing to do with vaccine efficacy."
11562,[removed]
11563,I also believe that the AZ vaccine still hasn't been approved by the government.
11564,So you do a sloppily administered swipe anterior nasal test in Spain and then a properly administered PCR test in Belgium .
11565,Who would have thought that pcr finds many more infections.
11566,The test is way more expensive and also way more sensitive.
11567,"&gt;I said: ""to what extent""."
11568,"Yes, and we *do* know to what extent they are working."
11569,We have data.
11570,We're talking about the UK here - they have thousands upon thousands of cases to collect data from.
11571,"Even if you want to use the word ""right"" in a legal way, rather than a philosophical one, that's not a great way to characterize rights in the US."
11572,Freedom of speech is constitutionally protected.
11573,"It would require an amendement, ratified by 3/4 of the state legislatures, to get rid of it."
11574,"It's not ""policy""."
11575,"Biden couldn't just de-prioritize, reinterpret, or abolish it."
11576,"It's not even merely a law, something a lot more rigid than policy, which congress could undo by itself."
11577,In this political climate the odds of actually ratifying an amendment are basically 0%.
11578,"And even if they weren't, calling an amendment ""policy"" would be totally inaccurate."
11579,"""Policy"" is something that the executive sets at their own discretion and the rights outlined in the Bill of Rights are just a totally separate thing."

11583,*
11584,This should mandatory for everyone everywhere (except for those who are in risk of health complications if they take the vaccine).
11585,Canada's much slower at reopening than the US
11586,"When someone asks you an honest question in a debate, People don't just freeze and reply with a fallacy."
11587,"I was asking the honest question of: ""if you do or do not trust the CDC"" so just because you don't like the question, doesn't mean I'm forcing a response or it's a false dilemma."
11588,"It means i want to understand your position, Then I was going to gauge your response to better understand your opinion, and then with you having explained why you hold that position, would have been valuable to the topic."
11589,"&gt; About the vaccines being safe: we have discovered that it has some serious side effects, miocarditis in teenagers is more likely than complications from covid for example."
11590,"I think it is still worth it for myself, but it is not the safest of all vaccines lets be honest."
11591,"&gt; 
&gt; 

Myocarditis is extremely rare (and can happen with any vaccine), far rarer than the instances of MIS-C being found in children from the Delta variant."
11592,&gt; non vaccinated people DO NOT PUT YOU AT RISK.
11593,"That is not the point, as mentioned numerous times above."
11594,"I feel safe, I'm just fine, but it isn't about me."
11595,"It's about children, the people who legitimately can't vaccinate (who are a very small number), and the healthcare system and the long-term cost of taking care of idiots who refuse to get vaccinated, catch COVID and have to deal with its effects."
11596,&gt; let others decide if they want to or not.
11597,**Other people have the choice.
11598,** They may possibly see their movement or admission to events etc limited based upon that choice **that they made.
11599,"** Nobody is saying that vaccines should be legally mandatory, but people need to take appropriate public health measures if they want to be involved in regular society."
11600,"That may mean being shut out of restaurants etc, it may mean having their travel to other countries/regions limited because they can spread the virus, it may mean their employer making it mandatory for them to get vaccinated because otherwise they are endangering those around them (health care workers for example)."
11601,If they don't like it: tough shit.
11602,Get vaccinated.
11603,It's easy and free.
11604,"They can live the rest of their life being an ignorant dipshit if they want to, that's their business, but they don't have the inherent right to be treated like they aren't one."
11605,Good.
11606,I hope they also gave the person a massive fine.
11607,Make fraudsters who can literally infect you with COVID and kill you - pay pay pay with freedom and money.
11608,The punishment should be calculated based on what could / can still happen.
11609,Everyone I've heard say that had a whole list of excuses queued up and the FDA approval was just one of many.
11610,Then they start in on the victimhood of all the things the government is going to do to them because they're not vaccinated but they're going to do what is right for their family no matter the cost.
11611,"It doesn‚Äôt contain stem cells, but stem cells were absolutely used in its development."
11612,"It‚Äôd be like a vegan refusing to use certain skin care products if they test on animals, and you retorting ‚ÄúYou dumbass, that lipstick doesn‚Äôt even contain animals!‚Äù"
11613,A study of SIX!!!
11614,What is this bullshit and why is this even an article!
11615,"&gt;CDC says roughly 4,100 people have been hospitalized or died with Covid breakthrough infections after vaccination

."
11616,"&gt;Israel says the Delta variant is infecting vaccinated people, representing as many as 50% of new cases."
11617,Being vaccinated doesn't mean you won't get sick.
11618,It does generally mean that you won't be hospitalized or die.
11619,I'm thinking that this explains the downvotes... but reddit.
11620,Who knows.
11621,"americans are a freedom loving, tough as nails group."
11622,they wouldn't stand for many restrictions.
11623,just look at the BLM protests last spring during the height of pandemic deaths.
11624,nobody was worried about the virus.

11629,"(Where we went from 500 to 10000 cases a day in a week in our tiny country, mostly Delta variant, because our Government basically said *YOLO!"
11630,*
11631,It would.
11632,"They approved some drugs that cause horrible, lasting side effects or even deaths."
11633,Some of the drugs are still on the market and nobody cares.
11634,So...
11635,Last I had read China was actually telling some local city governments that were pushing mandatory vaccinations to back off and apologize for it.
11636,[removed]
11637,They don't want to be saved!
11638,"Why do we have to force it on them, it is up to them to have it or not, let them be."
11639,"Non vaccinated people are not a risk to anyone but themselves, it is their body and their choice, and you must respect that."
11640,It sucks how right you are.
11641,The American people were waiting.
11642,"And 400,000 people died before we got EUA."
11643,I‚Äôm not saying produce a vaccine and perform no testing.
11644,Nor am I saying roll it out to all mankind.
11645,But a faster track than what we have for select at risk people for a global crisis.
11646,1 year is way to long for an effective response for a worst case scenario.
11647,"I‚Äôm willing to bet that not a single vaccine in the US, that has made it to human trials, has killed 50% of its participants."
11648,Imagine a scenario where a virus comes out that is infectious and lethal where 75% of mankind is wiped out while we are confirming what side effects might afflict a small percent of people.
11649,Having a safe virus but too late is also unacceptable.
11650,A safe and a timely response are both equally important
11651,Wouldn't change anyone's minds unfortunately.
11652,"Unless they live truly in the middle of nowhere, any able-bodied adult can easily go and get the vaccine today."
11653,"At this point, if someone hasn't gotten it, it's on them."
11654,Even if it got full FDA approval it would still have the Bill Gates mind control nanobots and it would destroy your sperm and eggs and break down your DNA and make Coke taste like Pepsi and make it impossible for you to win the lottery.
11655,"You will need to be vaccinated or have a negative test to use bars, restaurants and shopping centres etc."
11656,from August.
11657,Coworker of mine got it on their honeymoon.
11658,Old enough to know better.
11659,Got their new spouse sick who happened to be vaccinated.
11660,"Was scared to get vaccine cause of the ‚Äúdangerous‚Äùspike protein, So they elected to get the wild protein lol 

They weren‚Äôt scared of the experimental antibodies and antiviral treatments though when their doctor got them the infusion."
11661,I wish they‚Äôd make it mandatory.
11662,I‚Äôm sick of dealing with the general public who aren‚Äôt vaccinated and even in our area the numbers are climbing again.
11663,I despise working close quarters with fellow health care workers who refuse to get the shots.
11664,Make it mandatory
11665,"Oh shit I never knew that, even as a lifelong acetaminophen user"
11666,You are correct.
11667,"If it doesn't get approved, and we have another pandemic like this, nobody will trust the vaccine until full approval, and still an if at that."
11668,"Even if it isn't safe enough for full approval when it comes time for that decision, politics will come into play."
11669,Fauci and everyone else will lose all credibility if the FDA says they can't give the vaccines full approval.
11670,"the vaccine does not stop infections, it is ~50% effective on stopping infection, so you all infect other people just like non vaccinated people, but with half the probability."
11671,"But it is 97% effective at stopping deaths and serious complications, just look at UK, cases go up, deaths do not."
11672,Looking at the data from 1 year ago when there were no vaccines makes no sense.
11673,"About the vaccines being safe: we have discovered that it has some serious side effects, miocarditis in teenagers  is more likely than complications from covid for example."
11674,"I think it is still worth it for myself, but it is not the safest of all vaccines lets be honest."
11675,"If you lose patience trying to convince people of something, you give up, because we are all free to think differently, and as shown on my statements above, non vaccinated people DO NOT PUT YOU AT RISK."
11676,"The virus is around us and will be, deal with it, if people don't want to vaccine so be it, you are safe, let others decide if they want to or not."
11677,0 need to impose anything on anyone
11678,Nothing will change.
11679,"We are now at a point where over 99% of Covid deaths are unvaccinated people and they still won't get vaccinated because ""that's fer libruls"""
11680,Delta in the Delta
11681,My arm was just sore and my lymph nodes swelled a little for a few days but that was it
11682,Sad too if the kids weren‚Äôt yet eligible to receive the vaccine.
11683,that shit fucked me up fam
11684,"**Tougher in France, definitely**."
11685,"And before moving I was on the phone on a daily basis with a friend there, comparing our two countries restrictions..."
11686,"I cannot understand why people in the US were complaining, and how they could argue that their freedom was under attack."
11687,EDIT: had to rephrase
11688,We need 11+under EUA as soon as safely possible
11689,Looking forward for bad faith trolls having one BS line to post in forums
11690,"Fauci‚Äôs been saying since May 2020 Zero Covid isn‚Äôt happening, and that was back when majority of US states were still doing public health measures, so I‚Äôm pretty confident that Covid is not gonna be eradicated anytime soon, even if they scared the whole population into treating the Delta Variant like a new pandemic."
11691,We don‚Äôt have high expectations of Mississippi in any other respect.
11692,Why should this be any different?
11693,"Yup, I get what you're saying."
11694,I hope the supply situation improves soon!
11695,"I hope so, too."
11696,And it's ok!
11697,üòä
11698,Fauci has already said after yesterdays private meeting with Pfizer that nothing has changed and as of right now there is no booster shot needed.
11699,Cuomo‚Äôs comments about not accepting federal emergency approval of a vaccine is a good start.
11700,Listen I‚Äôm a democrat or I think that I am.
11701,Both sides push the other guy is evil to further this populist agenda.
11702,We don‚Äôt have to stay entrenched forever capitalism has merits but there‚Äôs no reason we can‚Äôt provide healthcare for everyone.
11703,It‚Äôs 2/week.
11704,They tried 4 but even they figured it wasn‚Äôt going to work.
11705,Also have flex.
11706,We literally have a contingency plan to be able to work from home for situations just like this.
11707,We are 100% capable and have stress tested every system for years.
11708,This past year and a half proved it‚Äôs doable.
11709,"For unrelated reasons, I went in to work for a week and we have reasonable safety measures in place,but it only works because the building is at 10% capacity at most."
11710,"My cube neighbor has been working in office for some time now by choice and surprise, not vaxed."
11711,This was preventable.
11712,I'm not sure what to think about comments like these.
11713,What are we supposed to do?
11714,Worry about it more?
11715,Anecdotal but heard from a nurse this weekend that all the rural hospitals in my state are on divert because they are at capacity with covid patients.
11716,Feels like they are trying to move towards a for-profit model
11717,Did you actually even read the article you posted.
11718,God damnit the internet is so stupid.
11719,If it does get approved then what will anti-vaxxers argue?
11720,I‚Äôm so tired of hearing ‚ÄúbUt It‚ÄôS nOt FdA aPpRoVeD!‚Äù I pray to god it gets approved
11721,"I appreciate that view, but for me at least, wearing a mask when I'm inside a building with people I don't know their vaccination status is not altering my lifestyle."
11722,"Hell, my bra is more uncomfortable than a mask."
11723,"It's such a small thing, and if it could save a life, why not?"
11724,The simple answer is that as of right now the FDA has only found a link between J&amp;J and GBS.
11725,"I'm right there with you, I knew it was dangerous, but no idea how low the bar is."
11726,I think the problem with messaging is that the warnings on acetaminophen read just like the warnings on any number of other over-the-counter medications that aren't nearly as dangerous.
11727,"Well, it paid off."

11732,Yes and that's what I'm saying.

11734,"Gottlieb is mostly trustworthy as an expert but since he‚Äôs a Pfizer board member and has a financial interest in boosters, I‚Äôd wait to hear what Fauci and even Walensky have to say before getting on the bandwagon that they‚Äôre needed."
11735,Thanks for the excerpt.
11736,Annexin A2 is a protein that your body produces that has a bunch of roles.
11737,"In the lungs, the important roles seem to be to help prevent blood clots, maintain lung elasticity, aid in cell membrane repair, and help maintain integrity of blood vessels."
11738,"This paper suggests that, at least in some people, coronavirus infection can trigger the production of antibodies that target and destroy Annexin A2 (i.e."
11739,an auto-immune response).
11740,When Annexin A2 is destroyed it leads to greater lung damage that can cause death.
11741,The authors propose that looking for Annexin A2 antibodies could be a way of predicting if someone may be likely to have more severe covid symptoms.
11742,the huge problem is that here in the US there's a large % that won't take the shot!
11743,These ppl in effect are letting covid &amp; its variants continue on for the next several years until it becomes endemic.
11744,It's basically like gun violence to them: close your eyes and you won't see any problem.
11745,"The sad fact is that just like certain parts of the world are known for malaria, the US will be grappling with covid for a very long time."
11746,"I bet that in a couple years travelers to the US will have to take covid ""pills"" to prevent contracting the disease."

11751,I wish the could record it and broadcast it all over for people to witness
11752,It's not exactly convenient.
11753,Name one democrat - one - who has politicized vaccinations.
11754,This both sides crap has got to stop.
11755,Only  Republicans have politicized vaccinations and by that I mean telling people to not get them.
11756,"They are firing officials for reporting data, clapping for people who refuse them and actively rejecting science that would keep people safe."
11757,[deleted]
11758,"&gt; and it gets reported here too

I think people forget just how many people there are on social media (including reddit as ""social media"" here)."
11759,"If there are 100,000 cases of covid in a week and 1% of those are breakthrough cases, thats 1,000 people - many of whom will rush to their social media pages and post about how they got covid despite being vaccinated."
11760,Then those posts get amplified by  others with their own agenda.
11761,"It can easily seem like these breakthrough cases are super common and we are in deep trouble, when in reality the vaccines are working exactly as advertised."
11762,Those articles just talk about cases not hospitalization and death.
11763,"Also I agree that deaths will rise, just not nearly as much as they have in previous waves."
11764,20 case/day INCREASE.
11765,"I said ""up 20 cases/day"""
11766,"Not a good sign, I wonder how things will look in winter when people are typically clustered together indoors"
11767,So judging by the lack of reply was my prediction on point?
11768,You were in fact going to try to work through the hypothetical to try to tie it back to what happened despite the fact that I already pre-empted how that would work?
11769,But if you're only going into the hypothetical as a thought exercise: I would charge him with whatever people get charged with for a building flaw causes deaths due to late inspection.
11770,I don't know how the law always handles that.

11772,I remember when FEMA sent trailer morgues to Texas last year.
11773,Looks like they might have to do so again.

11775,that smells like politics where politics shouldn't exist
11776,"unfortunately, the locales where Delta is surging is exactly those places that dropped the mask mandate as soon as the winter surge was over."
11777,These states and their residents simply don't care about sickness &amp; death in their own communities.
11778,"Places like Los Angeles which still recommend masking indoors, have a majority of their populace masking inside anyway, mandates or not."
11779,"As a mother this breaks my heart, but I hope it will be a wakeup call for some of the parents in Mississippi who have been cavalier about the virus."
11780,It's terrible that this is what it will take for some of them - and some still won't care.
11781,This is a good way of seeing it.
11782,The only thing I can change is my own worrying.
11783,"I‚Äôm not particularly worried about COVID, but I am worried I‚Äôll never have my life from 2019 back again, ever."

11801,I'm just not so sure that's the case.
11802,The amount of explosive case growth seen in Israel and the UK show us that vaccines help prevent death and serious disease but offer negligible benefit for mild to moderate and don't really completely stamp out the spread in the ways we hope.

11805,"Because the two shots will be enough immunity against Delta, but the Delta variant is infectious and different enough that your body needs a higher level of antibodies to keep you from getting symptoms."
11806,"The antibodies begin to wane around the 6 month mark and no longer have the headroom needed to provide a full barrier to the Delta variant, as shown by the data in Israel."
11807,You should have relatively good protection against the Delta variant well into the fall after your second shot.
11808,Unfortunately the antivaxxers are throwing a wrench in herd immunity and slowing the process down and making future shots necessary.

11830,How can you assume every person at a school is low risk?
11831,There isn't really a bigger germ factory.
11832,Exactly.
11833,"In my case, rightfully so- my vaccine didn't work because of my MS medication and 2 of my kids are too young to get it and 1 has chronic asthma."
11834,It's extremely frustrating for us.
11835,I did it
11836,Uh‚Ä¶ long covid?
11837,"&gt;so will malls, caf√©s, cinemas, theatres, concerts etc."
11838,No.

11851,It's not much but it's enough to put the fear of god into me.
11852,I don't know if I'm being selfish or everyone else is but I'm so frustrated with seeing everyone just throw caution to the wind.
11853,"According to the Office for National Statistics, in the week to the 4th July the highest incidence of hospitalisation was by far among those aged over 75 years of age: just about all people of that age have been vaccinated."
11854,"When you look at the age groups who have not been fully vaccinated, i.e."
11855,"under 35, comparatively very few people in that age group are being hospitalised or losing their lives."
11856,"Given all of this, I think you can make a case to say the majority of people in hospital will have been vaccinated."
11857,"But, no one is sure how many people go into hospital for a completely unrelated illness and contract the virus while in there and are recorded as 'hospitalised with covid': let's just say the general consensus is that since the pandemic began the numbers involved have been significant."
11858,Would you expect anything different?
11859,"Younger people were not being hospitalised or losing their lives in significant numbers, nowhere near comparable to older age groups, without a vaccine; and it has never been claimed that a vaccine can save all of those people in older age groups contracting the virus."
11860,The point of the vaccine is to limit the damage among those more at risk of being seriously ill.
11861,"So far, it looks to be working given that the rate of hospitalisations and loss of life has not followed the positive cases trajectory."
11862,"That said, we are seeing an increase in hospitalisations, and so I think the jury is still out on just how effective the vaccines will turn out to be."
11863,I‚Äôm in Korea right now and my family members are having trouble signing up for Moderna.

11867,You‚Äôve probably killed several people indirectly every single flu season since you‚Äôve been alive.
11868,Why did you never wear a mask during flu season?

11870,You people are tiresome.

11885,This is such a good news and a bad news at the same time.
11886,"The shortage of AZ is due to COVAX, who decided to give priority to low-income countries."
11887,"Canada, Germany, and Spain are already mixing AZ with m-RNA vaccines, so there is nothing laughable."
11888,SK also raised the age limit of AZ to 50 years old so mixing is inevitable.
11889,And the vaccination schedule is 70% with one shot by September and 70% fully vaccinated by November.
11890,"The schedule is supposed to be shortened, not delayed."
11891,It‚Äôs funny because I won‚Äôt watch it and I know many people that are t going to watch it either.
11892,This may not be popular to say.
11893,Judging just from the article: reduced exercise capacity and fatigue were the most common?
11894,77.1% of Covid patients reported these symptoms?
11895,"Does anyone cite that the CDC reports that 78% of Covid patients are obese and overweight (which fatigue and reduced exercise capacity, even concentration, are symptoms)?"

Shouldn‚Äôt this be a relevant factor based on CDC data?"
11897,"If you don‚Äôt have your own children, you have a lot of nerve assuming parents are just ok with throwing their kids in a completely unmasked high population environment and allowing them to get or not get Covid because it will likely not hurt them."
11898,Some kids do get long Covid and sorry if a lot of us feel that mask wearing and social distancing is a small price to pay for kids to safely interact with each other while waiting a few more months (September/October) to have the chance to get vaccinated.
11899,I am so sorry to hear this!
11900,I truly hope he begins to recover soon.
11901,"Well, masks and social distancing work especially when paired with a mostly effective vaccine."
11902,Unless you‚Äôd rather lockdown?
11903,"It‚Äôll feel like forever because no one wants to be accountable and take personal responsibility so this will keep happening

11928,The Delta variant poses zero threat.
11929,If everybody are vaccinated then everybody hospitalised is vaccinated.
11930,The majority of adults in both countries are fully vaccinated and only a minority isn't primarily the youngest part of the population.
11931,So if 10 are hospitalised and 5 have been fully vaccinated and 5 haven't then the 5 fully vaccinated is out of a group that consists of 70% of the population the 5 unvaccinated out of the last 30%.
11932,In percentage more unvaccinated is therefore hospitalised.
11933,Also remember that as you get older your immune system doesn't work as well and the vaccines can't get your body to produce the same immune response as in an younger person.
11934,Because of high uptake.

12039,"In terms of infections and the Delta variant, it may be more like 3 or 4 to 1."
12040,What that means is that rising cases among the unvaccinated mean more cases for the vaccinated.
12041,"Rationally, vaccinated people SHOULD want fewer unvaccinated people to get it."
12042,"Not to mention that outside the US, getting the vaccine can be more difficult."
12043,"I‚Äôm getting my second dose later this week, but there was absolutely no way for me to get it any earlier, at least in Canada."
12044,"In other countries, some people are still waiting for eligibility for the first dose; I understand this to be an issue in Mexico."
12045,[removed]
12046,Maybe you need to read more on what‚Äôs been happening with delta in Sydney then.
12047,"There was one case where someone caught it from someone just in passing, that‚Äôs the only place they had contact."
12048,And  yes they know that‚Äôs where it came from because of sequencing and the low numbers (zero) in the community.
12049,You don‚Äôt seem to understand that it‚Äôs very different circumstances in other places and they‚Äôve been able to figure this out.
12050,[removed]
12051,Because the developing world doesn't pay as well.
12052,I'd say probably not any more often than you did to prevent spreading the cold or flu.
12053,That seems to be roughly the danger level we're talking about for vaccinated individuals.

Lol"
12059,It's not mandatory anywhere.
12060,It's recommended or some places have it in their policy to get it.
12061,"But by law, it's not."
12062,So yeah it previously wasn't anywhere until now.
12063,Exactly how I feel.
12064,Any data for Delta death rate and icu rate?
12065,Belgium better get them Spain tests
12066,"Wait until you see the UK open or restrictions on the 19th this month...
Be interesting to see us handle Brexit, Covid, the already terrible crony government on top of losing the Euro cup!"
12067,Definitely moral beaters there.
12068,Been an terrible couple years for sure.
12069,This... lots of people are just lazy fucks.
12070,All you have to do is make it more inconvenient to *not* be vaccinated and they'll suddenly find the time and will to go get it.
12071,I still think the slow start coupled with the proximity to the US and their early availability of vaccines helped with our uptake.
12072,"There was lots of FOMO about vaccines early one so when they finally became available en masse, people jumped at the chance."
12073,I only see that happening in places where the vaccination rates are low.
12074,Not necessarily in areas where it's not.
12075,"For instance, in my hometown of Highland Park, 80% of the adults AND 12 year old kids so far (separately) both have had their first vaccinations."
12076,That's a REALLY huge number.
12077,"As someone who's lived there my whole life, I am moved to see that many who are vaccinated."
12078,"https://web.archive.org/web/20210602095146/https://www.thestandard.com.hk/breaking-news/section/4/173622/Twelve-died-last-week-after-Covid-vaccination,-four-suffered-miscarriages"
12079,"The UK is still behind on the those who want it, can get it."
12080,"It's only in the last few weeks that it's opened up to anyone, and it's still adult based as well."
12081,ie 18 and over.
12082,"Plus what we've found in our family is that my mum and dad were prioritised (over 70, plus dad being a stem cell recipient ie shielding category)."
12083,So they've both had 2 doses.
12084,"However research is showing that it could be that dad has no antibodies, or not enough to protect him."
12085,Could/is also applicable to solid organ recipients as well.
12086,These were some of the first who were vaccinated to protect them.
12087,"So they could be vulnerable again, and I honestly can't see the UK doing lock down v4 with out huge riots and dissent."
12088,Those who suffered to save the vulnerable will suffer again from those who just don't care.
12089,With the slowness of routine medical care right now (because of all the catching up to do and GP appointments/nurse appointments being so reduced) it could be a couple months before he's tested to find out if he's still vulnerable.

12318,But if the cases are mostly in unvaccinated people... why should the unvaccinated people who are infected have protection from hospitalization?

12349,It's not really the vaccine passport that people have an issue with; it's how they were introduced.
12350,"At least in Germany, the government started rolling out the ""passport"" system in April, *long* before the average Joe was allowed to be vaccinated (""passport"" in quotes; it was mostly that people who are vaccinated get exempted from certain things, like needing a negative COVID test or counting as a person in private gatherings)."
12351,"Now that everyone is starting to get vaccinated, everyone is totally cool with the passport system."
12352,"In fact, most people think it's a great idea."
12353,As you do in China.
12354,"They don't practice literal slave labor over there, even if working conditions are not always ideal or as safe as in the US."
12355,"Most families in China earn enough to pay for the schools their children qualify for as far as I know, and public schools for those who can't afford the more prestigious ones."
12356,"While the schooling system is ridiculously over emphasized in importance, it does guarantee better jobs the better you do well, even at public colleges."
12357,"Whereas in the west increasingly, it doesn't matter how good your degree is unless you go to an Ivy League college, and even then there are no guarantees."
12358,I travel a decent amount in PA/NJ/NY/DC/MA regions and most places I go to I see no masks anymore strange your county is different then all the surrounding areas.
12359,What a waste.
12360,It's more important to leadership to score political points than it is to keep its residents safe.
12361,It's disgusting
12362,Oh believe me I‚Äôve had my shots since day one and wish the government was doing so much more to mandate vaccines.
12363,"It‚Äôs not necessarily the existence of masks that pisses me off and makes me sad, it‚Äôs the idea that despite doing MY PART (staying at home or very limited gathering for a year until my shot, always wear a mask, get my vaccine), I still have to indefinitely take precautions, which pisses me off and, in my opinion, gives legitimacy to the ‚Äúwho cares about all this if it will never end‚Äù argument that we all laughed at even a month ago."
12364,"In Texas I noticed especially in places like in the rural areas, when we had about 35% of Texas vaccinated, go into any Walmart and suddenly 100% of everyone is vaccinated (even 5-year olds)"
12365,Except it wouldn't even be funny.

12371,&gt; antibodies is likely all gone within a year.
12372,That's why Pfizer want to give booster to people after six or seven months.
12373,"I just would like to ask a follow-up question on this, so, do you mean it's like a third shot (and fourth and then say, it's done) or do you mean it's closer more like a booster every year type-thing?"
12374,Because I don't see how in the next 2-3 years world governments can solve this globally if we need booster very year?
12375,[removed]
12376,there's high potential that this could be essentially over in the US if people would have 1. worn masks and 2. gotten vaccinated as soon as possible.
12377,"the longer people refrain from doing those things, the longer it will be until we don't have to talk about this anymore."
12378,Same with middle and high schools.
12379,Many parents won‚Äôt vaccinate their older children.
12380,The situation could be worse at the secondary level.
12381,Same here in UT.
12382,Makes me sad.
12383,Username checks out.
12384,Agreed
12385,France is using the European standard like the rest of the UE.
12386,Iirc it‚Äôs signed using a digital certificate.
12387,There is.
12388,You endanger others by not being vaccinated and use up resources which are sourced solidary.
12389,I caught it too.
12390,it wasn't a big deal for me either.
12391,hearing more and more cases like yours - which is starting to make me think the vaccines don't work or are perhaps something else - the question is what...
12392,[removed]
12393,Unfortunately that may never happen so I‚Äôm taking what I can get.
12394,"If the bullet hits your chest just right, the impact could stop your heart and kill you."
12395,But there's a very low chance of that happening versus the 99% chance you die from a bullet straight through the heart.
12396,Findings like this really make me wonder if I'll ever feel comfortable as a vaccinated person at the live concerts I love so much.
12397,"Considering that those often have tens of thousands of people attending, who are also singing, screaming, cheering, etc."
12398,while packed into a tight space (especially if standing in the pit in front of the stage rather than using an assigned seating plan).
12399,"I'm hopeful because large concerts are starting to happen again, but it's hard for me to feel excited about returning to them."
12400,I think it has something to do with the higher dose compared to Pfizer but I could be wrong.
12401,Why can't someone stand out and make a statement that you can still catch and spread the virus even if you are vaccinated?
12402,Majority of the people thought vaccination prevents you from getting infected.
12403,[deleted]
12404,"Second doses won't be ""done"" by end of this month."
12405,My second dose is booked for late August.
12406,"I got my first dose in early June as I am a healthy 31 year old who was quarantining and isolating at home for all of May and June because my dad died of COVID in late April and I wanted to be as little part of the problem as I possibly could, but at the same time, leaving as many vaccines possible for those who need them more than me."
12407,"I figured by early June I was good to go get my first dose, anyone who needed it more than me had ample time and supply to get it done."
12408,"I purposely delayed my second dose (well, originally it was set for late September, but once they allowed it after 8 weeks) to a little bit later, mid - late August, as I think this will give best immune response going into the fall and winter, when COVID is at its worst (hopefully not all THAT bad this year, with so many fully vaccinated people, but still, whatever uptick we see, I'd like to know that I have maximum protection during that uptick, not during the summer, when there is virtually no COVID to be worried about anyways."
12409,I'm thinking of taxes and whatever fees/costs you pay to any State Owned Enterprises.
12410,"Like say you rent an apartment, which is on government land, made with government steel, and government cement."
12411,They're doing something with the money sure.
12412,But they're also putting it in their own pocket or make themselves owners to reap the profit.
12413,We have public transport here...
12414,[deleted]
12415,"Interestingly, the linked article quotes a researcher who says they'll be publishing a paper showing ""much reduced"" risk of long covid among people who are double vaccinated."
12416,"I kind of wish she'd said ""virtually eliminated"" or something, since ""much reduced"" might just mean, like, a 50% decrease."
12417,But at least it's something.
12418,I'd be interested to see if the vaccine decreases the severity or duration of long covid.
12419,"I've had lingering side effects after a serious respiratory infection and basically life-long neurological damage from Lyme disease - but the respiratory side effects resolved over a few weeks, so that was okay, and the Lyme side-effects are minor, so that's also okay."
12420,"""Short"" long covid or ""incredibly minor long covid"" would be a big improvement on what we've got now."
12421,"Careful now, this sub loves to remove people who use the Korl Morx words"
12422,mask wearing for staff probably helped to reduce spread but for mask wearing for children it's another matter.
12423,We can pick and choose stats and studies all we want.
12424,Oster's study has huge sample sizes and is peer reviewed and published.
12425,you can't deny that the evidence is inconclusive.
12426,"Lol it's literally your anecdotal opinion versus mine, that's not the case for the province I live in"
12427,you know those dye tablets you give kids to chew so they can see where the plaque is so they brush properly?
12428,i wish we had something like that but for adults so they can see how many germs they breathe in.
12429,They believe in a very twisted version of personal responsibility that neglects the fact that *we live in a society*
12430,Sounds like you found the right soap.
12431,Well done.
12432,Are breakthrough infections happening more frequently in the ultra-orthodox communities or is the incidence of breakthrough infections pretty uniform across all groups in Israel?
12433,"While I agree with most of what you‚Äôre saying, I completely disagree with lumping *all* of the unvaccinated into the group of those who do not take them."
12434,Often overlooked are the children younger than 12 years old who cannot receive the vaccine.
12435,"It is my responsibility to ensure my infant child does not get COVID, and I am doing so by being vaccinated, masking up, and limiting my exposure."
12436,I refuse to be a vector for this virus.
12437,The conspiracy shit heads still think that wearing a mask kills you.
12438,Mask mandates don't work in the USA because a certain segment of the population is barely trainable
12439,"&gt;We HAVE to leave the decision to the parents, for good and bad."
12440,"Well, that depends on how we view children."
12441,"Are children strictly the property of their parents or are children citizens in their own right, deserving of protections and rights to them individually?"
12442,Can a parent refuse medical treatment that will result in a child‚Äôs death or permanent disability?
12443,Can a sexually mature child make their own reproductive choices?
12444,"In general, children are under the authority of their parents, but their own rights come into play when dealing with medical issues that will be their responsibility long into adulthood (like having a baby or maintaining the basic functionality of their body)."
12445,A blanket policy of parental authority with no caveats or considerations reduces children to nothing more than objects.
12446,"Maybe in the province where you are, but not where I am."
12447,"Its still going to take several weeks for hospitalizations to tick up, to one degree or another, after cases are found, with or without vaccines."
12448,"Likely 90% or more of hospitalizations will be unvaccinated people who get it, and 99.5% of deaths a few weeks after that will be unvaccinated people."
12449,"What changes is the total number of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths (all lower) with vaccines in majority of arms."
12450,"But the time it takes for COVID to progress from ""I feel sick and think it may be COVID so I'm getting a test"" to ""I feel really sick and think I need a hospital now"" to ""I'm dead"" will all still be a few weeks apart, with 0% vaccinated or 90% vaccinated, the only difference will be how many people are following along these tracks."
12451,This should be easy for anyone to understand really..
12452,I‚Äôve lived in Wyoming for 2 years for work.
12453,I‚Äôm finally moving in early August- right after Wyoming hosts the biggest rodeo in our state that will be comparable to last years Mardi Gras super spreading event.
12454,Can‚Äôt wait to get out of here.
12455,"Wyoming is only 30% vaccinated as a state, and yet our covid cases are about 10x worse now than they were at this point last year."
12456,God help the west.
12457,I mean at this point the vaccines have fewer side effects than birth control pills if you put the two of them head to head.
12458,I'd be extremely surprised they were not given full approval.

12466,I'm sorry you and your wife are going thru this.
12467,My best to you both.
12468,Oxygen levels above 95% are not going to cause brain fog.
12469,It is likely due to covid's neuro-invasive nature - meaning the virus itself can invade the brain and nearby nerves.
12470,"For example, loss of smell indicates a neuro invasion because the nerves that are responsible for smell are in direct connection with brain."
12471,"A broke ass, ghetto vaccine that nobody trusts and no one will take."
12472,Nice!
12473,Yeah I definitely think masks helped with my dad.
12474,"He got it from his boss at work, but was working in close quarters for him for a few hours, not sure if his boss had a mask on."
12475,"Him and my stepmom live together tho and obvi share a bed and stuff so while she did get it worse than him, it still wasn't bad."
12476,Then you have my stepsister who lived with them the whole time and never got it!
12477,"She stayed in her room and wore masks around them for the most part but even so, same house!"
12478,So weird.
12479,But yeah it's really unfortunate about Delta.
12480,"Def makes me a bit nervous, even being fully vaccinated"
12481,I hate ppl with this logic.
12482,"The way humans had to do it before vaccinations, which was the virus infecting as many people as possible, and the population building immunity from it."
12483,"yeah, some people have an idea that the vaccine is like an invisible shield that stops any particles from entering your system."
12484,"if you are exposed and vaccinated you still get the virus, how your body responds to it depends on how much of an immune response you had to the vaccine."
12485,"if it was good, you should be able to stop the virus in it's tracks."
12486,"if it wasn't as good, your body may bet sick in response to fighting the virus as it multiplies."
12487,fortunately you had a head start with the vaccine so most likely you will only suffer a short and lighter illness as you body fights it much more efficiently than if you had never had the vaccine and had a response ready to go.
12488,I got vaxxxes
12489,"In the COVID vaccinated sub, there were someone who had issues with mRNA vaccines that were advised to get J&amp;J as a second dose."
12490,Maybe check with your doctor?
12491,What‚Äôs another route?
12492,You're going to have to define wealthy then.
12493,There are millions of families paying child care that few would call wealthy.
12494,There are also programs for families with qualifying incomes to receive a good amount of assistance.
12495,"Even if 100 percent of human transmission was stopped, it would not be possible to eradicate it because it's got animal reservoirs."

12527,I defend it when I think it's worth defending.
12528,I do the same with US or any other party.

12542,The second last quote highlighted notes this.
12543,"Could literally paste the whole article, but here‚Äôs the article‚Äôs counter."
12544,"&gt;RDIF added that the vaccine is registered in more than 60 countries and that studies from places including Argentina, Mexico and Hungary that are already using the vaccine show it is safe and effective."
12545,"It said there had been ‚Äúno reported serious adverse events.‚Äù

&gt;On the French delegation‚Äôs findings, RDIF said ‚Äúthe Sputnik V cell bank is fully compliant with all EMA requirements.‚Äù

&gt;RDIF said it is working closely with the EMA, whose inspectors have visited Sputnik V production facilities."
12546,"‚ÄúFrom the inspections already completed we‚Äôve received no major critical comments and none of the issues raised doubted the safety and efficacy of the vaccine,‚Äù said RDIF."
12547,&gt;One of the people with knowledge of European efforts to assess the drug said they had no reason to doubt that Sputnik is a safe and effective vaccine.
12548,A study by international scientists published in the Lancet in February found Sputnik to be more than 90% effective.

12577,But s this really because we suspect that Covishield is inefficient or rather because the EMA has very high hygiene standards to make vaccination even safer?
12578,I suspect it's the latter and then it doesn't make sense to ban people that have already survived their vaccination and have the same protection that people have that have the same vaccine produced by AstraZeneca.

12640,long time no see!
12641,glad to have you back!
12642,Everyone is at risk.
12643,The vaccine reduces greatly the chances of hospitalization or death.
12644,You can still get sick.
12645,You can still transmit.
12646,You can still suffer long-haul COVID.
12647,You can still suffer permanent organ and nerve damage.
12648,"In simple terms: don't be stupid, get vaccinated; don't be stupid, wear a mask."
12649,Maintaining high production quality is at least as important.
12650,"If anyone could manufacture any vaccine, how do you ensure it's not tainted or incorrectly produced?"
12651,There is far more nuance to this discussion than you are either aware of or want to admit.
12652,Up to their old tricks.
12653,They used to make up numbers all the time to push the Party's narrative.
12654,Exactly.
12655,All bets are off one minute after the votes have been counted in September.
12656,"Yes, but even a non severe case is nothing to be sneezed at."
12657,[removed]
12658,[deleted]
12659,what a stupid response.
12660,"They care about IP more than protecting billions of people, and the millions of deaths so far, because waiving the patent would ''stifle innovation''."
12661,Are you seriously defending this?
12662,"Actually, I don't really want you to respond so much, you're pretty fucking dense and won't want to get off your high horse because Canada donated 18 million doses instead of doing the BARE MINIMUM that can help get all of us out of this fucking mess."
12663,no one needs a reminder of the way things are.
12664,it's pretty apparent and it needs to change.
12665,Fully vaccinated people can still catch COVID and develop mild symptoms.
12666,Some just don‚Äôt want that.
12667,I personally will probably wear masks forever in crowded places like public transportation for the same reason: I don‚Äôt want to get sick.
12668,Canada doesn't own the patent so no they can't
12669,Good shout.
12670,So I just search low-histamine diet?
12671,My histamine levels are quite high usually especially this time of year so it may be very beneficial.
12672,I aid this before.
12673,Offer incentive.
12674,Euro to people who are/will get vaccinated.
12675,This would definitely increase vaccinated.
12676,Yes not 100% buy mandatory may result in violence
12677,[removed]
12678,"How do you know you had it again, were you tested?"
12679,Well that is a huge revelation.
12680,Is there even an estimated date?
12681,Some good news out of California.
12682,The question is whether they'll just talk about this policy or actually enforce it.
12683,"Because it's not a guarantee, or overly protective."
12684,"Asking society to go back to Alpha days is not going to happen economically, or emotionally."
12685,"People have had it, and will refuse."
12686,You watch.
12687,"Not to be a downer, but the Netherlands did just experience a 500% rise in cases in a week after dropping restrictions: https://www.dutchnews.nl/news/2021/07/surge-in-coronavirus-cases-may-be-slowing-down-14-5-of-tests-positive/

(The article is upbeat, they're down to 500% from an earlier 800%)"
12688,So then is it just better if they did nothing?
12689,Some people are just never happy no matter what the outcome is...
12690,Thanks for making me laugh in this thread of sadness.
12691,You're under the assumption that someone that has been vaccinated will quarantine them selves if they get a sore throat.
12692,What will happen instead is that they will have a pass to go everywhere and infect other people.
12693,That's by design though.
12694,We have intentionally not taken the US strategy of creating a two-tier society where the focus is on individual rights instead of the collective good.
12695,Canada will re-open when it's safe to do so as a society; we don't prioritize letting a minority of people start throwing big parties just because.
12696,And it's proven to work since our case counts are microscopic and continuing to drop despite Delta being the dominant strain.
12697,Thank you.

12701,"After a year and a half it's painfully obvious that the people who will alter their lives a little for safety of everyone have been doing so since the start and will continue as necessary, and those that won't and haven't will not start any time soon for any reason."
12702,"It's sick and depressing *how many* sociopaths are out there, but at least we can see them clearly now."
12703,Silver linings and all that.
12704,"I understand what you're trying to say, but at a certain point you have to accept that maybe some of your actions will potentially have a negative impact on others' lives, however unlikely that may be, whether you intended them to or not."
12705,"You could technically potentially save someone's life, statistically speaking, by never driving a car again."
12706,"I think if you're vaccinated, you've taken a reasonable step towards mitigating the risk of harm to others, and I don't think society expects you to go out of your way to further reduce that risk."
12707,I think that altering your lifestyle in that way is probably unnecessary.
12708,"They stopped lying about the number of deaths - didn't really have much choice, it looked rather absurd when excess deaths were showing 5x the official toll."
12709,I hope there is an end of the line for the long covid sufferers.
12710,"For the world's sake as well, I really hope the scientists of the modern world could find some stuffs to alleviate or even erase long covid other than just managing it's symptoms."
12711,Thank you for the answer!
12712,I really appreciate it.
12713,"30, overweight not obese, female, asthma and sepsis last year."
12714,We wouldn‚Äôt reach herd immunity for the flu without vaccines - same with a lot of stuff
12715,Possibly the worst ever usage of the word ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù in the history of the English language.
12716,&gt; I feel like this is the kind of thing you do when you've tested positive but don't want to cancel your travel (because you're inconsiderate of others)
12717,My wife has been working in an office with covid deniers this entire time.
12718,You need to protect yourself.
12719,"She wears an n95 quality mask, sits next to her true HEPA air purifier (Filtrete purchased off the shelf at Lowe‚Äôs, not a fake knock off on Amazon), and stays several feet away from others when possible."
12720,She also uses really excellent hand sanitizer (people wipe their nose and open the door all the time‚Äîwatch them).
12721,Purell Prime Defense is 85% alcohol.
12722,"It costs more, but we see no need to skimp on protecting her from grubby nasty fingers on the copier and such at work."
12723,"And yes, she is fully vaccinated."
12724,"She just does not want to get ANY kind of covid, not mild or whatever low bar whatever organization is trying to set."
12725,This is an excellent point.
12726,"I read the article and thought, ""classic."""
12727,"Became really sick a few days after staying on the Las Vegas strip, no one wore masks."
12728,It‚Äôs already happening.
12729,"Public school funds are being obliterated, the poor are being left behind."
12730,The inequality is just going to get deeper.
12731,Home schooling and private schooling are roaring; almost all of the private schools are backlogged and have massive wait lists.
12732,"I know, my grandchildren were taken out of California‚Äôs failing public school system."
12733,"The private school system is far superior; the private school kids have been in throughout COVID, with no masks, and are roundly succeeding."
12734,They are going to pass by the poor kids held back by the politicized teachers unions in the public schools.

12737,My feelings are hurt?
12738,Lol.
12739,I‚Äôm double vaccinated.
12740,"What I‚Äôm trying to say is everyone that keeps saying why aren‚Äôt more people getting the shot, and project these kinds of attitudes."
12741,"Guess what, these attitudes won‚Äôt get people to take the shot."
12742,So go right ahead and keep on asking why people don‚Äôt get the shot.
12743,I don‚Äôt care either way.
12744,The CDC isn't tracking breakthrough infections unless they result in hospitalization and lied about masks and airborne transmission.
12745,"There's no ""data"" for them to follow except that that comes out of another country."
12746,"I'd pay attention to what health authorities in countries that have more successfully responded to the pandemic if you want to ""trust science and data."""
12747,"Countries like Israel, who are tracking all breakthrough infections, are saying we need indoor masking until vaccination rates are far higher than they are now in the US."
12748,"I live in vegas, no one wears masks anymore and I honestly thought the vaccine meant I would be ok :/"
12749,do you have gas appliances at your house?
12750,Pfizer believes we **will** need a booster.
12751,The issue is that they didn't get with the CDC/FDA on the same page before they announced that they are applying for authorization for it.
12752,"The administration has to manage a bunch of people of all walks of life, which means they have to play stupid mother fornicating games because people react differently to things like ""needing a booster""."
12753,To some that may discourage them from getting the vaccine to begin with.
12754,Because clearly it works feck all if you need to boost it constantly.
12755,Scott G. believes that boosting will be available at some point in the fall/winter at the very least some vulnerable segment of the population.
12756,They (Pfizer) are also analyzing data out of Israel and will be presenting to the FDA/CDC regarding the need to boost after X number of months.
12757,It's a process.
12758,AZ flubbed its trials in the US.
12759,"That gave J&amp;J an opportunity for its vaccine, which is similar enough to AZ that there‚Äôs no real push for AZ in the US anymore."
12760,87% is astonishing.
12761,I'm impressed.

12773,"Several times I couldn‚Äôt breathe I thought, this is it."
12774,Luckily they avoided intubating me and had me on an oxygen mask the entire first day.
12775,This is why your reasoning is grade school surface level.
12776,There's no covid right now.
12777,"Emphasize that because you need to plan for the future, not just for the now."
12778,"I thought the USA was not even recognizing Astra Zeneca, and the EU is supposedly the villain for not recognizing AZ from one plant which did not bother to ask for certification?"

12780,Yeah.
12781,I often  there is political and economical motivation to a lot of these new pieces.

12810,COVID hospitalization rates for &lt;30s are near what they are for influenza writ large and nobody ever seemed to care about the flu for whatever reason.

12830,Vaccinations + masks = another level of protection than either of them can provide on their own.
12831,The goal with vaccination should be to not die or be hospitalized with severe covid.

12845,"In my area, there's a high vaccination rate and case rates are now tiny."

12896,Any corporation with half an accounting department does this.
12897,Everyone KNOWS this.
12898,Maybe write a story about how we fix this problem.
12899,"Notably, the index cases were recently immunized with Covaxin (an inactivated-virus vaccine made in India), receiving the second dose 10 days before travelling to Houston to attend the wedding."
12900,"In US CDC terminology, they were not 'fully vaccinated' (which starts 2 weeks after final dose); there wasn't any mention in the paper about the timing of their first doses or the timing of the vaccination of the other four cases."
12901,The index cases were asymptomatic at the wedding and developed symptoms and tested positive a few days later.
12902,Other vaccines are mandatory and have been for years.
12903,People don't want science; people want politics.
12904,Same in MA.
12905,We had the outdoor mandate but it was not enforced.
12906,"If you push ""Vaccinated people still need to wear masks"" at the same time you also push ""Don't get vaccinated."
12907,"You will still have to wear a mask, so it is pointless."""
12908,You end up discouraging people who are getting the vaccine in order to stop wearing masks from doing so.
12909,"So ask yourself, would you rather people were vaccinated or wearing masks?"
12910,You can't have both.
12911,"I think that effectively means ""indefinitely""."
12912,"I don't really see things getting any better than they are now in the near term, in the US."
12913,Might be another year or two.
12914,Possibly a lot longer.
12915,Other vaccine's are mandatory.
12916,"For example: WA state currently requires that public school students submit proof of immunity or immunization records for chickenpox, polio, hepatitis B, the combined tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis vaccine (Tdap), and the combined measles, mumps and rubella shot (MMR)"
12917,"Yes, I don‚Äôt get the sense that it cares about long covid either."
12918,It is as it has always been from the beginning: use your own head when it comes to protecting yourself and your family.
12919,The fed has objectives that don‚Äôt necessarily square with how covid will impact your particular life (like lying about masks to preserve supply for medical workers.
12920,The people who could see what was happening in early NY started wearing masks no matter what the fed and social media said‚Äîthey were right).
12921,the sample size in that is so tiny that it's not very helpful.
12922,Look at 1 dose Pfizer for hospitalization (Table 1):  The 95% confidence level range is 46% - 99%.

12931,"There isn't a single identifier (like a SSN) that is used to track all your medical data, it's just a collection of data points like: first name, last name, address, phone number, etc."
12932,"Some of your vaccinations are in your states database (I don't know if all states have mandatory databases now, but if they do, they are fairly recent)."
12933,Some of your info is only on some doctor's computer or in some file room.
12934,It's easier in countries where there is a single database that logs everything.
12935,Someone correct me if I'm wrong.
12936,"Good; better to do it carefully, slowly and intelligently than otherwise."
12937,I don't think they care either way.

12958,"Must suck up to Big Brother Putin, after all, citizens' lives and health are secondary."
12959,I'll speculate here.
12960,I think they don't pay for education for everyone because they want a working class.
12961,And higher education is reserved for the privileged.
12962,"&gt;They don't practice literal slave labor over there, even if working conditions are not always ideal or as safe as in the US."
12963,That's funny because it's been called that.
12964,It's coerced labor sometimes.
12965,They kind of earn enough to pay for it.
12966,Basically Asian parents will pay for their kids education and tutoring if they can afford it because they view their children's as retirement investments.
12967,Because the children take care of the parents in their culture.
12968,But there's plenty who can't afford it.
12969,"&gt;Whereas in the west increasingly, it doesn't matter how good your degree is unless you go to an Ivy League college, and even then there are no guarantees."
12970,I would strongly disagree with this.
12971,Hell I know a rich Asian who is going to a non ivy league west coast school and he's going to be rich like his father.
12972,He's going to school here because the schools are better quality and easier to get into than the ones in his country.

12979,Kids under 12 cannot get the vax.
12980,Stop your weak gaslighting and admit your stance has a few flaws.

12986,"And as an even wiser man once said, a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds."

12988,It's time for you to evaluate the new evidence and update your predictions
12989,&gt;It‚Äôs just a preview as to what is coming for the rest of the country when schools and other places reopen without mitigation strategies.
12990,"This is going to sound horrible, but once we hit the vaccination 'ceiling'... higher transmission (whether because of a characteristic of the variants or just human behavior) will probably get us to herd immunity faster."
12991,It's going to cost a lot more lives than it should (mostly people who willfully refuse the vaccine).
12992,I just wish the rest of us didn't have to foot the bill for all the coming (almost entirely avoidable) healthcare costs.
12993,"So wear it to protect others, then."
12994,"I‚Äôm vaccinated and if I get COVID, I likely won‚Äôt know it because I‚Äôm young and will probably be asymptomatic."
12995,That means I could be going around unknowingly spreading COVID to unvaccinated  kids and immunocompromised people who can‚Äôt make antibodies.
12996,Wearing a mask in public indoor spaces is the least I can do to protect them.

13010,"Without tracking down the review preprint...hate news articles that don't link it (note reviews are not original research, but summaries reviewing and often including opinion about original research), I'm confused by this statement: ‚ÄúThe failure to detect a potential natural host has stimulated suggestions by some that the Covid-19 pandemic has resulted from the escape of an engineered virus from a lab in Wuhan, China."""
13011,"Aren't all mustelids (weasels, minks, etc) readily infected?"
13012,Felines as well but they don't seem to transmit easily so maybe low viral load (poor receptor recognition).
13013,But mink farms had major outbreaks and clear animal to animal spread.
13014,Seems like it could have plenty of natural originating animal hosts.
13015,"I'm a PhD scientist in the biological sciences and previously did research in laboratory evolution and work generally with microbial genetics (mostly applied research genetically engineering them, been doing this for 14 years) and I BLASTed every coding sequence in the viral genome early on after some weird preprint came out claiming there were small bits of HIV amino acid sequences in it (this was extremely spurious and the article failed peer review for many reasons) and there was nothing there."
13016,"It most closely matched, in every gene, a particular natural bat coronavirus, but was also clearly evolutionarily distant from anything deposited and the genes were so scrambled that it was impossible it was engineered at least from any public database."
13017,Simply would be too sophisticated for any human to have done it.
13018,It looked completely natural to me.
13019,"When people genetically engineer things, we lop out chunks of one sequence and substitute in others that are well characterized pieces from something else."
13020,"There is none of that with SARS-CoV-2, period."
13021,Humans can't edit thousands upon thousands of individual bases and do anything intelligent like that.
13022,It is definitely 100% natural.

13043,Found Alabama lol
13044,I agree i'm just saying that a compulsory vaccination policy isn't going to work most other countries.
13045,If you're going to get sick and end up with health problems you're going to end up a lot more excluded from society.
13046,Controlling viral spread is in everyone's interest.
13047,But now they can enter anything.
13048,Its better to require testing before entering a bar or something so you at least see some people which are positive.
13049,"""This content is only available to subscribers."""
13050,Governments around the world should have clamped down harder on non vaccinated people.
13051,Instead everyone rushed to open up &amp; now we‚Äôre going to see Delta surges in every corner of the world where people aren‚Äôt vaccinated.
13052,It‚Äôs a mess
13053,Not proportionately.
13054,"More people under 40, including children, died in car crashes than from COVID."
13055,"The large majority of COVID deaths in pretty much every country were people over 65 and, even then, more over 70 died than the younger segments of that demographic."
13056,"The average life expectancy in general is like, what, 70 or something anyway?"

13059,"But, honestly, we really through risk assessment out the window for young and middle aged people."
13060,The covishield one is made by the largest vaccine producer in the world.
13061,If anything it‚Äôs probably a superior product to the EU / UK made version because these guys‚Äô business is vaccine production.
13062,Individual EU countries ( last I looked there were ten including Germany) were already accepting Covishield vaccines.

13071,Almost everyone else is undervaccinated or unvaccinated.
13072,No doubt they will be fully approved.

13079,"If we all leave, these states are definitely lost and a dangerous problem."
13080,I just do not see how it's possible for high vax states to hit fall numbers.
13081,I expect this to be more like last summer.
13082,There is just not enough people to infect.
13083,My county is at 80% of 12 and up fully vaxed.
13084,Must be so frustrating.
13085,I hope they get vaxxed soon.
13086,I‚Äôm fully vaxxed and I got mine because even tho I wasn‚Äôt eligible (only open to over 65 with NCDs at the time) I went 4 days in a row to different health centers to wait in case anyone didn‚Äôt show up for their appointment and there was a dose that would be wasted.
13087,Day 4 I got lucky.

13090,"And I have young kids, AND I am still being careful."
13091,But what I have been pushing back against is people who don't have kids being afraid to trust the vaccine **to the degree advised by the CDC**.
13092,The CDC says you don't need to wear a mask?
13093,Then don't run around spreading fear that taking off the masks will lead to catastrophe.
13094,I am gonna protect my kids regardless of what other people do.
13095,And I don't appreciate my family being used as justification for undermining what the science tells us about vaccine efficacy.

13111,"I on the otherhand had a terrible reaction for my second shot, and was unprepared for it."
13112,It's worth noting that I had an electrolyte imbalance from eating low carb that made me like 10x more dehydrated.
13113,"When my fever broke and I came to at 3am, my heart was going bonkers and I was too weak to walk more than a few steps without collapsing/fainting and get myself some water."

13116,I think that downplaying it(I think adverse reactions only happen for 1 in 4 people) would help further instill distrust.
13117,It would also have made me go to the ER because it seriously felt like I was dying at one point when I tried to get up and make my way downstairs for some water.

13142,Of course it's going to get approved.
13143,Over half the country took one of these three vaccines.
13144,"For the FDA to then turn around and say ""on second thought, maybe these aren't so safe after all"" would destroy any credibility the FDA has left, and it would also drive the anti-vax movement to new heights."
13145,Yeah I concur on both points.
13146,But neither is super alarming to me.
13147,Unless they think they are infected and would not pass a real test.
13148,In which the fist of law should smash.
13149,"Pfizer, Moderna and J&amp;J Covid- 19 vaccines have already been used by millions and millions of people worldwide."
13150,"&gt;""Within the Biden administration, some fear that if Americans are convinced that coronavirus vaccines provide only short-lived immunity before requiring a booster, they will be less likely to accept a shot."
13151,This is why the CDC is continuing to destroy its credibility - they are basing all of their messaging on the idea that once you get vaccinated you can personally forget about COVID because they think that will convince more people to get vaccinated even though the actual rates of vaccination make it clear that's not the case.
13152,"Now don't get me wrong, I don't think Pfizer has the purest of intentions or anything, but I straight up don't trust the CDC and would like to see them release the actual data Pfizer is giving them for boosters."
13153,"Yeah, I doubt I \*NEED\* a shot, but maybe I will look at that data and decide I want one."
13154,"Yeah, I had to explain this to a co-worker that was worried about it and I just showed how they've been grown from fetal cells from the 70s and 80s."
13155,"I am a Christian and so is my friend, so I even went the route of, ""Yes, I wish the abortions hadn't happened at all, but think about the uncountable number of lives saved by the measles, TDAP, Diptheria, etc vaccines?"

13164,It is 100% true that fewer people will die because a portion of the country is vaccinated than if nobody was vaccinated.
13165,That is true and undeniable.
13166,The vaccines are wonderful.
13167,But increased cases means increased deaths.
13168,The majority of the protection from death by the vaccines is the protection from cases.
13169,"A surge in cases is happening despite vaccination, and because so many people are unvaccinated."
13170,In parts of the country only a little over a third of people are fully vaccinated.
13171,"In order to say that as cases go up, which will mostly be in unvaccinated people, but deaths won't, you have to explain why the Delta variant won't kill unvaccinated people."

13181,"That's actually just the number for hospitalized or fatal breakthrough cases reported, not the total number of breakthrough cases (which would be much higher)."
13182,See more [here](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/health-departments/breakthrough-cases.html).
13183,"Importantly, there is this tidbit on the CDC's page I linked above:

&gt; As of May 1, 2021, CDC transitioned from monitoring all reported vaccine breakthrough cases to focus on identifying and investigating only hospitalized or fatal cases due to any cause."

13198,In the US corporations have been heavily funding science denial for the last 40 years.
13199,Because science leads to regulation.
13200,And regulation leads to lower profits.
13201,"*‚ÄùIt feels like a rerun of a really bad show that I didn‚Äôt like the first time and I like it even less the second,‚Äù Ranney said of seeing cases rise in areas with low vaccination rates."

13215,Oh I absolutely respect your desire to protect your Infant any way possible and appreciate your kind response to me.. and if I had a newborn I wouldn't let any anti vaxxer near them in fact I don't even really associate with anti vaxxers because I find them just selfish misinformed people in general.

13217,"It's a scary time without a pandemic you worry about their food, chemicals, literally anything lol, and with the pandemic it just adds to that."
13218,And there are things that I'll change about my habits even after this pandemic is in the rear view mirror..  for example I still think masks should be normalized for people who choose to and we shouldn't ever judge them.
13219,I'll wear one if I feel sick and having sanitizing stations and things should be normal now because heck flu deaths have been down as well.. and I understand babies have basic needs where mental health isn't so much an issue.
13220,So I understand where you're coming from I guess the issue I have is people judging others for wanting (or needing for their sanity tbh) to unmask and see smiles and be able to hug and be close to other humans again.
13221,And so for that reason I think even though  mandates were necessary and in many cases still are.. but looking at the data and risks at some point moving forward it needs to be personal choice
13222,Are these mandatory in the EU?

""If you‚Äôve recovered from a confirmed case of COVID-19 within the past 3 months: You don‚Äôt need to stay home after a new negative test, unless you start getting symptoms, which is still possible because your protection from a past infection is weaker than a vaccine‚Äôs protection."

13233,I have no idea by how much.

13236,It's nearly impossible for it not to be approved.
13237,The physical components basically dissolve.
13238,Even the antibodies wear off over time.
13239,The only permanent thing left at that point is the t-cell memory and there would have to be some really strange outlier for that to have any lasting effects other than protecting you from infection.

13345,Extinction Level Stupidity.
13346,On my local Facebook group I shared this article and someone said a doctor didn't say if the children were vaccinated.
13347,Most likely they weren't.
13348,But here's the thing.
13349,"If anyone vaccinated winds up hospitalized, they almost certainly would had died if not for the vaccine."
13350,"Because their immune system is just not great, and the antibodies didn't work to keep covid at bay."
13351,It certainly was not because of the vaccine that people who contract covid get hospitalized.
13352,Anyone hospitalized after vaccination would had been hospitalized without vaccination.
13353,But the idea with the vaccines now is to prevent serious disease.
13354,"When that happens, covid will be more like the flu."
13355,The flu is an ‚Äúendemic‚Äù disease since it comes back every year.
13356,"Likely the same will happen with covid, after much of the population gets vaccinated."

13362,Deaths will lag new cases by 4-6 weeks.

13374,Is there any way to avoid false-positives after recovering from Covid?
13375,I tested positive with the delta variant on July 7th and am now symptom free as of today.
13376,"I unfortunately have to get a surgery within the next few weeks, and I need to test negative for covid within 5 days of the surgery."
13377,I know the antibodies can stay within your body for a longer period of time after recovery and cause a false positive test.

13379,I'm struggling to come up with the right words to describe how awful that is.

13386,"I don't know what unusual weird unknown side effects that weren't found in 16,17 months are going to be found in 24,36, and so on."
13387,But I would bet good money a huge chunk of people that still haven't gotten vaccinated aren't going to change their mind once full approval is given the green light.
13388,If those who already had it are excluded- good idea.
13389,Otherwise they will face a lot of resistance and ager from an already angry staff
13390,"You are right and I would be happy if the public health administration would think like that, but Belgium is notorious for the three major regions not working together."
13391,Israel has published their experience with Pfizer‚Äôs efficacy on Delta.
13392,It is only 64% at preventing symptoms but still 98% successful in preventing a hospital admission.

13396,Here's some light reading about the effects of asymptomatic and mild/moderate cases.
13397,It seems that there's a lot we're still discovering about the effects of Covid-19 and their duration.
13398,Asymptomatic doesn't equal an absence of ill effects.
13399,"‚ÄúThe researchers found elevations of C5b9 in pediatric  patients with severe COVID-19 and MIS-C, but to their surprise, they also found that C5b9 was elevated in patients with minimal or asymptomatic disease."
13400,"Of the 22 patients for whom complete data were available, 19 (86%) met the criteria for TMA [thrombotic microangiopathy]."
13401,"Additionally, sC5b9 levels were elevated both in patients who did and did not meet criteria for TMA."
13402,"Although most children with COVID-19 do not have severe disease, our study shows that there may be other effects of SARS-CoV-2 that are worthy of investigation.‚Äù

13415,and cases are surging here.
13416,We went from 10 cases per day to around 40 and the curve is still going up quite steeply.
13417,It seems more and more like the delta variant can also transmit between vaccinated people.
13418,Note that the vaccines are still effective at preventig severe disease and hospitalization.

13431,The people who have been vaccinated are the ones who are trusting to science.
13432,"So, you may ask, ""Why don't you trust the CDC now??"""
13433,"With the Delta variant in particular, we can't know the extent to which vaccinated people are spreading the virus if the CDC simply isn't tracking that data outside of deaths and hospitalizations."
13434,"Out of sight, out of mind."
13435,"They jumped the gun on removing the mask mandate when the vaccines were proven to be strong against the UK variant, but the Delta variant is a whole other animal."
13436,"Now the CDC is digging their heels in on their decision to remove the mask mandate, even if that decision is already proving costly."

13458,"Nor do they even really have to have every lab, test kits could come with a key for the test that could be unique, it's super easy to do and the tests are much more centralized than the labs

Another really simple way to do it is to just know the correct ID pattern like the pattern of a Visa card number, again it could be done centrally by the people issuing the test kit."

13503,"How to manage that is tricky, especially since some of the current messaging around variants may convince people that it's pointless to get a vaccine now (""I'll wait for the update"")."
13504,It just isn't a good idea for governments to be making decisions on the basis that they won't have another wave.
13505,They almost certainly will.
13506,"Pretty much the only place in the world that has managed to avoid another wave is New Zealand, unless you believe China's case numbers."
13507,"It's more like people working with at-risk people having to get vaccinated or they'd stop getting paid and the vaccine being needed to get access to a lot of places and not just caf√©s, but that headline wasn't as catchy I guess."

13510,"Too bad that‚Äôs irrelevant to the core issue people have with it, huh?"
13511,You should take it easy.
13512,Less then 0.7% of all deaths (all causes) in the 0-17 year old group involve Covid-19.
13513,"Considering that risk increases with age, for 18 months baby Covid represents such a tiny risk that it is not worth worrying about too much."
13514,I think both of those factors are wildly unknowable.
13515,I‚Äôm not claiming that his conclusion is necessarily incorrect.
13516,I‚Äôm just saying we can‚Äôt know and shouldn‚Äôt act like we can.

13527,Whereas here we don't even have an official ID card.

13537,"Here's a small nugget of information that is relevent:

&gt; Evidence from the first study of long covid in children suggests that **more than half of children aged between 6 and 16 years old who contract the virus have at least one symptom lasting more than 120 days**, with 42.6 per cent impaired by these symptoms during daily activities."
13538,I would provide more links but the last time I posted a comment with more links it was automatically removed.
13539,"Obviously the cases where kids get double lung transplants or have all of their limbs amputated are rare, but stuff like having a severely reduced ability to breathe are not that unusual."
13540,This is the most relevant comment in this entire thread.
13541,"Yes, and I haven't heard anybody from the government trying to hide them, on the contrary the healthcare authorities openly said that they attributed something like 80 or 90 percent of the excess deaths to COVID"
13542,The federal government did a great job buying vaccines.
13543,The provincial government did a terrible job distributing them.
13544,"Again, if you think people lining up at 3am in 2021 to get a vaccine is a great system.."

13548,Canada ordered a lot of vaccines.

13576,Take a look at where cases are surging.
13577,To look at the overall country‚Äôs numbers presents a far different picture than to look at the local counties where the surge is taking place.
13578,The surge counties match up almost perfectly with the counties who have the lowest vaccination rate.
13579,"Vaccines work, as of now the confidence in them is not misplaced."
13580,"I say this as someone who has fully followed COVID protocols and got vaxxed as soon as I can, but you need to recognize the media has an interest in keeping COVID relevant."

13649,Just because they‚Äôre now getting it doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre suddenly not an asshole.

13652,South Korea's effective response is by far much more to do with effective border controls and contact tracing than mask-wearing.
13653,"Even if we wanted to, as you said, there simply aren't enough KN95 masks to go around and very few Governments seem to think providing them at no expense to their citizens is a cost-effective way to fight the pandemic."

- have been fully vaccinated under the UK vaccination programme"""
13671,"Even if it did get full FDA approval, which could take months.. they still will resist it."
13672,When you call stupid people on their bullshit they simply get stupider and hide under more bullshit.
13673,That part is correct but his reasoning is inconclusive.
13674,"My point is that vaccinating an unvaccinated individual will, on average, prevent more COVID cases than a booster shot will."
13675,"So even if a vaccinated person without a booster is more likely to develop a resistant strain if you choose to give them a booster instead of vaccinating someone else you will end up with more other people infected, again on average."
13676,This means that which scenario is more likely to create new and resistant strains depends on how much more likely a vaccinated individual is to create new variants than an unvaccinated one and how many more people would be infected if you gave a booster instead of vaccinating a new individual.
13677,"It's the case in the US and it's been the case here in Italy as well, I'd be very surprised if it's any different in France."
13678,"I guess you could make an argument that the people signing up are not the same who were pushing that propaganda, to which I don't have an answer."

13684,"You‚Äôre right, it didn‚Äôt have to be this way."
13685,Many of these antivaxxers are also covid deniers.

13691,So glad that we don't have to deal with the full effects of the virus!
13692,The problem is that there is also an opposite camp of quacks.
13693,"Some people who are suffering from an undiagnosed chronic illness (usually at least displaying pain and/or fatigue) can fall victim to shady doctors who claim it is ""hidden"" Lyme, even though repeated blood tests show no trace."
13694,"Then they fleece these patients (tens of thousands of Euros) and pump them full of antibiotics for many months, even though these medications are only meant to be used in the short term; thus causing additional damage to the patient's health."
13695,"A smart man once said, ""There is immunity in community, but there is desolation in isolation."""
13696,Florida doesn't even want to inspect buildings.
13697,He didn‚Äôt agree with me.

13719,We are almost leading the world for second doses.
13720,I‚Äôm not sure what you are arguing.
13721,Nobody is suggesting storing these vaccines.
13722,People only need 28 days between doses.
13723,The government didn‚Äôt order a random number of doses coming at a random time.
13724,Of course they know how much is supposed to be delivered and when.
13725,If you order 100 Pfizer and 100 Moderna and you give 80 people Pfizer as a first dose because that‚Äôs what you got first - you won‚Äôt have enough Pfizer for second doses.
13726,It‚Äôs not hard to understand.
13727,Yeah it's such a wierd track for them to take.
13728,"The vaccine can be very safe, very effective, but also not be a magic ""you get to forget about COVID now"" bullet."
13729,"Maybe you need to still wear a mask in public, maybe you need a booster, maybe you still have to sometimes do some other actions."

Vaccines are less effective with Delta when it comes to mild or asymptomatic cases -

Canada studies show 88% protection against symptomatic infection -¬†https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.28.21259420v1

Scotland has shown 79% against infection -¬†https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)01358-1/fulltext

Israel shows 64-70% against infection -¬†https://www.wsj.com/articles/pfizers-covid-19-vaccine-is-less-effective-against-delta-variant-israeli-data-show-11625572796

Singapore shows 69% against infection."
13969,"So we land somewhere between 64% and 88%, likely somewhere in the middle."
13970,Some of the best studies come from Singaporean contact tracers.
13971,"Singapore has high vaccination rates with mRNA and they‚Äôre still seeing tons of asymptomatic spread even via fully-vaccinated individuals:¬†¬†¬†https://twitter.com/michaelzlin/status/1409707511519748102?s=21

We aren't tracing/tracking those infections in the US so we truly don't know how much of our spread is via vaccinated individuals."

13974, I (25 F) am vaccinated and currently have a mild case of the delta variant.
13975,"Thank god (science) I‚Äôm vaccinated because these ‚Äòmild‚Äô symptoms = the sickest I‚Äôve been in years, I can only imagine how back it could have been otherwise."
13976,Because it makes no sense otherwise.
13977,"New York has a ~70% vaccination rate and despite not having restrictions anymore basically has had minimal COVID case growth (still below 3 per 100,000 on a daily basis)."
13978,This would only be possible if vaccines also had very low breakthrough rates.
13979,"There hasn't been enough data published for him to say they're needed, but of course that could change."
13980,"There has been some data, but it's not in depth enough."
13981,"I think Pfizer might be sensing that boosters may be needed here at some point based on internal data, so are preemptively getting a plan in place for that scenario, whether it be in the fall or a year from now."
13982,"Keep in mind, a few more bad mutations could really reduce efficacy, so you want to be prepared in case something worse than delta pops up."
13983,Yeah but demographics matter and we have zero visibility into that from the raw case numbers.
13984,A person over 85 is 600x more likely to die from covid than someone 18-29.
13985,The curve rises exponentially with age.
13986,"And in CA, 94% of the people over 65 have one dose of the vaccine."
13987,Most of the unvaccinated are younger and therefore much less likely to die or get very sick from covid.
13988,What is wearing a mask?
13989,BS.
13990,Is it psychologically damaging to wear shoes?
13991,Clothes?

13994,GG life
13995,Ouch.
13996,That stinks.
13997,And also reinforces me still wearing a mask.
13998,I don‚Äôt need to be pretty THAT badly.
13999,"&gt; But the efficacy wouldn't be 95%, the 5% number wouldn't hold."
14000,"Efficacy is stated in terms of disease-environment of the trial, which is one reason why the Pfizer/Moderna numbers aren't comparable to AZ/Chinese ones despite real world evidence showing that these vaccines work just about the same

I'm illustrating the concept of efficacy."
14001,Not stating that French-kissing Covid carriers will preserve the efficacy.
14002,Remember the vaccine is only 90-60% effective in preventing infection (although vaccinated people who are infected will have reduced symptoms).
14003,So the strategy to prevent the virus breaking through is to vaccinate as many people as possible.
14004,If all the people around you are vaccinated then you're less likely to have your vaccination be put to the test and buckle under pressure.
14005,"I don't know what percentage of the population we need vaccinated to reach ""herd immunjty"" (the point where outbreaks stop due to the percentage of vaccinated being high enough) but I don't think any country has reached it yet."
14006,It might be something as high as 80-90%.
14007,(My country is only 3% vaccinated lol.)
14008,"We think what's happening in Israel is that a lot of old folk with poor immune systems were the first to be vaccinated, and they're more likely to fall into the 10-40% who still get infected (reduced symptoms but still slight risk of death)."
14009,So they're depending on the people around them to get vaccinated in order to reduce that risk.
14010,Just science being complicated.
14011,The fact that we might need a booster shot for Delta (or whichever variant comes next) is an added level of complication too
14012,I'd be more worried about other sicknesses

14019,"They‚Äôre clearly hearing at home how awful and terrible masks are, and they internalize that."
14020,Kids who hear from their parents why masks are important and how they allow us to safely attend school are fine with them.

14053,95% effectiveness means 95% less likely to have symptomatic infection than if the person was not vaccinated; not that the vaccine works 95% of times.
14054,Do you know how you caught it?
14055,"&gt;But if a very large number of vaccinated individuals were to do the above, the number of symptomatic carriers would be 5% of the number compared to an identical cohort of unvaccinated individuals."
14056,That does not sound right to me.
14057,"I do not think they studied such massive exposure, and unless I am mistaken, we have no reason to believe the effects will scale like that."
14058,"I imagine there are thresholds at which the 95/5 observation no longer holds true, and at a certain point, I would think *everyone* would get sick."

14060,Get rid of that normal behavior--even if everyone deviates in the same way--and the statistics may no longer apply.
14061,"The ratios aren't predictable or obvious, but the correlation between cases, hospitalizations and deaths are."

14063,"in the UK, the same lag between cases, hospitalizations and deaths existed in this wave, but the hospitalization spike and death spike were muted."
14064,"I think the US will experience significantly more death, and hospitalization because it has nowhere near the same uptake amongst the elderly."

14067,Bruhhh this is fucked
14068,Genuine question: what is your endgame here then?
14069,"Yes, it's lower protection (though I am seeing further studies showing far greater than 60% protection), but it's the best we got right now, and I know that even if I'm exposed my symptoms and transmissibility will almost certainly be minimized due to my vaccine."
14070,I see no end in sight for people still insistent on masks/distancing right now if they're fully vaccinated.
14071,"There's literally nothing else we can do, so I am going to take the risk, and it will take a much much greater risk than even the peak of the earlier waves for me to go back to the hell of limited gatherings, not going places, etc."

14085,"I understand that every government will put its own citizens first, but every other vaccine-producing nation besides the US was willing to export at least *some* of its production."
14086,imagine if the EU had also refused to export any vaccines!
14087,It's good that the government had smart procurement policies that paid off in the end.
14088,"But I'm really impressed by just how much our citizens have embraced the cause, like a nation-in-arms against Covid."
14089,[removed]
14090,"So what you‚Äôre saying is that we should not only mandate masks, but also ensure that everyone has access to a supply of high quality masks."
14091,"Great idea, I fully support it!"
14092,"I‚Äôm at the two week point of J&amp;J (not completely out of the woods but still looking good), and I have gotten no side effects whatsoever (apart from a couple very minor ones on the first day)"
14093,I meant when they leave the home obviously.
14094,I like how infected mask-wearing fully vaccinated hospital workers are much less likely to transmit the virus to others while working in indoor spaces.
14095,The target is ‚Äúmasks are comfortable for me so everyone should wear one until I *feel* safe‚Äù
14096,Is it not so bad then as WHO still aren't sure how well asymptomatic people can transmit the virus.
14097,"""World Health Organization official clarified on Tuesday that scientists have not determined yet how frequently people with asymptomatic cases of Covid-19 pass the disease on to others, a day after suggesting that such spread is ‚Äúvery rare.‚Äù"
14098,Stuff like this is giving people a false sense of security.
14099,"It‚Äôs really to early to tell, the sample size isn‚Äôt large enough yet."
14100,Don‚Äôt rush the science.
14101,Rich countries ARE donating.
14102,Faster than the shots can actually be given in many cases.
14103,In the last two days alone the US has donated 36 million vaccines separate from covax.
14104,The US has pledged 500 million vaccines in the next year and 200 million before the end of this year.
14105,Covax is at fault here (aka the WHO) for a slow ponderous rollout with no real plan in terms of actually getting shots into arms.
14106,It does no good for countries to donate vaccines and money to COVAX only to have them sit in warehouses.
14107,Who wears masks at home?
14108,And no one's face was ever seen again.
14109,What's the end game?
14110,When everyone's vaccinated?
14111,Way to go Gavin
14112,[removed]
14113,"&gt; There's still an obvious predictable correlation between cases, hospitalizations and deaths, it's just not the same ratios."
14114,"Yeah well, the ratios aren't ""predictable"" or ""obvious"" if you ask me."
14115,But maybe you'd care to cite some research to back up your assertions?
14116,"When Georgia refused to give me a vaccine but forced me to teach 100 students in person, it was Alabama that gave me a vaccine."
14117,So I will always be grateful for Alabama!

14126,It's both.
14127,"Some breakthrough infections are because that person didn't mount a good immune response to the vaccine (or it has waned), some are because they were exposed to a super-high dose of the virus (or repeated exposure) or an extra infectious variant."
14128,And some are a combination thereof.
14129,You can't tell which unless the person had an antibody test just before being exposed.
14130,Yeah the feds really got the stock and I can even commend the province on rollout despite how terribly they handled the lockdown
14131,Tetanus shots every 10 years is only something that's really practiced in North America and some European countries.
14132,The NHS in the UK only reccomends the typical childhood course of tetanus shots.
14133,I think the latter.
14134,Or just keep a database so that anti vaxxers can opt out and we can actually have a more precise count of how many to keep.
14135,But that would actually require a competent government with up to date systems..
14136,I honestly cannot believe that idiots think our government could orchestrate an entire conspiracy..
14137,"And remember, the immunocompromised and elderly were among the first to get a vaccine, so they will be the first to wane if this is true."
14138,It‚Äôs specific to schools because teachers have no choice about being there.
14139,There‚Äôs a teacher at my school who is 64 and a two time cancer survivor.
14140,He‚Äôs not quite at retirement age.
14141,He‚Äôs very high risk and immune compromised.
14142,If he gets it despite being vaccinated it could kill him.
14143,"But you think it‚Äôs fine for him to be forced to be exposed to dozens of unmasked, unvaccinated kids each week?"
14144,That said I do also think we should still have mandates at other places like the grocery that elderly and high risk folks may have no choice but to be at.

14155,What vaccine is everyone getting in Madrid?
14156,That will depend on whether the cases surge out of control in heavily vaccinated areas.

14171,They were giving out the doses they had.
14172,They didn't have moderna shots.
14173,It was either hang on to a bunch of Pfizer while people are unvaccinated or give people the doses they had.
14174,falls
14175,Actually it does protect them.
14176,Getting vaccinated doesn‚Äôt mean you cant get infected.
14177,It just means you will not likely develop **as** severe symptoms or die.
14178,"You can still develop symptoms, long covid, require oxygen and other interventions, and/or hospitalization."
14179,Vaccinated individuals can also transmit the virus to other vaccinated individuals and unvaccinated individuals.
14180,"Before you say unvaccinated people made their bed and should lie in it, please consider that unvaccinated individuals contain:
- children under 12 (who may develop long covid systems, develop multi-Inflamatory syndrome or experience other developmental issues since this isn‚Äôt a long studied disease)
- immunocompromised individuals who cannot take vaccines or who don‚Äôt create sufficient antibodies to fight covid."

14212,I get 800k-1.2 million visitors through my workplace yearly.
14213,Nearly half of them are people who cannot get vaccinated.
14214,They‚Äôre under 12.
14215,And also nearly all unmasked.
14216,Between the hordes of young kids and the ~50% of currently unvaxxed adults in my state I will be wearing a mask for probably another half year.
14217,It is authoritarian though lol
14218,Why?
14219,[deleted]
14220,Seems like this will be an excuse for parents to take kids out of public schools.
14221,Epidemologists here are concerned that that mixture gives the virus the perfect environment to mutate to be vaccine resistant.
14222,"When you say you've done quantitative PCR do you mean real time PCR (with florescent dyes), or end point PCR and you quantified the band intensities?"
14223,For real-time PCR like is used for covid tests the total number of cycles is practically meaningless as long as you do enough since the machine measures the amount of DNA after every cycle.
14224,The Ct or cycle threshold is what's important.
14225,For a covid test the Ct of the sample will be compared to the Cts from positive and negative controls to determine if the sample is positive or negative.
14226,Since the controls are run under the same conditions as the test sample things like primer efficiency are taken in to account.
14227,Run along now.
14228,Adults are talking.
14229,lol yes I need to know what gave it away.
14230,"I guess it could have been a random check of the non-existent reference number, but it‚Äôs much more fun to imagine that something else was off with the forgery."
14231,San Francisco is currently at about 30 cases/day with a very low test positivity rate.
14232,"In a city of 800,000, that's really low."
14233,Read my first post.
14234,The risk to kids is extremely small.
14235,Small enough to make masks for them unnecessary.
14236,The vaccine is free and has been from day one
14237,"I find it extremely hard to believe that there are many people on the fence waiting for full FDA approval

The anti-vax crowd has mostly made up their minds based on disinformation and willful ignorance."
14238,And they're either going to say the FDA was coerced into approving it or go make up another excuse.
14239,"Thanks,I hope I can explain better!"
14240,"I was glad when we were progressing vaccination too,but we have supply problem now."
14241,"When I was staying at my GP to be vaccinated,in less than 30 minutes,they got 5 calls asking for vaccine despite they have no spot."
14242,Hoping everybody will able to be vaccinated soon!
14243,"Sorry for""Me brain mess""."

14245,&gt; The EU's coronavirus response has been more coordinated between the countries than the US between its states.
14246,There hasn't been that much coordination between member states.
14247,The most visible thing that has been synced across the EU is the digital covid certificate (EU DCC).
14248,"But while the EU DCC is recognized everywhere, individual countries are still setting their own rules on when the EU DCC is needed and on who can enter under which conditions."
14249,"The EU issues recommendations on what border policies to apply, but most countries put their on twist on them."
14250,Even the country color coding scheme based on infections rates developed by the European CDC isn't adopted universally.
14251,"Vaccine purchases and approval was also done as a joint effort, with each country being allotted a share based on population size."
14252,But rollout details were again left up to the countries themselves.
14253,Things like prioritization and interval between doses are different in different countries.
14254,"Almost all of the covid-19 measures, lockdowns, school closures, mask policies, curfews, were decided at the country level, with the EU having no role in the process."
14255,&gt; The big distinction I'm making is that there is a separate test system for traveling.
14256,In some countries.
14257,"In others, there never was a distinction."
14258,Most people who get covid infections are asymptomtatic...
14259,Different budgets.
14260,Improving student environments is the non existent budget just after the educating student budget.
14261,Hiring admin is increasing the civil servant wage budget and thus enables politicians to say they managed larger scale budgets
14262,"Idk, I'd prefer to force the first dose into certain people who have no good reason not to get vaccinated."
14263,"Using common sense, you would realize that this isn't ever going away."
14264,Coronavirus is here to stay.
14265,"I feel the person above does make a valid point, where do we draw the line?"
14266,&gt;	Apparently it would aid in some mandates of the vaccine by some organizations.
14267,This makes sense to me!
14268,Because older people are largely vaccinated now.
14269,Which have historically made up the bulk of hospitalizations.
14270,Kill our kids!
14271,Kill our kids!
14272,Kill our kids!
14273,"&gt;I just hope the people that do get mild symptoms from breakthroughs don't abandon vaccines in the future because they lose faith from the belief it was a bulletproof vest

I don't understand why so many people have convinced themselves that if they acknowledge that the vaccines are highly effective but not magic bullets that will somehow cause millions of other people to not get vaccinated."
14274,The vaccines are great!
14275,They are amazing!
14276,But that doesn't mean they are perfect and that we should have abandoned all other anti-COVID measures while also allowing half the population to not get vaccinated but still participate in society and put the rest of us at increased risk.
14277,"It's why I think, at least, in most heavily vaccinated areas (i.e."
14278,"California, the majority of the northeast), lawmakers will reinstate vaccine/negative test mandates for large gatherings and indoor dining, while not limiting capacity or canceling things."
14279,Vaccinated folks don't deserve to suffer as a result of Toiletpaper America's stupidity and/or selfishness.
14280,"They made their bed, now live in it and if they don't like it, too fucking bad go live elsewhere if you care that much, but don't ruin it for the rest of us."
14281,They deserve absolutely no sympathy at this point nearly a year and a half in.
14282,"There are other respiratory viruses that are more dangerous to kids than Covid, such as RSV that is currently spreading out of season in the south."
14283,"If we didn‚Äôt mask kids before, what justifies doing it now and indefinitely into the future?"
14284,wouldnt the parents be fine if they are vaxxed?
14285,or are we ignoring the science now?

14306,"Per the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/vaers/index.html), the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is used to collect reports of adverse events after vaccination from the general public."
14307,This is primarily used to identify potential topics to further investigate with regards to vaccine reactions.
14308,"However, because the event data in VAERS is often not verified and is often self-reported, it should not be assumed that the adverse events in VAERS are actually associated with or cause by the vaccines, nor is it possible to estimate the frequency of these adverse events from these data."

14315,"But for example, how many people have died due to the vaccine?"
14316,Is that available anywhere?
14317,VAERS is lacking and vague.

14319,"The UK on their Covid response site says, once you dig through it, that they expect ""several thousand."""
14320,But that is about it.
14321,"So, I rather have more data than less data."
14322,These vaccines are not like vitamins.
14323,They are serious drugs.
14324,So we should treat them as such.
14325,Yea me to.
14326,But it seems to always have surprises.
14327,Almost like it's a programmed algorithm.
14328,ü§î
14329,"You could make an argument that even without the minimal protection from a surgical or cloth mask (it may physically block a few viral particles, but without a seal like an N95 it won't be super effective), the act of wearing it indoors increases peer pressure for others to wear theirs indoors and thus decrease your chance of infection if it convinces an infected person to mask up that otherwise wouldn't have."
14330,"By no means a guarantee, of course."
14331,"And regarding your other comment on eyes, it's an interesting question."
14332,"I haven't seen any good data on how often infections are initiated in the eye vs the throat (it would likely require a study testing both tissues for SARS\_nCoV\_2 regularly to see if it shows up in one first more often than the other or even reliably in both together, if anyone has seen such data I'd love to know), but unless every exposure that results in an infection always infects the eyes as well as the nose/throat, then N95 mask will still decrease your risk by helping to block the situations where just the nose/throat would have been initially infected."
14333,"Though we don't have that data to my knowledge, I would hypothesize it is the case that a significant portion of infections start in the nose/throat without infecting the eye initially (aka: preventable by an N95) because as a matter of living we constantly suck in air over those regions, whereas the eye does not."
14334,Is it worthwhile for you to wear an N95 in higher risk situations once fully vaccinated?
14335,"That's a personal choice, I'm not telling you what to do."

14337,Covid was never killing or hospitalizing children en masse.

14341,We‚Äôre not going back to lockdown because of delta variant.
14342,We will stay reopened.
14343,Only thing that will change this is Delta is putting vaccinated people in hospital or there‚Äôs a new variant that is making vaccine ineffective.
14344,"you should keep going - when we have variant lambda, haz mat suit is the way."

14370,I was really hoping it could get up to 90%+...
14371,"No, (presumably) you and I got vaccinated to protect ourselves from the dummies."
14372,"Masking kids has no bearing on the vaccinated, and I don‚Äôt know what you expect for the rest."
14373,They‚Äôve made a willful choice to roll the dice.
14374,Saying they can still spread it so kids have to mask is an argument for doing this in perpetuity.
14375,You said ‚Äúthe flu is more dangerous to kids than COVID‚Äù also said ‚Äúits still pretty sad the kids have to go on wearing masks‚Äù.
14376,Choose one.
14377,"Oooh Canada; the country that legislated what you must say, and how to say it."
14378,The country that keeps finding mass unmarked graves from its past.
14379,"Yeah...I don't think they are quite the standard, or even a good example of protecting individual freedoms, that I was looking for."

14391,"That magical combination of poor critical thinking with selfishness, and a little dose of brainwash."
14392,Thank you for saying this.
14393,I have an 18 month old.
14394,I live in Florida.
14395,It's been a nightmare.
14396,"I actually got asked ""well you decided to have children in a pandemic""."
14397,No.
14398,No.
14399,I didn't.
14400,I had him in January before the pandemic and have been slowly dying inside ever since.
14401,Honestly I don't know how much longer I can take living in Florida.
14402,I can testify to this.
14403,My entire family including myself were sick back in February and I made the mistake of looking up experiences from other people.
14404,"""If they're alive and typing, then they must be well now, right?"""
14405,"Instead I kept reading about people who had lost loved ones who seemed to be getting better, and on the 7-10 day mark, they got worse suddenly and passed away."
14406,"I cannot express the sheer terror I was experiencing every second of my existence, and continued to do so for about 2 weeks."
14407,I was thinking any second one of my parents might get sicker.
14408,I would wake up at night and sneak near their room to listen if their breathing sounded normal.
14409,"I ended up having a panic attack at night while reading stuff, which obviously made my breathing go haywire so I immediately though ""welp that's it, I'm dead""."
14410,I then started taking sleeping medication to knock myself out overnight and make sure I don't continue my nightly paranoia parties.
14411,"I've lost two grandparents to COVID, so the fear was doubled by that tragedy as well."
14412,"But yeah, lesson learned: DON'T read up on this while you're sick, it will drive you insane."
14413,Almost nobody cares.
14414,Some people wear masks in *some* places and that's about all that's changed.
14415,"Everything is open: bars, malls, movie theaters - there are concerts for large crowds being held regularly."
14416,"There are mask and temperature checks in some places, but everyone immediately takes them off before and after."
14417,"So, a huge chunk of people doesn't think COVID is a big deal even as they lie in a hospital with a fever from it (I know such people firsthand)."
14418,"Then there is of course the regular anti-vaxxers who ""oppose any chemicals put in their bodies for any reason!"""
14419,"Finally you have the people who *do* treat COVID seriously, *do* trust the vaccines but aren't in a hurry to get one made in Russia because of insuccificient clarity of testing and lack of approval by EU and WHO."
14420,"After the [FDA approval of aducanumab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aducanumab#Controversy), I'd be ""astounded"" if any drug candidate from a politically savvy pharma fails to get FDA approval."
14421,"By comparison to aducanumab, the vaccines are miracle drugs."
14422,[removed]
14423,"The government announced yesterday they are going to be donating the remaining AZ doses to poorer countries, so hopefully no more is wasted."
14424,Again with this ... except for children -- who are less likely to have negative impacts from COVID -- almost all those who are not getting vaccinated choose to do so.
14425,"Yes, there are some outliers based on health conditions, but it's a minute amount of people and they're not part of the problem."
14426,Anti-vaxers are.
14427,[removed]
14428,Who am I endangering besides people who dont want to be vaccinated?
14429,So what you're saying  is we can see a shift in excuses for people not getting it at the start of November.

14431,"This is serious, scientific business."
14432,[removed]
14433,Well right off the bat he doesn‚Äôt (as far we know) have the disease.
14434,Its like driving around with an out of date inspection sticker on your car.
14435,Do you know that some part of it won‚Äôt break in traffic and yeet you into another car?
14436,No.
14437,Is this the same thing as knowingly driving with said broken part?
14438,Also no.
14439,"Now this is probably considerably more likely on average to result in people being hurt, thus the stiffer penalty, but the assumption of ‚Äòwe can punish people as though they intended to do something‚Äô for things that they not only didnt intend, but straight up couldn‚Äôt have done is just not how any conception about ‚Äòthe punishment matching the crime‚Äô works."
14440,"I've not heard of delta being less deadly

Can you link me"
14441,"Yeah, I‚Äôm not sure why that‚Äôs difficult to understand."
14442,I won‚Äôt judge you for masking your kid.
14443,Have at it!
14444,I just don‚Äôt think you should get to judge it for everyone else.
14445,Man go out and have fun.
14446,Enjoy life - you only get one.
14447,You went your whole life with a near magical body that fights off diseases and viruses every day.
14448,You've gone to concerts in the past and haven't died I hope.
14449,You've been vaccinated - don't let fear control you.
14450,Worst case scenario you get sick for a few days but saw a damn awesome show.
14451,I think it is more like that it's impossible to predict demand with 100% accuracy.
14452,"Canada just donated a bunch of AZ, it's not like we're letting it all rot."
14453,I believe we will donate a bunch of unused Moderna too shortly.
14454,When haven‚Äôt ‚Äúthe poor are being left behind‚Äù.
14455,"‚ÄúThe private school system is far superior‚Äù

This is a myth"
14456,[removed]
14457,"It's almost like a man of his credentials would be involved in the development to basically the end of the pandemic, and he wouldn't be allowed to publicly just give out all information"
14458,That's exactly what many employers will do.
14459,The only reason they haven't already is because of the legal hassle of forcing employees to take a non-FDA approved vaccine.
14460,I'm not diminishing the effectiveness of masks - they absolutely do work - my kids wear them whenever they're indoors.
14461,"But if you're going to mandate anything, you mandate the cure i.e."
14462,"the vaccine, you don't mandate the mitigation."
14463,"And I've asked this before, how many waves did masks prevent?"
14464,"Even in places with almost perfect masking, COVID still ravaged them during the previous surges."
14465,They are imperfect at the group level and they will not prevent a surge.
14466,"I absolutely encourage anyone who feels that they need to mask, to mask."
14467,But I don't think group-level masking is the solution that people are making it out to be - it certainly hasn't proven to be preventative at that level.
14468,So what?
14469,"Everyone on this planet is going to acquire immunity to Covid, either through vaccination or by rolling the dice through infection (or both in some cases) because it seems experts believe it‚Äôs endemic."
14470,Saying ‚Äúkids have to mask because of community spread‚Äù when nobody else has to wear them puts the burden of stopping it on them.
14471,It‚Äôs wrong and hinging the decision to open or close schools on it is a false choice.
14472,Get the vaccine and it's very unlikely you'll die from the virus.
14473,"That's it, the end."
14474,[removed]
14475,Fully vaccinated (55) with 2 teens also fully vaccinated.
14476,One went out to dinner with vaccinated friends last Wednesday and one of the friends has now tested positive.
14477,His family is sick.
14478,"Getting her tested in a couple of hours, she‚Äôs got some mild symptoms."
14479,I‚Äôm assuming this is Delta variant.
14480,Any point in trying to quarantine within the household?
14481,Seems pointless to me but she‚Äôs really beating herself up and putting on her mask probably makes her feel as if she‚Äôs protecting me.
14482,She‚Äôs angry and frustrated after doing all the right things for more than a year.
14483,"In Canada, healthcare workers are required to get vaccinated for various diseases."
14484,"That requirement, probably, already exists in other countries."
14485,Are you aware of this?
14486,I don‚Äôt need to read this to know it‚Äôs a moral failure since a lot of countries are proceeding with AZ (without mixing it up) and are still lagging behind.
14487,[removed]
14488,my guess is they kept these doses in case someone who originally got AZ (before it was discontinued) wants AZ as their second.
14489,I think having them expire was the tradeoff of maintaining the option of choosing one vaccine for both doses.
14490,"Yes, Sinovac gets the job done pretty damn well, unfortunately media likes to spit a lot of bullshit out, just like with Sputnik, any vaccine right now is great."
14491,"We aren‚Äôt doing this to ‚Äúprotect the dummies.‚Äù

We do it to **protect ourselves and our children** from the dummies."
14492,‚ÄúDing dong‚Äù adults aren‚Äôt why we have masks and other mitigation measures **in schools**.
14493,"I mean, other than the fact that half of Californians still aren‚Äôt fully vaccinated, and millions of kids under 12 are unvaccinated."
14494,"Actually I think we're on Lambda now, it just hasn't spread much yet."

14496,"The whole world was locked down because of COVID,  we need to make vaccination mandatory for anyone wishing to return to society."
14497,"This is kindergarten level stuff too, if you're not willing to be a part of the solution why should we accommodate you."
14498,"So much sacrifice and death worldwide, Antivaxx people need to be boxed in for their stupidity."
14499,Seriously?
14500,Freedom and debate can only flourish with laws and rules.
14501,I recommend getting a gas detector.
14502,They can be for propane and natural gas.
14503,They will notify you of any gas leaks.
14504,"Well, yes, but they weren't available."
14505,I got mine 3 weeks before my peers and I'm still only getting the second one tomorrow.
14506,"Although, since this guy isn't that bright, it's possible he refused his."
14507,Good stuff.
14508,Make life difficult for those who are unvaccinated üëèüèº
14509,"Bring them to Mexico, they'll gladly be used here"
14510,they need to hurry up and do it so school districts can make it mandatory
14511,I've been vaccinated for months and will gladly take a booster when/ if the time comes but vaccine passports are asinine.
14512,I'm really not interested in showing papers to do basic things.
14513,It is a typical thing to hava VERY reckless attitude regarding ones health in Russia.
14514,Not only towards Corona but in general.
14515,Many people are fatalists and believe in fate.
14516,"I know there are plenty of delinquent people outright refusing it out of pride, but this would get plenty of skeptics over the line."
14517,I can not wait.
14518,"First and foremost, acetaminophen has a dangerously low therapeutic dose to harm ratio."
14519,"1X dose is what you are supposed to take, 3-4X therapeutic dose is enough to kill you."
14520,It has to do with the cascade of how your liver processes the drug - you have enough enzymes right until you don't and it creates a dangerous intermediary product.
14521,Acetaminophen is in many different drugs.
14522,Bad cold?
14523,You take some tylenol - maybe a pill or two more than you were supposed to because you feel really bad.
14524,And then you decide to double down and load up on Dayquil.
14525,And your allergies have been acting up and you take Benadryl.
14526,You feel better from all the drugs and you go out with your coworkers and have a drink after work (which reduces the enzymes available to break down the drug).
14527,You do this a couple of days in a row and all the sudden you start becoming jaundiced because.. you have acute liver failure.
14528,"We've gotten better with warning labels, but it is frighteningly easy to overdose on acetaminophen."
14529,"Many, many drugs have it in it and it doesn't take *that* much extra to cause serious problems, especially if you happen to be on the lower end of the LD50 curve."
14530,And the issue is it doesn't cause immediate issues: it damages your liver which can take multiple days to manifest.
14531,Many people over-consume over the counter drugs under the assumption they are safe and that more is better.
14532,And usually that's pretty true.
14533,"You can take 30 sudafeds in a day (instead of 8) and you may get some heart palpitations, but it won't kill you."
14534,If you take 30 tylenols (instead of 8) in a day - especially more than one day in a row - you will end up in the hospital with acute liver failure.
14535,"While some are intentional overdoses, there are over 25,000 hospitalizations from acetaminophen overdoses each year."
14536,"If caught early enough and the overdose isn't too severe, we can typically save the liver with treatments."
14537,"But for many, by the time they get to the hospital it is too late: they either get a liver transplant or they die within a week or two."
14538,No mutation to date has significantly altered mRNA vaccine efficacy against severe infection.
14539,Vector vaccines have done worse but i suspect this is due to AZ not using a perfusion stabilized spike and JJ being single dose.
14540,UK new case rate has continued to rise starting early May with the death rate only modesty going up.
14541,Delta has mutated enough to reduce neutralizing antibody response (and give it a fitness advantage over Alpha) but not nearly enough to cause widespread hospitalization and death.
14542,[removed]
14543,"I literally pointed out why the paper didn't agree with what he said in a sibling comment:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/oizn9w/most_fully_vaccinated_people_who_get_covid_delta/h51k18w/

It explicitly **isn't** saying that natural immunity is better."
14544,Did you actually read the study?
14545,Because I just did.
14546,[removed]
14547,Because it is on the heels of a myraid of restrictions from a virus that has been political.
14548,How much one cares about this virus has become an orthdoxy and a purity test.
14549,"Social media has also increased the volumn of voices talking about ""the dangers"" of vacinees"
14550,I can't speak for your social circles but I have never witnessed any of that type of response.
14551,"&amp;#x200B;

Also, at the end of the day why should that be more important than giving accurate and full information to people who do want to take measures to limit their own risk?"
14552,The CDC has continually cratered their legitimacy over this entire pandemic because they allow politics to drive their messaging instead of data.
14553,"If they are worried that acknowledging that the vaccines aren't 100% effective will hurt vaccine uptake the answer is to create messaging that addresses that concern, not to lie and refuse to acknowledge that the vaccines aren't going to prevent every single person from ever getting infected."
14554,Let's hear your understanding of fairness then.
14555,Imagine this guy's behavior leads to 20 deaths which can all be proven without a doubt.
14556,Should he be charged and if so with what?
14557,"but you dont end up in the ICU so it doesnt matter, right?!"
14558,/s
14559,They probably spent barely any money on education in those countries.
14560,Ok so you're just arguing in bad faith.
14561,Got it.
14562,Some details?
14563,One dose of which vaccine?
14564,How long has it been since that shot?
14565,"If it was from a 2-dose vaccine, really the protection from 1-shot is already well known to be weak against delta."
14566,"Yep, this is well beyond just surgeons."
14567,"The study involves mild cases too, in which people who are vaccinated (especially if they only have the first dose) are still at risk, even if much lesser."
14568,"Point us, until vaccination (two shots) goals have been met, there's little reason to not still wear a mask and follow social distancing."
14569,[removed]
14570,Honest question.
14571,I grew up going to school in Texas.
14572,Is this a conservative policy?

14580,I live in Ireland and we're getting 1 million of those unused Romanian doses.
14581,"We're grateful for them, and they'll otherwise go to waste, but it's not ideal for Romania."
14582,Surgeons have required vaccines for years
14583,You are arguing something unrelated to the the subject.

14610,You keep relying to me *shrug emoji guy*
14611,That's what I was thinking too.
14612,People are probably hesitant after hearing the second dose can be pretty brutal.
14613,All I got was a whelp.
14614,"Most of the people I know didn't experience any symptoms, just a bit of soreness."
14615,There's no actual evidence that's what has happened here.
14616,PHE has done analysis finding the Delta to possible be more likely to hospitalize people than the previous variants.
14617,Deaths and hospitalizations are just way down because vulnerable populations are heavily vaccinated.
14618,You think dictators care about citizens dying pointlessly
14619,the Delta variant has been in the US for months now and is the dominant strain and yet deaths continue to decline.
14620,viruses ALWAYS mutate to become less deadly - not the opposite.

14622,"&gt;THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) ‚Äî Coronavirus infections in the Netherlands skyrocketed by more than 500% over the last week, the country‚Äôs public health institute reported Tuesday."
14623,The surge follows the scrapping of almost all remaining lockdown restrictions and the reopening of night clubs in late June.
14624,"&gt;The weekly update showing that nearly 52,000 people in the Netherlands tested positive for COVID-19 over the past week came a day after caretaker Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte apologized for the June 26 lockdown relaxation and called it ‚Äúan error of judgment.‚Äù"
14625,"My bet is, they will do the same in the western democracies."
14626,"Not directly, like Turkmenistan, but rather indirectly."
14627,"You ""don't have to"" take the vaccine, but they will gradually make your life hard if you don't."
14628,"Work/schools/universities will require vaccines, so will malls, caf√©s, cinemas, theatres, concerts etc."
14629,Want to make a bet that cases won't be up to 100+ when the 7 day average reflects this week?
14630,Because we both know it's headed up and not down but only I seem to be talking about it.
14631,Same in Denmark.
14632,1055 tested positive yesterday and the positive percentage was at it's highest in 11 months.
14633,No it won‚Äôt next
14634,"Per the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/vaers/index.html), the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is used to collect reports of adverse events after vaccination from the general public."
14635,This is primarily used to identify potential topics to further investigate with regards to vaccine reactions.
14636,"However, because the event data in VAERS is often not verified and is often self-reported, it should not be assumed that the adverse events in VAERS are actually associated with or cause by the vaccines, nor is it possible to estimate the frequency of these adverse events from these data."
14637,"*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically."
14638,Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) if you have any questions or concerns.
14639,*
14640,"Yes, the FDA and CDC safety guidance."
14641,The reason VAERS exists is so that they can follow up and look for unusual trends in the data.
14642,The data isn't being ignored - it is being investigated where there are unusual patterns.
14643,"The fact that GBS, the blood clot issue with JnJ, and the heart inflammation has been detected (all low probability events) shows that this data (and other data - medical records and trends) is being monitored and investigated where appropriate."
14644,"If there are merits to the events having a potentially causal relationship to the vaccines, they publicly disclose this information."
14645,"The fact that this is the ""worst"" (not to understate the blood clot issue) that has been found shows how safe the vaccines are given the sample size and number of adverse reports submitted."
14646,Thats awful üòû
14647,"Its more of a point about the hypocrisy about telling students what to wear while also letting students dictate that they can do whatever they want regarding masks, especially since one is a meaningless dress code and the other is about safety and public health during the middle of a deadly pandemic."
14648,"It‚Äôs all good, I get it."
14649,"If it involves actual medical advice not to proceed with a vaccine, the person in question has something pretty serious going on."
14650,Very true.
14651,[removed]
14652,The interpretation changes when you look at the age curves.
14653,"France is not much behind Spain in total vaccinations, but that's because all EU countries have so far been supply-constrained and therefore progressing at the same pace (since deliveries are quite homogenous throughout the EU)."
14654,But when you look at vaccinations by age ranges you see that in Spain all eligible age ranges trend towards &gt;90% vaccination (close to 100% for over 60 years) and the ones not vaccinated are almost all in the lower age ranges that have simply not had a chance to get vaccinated so far.
14655,"However, in France vaccination has been opened to pretty much everybody for a long time because demand dried out for the older age groups."
14656,Vaccination is now progressing for younger people while an important percentage of eligible people did not get the vaccine of their own decision.
14657,This means that France will soon get to a point where demand lags behind the supply whereas in Spain that point will likely be reached only when almost everybody is fully vaccinated.
14658,Oh I know and that's all logical people want.
14659,"Yeah, its true, there are articles on CNN and other outlets about it."
14660,"&gt; On the other side the fact that this isn't ""fully approved"" is holding us back from advancing our vaccination effort."
14661,It's just an excuse.
14662,The second it's approved they'll find another excuse.
14663,It was never really about FDA approval.
14664,They'll just add the FDA into the conspiracy.
14665,Great move.
14666,"Nepal is a wonderful and unique culture, yet still quite an impoverished nation."
14667,And their proximity to India has been potent for transmission.
14668,What a waste that people who have easy access to vaccines aren‚Äôt making use of them.
14669,"Those vaccines remain in the US, while people around the world are dying because smaller countries can‚Äôt negotiate the supplies they need."

14673,Probably pointing out a demographic that tends to lean more right.
14674,They expire after a certain amount of time and the goal is get as many people vaccinated as soon as possible.
14675,"Hence, here we are."
14676,The province did absolutely nothing wrong in that.
14677,Read the article.
14678,Headline is sensationalized.
14679,"They found one guy to say maybe with no evidence to actually back it up, just a hunch based on the 2nd shot, which is given in much shorter interval after the 1st than a booster would be."
14680,"I'm all for investigating side effects of a booster, but the headline makes it sound like they have more evidence of side effects than they actually do and is super misleading."

14780,"yes, the question is how much younger they are skewing and how much the overall case count goes up because, again, I gave examples of how they were skewing younger for the winter surge.... and it still ended up as a horrible time for hospitalizations and deaths."
14781,It was not a good idea to use a standard QR code for proof.
14782,That is easy copy paste work.
14783,A lot of young people also had the Janssen vacine what only need 1 shot bit takes 14 days to evolve in the body.

14800,People who work at hospitals should not be unvaccinated and spreading covid to their patients.

14877,The majority of cases for unvaccinated people are non-severe cases.
14878,I'm not sure that this article or the WHO is telling us much with this.
14879,It's not giving us comparisons to the unvaccinated.
14880,It's not a government fuckup.
14881,The shipments of the two vaccines were not in sync.
14882,"There was a massive influx of Moderna in June and very little Pfizer, and what compounds the issue is the 12-17 age group is cannot be given Moderna, so that age group had to all be given Pfizer."
14883,There's nothing anyone can do about that.
14884,These vaccines are not produced and shipped at the same rate.
14885,Variability is completely normal.
14886,"The only thing one can do when you have a mismatch in vaccines is either wait or mix vaccines, and mixing seems to be the better option."
14887,Even my grandparents who got their first doses in April only waited about 3 months.
14888,"Personally I was at exactly 8 weeks interval, and some of my friends who got later 1st dose appointments ended up waiting less than I did since my province moved to a 4-week interval as of last week (and walk-in clinics have been doing this for over a month)."
14889,"People got spooked by the NACI recommendation that up to 16 weeks was acceptable, but I genuinely wonder if anyone in the entire country *actually* had a 4 month dosing interval."
14890,Vaccine is effective against those.
14891,90+% of people contracting the delta variant are unvaccinated.
14892,How Bout az?
14893,"When I was able to schedule my first vaccine appointment, my calendar entry read ""deusnefum gets full body vaxxed"""
14894,"And if you flip over to 7-day average of new doses, all but Bulgaria and Romania are vaccinating at at least twice the number in the US, so many more will be passing US (Germany is due to overtake in about 4-5 days if current rates hold) - the EU average would overtake US in about 26 days."
14895,"But this does somewhat hide the fact that EU, like the US, does have a anti-vax/vaccine hesitancy problem."
14896,"Now, Romania is selling the doses it can't give out to Denmark, so overall it's proceeding nicely, but there will be a situation where most of Western Europe reaches great coverage levels, with places in the East lagging horrible behind (Bulgaria and Romania) or just at somewhat lower levels."
14897,My husband was kinda acting like an ass last night.
14898,"When we were going to bed he had chills so bad he was shaking, and the last time this happened was back in November when he got COVID, so I immediately asked him if he had any other symptoms and was feeling okay."
14899,He insisted he was fine and wasn‚Äôt contagious.
14900,"After pestering him a bit more, it turns out he finally decided to get vaccinated yesterday morning and was having some side effects!"
14901,"He kept saying he was going to wait a year or so and was concerned about long term effects/the vaccine being rushed, so I was very surprised last night when I figured out he had gotten vaccinated earlier that day."
14902,And I‚Äôm pretty happy about it.
14903,"Ugh, I hate this for you."
14904,I‚Äôm the same way.
14905,It feels unethical for them to ask you to come in.

14919,"Oh for sure, pretty much every newspaper was describing some sort of near-future where the Canadians would be looking at their friends in the US gathering and going on vacations while we were still in lockdowns."
14920,Which turned out to be sort of true; but only because the US's position on public health measures has ranged from lax to non-existent.
14921,In the end the large gap that was predicted never really materialized since their campaign stalled out so quickly.
14922,[removed]
14923,That‚Äôs where we‚Äôre at right now.
14924,i suppose you can't go live later then?
14925,I live in hope that my community will wake up one day and realize they‚Äôre idiots and get vaccinated asap.
14926,And that the kids‚Äô vaccine trials quickly lead to younger children getting vaccinated.
14927,Plus it‚Äôs just depressing thinking I will have a third summer masking.
14928,"It‚Äôs fine the rest of the year, but miserable when it‚Äôs hot and so humid that breathing through a mask is like breathing through a sweaty sock."
14929,AC isn‚Äôt great where I work.
14930,"It seems that  this also means the rate of infection is higher than we think, since asymptomatic people generally do not seek out tests unless they need one for medical procedures, travel, or whatever."
14931,"There are those who can‚Äôt get vaccinated yet because of other health conditions, so that‚Äôs not a great attitude to have."
14932,Not everyone who is not vaccinated are anti-vaxxers.
14933,"You aren‚Äôt going to like this, but I play soccer on the weekends in a beer league (Dads gotta keep in shape ya know) it took almost a month after quarantine to get my cardio back to where it was."
14934,On my runs I would make it probably quarter mile through my neighborhood and just stop because I was completely winded.
14935,I didn‚Äôt get back to a mile until like 3 weeks out of quarantine.
14936,After a month though I broke through the wall and have felt fine.
14937,"Note :

14938,"He also did not appear in court,   
and was sentenced in absentia to a prison term of one year and a fine of  
 ‚Ç¨4,000."
14939,"IANAL, but to my understanding a *trial in abstentia* automatically means that you have the right to a *retrial*  once arrested (But the previous trial can be used as a ground to keep you in jail/house arrest while waiting for the retrial)"
14940,"I‚Äôm sure there is an answer to this question, but I can‚Äôt figure it out by myself."
14941,I‚Äôm in the UK.
14942,"Here, it is my understanding that everyone over the age of 40, and everyone considered vulnerable to COVID, has been fully vaccinated."
14943,"If this is the case, then why does it matter that cases are rising in the UK?"
14944,Yes make them pay the price
14945,Smart company makes smart decisions.
14946,Can't be mad when they're following the laws...
14947,Bull.
14948,All of the governments in SEA had no other choice.
14949,"It's already been widely reported since last year about the queue for mRNA ones, or even AstraZeneca."
14950,"Heck, if AstraZeneca didn't get such a bad rep, SEA still wouldn't get it this early."
14951,SEA couldn't get the other vaccines because Western countries hogged them all and here you are accusing them at getting kickbacks as if they had a choice.
14952,The fact that families of vaccinated individuals test positivite with symptoms to COVID is frankly worrying to me.
14953,"Even if it reduces severe cases, I wish it was better and/or vaccines adapted to Delta variant were already available for who has to vaccinate yet instead of the ones to a vanished virus"
14954,what about immunocompromised people who cant get vaxxed safely?
14955,"i hope they have access to free testing, oof."
14956,"unless they smoke a lot of weed and get paranoid, ingesting most of their weird conspiracies while baked off their asses."

14959,Not quite true.
14960,No person born before 1970 has to get a measles vaccination.
14961,"Adults younger than that only have to get vaccinated if they work in a hospital, kindergarten, school or a refugees community home or are refugees themselves and are living in one."
14962,They made it hard for children not to get vaccinated though as they have to if they want to visit a kindergarten and if children go to school unvaccinated against measles their parents have to pay fines.
14963,And in Germany homeschooling is illegal outside of very rare exceptions so children have to go to school.
14964,"Because they care about facts and data and not the ""new"" sorting on the Coronavirus subreddit."
14965,"These things take time, as they should."
14966,[removed]
14967,"I had sepsis last year twice, once in April and again in November."
14968,Doctor currently says my white blood cell count is good again and not having all of the same symptoms I did last year.
14969,So I‚Äôm hoping it didn‚Äôt linger and make covid worse.
14970,"That‚Äôs a fear with sepsis unfortunately, never really getting the feeling that it‚Äôs fully gone away."
14971,I actually put off seeking treatment for covid at the hospital because of the sepsis PTSD I am still experiencing.

14983,then i hope once we've all been infected it just calms the f*ck down and turns into a common cold.
14984,the omega strain.
14985,No wonder American health care costs so much.
14986,All that money spent training surgeons and then they only get to do one surgery before suffocating under a mask üôÑ
14987,"It‚Äôs been a big disappointment, no doubt."
14988,I believe a few career CDC employees quit when the CDC enabled everyone to take their masks off.
14989,I‚Äôd love to know what was said in those rooms.
14990,"If it‚Äôs ok to get ‚Äúmild‚Äù covid, then why the fuck did we do ANY of this?"
14991,"The lockdowns, the remote learning, the work from home, etc?"
14992,The vast majority are only at risk for ‚Äúmild‚Äù covid!
14993,I was in Stockholm for the weekend (from Switzerland) and it really didn't feel like there were any measures at all.
14994,The only time I saw masks was at the terminal in the airport.
14995,"Did feel nice experiencing ""normal"" life again though for a few days."
14996,Hubby and I got our second shots this last Saturday.
14997,SUCH a huge weight off my mind.
14998,&lt;3
14999,The CDC has consistently been slow to adapt their recommendations to new data (ex.
15000,"They were glacially slow to admit that outdoor transmission and surface transmission were rare, even when we had the data to indicate that for many months)."
15001,I suspect they will also be slow to amend any recommendations they might change in response to new variants.

15007,It's effective at pushing hesitant people over the edge.
15008,The EU seems to be trying everything to make vaccination mandatory without having to say it out loud.
15009,"Kids under 12 didn't ""make their choice""."
15010,&gt;Remind me what happened the during last wave when the state had 62% of adults fully vaccinated?
15011,"In every wave, as cases went up for unvaccinated people, hospitalizations and deaths went up."
15012,"In this wave, most cases will ALSO be among unvaccinated people."
15013,So why are you expecting unvaccinated people who get infected to not have hospitalizations and deaths?
15014,What about kids under 12 or immunocompromised people who cannot get the vaccine?
15015,not enforced in practice as none executed since 2015 (I think)
15016,It was in a big study of collated studies to date.
15017,I am too hungover to move but I‚Äôll dig it out later if I remember.

15040,I had a similar experience in Mexico.
15041,The test seemed far less intrusive than a previous one (where there wasn't an incentive to have negative results).
15042,"Data is going to get skewed, if it hasn't already."
15043,"That said, the threshold for positive was pretty low when this all started going down, when there was incentive to have positives (more funding)."
15044,"SOEs are not private, that‚Äôs the whole point."
15045,"You can call it ‚Äúgovernment‚Äù land, but all that means is that it‚Äôs not privately owned land."
15046,It‚Äôs technically the people‚Äôs land.
15047,Calling it the ‚Äúgovernment‚Äôs‚Äù is a mischaracterization in that it leaves out the fact that it‚Äôs ‚Äúowned‚Äù by ‚Äúeveryone‚Äù so that ‚Äúno one‚Äù can individually/privately ‚Äúown‚Äù it.
15048,"So, there aren‚Äôt any owners of these SOEs that will be able to fly themselves to space like we have here."
15049,"And not all businesses in China are SOEs anyways, so its nothing that applies across the board."
15050,"The money might go to fund their space program, who knows."
15051,"Which is a good thing, along with all the public transport they are building."
15052,"I don‚Äôt know where you‚Äôre from, but in the US we do not have anywhere near the mobility of other countries including China."
15053,They aren‚Äôt ‚Äúputting it in their pockets‚Äù any more than our system of capitalism in the west freely ‚Äúputs‚Äù capital into the hands of private individuals.
15054,"And yeah, I know that trains exist in the United States."
15055,"Don‚Äôt be coy, they‚Äôre making a good investment and we could learn a lot from that."
15056,Everyone can have nice things.
15057,"Yes, and I live in Vegas where it‚Äôs spreading really bad."
15058,That‚Äôs fine.
15059,But don‚Äôt make five year olds play together in masks.
15060,The benefit is tiny and the learning loss is huge.
15061,Example: They won‚Äôt even let kids sing in school because it spreads air.
15062,As a result any kid too young to play an instrument gets no participatory music education.
15063,It‚Äôs awful.
15064,it's kinda funny cuz my mom was antivaxx but we still discussed rational subjects.
15065,i told her to watch israel because they were ahead of everyone else (so she could see if they all dropped dead).
15066,"she ended up youtubing some religious guy who was like 'take the vaccine don't be an idiot' and she started following him, and now she's fully vaxxed!"
15067,"sorry, i just had to share :P"
15068,There some additional protection beyond infection (though most of the vaccines' protection against hospitalization is in the protection against infection).
15069,"But the point remains the same - hospitalizations among vaccinated people are a certain fraction of overall hospitalizations;  as overall hospitalizations go up, so do hospitalizations among the vaccinated."
15070,"If the ratio is 20:1, for example, then for every 20 new hospitalizations, 1 should be for a vaccinated person."
15071,So it's still rational for vaccinated people to not want cases to go up.
15072,[deleted]
15073,And yet they seem to have money to keep hiring additional administrators with 6 figure salaries while their schools crumble
15074,That sucks.
15075,You can still get long covid and neurological issues or grey matter changes in your brain from asymptomatic cases.
15076,"Also, if the asymptomatic person is spreading to others they are contributing to the creation of variants and prolonging this whole situation for all of us."
15077,Because people are forgetful and/or stupid.
15078,[removed]
15079,[deleted]
15080,Same here.
15081,I live with my parents who are also vaccinated.
15082,"Since there's no one at home that are at risk (like young children) and we all already had COVID in December, I'm living a normal life while I can."
15083,"If a variant breaks through, it's unlikely (though very much possible) I'll get infected before cases start rising in vaccinated people."
15084,"I'm going to be wearing a mask during winter from now on just to protect my face from the cold, but I may extend that to mid-fall to mid-spring to protect against respiratory disease."
15085,But otherwise I plan to keep my daily routine the same.
15086,Many experts still think hospitals can overflow when all measures are relaxed.
15087,"What really makes my head hurt is that they fork out cash for these fakes when, for free, they could get the real thing."
15088,The stupid.
15089,IT HURTS.
15090,Kids are much more resilient than we give them them credit for.
15091,"They need the adults to set a good example for them and to explain why being cautious is important, and to not be upset about it."
15092,They get it.
15093,They will follow our lead.
15094,"And they would gladly sacrifice to keep others safe, unlike what we are seeing from so many adults."
15095,Are there challenges?
15096,Of course.
15097,But there are also silver linings just like with anything else  Many kids had so much more time with their parents this year with working from home and travel.
15098,"There are also of course kids that are in tough situations, and we do need to do what we can to support them."
15099,"We should have been doing that all along, covid or not."
15100,follow the statistics and the science...your kid will be fine.
15101,assuming he doesnt have underlying conditions which these kids in Miss likely had.
15102,but the media fails to contextualize anything these days.
15103,How much of the country was vaccinated then?
15104,"Low vaccination and zero masking‚Ä¶ everything‚Äôs back to ‚Äúold normal‚Äù

Edit: large parties, big events, bars, and restaurants packed."
15105,There is a lag time between cases and deaths.
15106,"Deaths were down at the beginning of the summer and winter surges, then the deaths eventually followed."
15107,[removed]
15108,"They are requiring masks on subways and buses in London, it will be mandatory üëç"
15109,"Don't know much about the Midwest in general, is it because of low vaccination or something else that you feel that it is going to be rough this fall?"
15110,"A far better solution than masks is HEPA air purifiers and ventilation, which have a lot more scientific evidence for preventing Covid transmission than cloth masks."
15111,Masks are leaky.
15112,Put a bunch of kids together in a poorly ventilated space for hours and they will end up breathing each others‚Äô infectious particles no matter what.
15113,Fitting them with N95 masks doesn‚Äôt seem realistic.
15114,Distancing and plastic barriers are also likely useless because those particles accumulate in the air for hours and circulate throughout the room.
15115,[removed]
15116,"If asymptomatic Covid was actually the absence of symptoms, however that‚Äôs not been what‚Äôs observed in several papers that show ground glass opacities in all asymptomatic cases (small retrospective study) as well as all pediatric patients who were asymptomatic had elevated inflammation markers - most of which were over the clinical threshold for TMA (low platelets, and organ damage due to the formation of microscopic blood clots in capillaries and small arteries)."
15117,"Granted the vaccine probably does something positive for asymptomatic cases, something that lots of people may not know is that even if they don‚Äôt notice symptoms that doesn‚Äôt mean bad things aren‚Äôt happening."

15119,It is a sensible warning.
15120,I pray that it is met by sensible responses.
15121,"Vaccines are technically under a different approval process than traditional pharmaceutical drugs, and instead are approved by a different process along with biologics."
15122,Well I hope she isn't allowed to travel.
15123,It doesn't help that a lot of the people who could flip the script leave the state for places that align with their politics.
15124,"I know a lot of leftist individuals here in California who say they ""escaped"" from Mississippi."
15125,"They also went to private schools so they had a leg up on the things the previous person mentioned (education, opportunity, no poverty)."
15126,The cdc should be following the science that shows you can still catch and spread COVID even while being vaccinated.
15127,Fuck this incentive  bullshit.
15128,It should be about the facts and keeping people safe.
15129,right on theme for this phony...consistently shuffling about
15130,Except the moderators in this sub take it to a whole new level!

15132,It's no secret the moderators here are awful.
15133,So while this doesn't encompass free speech I have to agree that the moderators here are limiting discussion relevant to the topic at hand.
15134,PA is still holding steady.
15135,"I expect we'll increase about the same amounts - we have about a million people who also didn't show up for their second shot, so that 70% full vaccination rate seems like it may not happen here."
15136,"How many times have we seen this at the beginning of waves, only for it to be wrong in the longer-term when deaths inevitably follow cases."
15137,"Once again... deaths lag cases by a large amount of time:

&gt;Why fewer people are dying of COVID-19, even as cases surge

&gt;**14 July 2020**  
&gt;  
&gt;Why are US coronavirus deaths going down as covid-19 cases soar?"
15138,The CDC never claimed you don't need to wear masks.
15139,"They claimed the disease was not severe enough on average to warrant a legal mandate if you're double vaccinated, which is not the same thing at all."
15140,There are so many caveats in that statement and society did not follow it properly whatsoever.
15141,"People who are unvaccinated stopped wearing masks and now the virus is spreading, raising the risk for people who are vaccinated as well."
15142,Masks are always really useful in reducing viral spread.
15143,The CDC has never said you don't need them.
15144,"They save lives which is a pretty strong statement in favour of wearing them, particularly in the case of a surge in cases due to a variant."
15145,It's a question of a legal mandate.
15146,"&gt;but somehow, NYTimes, rueters decided it's fun to portray SinoVac as worthless."
15147,"Yes, ""somehow"" wink wink."
15148,We all know the reason why.
15149,Its part of the cold war/ media war/ info war where they have resorted to telling lies to brainwash the population.
15150,Just common sense/ logic will already dispell almost 90% of what they claim about China.
15151,"In the case of sinovac, its literally made in the same way ALL VACCINES of the last 70 years have been made."
15152,"If sinovac doesnt work, then neither does the thousands and thousands of vaccines we have been getting of the last 70 years!"
15153,Do people even understand how crazy such claims are.
15154,Nope lol
15155,"At least in NYC, Staten Island is making up a large portion of new cases."
15156,It's a Republican area with low vaccination rates.
15157,The pdf might have digital signature...and in that case it is actually quite hard to forge
15158,That sucks that a new deadlier variant came out just as everyone started getting vaccinated.
15159,Yolo county
15160,"it sucks to say, but until we develop a vaccine that stops asymptomatic spread from the vaccinated Covid will always be here"
15161,"Sure, but that assumes people actually ever RTFA."
15162,I.. have my doubts.
15163,"Except kids under 12 are not going to magicaly infect each other without an adult in the chain, most likly an unvaxed one."
15164,"Even if it spreads to a bunch of kids at camp it then has to infect a highly vacinated set of adult parents, who then have infect even more vaxed parents."
15165,Keeps the chain pretty small.
15166,Correct.
15167,It takes 6 months of data in order to apply for full-use approval.

15175,\&gt; Controlling viral spread is in everyone's interest.
15176,Where did I say otherwise?
15177,You missed my point.
15178,Some people wanted to get vaccinated from the beginning and couldn't.
15179,The US government should be giving Pfizer *tons of money*.
15180,"They developed a world-saving vaccine, and should be rewarded handsomely for that."
15181,"If we penny-pinch, fewer firms will want to go out on a limb in the future."
15182,"But in any case, no, it's not a money grab."
15183,"I think two things happen:

1."
15184,"10 children on life support in one state really is a huge number compared to the pandemic at large, given the most deaths of American children for any month in the pandemic was 49."
15185,2.
15186,"People feel bad when kids suffer and especially now, when kids under 12 still can't get the vaccine and teens may be constrained by antivax parents."
15187,"I suspect sympathy for adults dying of COVID in America is very, very low because it's self-inflicted."
15188,"None of this changes what you're saying, which is that even with Delta being more serious, the absolute number of children on life support/dying of COVID remains very very low and the relative numbers are going to sound scarier than they are."
15189,"There is a phenomenon that because vaccines are training a child's immune system to fight one disease, the immune system might possibly gain some ""muscles"" through this training that improve its ability to fight other diseases as well:

https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200915-the-mystery-of-why-some-vaccines-are-doubly-beneficial

Maybe this is a similar effect?"
15190,What an incredibly French headline lmao
15191,&gt; They need to go back into lockdown again before they create a vaccine-resistant variant.
15192,I don't think that's necessary.
15193,A version of the virus that evades the vaccines is exceedingly unlikely because of how mRNA vaccines work.
15194,The wall we need to build is inside our borders.
15195,"He is still right, though."
15196,"An infected vaccined individual is far more likely to ""create"" vaccine resistant strains than an infected unvaccinated individual."
15197,Remeber what was said about Sputnik one year ago in all the media?
15198,"""A bad vaccine is worse than no vaccine, as it makes immune evasion more likely and can harm further vaccination efforts""."
15199,Mississippian here.
15200,Mississippi used to be very sensible about vaccinations; it‚Äôs one of the states that still has strict vaccination requirements for school enrollment.
15201,"I fully expect that requirement to become collateral damage to the current COVID vaccination debate and be scrapped completely in the near future, leading to surges in all kinds of fun childhood diseases."
15202,This is actually pretty interesting to think about.
15203,By not vaccinating children under 12 did we inadvertently nudge COVID (or COVID variants evolving in the US) down an evolutionary path to select for younger hosts?
15204,Or perhaps by having a partially vaccinated population we're forcing the newer more virulent strains that evolve outside the US to go straight for the easiest hosts - young kids.
15205,"Yeah, if your reaction is ""god what assholes"" instead of ""that's weird but I'll take it and what else can we do?"""
15206,maybe you should question whether you actually care about public health or you just care about your side being right.
15207,"This sounds a lot like last year, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt celebrate Halloween/thanksgiving/Christmas this year so we can all celebrate next year."
15208,"People are done, lots of us that got vaccinated are comfortable with the risk at this point and have returned to our old lives, it is what it is, and I‚Äôm sorry if that upsets people or makes me a bad person."
15209,All of my family and friends have been vaccinated at this point.
15210,The pharmacy generally closes at a different time than the actual CVS for what it's worth.
15211,Yes you do.
15212,You have a right to quit your job and not infringe on the rights of your patients who do not want a covid infection from your dirty ass.
15213,This would be really serious if they're under twelve years old.
15214,The total vax percentage is the most important for gauging safety but the other ones tell you what percent of *eligible* people have been vaxxed which is important for evaluating policy and the like.
15215,That sounds about right.
15216,Or maybe even less.
15217,"The people who set the goalpost of ""Well, as soon as it received OFFICIAL approval I'll get it"" will mostly just pick up the goalposts and move then another hundred yards and set some other inscrutable requirement."
15218,"Until that is met, then they'll move it again."
15219,"We've pretty much reached the point (in the US at least) that anyone who has an opportunity to get the vaccine (as in the right age group, and no allergic reaction or medical restriction) and STILL hasn't been vaccinated by this point, most likely never will."
15220,"It will just be a percent here, a fraction of a percent there and the very last holdouts that can be persuaded get it (probably so they can keep their jobs, or visit relatives or something like that - and then reluctantly)."
15221,"Most of the holdouts, at this point, will remain holdouts, regardless if the vaccine is fully approved or not."
15222,"I think the only thing that would move the needle at all at this point would be if a certain orange-colored individual were to go on a very vocal, extended public media campaign berating anyone who hasn't been vaccinated."
15223,And I wouldn't hold my breath on that ever happening.
15224,Fixed thanks
15225,But what about the kids who get sick?
15226,"They still count, sutely"
15227,My point of course is it don't really matter if post-vax covid is worse than a flu season.
15228,"However bad it is, that's as good as it's gonna get."
15229,This country is seriously going to shit.
15230,This is nothing more than culture war bullshit.

15232,The US hasn't had a significant increase in number of cases since the winter surge.
15233,"There was an increase of 33% sometime from March through April, but that's it."
15234,The deaths numbers reflect the sum of many probability waves.
15235,"When a person gets COVID, they have a chance to die."
15236,"However, more accurately, they have a particular chance to die on any day for the X number of days."
15237,"There is a certain day where they have the highest chance to die, but they continue to have less and less chance to die every day after that."
15238,"Let's say you have a million people get infected on January 1, and then nobody gets infected until February, where 100 people get infected each day."
15239,"The deaths graph will still be dominated by the January 1 infections, and there will continue to be less and less deaths every day, since there is less and less people that are expected to die from the January 1 infections with each passing day."
15240,"The actual February infections just aren't a significant contributor to the February deaths, and won't be until basically almost all of the January infections have been resolved."
15241,That explanation applies to why we didn't see a 33% increase in deaths during the period in the US in March/April.
15242,"This affect will still apply now, but will probably be overpowered pretty quickly -- we were only at 220 or so deaths a day, which isn't so much compared to the new daily cases we are getting."
15243,"So, this time we expect deaths to rise."
15244,Leave France then.
15245,I‚Äôm pretty sure Missouri could use more healthcare workers right now.
15246,Or maybe Tennessee.
15247,They really want everyone to be vaccine free there and just see what happens.
15248,Tennessee will respect your right to choose.
15249,Antibodies are good; they protect you.
15250,You don't want to get rid of them.
15251,Antigens are what antibodies attack - they're bits of the outside of the virus that can be observed by the immune system.
15252,"Antigen tests and genetic tests look for different parts of the virus and, in some patients, these parts can linger long after you stop shedding intact viruses that can infect others."
15253,Based on commentary from real virologists on the TWIV podcast I don't think this process is well understood so I'm afraid there likely isn't anything you can do other than just try to stay healthy.

15255,"Mississippi ranks really badly for a lot of public health factors (infant mortality, maternal outcomes after birth, obesity, diabetes, asthma too I believe)‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs possible that the kids of Mississippi are generally less healthy than kids in other places or are more likely to have underlying conditions that leave them extra-vulnerable to covid"

15266,I have been downvoted for saying this before.
15267,But I am saying it again.

And even then ""working its way through"" is not nearly as devastating."
15274,A truly terrible month for 0-17 deaths from COVID is like...20 people.
15275,"Whereas almost 1000 people 85+ died of COVID last month, three times the entire COVID death toll for American children."
15276,"Again, the point is that its still going up"

15278,Selfish
15279,The target of the government is only to innoculate the national capital region and other nearby provinces.
15280,We don't need 108 million doses.
15281,"Right now we are shifting to Pfizer, Moderna and JnJ."
15282,Idk I'd rather live under a benevolent dictator than in an ungoverned thunderdome like Somalia
15283,And we have limited ultra low temp storage.
15284,There's like no notice how much stock is coming so it is what it is.
15285,extremely well put my friend
15286,Not exactly.
15287,You‚Äôre hiding the main point being implied here which is that officials are changing their language when it comes to vaccine efficacy.
15288,Early on health officials were excited that data suggests that the vaccines actually prevent infection or produce asymptomatic cases.
15289,"Now it seems the standard has dropped considerably and the conversation has turned to the idea that you might catch it and get sick,   but not as many people will be hospitalized."
15290,The interviewee also said that people with co-morbidities and the elderly may need a booster.
15291,The government has other means than direct enforcement.
15292,It can up and tell federal employees and the military to vaccinate or be slowly reprimanded to eventual termination.
15293,The military especially needs this due to the close quarters soldiers live and work under in bases and on ships.
15294,Similarly OSHA could consider COVID precautions are a mandatory work safety issue and you either get your employees to be vaccinated or they will be required to be masked during work indefinitely.
15295,Failure to do this would constitute a violation of basic worker safety and the companies directly fined.
15296,If employers start racking up fines they'll quickly crack down on the antivaxxer bullshit amongst their employees.
15297,"Uh, what?"
15298,That's not even remotely related.
15299,I literally said that the approval process was rushed because it was.
15300,"The emergency approval process was absurdly rushed and even the vaccine makers, CDC, etc all state such."

15302,Haha I thought you had said country not county.
15303,Please disregard my note.
15304,That letter R is important.

15310,Lol.
15311,Delete Facebook.
15312,Not true.
15313,"We had a chance to get Pfizer last year, funny thing the head of our Department of Health sat on it for several months."
15314,"Take a look at Indonesia also, contract with sinovac is confidential and price was not allowed to be divulged."
15315,You sure are naive at how things are here.
15316,Btw the 40 million doses that our government finally ordered will arrive in August.
15317,"Yeah, we are fully opened in Vermont as well."
15318,"But we're taking care of each other still, just like we started staying home before we were closed, because we give a shit about the safety of our community."

15329,This is par for the course for the basic level of ignorance that exists in the common Tennessee citizen.
15330,They should game this out.
15331,"If they order the boosters and it turns out they're superfluous (which is looking more and more dubious every week), they can always donate them to a country in desperate need of vaccines, of which there are plenty."
15332,"If they DON'T order the boosters and Delta turns out to run even wilder than it has been, with more (and more severe) breakthrough cases as original-vaccine immunity begins to wane, then we'll see spiraling infection and death rates, and a vaccine bottleneck like we had to deal with earlier this year."
15333,"Combine that with a reluctance to lock down, even briefly, and things could get really, really ugly -- just in time for next year's midterm elections."

15345,"Well, I mean this was clear to happen at some point."
15346,Before large amounts of people were vaccinated the virus had no pressure to adapt to vaccines.
15347,But half a year ago the race has begun.
15348,"We have seen the virus to evolve within immunosuppressed people, trying to avoid their immunity."
15349,The same thing now happens in infected vaccinated people.
