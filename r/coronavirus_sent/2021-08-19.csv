3,Let’s deny care for std’s because people don’t use protection too!
4,!
5,"Obviously not, but on FB everyone tells you it's ""just 1% death rate"" or ""vaccine is leaky, will harm your DNA""."
6,The first time these people talk to anyone who has any idea what is reality is when they're in the ICU being intubated.
7,That's how it was last year.
8,This year now we get a daily email saying how many cases there were yesterday instead.
9,No.
10,You don’t need to show ID in many states.
11,Not everyone even has ID.
12,Your making crap up.
13,I really don't understand why posts with political comments are removed.
14,It's *all* political at this point.
15,Fuck 'em.
16,"They had their chance, they chose death/illness."
17,We need to respect their CHOICE
18,You mean unvaxed?
19,"Well, my district has been doing it via email."
20,"The companies/institutions that administered the vaccines definitely kept records, it's part of the process, they had to account for them, even the ones they threw away."
21,"That's how anyone can verify a card without having access to medical data, you can call the people that administered it and ask them if the vaccine lot listed on the card were in play on that day."
22,So you are definitely incorrect.
23,That is far from a given.
24,[removed]
25,"If you’re not vaccinated and don’t have an actual medical reason to not get it then yeah you’re a fucking plague rat and I also wish you’d die because you and everyone like you (your disease, your mentality, your ignorance, your ego) is a danger to our society."
26,What's the point of masks and social distancing if there's no way out anyway?
27,I'm pretty defeated.
28,"I'm vaccinated, trying to live my life, patiently waiting for anti-vaxxers to die."
29,I've sacrificed enough for them
30,"70% effective against infections, 100% effective against hospitalizations in the original clinical trial"
31,don’t you think it’s too soon to ask?
32,He said that he almost died from his stepsis….
33,"They likely will eventually, but we only dropped our mask mandate for a couple of weeks before it was reinstated."
34,"It wasn’t even dropped before until our numbers have been far, far lower than the recommended threshold."
35,I don’t imagine the mandate changing until cases across the country have stabilized.
36,"Regardless, mask usage has been consistently high here."
37,"Even when the mandate was dropped, 99% of people wore a mask indoors, besides bars and restaurants obviously."
38,"&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — Three senators said Thursday they have tested positive for COVID-19 despite being vaccinated, a high-profile collection of breakthrough cases that comes as the highly infectious delta variant spreads rapidly across the United States."
39,Almost every member of the Senate spent long hours together on the chamber’s floor last week in an all-night session of budget votes before leaving town for August recess.
40,The breakthrough cases emerged the day after U.S. health officials announced plans to dispense COVID-19 booster shots to Americans.
41,"Cancer, emergency surgery, accident, problems with birth... the potential problems abound."
42,May be wise to assume the worst of your locale if you have some kind of important elective coming up.
43,I have something I snagged the first possible date for on the off-chance this becomes an issue.
44,"I'm in a good area (for now) that tends to do the right thing, but aside from how a relatively few people can really mess things up &amp; how they're going far and wide for their ""oops"", best not to assume."
45,Just like the energy grid
46,&gt;	Are you telling me that they don’t consider patient’s history when prioritize for transplant?
47,Guess this didn’t come up over 2 months on a nephrology floor 😅
48,"Your submission has been removed as it is either a repost, clickbait or low quality submission."

53,"Of course, because he is in the pro-covid party."
54,No.
55,"They're figuring that 94% of people in the UK have antibodies and here in about 2-3 more weeks, our numbers should be similar."
56,I think this whole thing will be over around the end of the year and schools will not need to close down again.
57,"Here in the beginning, there will be a lot of quarantines, but they'll find that those quarantines lead to very few - if any - additional cases and they'll stop those, as well."
58,That's my guess.
59,Quarantines for exposure will end around Oct/Nov.
60,Transparency is the golden key to crisis communications.
61,I wondered if they’d slowed making it since they are supposedly not making a profit on it vs Moderna/Pfizer.
62,Now that there’s enough supply without them maybe they are stepping back.
63,it's what most of us have been thinking anyways.
64,[removed]
65,Lol
66,yes.
67,"I recall hearing that with the budget cuts to the CDC during the earlier parts of the Trump admin (a few years before the pandemic), the staff morale plummeted and a lot of top-performing team members left

Plus after the chaos of the past 18 months, I'd imagine the staffing and resource situation there is probably not ideal."
68,So the organizational capability might be a bit stunted
69,Yeah but do they know what’s in regeneron?
70,Yea like some sort of way to prep our body to be able to fight covid once it hits us.
71,Like a fire alarm drill before a fire.. we should call these magical panaceas v-a-c-c-i-n-e-s
72,Except then their criminal enterprises (police unions) will make sure they aren’t subject to those mandates just like how those unions make sure cops are never held accountable to the law for things like murder.
73,Nice routine if a bit mundane but wow on sticking that landing!

76,Is it any more of an ethical decision than basic triaging?
77,This is just adding another option for triage.
78,Last year we went to Halloween Horror nights at Universal and Howl-O-Scream at Busch Gardens.
79,"If we keep our masks on and we’re fully vaxed, is it more dangerous to go now with Delta or when we went last September with masks but not vacinated?"
80,I appreciate your detailed response more than you know.
81,Thank you.
82,Is he a literal demon?
83,"don't tell the anti-vax that, they'll come at you with their tik tok doctor skills"
84,Same boat as you.
85,A boat I don’t want to be on.
86,I SO BADLY wish I could go to a pharmacy and get a mRNA booster.
87,This is freaking me the hell out.
88,No mention of how many children are in ICU in Dallas testing positive for COVID-19.
89,Anyone know where to find that number?
90,Swine flu.
91,"Yeah, there's such a woolly array of definitions of 'long covid', it's impossible to pin down right now."
92,Studies estimating 'long covid' prevalence between 5% and 70% - that's a uselessly large range - methodological anarchy.
93,"Agree that psychological impacts are likely to be a good bit of the 'fatigue/lethargy' portion of it, but there also seem to be some distinct physical components including post-ventilation trauma and lung scarring in severe cases, the impact of infection along the olfactory and other nerves, potentially impacts from blood clotting, and long lasting defective immune responses."
94,You know what else is fun?
95,Not dying or getting debiliated due to a disease we have vaccines for!!!
96,WHAT AN AMAZING CONCEPT!
97,!
98,\- I hope that the government will decide to make vaccinations compulsory - said the chairman of the Medical Council at Prime Minister prof. Andrzej Horban.
99,Prof.
100,"When asked about the forecasts for the fourth wave of coronavirus infections, Andrzej Horban replied that he predicted a milder course than during the spring wave."
101,"- Several, several thousand."
102,"Let me remind you that we had about 30,000 infections a day, it was horrendous."
103,"I don't think there will be even 15,000."
104,It depends on many factors.
105,Now we have a total relaxation - said the  prime minister's chief advisor for combating the pandemic.
106,"When asked about the introduction of obligatory vaccinations in Poland, prof. Horban replied, ""Our hand itches to recommend mandatory vaccinations for certain groups that are at risk of infection."""
107,"\- As soon as the time comes, we will start compulsorily vaccinating - he announced."
108,He added that a change in the attitude of the authorities should be expected.
109,There will be groups that will have to be vaccinated.
110,- I hope that the government will decide to make these vaccinations compulsory - he said.
111,"\- We are divided because there are people who believe that the fact of falling ill is a sufficient punishment, sometimes this punishment is fatal - he added."
112,"\- As long as we have 200 infected a day, we can focus on convincing (for vaccinations) - said prof. Horban."
113,"- With 1000 cases a day, we will stop sounding the alarm."
114,We will be very clearly introducing restrictions - he added.
115,I hope you are right.
116,"As an ER nurse in the northeast, we have been seeing a fair number of covid patients returning from Colorado."
117,I understand the hippocratic oath but your cancer patient's cancer or the habits that got him there aren't going to kill someone else.
118,Same for your obese patients.
119,Same for your renal failure patient.
120,"Other than the emotional and physical toll on their families, which I'm told is generally survivable, their choices will not kill others (besides the consideration of 2nd hand smoke, so fuck that guy too if he smoked around his family, but anyway...)

&amp;#x200B;

COVID antivaxxers choices can kill others, full stop."
121,And now they're taking needed hospital beds from your first 3 patients who are now likelier to die.
122,So screw em.
123,All of them.
124,I'm glad you'll care for them but I'm not sad if they get put where they belong in the back of the line.
125,"I would say the same for pedophiles, murders, rapists and anyone else, say, waiting for a kidney transplant if there were objectively better human beings also waiting for the same treatment."
126,"And while we're at it, why are they even coming to the hospital?"
127,Don't they distrust medicine?
128,"You now have to deal with their conspiracy believing families, too - I have enough RN and doctor friends to know these are the worst patients and their entourages you can have right now."
129,"Again, good for you for doing your job when they're in your care but for real many of us don't give a single shit if their time is up."
130,Meanwhile I hope you don't get COVID from them and their combative anti-mask families.

135,I think the risk of transmission is significantly lower for vaccinated people but it is occurring whereas other vaccines prevent that.
136,I referenced it in another comment but the vaccine and immunology experts have all agreed herd immunity is impossible at this point and the next strain is likely to be much more contagious among vaccinated people so yeah I don’t think they’re even trying to aim for  herd immunity anymore
137,Me thinks we’ll be needing boosters forever.
138,Just like the flu shot every fall is probably a good idea.
139,Maybe I’m just planning on the worst and will be pleasantly surprised?
140,There was so much hope in the early summer; life was grand for about a month.
141,"Then, Delta paid us a visit…"
142,"Desantis is right though, early treatment does save lives.. aka prophylactic/preventative measures... like saaaay a vaccine maybe?"
143,"JFC, this!"
144,^
145,"&gt;  it becomes an endemic virus that kills off the unvaccinated

Pretty much, and I'm beginning to wonder about the effect on the probate courts."
146,"It could, in one sense, change the actuarial tables for life insurance underwriters, and might even provide unintended relief to the social security trust funds."
147,"Sucks to finally reach the age when you are fully vested, then never get to draw much of it."

151,"From the Bloomberg article:

&gt;a research paper that languished in publishing limbo for a year and a half contains meticulously collected data and photographic evidence supporting scientists’ initial hypothesis—that the outbreak stemmed from infected wild animals—which prevailed until speculation that SARS-CoV-2 escaped from a nearby lab gained traction."
152,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt;According to the report, which was published in June in the online journal Scientific Reports, minks, civets, raccoon dogs, and other mammals known to harbor coronaviruses were sold in plain sight for years in shops across the city, including the now infamous Huanan wet market, to which many of the earliest Covid cases were traced."
153,"The data in the report was collected over 30 months by Xiao Xiao, a virologist whose roles straddled epidemiology and animal research at the government-funded Key Laboratory of Southwest China Wildlife Resources Conservation and at Hubei University of Traditional Chinese Medicine."
154,"In other words, 18-months later the most reasonable explanation for the origin of COVID-19 has even more supporting evidence."
155,Just like organ donations.
156,Same here.
157,"I understand things are rough for people, but I just don't get it."
158,Some people have real health issues and have needed to take these precautions the whole time.
159,It really isn't the end of the world.
160,and thots?
161,What makes you say this?
162,We've almost peaked with delta.
163,The Rt is dropping and spread is slowing dramatically.
164,"We're likely less than two weeks out from the peak (yes, some local places will peak later, but I imagine everywhere will peak by mid-September and overall cases will start dropping within the next 10 days or so, based on a lot of the data that's coming out)."
165,Lock downs aren't coming back anywhere.
166,The CDC not just shutting up and admitting they don't have the data for making these kind of assertions is part of the reason so many people who won't get the vaccine say they're being lied too.
167,"Like obviously it's more complicated than that and the CDC wants to inform people, but jfc their PR skills are garbage."
168,There's a paywall.
169,"Anyways, without the article, the patients that are most sick would most likely be the unvaccinated patients."
170,Needed now more than ever.
171,For example.
172,CIA is going to remain active in Afghanistan and hopefully head off another 9/11.
173,One could argue that covert CIA operations are a bigger bang for the buck than overt military operations.
174,"Ironically enough regeneron only is effective in treating mild to moderate covid, severe patients still only have thoughts and prayers to rely on"
175,Someone people like laying on carpets okay.
176,/s
177,Same here with the California Highway Patrol.
178,Everyone who isn't vaxed has to wear a mask in doors and will have to take a covid test once a week.
179,"For medical staff this isn’t, and should not be, about accountability."
180,This should wholely be about likelihood of survival.
181,"Those that end up in the hospital with Covid are more likely to die, even more so if they’re not vaccinated, and even with great medical care."
182,If the hospital is running out of resources it’s better not to use them on someone that is likely to die anyway.
183,"This is *not* a reprisal or punishment for the unvaccinated, it is simply applying regular emergency triage."

192,That's just normal triage right?
193,Focus on those that have a better chance of survival.
194,In the hospital.
195,This is in a public library
196,I thought it was all based on the Israeli study?
197,I agree with this.
198,"It's actually really refreshing to see this because I always feel crazy, but even without masks, I think the increase in cases would be negligible if not completely non-existent."
199,"Community immunity is much more widespread than we're giving it credit for, and I think we can still expect to peak in cases in 7-10 days, based on a lot of the modeling that's coming out."
200,"Careful there, you know 100% of folks who get the 5G VACCINE actually DIE?"
201,"Usually at the ripe old age of 100 from natural causes surrounded by their loved ones and great grandkids after having lived a hopefully good and full life, probably reminiscing about how this was only possible cause they got vaccines and listened to proper medical advice."
202,So people won’t get a vaccine for antibodies but they’ll collapse in the waiting room to get antibody treatment?!
203,Should anyone even have sympathy anymore?
204,Hard to
205,At least one guy had to wait over a week for surgery after being shot six times.
206,You’re missing the point.
207,Most vaccinated people who get covid don’t have severe symptoms.
208,Fauci said that specifically.
209,Your whole point is that if people are so sick that they’re extremely symptomatic then of course they have high viral load regardless of whether they were vaccinated.
210,**That argument isn’t correct and the data is showing most vaccinated people who test positive don’t have symptoms or have mild symptoms.

213,how convenient..  can we please see the amount of holdings our various governors have in this company

220,Polio vaccinations were distrusted before the CIA made it worse.
221,Peope who're afraid of the polio vaccine are not much different from people who're afraid of the Covid vaccine.
222,THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT THE SUFFERING OF ANYONE BUT THEMSELVES
223,Until this recall election...
224,The chad move would be to do the vaccine mandate now and then get elected and flip the bird to the anti-vaxx crowd in his victory speech.
225,"It seems the writing has been on the wall for herd immunity for a long time, journalism is just catching up with epidemiology."
226,"The virus will continue to circulate, but its impact will decline as repeat exposure (or repeat vaccination) builds our immune responses."
227,Absolutely.
228,One of the NYPD unions openly threatened DeBlasio and doxxed his daughter with zero care or consequence.
229,The city has no real power over them and both sides know it.
230,"Yea, maybe that's why the rest of these jackasses need to?"
231,"Definitely a question for your doctor, and I would suggest you call them tomorrow."
232,"That said, I’ve read a number of horror stories on r/nursing and elsewhere about unvaxxed pregnant mothers, and exactly zero about vaxxed pregnant mothers."
233,"If I were pregnant, I’d be getting vaxxed ASAP, even if recovered from an earlier variant."
234,"Especially considering the latest studies showing that naturally-acquired immunity via prior infection is not as good against Delta as it was against other variants, and pregnancy is known both to be immune compromising and an increased risk for severe disease."
235,You don't need restrictions to have your economy dip anyway.
236,I preface this by saying this is the right move.
237,"But at this point, does it even matter?"
238,"The non-masked days have already done its work and spread it to all their families, who have already overloaded the hospitals."
239,"Genie is already out of the bottle, it's just seeing how bad it gets."
240,It’s possible that some time in the future we may need to consider the idea of possibly getting booster shots.
241,Thanks.
242,I was really scratching my head on how they knew this.
243,"In the original thread his wife said he's relatively okay, but he's immunocompromised in some way and that's why he sought the treatment."
244,This is bad analysis.
245,"She’s assuming cases reach 7k a day, but it looks like things have already peaked (thankfully)."
246,They literally don't care.
247,Their number one objective is preventing any prevention?
248,I just don't get it.

250,I wouldn't want someone I live with to go out and eat indoors either.
251,Vaccinated or not.
252,"Especially if I was older, which I assume your mother is."
253,"it's not the same for every hospital, state, or country"
254,Or just until we can vaccinate the children.
255,Relax.
256,So considering 90% of the population has had the jab but half of your workplace hasn’t.
257,So therefore your workplace has an unusually high amount of people that are not vaccinated.

261,28 days later .... *announces* 3rd shot needed

264,No.
265,Just expectations at all really.
266,This is a novel virus and the implications of it are all just emerging.
267,It is going to take a very long time to parse through the repercussions of everything.
268,"That means biologically, emotionally, socially, economically, etc."
269,With so many unknowns it is helpful to change expectations to not necessarily good (positive) or bad (negative) and just try to have a wait and see attitude.
270,"We can mitigate, we can weigh risk/benefit/cost but ultimately there's not much we can do."
271,"So realizing this, and knowing much is out of our control, but the way we react to these things is within our control is helpful."
272,"Science is dynamic, constantly changing."
273,This is going to become endemic.
274,We need to listen to what experts and our doctors are telling us and go from there.
275,The ripples of this pandemic are going to effect a lot of things for many years to come.
276,It's important to calm down and not lose perspective.
277,"It's going to be like this for probably 5-10 years, but it's going to get gradually better."
278,"I'm fully vaccinated, I wear a mask, I social distance."
279,My son is 13 and fully vaccinated and is in person school since last fall.
280,My husband is an ER physician that has come into contact with and intubated CV19 patients every day for going on 2 years.
281,"He's never gotten sick from this, or if he has it was completely asymptomatic."
282,"He's not been subjected to weekly tests and has only taken one test when he was sick with something else, that was negative."
283,I am a nurse in the PICU and NICU.
284,I haven't gotten sick from work around positive patients or in the community either.
285,"It's a tough balance, but we do everything we can to minimize our risk while maintaining some perspective and we still live our lives without being hermits or catastrophizing every little thing."
286,"Media, social or otherwise is one of the worst things people with real fear and severe anxiety from this can consume."
287,"We live in a time that our media is polarized, click-baity, and maximized as such to generate clicks/money."
288,This is how the algorithms are designed.
289,"Staying informed and educated is good, but it's important to step back and unplug."
290,"Instead of doing this, people should talk to their personal physicians and even consider a therapist if needed."
291,This is all going to be okay.

329,A lot of us here in the U.S. got J &amp; J at a point in time when vaccines were scarce and the government was investing a lot in public relations saying that everyone should get whatever vaccine was available in order to increase the speed of the rollout for the benefit of the whole country.
330,And that was probably the right call at that point in time.

1."
354,"The vaccine reduces the number of breakthroughs, thus making them less likely to spread the disease."
355,2.
356,"The vaccine helps people with breakthroughs clear their infection faster, so they are contagious for less time, thus making them less likely to spread the disease."
357,I don’t think it’s entitlement as much as we are no longer required to in most situations…
358,Ask your doctor.
359,"I would say to get vaccinated,  but ask your doctor who knows you and ask their advice on what to do if you get a fever or have any other reactions."
360,So you can *confirm* from first hand knowledge there was no mention of covid on the death certificate and the death was not counted as a covid death on the trackers?
361,I saw that report and I wanted to shake that woman.
362,"I thought for sure that she was going to say yes, I’m getting the vaccine as soon as I can."
363,"But nope - isolated and having to talk to a reporter through a wall, and still unsure."
364,I can’t with these people.
365,"Last I heard, people will be due 8 months after second shot."
366,"So if it opens up a couple months before someone is 8 months past their second vax, they’ll have to wait."

371,Btw I am vaccinated but still…
372,What a surprise
373,No.
374,There’s not enough trained staff to fully man the actual hospitals.
375,"Our current bottleneck isn’t space, it’s staffing."
376,"There would need to be a National Guard or FEMA deployment, I’d guess."
377,But by that argument you place the blame on the CDC for the public's inability to reasonably handle being informed.
378,"I, for one, appreciate learning that there are other illnesses out there where 2 primers plus a booster work incredibly well."
379,I didn't know that before this article.
380,I'm glad I do now.
381,"That doesn't mean I'm going to burn the CDC to the ground if it turns out COVID isn't like that, because she made it clear they don't know."
382,"I'd rather be informed about all possibilities rather than be intentionally left in the dark for ""PR""."
383,"If the media cherry-picks the statement, I stand by my stance that the media, not the CDC, is guilty."
384,"The fact that most of the developing world will remain indefinitely unvaccinated will ensure that we will never leave this COVID conundrum, and there will always be a new variant to deal with."
385,But that is the reality of modern politics.
386,But I guess the big cities have extra people that can be sacrificed
387,"yes it is the short term benefit of an in person school year versus the long term consequences of tens if not hundreds of thousands of kids getting long covid, which we have no idea how long it lasts"
388,I really don't understand how people don't think masks don't work.
389,It's like why bother then to cover our mouth when we sneeze.
390,"My friend had a runny nose and congestion, etc a couple days ago and went to get tested."
391,He tested negative.
392,Today he told me he lost his sense of taste and smell.
393,I suggested he get tested again but how likely is it COVID at this point?
394,i dont think the issue is the risk now so much as the risk over a school year/semester.
395,unless we're going to do this by month or smth (frustrating just about everyone) we need to pick a plan and stick to it.
396,"in person schooling is too dangerous until 90%+ of the people in a school are vaccinated, and that includes children."
397,we can't rely on current case rate as politicians in this country have shown that they don't give a shit and will let another wave happen in 2 months at most

468,Tbh this is exactly why it *should* be appointed.
469,We don’t need the best scientist at the helm of the CDC…we need someone with a scientific background who actually knows how to handle public messaging.
470,"The CDC has been an absolute disaster since the start of the pandemic, and now continues their streak of incompetence into a new administration."
471,"In all honesty, the US should have gone on a week lockdown when Delta cases first started to be reported."
472,But there is no way US politicians would call for that.

477,The concept of herd immunity and the 70% was something that came out of the early studies and projections.
478,It made sense before the variants.
479,We are aiming to something slightly different now.
480,Herd protection instead of immunity.
481,"We can still get infected and infect others while vaccinated, but with vaccines we are more protected against severe forms of the disease."
482,"Vaccines won't make us immortals, only more protected."
483,"Unless these kids are being put in private schools, which seem to have few restrictions, homeschooling still might overwhelming for most families."
484,It sounds like even if they get a third shot you still want everyone around them to wear masks forever.
485,"Which is fine, you can have that view, just don’t expect the real world to actually work that way."
486,[removed]
487,&gt; But mostly I think supply is a solveable problem.
488,It’s not booster or third world.
489,We can do both.
490,"From everything I've read, I have not seen anything that indicates the manufacturing plants or staffing could be scaled up any time soon?"
491,"If you are proposing that only new, previously-unplanned manufacturing capacity should be used for boosters, instead of using manufacturing capacity that would otherwise be used for first doses, etc., I would support you in that."
492,"Nature has said that it may take 2 years from this summer to finish vaccinations - and if boosters use manufacturing capacity that would otherwise have been used for first/second doses, I guess it could be even longer?"

494,"Well, if they made a bad decision then (and many other times) then I have no confidence that any decision they make now and in the future will be good 🤷🏼‍♂️"
495,Isn’t that something thats generally supposed to be done prior to releasing it to the public?
496,Or are we supposed to just blindly take it and hope no issues arise?
497,"Also a shot that uses Dead virus particles like the flu shot to force your body to have an immune response is much different than a shot that makes your own bodies RNA replicate copies of the spike protein to create the immune response, that has never been used on humans prior; don’t ya think?"
498,"They also take precautions- but as you may know, masks really protect others from you more than the wearer from others."
499,"They've both been vaccinated, but their bodies don't mount a strong defense because of the drugs they have to take."
500,I'm hoping they get the third shot soon.
501,"I've heard conflicting reports on mortality rates for their specific situations, but both of them are over 60 and have some extra weight."
502,"Even social distancing and indoor capacity limits might need to be brought back, can’t be too safe."
503,"No, I think they made a bad decision."
504,I think people not getting vaccinated in high enough numbers is one problem.
505,I also think waning immunity to vaccines is another (but smaller) problem.
506,And I think ignorance in people who refuse to wear masks is yet another.
507,We’ll kill ourselves.
508,"We don’t need an agency around to instruct us, because we humans appear to be pretty darn stupid anyway."
509,Can’t blame the cdc for that.

514,That’s all it is.
515,"If there’s been a peak, it’s in Florida, where they’re ~53% vaxxed."
516,Alabama is ~35% vaxxed.
517,There has to be a consensus on what is a breakthrough case.
518,This study seems to include anyone who is vaccinated and tests positive as a breakthrough case while the CDC only counts those who are hospitalized or have died.
519,Well that's what I'm currently going through so hopefully that's the case.
520,I feel totally fine but I definitely don't feel like doing ANOTHER 10 day quarantine after this one is over.

671,The problem is people get vaxxed and think they don't have to do anything else.
672,The problem is also people who don't get vaxxed.
673,Vaxx + mask + distance + STFH.
674,Here’s a table [from Laurie Garrett](https://twitter.com/laurie_garrett/status/1428112312184021005?s=21) showing the % of each variant in the states.

681,Credibility is not a top priority for the CDC …… apparently.
682,Hmmm... any speculations on why it is more prevalent in males under 30?
683,"I’ve never been to Disney, but u have to admit, I’d have maybe considered going when they first opened back up, it seemed to be far less crowded at the time."
684,"But then again, I didn’t see a huge amount of footage of it opening back up from lockdown"
685,For real though.
686,I couldn’t wait to be protected
687,I see you ape
688,Right?
689,My thoughts as well.
690,I'm not sure what some of the other comments are freaking out about.
691,Wow you must not have kids
692,Honesty is the best policy.
693,&gt;*7.
694,* That’s how many breakthrough cases there have been in Congress.
695,When/Where did you catch that?
696,I missed it.
697,"One local article, a District had a hundred teachers that just quit , and that is on top of the 27 openings that they already had so they're scrambling big time and it's nothing but a mess only to be getting worse."
698,You'd have to prove that there *is* an issue with a third shot.
699,How many flu shots have you gotten in your life?
700,And the US is giving 3rd doses before donating the excess.
701,"That is some scary stuff when, as the numbers go up, another virus kicks in."
702,Started?
703,Does anybody really think Danny Boy’s grandchildren are going to public school?
704,"Nay my friends, they go to private school where masks are required."
705,The Texas felon is chock full of shit.
706,Hell even within a single county it’s a hodge podge.
707,"In my area we have neighboring districts that run the gamut from full mitigation measures like masking, distancing, eating in the classrooms, etc."
708,to districts that are literally doing nothing other than reporting cases and isolating close contacts because it’s required by law.
709,It hasn't been about science for a long time.
710,The countries which are and aren't banned are a total crapshoot.
711,Not to mention its all pointless since Americans can travel to those countries and then come back.
712,"I know, it's totally ridiculous."
713,"Wtf does a pandemic have to do with the application of laws, codes and legislation?"
714,"Also, what are magnets?"
715,"Great example of divisive, politically motivated rhetoric filled with twisted facts and blame."
716,These ideological media outlets are destroying our country and the world.
717,People like Patrick are just pawns in the game.
718,It's important to note that school has only just now started back up in Colorado.
719,"This trend is worrying, for me, because the school-bourne cases will start ticking up in a few weeks."
720,Thank you for your kind words.
721,Thankfully I don't live in the south.
722,"I live in KY and I am so so thankful we have Andy, who is trying his best to keep everyone safe."
723,Schools went back in my area 2 days ago and I told my husband we won't be taking our child out at all now.
724,Germany has the same vaccine and testing requirements.
725,"I also don't think it has made much of a difference considering Spain doesn't have it, but has similar uptake."
726,I think putting Portugal's high uptake down to things like that demeans the amazing reflection it gives on the country's society in one that has high trust in the health system and willing to get vaccinated for each other.
727,Why do these articles not tell you actual numbers.
728,I agree.
729,Considered myself little “r” republican my whole life.

738,If you have shortness of breath go to the ER or urgent care.
739,"That is what the CDC says[if you are sick with coronavirus ](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html)

&gt;When to seek emergency medical attention

&gt;Look for emergency warning signs* for COVID-19."

&gt;Trouble breathing

&gt;New confusion

&gt;Inability to wake or stay awake

&gt;Pale, gray, or blue-colored skin, lips, or nail beds, depending on skin tone

&gt;*This list is not all possible symptoms."
741,Please call your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you.
742,&gt;Call 911 or call ahead to your local emergency facility: Notify the operator that you are seeking care for someone who has or may have COVID-19.

746,The take up for younger people is way worse than for older people.
747,Obviously they have not had as long to get it - but it has been available to everyone for a while now.
748,[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-55274833](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-55274833) has a graph a 1/3 of the way down that shows take up by age group.

750,Just over 75% of adults fully vaccinated.
751,About 87% partially vaccinated.
752,"The messaging is important to motivate people, but to be clear, critical care is still provided in the ER."
753,We have routinely boarded ICU patients for minutes to hours while the ICU optimizes their bed plan long before COVID.
754,"I’ll throw in, increased nursing home deaths due to isolation."
755,I read a statistic about the likelihood &amp; scope of this and it was equally shocking and sad.
756,"I was grateful to see the measures my mom’s nursing home took to suppress covid infections &amp; deaths during the first months of the pandemic, but there was also a cost."
757,"My mom didn’t die from isolation, but her brain was clearly harmed (she lost a significant portion of her ability to communicate) &amp; she’ll never be the same."
758,"[Insouciance](https://www.etymonline.com/word/insouciance) is a decent word for it, but maybe we need a new word for this shit."
759,It's whole new depths of willful ignorance and pointless shittiness to look cool for your political tribe.
760,&gt;Reciprocity should be a basic rule of these things.
761,In an ideal world it shouldn't be.
762,Logically if country A has very high rates of Covid and country B has very low rates of Covid it would make sense for country B to close their borders to travellers from country A but not for the reverse to happen.
763,"Reciprocity makes sense for things like visas, not public health related travel restrictions."
764,Because my OG comment was about about how I preferred to pick India within the game *Plague* as my starting country.
765,"I wasn't talking about India irl at all, so actual pandemic history doesn't apply to the comment."
766,I wasn't even talking about Bubonic plague.

768,"I think we need to accept that when this becomes endemic, that this is going to be treated just like the cold and flu."
769,"People don’t isolate when they get mild illness, and if the vaccine makes this thing mild then I fail to see how it is different."
770,A lot of people are not going to upend their lives for a week or two because they have a cough and aches.
771,[deleted]
772,This is \[to my knowledge anyway\] the largest Canadian employer to date requiring vaccination before returning to work.
773,"When we start getting into the ""too big to fail"" companies within the country, it's a clear sign that it's just a matter of time before all companies put such a policy into practice."

792,At this point it's unvaccinated dying mostly which means most deaths are Republicans.
793,not mortal but you might lose 7-10 IQ points.
794,Everyone talks mortality but not morbidity
795,"So the unvaccinated are now creating an additional problem that while obvious in hindsight, I wouldn't have considered previously."
796,"The surge in hospitalizations is being driven almost exclusively by that group, pushing already overworked healthcare workers even further."
797,But with the added twist of having to treat people that openly refused a free and easy preventative measure.
798,"I think we're only weeks, if not days, away from a news article about a nurse or floor staff of a hospital taking a stand against having to treat people that should have never needed a bed in the first place."
799,Absolutely this.
800,"At least the stadiums are outside, most of the damage is done elsewhere."

809,It makes zero difference (in fact it’s even worse!!

811,I don’t think it’s a conspiracy I think it’s corruption.
812,In this case though I think it’s actually mostly political.
813,He wants to look like he holds the (southern) party line which is no mask mandates or vaccine passports.

824,"In Denmark they released mortality numbers for May, June and July 2021."
825,"Taking those months and comparing them to the average mortality rate of the same month 2015-2019:

May: 5.5% higher mortality rate

June: 6.8% higher mortality rate

July: 7.8% higher mortality rate

Shouldn't this be reflected in the numbers they show as well?"

843,*
844,The virus is inherently political because the Republicans refused to just shut up and accept certain measures for the good of society.
845,62% of the *total* population.
846,This headline uses the groups *adults*.
847,"It's tough to get away from that when we have a two party system and one party always seems to be doing everything in their power to ignore, down-play, or sometimes even spread the virus."
848,I'm sure if a Democrat politician in DC came out and agreed with Patrick on this topic they would be skewered just as much.
849,We'd have to do the same thing even if we had much high vaccine coverage.
850,"We have an elimination strategy and that has to be maintained at least until we can vaccinate all kids, which won't happen for months."
851,Even if we'd totally completed the adult rollout we'd have only 65-70% population coverage and that's nowhere close to herd immunity for Delta.
852,So we'd be locking down regardless.
853,"Look at China, which does have very high vaccine coverage but still immediately went to lockdowns when Delta appeared."
854,I'm also not too worried about containing it.
855,Our lockdowns are very tight.
856,Basically everything is closed right now aside from supermarkets and pharmacies.
857,"We don't even allow takeaways, and have a very short list of essential workers."
858,The outbreak will burn its way through a lot of households but won't spread much beyond that.
859,Numbers will drop off sharply after a couple weeks.
860,I'd like to finish reading the article but there's a pic of someone with a needle in his arm.
861,Urg.
862,"I confess, I avoid shots as much as possible."
863,They were very painful as a child and they are still painful.
864,The injected fluid burns in addition to the piercing pain.
865,I went 12 years without a tetanus shot and never have gotten a flu shot.
866,"*(I have no contact with the immunocompromised)*

For everyone saying that it didn't hurt, I'm glad for you!"
867,Everyone experiences pain differently similar to taste: different densities of nerves and pain receptors mean some people feel more sensation and/or perceives the sensation more painfully.
868,Breaking the skin with either a pierce or a slice makes me squirm.
869,"I can't watch it, I can't see it, even in an image."
870,I *hate* all of the stock footage of injections splashed all over publications these days.
871,Just thinking about a shot makes my knees weak.
872,I remember crying as a tot with every trip to the clinic; it didn't matter why we went.
873,I went and got the J&amp;J as soon as I was eligible and it was available.
874,"Yeah, it hurt, both the pinch and the injection."
875,"But I didn't wait on it and if a booster ends up being advised and transmissions are still a problem local to me, I will go get it despite how the very idea of shots makes me feel, how I know it will hurt to some degree, and the 3 days flat from the side effects."
876,I get trembly-nervous before a blood draw and weak kneed after but I actually prefer a draw to an injection.
877,But I'll still booster for COVID.
878,The TX republican party know this and have added a new plank to their party platform since their margins are thinning - cancelling direct statewide elections for the statewide executive positions and replacing with state senate district electoral colleges.
879,So basically republicans being more spread out will win more districts and thus keep a hold on power for far longer if they enacted this method.

939,"Israel, and probably most people, think 40% against symptomatic and 75-90% against hospitalization doesn't count as ""good"" or ""robust"" protection that's sufficient, but the CDC thinks it does, so wants the numbers to drop even more first."
940,"If I had to guess why, I think they're trying to make an ethical compromise, delaying how often people in the US get vaccinated to get more vaccines to poor countries."
941,"But I disagree with how low they're willing to let the numbers drop and me and my family will be following the recommendations from Israel, boosters for 40+ now."
942,And also the obvious need for everyone at 6months.
943,"With how many doses we're throwing out, I'm not worried about the ethics of line jumping."
944,I recently went to Europe and its amazing how much better they are handling this pandemic than the US.
945,"They have stricter rules including a ""health pass"" and everyone actually seems to comply with these rules."
946,"I'm sure some people here will be mad about international travel being open, but I honestly felt so much safer traveling abroad than I do here in the US."
947,I actually felt like I could trust that the person sitting next to me in a restraunt was doing the right things whereas here in the US a certain percentage of the population openly flaunts their indifference to the suffering of others.
948,Driving through rural Pennsylvania on my way to Canada recently people looked at me like I had two heads when I went around wearing a mask.
949,Saying the racist bit out loud… at least they’re not trying to pretend anymore
950,Look at you bring all these facts to a feelings fight.
951,"You must be pretty mediocre at governance if you need people to ""rat out"" municipalities to find out what is going on."
952,Isn’t hospitalizations and death a lagging stat?
953,Shouldn’t that come after decline of infections?
954,recording to my fyp its more white folk then anybody else
955,They don’t know what’s in the vax but do shit like this.
956,Make it make sense.
957,"I admit it is, was just the first time I seen AY.3 mentioned in that it was becoming more prevalent over Delta but even there it's admitted it could of been because of cluster testing and that over time we'd have to see."
958,Thanks for the updated data though!
959,You know how you can get the common cold again and again?
960,Similar principle at work here.
961,I’m losing track.
962,"Lambda is supposed to spread less easily, isn’t it?"
963,Is it as serious as Delta if you do contract it?
964,Does it affect vaccinated people the way Delta does?
965,You also get antibodies from only having one dose or from just catching covid.
966,"One guy at my team (26 I think) is a bit of an anti vaxer pro-covid, not the stereotypical American type, but more 'natural is better' type."
967,"I think this is the type of anti vaxer we have, they won't tell you not to get vaccinated or protest, but it's hard to convince them to take it."
968,"He's been arguing that it is not fair in Europe where non-vaccinated are not allowed to go gym, supermarket, clubs etc."
969,It's pretty obvious that he's not vaccinated.
970,"The whole team is vaccinated but him, even our Trump supporting American boss is vaccinated."
971,"Especially since the elderly are still most at risk, and something like 95%+ of them are vaccinated in the UK."
972,By Easter.
973,"&gt; I guess you are right, but EU tourism to the US is larger and Europeans leave much more money in the US than the other way around (as Europeans stay 3-4 weeks as Americans generally just a few days)."
974,"For the EU in general, sure."
975,But some EU states are much more reliant on tourism than others.
976,"A country like Germany probably doesn't care that much whether US tourists are coming or not, but the countries around the Mediterranean are much more affected by reduced tourism."
977,&gt; Still at this point I think reciprocity is the only language the US administration would understand.
978,"Block the border for Americans, and they will rethink their policy."
979,I hope that the EU will consider this now that summer holidays are coming to an end.
980,The current US policy is absurd.

1052,We have good vaccines even with waning immunity because they are still so effective against severe cases.

1054,And those are mostly from Pfizer I think.

1057,"What you said is incorrect: the likelihood of mutations causing global issues is quite high, and we're in the middle of such a situation right now."
1058,"And so my original question to you still isn't answered: if you don't consider the delta variant to be an ""excape"" variant, where are you setting your boundaries?"

1319,"Are there any good data sources on hospitalization rates grouped by age, gender, vaccination status, etc?"
1320,This might be an impossible question though since people that are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms are unlikely to be reported on.

1338,&gt;It's basically the same situation as to whether or not smokers should be admitted for cancer treatments or lung transplants.
1339,It's not even remotely close to the same scenario.
1340,I was just reading another article where it was saying delta will probably burn out in the next 3 months
1341,My under 12 kid is back in school.
1342,They made us decide distance or in person in May when things were looking better and they still had protections in place and a system for going part time or distanced as needed.
1343,"Now, no required masks, we have a huge amount of spread and the kids are just crammed in there with each other."
1344,Full bait and switch.

1359,Arguing in bad faith with terrible logic in a standard for those folks..
1360,"You deserve all the help you can get, and no one will blame you when you are at capacity and start turning away the unvaccinated who voluntarily made the choice to bring this on themselves."
1361,I have a question &amp; im not trying to be rude but do people (specifically adults) actually find shots “painful” or is it just a phobia thing?
1362,"I mean, obviously the prick you feel doesn’t feel good but neither does stubbing your toe &amp; the pain you feel from that last A LOT longer."
1363,"We don't need vaccine mandates and masks, since those reduce but don't stop spread, you'll never be able to have a society regardless of use of these vaccines."
1364,What we need is rapid testing so people can know if they have the disease and are contagious and can stay home.
1365,Two people walk into a bar.
1366,"One is unvaccinated, had Covid 8 months ago and recovered fully, doesn't have Covid now."
1367,The other is vaccinated but has an active Covid infection with mild symptoms.
1368,Who is more of a danger to society?
1369,I feel like 100% of the population SHOULD know the correct answer to this but I would guess that many don't.
1370,"Well, Lin Wood is telling the deniers to not go to the hospital because Doctors are killing people there."
1371,As a guy married to an ICU doctor who discharged more covid patients via the basement than via the front door these past two week I’d welcome it if these people rode it out at home until completion.
1372,There should be guidance out soon on that.
1373,"The vaccines are basically the same thing - Moderna just put more in its doses, iirc."
1374,I'm repeating word for word what I was told.
1375,"My 11yo will not be an excused absent, after 7 unexcused CPS will be called, because even if he lives in the same room as my other son who has symptoms and a fever, he still is supposed to be in school, so they're just marking him down ""unexcused absent"" This is *word for word* what I was told."

1377,It also might be worth mentioning *he himself is vaccinated with Moderna* so it’s not like he thinks it’s a death trap
1378,I agree - but I bet it stings when they just built that 5 billion dollar campus
1379,Does anybody have the data on how many are breakthrough?
1380,I’m starting to suspect it’s a high percentage.
1381,I know 4 people with breakthrough infections already.
1382,"I was aware that things were getting bad, but listening to the press conference with Governor Kate Brown and others, especially regarding the request for a field hospital, really hit home."

1407,UK has something like 95% of the 18+ population with antibodies.
1408,"Even if we assume conservatively (and incorrectly) that NO ONE under 18 has antibodies of any kind, that would still mean about 75% of the population of the UK has antibodies."
1409,"Even if 85% was needed for herd immunity, shouldn't we at least see some impact of that?"

1414,"Depending on which study you look at, it can still be up to 80-90% effective at preventing ANY infection at all."
1415,It is still considered statistically unlikely to get Covid-19 if you are fully vaccinated.
1416,Thank you for sharing your story.
1417,It'll still work because the GOP will find a way to blame Democrats and their base will eat it up.

1432,Republican strategists aren't stupid.
1433,"They looked at the stats on who is dying and where, and decided that killing those Americans is beneficial to their interests."
1434,Pure evil.
1435,I should have only spoken for myself and absolutely everyone I know when I said we were hoping for more from the vaccine.
1436,The fact many vaxers are still living in fear is just such a shock.
1437,"As for the first part of your response, I think you likely know what I meant but will clarify: 
human scientific achievement isn’t doing enough to solve the problem of global warming."
1438,"I don’t think it’s reasonable to pretend that humans are suddenly going to change our behavior, if that’s what you were suggesting."

1445,You're forgetting about long COVID.
1446,"And by going vaccinated you are at least a order of magnitude less likely to require hospitalisation, and even more orders less for dying."
1447,So catching COVID becomes acceptable risk.
1448,"No matter what anyone did, corona was always getting into NZ and Aus eventually."
1449,Asymtomatic spreading is virtually impossible.
1450,You're not coughing.
1451,Not sneezing.
1452,Not doing bodily fluid spreading things.
1453,The reasons viruses make you symptomatic in the first place is because there's an evolutionary advantage for them to do so.
1454,A coughing/sneezing infected person will spread the virus.
1455,An asymptomatic person won't.

1460,States are reporting up to 20% of hospitalizations are breakthrough cases.
1461,The numbers that 98% of hospitalizations are from unvaccinated is because that metric is based on the total infected since January 2021.
1462,Of course it's a smaller percentage.
1463,The numbers you should be looking at are the breakthrough cases in the last 2 weeks or a month.
1464,To be clear I am vaccinated and think everyone should get vaccinated but the narrative needs to change now.
1465,Giving people misleading information is contributing to this variant spreading and its jeopardizing more people's lives.
1466,The vaccines were very effective against the initial covid strain but the delta variant is not that anymore..
1467,The vaccines are less effective at overall resistance and people deserve to know that.
1468,Not to mention anyone that contracts it is another chance for the virus to mutate.
1469,Delta is the baseline now meaning all new variants will be just as transmissable and potentially more so.
1470,Thread starts fresh every day.
1471,Why aren't people allowed to take antibody tests to prove they have effective immunity - regardless of whether it comes from a vaccine or surviving Covid?
1472,The science exists.
1473,"I'm so sorry, my condolences."
1474,"Delta has changed the game, and the word really needs to get out about the real possibility of breakthrough infections, especially for the elderly and compromised."

1483,3x the payload of Pfizer is noteworthy.

1491,"&gt; The Republican governor said the order was issued to protect recovering businesses from ""another round of shutdowns."""
1492,But requiring masks or vaccines is not *shutting down*.
1493,This order is just idiocy and it means that the places hit hardest have no way to try to get things under control.
1494,These things are genuinely difficult for a lot of people and you minimizing it like this doesn’t help in any way.
1495,That’s how long our public health planning in my jurisdiction for this goes
1496,Nobody said?
1497,"This sub was awash with studies, articles, statements and comments swearing up and down that Pfizer and Moderna would stop you from getting symptomatic infection 80-95% of the time."
1498,They did promise asymptomatic illness.
1499,But that was against alpha and now we're dealing with delta.
1500,It amazes me at all how America is shooting themselves in the foot when they thought it was a good idea to do away with remote learning and return to in class learning.
1501,Your mucosal immune system is somewhat separate from your internal immune system.
1502,"For some people there may not be much crosstalk between them, so while the shot boosts immunity in their internal immune system, the mucosal system lags."
1503,"So Delta, which seems to like to replicate in mucosal cells goes wild there, and then when it steps into the lungs it gets the smackdown."
1504,Prescient!
1505,"But we don’t have time to wait for the whole process of “talk about improving education, eventually get the attention of Congress (big if!"

Right now it sounds like vaccination still offers  sizable protection to *you* from getting infected (but still not perfect as we have seen from the beginning), but it has stopped being as effective at preventing you from spreading like the earlier trials showed."
1535,"To summarize: In spaces where you would be expected to be exposed to large groups of people with questionable vaccination status, you’re going to want to start masking again, for both your own protection, and protecting people around you."

1541,No.

1619,A lot of people are angry at the government but not exactly for reasons people on here might suspect (you can check the Sydney sub).
1620,A lot of people criticise this gov for not enforcing a stricter lockdown earlier when the index case (of this outbreak) was caught.
1621,Instead they did nothing for 9 days and let delta circulate in a largely unvaccinated population with no restrictions at the time.
1622,The result was obvious and now we're here.
1623,Should’ve have gotten the vaccine.
1624,Science is the best we got.
1625,But it isn’t doing enough for global warming and let’s be honest we were all hoping for more from the vaccines.

1640,"For Pfizer I thought it was 8 weeks:

[https://www.bbc.com/news/health-57929953](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-57929953)."
1641,Either way good to see such high immunity after the third dose.
1642,Where I am in Aus my GP says he expects everyone to get a third dose about 8 months after the second then yearly after that.
1643,Just his view.
1644,Japans Olympic medal
1645,"True, but that has been covered by a separate study where they collected samples from both vaccinated and unvaccinated people and cultured them to see if they would grow."
1646,In 88% of the unvaccinated cultures the virus was activated and grew.
1647,In 95% of the vaccinated samples the virus was activated and grew.
1648,They thus conculded vaccinated people with high viral loads were equally contagious to the unvaccinated.

1679,"100 absolutely is under the threshold where the health service can handle it, and doesn’t justify ongoing measures."
1680,I would recommend wearing a mask with the Delta variant.
1681,More studies show that Pfizer and Moderna do not protect against Delta nearly as well as they did against the original virus.
1682,Moderna did alright because of the massive dose and Sinovac is solid since it was tested during the Delta waves in South America.

1728,We've got natural immunity for days.
1729,And we're getting first shots in 400k people (not just adults obviously) each day.
1730,As for a rough winter?
1731,I'd be VERY surprised if we won't be vaccinating kids by then.
1732,Seems like there won't be anywhere for the virus to go by winter.
1733,And theyre all DIRTY DIRTY PEOPLE!

1735,That one person is likely at a higher risk of dying than the kids they are teaching.
1736,"So is another situation where they can change the dress code to enforce masks, but it is still in compliance with the state order because they'll just not reference it?"
1737,"I feel at this point when someone gets covid and goes to the hospital, they should ask if they're vaccinated."
1738,"If vaccinated, come in for treatment."

1744,"Myself and my husband are vaccinated, the kids are too young but we all wear masks and distance ourselves from others, going out as necessary and none of it will help us at the ER if we need to go because Wendy read a meme posted in a moms group saying vaccines are unsafe and masks are socialism and shared it among the rest of her poor repressed conservative social circle."
1745,The unvaccinated are a personal threat now.

1756,They're going to get funding in each year's budget regardless.
1757,The sheer willful ignorance of these people is appalling.
1758,What if it turned out only 10 percent of the population were leftys but they made up 40 percent of serial killers?
1759,I'm just saying...look into it
1760,Yes you can get Covid and the variants multiple times.
1761,You did it again….
1762,"An excerpt from your own copypasta:

 “Phase 3 results evaluating the third dose are expected shortly and will be submitted to the FDA, the EMA and other regulatory authorities worldwide."
1763,"In the U.S., Pfizer and BioNTech plan to seek licensure of the third dose via a supplemental Biologics License Application (BLA) in individuals 16 years of age and older, pending FDA approval of the primary BLA submitted in May 2021."
1764,A third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is not currently authorized for broad use in the U.S.
1765,"However, under the current amended Emergency Use Authorization, a third dose was authorized on August 12 for administration to individuals at least 12 years of age who have undergone solid organ transplantation, or who are diagnosed with conditions that are considered to have an equivalent level of immunocompromise."
1766,"This authorization is based on information from an independent report evaluating safety and effectiveness of a third dose in people who received solid organ transplants.”



Like you need to read before you post a bunch of links like they’re some type of definitive evidence of safety and  directing someone to take this."
1767,Even their own words state its not authorized except for the immunocompromised and yet again beyond emergency use.
1768,Yet here you are using these links like they’re guaranteed proof of safety.

1796,People keep saying this but it is not true.
1797,Vaccinated people are still less likely to be infected at all.
1798,And vaccinated people who get infected aren't contagious for as long.

1806,"I wouldn't say it is becoming useless by 6 months, it seems more like it isn't as efficient against delta variant as it was against other variants."
1807,"Also we are now testing for milder cases too, from what I understand Pfizer's phase 3 was focused on more severe symptoms and at the time of those studies we were not testing people for every minor system either."
1808,It is still doing a very good job at keeping people away from hospital.
1809,"To be honest, I never bought in to the idea of vaccines preventing the virus completely so that a vaccinated person couldn't spread the disease either."

1812,"I'm assuming most boosters we are talking about are the mrna based shots, which don't often get sent to the ""developing nations"" since they can't store them."

1916,I'm scared you guys
1917,"&gt;Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&amp;D, said: “We need additional approaches for individuals who are not adequately protected by COVID-19 vaccines."
1918,"We are very encouraged by these efficacy and safety data in high-risk people, showing our long-acting antibody combination has the potential to protect from symptomatic and severe disease, alongside vaccines."
1919,**We look forward to sharing further data from the AZD7442 Phase III clinical trial programme later this year.

So even though it's passed 3 stages of clinical testing and has been shown to be highly effective, I'm guessing it still won't be available for a very long time."

1932,Why is there absolutely no accountability from Republicans?
1933,Probably want to leave the building first.
1934,I think there should be payment required for people having tests because they don’t want to be vaccinated.
1935,This would be applicable where there is a choice of vaccination or weekly tests and nit when required for medical reasons like exposure.
1936,Those who can’t be vaccinated for medical reasons would be exempt from payment.
1937,"I am not sure how many vaccinated people wind up being hospitalized and of those actually hospitalized, wouldn’t a significant percentage be older and probably be insured through Medicare in the US and Medicare patients generally have no out of pocket expenses as most have a Medigap plan that covers the amount not covered by Medicare."

1975,I think most parents probably feel this way but I am stressed out past 9000 bc 2 of my youngest kids are going back to school and cannot be vaccinated and we are in Texas and we have Lord Farquad Abbot trying to spread covid for his climb to the presidency.

1991,With Delta we are going to have to accept that the vaccine helps immensely at keeping you out of the hospital but is not as good as first thought at keeping you from getting Covid.
1992,Vaccinated people are getting it and getting sick though.
1993,A fully vaxed friend of mine just died of Covid.
1994,Don't ignore the symptoms even if you are vaccinated.

2037,I saw it too.
2038,The disposable meltblown blue masks like these perform better than cloth.
2039,The filter media captures high 90% of real-world challenge particles in testing.
2040,These are preferred since the fibers are arranged in random configuration.
2041,&gt;Being on the pessimistic side is better.
2042,"Respectfully, I think being perpetually pessimistic has really big costs, too -- whether to mental health, increased hygiene theater, and overcautiousness (with the caveat that I hesitate to use that term, as what depends on ""overcautiousness"" depends on individuals' risk tolerances' and local conditions)."
2043,"Personally, I think there's lots of room for optimism."
2044,"Statistically, COVID is running low on folks to infect."
2045,We're already seeing some of the earliest hit states turning.
2046,"Individuals can take a vaccine that lowers their risks of getting infected and significantly lowers risks of hospitalizations/death

We don't entirely know what will happen."
2047,But folks ultimately need some hope the current waves aren't permanent
2048,Maybe that's my problem!
2049,"I get anxiety in the morning after I smoke if I do it too regularly, so I don't smoke very much at all."
2050,I usually stick to sativa because indica makes me soooo sleepy and hungry.
2051,I think I'd rather figure out my eating self control than continue to deal with this morning anxiety.
2052,Thanks friend!
2053,I never thought to look into a different strain.

2055,"I don't believe the RBD closes after opening, but again, let me get back to you."
2056,One thing that greatly helped with eliminating my weed-induced anxiety was staying away from sativa and sticking with indica.
2057,"Indica gives me a mellow body high, while sativa tends to give me an intense head high that always puts me in a bad mental spot."
2058,Hopefully indica strains can help you with this.

2061,"Masks, vaccines, and anxiety certainly bad but they are all wonderful alternatives to infection, disease, death"

2068,Some Europeans have family in the US that they haven't been able to visit since March 2020.
2069,Yes but they still used that data to extrapolate a future state.
2070,They were not measuring that future state.
2071,Edit: I may be wrong but I re-read the source material and It still seems to me that they are modeling based on past data.

2076,"In the UK, 94% of adults test positive for antibodies, and you're seeing what he predicts for the US - it's spreading, but with a lower rates of severe cases."
2077,"Maybe with time, more exposure to the virus, and boosters/better vaccines we reduce it further, but it's certain that this is an endemic disease that we're not eradicating endemic circulation - certainly not any time soon."
2078,"In April 2020, using the very limited data available then, I calculated that the mortality rate in healthy under 70s was around 3 in 10000."
2079,"By October the WHO revealed that a more comprehensive study had shown that on average 5 in 10000 people under 70 were dying, but this included everyone below that age."
2080,"The paper gave a range as well, based on the fact that different countries have different baselines of health."
2081,"Delta, while being more transmissible, doesn't seem to have altered those tiny numbers."
2082,At the moment in the UK the virus mortality is in line with Influenza right now.
2083,The CFR is slightly higher than a bad Influenza year IF the same average number of deaths occurred each day for a year.
2084,The IFR will be lower as 1) all the cases won't have been tested and reported and 2) it's unlikely this level will remain for a whole year imo.
2085,"It's entirely possibly that due to many being vaccinated, others having natural immunity and the young being largely unaffected that the UK may already be in the position of it only ever being an Influenza level illness since around March this year."
2086,"Interestingly, Sweden has only the occasional death and has had weeks without any reported deaths."
2087,"However, they didn't restrict the virus from spreading too much in the first place, because of a very mild set of guidelines in their country."
2088,"This was criticised and toward the end of 2020 they increased the restrictions slightly, but that wasn't for too long and for a while now they have been back to advising a metre between groups and hand washing, as far as I saw."
2089,If you are in the States I'd be very interested if you can find an official list of the total number of ICU beds your country has as I am having a lot of difficulty with that.
2090,Actually yes you can and we proved that.

2101,ECMO is a very neat device that you never want to need.

2123,"The problem imo isn't the covid patients who failed to get their vaccines not having access to these machines, having them all blocked up like this means that people who are vaccinated who need them for non-covid reasons are similarly left without."
2124,This is imo the biggest problem with antivaccers.
2125,"I couldn't give less of a shit about them all dying off, their choice to die if they want to, the problem is when they get sick they take resources away from people who arent twats."

2184,He was very sick.
2185,So depleted and slept for days.
2186,"However, it never moved into his lungs."
2187,His cough stayed at bay with mucinex and NyQuil.
2188,"He felt bad, sure."
2189,But he never needed the hospital and definitely was never so sick that he would ever have needed the ICU.
2190,The vaccine definitely worked.
2191,He was sicker than he’d ever been (he doesn’t get sick often).
2192,But now he’s almost back to 100% a little over a week later.
2193,I’d hate to think of how sick he could have been if he wasn’t vaccinated.
2194,Also I agree with your point so I hope I don’t come across as argumentative

2208,He won’t be locking things down for people who won’t follow lockdown orders anyway and are more likely to get to the polls because of it.
2209,It sucks for anyone in those communities that has some other reason besides covid to go to the hospital.

2231,&gt;Florida officials are threatening to withhold funds if school districts in two counties do not immediately do away with strict mask mandates as the state continues to battle through high hospitalization rates.
2232,"Florida, Texas, Alabama and Georgia healthcare systems are all suffering from acute demand for dwindling intensive care unit (ICU) beds to accommodate seriously ill coronavirus patients."
2233,"Latest federal government data shows that earlier this week, 1m doses of coronavirus vaccine were administered in the US in one day, the first time that threshold has been crossed since early July, when inoculation rates were falling."
2234,Don't know if today was an abnormality being as the 7 day average went down 3 days in a row prior to today.
2235,TBH I am going to hold on the booster when it's first available (I would be in the November bracket @ 8 months).
2236,Not being so sick I had to be hospitalized was my main goal and there is evidence the vaccines continue to perform at that metric in the under-65 crowd.
2237,That second shot was ROUGH and I want to see what happens to others on the third before I jump right in.
2238,It looks like we are currently experiencing what looks to be the normalization of vaccine mandates in Canada.
2239,Safety trumps privacy (whether I fully agree with this statement or not is something else but it's certainly the approach being taken).
2240,There are key factors when making a decision like this.
2241,"There are of course always privacy risks involved but these are weighted against the necessity, effectiveness, and proportionality."
2242,**Necessity:**  must be evidence-based and there must be no other less privacy-intrusive measures available and equally effective in achieving the specified purposes.
2243,"**Effectiveness:** must be likely to be effective at achieving each of their defined purposes

**Proportionality:**  the privacy risks associated must be proportionate to each of the public health purposes they are intended to address."
2244,"Data minimization needs to be applied so that the least amount of personal health information is collected, used or disclosed."
2245,"For example, under Ontario Occupational Health and Safety Act, employers have a duty to protect their workers from health and safety risks."
2246,There exists a similar duty for federally regulated employers subject to the Canada Labour Code.
2247,"Accordingly, in certain circumstances, an argument could eventually be made that, in the face of evidence demonstrating that the COVID-19 vaccination is an effective measure for reducing the risk of transmitting (as opposed to contracting) the virus, employers are within their rights to mandate immunization in order to protect all other employees in the workplace."
2248,"The erectile dysfunction part should be on every billboard, every commercial break, and all over Facebook ads."
2249,Umm when did we leave the pandemic-era?
2250,"A simple spike antibody test can also confirm, unless its been too long ago."
2251,How are your ears after a 12hour shift with all that tension?
2252,"I dunno, most of my anxiety comes from unvaccinated morons dragging this pandemic out longer than it needs to be."
2253,I think they will eventually charge a premium if not vaccinated just like smokers.
2254,If you wind up in the hospital due to Covid complications it’s very expensive and insurance won’t want to take the brunt of that cost when a free vaccine is readily available.
2255,It’s the kinda thing where you either have to smoke every day or not at all.
2256,Same thing with alcohol and hangovers.
2257,They shouldn't say preventable because you can still get it with the vaccine.
2258,That’s my position right now.
2259,We don’t know what to do.
2260,Yeah.
2261,Like what are all these people lying around in the ER?
2262,All Republican crises actors?
2263,It is going to get worse.
2264,Health insurance carriers are beginning to end the practice of waving deductibles and co-pays for COVID related medical bills.
2265,This could drive people to avoid treatment and long COVID is about become very costly in the US.

2268,Only a proper fit test can give you a real answer.
2269,"The fit test measures when you're talking, lifting, turning side to side and up and down, and making facial expressions."
2270,Not really sure how predictive a flame test would be if it's to check fit.

2303,The world is better off without you.
2304,According to Bloomberg Oregon has given enough vaccines to fully vaccinate 60% of their population.
2305,That’s really good as far as US states are concerned but that still leaves 40% unvaccinated and it also takes a few days for the vaccines to really kick in.
2306,Obviously some of the unvaccinated have already had covid and recovered but 40% is still a significant unvaccinated population and provides plenty if room for a variant to spread especially if the 40% aren’t taking other precautions.

2356,This isn’t something to be happy about.
2357,This is a gross symptom of our rotten and exploitative system.
2358,Exactly.
2359,"To quote [this](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/04/14/coronavirus-heart-lung-bypass/) April 2020:

*The latest figures show that 264 U.S. hospitals out of more than 6,000 in the country have the ability to perform ECMO."
2360,"Because of geographic distribution, only 58.5 percent of the adult population in the United States has access to an ECMO-capable center."
2361,"This number jumps above 90 percent when effective interhospital transfer is available, under ideal circumstances."
2362,"*

Only a small portion of the ones listed above will have the knowledge and capacity to do it for small children."
2363,It's certainly a remarkable treatment that can provide a chance of survival in some cases where there otherwise was none.
2364,"However, it's far from certain."
2365,I've been reading several comments lately on social media by people that were sure that their loved ones would have survived covid if they had received ECMO.
2366,"That may well have been the true in some of those cases, but the fatality rate for covid patients that have received ECMO is still close to 50% based on the ELSO registry."
2367,"In other words: One should definitely try to get ECMO if it is considered useful by the hospital, but you really don't want to be in that situation because that means it's extremely serious and the risk of death is very high."
2368,Posted earlier.
2369,At hospital now.
2370,Can’t breathe.
2371,There’s a lot of protocol involved to get tested before you can get admitted.

2423,I’d advise against arguing that on Reddit.
2424,People get very emotional about this stuff on this site and lack the eq to understand the medical ethics aspect of it.
2425,This regularly advocates for extrajudicial lynching of people who hurt animals (and make no mistake I have 0 sympathy for abusers).
2426,"Hell, half the time they want the justice system to treat it like regular murder."
2427,It’s just very hard to get across to people the true ethics and morality of some of this.
2428,"Medically, ethically, you can’t deprioritize someone’s treatment just because they chose not to get vaccinated."
2429,I understand emotionally most of us want them to get second rate treatment next to someone who is vaccinated or can’t get the vaccine.
2430,"Fuck, even I think that’s ‘just deserts’."
2431,"But from an ethics standpoint, that’s a giant hard no."
2432,Even explaining to people why it’s a no go will be met with people going “bUt tHeY cHoSe sO” (or “how come it’s okay for them to endanger others!!
2433,"!” Which is true, but it’s shifting the discussion away from the doctors duty)."
2434,People don’t think of the ramifications beyond the immediate future example.
2435,"I also hate to invoke a slippery slope argument, but ethically it’s a tight rope to walk."
2436,Plus people sometimes just make bad choices.
2437,Making a mistake or having a shitty opinion isn’t grounds for a doctor to sign your death warrant.
2438,"It sucks, doctors often wrestle with it and dislike it too."
2439,But thankfully most of them understand the ethics and their oath.
2440,"Fuck the unvaccinated, but ethically you still have a duty to treat them just as anyone else."
2441,"Medical care is a fundamental human right, and you can’t start segregating and not treating people just because you don’t like their choices or because they’re morons."
2442,As much as I on a basal/reactionary level agree with people saying unvaccinated people should deserve the fate of their own idiocy.
2443,It sucks to know that people doing everything right or that are unable to get vaccinated have to potentially suffer because a selfish entitled asshole didn’t want to get vaccinated.
2444,"And that is an incredibly, *incredibly* difficult thing to turn the other cheek towards and do the right thing on."
2445,Of course it’s also much more complicated than I make it out to be.
2446,Medical ethics (and ethics in general) is its own entire field of study.

2493,This shift will help maximize the quality of the data collected on cases of greatest clinical and public health importance.

2513,"Right, no fucking end to this."
2514,So good job on making personal choices like adults do.
2515,"Zero, government pays right now"
2516,Clickbait!
2517,"We’ll probably need booster jabs every 6 months or year, though."
2518,The vaccine does wear off in time
2519,This is the type of headline and shit article the anti-vaxxers will wrap their claws around and grip for dear life as *irrefutable proof* that the vaccines don’t work and *give you* COVID.
2520,Just like how all of them constructed giant multiparty indoor tent dining spaces outdoors to comply with local ordinances during winter

2522,The ones that protect against delta?
2523,Or just more for no reason?
2524,When’s the next round coming out?
2525,Can I get a combo pack?
2526,That is an *extremely* great ending.
2527,I love the future (compared to conversations from early last year).
2528,My family is fully vaccinated.
2529,"Only my mother is high risk, but it’s still a relief."
2530,I’m happy for you.
2531,Fur most places the amount of local transmission is so much higher than imported cases that even preventing 100% of cases is essentially meaningless.
2532,"Hawaii may be different given how much of a tourism hub it is, but it's still hard to imagine the benefit is substantial given the already very high level of community transmission."
2533,Pretty crazy to see that things typically \*don't\* spiral out of control in areas with high vaccination rates!!
2534,"/s

Sarcasm aside, at this point it's clear there's a striking correlation between vax rates and outbreak strength."
2535,"Relatively high-vax states have seen cases rise, but much more slowly."
2536,"Where they have leveled out, they have leveled out at lower levels."
2537,"The few exceptions (OR, WA, HI) have really low natural immunity (and in any event are seeing outbreaks better than the worst states)

Relatively low-vax states are getting hammered."
2538,"The exceptions here (e.g., the Dakota's) are off-season, albeit starting to see case spread

tl;dr: vaccines still work"
2539,I’m genuinely confused as to what this person thinks they should be doing differently?
2540,Sore throat = get tested.
2541,You may have been exposed just before or soon after that second shot…before the boost in protection has had a chance to kick in.
2542,Or you may simply have caught another respiratory virus that’s floating around.
2543,"Good luck, hopefully it’s just a cold and you’ll feel better soon!"
2544,Good news!!!
2545,"""However, even though cases will likely continue to rise in a concerning manner in the near future, their rate of increase is beginning to slow, said Prof. Eran Segal, a computational biologist at the Weizmann Institute and a member of the Health Ministry's advisory panel."
2546,"This has already begun to happen due to recent increases in the number of triple-vaccinated and recovered people, he said, cautiously predicting that the increase in cases could taper off in the first or second week of September, leading to a decline."
2547,"""This is not certain, and it’s only been a few days that we've been seeing this trend,” but “we may see a halt in the spread,” he said."
2548,"“There’s still no certainty, but that scenario looks like it’s starting to go in that direction."""
2549,But they won’t.
2550,Watch.
2551,With the amount of fucked up healthcare professionals out here saying crazy shit I don’t expect them to triage on vaxx status.
2552,It's not about patient responsibility it's about likelihood of recurring infections.
2553,An unvaccinated patient is entirely more likely to wind up in the same situation as a vaccinated or undervaccinated individual.
2554,I highly doubt the issue is even going to be the determining factor in many of the decisions anyways but it's irresponsible to use the resources on the one likely to come back or die rather than the other that's going to recover and stay away.
2555,"There’s PLENTY of people who got Covid, got over it, never went to the hospital during the whole thing."
2556,"How nice of you to be worried about stranger pain, but also you can keep your worries to yourself."
2557,"&gt; rational, reasonable Britons

First time anyone on reddit has called us that!"
2558,&gt;The venn diagram of people who don’t want to get vaccinated and don’t care about masks mandates is basically a single circle.
2559,Nope.
2560,Lots of entitled people who think the vaccine is a panacea are not wearing masks.
2561,"I think the difference is that in the scenarios you describe, those people are only hurting themselves."
2562,The antivaxers are endangering all of us.
2563,They are one of the main reasons we’re having the hospital shortages in the first place.
2564,"So yeah, maybe I’m cold hearted, but if there’s one hospital bed left, and it can go to either a vaxxed person or antivaxer (I’m not including those who cannot get vaccinated), then I definitely think the vaxxed person should get it."
2565,Totally normal
2566,"At this point the agenda is to get back to normal, people be damned."
2567,"Either you'll die or you won't, but damn it those fuckers want their BBQ."
2568,Compared to previous peaks this isn't high though.
2569,And considering we are back to normal it's a miracle.
2570,"No masks, night clubs open, no social distancing."

2572,"So I guess liver transplant is based on the sickest, no need to abstain from alcohol then."
2573,Drink it up!
2574,Honesty?
2575,Compared that to the those anti vax infected people in the hospital wishing they had taken the vaccine instead of being in agonizing pain and worrying if they are going to die.
2576,"You can dislike it all you want, but that is what happened and what is still happening."
2577,The governor of Florida threatened to cut school funding if schools instituted a mask mandate and then when he realized he couldn't get away with that he threatened the pay of any administrators instead.
2578,"Other countries are facing difficult ethical questions about re-opening, but about half of the US seems to just not care."
2579,This is big
2580,This may not sound right but we need to re-evaluate our ethics in this country.
2581,People need to start taking responsibility of their health and their decisions.
2582,There is too much of blaming on other and not actually face the consequences of your own decisions.
2583,You clearly haven’t read “Mask Facts” by esteemed epidemiologist Emery Leonard.
2584,Get well soon!
2585,The article is saying that the hospitals cannot staff the beds they already have.
2586,Why build more?
2587,"Presumably it can be useful, but if your body is producing antibodies at most it would reduce severity/duration if administered early enough I’d imagine."
2588,Oh it’s ok in states where everyone is vaxxed right??!
2589,Why are you worried if your vaxxed?
2590,"You won’t end up in the hospital, right?"
2591,You don’t have to be worried.
2592,So my job also requires this.
2593,But it’s on an honor system and they aren’t requiring proof of vaccination.
2594,Let’s just say that there are some dishonorable people I work with that I KNOW aren’t vaccinated….

2606,"Keep fighting the good fight, truly 💪👍!"
2607,~ some random Canadian lady choking back tears on the bus.
2608,Most mild cases are vaccinated people.
2609,I'd like to see a source for your claim.
2610,"And a definition of what they mean by ""mild""."
2611,"""Mild"" cases can, and still frequently do, have chronic outcomes."
2612,"I mean seems early to draw conclusions, they could have been infected at the time of administration, but if the elderly/immunocompromised can't be protected by 3 shots, then we're in for a pretty long road."

2626,If only there were a way to prevent this!
2627,"Something inexpensive, that didn't take a lot of time or effort."
2628,Some ... way...?
2629,That's just a re-statement of the same thing.
2630,"It just tells us ""un/vaccinated people with such serious health symptoms that at notice them in hospitals have similar levels of the virus."""
2631,"It doesn't contradict ""the vaccine will prevent lots of people from ever reaching that stage."""
2632,[removed]
2633,They still won't get it.
2634,They won't get it until it hurts them personally
2635,Both of them are factually correct but are answers to different questions.
2636,"If the question was about knowledge then the answer would be ""don't know""."
2637,"If the question is about stance, then they cannot answer ""we don't know"" because that just means they're not doing anything and just sucking their thumbs."
2638,They're doing things based on the assumption that no booster shot is needed but they acknowledge that they are not sure if that assumption is correct.
2639,"The problem is when the media took that answer and twisted it to answer the ""do you know"" question."
2640,Here's an example: a general told his men to set up a defense perimeter.
2641,"The reporter asked ""do you know what the enemy's going to do""."
2642,"He said ""we don't know""."
2643,"The reporter asks ""so why are you setting up a defensive perimeter""."
2644,"He replied ""they could attack so we are anticipating that""."
2645,"So the reporter tweeted ""enemy attack is coming, the army is readying defenses""."
2646,Did they go through LAX?
2647,My Uncle in Law travelled to LA to get vaxx'd because in mexico all they have are the russian and chinese vaccines which are not recognized in Canada.
2648,He got COVID right after he returned from his first dose.
2649,"Thankfully, even one dose seems to be helping, he feels terrible but has avoided the hospital."
2650,I heard a rumor from LA friends that LAX is basically a hot spot by itself...
2651,This is the way bruthaaaa
2652,Are there really people out there who still follow and trust what the CDC says?
2653,!
2654,"By Thanksgiving, we'll probably have kids' vaccines though."
2655,"If they do shut it down, I'd expect it to be earlier and then reopen after the new year, but that's a big IF."

2657,Anyway...
2658,The more you know
2659,[removed]
2660,Couldn’t you make the same argument in countries that have low vaccine rates?
2661,Why do you say that?
2662,[removed]
2663,"The phrase is, “I couldn’t care less”."
2664,"I’m sure you’re also regularly on tender hooks, and wouldn’t say boo to a ghost."
2665,100%.
2666,And without support from so many of the yahoos in our state.
2667,"We have a decent majority but a lot of pretty severe nonsense as well, and she deserves a lot of credit for working though the latter."
2668,"Damn, NY is nasty"
2669,"Let’s put that silly word in perspective here...

Silly to mock a racist character vs not mock a character clearly intended to inform rather than cause infighting...

I’d say the making fun of him is necessary, while the same being said of Maddow feels a bit like reaching for low hanging fruit to forgive excuse making-coward boy."
2670,"I digress, I think most of us could do with a good bit of *ranked choices* in which channels get the most support/air time, right now that *handful of billionaires* would rather have us at each other’s throats."
2671,This doesn’t happen though.
2672,Obese people and smokers have very long times before that becomes a problem for them; so they don’t overload hospitals unless there is some other event that is causing their comorbidity to express itself.
2673,That’s the difference here.
2674,"But yes, when they get to rationing care, obese people and smokers get deprioritized because they’re less likely to survive."
2675,That’s pry what’s happening here.
2676,"If you don’t have a vaccine your likelihood of dying from Covid is much higher, so it’s better for them to use those resources to treat someone else more likely to survive."
2677,[removed]
2678,The problem is we spent the last 18 months telling everyone to sit in there house and wait for serious symptoms instead of educating the public on early treatment options.
2679,"I could be wrong or heard this on TV or something, but if you need an organ transplant, unless you are wealthy and can just buy your way to the top of the list, if you cannot be responsible enough to take care of the donated organ then you can be denied the transplant, I think."
2680,"Like if you need a liver transplant but can't stop drinking permanently I think they can decide not to do the transplant, or at least prioritize people who need the liver for non alcohol related reasons or have at least shown an ability to stay sober for a long period of time."
2681,I see this situation with the vaccine as similar.
2682,Of course still treat the unvaccinated but if it comes down to the last bed in the ICU the vaccinated person should be prioritized for treatment since they were more responsible.
2683,"Trust in scientists who have been correct through this pandemic, and the government who leads the world as the least corrupt and most transparent in all indexes, makes me in denial?"
2684,You're uninformed.
2685,[removed]
2686,We really need nationwide trials after this is all over to hold people like this accountable.
2687,"Every moron local sheriff who refused to enforce mask mandates, every local politician who sabotaged efforts to contain the virus, every organization who deliberately spread misinformation for profit or political gain."
2688,They all failed us in a crisis.
2689,If we just let it go what will happen next time?
2690,How will we learn and avoid this in the future if we just let them pretend like they didn't fight against society on the side of the virus.
2691,That's an assumption and isn't helpful.
2692,Additionally every day that passes after the first dose provides you with a little bit more protection.
2693,"Even if someone does contract covid soon after vaccination, it just may end up a bit less severe."
2694,"Fair point, but quitting smoking is a hell of a lot harder than getting a vaccine."
2695,Also important to think about the percent of people vaccinated with this number.
2696,That’s still incredibly low all things considered
2697,This post appears to be about vaccines.

2734,A massive proportion of positive tests during those last few months before that were in school children (i.e.
2735,a totally unvaccinated community).

2764,I think it's not a foregone conclusion that school openings will cause another wave.
2765,"I get that young children haven't been vaccinated, but it's been proven that young children don't transmit COVID as well."
2766,I also don't think that it's likely for a prolonged wave to continue through the Fall given how much immunity people have from this current wave.
2767,"Lastly, I don't think schools will make much of a difference because of just how little social isolation is going on outside of schools."

2818,This data doesn't add up in terms of the real world numbers.
2819,"60% of Israelis are fully vaccinated, and yet their current spike is as trending as high as any previous spikes, pre vaccine."
2820,I just don't think the vaccine is very effective against Delta.
2821,This study is missing something.
2822,At a LIBRARY.
2823,With no prescription or referral?
2824,At a library.
2825,"Labor Day weekend Atlanta will host 40,000 people for Dragon Con and tens of thousands more for the Alabama vs Miami SEC game on the same weekend in the same hotels."

2827,The convention is at least requiring masks as well as vax or a negative test result but it still seems like a landmine.
2828,Your getting downvotes I think you need a /s
2829,Not really.
2830,Many states don’t even require ID to get vaccinated to encourage illegal immigrants to not fear vaccination.
2831,"Not all states have records, and the ones that do don’t have them for everyone."
2832,"There are many actually intelligent, well educated people using real science and technology to track ""new"" variants that may be variants of concern or interest."

2855,[removed]
2856,So I have a reason for believing this is a good idea other that punishing antivaxers.
2857,I believe getting the vaccine means you are more likely to have a better outcome because you are more likely to listen to your doctor and follow after care instructions.
2858,Those who disregard medical advice by refusing the vaccine are more likely to disregard other advice and not take medications prescribed or follow through with physical or respiratory therapy and follow up appointments.
2859,If care has to be rationed it should be to those who are going to follow medical advice.
2860,It’s important to factor in that those who were vaccinated are more likely to survive due to having at least some immunity.
2861,When care is rationed it has to go to those with the best chance of surviving.

2863,"Ya, I live in Fort Worth and I thought we had high prices and expensive homes rip."
2864,"Yeah this isn’t great at all, as much as i dislike antivaxxers i still hate to see needless death especially in these droves"
2865,"Delta burned through the UK population quickly, but it probably helped to have 80% of their population fully vaccinated."
2866,Less hospital resources need to be taken up that way.
2867,"In India there was a mad scramble of families trying to find oxygen tanks, even empty ones, to fill and supply to ill family members."
2868,People were sitting in cars with an oxygen tank next to the door and an oxygen hose running in through the window to a person sitting in the passenger seat or the back seat because that was the only treatment available.
2869,"There comes a point where deaths increase not necessarily due to the virus itself, but due to all conditions that require hospitalization yet have no beds open to offer timely and adequate treatment."
2870,It's the reason why reducing the curve was emphasized so strongly at the start of the pandemic.
2871,"At this point in the southern US the curve is approaching a vertical line and so many ICUs are out of beds or at least out of the staff needed to work more ICU beds, effectively keeping some out of service."
2872,"Even if all the Covid patients currently in the ICU recover fully and gain natural immunity, that doesn't help people in the meantime having heart attacks and strokes and getting injured who don't have a hospital nearby that can take them in."
2873,You can't just hit snooze on your heart attack and tell it not to happen until the hospitals have room.
2874,"Yes, this variant is going to give a lot more people exposure and antibodies due to its effectiveness in spreading, but that doesn't mean it won't come at a high cost."
2875,I will never get over the fumbling of the mask shit early on.
2876,Yea sure the data didn't say masks prevented transmission... BECAUSE THERE WAS NO DATA AT ALL.
2877,You telling me consistently messaging that masks are just generally a good precaution for any new respiratory virus is bad science?
2878,I really wonder how much politics came into play despite the CDC supposedly being independent-ish
2879,&gt; not everyone who is unvaccinated is an anti-vax conspiracy nut.
2880,"No, they're just Asimov's professed confident ignorants."
2881,"Their ignorance isn't just screwing the economy or preventing us from getting back to a more normal lofe, oh no, they're risking the lives and quality of life for hundreds of millions."

2887,That is the question the virus asks.

2925,The largest union supports the mandate and announced as much right after her announcement.
2926,"If it’s anything like nursing unions, the majority will either go with it or be silent."
2927,Delta isn't that vaccine resistant.
2928,"A British study found that Pfizer's vaccine was [88%](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2108891) effective against symptomatic disease from Delta, compared to 95% against wild-type."
2929,"In comparison, Pfizer's vaccine was [75%](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01222-5) effective against the Beta variant, so we know Beta is more vaccine resistant."
2930,"Moderna tested using a 3rd booster of their original vaccine, and a Beta-specific vaccine, and the results weren't too different: [https://investors.modernatx.com/static-files/c43de312-8273-4394-9a58-a7fc7d5ed098](https://investors.modernatx.com/static-files/c43de312-8273-4394-9a58-a7fc7d5ed098) (Slide 29, mRNA-1273.351 is Beta-specific vaccine)

So I would think that they decided that using the original vaccine was good enough, and that reworking the production line for variant-specific boosters and getting approval wasn't worth the benefit."

2959,Stories of overloaded ICU's mortuary trucks and people dying unnecessarily - not directly due to COVID but because say a stroke victim can't get the care they need because EMS and hospitals are past capacity - are cropping up.

3202,"If you have caught Delta and are exhibiting symptoms, the virus has replicated enough and damaged enough tissues to produce those symptoms."
3203,The point during an infection where this happens will have a similar amount of the virus present.
3204,The vaccine is for enabling your immune system to be prepared to respond to the infection quicker; that way you are able to rid the infection before it can overwhelm an unstimulated immune system and cause more life-threatening illness.
3205,Sometimes that means the immune system will respond before the virus can establish a foothold.
3206,And sometimes not; where the symptoms of the infection will appear similar at similar replication levels.
3207,"Not yet, although we’ve declared a soft Code Able (external disaster) and sent up flairs."
3208,"If the vaccinated shed as much as the unvaccinated then it does take away some of the reason lots of people got vaccinated, so they would not spread it."

3226,The vaccine is basic training to teach your immune system the tricks on how to defeat the virus.

3264,Elimination does not mean that there will never be cases.
3265,"For example, we say that measles has been eliminated in the US, but from time to time there is infection from abroad which results in an outbreak."
3266,But thanks to effective disease control measures those outbreaks are quickly suppressed.
3267,The situation with COVID-19 in China and New Zealand is exactly analogous.
3268,The only cases are those due to infection brought in from abroad which escape the border controls.
3269,"In China, robust quarantine measures mean that the recent outbreak originating from Nanjing airport has quickly been brought under control."
3270,"Yesterday, the number of new cases of COVID-19 in the community was four (4) across the entire country; three stemming from the Nanjing outbreak, one coming over the border from Myanmar."
3271,I fully expect that number to be back down to zero within the next few days.
3272,"As for animal reservoirs, yes they do exist, but neither China nor New Zealand has recorded even a single case of transmission from animal to human."
3273,"The only cases of animal-to-human transmission reported elsewhere have been from minks to humans, which is not exactly a high-risk route for many people."
3274,Breeders are now aware of this and can take appropriate precautions.
3275,"Even the Nature article that you cited states that ""More than one-third of the respondents to Nature’s survey thought that it would be possible to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 from some regions while it continued to circulate in others."
3276,"In zero-COVID regions there would be a continual risk of disease outbreaks, but they could be quenched quickly by herd immunity if most people had been vaccinated."""
3277,"That is pretty much the situation we have with polio and with measles, so why don't we pursue it for COVID too?"

3299,Most people in the hospital are vaccinated which will always be the case now unless hospitals divert patients based on covid status.
3300,You don't toss out the heart attack patient because you need the bed for a covid patient but you definitely start decreasing the admittance of new patients with a lesser mortality risk.
3301,I'm sure there are hospitals with greater than 50% right now but they are the outliers and that will unquestionably stay true in this wave no matter how bad it gets in...well...fuckwit territories.

3442,It's unfair to make employees enforce them against people who get belligerent about it.
3443,If I were a manager I'd enforce vaccinations for all my employees and not bother with masks for customers.

3465,"When you're first infected, your Ig A and IG M are the initial fast antibodies that start to protect you."
3466,In a few hours to a few days then your immune system spins up a more robust response with memory T and B cell immunity.
3467,The antibodies that wane over time and that delta is better at overcoming are the initial antibodies.
3468,The booster will get these up more so that the virus doesn't get totally out of control before our B/T cells get spun up.
3469,Sometimes when the virus gets a good foothold in our bodies before the T/B cells are mobilized that infection gets so out of hand that T/B cells don't work as well or at all.
3470,THIS is why we need boosters.
3471,Think of it as extra insurance to cover us before the real immune cells get there and take over.
3472,You can clear the virus faster if you have more of the initial antibodies.

3745,It blows my mind that schools have to inform parents of lice (this was definitely the case when I was in school) but they’re just now allowing parent notification of fucking COVID.
3746,You don't hear it because with how transmissive Delta is we would need 90% of the population to have the antibodies and a chunk of the population are under 16 so they aren't eligible so we can't hit 90% even if we wanted to.

4020,T Cells are the biggest part of any immunological response and they only last days before being filed away into memory cells.
4021,It is not ethical to lie about your vaccination status to get a third a vaccine whilst much of the world is yet to have one.
4022,I’m honestly happy they did because I almost doubted myself for a second.
4023,This is one of the weirdest fucking comments I’ve ever seen on here.

4058,Although they are lower than was expected when removing restrictions.
4059,Deaths have risen but they are far below the peak in winter of 1820 per day.
4060,The problem is that these are scientists used to talking to other scientists where “this might turn out to be total BS” is taken as given with basically any declarative statement.
4061,"When current medical advice needs to be updated, scientists are like “oooh interesting” but the public feels jerked around and gets mad and distrustful."
4062,"I agree it's not fair, but if our strategy is not to vaccinate poor countries, the vaccinated in other countries are going to need boosters."
4063,So far that doesn't seem to be the case?
4064,"AFAIK, it's only immunocompromised, and everyone else has to wait 8 months?"
4065,What if those people catch COVID while overseas?

The problem is that the fears about vaccination are being promulgated and exacerbated by people who are vaccinated and whose kids wear masks as mandated in their private schools."

4159,Nobody want to be known as The Man Who Died after Cowardly Battle with Cancer
4160,Except health experts everywhere in Asia took as a given coronavirus was airborne basically from day 1 because research on camels during MERS by Middle Eastern researchers showed that.
4161,"(They were able to measure viral DNA, admittedly not the best measure, in barns with infected camels even around the corner from the animals."
4162,Studies of disease spread in hospitals also indicated airborne spread.).
4163,"Even if the CDC was ignorant of or distrusted that research, the Diamond Princess convinced Japanese health officials right away that Covid has airborne transmission and they were lobbying the CDC for months to acknowledge it."
4164,So the CDC was at a minimum 5-6 years out of date and willfully remained ignorant for over a year.

4193,"The sad part is, the reasoning for it being downplayed was to keep the economy open and businesses running."
4194,Now the best way to keep everything open is by getting vaccinated...
4195,Generally accepting of science is an overstatement and very misleading.
4196,"Don’t fall for this one, people."
4197,"Look at their recent history regarding gender, sex, abortion, climate change or environment in general, genetics, mental health/neurology, nature &amp; nurture, etc."

4205,She has a small chance of getting a mild case and transmitting it to her unvaccinated BF.
4206,The BF and his family are not safe.

4215,When I think about the cataclysmic shifts headed our way from ecocide.
4216,"The migration of hundreds of millions, the resource wars from this, the resulting famines, and the increases disease prevalence, it's a bit stunning to think of how much disruption came from something that led to a loss of 0.12% of the population."
4217,I am of the belief that by the end of this century humans will number in the range of 1B.
4218,That's more than almost anytime in history.
4219,It's also about 90% less than now.
4220,Just stunning to reflect on.
4221,"It's a possibility, they have no idea whether it's true."
4222,"We do know that some vaccines work like that; an initiation, waiting months (or longer), then a final shot, and that's it for decades or life."
4223,Covid patients that are obviously not going to be make it need to be euthanized quickly to make room for those that may have a chance.

Also for reference 90% of the population if vaccinated so roughly 40% of deaths come from 10% of the population

4449,Of course it’s hard.
4450,But there are many who didn’t even try to take minimal precautions to help limit the spread.
4451,Such as wearing a mask  at church or going into a store.
4452,Last eat before a vaccine I would meet with friends for outdoor gatherings or eating at a restaurant outdoors.

4467,"94% apparently lol

Edit: assuming it's consistent across the nation ofc."
4468,"Hi, sorry, just wanted to highlight that everyone in this thread seems to be referring to England, not the UK."
4469,"*must not get political, must not get political*

In Wales, we have to wear masks by law in shops/large indoor areas and public transport still."
4470,Social distancing is still recommended and the work from home mandate has only been partially lifted.
4471,There also aren't gigs happening outside of pre-approved test schemes.
4472,"From my experience here, masks are just part of life."
4473,I've never seen someone refuse to wear them in a shop and it's pretty common to see old people go for walks in their masks.
4474,The biggest thing I've noticed is the young.
4475,"The chavs at the back of the train who blast their music and throw chips at each other never used to wear masks, despite the rules."
4476,"Since Delta has started ripping through the young population in England, all the kids I come across have all started wearing masks."
4477,Thank you for your account.

4481,Thanks again.
4482,"If you get the jab, I think we should still give people knucks"
4483,"Peru has a somewhat older population tha  India, though."
4484,"So for equal conditions, I would expect fewer deaths in India."
4485,"Yay, it's only too late!"
4486,"Actually, we ""entered"" that wave in early July (exponential growth started back then)."
4487,"But only now are case numbers high enough for the general public to notice, I guess."
4488,"We're close to a weekly rate of 50 cases per 100k, which used to be the ""more restrictions are needed"" threshold before we had vaccines."
4489,Yes the vast majority of those with one dose are simply those waiting on the second dose.
4490,You can have a look at the travelling tabby covid site which graphs first and second doses over time and see that the two dose vaccination rate is roughly that of the one dose vaccination rate 8 weeks ago.
4491,Another pro-lifer proving he’s anything but.
4492,where else would a vaccine go?
4493,?
4494,&gt; Me thinks we’ll be needing boosters forever.
4495,Me thinks we will not.
4496,&gt; Just like the flu shot every fall is probably a good idea.
4497,"It's been a bit of meme, but it bears repeating: Covid-19 is not like the flu."
4498,"And in this case, that's actually a good thing."
4499,The flu is caused by multiple different viruses of the same family.
4500,"Not different variants, actually different viruses."
4501,So that's one problem.
4502,The next one is that flu viruses mutate even more rapidly than coronaviruses.
4503,"And to top that all up, the genetic data of influenzaviruses is segmented into several strands, as opposed to having a single long strand of RNA like coronaviruses."
4504,"This means that if 2 different influenzaviruses infect the same cell, that cell can produce new influenzaviruses using RNA segments from both of the two invaders, mixing and matching to create new forms of the virus."
4505,All these properties together result in the fact that vaccinating against the flu is vastly more difficult than vaccinating against anything else that we have vaccines against.
4506,It's also why the flu shot is the only commonly used vaccine that is updated seasonally.
4507,"Other vaccines, such as childhood vaccines, have a few shots (1-3 typically) and then you're done."
4508,So why then do we still need a booster for covid-19?
4509,Because we're not sure yet what the best prime-boost interval is.
4510,The childhood vaccines I mentioned before all have considerably longer delays between shots than the covid-19 vaccines.
4511,"But running a vaccine with a 6+ month delay between shots through several trial phases amidst an ongoing pandemic was not a good idea, so vaccine researchers essentially took the shortest interval that still made sense: a few weeks."
4512,But our experience with other vaccines suggest that longer intervals will provide a much more robust and long lasting protection.
4513,"Based on death certificate reporting 600 people died of Covid during the latest reported week, and it will likely be higher this week based on the daily reports."
4514,So yes we are at 100 deaths from Covid a day.
4515,"The death toll based on death certificates and excess deaths has been consistently higher than that based on covid testing, so the idea that the daily counts are full of people dying in car crashes while covid positive is just not reality."
4516,So there has not been any reports?
4517,Does anybody even care anymore?
4518,"As terrible as it sounds thr reality is most people just don't care about thr Pandemic anymore, for many it's over and covid-19 is just another virus."
4519,Hair loss is not a side effect of any vaccine.
4520,Pierce is nowhere near that high.
4521,I'm on City Council in one of the cities and the last figure I got on Monday was 48% for my city.
4522,I'm on the Pierce County Regional Council as well and when we were briefed last month on the aggregate numbers for Pierce we were 10% behind the statewide average and 20% below Seattle Metro.
4523,You are very naive.
4524,"Hospitilisations are already 1/4 of what they were at the peak of the pandemic, and we are in summer with schools closed."
4525,"There really is nothing to stop cases and hospitalitions rising come winter, and it's highly likely we will see reintroductin of restrictions in a few months time."
4526,"Regarding covid death stats, they are also tracked by death certificates, and the covid death count by what is reported on the death certificates has been consistently higher than the daily death counts based on covid testing."
4527,"Your comment reminds me of all the people acting like covid was over last summer, or saying that variants were nonsense on this sub in January."
4528,But I'll be accussed of scaremongering for stating the obvious.
4529,My boyfriend and I both received the Pfizer vaccine and we haven't experienced any abnormal hair loss.
4530,"Obviously I can't speak for others, though."
4531,"If it's become a bothersome issue for you, I recommend addressing it with a doctor, if you can."
4532,"So beginning in August 2019, before Covid, I was my husband's caregiver."
4533,His various conditions kept us both in our own lockdown.
4534,My husband passed (not due to Covid) in June 2020.
4535,"Here in California, many places were closed off."
4536,So I remained in lockdown.
4537,I've followed all restrictions.
4538,I'm fully vaxxed.
4539,"When the CDC said in May 2021 that we could remove our masks indoors, I kept wearing mine."
4540,Delta proved my decision was right.
4541,"Keep in mind, I was locked down months before Covid."
4542,"Thanks to the Delta variant, and to those who value playtime over actually helping to end the pandemic, my responsible choices are still limited."
4543,"I've canceled many plans, and gave up on making new ones."
4544,Because it's the right thing to do.
4545,- Am I loving this?
4546,NO!!!
4547,- Do I resent those who insist on prolonging the pandemic?
4548,YES!!!
4549,"- Does any of the above absolve me of my responsibility to keep on doing my part, no matter what?"
4550,"HELL, NO!!!"
4551,"But it does make me a major advocate for vaccine and mask mandates, so that we adults can get back to living our lives, responsibly."
4552,"[Here is good information from 27 July](https://www.covid-arg.com/post/how-many-covid-patients-in-hospital-are-vaccinated-an-update)

the risk (of hospitalisation) to unvaccinated people under 50 is around 10 times higher* than the risk to vaccinated people."
4553,the risk (of hospitalisation) to unvaccinated people over 50 is around 12 times higher* than the risk to vaccinated people.
4554,The concept of vaccine equity - either it being desirable or normal - is absurd...
4555,"The two main factors determining mortality for COVID-19 are old age and obesity, are far more prevalent in certain areas of the world, so it makes sense for vaccination to take a much higher priority there..."
4556, You’re implying you’ll have a stage to play on at this rate
4557,Lambda reporting is likely little more than scaremongering.
4558,"The Lambda variant emerged months before Delta, yet it never even got close to gaining dominance except in specific regions that didn't have any other highly transmissible variant at the time."
4559,"If you look at the relative prevalence chart of different variants ([link](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/gisaid/global)), you'll note that Lambda peaked at about 3% of all sequenced samples around April of this year."
4560,"At that time, Delta was already at 10%."
4561,"Since then, Delta has increased its prevalence to 86%, while Lambda has gradually declined to 1%."
4562,I think you completely missed the point and maybe misread?
4563,"I’ve had the two Moderna shots and stopped wearing a mask, now with all of the contradictory information regarding CDC guidance it seems like we’re all probably going to get it no matter what we do."
4564,&gt;It's probably reasonable to expect that antibody rates are high in children too due to how rampant spread likely was in schools at the peak.
4565,"Depends what you mean by high, but no I wouldn't expect it to be even above 50%."
4566,"No kids are vaccinated, and infection rates have not been that high."
4567,"I set my boundaries at ""resets progress significantly""."
4568,"If you look at deaths and hospitalisations as a proportion of cases in the UK's latest wave compared to previous waves, the vaccines are demonstrably working incredibly well."
4569,"We've lifted remaining restrictions, and that is still holding true."
4570,"I think ""escape"" needs to mean ""significantly overcomes the vaccine's ability to prevent serious illness and death"", and with the UK's example over the last few months I don't think Delta qualifies for that."
4571,"Boosters and therapeutics will continue to erode the effects of the virus, but we're already at a manageable state and that will only get better as we continue to vaccinate holdouts."
4572,Thanks about the vaccines btw.
4573,"Don't get me wrong, there is much to criticise about the UK's response to the pandemic overall, but I think our vaccination effort is showing the path out of covid being a society-crippling crisis, and into something not-ideal-but-manageable-and-getting-better."
4574,"I hope the States follows, especially once vaccine-skeptics realise the billions of people already vaccinated aren't keeling over or growing horns or whatever they're expecting."
4575,"In their defense, most of those types don’t give a shit about healthcare or education so I guess it’s business as usual?"

4582,LoL.
4583,Anyone who is a minority in the USA has known that cops are absolute garbage and always have been.
4584,And a stupid tan.
4585,I was reading a study in the BMJ which suggests that people infected with Covid should have better protection against a broader range of Covid variants.
4586,Still needs to be peer reviewed etc.
4587,There's also suggestions that people who had Covid carry a smaller viral load when they're exposed to it again (making it less likely they spread it).
4588,"Anecdotally, I went to a gig with my little brother last week."
4589,"He (single vaccinated) now has a really bad case of Covid, my partner (double vaxxed) is symptomless but positive and I (previously infected, single vaxxed) came back negative 🤷"
4590,I am not a pessimist but I think delta is a new beginning for the virus.
4591,I have never seen any variant who had so much sub lineages like delta.
4592,Delta continues to evolve which I worry.
4593,"For example in my country, I saw some delta lineages which carry N501Y and E484K(worst mutation for vaccines) also we have AY.1(K417N),AY.2, AY.3."
4594,If we had something like covid 19.2 it would be delta
4595,The EU is at 63% with at least one dose and the US is at 60%.
4596,"I'd hardly call that ""much higher""."

4614,"In hindsight it was absurd but as much as people like to bash the government for that, it made sense at the time (some other things like walking dogs but not kids, or being able to go to bars but not parks when the lockdowns began to be lifted, didn't, but the core measure did)."

4664,Federal government cannot shut down interstate travel.
4665,"i get what they're hypothesizing, but it's all conjecture at this point."
4666,I think the key takeaway is that they're realizing that vast majority of Americans will not take another booster shot after this 3rd.

4671,"It showed similar results with Pfizer, with efficacy against infection falling to around 42% after 5 months."

4726,I just checked after posting this and 75% of the ADULT population is fully vaccinated.
4727,Then 87% of the adult population has at least one dose.
4728,"That would put overall population vaccination rates somewhere between 50-60%, but that'll go up quickly now they're vaccinating kids (I think it's 16-18 year olds)."
4729,https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/?_ga=2.147523831.1725178129.1603824890-1705382479.1584646583
4730,So what do you want to happen?
4731,"90% of adults have had 1 dose, they'll all have had their second in the coming weeks."
4732,"As the headline says, 94% of adults have antibodies."
4733,"Frankly, I don't care about vaccinated people passing it between vaccinated people, as the risk of either serious illness or death is minimal, even if it hasn't gone away altogether."
4734,"Unfortunately, some frail and unhealthy people are going to keep dying of this forever, along with a handful of otherwise healthy edge-cases."
4735,"And I mean, for the remaining unvaccinated, they're taking their own chances."
4736,**Edit:** BTW your efficacy claim for Pfizer was significantly wrong - https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-58257863
4737,I was wondering if anyone is experiencing hair loss who took Pfizer?

4757,"Then it’s anyone over 18, then done."
4758,Shouldn’t be too long.
4759,It's good to remember that Alpha is still out there too...
4760,So the vaccine is still helping with that.
4761,Speculation.
4762,"Anyway, perhaps the dosing schedule should have just been 3 shots from the getgo."
4763,"We may find that the ""booster"" truly kicks the immune system into gear."
4764,Studies have shown delaying the 2nd dose up to 12 weeks (vs 3/4 as advised) produces a far more robust immune response.
4765,If the original approval was for a 3 dose scheduling would Americans vaccinating their population first (in terms of months) still be offensive?
4766,"Long covid is a significant problem, and is going to cause serious healthcare consequences going forward."
4767,America has every right to take care of their people with their vaccines first if they so choose.
4768,This is why we vote in America.
4769,Florida has been running a 20% test positive rate which is a clear indication that there’s not enough testing being done.
4770,There are a lot of undocumented cases there.
4771,4 out of 5 dentists got Covid also recommended Colgate
4772,"Adults vaccinated is much more than 70 - its overall population that’s, the new measure since they started vaccinating kids, which is at that level"
4773,"But those aren't the only metrics that count, and I feel like you're kind of shifting the goalposts here."
4774,"Doesn't matter if you've been vaccinated or not, if you develop another active infection, you can pass it on to everyone just the same as an unvaccinated person."
4775,"Additionally, your assumption about them not suffering severe illness is also incorrect."
4776,"At the moment, the majority in our ICUs are fully vaccinated."
4777,"Yeah, here in Ohio, everyone dropped their masks a long time ago, even before the CDC recommendation."
4778,"As for the 8 months thing, I honestly don't know."
4779,The CDC has not said a single thing about why you have to wait 8 months.
4780,"I mean, if they said ""everyone will still be well protected until that point according to the data we have"" or maybe ""waiting 8 months allows for a more robust immune response"", etc., I'd feel better about the wait, but there doesn't seem to be any real reasoning for it, and all the data that is out there on waning immunity with the Pfizer vaccine suggests it happens way before then (about the 5-6 month mark)."
4781,".... And the thing is, one doesn't even need to trust science anymore to believe vaccine is safe."
4782,"Statistics don't lie, by now millions upon millions of people have had the jab."

4786,"me, I was fully vaccinated and I got it."

4789,Beyond happy with this decision.
4790,"Between this and mandatory masking in schools, I’m beyond grateful he’s actually listening to science."
4791,However.
4792,Virtual learning needs to be offered.
4793,It’s a pipe dream to assume that year two of this pandemic can be done like a normal school year.
4794,Covid cases are going to jump in kids without a doubt and it’s going to force districts to go virtual.
4795,I sincerely hope the gov touches on this during his speech today.
4796,Families need to know an effective plan is in place for when cases spike again here.
4797,As they’ve already done so quickly.
4798,“These results are highly encouraging.
4799,"They suggest that the third booster may restore the vaccine efficacy to its original levels”

Right, but the concern here is waning immunity."
4800,"So is the plan to re-vaxx every 8 months, from here on out?"
4801,My gf is a nurse at one of the major hospitals in Chicago and she's about fed up.
4802,There are six patients to every nurse and it's terrible.
4803,She comes home every day just drained and I honestly don't know how she does it anymore.
4804,She says her boss is a good manager but his hands are tied from the higher ups.
4805,Her hospital truly values profits over the staff and patients.
4806,It's fucking sick.
4807,She's in a program now to become a diabetic educator so she's just holding on long enough to complete the program.
4808,It's really a vascular disease more than anything.

4811,I had a friend that was all about 5G until I pointed out that the networks would much rather him be a forever consuming drone then be dead.
4812,I think I broke his brain for a second but he eventually conceded.
4813,"Nj here, our governor also announced no virtual option for school this year."
4814,Which is absurd and so out of touch.
4815,"I understand the teachers are beyond overworked, and asking them to be super tech savvy and run a class online with limited resources is a lot."
4816,But.
4817,It’s hugely discriminating to omit the remote learning option.
4818,So many disabled/sick students benefit from it.
4819,I have been homeschooling my three kids (under vax age) since March 2020.
4820,I’m sending them back to public school because there mental health has declined so much just from 17 months of this pandemic.
4821,"We have mandatory masking at schools, and the gov is supposed to announce today mandatory vaccines for all teachers and school staff."
4822,Both of these decisions make me feel safe sending my kids to school.
4823,However the remote learning option needs to be available.
4824,"And as we see cases spike, especially with children, I’ve no doubt many states will revert back to online learning."
4825,I want nothing more than things to be back to normal.
4826,But I’m also willing to homeschool my kids as long as necessary to help save teachers and other students.
4827,You know what else is bad for you?
4828,Prolonged isolation and crippling loneliness.
4829,I remember the UK COVID subreddit being full of this during lockdown.
4830,"Its not enough to see lockdown as difficult, but necessary."
4831,"Instead, you need to think its actually a great thing, that anyone who wants to go out to bars is just an alcoholic, that anyone that wants to see friends and family are just extroverted and can do zoom calls instead."
4832,"That's without even considering abusive households, homes with a lack of space etc."
4833,My point is about the expecting different results.
4834,Of course Delta is going to lead to people having a higher viral load.
4835,The previous results won't apply.
4836,Maybe read the comment I was replying to.
4837,Vaccines were out late last year and readily available for free to all adults and kids over 12 by May.
4838,The only time people were told to wait it out as long as possible is when the hospitals are over capacity.
4839,Like when the vaccine is readily available along with masks and yet people refuse both.
4840,Boggles the mind honestly.
4841,I have heard before this is called intradermal injection..  not 100% sure.
4842,But I also heard is that this method is way more painful.
4843,Please clap.

4858,We kept waiting and tested everyday just assuming it was a matter of time.
4859,Thankfully our vaccines did their job.
4860,No symptoms even after her cough near us for a bit.
4861,"Just goes to show you, yes there will be breakthrough cases, but anecdotally and statistically the vaccines are still incredibly effective against covid and delta variant."

4882,It's the hospitals.
4883,"The US is in bad shape, particularly Florida, a common tourist destination for Europeans and Canadians."
4884,"If tourists start coming in, there's still going to be breakthrough cases, even if the rules were vaccinated only."
4885,"Very likely, it'd be vaccinated only or negative covid test, meaning some are vulnerable once they get into the US."
4886,This adds to the strain on healthcare systems.
4887,"Furthermore, more tourists means more people doing vacation things, which tend to come along with higher risks of accidents."
4888,We have areas with hospitals that may actually be unable to properly treat people from normal accidents and medical conditions due to the covid surge.
4889,It has nothing to do with thinking these people are more of a risk for bringing covid in and everything to do with the US already struggling to take care of its own population and being unable to add foreign tourists on top of it.

4924,"&gt;Patrick’s comments, one video clip of which had been viewed more than 845,000 times on Twitter as of earlyFriday morning, drew immediatecriticism, with some calling the lieutenant governor’s assertion unfounded."
4925,"“Making a statement that casts blame on a racial or ethnic minority for the spread of disease is a well-known racist trope that predates most of us,” Jorge Caballero, a former instructor at the Stanford University School of Medicine who is now working as health data scientist, told The Washington Post."
4926,"The day before Abbott announced his positive coronavirus diagnosis, videos posted online show the governor delivering remarks and interacting with a maskless crowd at an indoor event."

4942,** I know it's a little more severe based on the person but still from what we know being vaccinated makes COVID a moderate inconvenience for most people.

4951,If you were hoping for more from the vaccine you should adjust your outlook.
4952,These are some of the most effective vaccines we have ever developed.

4954,Haha true.

4971,"Uhhhh some vaccines do actually use live viruses, the viruses are attenuated for the purpose of the vaccine though, which in  layman’s terms means its a weakened version."
4972,Im okay with that when they have years of studies to back their efficacy.
4973,Again much different than a jab that uses Our genetic coding material to replicate copies of the spike protein….
4974,Which has been proven can shed onto others that was rushed onto humanity.

4976,"She’s not even considered an exposure if he just tested positive yesterday, unless he had symptoms that day or something."
4977,Typically only people who have had contact 48 hours prior to positive test or symptom onset would be considered contacts.
4978,It’s a podcast done by virologists and immunologists.
4979,They basically just read over latest papers and give their opinions and analysis.
4980,The show existed before COVID but obviously much more popular now.
4981,“This week in Virology”.
4982,It has been an amazing resource during these times.
4983,No sensible person wants to wear masks forever
4984,28 year old here in healthy condition outside of being in the ER three weeks ago with a breakthrough case of Covid.
4985,I may be able to answer that question.
4986,I had both Pfizer shots and ended up getting the monoclonal antibody infusion after getting progressively worse.
4987,It’s probably the only reason I didn’t end up on a ventilator or dead.
4988,Thankfully in Southern California and was at one of the top hospitals.
4989,My doctor in the ER was saying it wasn’t readily available at many other places back then.
4990,I’m glad more hospitals are using it now
4991,At the moment this is really the only way to look at it.
4992,I've only seen some non-peer reviewed write ups testing against Sinovac.
4993,"It's clearly far less infectious, been around a good while and is not some new delta variant."
4994,Could it become something?
4995,Who knows but as of now there's no reason to think it's even close to delta in terms of impact.
4996,I’m also Italian
4997,"Too much Fox News (even tho Fox is now requiring it’s employees to be vaccinated, or wear masks and submit to testing … how rich)."
4998,Vaccine uptake.
4999,Supply could be infinite.
5000,Doesn’t matter if half the population believes their drunken uncle that says it’ll turn you into a lizard person or track you.
5001,It’s not just the US either.
5002,There is less than expected usage in multiple countries.
5003,IMO variants will never stop at this point.
5004,It’ll be like the flu and we’ll target the prevalent variant each year.
5005,"As long as everyone who wants a vaccine can get one, that’s the bar I care most about."
5006,"Beyond that, stockpiling based on assuming everyone will accept one is a bit silly at this point."
5007,ABs waning are part of the human body's immune systems process.
5008,They don't constantly just float around looking for something to do.
5009,There are multiple studies from convalescent patients showing that ABs decline after a period and then level out.
5010,"ABs sort of go ""dormant"" for lack of a better term and then B and T cells ramp up production when an infection is detected."
5011,The culture war has not told them how to feel about this treatment.
5012,Therefore they don't have an opinion one way or the other.
5013,You may be right.
5014,That’s one way to be able to tell who I need to stay 30 ft away from.

5022,Just stay away
5023,"Yeah, I'm thinking, this was obvious in *foresight."
5024,*
5025,There's also a chilling effect when people hear the hospital is full and wait times are long
5026,There is a link in the post about the rate of myocarditis from the vaccine vs from being infected.
5027,It's a lot more common from being infected.
5028,"In fact, early in the pandemic, it was one of the big stories - a whole basketball team got covid and there was a concern that it was going to impact athletes more because they almost all had myocarditis."
5029,https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/29633697/heart-condition-linked-covid-19-fuels-power-5-concern-season-viability%3fplatform=amp
5030,I remember older people got Sinovac and then in June they started pfizer for younger people once it was available.
5031,Then they started giving a dose of pfizer to those who got Sinovac last month or so.
5032,Now they are actually giving out 2nd doses of Pfizer to those people.
5033,"So there is a sizeable group in Turkey, mostly older people or those who work in Healthcare, who got 2 doses of Sinovac and 2 doses of Pfizer in the span of 6 months."
5034,"Russia was originally only counting a covid death if it was confirmed by autopsy so they were reporting 55,000."
5035,Unfortunately by underplaying the impact so much nobody got vaccinated so now they are upping the figures and trying to get the vaccination rates up.
5036,"The policies are terrible, I agree."
5037,Why can’t you get him tested sooner?
5038,Or at least go to Walgreens and pick up a BinaxNow and if it’s positive you’ll know what you’re potentially dealing with.

5040,As reference lookup Trumps regeneron treatment in Oct. price is fixed
5041,"We won’t ever be free of COVID at this point, can only hope to get vaccination rate high enough to make it an inconvenience."
5042,"The timeline for having the entire world vaccinated to a point where America would enjoy some benefit from it, is just way too far off to consider right now."
5043,Also that there are still people in denial despite all the illness and death.
5044,"Ok, thank you."
5045,So they had no issues entering ?
5046,It’s reassuring because I’m leaving the US as a canadian but want to re- enter and don’t want to push my luck ie they turn me away.
5047,Because I’m here for a wedding and some other events
5048,There has been noted vaccine hesitancy among the Black community.
5049,"I know here in NYC, Brooklyn and the Bronx are the boroughs with the worst rates of vaccination; even Staten Island is doing better."
5050,"True, mine are older than that."
5051,But to not allow the information to go out in the anonymous way it used to?

5056,Did you read the article?
5057,Says they were there for their husband which was vaccinated.
5058,"Sure, that might be fine, however it may encourage some people to try to get infected."
5059,US covid figures are 640k dead so far if you compare it to the Spanish Flu about 650k died.
5060,"The Spanish Flu was the worst pandemic for the last 100 years, the US population is higher now 330 million compared to 100 million in 1918."
5061,"I know, I'm keeping them both home, the soonest I can get them in for a test is Monday."
5062,"This is utter bullshit though, I just had to argue with a school nurse that sending my youngest to school was dangerous and a bad idea...they only implemented masking on Wednesday, and my children have been wearing masks since school started."
5063,What the living fuck is going on with these guidelines?
5064,!
5065,"Yes, the safety trials are finishing up now."
5066,"It will decrease deaths, hospitalizations, long haulers and work stoppage."
5067,They should still do something.
5068,What is pretty similar?
5069,How much worse of each is acceptable?
5070,I have absolutely no idea and I’m not going to try to play an expert like many others.
5071,I just can’t imagine this is the only solution for a country that is rich in so many ways.
5072,"I'm focusing on the US, because that's what I am most familiar with."
5073,"I've read very little about the Sinovac, Sinopharm, Sputnik, and other vaccines."
5074,I at least feel better that Israeli surveys have said side effects have generally been milder than the second dose.
5075,"It'd be messed up if they were generally worse, because then would they just keep getting worse and worse until we get to a point where we seriously dread our annual booster (like our 20th booster)?"
5076,"I think that there's dihydrogen monoxide used in the vaccine, or the production of the vaccine."
5077,And we all know that everyone who ingests or comes in contact with dihydrogen monoxide will die.
5078,I believe the national labs have had this in place.
5079,The one I work at has these mandates.
5080,"Right now we are all required to wear masks again, unvaxxed are tested."
5081,You can be terminated for not following the mandates and for lying during contact tracing.
5082,"Also, no work travel, generally no outside people are still not allowed."
5083,A lot of people still working from home at least part-time.
5084,Our lab is vaxxed at 90% i believe.
5085,(5k people or so).
5086,"I have taken 2shots of pfizer vaccine, as the booster roll outs are starting, is it safe/effective if I get my third booster shot with Moderna?"
5087,They're begging for it.
5088,I'm hard of hearing and rely on lipreading a lot.
5089,"I accept that masks are important, and I've been wearing masks consistently since they came in... but I can't understand a word anyone is saying to me now (outside the house)."
5090,It's been absolute hell.
5091,"And I'm really tired of sanctimonious people who *aren't* dealing with that telling me that ""If you can't handle a mask you're being a baby!"""
5092,"(Technically the issue isn't me wearing a mask, it's everyone else, but ""masks as a general thing"" is the issue.)"
5093,"So I accept that it's a thing we have to do, I would just like other people to accept it can also be actively harmful."

5139,"Sad part is that people who legitimately can not be vaccinated or can not get immunity from vaccines (immune compromised/people going through chemo/etc), when they contract COVID, they will probably get sicker than normal people who did not get vaccinated thus when push comes shove, those people who COULD NOT get the vaccine may be triaged out since their potential survivability may be lower than that of people who just did not take the vaccine."

5270,"In a viral infection, the best antibodies to have are home-made ones that you already had before the virus shows up."

5280,The problem is that unless you’re wealthy the gop does not care about you.
5281,That’s why they fought against the pandemic relief payments.
5282,"&gt;If you are vaccinated you have nothing to worry about 

BULLFUCKING SHIT

Vaccinated are STILL getting way too much long covid problems for me to not be worried."
5283,"Yeah, you PROBABLY wont die, but covid can still fuck your shit up."
5284,I am thankful for the more stringent mandate that was just passed yesterday.
5285,"However wanted to highlight the difficulties epidemiologists and gov officials are having/ going to have...22-27% of the population (not just individuals, but families with children that cannot get the vaccine) that are most likely affluent, non minority, possibly well educated are actively against the safety/betterment of society..."

5292,Nothing was going to change these people's minds anyway.
5293,Even if this article didn't exist they would come up with some other kind of crackpot theory to justify why they're not getting vaccinated.
5294,who is asking you to do that?

5313,Yeah agreed but this virus is endemic.
5314,"It's not going away, at least any time soon."
5315,The best option for someone right now is to be vaccinated so if you do get COVID it's as mild as it can possibly be and your risk of hospitalization is as low as possible.
5316,"The more vaccinations, the less hospitalizations, and while the vaccine efficacy is high (for the first 6 months after your shots) the less the virus is spread."
5317,"&gt; I just heard some other predictions that the US could start seeing 200,000 plus new infections every day."
5318,This is so frustrating and preventable for the most part.

5330,"Also, I know Pfizer and moderna have been working on a variant booster."
5331,"Where exactly are these companies on that booster, and if it's around the corner would it be better to just give the 3rd booster as the variant booster instead?"
5332,It wasn't political - it was economics.
5333,The US economy is suffering heavily under COVID.
5334,The government was desperate to correct it as soon as possible.
5335,They severely underestimated vaccine hesitancy as well as the spread of variants.
5336,"Simply put, American corporations were struggling, the US rushed to fix it and made it worse as is tradition."
5337,Its ok GOP is fine with sacrificing the old and weak.

5363,"It's weird because when a loved one tells you they're vaccinated mentally it's like ""cool all good!"""
5364,then it hits even harder when it's not all good
5365,The study also is using PCR tests to compare viral loads.
5366,These tests capture both inactive and active virus.
5367,So it’s possible that the immune response triggered by the vaccines is lowering the active load detected.

5419,It’s real easy when you can convince voters with “see how bad it would be under a Democrat?
5420,!” while pointing to the current situation.
5421,I don’t understand why the CDC only tracks (or at least reports) covid cases in vaccinated people as breakthroughs if they result in hospitalization or death.
5422,All that does is get in the way of accuracy and throw gasoline into dumpster fire conspiracy theories.

5431,"They only opened up third shots for 65+ a couple weeks ago, and now 40+ can get it."
5432,"I hope they accelerate vaccine approval for under 12 kids in the US, sooner rather than later."
5433,It seems likely that the risk of waiting is greater than the risk of early authorization.
5434,Yeah because businesses are totally going to follow all the rules after the past 18 months and are definitely going to turn away paying customers if they aren't vaccinated.

5690,There is a theory that China has managed to handle Covid-19 a lot better than other regions because they already have built up immunity from other Coronaviruses that have historically circulated there.
5691,"SARS is the most high profile outbreak, but there are many other less harmful coronaviruses that have circulated in Asia, likely starting in China or other places where wildlife and humans interact in tightly packed places."
5692,"I’m trying to guess who said that and why, but out of context I cannot remember."
5693,But I understand the sentiment behind the statement and of course the statement itself shows they aren’t interested in protecting people.
5694,"Yes, why do they want this disease infecting everyone, or at least “the right people”?"
5695,"I feel like “they” know more about that than we do, but if I could hazard a guess, I believe they want people infected so they can reach heard immunity, and they are doing that because any other solution disrupts their economic prospects."
5696,"Basically, I believe it’s all about money/business, I feel like that’s the main thing motivating someone to want someone else to get sick and/or die."
5697,I think it’s more out of a resistance to change more than anything.
5698,Republicans are entrenched in tradition.
5699,Let’s say it’s an ideological war and it’s really about wiping out the Dems or hurting the working class.

5710,*
5711,Which most importantly means a reduction in hospital overloads which impacts not only covid but other regular services.
5712,So u/seemebreakthis \- assume 100% of the US was vaccinated - Delta would still be floating around - you are correct here.
5713,We would still be passing it and people would still be getting ill from it but in FAR fewer numbers.
5714,"As it stands, if you have a medical emergency unrelated to covid right now in some of our southern states...good luck to you."
5715,"Even if rates of infection drop between now and then, I can't see how we won't see an increase in rates around the holidays as vaccines protect against severe illness and death, but do little to prevent the spread of the delta variant."
5716,Then you throw in the seasonality of the virus and the things are going to get interesting in the next few months.
5717,"As someone who lives in a highly vaccinated area, I'm really hoping high vaccination rates will help blunt the spread of delta in the upcoming fall/winter."
5718,I guess we'll see in the next few months.

5736,yep exactly.
5737,"someone earlier in this subreddit said canada is already mix and matching due mostly to supplies without any safety issues, but I dont know if that is true or not."
5738,Doesn't this mean they would be more likely to spread it as well as they have no idea they are infected?
5739,"&gt; In my county (in upstate NY), since the start of July, 40% of new cases have been in fully-vaccinated people."
5740,I wouldn't be at all surprised if it reaches 50% by the time boosters start in September.
5741,Making it seem like vaccinated people have zero reason to take precautions is not helpful.
5742,You've fallen victim to narrowed vision.
5743,"You're in the US, a country in which huge numbers of people are vaccinated."
5744,"And even where you are, it's still the case that a majority of cases are in unvaccinated people, by your own admission!"
5745,"But the WHO is thinking of the whole world, and there are plenty of countries where hardly anyone is vaccinated, and countries where they have no access to vaccines."
5746,Their statement is very very true.
5747,The overwhleming majority of covid-19 spread in the world is among unvaccinated people.
5748,Vaccinating more people for the first time would reduce spread much more quickly than giving boosters.
5749,"If we can do the latter without slowing down the former, great, let's do both."
5750,"But if the latter actually does slow down the former, then it's a bad tradeoff."
5751,&gt; They can't have it both ways: we're told constantly that we're only supposed to care about hospitalizations and deaths.
5752,And then we're also told that letting the virus spread freely leads to the development of more variants.
5753,But apparently spreading freely among vaccinated people just doesn't count?
5754,"Here, you're a bit confused."
5755,"You've been seeing a lot of the messaging that's trying to counter claims that ""vaccines don't work"" because vaccinated people can still spread Delta (although with lower probability)."
5756,"The counter to that is that even with Delta, vaccines are still extremely effective against hospitalization and death, so for your personal protection, getting vaccinated definitely works really really well."
5757,"But if anyone told you that means it's the *only* thing that matters, they were wrong - and maybe they didn't say that explicitly and you just interpreted it that way."
5758,It's the main thing that matters *for the individual*.
5759,"But from a public health perspective, overall levels of spread have always mattered, and I've never seen the WHO or CDC say otherwise."
5760,"As for ""apparently spreading freely among vaccinated people"", you're again confused."
5761,"What does ""freely"" mean?"
5762,"Vaccination significantly slows the spread of even Delta, but not to a level where it can be fully contained by vaccination alone."
5763,"So of course it counts, but the point is this: Getting unvaccinated people vaccinated for the first time, reduces spread a lot more than giving vaccinated people boosters, from what we know so far."
5764,"Both of these things will reduce transmission, so both are valuable, but based on current knowledge, getting more people vaccinated for the first time slows the spread by a lot more, than giving boosters does."
5765,So that's the tradeoff they're talking about.
5766,"Your comment is full of misconceptions, and I urge you to let go of your apparent disbelief and anger, and really think about it, based on the knowledge that these recommendations are coming from people who know the subject a lot better."
5767,"Consider that they know something you're not thinking of, and try to find out what that is, rather than throwing up your hands and pretending they're idiots."

5769,Smoking is an addiction so I get that a _little_ bit more than someone who refused a vaccine.
5770,Clear out an ICU of a non-vaxxed if a vaxxed person needs it.
5771,Why is he your buddy?
5772,"Right, but even with a slight reduction of salary, the employee still comes out ahead because of the much lower COL.

As long as the employee ends up with more cash, the employee is happy."
5773,* Assuming they're happy with their remote-work location of-course.
5774,"No, you can't disregard it - but you can't point to it and say that it shows that delta causes people to have the same viral load when it's only true for a short period of time - and the duration when the vaxxed viral load is equal to the unvaxxed is small - and the unvaxxed has a much higher area under the curve."
5775,Lines 199-202 of the paper you linked.
5776,Because it’s not being managed as a global supply chain.
5777,Country A is buying supply for their people and aren’t worried about country B.
5778,"Short of the doses being donated, you can’t divert what someone else bought through legal purchase agreements."
5779,It’s on the purchaser to reduce how much they bought so more supply is available for everyone else.
5780,"As long as places like the US stock pile and over buy vs desired usage, the poorer countries will lag in availability."
5781,It’s not up to places like Pfizer to distribute based on global need.
5782,They’re selling to whoever is buying.
5783,Both charts show the peak was last week.
5784,Will the current trend continue and surpass last week’s peak?
5785,"Maybe, but seems pretty inconclusive at this point."
5786,7k a day seems highly unlikely.
5787,Wouldn't this protect the teachers themselves more than the students since vaccinated can still spread it the same?
5788,Just for a shorter amount of time
5789,I'm wondering the same.
5790,Also on Team Pfizer but after hearing Moderna seems to give better protection might try to get that for the booster

5801,"Given that the USA is already at 150K reported cases per day, I'd imagine actual cases might already be over 200K

The silver lining might be that some of the cases are breakthrough cases and relatively minor or asymptomatic, so the patients don't bother getting tested because they don't notice it or they think ""well, I'm already vaxxed"""

6121,"The leadership is fairly spineless when it comes to standing up to extreme politics, especially the far right."
6122,They know their base and don't necessarily agree with them but are afraid of alienating them.

6124,"Agreed on that point, but faced with the possibility of dying from a lack of staff/icu beds or being treated by an unvaxxed nurse i'm taking the nurse every time."
6125,&gt; Vaccine mandates.
6126,That's the issue.
6127,There will be pushback on this.
6128,It's ridiculous to not think people will push back at having something forcefully put into their bodies even if it's for their benefit.
6129,There will always be holdouts and there will always be more avenues for further mutations leading to further breakthrough cases.
6130,I think the partisanship around vaccines is stupid.
6131,The attacks come because people are frustrated that 50-70% of cases and 80-90% of hospitalizations are preventable.
6132,A portion of that includes people doing their damnedest to protect themselves and their families.
6133,So the attacks happen as a way of shaming people into behaving.
6134,But that only works when there's a large vocal majority.
6135,There's too many antivaxxers echoing each other.
6136,I'm not sure it's effective to yell at people to compensate.
6137,"I know we like to bash the US here, but let's be honest."
6138,It is human nature that causes people to resist mandates and dramatic changes in a short period of time.
6139,Not being a US citizen.
6140,"Maybe it was cool to seek out data that made it look like the US was a laughing stock of the Covid experience... but on a global scale, most of the US is (relatively) in a good spot to be honest."
6141,It's not preventable because it's simply too late.
6142,That ship sailed over a year ago and i think it's debatable who's to blame.
6143,We could get to 90-100% vaccinated and all wear masks all day and there would still be Covid out there and we would probably still need an annual shot of some sort.

6216,"The original CDC PCR test documentation specifically mentioned looking for three sequences from ""highly conserved"" regions of the viral genome -- regions of the genome where mutations are not often observed."
6217,"These regions are like the areas  where bullet holes were not observed in returning WWII bombers: https://www.dgsiegel.net/talks/the-bullet-hole-misconception ; it's not that they don't (mutate|get hit), it's that the (virus|aircraft) usually doesn't survive (mutations|hits) in those areas."
6218,You had to get a unanimous verdict for a positive or negative test result -- all three present or all three absent.
6219,IIRC samples which consistently tested with only one or two of the three sequences present were to be reported to CDC for further investigation.
6220,The chance that multiple such mutations would near-simultaneously pop up in the wild and invalidate all three target sequences is very low.
6221,"Thank you, I was getting that impression"
6222,Not for naught.
6223,We're losing the 95% efficacy against hospitalization down to 80-90%.

6436,"&gt; Anyone over 12 in the US can get a free shot that will prevent almost any chance of hospitalization

Most states still require parental consent for anyone under 18 though."
6437,If a 17 year old really wants to be vaccinated but the anti vax parent says no then it’s still illegal in most states for the kid to get the vaccine.
6438,If we’re going to prioritize healthcare for vaccinated folks we need to lower the age at which a person can consent to get vaccinated.
6439,Check out research chemical benzos.
6440,But tread carefully
6441,"If you mean there are no surges in Iceland, you are wrong."
6442,There are also multiple articles about it.
6443,"Here's a recent headline:

&gt;Despite Near-Total Vaccination, Iceland Experiences Its Worse Delta-driven Pandemic Surge"
6444,Just like masks weren’t coming back.
6445,mixed feelings.
6446,But I am gonna say good.
6447,Get ready for fall with these new weak-ass excuses.
6448,Now in pumpkin spice!
6449,Mask mandate?
6450,Just wear the damn mask and get on with your life.
6451,"Also, I wear masks in winter."
6452,Make my face less dry.
6453,No you’re wrong and it’s clear you don’t understand how delta works.
6454,Delta no longer enters the body to multiply like alpha.
6455,Instead it starts multiplying inside the nasal and throat passage.
6456,Outside the reach of our immune system.
6457,After hitting a certain high level threshold it then invaded the body.
6458,This is why people with the vaccine still shed large viral loads with delta and still get sick.
6459,There is no here immunity to delta.
6460,Vaccinated do have a better immune response for now but that could easily change at any point if a more deadly variant emerges with a similar infection pathology.
6461,I just want to understand why.
6462,Pls.
6463,Does anyone know?
6464,To preserve the economy or something?
6465,They need to get the EUA for kids done already but glad this full approval for adults is finally happening.
6466,How are they animals getting COVID and why aren’t the staff wearing masks?
6467,"Oh yeah, I don't disagree that there are a lot of cracks (which is why I said I'm sure there will be a rise); but at least they're trying to mitigate as much as they can."
6468,My youngest graduated from an LAUSD school last year (thank god).
6469,I'm still on the high school's call list and got a call and email Wednesday that they had at least one confirmed case in two classrooms.
6470,They didn't specify whether it was a student or teacher.
6471,I'm curious to see how many of these calls we get over the coming weeks.
6472,It's because Biden pulled us out of Afghanistan     /s
6473,"""Surgis"" was a joke, and a good one at that."
6474,"At some point, vaccinated people will just get fed up, stop caring, and go about their life as usual."
6475,"Scientists need to figure out what to do about this *fast*, as there's no way people will be willing to go into another lockdown."
6476,We had a hard enough time convicting people to social distance the first time.
6477,"And to add to that, I think what I'm trying to make clear is that while the vaccines are very effective at preventing severe symptoms, and seem to do a good job reducing mild symptoms (and long covid) as well, to claim that ""as you have the shot, you're good"" is not supported by any evidence we have right now, unless there is a paper I'm not aware of that shows that the rate of long-term sequelae is let's say 1 in 1000 or 1 in 10000 if you're vaxxed and infected, since you and I agree ""everyone's getting covid at somepoint."""
6478,Agreed.
6479,"I assume if a person is wearing a mask, they're vaccinated and being extra  careful."
6480,I imagine very very few people are not vaccinated and choosing to wear a mask instead.
6481,I think we need to stop thinking about masks and focus on vaccines (for those eligible).
6482,To think Texas only requested five mobile morgues.
6483,I guess everything is bigger in Texas.
6484,We are grandparents.
6485,"So in a way we've been through it all again but with new eyes - the first time when we had our own kids, and the second time where we got to sit back and observe and watch."
6486,I think maybe that is another reason I feel the way I do about it.
6487,Watching the pregnancy and first year or two...
6488,I mean during the pregnancy there's all the shopping and preparing for the new baby... which during a pandemic increases your risk every time you have to go to Target or where ever you shop.
6489,And then all the bathroom breaks because anyone who has been pregnant knows that especially that last trimester you learn very quickly where every restroom is.
6490,Who wants to use a public restroom during a pendmic?
6491,And especially while pregnant?
6492,"And then once baby is here, there's the endless visits... friends, family, neighbors, even coworkers.... everybody who wants to see the baby."
6493,Which is really sweet and wonderful but... Delta virus?
6494,Hmmm.
6495,And are you a jerk if you tell people to stay away?
6496,"So many awkward situations come to mind as well, if you do try to keep socially distanced."
6497,And of course the doctor visits to get all the checkups and regular routine vaccinations.
6498,"It is a busy time, and lots of situations that would make social distancing and making safe choices really challenging."
6499,"I just think that if people really stopped and thought about it, and took their own biological clock out of the equation, and really stopped and thought about what they were about to embark on... and the risks... and the stress.... and the work..."
6500,I just think they might give it some time (for the younger ones who have some time).
6501,"But again that also makes me feel like.... OK, older mom's have higher risk pregnancies, don't they?"
6502,Oh gosh.
6503,I didn't mean to get all into this today!
6504,This is just how I honestly feel.
6505,If one of my kids were to come to me and ask me my thoughts about whether I think they should have another baby...
6506,I'd tell them the exact same thing.
6507,Personally I feel it's way too risky right now.
6508,For mom and baby.
6509,But people are going to do what they are going to do.
6510,Which is why I also feel like everybody should be getting their vaccines and wear masks and social distancing.
6511,To protect the mom's and babies and grandpa's and grandma's and everybody.
6512,lol
6513,That's not how viruses work
6514,"I’m not sure there’s really a good answer, or if there’s even a good measure (or if they are even that good at protecting you or others all that much)."
6515,You know anyone that vapes?
6516,"Just have them try exhaling with the mask on, my wife tried this, it just leaks all over even on supposedly good masks it’s pretty telling that most of the masks you see are probably mostly useless unless you get something like the Narwall mask."
6517,There might be videos on YouTube of others trying the vape test (I didn’t look but we thought it was an interesting experiment).
6518,I'm sure Nestle will be there to help them all.
6519,They won't help them build desalinization plants or send in water purifiers.
6520,But they'll be there to sell them bottled water taken out of someone else's ground source for a 9 million percent markup.
6521,You can rest assured.
6522,Yep hopefully
6523,To be fair he got sick a week after his first dose.
6524,Hi!
6525,I posted the full version of the article in a comment.
6526,Kids too?
6527,The most frustrating part of all of this is that children still cannot get the vaccine.
6528,Meanwhile this extremely contagious variant is everywhere and our kids are still unprotected.
6529,It is unconscionable not to release the vaccine immediately for all ages.
6530,"Sorry to hear, did they have any risk factors?"
6531,Yep that's what I mean.
6532,:)))))))) You really can't win against stupidity can you?
6533,"Nah, they'll backflip out of the way."
6534,I hate insurance companies...
6535,But they need to take this and run with it to the bank in regards to anti-vaxxers
6536,One person was sitting at a outdoor cafe.
6537,“NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said preliminary advice suggested the new infection may have been transmitted through “fleeting contact” between the man and the driver.
6538,"The driver’s infection is deemed to have been “highly infectious”, as he also passed on the virus to a woman who had been sitting outside at a cafe in Vaucluse."
6539,"“This indicates that the initial case was highly infectious, as transmission must have occurred through fleeting exposure, noting that the person who caught the infection at the cafe was seated outside and there was no known on-site contact with the initial case,” Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant said.”

6540,Stay indoors and tread lightly.
6541,Fucking paywall
6542,But it’ll be a new set!
6543,Won’t that be refreshingly frustrating?
6544,I tested positive for covid today.
6545,I was vaccinated in April.
6546,Fucking miserable.
6547,Its gonna get bad guys.
6548,Had a coworker say exactly this… she is now in the hospital
6549,"As someone whose gotten the j&amp;j AND a breakthrough case 3 weeks ago, I feel sidelined."
6550,Of course there will.
6551,But now some will have to choose between their beliefs and gainful employment.
6552,Guessing many will fold on those beliefs when the rubber meets the road.
6553,Heart attacks and car accidents about to have a much lower survival rate too
6554,"It hasn’t even been two weeks, let alone one week, since Sturgis though."
6555,Actually LAUSD is mandating vaccinations for all school employees now.
6556,I know for a fact that there are many anti-vaxxers among them who will have to choose between to their job and sticking to their ideology.
6557,This is inevitably going to fuel fake vaccination cards if school districts don't have a more robust verification process.
6558,"Other problem is test results have a 24-36 hour turnaround, and they aren't requiring quarantines."
6559,Someone could be 2 days into an infection when they get tested and the results will come back negative.
6560,Don't even get me started on bad supervisors and principals that tell employees to go back to work when they've reported symptoms and are awaiting test results.
6561,There are so many cracks in the system.
6562,...not.
6563,That.
6564,"We ever did that, or anything..."
6565,what do you mean?

6568,"""The Food and Drug Administration is pushing to approve Pfizer-BioNTech’s two-dose Covid-19 vaccine on Monday, further expediting an earlier timeline for licensing the shot, according to people familiar with the agency’s planning."
6569,Regulators were working to finish the process by Friday but were still working through a substantial amount of paperwork and negotiation with the company.
6570,"The people familiar with the planning, who were not authorized to speak publicly about it, cautioned that the approval might slide beyond Monday if some components of the review need more time."
6571,An F.D.A.
6572,spokeswoman declined to comment.
6573,The agency had recently set an unofficial deadline for approval of around Labor Day.
6574,The approval is expected to pave the way for a series of vaccination requirements by public and private organizations who were awaiting firmer regulatory backing before implementing mandates.
6575,"Federal and state health officials are also hoping that an approved vaccine will draw interest from some Americans who have been hesitant to take one that was only authorized for emergency use, a phenomenon suggested by recent polling."
6576,Some universities and hospitals are expected to mandate inoculation once a vaccine is fully approved.
6577,"The Pentagon earlier this month said it plans to make Covid vaccinations mandatory for the country’s 1.3 million active-duty troops “no later” than the middle of next month, or sooner if the F.D.A."
6578,acts earlier.
6579,"The timing of the approval could result in an uncomfortable messaging problem for the Biden administration, which on Wednesday announced that fully vaccinated people should prepare to get booster shots eight months after they received second doses."
6580,Approving the vaccine and encouraging boosters at the same time may suggest to some that the vaccine as licensed is inadequate without an extra shot.
6581,The F.D.A.
6582,"last week updated its authorizations of Pfizer-BioNTech’s and Moderna’s vaccine to allow third doses for some immunocompromised people, a decision backed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."
6583,"Regulators are still reviewing Moderna’s application for full approval for its coronavirus vaccine, and a decision could come at least several weeks after the one for Pfizer-BioNTech."""
6584,Exactly!
6585,Especially the golden ticket part.
6586,It's not scientific at all and I have no idea why no one is talking about it.
6587,"I'm usually not the one to say this, but it seems like the whole vaccine passport thing isn't to just ""keep others safe and stop the spread""

A couple of months ago I would call people who said that conspiracy theorists, but honestly with what I'm seeing right now it seems like they were right about this.."
6588,Ya.
6589,Pretty much all of the cultural/political satire in the first several seasons of the show is still relevant today.
6590,"I guess it must be a combo of great writing, and the fact that things never really change in this country."
6591,"&gt;3.2 per 100,000

It's crazy how low these numbers are while people act like catching it is a death sentence."
6592,Has any consideration been given that this a breach of the employees' privacy?
6593,"I'm not going to worry until the ""rapist"" delta offshoot."
6594,Hopefully up his ___
6595,"So, epsilon next?"
6596,Each replicated virus cell holds the possibility for knocking us back a few thousand years if not extinction.
6597,Letting it burn through is not a great plan when we're all on this one rock.
6598,Do you have a source for that?
6599,Not trying to be a “SoUrCe?
6600,"?” troll, genuinely interested in reading about it."
6601,"I admit I don't have a damning scientific proof, but a couple of things to consider:

1) Delta spread like wildfire in India (unlike previous variants), which has a large poor population that live mostly outdoors."
6602,"2) Unlike with the original wild variant, we are seeing significant spread even in the Summer 'outdoor' months in Europe."
6603,"3) I'm not saying you're just as likely to spread it outdoors, far from it."
6604,"But if you're really trying to shoot for zero covid, then for example a 15-minute chat in an airless sort of outdoor environment (sheltered porch say) I'd imagine *might* be enough."
6605,Any GP should be able to order an antibody test.
6606,"Make sure it provides quantitative results, titers, not just positive/negative."
6607,There's a reason why we don't give liver transplants to alcoholics.
6608,They're going to just waste it.
6609,There's a reason we need to stop treating anti-vaxxers.
6610,They're wasting resources that could go to people who actually trust in science.
6611,“Two-week lockdown”
6612,This is great progress.
6613,However I feel like there's going to be even more excuses by the anti-vax mob now.
6614,The fact that 60% of hospitalized patients are fully vaccinated are usually explained by Israel's high vaccination rate.
6615,"So by downplaying Israel's vaccination rate and prefixing it with ""only"" for no reason at all you're essentially arguing against the vaccine."
6616,Good job.
6617,"As a vaccinated individual, I'll be enjoying my long, hot showers."
6618,"The people who ordered this need to testify before Congress, these actions are unacceptable"
6619,I'm pretty sure this isn't the same vaccine that is being used for humans.
6620,These animals are receiving a different kind of vaccine.
6621,Has there been any real enforcement?
6622,I remember at the start of the pandemic there were threats of fines for not wearing masks.
6623,Only a handful were ultimately given out.
6624,"Even businesses around the nation, from restaurants in CA to a gym in NY,  openly flaunted restrictions and were given slaps on the wrist."
6625,Let’s see where Tucker moves the goalposts now
6626,"A random number generator with values between 1 and 3....

6633,"The reason people say this is because if the carrot doesn't work, then we should use the stick (i.e."

6669,Even assaulting teachers who do wear masks.
6670,It's like not enough people in their lives have been effected by COVID or died from it.
6671,"For people saying that vaccines cause autism or insert conspiracy theory here, we don't know what it does to kids in the long run."
6672,They still have 70+ years to live with the long term effects of COVID.

6706,It could also be the strain you are using.
6707,Some work fine with me and others are just awful.
6708,I think adding the cbd/hemp to my smoke mix has made the biggest difference for me though as I think it just allowed me to more easily control how high I was getting while still taking my usual size rips lol.
6709,Plus hemp is usually cheaper than weed so it's a win/win to me.
6710,I know someone else mentioned delta 8 but I personally didn't like it.

6747,"Bears, baboons, tigers are getting COVID vaccines at zoos across the U.S.
Here’s what you should know about the experimental COVID-19 vaccine rolling out to zoo animals—and why your pets aren’t getting it."
6748,Kern the brown bear got his COVID-19 vaccine on July 21.
6749,Then he ate whipped cream straight from the can.
6750,"Along with their vaccines, the tigers got their favorite meat—beef tenderloin—on shish kebab skewers, and a spritz of goat milk in their mouths."
6751,The siamangs—big black-furred gibbons—each got a large marshmallow.
6752,The baboons: gummy fruit snacks and a (peeled) hard-boiled egg.
6753,"At the Oakland Zoo, in California, 48 animals—including hyenas, chimpanzees, and mountain lions—have received at least one dose of an experimental COVID-19 vaccine made exclusively for animals."
6754,Half are already fully vaccinated.
6755,"The Oakland Zoo is among dozens of zoos, research institutions, and sanctuaries that have requested the vaccines from veterinary pharmaceutical company Zoetis."
6756,"The requests came in the wake of news that great apes at the San Diego Zoo became the first zoo animals in the country to receive the vaccines; that was in February, as first reported by National Geographic."
6757,"“The story sparked interest from so many of the other zoos, and that’s what led to our big donation plans,” says Mahesh Kumar, senior vice president of global biologics at Zoetis, which developed the vaccine."
6758,"Those plans include fulfilling requests to send some 11,000 doses of the animal vaccine to more than 80 institutions in 27 states for free."
6759,"It’s a promising development for zoo animals, which are at risk of the disease because of their proximity to humans."
6760,But much remains unknown.
6761,How effective will the vaccines be?
6762,Will they protect animals against the Delta variant?
6763,Will the rollout be complicated by anti-vaxxers’ loud objections?
6764,And will pets ever need to be vaccinated?
6765,The scientists and institutions at the heart of the animal vaccine rollout hope to find answers in the coming months.
6766,Why vaccinate zoo animals?
6767,"Since early in the pandemic, zoo animals have contracted the virus."
6768,"First, tigers and lions at the Bronx Zoo in April 2020; later, a gorilla troop at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park."
6769,"In June 2021, two lions died at a zoo in India after testing positive for COVID-19."
6770,"“We have such a large spectrum of animals to care for, from little poison dart frogs to elephants,” says Alex Herman, vice president of veterinary services at the Oakland Zoo."
6771,"Although the Oakland Zoo hasn’t detected symptoms of COVID-19 in its animals, “we knew our animals were at risk,” Herman says."
6772,"Her staff are all fully vaccinated, but “we don’t know how severe Delta will be” or the risk of transmission to animals, she says."
6773,"“This virus originated in animals and spread to people, and we know it can be spread back to animals,” adds Nadine Lamberski, chief conservation and wildlife health officer at the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance."
6774,"In addition to wanting to keep more of the San Diego Zoo animals safe, “we wanted to do our best to interrupt that [transmission] cycle to prevent the virus from sticking around.”
Getting an experimental vaccine to zoos 
After a dog tested positive for the virus in Hong Kong in February 2020—the first reported case in a domesticated animal—Zoetis began developing a COVID-19 vaccine for dogs and cats."
6775,By October 2020 the pharmaceutical company had confidence it was safe and effective in both species.
6776,"The experimental vaccine, Kumar says, works similarly to the Novavax vaccine for humans, which is currently in large-scale efficacy tests."
6777,"Instead of using mRNA (like the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines), a viral vector (like the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine), or a live virus, it uses synthetic spike proteins to trigger the same antibodies the live virus would."
6778,The vaccines are being distributed to zoos on an experimental basis.
6779,"The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is not considering commercial approval of any vaccines for animals, with the exception of mink on fur farms where outbreaks have spread widely, Kumar says."
6780,"Prior to each shipment, Zoetis must get case-by-case approval from both the USDA and the state veterinarian where the zoo is located."
6781,"“There’s a lot of work,” says Kumar, who is overseeing 80 individual [zoo] agreements and 80 individual requests to the USDA and state veterinarians."
6782,"So far, Zoetis has completed the process for 15 zoos and sent out about 2,000 doses."
6783,"The company has received many requests from zoos and other facilities internationally, but the added logistics of navigating various countries’ regulations will be a challenge, Kumar says."
6784,"For now, they’re focused on U.S. zoos."
6785,"Deciding which animals get the vaccine
A year and a half into the pandemic, scientists still know little about how the virus affects non-human animals."
6786,Some studies have identified species that may be at heightened risk.
6787,"In many cases, the veterinary community must rely on limited data sets, learning what it can from individual clinical cases and sporadic outbreaks in a handful of species."
6788,"Both the San Diego Zoo and Oakland Zoo requested vaccines for all of their primates and carnivorans—a group of animals that includes big cats, bears, hyenas, ferrets, and mink, among others."
6789,"These animals are known to be susceptible to the virus, but aside from the deaths of the two lions in India, the majority of big cats and primates have had only minor respiratory symptoms and have made full recoveries."
6790,"At the San Diego Zoo and the San Diego Zoo Safari Park, 266 animals have received at least one dose of the vaccine."
6791,"None of the animals there or at the Oakland Zoo have shown any side effects, according to Lamberski and Herman."
6792,"Animal anti-vaxxers
After the Oakland Zoo announced plans to vaccinate some of its animals, it immediately faced backlash from anti-vaxxers on social media, by phone, and by email."
6793,Anti-vaxxer Instagram influencers with tens of thousands of followers helped amplify the attacks.
6794,"“It was such an onslaught,” says Erin Harrison, vice president of marketing and communications at the Oakland Zoo."
6795,"“Saying you’re poisoning your animals, killing your animals.” 
Many of the messages, filled with misinformation, took the fact that the vaccine is legally defined as experimental to be an indication that zoos were conducting experiments on their animals."
6796,"“Half of them said we’re going to report you to PETA,” Harrison says."
6797,"PETA, for its part, then put out a statement in support of the Oakland Zoo, noting, “These vaccines have been clinically tested and administered to animals only after deep consideration by veterinary professionals."
6798,"Since growing numbers of big cats, apes, and otters in zoos are contracting SARS-CoV-2—the virus that causes COVID-19—from asymptomatic humans, the evidence clearly indicates that the benefits of vaccination in susceptible species far outweigh the dire risks of infection for unvaccinated animals.”
The Oakland and San Diego zoos plan to do antibody testing of the vaccinated animals and share the results with the zoological community to build a database that can help determine the vaccine’s efficacy in various species."
6799,"Why zoo animals are getting COVID-19 vaccines and your pet isn't
Although dogs and cats have tested positive for COVID-19 in a smattering of cases around the world, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA) don’t recommend vaccinating pets, due to their relatively mild clinical signs and the lack of evidence that pets can transmit the virus to humans."
6800,"“It remains our opinion that there is no need for owners to consider vaccinating their pets against SARS-CoV-2 at this time,” notes WSAVA in an April 29 report."
6801,"Between zoo visitors and animal caretakers, the chances of a zoo animal getting exposed to the virus is higher, Zoetis’s Kumar says."
6802,"When compared to lions and tigers, “I wouldn’t say that [domestic] cats are less susceptible—just that the cat is getting exposed to people probably a lot less.” 
Any request to vaccinate a cat or dog would have to go through the same process as vaccine requests for zoo animals, with individual approval from the USDA and state veterinarian."
6803,"“You can imagine if we got 100,000 requests for cats and dogs."
6804,"So it’s not a practical way for us to supply it,” says Kumar."
6805,"Vaccinations for cats and dogs would depend on the government soliciting and authorizing broad commercial use, he says."
6806,"The USDA is currently only accepting applications for animal COVID-19 vaccines for mink, so unless that changes, the Zoetis vaccine will only be available for other species on an experimental, case-by-case basis."
6807,"“The best way to prevent [COVID-19] in dogs and cats is not to let their people become infected,” says Lappin."
6808,"In other words, Kumar says to pet owners, “vaccinate yourself.”

6812,Long covid isn't one thing.
6813,It's basically what covid hits hard in you.
6814,"Could be lung damage, could be blood clots, could be brain damage."
6815,Long covid is not a thing.
6816,"Well, back to staying in ony days off and ordering stuff online."
6817,"Wait, I've been doing that for the last year and a half."
6818,"I agree with you, but vaccines only halve the risk of long covid, according to the most recent study I saw."
6819,So saying that case numbers don't matter doesn't account for this.
6820,"To me, having months or permanent chronic fatigue, brain fog, and other issues qualifies as severely ill as well if it interferes with your ability to live your life and go to work."
6821,"&gt; Just leave me alone

Sure, just stop exhaling"
6822,The vaccinated have predicted this for months.
6823,Many people have
6824,It's quite common.
6825,There's been a recent resurgence in other respiratory viruses recently which were being held-back by Covid mitigation measures.
6826,Immunity Debt is a real phenomenon.
6827,This seems unfounded
6828,I am not.
6829,A lot of people I know have been getting sick with colds and negative COVID tests.
6830,Maybe the tests are wrong?
6831,"Whatever it is, it sounds like you are fighting it off."
6832,I hope you keep getting better!
6833,:)
6834,"Including Cuba, who spends like a tenth of the US per person."
6835,Vaxxed and puffing on that Indica wax.
6836,I’m not sure what they mean by brain zaps.
6837,I was on 225mg of Effexor before I got pregnant.
6838,I tapered down then went completely off meds.
6839,I was off for about a year or so and now I’m back on.. but at a lower dose
6840,I'm probably older than you are.
6841,"Pretty soon they're going to run out of ""out-of-state"" states from whom to request doctors."
6842,I think a major part of the climate change conversation has to be adaption.
6843,Part of that adaptation is knowing that at lest half the population could care less and may actively do harm on purpose.
6844,Arkansas curve has turned.
6845,The reality is people do change their private behavior when they start to know people who are sick.
6846,We saw it before in the south and Texas that enough people are sick quick enough and people change behavior without mandates etc.
6847,there was a report earlier spending in hospitality is down in Florida meaning tourism and eating out have reduced probably due to all the bad covid press.
6848,But that also reduces the spread.
6849,Do not get a third dose if you aren't immuncompromised.
6850,We don't have guidance on that yet and it's really pointless.
6851,As if we needed more evidence that the US and its healthcare system are both dogshit.
6852,Yep yep.
6853,V&amp;Z gang here.
6854,I’ve said it before and will say it again but Reddit’s demographic is skewed in favor of being a shut in.
6855,I saw the comment you were talking about and couldn’t roll my eyes enough
6856,Exactly this.
6857,Husband and I just turned 36.
6858,I didn't want to wait any later due to other high-risk factors.
6859,We had always planned to conceive by 35 and have a baby by 36.
6860,Then the pandemic happened.
6861,Time was limited so we just went with it.
6862,And now we have a beautiful baby boy.
6863,"Sorry, not sorry."
6864,Then why do I keep reading about how you shouldn't go past the two drinks or risk your immune system getting unsafely compromised?
6865,"Although I don't know about specifics, there has also been talk about patients being flown out-of-state and filling up hospitals all over."
6866,So I assume some of them aren't even from Oregon.
6867,Buy clearance masks while you can

6869,Those plans are locked to the job based insurance.
6870,"If you are self employed, you have no such options, period."
6871,Why are all the libs in NYC not taking the shot?
6872,Why can't Portland just refuse to take them?
6873,People in a highly vaccinated area shouldn't have to suffer because of unvaxxed morons from hundreds of miles away.
6874,"If you choose to not get vaccinated, and you choose to not take any precautions, and you choose to live in a rural area nowhere near a good hospital, you should deal with the consequences of your choices."
6875,What a fucking tool.
6876,Vaccines stop you from becoming severally ill.
6877,"It does not matter about case numbers, as long as people are vaccinated."
6878,"Cause guess what, everyones getting covid at somepoint, and as long as you have the shot, you're good."
6879,"also a lot of israel's antivaxxers are concentrated in the haredi community, its a similar reason to why cases are exploding in USA's ""bible belt"""
6880,Yes but since those with the vaccine are more likely to eradicate the virus quickly it gives the virus less of a chance to infect someone else.
6881,"The fact that only 1 out of 100,000 people have died from it also isn't going to convince them."
6882,"They'll ignore what ""hospitalization"" actually means or that many non-hospitalized people deal with effects of the disease for months."

6890,Should I start worrying now?
6891,I currently take the max amount allowed without an OD....
6892,"Not just conservatives who haven't been getting the vaccine,  hate to break it to you."
6893,Could they do what that district in Texas did and make it part of the dress code?
6894,Do people truly not know nor care what the vaccines are for?
6895,"They are to stop severe sickness, hospitalization, and death."
6896,"Which they do, ten fold."
6897,"And for young people, its even more so."
6898,"Every human on earth will have covid enter their body, but that doesn't mean it will become a disease, because of the vaccine."
6899,"Rice is showing they are caving to peer pressure from loud outside voices, instead of actually going with what vaccines do, which is stop sickness."
6900,It's sad to see this.
6901,"Yeah, that seems kind of bullshit that they made you decide months ago when everything just changed."
6902,[deleted]
6903,Some have been saying to expect larger number of breakthrough cases as the vaccination rate increases.
6904,"All kinds of outdoor events are happening where I live, and the common opinion is ""outdoors is safe, we don't need masks""."
6905,"Which is fine, but when crowds are literally shoulder to shoulder in places?"
6906,Is it really safe?
6907,"Also just because the fairs, festivals, carnivals, bazaars, etc... are mostly outdoors, there are enclosed spaces."
6908,"Large restroom buildings, enclosed eating/drinking spaces, enclosed exhibition buildings and entertainment venues."
6909,And then loads of people go to local businesses on the way to and from.
6910,They're not wearing masks into gas stations and restaurants and convenience stores.
6911,Are you immunocompromised?
6912,"If not, don't get a third dose."

6916,"&gt;You left out the part of america that are vaccinated, and don’t give a shit what happens to people that chose not to be vaccinated."
6917,"Oh look, that's me!"
6918,This is a strong case for universal testing versus the punitive testing model that a lot of US jurisdictions are rolling out.
6919,I'm vaccinated and would personally rather sit next to an unvaccinated person who just had a negative COVID test than a vaccinated person who hasn't been tested at all.
6920,Life is too short to read posts from stupid people.
6921,"I'm in the harley community, and lots of my pals (I use the term loosely, it's through work) ride Sturgis."
6922,"Zero of them are vaccinated, all of them go on rants about freedom and masks and slippery slopes."
6923,Do you know how you contracted it?
6924,&gt; We also must remember that it’s not advantageous for the virus to become as highly transmissible as it is because eventually it will burn through the entire population and run out of hosts.
6925,I'm glad somebody can see the big picture.
6926,"""entire population"" is a bit of a stretch, but anything that takes out 10% or 20% could seriously set us back, as many of those individuals might be key to keeping society functioning."
6927,"Eventually things stop working, and we revert to sailing ships, and sealing wax, and cabbages, and kings."
6928,And what are they doing about vaccines?
6929,Nothing?
6930,"Just saying put on a mask, but sit at a bar?"
6931,"As always, its a political ploy that has no real consequence."
6932,Isn't that what dogs do with every new person they come across?
6933,No.
6934,"With the initial variants, 95% of people developed symptoms within 5 days."
6935,Not sure about these latest variants.
6936,They’re more virulent so I assume it’ll be around the same
6937,how about anyone else getting a terrible cold/respiratory infection for WEEKS??
6938,"It’s hit me, my mom and brother."
6939,The first week for all of us wasnt terrible at all.
6940,Then around day 8-10 friggin slammed with a cough.
6941,non productive for a while and now finally hacking up mucus.
6942,I’m on day 28 and finally feeling close to normal.
6943,"I took 2 PCR self administered tests a few days into my symptoms, both negative."
6944,"Mom a rapid test 1 week in, negative."
6945,Really quite sure it isnt covid but damn it’s doing a number on all of us.
6946,Good old machismo.
6947,"And take the chance of looking like a ""weenie"" in front of their peers?"
6948,LOL they'd rather be proudly anti-vax.
6949,&gt;The pandemic has reinforced countries’ peculiar currents of national identity.
6950,"In Australia, it’s a collectivist urge, sometimes at the expense of personal liberty."
6951,I'm in Alabama and gravely concerned that any thing which might send a loved one to the hospital could be fatal.
6952,"We're all vaccinated, but the hospitals are crammed full."
6953,People are going to be dying in the parking lots.
6954,"Vaccinated people aren't responsible for the rise of Delta, no matter how much you want them to be."
6955,"Even so, most vaccinated people are still wearing masks in most public places and at the very least aren't going to pitch a fit if someone asks them to wear a mask."
6956,"If you want to cut down on spread in any major way, you have to start with the unvaccinated."
6957,It's free.
6958,What's their logic?
6959,They are.
6960,Several companies will be taking this work from home advantage by laying off American workers and paying overseas workers 1/3 of your salary.
6961,"If your job can be done remotely from anywhere, then they no longer need it to be done here."
6962,A company I consult for is already making plans to lay off 10-15% of the workforce and take it to India over the next couple of years.
6963,These people will gladly take your job and won't complain about 12 hour workdays.
6964,I agree that you are likely correct in your assumptions.
6965,You need to see a psychiatrist.
6966,Leronlimab from the company Cytodyn.com uses the natural immunity in the body to fight covid.
6967,It should be coming soon.
6968,We've already got a renewed mask mandate in Nevada.
6969,And we aren't close to the most liberal state in the US.
6970,Agreed.
6971,"I understand some people, myself included, are more productive in the office, but it’s not worth the monetary and mental health expense of the extra 10 hours a week in driving, wear and tear on my car, and just being away from home for 40 hours a week."

6979,"Something along the lines of ""No Students Left Without COVID""."
6980,It even has a familiar ring to it!
6981,a lot of areas in the US didn't even have elecrricty yet.
6982,only about a third of homes did.
6983,also you should take time off strenuous exercising for the first couple weeks after getting vaccinated but not a lot of people preach that
6984,"This year, yep."
6985,Huge bummer.
6986,"I had really wanted/expected to go back to the fair this year, but it just wasn't in the cards."
6987,"If they had a vax requirement, I would 100% go."

6997,Yeah like drive a car…
6998,Keep worrying - nobody is going to stop you from wearing your mask in perpetuity.
6999,Just trying to explain that there is always a base layer of risk by living in a world with people.
7000,Satan told him to try to kill people.
7001,"Pretty unfortunate that many hard-core Christians won't listen to God who's telling us all to get vaccinated (I mean, that's what He told me)."
7002,We should have been turning them away at the border.
7003,No vaccine is 100% effective.
7004,Because of that there is a portion of the vaccinated population that will get infected and have poorer outcomes.
7005,Moderna and Pfizer do have a 95% effective rate but what is that 95% for?
7006,It means that you have a much better chance at not being hospitalized or dying....not that you won't be infected by COVID and have to fight it off.
7007,Fully vaccinated patient above sounds like she got the monoclonal treatment in the emergency room and was not hospitalized and obviously didn't die.
7008,The vaccine did its job....hooray!!
7009,She was doing poorly because this virus is a BEAST.
7010,"So...unvaccinated people have to do battle with the virus, like an average person going into the ring with Muhammed Ali."
7011,Not good odds....but still possible you will survive although there will be many that don't.
7012,Getting vaccinated means you can go into the ring with some brass knuckles in your gloves against Muhammed Ali.
7013,You are still going to have a fight on your hands...for some they will have a lessor fight and others will still have a helluva fight.
7014,"A few will still perish, a large chunk will still get brutally pummeled but will survive, and some will be able to knock Ali out with one lucky punch."
7015,See there is a range of possibilities that can happen to you when you are vaccinated.
7016,"It is a wide range ...from death on one end....to being completely unfazed by the virus on the other end, with a much higher percentage on the side of the range that is not serious or severe."
7017,"Unvaccinated people too have a range which goes from death on one side to feeling kind of crummy....however, there is a higher percentage of people in this range that are leaning toward more severe disease, hospitalization, and death."
7018,Pharm.D here.
7019,"Ah yes, won't someone please think of the poor companies that exist to profit off our pain and suffering?"
7020,&gt;the situation will be much better by Christmas.
7021,"Oh, you mean when the R of respiratory diseases dramatically increases?"
7022,"Man, I used to love being high."
7023,I’d wake up with the bong and stay high throughout the day and it was great.
7024,Then I stopped completely for a while because of a job and now I just take a single solitary toke at night before sleep and I get all sorts of anxiety.
7025,"Idk why I even do it anymore really, I guess just out of routine or habit."
7026,Do you have any recommendations for using it to help with anxiety instead of exacerbating it?
7027,These people are so childish and delusional they don't believe that covid is real *even when they themselves are dying from it*.
7028,What do we do with that?
7029,How can we work together with these people?
7030,We can't.
7031,I have no idea where we go from here other than just letting the bodies pile up.
7032,"If everyone would listen and just wear a mask,  the vaccinated wouldn't be spreading it to the unvaccinated."
7033,I'll take a sniffle over a ventilator anyway.
7034,"If anyone is catching this disease that could have the chance vaccine, you have nobody to blame but yourself."
7035,Decisions have consequences.
7036,"Get vaccinated and wear your mask,  I really don't want to see you die."
7037,The fact that many states are not making it easy to get tested also contributes to this dilemma.
7038,This is the same nonsense we were dealing with last year.
7039,The CDC has had issues with testing since they refused tests from Germany back in February 2020 in favor of American-made ones that got botched and set us back several months.
7040,"Yeah, for whatever reason the buses fall under the federal requirements for public transportation which mandate masks."

7188,And that's what happened with Delta and Lambda.
7189,"Lambda was discovered earlier (and named C.37 at the time) than Delta (original name B.1.617.2), but since B.1.617.2 caused so much more trouble, it got the Variant of Concern label and Greek-letter-name (Delta) before C.37 was named Variant of Interest (which is a ""lower"" ranking as well) and Lambda."

7220,"Yet we aren't even sure how widespread ""long covid"" is, and under the ""long covid"" umbrella we also include people having some mild fatigue for a couple months."
7221,I'd be confident we can rule out that kind of effects you're talking about.

7348,It takes 600 of them more than normal to “overload” the entire the countries ICU.
7349,Take a step back and think that through.
7350,"When you are determining risk for something, laughing at someone and saying HERE YOU GO ICU BEDS ARE NEAR THE BRINK IN THIS AREA, does not correspond to the reality that by this metric 52 of the ~5.3 million kids in Texas are in the ICU above normal."
7351,"Are you aware that by your numbers and doing some rounding it would take 5 children in the state of Mississippi to “overload the system”, and that is assuming that they have the average amount of beds per child that you provided, which i probably doubt."
7352,"Not to mention the risk goes up exponentially by age, so even between 1-10 and 11-20 there is a big difference."

7390,[Dr. Carl Bergstrom has an explainer on herd immunity.
7391,](https://twitter.com/CT_Bergstrom/status/1378741102476337155?s=20) It's the immunity level where *new* outbreaks can't get a foothold.
7392,"Unfortunately, it is doesn't mean *ongoing* outbreaks will suddenly stop."
7393,The booster shots are pretty controversial now because the WHO would prefer rich countries to give their doses to poorer countries rather than use them to maximise their population's protection
7394,I guess its just a huge feeling of anxiety and worrying we will go back into the winter’s restrictions and lifestyle.
7395,I have a job that I can’t really do remotely and was laid off for well over a year.
7396,"I’ve had some of the absolute worst moments of my life since this all started and just want to feel like there’s some forward progress, if that makes sense."
7397,My family is also super strict about this and was already discussing we probably won’t have any in person holidays this year again.
7398,I was barely able to see them since 2019.
7399,Idk man just all feels defeating sometimes.
7400,Gotta catch 'em all!

7405,To be sensible in America is to wade through horse shit up to your elbows
7406,Good point.
7407,&gt;More immunity evading is likely if not inevitable as that's just how viruses evolve.
7408,Hoping for that to happen in a long long future so it may not turn our vaccines useless.
7409,"Although some specialists already said that is unlikely to happen, even as possible (but anything is possible in reality, which turns this point kinda vague)."
7410,They think the vaccine is in Revelations and that it's the mark of the beast.
7411,Which is bizarre because the mark of the beast was supposed to be on your hand or forehead and I was never even offered the chance to get the shot smack in the middle of my forehead.

7416,"If you’re separating religions on whether nor not you personally think they’re good faith, then doing it wrong."
7417,That’s one can of worms to open up and a power I do not want the government to have.
7418,"Religious exemptions are fine, as long as the rest of us can “reasonably accommodate” that exemption."

7420,Here’s your desk you can fill out the rest of your career.”
7421,"That's good, i'm double vaccinated and still picked up a mild case of Covid."
7422,We'll almost certainly reach the endemic point by next spring.
7423,The only question is how many empty vials of vaccine and how many body bags.
7424,"Also technically R0 is a constant, the original R. The R that changes is Rt, R at a time point; Re, effective R; or just R."

7436,"Anyway - at first when I tried this I thought it was going to be too small and not work, but it does work!"
7437,I just wouldn't use these types of masks alone.
7438,They don't do that much.
7439,"I mean, they are better than nothing... but they are not great."
7440,"So if you use them, put something like a good three-layer tightly-woven cotton mask over them, in addition to this."
7441,In my opinion all efforts should be focused on the masking and not vaccinating.
7442,"You alienate many different demographics by forcing vaccine mandates and to me, it is not a winnable battle."
7443,I believe the fallout over such attempts could create a situation that is even worse in fact.
7444,"To start I really hope I didn't come off as an anti-vaxer, I am fully vaccinated and I'm eagerly awaiting my booster shot this fall."
7445,With that being said from the reports I've read it appears that with the Delta variant a vaccinated individual is more likely to experience a breakthrough case and become contagious than with the alpha variant.
7446,I in no way was trying to imply that vaccines aren't effective or shouldn't be taken.
7447,I'm in total agreement with pretty much everything you said.
7448,thx

7459,"Back in the spring when cases were falling to record lows since the start of the pandemic, I just had a gut feeling that it was too good to be true; that there *had* to be a catch somewhere."
7460,"This is especially considering last summer we thought cases would decline from the initial surge in the spring, only to see cases climb back up in the summer, as well as how the virus is just really unpredictable."
7461,"I started seeing this possibility on the horizon when the UK, which is one of the highest vaxxed countries, still saw a Delta surge."
7462,"Knowing they’re even more well-vaxxed than the US, I knew that trouble was on the horizon."

7477,But this can be fixed with proper investment.
7478,Those people who are immunocompromised and those who can't have the vaccine have my sympathy.
7479,Society can't lock down for them and they've been dealt a shit hand.
7480,"For those who refuse the vaccine we just need to minimise their cost to society by making them pay extra for their covid treatment and excluding them from football matches, concerts, nightclubs etc."

7504,"its *very* important that people recognize these vaccines were not designed to reduce transmissibility- they're designed to reduce the severity of symptoms, and those different target endpoints mean you are still very susceptible to covid, even if you're vaccinated."
7505,This was the priority because this pandemic is a global dumpster fire and we had NO TOOLS to fight this thing.
7506,"Later vaccines may be better at reducing transmission, but for now, dont assume that the vaccine protects you from COVID- it doesnt."
7507,It makes it less likely you die or wind up in the hospital.
7508,"Anecdotally, there are *lots* of reports of vaccinated COVID survivors who, even without needing the hospital, are having chronic challenges several months after infection."
7509,"Yes, the vaccine does provide real protection, and everyone should have one."

7583,"It's an immune response in a bottle, specific to a disease."
7584,MAb therapy provides the antibodies that your body would otherwise make given time (or given vaccination).
7585,It doesn't create an immune response.

7663,"In doing this, your immune system has to develop the type of immune cells that make antibodies."
7664,These cells stick around in low-ish numbers and can be ready to produce more antibodies in the future if you are ever exposed to that antigen again.
7665,The monoclonal antibody treatment is literally antibodies collected from the blood of people who have the antibodies.
7666,"Your body will not be able to replicate those antibodies, although if you are infected, it will be making its own."
7667,"However, adding extra antibodies in when someone is at the beginning of an infection will allow the body to attack the virus much more quickly because the unvaccinated patient would not have had enough time to make their own."

7697,It's hard to imagine that the people of Florida don't see DeSantis as doing more harm than good at this point.

7714,I think a lot of it is also location.
7715,"If you're somewhere with strong vaccine uptake and low virus spread, it could elicit a less cautious response than say pretty much the entire southeast part of the US right now."
7716,"I'm vaccinated but if I was in Florida, Louisiana, etc, no way would I go out and do stuff."
7717,"But I'm in DC, which while is still seeing a surge, isn't anywhere near that level, especially in the surrounding areas in MD and VA, so I'm willing to go do more things."

7721,They’re two very different things.
7722,Monoclonal antibody cocktails are like laser guided missiles.
7723,They can get used up for every hit on a virus.
7724,A vaccine is more a stimulant that can teach a nation state to attack it and create their own laser guided missiles….along with other methods of destroying the virus.
7725,Monoclonal antibodies get exhausted.
7726,Nation states are more hardy and can ramp up destruction potential.

7746,&gt;Yet a leading medical ethicist who studies how COVID-19 affects communities says he worries that adding vaccination status to the triage of patients will unfairly harm low-income people and people of color.

7755,That surely wouldn’t make sense.
7756,Has there been any talk about lifting the mask mandates once cases come down further?
7757,"It will be interesting to see if places drop them once you have spent a couple weeks below the CDC's 50 cases/week/100,000 people threshold (which is when I think they should drop the mandates)."

7782,Too many ignorant of medicine insulting me and rationalizing dehumanizing people.
7783,I think you were rightfully lambasted by completely missing the point of the post.
7784,"In our cardiac cath lab, we don’t provide care for people that have strict AND forms because starting a procedure that has a fairly realistic chance of going directly to the morgue because you can’t provide basic life support, is a gross waste of finite resources, but it doesn’t mean that the interventional radiologists or electrophysiologists are mocking or ridiculing people that don’t want defibrillation or CPR."
7785,We have months of data that show that people that are unvaccinated have a much lower chance of surviving severe covid.

7788,"People should just continue to rat out the Texas Attorney General, corrupt official."

7790,That’s not what your link says.
7791,"&gt; Among states reporting, children were 0.00%-0.25% of all COVID-19 deaths, and 7 states reported zero child deaths

So .25 seems too high to project it nationwide."
7792,"The problem isn't the number of shots, it's distribution and storage."
7793,If we can all agree on that last paragraph I think our country will be just fine.
7794,Delta+ is shorthand for multiple different sub-variants of delta.
7795,Most of them appear less contagious than standard delta.
7796,"The AY3 variant is the most concerning of the delta+ variants, but it doesn’t appear any worse than OG delta"
7797,r/nottheonion
7798,These make sense.
7799,"If true though, I’m confused as to why we are going for a 3rd V1.0 vaccine as a booster rather than a 2.0 version more targeted to delta?"
7800,It's not bleak at all.
7801,The first two shots do an excellent job at preventing severe disease leading to hospitalization and death.
7802,"If everyone were fully vaccinated, hospitals would not have an issue."
7803,"Right now in Israel, roughly [60%](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/public-health/nearly-60-of-hospitalized-covid-19-patients-in-israel-fully-vaccinated-study-finds.html) of hospitalized covid patients are fully vaccinated (two shots)."
7804,Hospitalizations are at [60%](https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/countries-and-territories/israel/) of their previous peak.
7805,So the vaccinated people in the hospital would be 36% of the previous peak--pretty good in the middle of a massive wave that is certainly going to eventually recede.
7806,"
This isn't a normal circumstance, regardless."
7807,ICUs are full.
7808,There's no room for new patients.
7809,So you have to start picking and choosing.

7816,Nobody is rationalizing this.
7817,They're accepting that it has to happen.
7818,My fear hear is that the need for boosters may be coming more from deep pockets wanting to get deeper than science showing they are needed.
7819,Going to be interesting to see what independent scientific review of the data says.
7820,"I will get one if proper research says its needed - but this from the article makes me think the administration's announcement may be a bit premature:

&amp;#x200B;

""Other experts said the U.S. plan requires thorough vetting by the FDA and a panel of outside advisers to the CDC."
7821,"A meeting of those advisers to discuss boosters set for Aug. 24 is being rescheduled, the CDC said on Thursday on its website."""

7834,AZ is not a traditional vaccine.
7835,Its uses a harmless adenovirus to deliver a DNA payload that's transcribed into mRNA that makes the SARS-COV-2  spike protein that elicits   a immune response.
7836,very similar  to how that the mRNA vaccines work  but with added steps.
7837,Both are vaccines platforms the you u can quickly change the genetic sequence in the payload to what ever viral proteins you wish to be produced.
7838,Both technology's have been in development  for a decade.
7839,"Both went through the same trial process last year   
Both had greater then 15k people in the phase 3 trials."

1) Israel's doing a lot more testing."
7894,[It's doing over 20 tests per confirmed case while the US is doing about 7](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus/country/israel).
7895,"So even though cases have increased significantly there, raw case counts probably understate the US case growth relative to Israel's

2) If it's true that Pfizer immunity wanes with time (not 100% established but seems like evidence is pointing that way), the fact Israel had super early vaccinations is probably a factor too"

7917,"But unfortunately when we are out of resources, which happened during the other wave peaks, doctors have to decide who to give them to."
7918,It goes based on survival rates.
7919,Prior to the vaccine healthier younger patients were picked.
7920,This criteria is going by the facts.
7921,People who get the vaccine have a higher chance of survival than people who don't.
7922,Which would put them higher on the survival lists when those decisions need to start being made again.
7923,It's not just vaxed or not.
7924,It takes all factors including vax status into deciding survivability.

7943,One or two anecdotes are just that.
7944,"A child death is a goddamn tragedy, but we don't make policy decisions on anecdotes."
7945,Zero deaths is not an achievable or reasonable goal.
7946,Did we ban children from riding in cars when a child died in a car accident?
7947,"The fact that it's a newspaper article suggests that it wasn't common, in fact."
7948,"If  those cases are so common, how many excess deaths were there among children in 2020?"
7949,I'll help you.
7950,None.
7951,Children had a lower rate of death and illness in 2020 compared to previous years.
7952,Adults had a significant increase in deaths compared to previous years.
7953,There were 188 pediatric flu deaths in the 2017/18 flu season.
7954,"And that's flu alone, not counting rsv and other deaths of unknown viral origin."
7955,"RSV alone hospitalizes 58,000 children in the US per year."
7956,None of those deaths were considered newsworthy before.
7957,"I'm telling you the actual stats on how many kids under 12 have died from covid, and the answer is hardly any."
7958,"If you have *stats* that say otherwise, feel free to share them."
7959,Where do you see the R for your state?
7960,I think it's a mistake to start giving boosters while much of the world doesn't have even the first shot.
7961,Being selfish isn't going to help...
7962,Sounds good to me.
7963,Isn't this effectively just a unique triage rule?
7964,"Like the person with the vaccine, even if in slightly worse shape, is more likely to survive than the unvaccinated person, thus in a triage situation you should take that into account."
7965,Seems like this is just making that clear.
7966,Neither of you read the article fully did you?
7967,&gt;“COVID-19 vaccination decreases severe infection and death.
7968,"Vaccine status therefore may be considered when making triage decisions as part of the physician’s assessment of each individual’s likelihood of survival.”

&gt;Fine said, “This does not move a COVID-19 patient to the back of the line."
7969,"It is one of many factors that may be considered, and we want it considered based not upon somebody being angry at the unvaccinated subconsciously."
7970,"We want it considered on an objective basis.” That basis is, what is the likelihood of survival?"
7971,They're using vaccination status as a way to inform them of who is more likely to survive.
7972,It's one factor of many.
7973,It's complicated and nuanced.
7974,Read the damn article before you get mad.
7975,I think its 90-95% for herd immunity with delta but please do not quote me on that.
7976,"Unfortunately, that makes it basically impossible unless children are vaccinated"
7977,Question.
7978,"So,once you become a doctor, and you run out of room for patients, what will you do?"
7979,"Will you start turning away all patients that walk in, or will you look at what you already have, and start prioritizing in a way to save those people that haven't put themselves in this situation?"
7980,I'm genuinely curious.

8022,"&gt; One thing that would help, is to direct some of that infrastructure money to building (much needed) rural hospitals."
8023,There are places across the Florida panhandle that are a 50-60 mile ride to the nearest hospital.
8024,"Here (Alabama), at least, the problem isn't finding the money to build them."
8025,It's keeping them open after they are built.
8026,Rural hospitals that already exist are closing.

8039,"This already happens in medicine anyways, pandemic or not."
8040,All viruses eventually become semi-benign.
8041,"That process is: all humans that are highly susceptible are more likely to die early, and are less likely to procreate."
8042,All humans with innate resistance are more likely to procreate more before dying.
8043,"Repeat for hundreds or thousands of generations of humans, and eventually the virus is tamed."
8044,Covid may just mutate too quickly to solve through herd immunity or vaccination.

8063,"Delta will not kill more people than the previous Winter, Delta *will* take up valuable ICU space as things are ""returning to normal"" thus stalling people who need to get into ICU's for non-Delta injuries/illness."
8064,That could have a higher effect on mortality cases as a whole.
8065,Normal healthy children usually range from 97-100%.
8066,"Infants range is a bit more broad, 90-100%."
8067,You should watch for trends.
8068,Was it at/about 96% and now hovering around 92%?
8069,The downward trend is concerning.
8070,"If it is sustained at/around 90-92% and certainly if it’s below 90%, they need supplemental oxygen."

8097,"I think the bigger problem is when they made a scientifically and factually correct statement like using ""the data suggests..."" And ""it is possible..."" And then the media just ran with it and twists the headline to generate the most clicks and that caused mass confusion."
8098,"At this point, you either control what the media can publish or the CDC just shuts up."
8099,"And in the case of shutting up, the media will run with that too and go with ""experts"" or ""according to a Twitter post""."

8112,"When the lack of resources has to be taken into consideration like prioritizing ICU beds as an example, you're going to want to defer to the patient who has the higher chance of surviving."
8113,The unfortunate reality of it is that typically means going for the vaccinated over the unvaccinated patient

8127,"Not all antibodies actually neutralize the virus, and antibody tests aren't able to discern the level of neutralizing antibodies (need a serious lab for this), so regular antibody tests can't tell you if you're still protected or not."
8128,Also just for fun I just did some back of the napkin math to get a more realistic Israel picture.
8129,"According to 2019 numbers there were about 9,000,000 people in Israel."
8130,So far about 69% of the total population is vaccinated (78% 12+).
8131,"So far that leaves about 2,790,000 vulnerable."
8132,"There have been 962,193 infections in Israel."
8133,"If I make a crazy assumption and say they were all unvaccinated, that would leave 1,827,807 vulnerable Israelis."
8134,"If 5,000 people in Israel were infected every single day for the next year, that’s how long it would take for all of those remaining vulnerable to be infected and gain some modicum of immunity."
8135,Maybe it’s all just a lack of awareness of just how large our global populations are these days.
8136,"When we hear 78% of adults vaccinated in Israel we almost hear in our minds “that’s it, reached almost everybody, pandemic over”."
8137,"But even at that high rate in a country with less than 10m people, that leaves a LOT of vulnerable people."

8150,"There are plenty of articles and studies that asked, and in part answered the question:

* some areas of South Africa had good public health policy, and didn’t politicize things like wearing a mask
* there is reason to believe in poorer countries that didn’t have the testing capabilities that deaths may be under reported
* younger age of the population as a whole, compared to place such as Italy
* In poorer slums, they may have a stronger immune system becuase they are subjected to more pathogens on a daily basis
* live in a warmer climate where they are outside more, especially in the poorer areas where they aren’t locking themselves inside air conditioned buildings."
8151,"The list goes on, but I don’t suspect you actually *care* about the answer."

8180,And I fully understand it's done that way to get people to vaccinate.
8181,But there's a fine line between that and full honesty in my opinion.
8182,Seems like an indication that medical examiners are so slammed right now that they don’t have time for reporting.

8209,In Florida there are anecdotal reports of people home testing positive and not reporting their results.
8210,This has me thinking this tactic is quite pervasive now.

&gt;While the epi-trends are not very clear, the number of genomes of AY.3 seem to be increasing faster than Delta B.1.617.2 ."
8323,"This could be potentially due to cluster testing also, but surely needs epi data to confirm."

8337,What’s sad is that you’re trying to post about things like this with articles about a virus written by someone with a PhD in Polymer Chemistry and Engineering.
8338,Not a medical doctor of any kind.
8339,This is where your getting your great medical facts from and don’t understand why people do not agree with your statements.
8340,Just watched some YouTubers who all got Covid but didn’t get properly tested.
8341,One of them had it bad enough that their nurse friend had to give him oxygen at home.
8342,Seeing all of them be so flippant and not get properly tested made me realize that Florida’s numbers are so much higher than what’s actually being reported.
8343,India alone accounts for over 17% of the entire human population.
8344,Many people in need of organs are not added to waiting lists because of 'behavioral' issues - including untreated substance abuse disorder or mental illness.
8345,"Like ICU beds are currently, donor organs are in short supply."
8346,They are allocated to people who appear to be most likely to manage their health in ways that give the transplant the greatest chance of success.

8349,"Fucking idiots who cant comprehend in a population of 8b, 99.99 percent still = deaths."
8350,Yea I remember the story about a man just dropping while walking somewhere.
8351,Was speculated it was massive organ failure.
8352,100% conspiracy theorists would have called it an assassination covered up and labeled as covid.
8353,"You can also make the travel if you’re married to an American, if anyone is wondering"
8354,I saw this downvoted.
8355,"Do you (the downvoters) seriously think a fully vaccinated and extremely ill person with low survival chances should get priority over, say, a naive and unsure unvaxxed 18 year old who has been heavily influenced/brainwashed by their crazy parents whom they trust, and is not as sick?"
8356,"Or what about a woman trapped in a severely abusive relationship who cannot escape and whose husband threatens to beat and torture her if she gets vaccinated (think of those extremists if you're not sure who would do this), but she's also less sick than the incredibly ill fully vaxxed person?"
8357,(Think about how hard it would be to fully lie knowing if you're caught he might kill you... not so easy to just walk out and get vaxxed and lie to your abuser's face when any hint of you lying might result in being beaten to death).
8358,"There are some really complicated and probably not super rare situations that people are NOT considering for some of the unvaxxed, which I don't think we should pretend don't exist, and which is why we can't make absolute rules of denying care based on vaccination status alone."
8359,"This is not the same situation as denying alcoholics liver transplants, because last I heard it's not semi common for naive young adults or violently abused women to be convinced or forced to binge drink until liver failure."
8360,cool
8361,"Lol, data."
8362,"They don't just need PR classes, they need to learn what public health actually is ( a few state labs could teach them)."

8369,You have been banned for questioning the narrative.
8370,Have a good day
8371,"There's a hardline between refusing to provide care, and performing triage."
8372,"In an ideal world, triage never means someone doesn't receive life saving care."
8373,"In the real world, COVID is one long Mass Casualty Incident."
8374,We have limited personnel and resources.
8375,We have to maximize the effective use of what resources we have to save as many lives as we can.
8376,"If that means  prioritizing trauma patients or vaccinated COVID patients to increase turnover on ICU beds, versus letting an unvaccinated patient with a poor prognosis linger on a ventilator for 3 weeks, then we do it because it does the least amount of harm."
8377,I get wanting to save everyone.
8378,But you can't.
8379,Wanting everyone to get the maximum care is a great trait for a physician under normal circumstances - not a critical care physician in the midst of an MCI.
8380,&gt; For some of the technical expertise workers need to have it could take two years or more to complete education and training.
8381,That seems speculative and pessimistic.
8382,Countries like India were making vaccines before Covid with non-RNA tech.
8383,The USA scaled up production of RNA vaccines in less than a year.
8384,"At the rate we're going, there will be shortages of RNA vaccines for many years."
8385,RNA vaccine tech is applicable to diseases other than Covid.
8386,"The sooner the tech and expertise is transferred the better, but the profit motive is keeping that from happening."
8387,"This picture was taken in a library, so we don't know how sick the husband is or if he would be sick enough to be hospitalized."
8388,"These people are seeking monoclonal treatment, which apparently you can get without a prescription or referral in Florida."
8389,It says this in the article.
8390,"Also, we do know that some patients admitted to hospitals were vaccinated and still got sick."
8391,It's just that most of the very sick and dying people are unvaccinated.
8392,Hippies.
8393,I was going to go with just Eugene...
8394,One more.
8395,"Clinically, realistically, whatever u want to say."
8396,Most covid cases are mild.
8397,Most breakthru cases are mild.
8398,"Prevalence of mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19 cases
The latest research indicates that the vast majority of COVID-19 cases fall into the least severe category:

Mild to moderate: 81%
Severe: 14%
Critical: 5%


https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762130"
8399,"Absolutely..  with headlines coming out of almost every state of ICUs being overrun, children hospitalized at record rates, critical shortage of staff and facilities etc you’d expect wall to wall coverage."

8402,"I asked for, and received an albutetol inhaler when I had covid in February this year."
8403,"I have also had good luck with them when I’ve had bronchitis in the past, and covid felt a lot like bronchitis to me."
8404,Agreed about 1000%
8405,"&gt; &gt; Your whole point is that if people are so sick that they’re extremely symptomatic then of course they have high viral load

&gt;  That argument isn’t correct and the data is showing most vaccinated people who test positive don’t have symptoms or have mild symptoms."
8406,That does not contradict my point.
8407,"""Testing positive"" can also mean *low* viral-load."
8408,&gt;  Most vaccinated people who get covid don’t have severe symptoms.
8409,"Correct, **AND** their [viral-loads are lower!"
8410,"](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02187-1)

&gt; The results suggested that among people testing positive, those who had been vaccinated **had a lower viral load** on average than did unvaccinated people."
8411,"Paul Elliott, an epidemiologist at Imperial, says that these results differ from other Ct studies because this study sampled the population **at random** and included people who tested positive without showing symptoms."
8412,And then you follow it up with examples of how work is your social life and you need to be in the office because of it.
8413,[removed]
8414,Exactly.
8415,My sister wasn't put on the heart transplant list because she likely wouldn't survive the surgery.
8416,"Anyone that hasn't experienced some anxiety about the future, regardless of your personal vaccination status, should think more about the consequences of this illness on a large percentage of our population."
8417,"I am vaccinated, but I also recognize that this disease will leave many maimed, and many dead."
8418,More than any war we've fought.
8419,"I do not know the near future, even."
8420,"The effects of anti-vaxx opinions will also place strain on our society and economy long-term, before thinking of the effects of epistemological breakdown."
8421,"Yeah, I'm anxious about it."
8422,"I have young children too, to think of, and watching our society march on despite the death is unnerving."
8423,Super anecdotal.
8424,Are u really going to not say that MOST breakthru cases arent mild?
8425,Most cases in unvaxxed are mild!
8426,Sorry.
8427,This is the truth.

8435," ""But what we need to do is, just as we have to modulate fears so that we protect ourselves without driving ourselves crazy, we need to manage expectations for what life is going to look like once we have this virus under better control."""
8436,What kind of expectations is she referring to?
8437,Masks and social distancing forever?
8438,When are we going to tell the truth that breakthrough cases aren’t “rare”
8439,"I was hoping this meant people who cared enough about their health and everybody else's to get vaccinated get the bed and everybody else, minus kids, can park it in the hallway."
8440,"Seriously, their flow of information has been confusing from the start, what with ""masks are ineffective"" to ""vaccinated don't have to wear masks""."
8441,There is no war in ba sing se
8442,I have kids in school in Texas and can confirm I am indeed losing my mind.
8443,What?
8444,Why not?
8445,If its to protect the kid why not just send everyone home?
8446,Why are the unvaxxed willing to get monoclonal antibody treatment?

8474,I’m thinking that this means a vaccinated person in a car accident needing the ICU would and should get the last ICU bed even if an unvaccinated covid patient needs it.
8475,February 2020 I was the sickest I've been as far as I can ever remember.
8476,Terrible fever so bad my whole bed was soaked and I felt like I was hallucinating.
8477,"After I was ""better"" I had this really vicious dry cough that just wouldn't go away."
8478,At the time we knew very little about Covid outside it's basic symptoms so I called one of the hotlines to find out if I should do something / quarantine myself / I didn't know what.
8479,The only way I could get tested was like 1 of 3 hospitals nearby.
8480,My wife and I talked about it and kinda came away with the decision if I DIDN'T have Covid I was probably putting myself at serious risk of getting it by going there and I didn't.
8481,I never got antibody tests but I've always wondered if it could have been Covid or not.

8493,"Two of the three hospitalized were immunocompromised, as well, so depending, the vaccines may be doing little to none in them, regardless of time."
8494,"Nevertheless, it will be nice if we can get the Delta-tailored booster up and running in time before something worse comes along."

8659,Exactly triage during emergencies requires prioritizing survival.
8660,If vaccinated patients have better chance of recovery then they get priority on scarce resources.

8743,"I asked for the state you claimed is vaccinating kids, which you've done everything possible to avoid providing because you're full of s**t"
8744,Currently not eligible =/= struggling to get vaccinated.
8745,Important to mention vaccinated people have covid antibodies.
8746,Kinda the point of the vaccine.
8747,"That 94% figure includes vaccinated people, people who once had it, and active infections, it's not indicative of active infections."
8748,Their accuracy of reporting has been pretty...
8749,Loose.
8750,Countries banning flights in/out from other countries.

8755,Next week they’ll tell us we MIGHT not have to stick our dicks in vacuum cleaners to avoid catching shingles.

8757,"The “subject” of the story is the man taking the photo, not the person in the picture."
8758,The man was vaccinated but had a breakthrough case and went to get the recommended free treatment because the hospitals are currently overwhelmed in his area (Jacksonville).
8759,His symptoms are mild.
8760,"Once you start showing severe symptoms, the treatment doesn’t help."
8761,That’s why you take it before.
8762,"Breakthrough cases do happen, but we can always just look at the reported numbers."
8763,"Oregon, for example, is seeing roughly 7% vaccinated in their hospitalizations and less than 1% vaccinated for deaths."
8764,All of the vaccinated people had other serious illnesses or issues.
8765,This trend is repeated in other states as well.
8766,A vaccinated person is still still much less likely to be infected.
8767,And will have a shorter and more mild illness.
8768,Is it rare?
8769,Probably not the best word to use.
8770,But it’s a all relative.
8771,"Here in Ontario, Canada they are reporting the details daily and unvaccinated make up about 70-80% of the daily cases, despite being only 25 % of the population."
8772,That’s a good point…thank you.

8778,"Ultimately, having the vaccine affects your chance of survival from COVID."
8779,It's simply a part of the patient's medical history that has to be factored into the triage process.
8780,"Once they are in the position of rationing ICU beds, vents, etc., they have to prioritize patients with a higher chance of survival."

8829,"Unfortunately there are only like 6 of these sites in the whole state, so they are also being overrun by the desperate."

8841,Monoclonal antibodies as a therapy have been around for decades now for other illnesses.
8842,It’s not the same thing as vaccination.
8843,Vaccination stimulates your own body to make antibodies.
8844,This is a direct injection of antibodies.

8850,The person I replied to suggested Medicare/Medicaid should not pay for healthcare if the recipients aren’t vaccinated.
8851,There are lot of children on Medicaid not eligible for vaccine yet.
8852,I am not understanding how they're able to take this but too scared to get the shot it makes no sense whatsoever?

8859,It matters cause even though I’m vaccinated I’m apparently still able to pass it along to others and have just as much a viral load as someone who hasn’t even had their damn shot.
8860,There’s also people getting long Covid after being vaccinated too.
8861,"So yeah, it kinda does matter if it isn’t as rare as we’re being told."
8862,"No, science is just their bro, and you can’t just go disrespecting my bro without me saying something"
8863,"Yep, as I mentioned in an earlier comment, I know a guy who died due to not being able to stay sober"
8864,I’m so sorry he had to go through that.
8865,The hospitals should be for the vaccinated and children at this point.
8866,(Unless you have a *legitimate* reason to not have one.)
8867,You need a positive Covid test.
8868,"Here’s the thing though: The average wait for a test now is like a week in some areas, and then it takes 3-4 days to get the result after."
8869,Libraries actually make a lot of sense for public health stuff like this.
8870,"They usually have ample public transport access, AC, and space."
8871,We use them for warming and cooling shelters when needed as well.
8872,It’s really not that hard to convert them as needed.
8873,Don't over think it.
8874,Just get the booster when it's available to you.
8875,A shot in the arm is better than a shot sitting in a refrigerator.
8876,You are helping humanity by doing everything you can to stop yourself from being a disease vector.
8877,Pfizer alone is planning to hit 3 billion doses for 2021 so don't delay (especially if you live in a place with low vaccination rates where vaccines are expiring and being thrown away!
8878,).
8879,Couldn’t they just lie about their vaccination status?
8880,I’d imagine testing for antibodies may take longer than just a simple covid test and by then they’d be already admitted.
8881,You might want to check out the platforms of those running for governor right now.
8882,"And when they go home with covid and kill daddy, or grandma?"
8883,Also why do so many people ignore potential long-term effects?
8884,"I suspect they can't really understand because they haven't been personally impacted by long-term effects from other viruses or bacteria, but it's pretty terrible even for adults who got to live half their lives first without long-term effects from a sickness."
8885,I wonder if anti-maskers ever have moments of reflections and ask themselves why they are so angry and so willing to treat their fellow humans so poorly when all they want to do is protect people by wearing masks.
8886,Do anti-mask parents think school administrators are trying to have people wear masks for the next decade?

8892,They will point you in the right direction.
8893,Like that episode of Scrubs where an alcoholic was set to recieve a liver transplant (I think he had been sober for a while at that point) and as the surgery neared he somehow let it slip to the docs that he had a glass a champagne at his daughter's wedding and they denied him the transplant.
8894,"Forgive me if I got some of the details wrong, but I always wondered if situations like that come up in real life."
8895,Yeah.
8896,Might want to edit that one.
8897,It’s easier to just say “we don’t know yet and we don’t want to speculate” which is how the proverbial PR handbook says to handle these kinds of situations.
8898,"Otherwise the media will do exactly what it’s doing now, cherry pick pieces of your statement and turn it into a headline."
8899,There is currently no one who cannot receive the vaccine due to a medical condition other than being acutely ill (e.g.
8900,"viral illness, pneumonia, or those being treated in a hospital already)."
8901,The CDC otherwise recommends the vaccine for EVERYONE who is above age 11 (12 or above).

9000,It was probably an accident due to her being stuck in an appliance like a washing machine or dryer.
9001,"The do exactly what they’re designed to do, keep the surgeon’s spit droplets from spraying into someone’s open chest."
9002,Surgical masks are not designed to protect  the surgeon or patient from an airborne virus.
9003,Surgical masks let the air rush right around the side of them.
9004,Any doctor visiting the covid ward will have better than a surgical mask on.
9005,Let people that don’t get vaccinated sign for that they receive zero icu care in the worst case event.
9006,Done
9007,I was thinking if someone gets hit with a $500 bill when they go pick up their medication they will get the message pretty quick and vaccination rates will shoot up.
9008,The government has limited levers it can pull to get people to go get vaccinated and hitting their wallet should bring it home to them personally.
9009,I wouldn't support letting people die when there are resources available to save them but at the moment a lot of people are dying of non covid things because all the ICU's are full of unvaccinated covid patients.
9010,People who did the right thing by getting vaccinated shouldn't be left to die because of delusional selfish idiots taking up resources.
9011,Yeah my sister has to take immunosuppressants to live.
9012,It is a dangerous time.
9013,She was in New Zealand with us (no covid) but went back to Australia.
9014,right its not like the CDC doesn't know this after a year.
9015,they either want or don't care about health misinformation spreading
9016,Vaccines are available if this worries you.
9017,No need in getting upset though!
9018,YOLO!
9019,!
9020,Excellent.
9021,Downvoted for the truth.
9022,This sub hates good news and it hates the extremes that are necessary for damage control.
9023,"I had COVID in December, the first week just felt like a bad head cold then got worst, but I did have a mild case."
9024,"If it’s like WA, which I’m assuming it probably will be, it’s all public, private, and charter schools."
9025,"I'm surprised insurance companies did not live up to their evil selves by now, charing a sliding scale for people depending on their vaxx status."
9026,"2nd shot 10$.1st shot 20$.no shot 34,543$ per day."
9027,I hate stupid people
9028,"Triage protocol is usually not to save those with the highest likelihood of survival, it divides people into 3 buckets."
9029,"Those who will probably survive without care (highest chance of surviving overall), those who will probably survive with care, and those who will probably die even with care."
9030,The exact boundaries for the three are flexible but the point is that by focusing on the middle group you save as many lives as possible because you're focusing on the people for whom you can make the greatest difference in their odds of survival.
9031,People with the highest chance of surviving will just be told to tough it out at home.
9032,Nice.

9041,That is the definition of triage.
9042,A lot of anti vaxers assume that there is no supply limit to medical care…it is a lot different without a safety net.
9043,Okay I understood that wrong.
9044,I thought you were saying people weren’t getting them free.
9045,"I went to a vaccine event, showed them my card,  and checked I was immune compromised."
9046,Gee.
9047,I wonder what group of people downvoted your information.
9048,"Most antivaxxers won't die, they will (or already have) be infected multiple times over, with less and less symptoms each time."
9049,"The exact details of what a long-term natural immunity are up for debate, will they endlessly be reinfected every 4 to 6 months until one time it just gets the best of them?"
9050,Or will their bodies get so good at fighting it off that they are no longer asymptomatic reservoirs?
9051,Still have to either vaccinate the children or let covid ping pong between them
9052,Yup its called triage and there are two mains schools of thought 1) treat the sickest first 2) treat those with the best chance of survival first.
9053,Or just first come first serve but that's lazy.
9054,That's not the point.
9055,The point is the governor is forbidding steps to protect the public from transmission while being funded by the same company that provides a treatment.
9056,He is knowingly increasing transmission rates while his donors profit off of the treatments.
9057,Do you honestly think surgical masks would still be used in surgery if they did nothing?
9058,"If you are fully vaccinated and get a breakthrough case, I’m curious what that means for further protection?"
9059,[deleted]
9060,Im not sure where you live but where I live insurance does take into account your lifestyle choices.
9061,And can choose not to cover things based on those choices.
9062,"We could say that, or we could look at the caseload in the hospitals in Texas and Florida, vrs those of states with higher vaccination rates, and make our decision from there...."
9063,"I mean, does it matter who pays for it?"
9064,If you bribed a politician to down play a vaccine and endorse an alternative that would be worth looking into.
9065,"I mean not saying that it is, just saying it is worth looking into."
9066,"They are not talking about denying care for the heck of it, they are discussing triage."
9067,If you have 2 patients that need an ICU bed and have only one bed available a choice needs to be made.
9068,"According to decades long principles of triage, you treat the person most likely to survive."
9069,"If both patients have a similar medical history but one of them is vaccinated, the vaccinated one is statistically more likely to survive and therefore should get priority."
9070,And if there are 2 beds available both patients get treatment.
9071,If individuals choose to make decisions that lower their chances of survival we shouldn't be outraged when doctors take that information into account in a triage situation.
9072,I just got back 5 days ago from a 10 day vacation/trip to see family in Ghana.
9073,It was amazing.
9074,"Whether I'm dealing with Covid here in the US, or somewhere else, what does it matter?"
9075,"I'm fully vaxxed, masked, took the required PCR tests before, during and after the trip, all negative."
9076,"As an aside, I also got the Yellow Fever vax for the trip, and had already gotten typhoid within the last 5 years for a trip to Zambia in 2017."
9077,"I feel like this is our new normal, unfortunately, and am done having my life on hold."
9078,"If I want to travel, I will follow all required guidelines."
9079,Seems to agree with what has been studied thus far in US.
9080,That's why everyone should be in masks again - vaccinated or not.
9081,"I think it is an actual triage guideline for North Texas hospitals, so it is reported as news, not opinion."
9082,Thanks for the insight!
9083,I will try to be patient.

9086,The best vaccines for developing countries are not necessarily mRNA vaccines.
9087,Focusing on vaccines that need little to no refrigeration would have a far wider reach globally.
9088,The US was able to scale a production of mRNA vaccines because we actually had facilities to produce them and people with the technical expertise.
9089,The US has been working on mRNA technology in one fashion or another for the last 30 years.
9090,It wasn’t that the country was able to create something out of nothing but the US gave more resources to an existing system.
9091,I believe it’s the non-RNA vaccines that are probably the most easy to scale up.
9092,However a single mistake during the manufacturing process could cost the public’s trust.
9093,Facilities are being expanded in multiple countries and vaccines of many different types are being made.
9094,"I think the viral vector, protein subunit, and whole virus vaccines a hold the most promise for rapid expansion."
9095,Of course much of this depends on existing facilities and supply chains.
9096,Same!
9097,It's awful .
9098,I guess they need a couple of child deaths to make them change their minds.
9099,So infuriating how every step of this pandemic has been bungled because of a certain subset of people.
9100,How is that possible if the virus isn’t duplicating in the lungs if you’re vaccinated?
9101,It’s absolutely ridiculous.
9102,I emailed my child’s school principal AND superintendent.
9103,I urged them to please reconsider notifying parents.
9104,"I told them that we have a small child at home who has a chronic lung condition and at the very least, a notification will help me keep some distance between my school aged child and my 2 year old."
9105,I brought up the fact that they notify us of lice.
9106,"But they just told me that per their lawyers advice, they aren’t going to notify us."
9107,And that the privacy of their staff is the most important to them.
9108,I know it’s dramatic but I literally cried.
9109,I disagree.

9115,No.
9116,But their political leaders who will financially benefit from their use of regeneron have told them regeneron is safe and effective…
9117,&gt; It makes sense.
9118,"If there is a list for organs, people who don't take care of themselves are booted off the list or to the bottom."
9119,Thats how it should be.
9120,If health insurance charged people more money for not taking care of themselves and people who do take care of themselves pay less money then more people would be healthy and health insurance would cost less money.
9121,"I eat healthy, workout, and get 1 physical a year and I pay the same for health insurance as my neighbor who weights 400lbs goes to the doctor 3+ times a month, is on insulin and other medication for life."
9122,Makes sense that we pay the same rate.

9124,It is possible to be [vaccinated and not have antibodies](https://www.jhsph.edu/covid-19/articles/covid-19-vaccines-and-immunocompromised-people-fully-vaccinated-and-not-protected.html).
9125,"It tends to happen in people who are taking some form of immune system suppressing medication, either to prevent organ rejection after a transplant or to fight cancer or to treat autoimmune disorders."
9126,Generally it's a case where having a strong immune system will cause more harm to the patient on a day to day basis than suppressing their immune system.

9217,The point is that this virus is passed by inhaling it into your respiratory system.
9218,"Since there is still such a high number of unvaccinated individuals, the more infections that are allowed the greater chance for even worse variants."
9219,The only way to stop the current surge is to wear masks since even getting vaccinated right now means you aren't fully vaccinated for 6 weeks.

9250,Correct.
9251,And Pfizer and Moderna are both currently in test phase with delta specific upgrade vaccines.
9252,But they're nowhere near FDA emergency approval and a booster is needed now.

9260,*
9261,I hear you.
9262,And I dont think its necessarily reckless to see some friends - I get that we are social creatures and its incredibly detrimental to lock ourselves inside.
9263,"But, I think we should still try to limit the spread of the virus."
9264,"I work in healthcare staffing, and I cant express to you enough how much hospital systems are taxed right now, and how much we're seeing the grave effects of that."
9265,"Even if you perhaps dont care if antivaxxers get sick, the fact that the virus continues to spread so fiercely is wrecking havoc on our healthcare resources in a way that impacts ""innocent"" lives."
9266,"Healthcare workers are exhausted, sometimes irreparably so."
9267,"In places where ERs are struggling with capacity issues, if you get in a car accident, or have a heart attack, there is literally nowhere for you to get care."
9268,"And if you have a mild/moderate medical condition, your treatment may be placed on hold entirely."
9269,Theres are also children and immunocompromised folks that are dependent on us all to not coat the country in corona.
9270,"About 2.7% of Americans are immunocompromised, which seems like a sizable group of people to me."
9271,"Yes it's true that some people have always had to take additional precautions due to medical issues - but the US seems like a covid19 cesspool at the moment, and those aren't typical conditions for a medically susceptible person to endure."
9272,"Again, I understand it's been a long road."
9273,I'm not suggesting we completely hunker down.
9274,I'm just saying... do we have to go all Full Rona Rampage Fest 2021??
9275,"I think people really can live with masks on shared transportation, and maybe without enormous indoor events and packed bars."
9276,It just seems excessive considering how much we are seeing shit hit the fan.
9277,"Not to mention, you have a mass of people evacuating to crowded spaces and coughing a ton."
9278,"Last winter I had to stay in a hotel for a few days because an ice storm killed power across the state, and all I could think about was how many people crammed into that place with me might’ve been infected."
9279,"Well, that and worrying about the state of my yard."
9280,The federal government should have never sent a soul to help until the state shut things down.
9281,"The whole point of NPI’s is to preserve the hospitals, if your hospitals are capped it’s time to act."
9282,I wouldn't stick a straight line on rate of efficacy decline.
9283,Antibodies decline logarithmically so the rate of decline may slow down the lower the efficacy from the get go.

9289,Exactly.
9290,And that vaccines work.
9291,Can you link me something on this?
9292,As far as I know it was duplicating in the lungs.
9293,What cells is it infecting in the nose?
9294,Probably something to do with HIPAA.
9295,"Something most of us will never fully understand all the rules of, but a vocal minority will scream it at the top of their lungs as soon as you ask them if they are sick."
9296,No as you’re assuming an even spread of deaths and cases between vaccinated and non vaccinated people.
9297,"People with the vaccine are still more resistant to the delta variant than those without the vaccine, so the majority of deaths will still be from the non vaccinated."
9298,"&gt;Rommie Amaro , a computational biophysical chemist (and Superhero of Science), helped develop a detailed visualization of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that efficiently latches onto our cell receptors."
9299,"Ox-Astra is a technically a carrier or viral vector vaccine that used as inactivated chimpanzee adenovirus, it is not an mRNA vaccine."
9300,So perhaps more traditional would be more accurate but the BioNtech and Moderna are different and considered true mRNA vaccines .

9309,What are you talking about..
9310,Sounds like you know this 11 year old that actually died from covid and not pneumonia?
9311,It’s for their own health and safety.
9312,If they wish to work in a career where disease and pests spread rampantly then they have to be prepared to protect themselves and their studentd.
9313,"Similar to long term care, there are other careers that use the same skillset that would be better placed for a person with vaccine concerns."
9314,I can agree with that.
9315,"There were positives, for sure."
9316,257 voters.

9318,Bush.
9319,A packed maskless stadium while Alabama rolls some AA school.
9320,Yeah that should be fine.
9321,[removed]
9322,The delta variant carries a viral load that is at least 1000x that of alpha.
9323,That means you breath in a lot more of the contagion which in turns gives it an exponentially higher chance of infection.
9324,The vaccines have essentially prepared your body on how to fight the virus.
9325,"If you are vaccinated, and you get infected, you have a much lower chance of becoming seriously ill because your body knows how to fight back."
9326,[removed]
9327,"I hadn't seen at Iceland's cases recently holy cow lol, they grew 1900% on 2 weeks from July 16-31st, but now they're trending down, awesome, just proves that vaccines work and that the Delta wave is a quick one."
9328,The general theory of immunology would say yes.
9329,Pretty sure I read a piece a little while ago from a doctor saying just that.
9330,It’s replicating in your nose and throat.
9331,And the infection lasts for a shorter duration.
9332,Protection against delta  after the first dose is about 35% with the mRNA vaccines last I checked (1.5 months ago).
9333,"Waiting longer is generally better, with a 2 month wait offering significantly better protection than a 3 week one."
9334,"Oh, shocking"
9335,Sounds about right.
9336,"Peru has the highest covid death rate in the world, and adjusted for population, would be equivalent to 8 million deaths in India."
9337,If we used Brazil's death rate that would put India around 3.6 million deaths.
9338,It is not just for them.
9339,"Vaccinated people can also become infected, what vaccine does is it makes it easier to survive."
9340,So the virua is still evolving even in vaccinated people.
9341,If we don't take care now more variants will keep coming.
9342,Also remember that there are a lot of people that can't vaccinate like kids.
9343,It matters because I'm not willing to throw myself into risky situations when cases are high.
9344,"I live in Missouri (where we are seemingly on the downhill again) and I'm not interested in seeing how well my vaccine works, honestly."
9345,And stepping foot into the southern states with cases that high?

9361,"He described the memo to the task force as a “homework assignment.” In a reversal, he told NBC-5 that vaccinations should not be among the factors hospitals should consider when making critical care triage decisions._"
9362,The local Catholic hospital system in Tennessee (Ascension) is requiring COVID vaccination for their employees and will fire any who aren't vaccinated by the deadline.
9363,So Catholics aren't the problem with COVID vaccination.
9364,My mom did her part and got vaccinated.
9365,"She actually got her first shot in December, and she used her early experience to convince some hesitant folks to also get vaccinated."

9378,There’s no excuse.
9379,"But in any case, it’s not relevant either way because triage is not about punishing unvaccinated people, it’s about saving the people most likely to survive and this is reality right now."
9380,It's called triage.
9381,You save who can be saved.
9382,Texas SCOTUS also just temporarily allowed masks on a technicality now too.

9387,"That’s horseshit, no excuse for that anymore."
9388,CVS and Walgreens are all over cities in and near low income areas and they’re free.
9389,"The real reason they’re unvaccinated is because low income and low education demographics are getting bombarded online with misinformation and it’s spread like wildfire, especially within the African American community."
9390,"&gt;For example, telling someone “there is no conclusive evidence that drinking grape soda doesn’t cause cancer” has an implied subtext of danger, when medically and scientifically speaking that is true and neutral."
9391,"That could even produce the headline ""Scientists say grape soda does not cause cancer""."
9392,There are multiple instances when a scientific report resulted in 2 polar opposite headlines.
9393,&gt;I still feel the CDC needs to get better at PR and being sensitive to how both the media and the average person reacts to some of these statements.
9394,I agree.
9395,But the media reacts not with the interest of truth but in forming a narrative that would give them profits.
9396,So it's practically impossible to control the narrative to stick to facts.
9397,I think that is fair.

9411,I am fully vaccinated but while not immunocompromised I am at high risk of dying if I get it.
9412,I produced antibodies but they drop faster.

9483,"It's not really a defense because the reason they thought that is incredibly dumb, but thanks to a tuberculosis related mix up at some point, every public health professional in the world assumed that droplets larger than 5 micrometers rapidly fall to the ground and contaminate surfaces."
9484,Hence why basically no virus is considered airborne.
9485,If that were true it'd be basically impossible for droplets to get you sick directly.
9486,The problem is that this is not true and droplets up to ~100 micrometers can stay in the air for hours.
9487,No one said we wouldn’t.
9488,Fauci said there wasn’t data that we needed one yet.
9489,There is new data coming out almost every day.
9490,The weight of the evidence became that a booster would be beneficial.

9499,"Now, Florida is reporting cases by the “case date,” according to the CDC rather than the date the case was logged into the system."

9516,"The reverse might imply that, but this order implies people are so worried about the spike in cases that they are getting vaccinated when they had previously been hesitant."

9555,Was it also science based to tell vaccinated people they can take their masks off a couple months ago?
9556,Many high risk people are still taking precautions and not back to normal life.
9557,People are so stupid.
9558,"So instead of taking a vaccine to prevent severe illness that:

1) costs the public $40 for both doses and 

2) has been studied in an *exceptionally* large number of people and

3) gives you durable cross-reactive resistance to the virus and future variants for the future

These people decide to:

1) forego the vaccine and get super sick

2) take monoclonals which cost the public $1,500 per dose, and which...

3) have been studied in just a fraction of people compared to the vaccines

4) continue to have the audacity to say big monied interests are behind the push for vaccines and...

5) will still statistically have a worse chance of recovery and a higher chance of Long COVID because they let the disease progress"

9564,"The data used for the study do not show how likely it is that a fully vaccinated person with the Delta variant can pass on the infection to another individual, compared to an unvaccinated individual with the virus."
9565,But the high viral loads found in the study are a strong indicator that the risks of transmission from both vaccinated and unvaccinated people with the Delta variant could be similar.
9566,"Isn't possible that with reduced symptoms, things like coughing less end up reducing the transmission?"
9567,(This is a question.
9568,I'm in no position to make a statement like this)
9569,This would reduce capacity
9570,Really?
9571,I thought we offered a free vaccine.
9572,Yep.
9573,And to prove it yet again Beshear stated today that in the 19-20 flu season KY had 29k+ cases of flu.

9577,I’ve accepted that we as a species don’t have a plan to prioritize lives in the face of climate change and it’s effects like increased pandemics.

9579,"At a smaller scale, individuals like doctors and others are still trying to save lives at least, for now."

9854,Who the hell ever agreed there was vaccine equity (or any equity) between countries or continents?
9855,From the article you posted.
9856,"&amp;#x200B;

""In the case of COVID-19, the vector virus delivers specific genetic instructions to the cells in the body to produce a harmless piece of SARS-CoV-2 called the spike protein."
9857,"The cells then display this spike protein and the immune system triggers a response""."
9858,How do you think your cells are instructed to make these viral proteins ?
9859,"DNA from the vector gets transcribed into mRNA which then instructs your cellular machinery to make the proteins that was encoded into that sequence of mRNA

mRNA is what instructs your cells to make the  proteins  you need day in and day out."
9860,Its part of every day biology.
9861,Its also used by viruses or in this case vaccines to produce viral proteins.
9862,The mRNA vaccines just skip the vector virus part and use  mRNA directly.
9863,Both of them are still  very different from traditional vaccines that would either attenuate  or deactivate the  SARS-COV-2 virus then inject  that.
9864,"I found this article to be very helpful in understanding this:

https://www.tampabay.com/opinion/2021/08/10/what-we-now-know-about-how-to-fight-the-delta-variant-of-covid-column/?fbclid=IwAR1WSkExKrlSKK0wLs0G7097o5K0lgu6j-_BDHz5cZ5-xzeazLOCeMWDFNE"

9868,"The blood meals of frozen tick samples could be examined for traces of the coronavirus, which would be extremely helpful in identifying infected species prior to December 2019."
9869,Xiao didn’t respond to emails requesting comment.
9870,"The evidence sounds like it would be in those tick samples, why aren’t those being studied?"
9871,You think it will be worse than 2021?

9874,"And then when she has a positive experience,  she'll help spread the word."
9875,That's what happened with the flu shot for me.
9876,I went from hell no to marking my calendar in October to get one.
9877,"Meanwhile, my kid had a minor stomach bug the night before school started - and per usual [non pandemic - and of course pandemic] guidance, I kept her home the first day of school (e.g."
9878,"""24 hours vomit free"" - even though she was fine the next day), but still had to get her a test to come back, because that's one of the (many) covid symptoms."
9879,"it's so quick and easy to get a test, why the heck not?"
9880,"(Our school now does a rapid test, at the school."
9881,"Just have to bring her in for a quick swab by our school RN, and she calls 15 mins later)"
9882,Well said.
9883,"What many won't mention is that even before the pandemic, masks were seen as highly rude in America."
9884,"Very often if you wore something covering your face, you were associated with nefarious activity \[as well as being cowardly\]."
9885,We were taught as kids to cough into our arms instead of wearing masks.
9886,Masks have also been banned from school dress-codes as far as I know for a long time.
9887,"Apparently, the virus that causes CoViD-19 protects itself from the immune system using a 'hoodie' made out of sugars."
9888,The virus periodically pulls back that 'hoodie' so that it can latch onto cells.
9889,"(also, apparently, 'hoodies' are fairly common to viruses)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

AFAIK, last year, researchers photographed viruses with their 'hoodies' on and off, and photographed viruses that were partially and fully attached to human cells."
9890,"&amp;#x200B;

The OP article speaks to how a team of researchers, using super-computers, were able to simulate the opening and closing process of the virus's 'hoodies.'"
9891,"&amp;#x200B;

I believe that one of the researchers behind the simulation is quoted in the OP article as suggesting that this information could be used to build novel therapeutics; specifically:

&amp;#x200B;

""""""Amaro believes the research team's gate discovery opens potential avenues for new therapeutics to counter SARS-CoV-2 infection."
9892,"If glycan gates could be pharmacologically locked in the closed position, then the virus is effectively prevented from opening to entry and infection."""""""
9893,"('hoodie' for me is ""gate"" for them)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm curious as to whether anyone can speculate (or smartulate) as to how long permanently 'hoodied' viruses would float around in our system."
9894,I'm curious as to whether anyone can speculate (or smartulate) as to whether the proteins we make after taking Pfizer have similar hoodies... my guess is probably no; and that there's no reason then to try to open non-existing hoodies in an attempt to make the vaccines more effective.
9895,Lotsa other question too.
9896,Is this like when they said we just needed 15 days to flatten the curve?
9897,"Yes, but haven't you actually seen the stats on what happens when you get re-infected?"
9898,An infection with original covid was as good as pfizer vaccine at preventing death from alpha infection.
9899,An original infection plus pfizer vaccine makes people almost totally immune to delta infection (when pfizer vaccine alone was only 60% effective) in a study that came out today from the UK.
9900,"I'm an immunologist, so I understand how it works."
9901,Variants don't evade the immune system like you think they do.
9902,Even the delta variant is almost identical to original covid as far as the immune system is concerned.
9903,"Subsequent infections will happen after immunity wanes, but your long term immune memory is ready to reactivate when that happens."
9904,"You might catch covid and have mild symptoms, but you won't die from it."
9905,That's what long term immunity to an endemic pathogen looks like.
9906,That's why you've never heard of HCoV-OC43 until now.

9908,"Kids aren't protected yet, currently only kids within 3 months of turning 18 can schedule their vaccine."

9910,"So, not good if you care about young people."
9911,Yea I'd like to know what the end game here is too.
9912,I did and continue to do my part - sheltered in place and got vaccinated as soon as I could.
9913,Now I want to go out with other vaccinated people and live life again.
9914,Are the responsible people supposed to shoulder the burden for the irresponsible forever?

9918,Fucking liars juicing their stats
9919,The antibodies don’t vanish.
9920,"The level decreases over time, and different in different people."
9921,"This just relates to blocking the initial infection- once exposed, memory cells produce more antibodies to fight the infection, as well as cellular immunity kicking in."
9922,This is how all vaccines work.
9923,5-10 years is still a long time with masks and restrictions… ugh.
9924,"But I appreciate your insight and sharing, thanks"

9958,Although as this point everyone’s had the vaccines and I’ve being a full supporter of lockdowns etc but at this point if things get locked down with the rate of vaccinations it’s complete bullshit and we have to just move on and live with it being part of our lives.

10020,From a dispassionate statistical perspective there might be an argument to be made that it might be better to 'let her rip' in schools to get all those infections over with as quickly as possible to minimise disruption to another school year but the complicating factor is the kids grandparents vaccinated last Spring who's antibodies are waning and who's T and B Memory immune cell response is not as robust as the kids parents leaving them open to greater risk of breakout infection and hospitalisation and even death if they are infected by the grandkids.
10021,"In other words, even if it was statistically or morally right to 'let her rip' in schools, we can't actually do it until we've given the 60+ folks their boosters so that they have fuller protection with active antibodies in the blood as well as the memory cells during the time we planned to 'let her rip' in the schools."

10157,Testing in parts of Florida is maxed out so the case numbers dont completely reflect the reality on the ground.
10158,Not sure what it is like elsewhere.
10159,And recklessness use of alcohol.
10160,"""Since February, residents 12 and older who weren’t fully vaccinated made up about 93.7% of COVID-19 cases, 94.5% of hospitalizations and 92.9% of deaths in the state, according to DOH."
10161,"People who say “no” to the vaccine are not saying no to medical care once they get sick, said Sauer, which is “deeply frustrating” to hospital staff."""
10162,I'm too frustrated to say anything clever.

10164,Thank you for your hard work.
10165,How recently?
10166,I'm just going by conversations with our state rep and how we have acted since.
10167,Its possible some schools dont realize it.
10168,I also think this is a change thst has happened in the past 5 years.
10169,Look at past pandemics.
10170,We are probably in the middle of this one.
10171,It sucks.
10172,It won’t be forever but we will be dealing with this for awhile longer.

10182,"We've got a long history of being imprisoned so it's in our DNA 😂


But jokes aside, the frustrations have run out."
10183,This is purely just because our leaders can't make an informed risk decision.
10184,Every decision is based on the media optics than the outcome.
10185,"I don't think the CDC is

[CDC COVID Reporting Breakthrough Cases](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/health-departments/breakthrough-cases.html)

&gt; As of May 1, 2021, CDC transitioned from monitoring all reported vaccine breakthrough cases to focus on identifying and investigating only hospitalized or fatal cases due to any cause."
10186,Our Governor is a big part of the problem.While she has been outspoken on taking the vaccine she also will not take any measures outside of telling people they should be responsible.
10187,"Her saying ""Alabama is open for business"" proudly while ignoring what is going on is ignorant."
10188,She said she is all out of ideas..So step aside if you can not lead.
10189,"She panders to her moronic base,and sadly that is 65% of our state."
10190,"I mean... he's in the hospital, so not great."
10191,It’s true.
10192,Smallpox is a horrible disease but it’s easy to prevent.
10193,The first vaccine ever developed in 1796 (thanks to cows).
10194,It was a low-hanging fruit for eradication.

10196,Right.
10197,I think the quote was more used in context to explain why the mitigation measures were going to be necessary.
10198,"Once EUA exists for the 5-11yr group, I do think we'll be past the peak as the number of population easily infected is going to be a lot lower due to prev infections, adequate immune response from vaccine, and increased mask usage."
10199,That'll likely be in the fall timeframe for Pfizer and winter for Moderna.
10200,As u/chazj says: not HIPAA.
10201,"Medical privacy, yes, but out of courtesy, ethics, etc.—NOT law, and especially NOT HIPAA"
10202,"Not only that, it assumes homogeneous mixing of the populations, instantaneous infection, no personal measures, etc."
10203,This is pretty much the case everywhere in the US.
10204,Rural and/or poor.
10205,Across all races.
10206,Getting wrecked again by false logic and then the virus.
10207,"Unpopular theory here, but I don’t think that’s moving people."
10208,I think a laaarge chunk of these “newly vaccinated” are people seeking boosters.
10209,"Several of my friends posed as first time vaxxers to get another one because they are deathly terrified of the virus, they work in healthcare or at risk populations or go it back in Jan/Feb/March like myself."
10210,This has been a free for all.
10211,I started wearing masks before it was a mandated thing and I stayed all day outside of rural clinics waiting for someone to turn down a dose so I could get it in Jan. They’ve been slow about boosters while delta and breakthroughs rage.
10212,I really really don’t blame people for taking it on themselves to lie or whatever to save their own lives.

10225,"What happened with Kay Ivey at the beginning saying she would follow Drs,and Science?"
10226,"She is a huge let down.All she has done is take half steps,and pander to her base,then when she got news what her base caused,and is causing she lost her shit,and blamed then saying she is out if ideas.Up until then she praised ""the good folks of Alabama"" for doing their part.my entire family is vaccinated,we have masked and distanced since it began and still do.My kids are in the 2nd year of virtual school,we do not go out except to work,and for groceries and the Drs."
10227,"I am so tired if the proud ignorance,and defiance these morons show.We suffer,and they overflow our hospitals."
10228,"All the kids over 12 who could of been vaccinated,but were kept from it by their parents kills me.Thet are literally killing their own kids,and screaming they will not comply with the simplest of measures."

10238,"I’ve been coughing up blood for 18 months, can confirm it is not psychological- I also would agree that think it’s just the same as post viral illnesses from the flu is inaccurate."
10239,"They probably all think that since they all got exposed to it, they’ll have an immunity now and don’t need either a vaccine or a mess."
10240,Are these antibody treatments available to anyone now?
10241,"Like if my kid caught covid, could I just get them one of those treatments or do they have to wait until they are having a severe case, in which case the antibody treatment won't help as much anymore."
10242,Well then I blame Jebus.
10243,It is his world and he created it in some 9 days or something……sorry if I have some of this information wrong I’m not big on reading fiction.
10244,Maybe what we need now is it a Noah’s ark style cleansing of the earth of these stupid fake religious Republicans.
10245,Maybe they can move back to Russia where they were all born.
10246,Again sorry for any false information in this (humor people).
10247,But seriously fuck these Republicans and they’re stupid religion.
10248,There are no different than the Taliban Hell even that Lauren Bobert supports the Taliban I guess that’s why the Republicans kept her in and voted for her.
10249,Because she’s a Taliban supporter
10250,This applies only if no mitigation measures and significant immunity in the population.
10251,Germany's system is called Mixed Member Proportional.
10252,"It's also used in New Zealand, and it's a great system."
10253,"People keep saying 'Ranked choice voting' would help, but not really."
10254,Typically people are referring to instant runoff when they say ranked choice.
10255,"Although some proportional systems use ranking, the most important part to breaking the two party stranglehold is that the system be proportional - i.e."

10258,"One aspect to look at is what interventions senior doctors choose or refuse for themselves when the time comes - as a rule, they consent to significantly less of such activities as the average person."

10480,I wish these people would quit whining and fighting this shit.
10481,Just mask and get vaxxed.
10482,Its not hard.
10483,Get over it.
10484,People seem to think Tuskegee was about deliberately *infecting* black people.
10485,It wasn't.
10486,It was about deliberately *withholding* medication from sick people.
10487,Are most of these hospitalizations happening in eastern Oregon?
10488,I thought Portland and the surrounding suburbs had pretty good vaccine coverage.
10489,"You did not ask for the denominator, your question was 'how many died since december' and that question was answered."
10490,"If there are no more beds for the unvaccinated, that is a risk they knowingly chose - to not get vaccinated and knowing the limited medical resources available."
10491,It's too late to help them.
10492,"The very last for it to end, and the very first to bring it back."

10494,Here in Iceland we have over 90% vaccinated.
10495,"Yet we have way more cases than ever, because the Delta variant unfortunately won't let countries have herd immunity with the vaccines we got this year."
10496,So even if US had 100% of people vaccinated then you'd still need social restrictions.
10497,However in Iceland we are seeing fewer people getting sick and so far 0 deaths in the past months.
10498,I work at a Walmart.
10499,We've got chairs set up across the aisle from Pharmacy for the 15 minute waiting period after you get the vaccine.
10500,The chairs are **always** empty.
10501,"When I left work yesterday morning, all the chairs were full &amp; there was a line at the vaccination table."
10502,"So, maybe."
10503,I don't think there are any nationwide data.
10504,The NY Times reported the other day on data from seven states.
10505,"In six of them, breakthrough cases accounted for 18-28 percent of cases in recent weeks."
10506,"In the seventh state, Virginia, only 6 percent of cases were breakthrough cases."

10509,i think i have a pretty good idea actually.
10510,"as far as kids icu goes, the average was 66% full over the past couple years, so these states that have run out (or a couple of them running over capacity) is highly unusual, but yeah definitely ""rare"" that ""all of the few"" kids are impacted because clearly they must be only kids with risk ""factors"""
10511,"Except that a Covid Zero policy will never, ever work unless the island stays isolated forever."
10512,Just vaccinate the population and move on.
10513,"Yes, that's a very good point."
10514,"We also mustn't forget that, despite the news at times, that healthy people under 70 have always had a tiny risk from Covid19 in many other places too."

10516,Let's assign ALL of them to the white demographic.
10517,That leaves eligible white population that is unvaccinated to be 2.5M.
10518,The eligible black population is 3M.
10519,I feel like the Northeast USis doing about as well as the UK in this regard.
10520,Every NE state is seeing a rise in cases but a more mild increase in hospitalizations and I haven’t seen any panicked messaging from the hospital system.
10521,Do you know what a denominator is?
10522,I’m sorry but calling the massive snow storm that Texas had was “a little cold” is the same as saying corona is “just a flu”.
10523,They had no infrastructure in place to handle an amount of snow that even northern states may struggle dealing with.
10524,"Obviously yes they should’ve had SOME form of emergency control, but let’s not discount the struggle that Texans went through."
10525,Seems like it's time to leave that person behind.
10526,Except rapid mutations mean no immunity for anyone
10527,How nice of the US to protect Canada from the US.
10528,"Dude above you said studies, not white supremacist Twitter."

10532,strange feeling that racists are paid from the people.
10533,"I would make her get tested before she's around you again, but that's just me."
10534,We traveled by car to see some friends a few weeks ago with unvaxxed kids (both parents are vaxxed) and we tested before and after.
10535,Before for their safety and after for our friends and family that we would see after.
10536,It was certainly a nice break

10576,Above 101%
10577,"This is correct, even if inconvenient."
10578,Reality is the UK and Europe are also in for a tough autumn and winter even with higher vaccination rates and much less antivax sentiment.
10579,"Vaccines have absolutely reduced hospitalizations but ""only"" by about 50% (look at the ratio of hospitalizations to cases now vs. last winter/spring, and you'll see what I mean), while transmission is still very high - higher than last summer, which means we're entering September in a not-great place."
10580,"If you combine that reality with no restrictions, patchy mask-wearing, schools and offices reopening en masse, and people not caring about the virus anymore, you will absolutely get a jump in cases and a bad wave of hospitalizations this autumn/winter even with a highly vaccinated population."
10581,Delta is wicked.
10582,You should lurk over on /r/nursing and read some of those unvaxxed patient stories.
10583,There was an article here.
10584,"I've linked it before, where 20% of vaccinated healthcare workers in the breakthrough cases studied ended up with long covid."
10585,It's still better than the 30% shown in studies of the unvaccinated.
10586,But we still need more data on it.
10587,Also the vaccine still works extremely well for hospitalization and death.
10588,It's worth getting for that alone.
10589,But we still have work to do on the long term implications of mild and asymptomatic covid infections before we declare victory.
10590,"I work in the event industry and our typical attendee is a c-suite executive at a fortune 100 company (CIO, CISO, CHRO…etc)."
10591,"They definitely see the in person interaction as important, however i think the real reason is that virtual work has exposed the executives lack of expertise."
10592,So many companies run off the culture of a scary boss watching you work and lots of underlings doing everything they can to climb the grease pole.
10593,This relationship has been severely compromised and the amount of internal frustration with senior leadership at 90% of these companies is starting to worry the PMC.

10652,I don't even know if anyone would have bother getting the vaccine if it were that ineffective.
10653,The chances of any long term disability from getting vid with a vaccine are extremely negligible
10654,The issue you have is you can't convert someone who won't listen to reason and statistics.
10655,For example this is rarely fatal and occurs rarely as is.
10656,Your odds of dying from covid are vastly higher than to even have this issue occur.
10657,Your odds of having severe issues with covid are even higher.
10658,Your anti-vaxxers don't care about either of these things.
10659,They are eligible and it has been available to 12 and up since middle to late May.
10660,Unfortunately for the 12 -17 group they need parent permission to get vaccinated and parents who are not getting vaccinated are unlikely to permit their kids to get it.

10692,"People shouldn't be okay with getting it, bottom line."
10693,If you are vaccinated you have nothing to worry about especially if you live in a highly vaccinated area.
10694,“Waning immunity” is a misnomer - the only reason it is a thing is because the original vaccines were far better than expected.
10695,The expectation for a vaccine is not that is prevents infection but that it prevents serious illness.
10696,All 3 shots still prevent serious illness and actually most still prevent infection but at a lower rate.
10697,The vaccines work and are still working better than we could have imagined.
10698,We are being told by the cdc to mask up for the sole purpose of a chance that if everyone masks in the county so will unvaccinated people.
10699,This is the same with all the other safety measures we are taking.
10700,If you had a vaccine mandate and 90% got the vaccine you would still have breakthrough cases a tiny amount of serious cases and people getting flu like symptoms.

10704,I suppose.
10705,I think it opens the door to more places that previously wouldn't have had offshore teams to have that relationship.
10706,"Ten years ago my partners in India were primarily on the data science/analysis side of things, but I've seen it accelerated in my role (marketing) over the past 18 months to include creative, research, strategy, business roles - previously those just would've been stateside because in-office was how those things happened."
10707,"Now, everyone is comfortable with team meetings all taking place between 8am and 11am to accommodate time zones and everyone has the tools to do it, and there's no awkwardness because we're all working remotely anyhow."
10708,"It allows the India teams to be much more integrated into the team without ""sacrificing"" the existing team culture or making them feel out of place."
10709,"Unfortunately, the fact is that much of the world doesn't have access to Western vaccines still (especially if developed countries are going to start giving their citizens a 3rd booster shot)

So large parts of the developing world **only** has access to Chinese / non-Western vaccines in many cases."

10735,LOL at thinking that requiring a vaccine or masks to eat in a private business during a global pandemic is an authoritarian dystopian nightmare or that the fucking morons who are choosing to be anti vax are on the same level as people stuck in the lower rungs of a caste system.

10748,Oh and its incredibly rare in the first place?
10749,"Good they are investigating, it will make monitoring and treatment better."
10750,But antivaxxers are going to kill a bunch more people with this info.
10751,Soon they will be vaccinating wild mink and wild deer

10764,I don't want to get COVID and have long-term health issues.
10765,Yeah if everyone had vaccines and we weren't worrying about people dying or getting severely ill that would be much better
10766,It absolutely is.

10769,I have a feeling that natural selection and Darwinism are finally catching up to humans.

10771,The UK recently said 40% of cases are breakthrough for them.

I don't think it's as high here in the US."
10773,"Mostly because our vaccination rate is lower, but partially because our vaccines are slightly better at preventing symptomatic infection (although, the evidence to claim that feels rather thin)."
10774,But really we (the US) have no clue.
10775,We're not looking.
10776,"Possibly an even bigger factor:  Vaccination, and being a responsible adult, are tightly coupled in the US."
10777,"So, the unvaccinated are the least likely to be making changes to their day to reduce risk of exposure."
10778,"Maybe that's also true in the UK, I'm guessing not as much?"
10779,They have a shorter contagious window because they are able to fend off infection faster.
10780,"Delta is contagious before symptoms whether or not you are vaccinated, so being vaccinated will not increase your potential to spread infection, especially when you consider that breakthrough infections are less common than unvaccinated infections."

10795,[removed]
10796,Unfortunately the CDC gets some of the blame because they didn't want to track breakthroughs that don't end up hospitalized or pass away (admittedly not easy) so at best you can maybe look at some smaller data sets.

10798,This has been predicted for 20+ years and it's never really happened.

10804,Someone good with science and statistics explain to me how this isn’t a death blow to converting anti-vaxxers.
10805,Twitter is on fire with them right now quoting this but I haven’t heard anything to put it into perspective.
10806,"This is a classic ""damned if you do, damned if you don't"" situation

China takes a very strict approach to controlling COVID, and media outlets blame them for being too draconian and stifling their economy (which IMO is a false dichotomy - solving a health crisis is how you boost the economy in the long-term)

But if China didn't do this, and instead cases (and deaths) were increasing rapidly, then those same media outlets will blame China for its inability to control cases, and how it's spreading COVID around the world"
10807,I'm not convinced on this point until we have better understanding and prevention of long covid.
10808,Could you imagine rolling a 3 sided dice for long term disability every time you got a cold or the flu.
10809,And being vaccinated might give you 1 in 5 odds.
10810,That's just not good enough for me to be convinced to go back to normal.
10811,If I risked those odds of brain damage instead of just being miserable for a few days every time I got a cold I'd sure as hell avoid catching it and avoid public places where people were spreading it.
10812,"No, because the hospitals are still filling up and they recently announced a state of emergency there."
10813,"Currently we have a mask mandate, 1 meter rule (3 feet), bars close at midnight, and no more than 200 people can come together."

10885,"Yeah, they'll shift the camps to Yemen or Syria."

10887,"More likely back to Afghanistan, given that this time the Taliban have had a massive influx of foreign fighters, potentially with Al Qaeda ties."
10888,"Given the rapid collapse of the Afghan government, would the CIA have been able to foster any assets in Afghanistan?"
10889,They'd have to rely on satellite imagery and the Pakistanis.

10901,"At the beginning they really didn't know if cotton masks were, but they did know that N95 masks and surgical masks were."
10902,"But due to the PPE shortage, they didn't want to encourage non-essential people to purchase actual medical supplies."
10903,"If they said ""cotton masks work"" and later discovered they were wrong, they'd be responsible for a lot of transmission."
10904,"If they said ""we don't know if cotton masks work, but we know medical ones do"", then people would have bought all of them."
10905,"Instead they told us to stay isolated instead of wear masks, because they didn't realize how confusing it would get."

1."
10924,Heavily increased vaccine production.

10967,They might outweigh that benefit *for you* or even for the average employee.
10968,But the question is whether they outweigh that benefit *for Apple*.

10979,Every day when new numbers come out you see the cases numbers for *previous* days go up.

11021,I am seeing this in Idaho a lot.
11022,"In the last  30 years, private hospitals have replaced county (government ones) with lower bed counts and fewer in-house services, and the price of healthcare has gone way up."

11031,"If Delta follows the pattern it took in other countries it will likely peak relatively fast and then numbers will begin to drop again, especially in areas with high vaccine uptake."
11032,"Remember, even in low vaccine uptake parts of the country the USA is still pretty highly vaccinated compared to most places in the world, and especially our over-65 population is pretty vaccinated."
11033,"If you want my personal opinion I think there will be another, much smaller wave in November-December-January that correlates with the holidays and people gathering inside more."
11034,"It will mirror the current one, where low-vaccine areas get hit harder, but will be much smaller than the current Delta surge."
11035,"And by the late winter/early spring (barring another, crazy variant) things will have mostly returned to normal most places in the USA because virtually everyone will have either been vaccinated or infected."
11036,"I think places in the USA will see rotating mask requirements and the like into early next year, but nothing will be universal and most places life will be mostly normal for the vast majority of people, especially once kids can get the shot (and hell, it already is many places... looking around where I'm at the social end of this pandemic happened in June when our governor lifted the mask mandate)."

11113,That is looking increasingly unlikely.
11114,The unthinkable happened.
11115,"New cases peaked at 54,183 on the 17th July, plummeted down to less than half this figure within the course of nine days, then they've been very slowly rising since."
11116,ZOE's data also suggests that symptomatic infections have dropped and remain stable at the moment.
11117,"It's quite ironic that out of all the other highly vaccinated nations, we've almost completely dropped our social distancing and mask mandates and haven't reimposed any restrictions since."

11138,The gift will help the people of HCM City and Bình Dương province which are the current largest COVID-19 hotspots in the country.

11147,You missed the quotation marks around “esteemed epidemiologist”.
11148,HCM CITY — Prime Minister Phạm Minh Chính has urged the country’s pandemic hotpot HCM City to impose its toughest COVID-19 prevention measures ever beginning on Monday as “everyone is asked to stay at home”.
11149,"Speaking at an online meeting on pandemic prevention late Thursday, PM Chính said the fight against the virus would focus on major roles played by ward and commune authorities."
11150,"“Everyone is asked to stay at home,” said PM Chính, adding that each ward or commune will ensure that  residents are supplied with food, essential items and accommodation."
11151,"The Prime Minister ordered the city to classify the pandemic situation in all 312 communes or wards according to three levels: green zone (COVID-free zone), red zone (extremely high-risk zone)  and yellow zone (high-risk zone)."
11152,The goal is to maintain and expand the green zones while isolating and reducing red and yellow zones.
11153,The PM has ordered the city to strictly implement Directive 16 by fulfilling six key tasks.
11154,"Firstly, the city must implement “thorough isolation between people, families, wards, and communes”."
11155,The police and army forces will be mobilised in case of a personnel shortage.
11156,"Second, the army will be responsible for providing food and essential items for people so that no one lacks food."
11157,"Thirdly, medical capacity will be enhanced, including more medical equipment (including oxygen supply), as well as nurses and doctors, to treat patients in communes and wards."
11158,The city must prepare emergency vehicles and emergency centres in each district to respond immediately when needed.
11159,"Treatment is on three levels: commune or ward level (mild or moderate symptoms), and district level and city level (more severe and critically ill cases)."
11160,The PM recommended that the city continue piloting home treatment of asymptomatic cases.
11161,Chính also ordered the Ministry of Health to research and determine whether a combination of oriental and western medicine is needed in order to minimise the number of deaths.
11162,"Fourth, the city must strengthen the police force to ensure security, order and safety for the people."
11163,"Fifth, the Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs will work closely to provide timely support to people in need of relief."
11164,Police forces at grassroots level will provide food to the homeless.
11165,"Sixth, the city will speed up testing under the guidance of the Ministry of Health with appropriate forms, including testing at home, and will detect cases in the community so the city can isolate and treat all COVID patients in a timely manner."
11166,The PM also asked the city to consider relocating certain people out of densely populated areas to reduce the number of cross-infections.
11167,This proposal is based on what northern provinces did in fighting a COVID outbreak.
11168,"The city should use military sites, schools and accommodation facilities for this purpose."
11169,PM Chính has assigned Deputy Prime Minister Phạm Bình Minh to be in charge of vaccine diplomacy.
11170,"Deputy Prime Minister Lê Minh Khái is in charge of logistics, finance, and allocation of national reserves, and Deputy Prime Minister Vũ Đức Đam pandemic prevention and healthcare issues."
11171,Deputy Prime Minister Lê Văn Thành is in charge of goods supply.
11172,"Since the fourth COVID wave began in April, HCM City has recorded about 165,000 cases."

11186,Uncertainty over quarantine rules and teaching plans for city public school students exposed to COVID-19 cases is sowing confusion weeks before kids return to class.
11187,"In-person public school classes start on Sept. 13, but Mayor de Blasio has not spelled out what criteria officials will use to decide when students must isolate at home after exposure to a coronavirus case in class, or how schools will instruct them during quarantine."
11188,The lack of clarity is ratcheting up stress levels for city parents worried about school disruptions.
11189,Educators are uncertain how they’ll continue teaching if rolling quarantines interrupt in-person classes.
11190,“I’m pretty sure at least a couple kids are going to be quarantined.
11191,"I think it would be better to plan for that now,” said Stacie Johnson, the parent of an elementary-schooler in Bushwick, Brooklyn."
11192,"“They should not be giving us crazy, last-minute changes."
11193,"Last year was a pretty stressful year.”


Some lawmakers and advocates have criticized the mayor’s decision to offer no remote option for students this school year."
11194,They argue such a system would allow students to keep learning while in temporary quarantine.
11195,"“That is really irresponsible and outrageous that it is Aug. 19 — principals who should be taking well-deserved time off are waiting for the mayor to kindly come up with a plan,” said City Council Member Mark Treyger (D-Brooklyn), who has called for the city to offer a virtual option for kids under 12 and immunocompromised students."
11196,"De Blasio has stayed steadfast in his refusal to continue full-time remote learning, citing the benefits of in-person classes for all kids and the low COVID-19 transmission last year in city schools."
11197,Building a citywide remote school would be a major undertaking of staffing and curriculum needs.
11198,"“I am absolutely convinced that with all the health and safety measures put in place, and a lot more vaccination that is going to happen between now and the opening day of school ... this [in-person school] is going to be the place that the kids need to be,” de Blasio said Thursday."
11199,But big logistical and health questions still remain about what in-person school will look like.
11200,Officials haven’t yet specified the criteria to determine when students need to quarantine after COVID exposure.
11201,"During much of last school year, city officials enforced a quarantine policy that most epidemiologists agreed was overly cautious, temporarily shuttering entire school buildings after two positive, unrelated cases cropped up within a week of each other."
11202,The protocol resulted in widespread back-and-forth closures.
11203,"The current rules, which were in effect for the city’s summer school, mandate 10-day quarantines for any unvaccinated students or staff sharing a classroom with someone infected."
11204,Vaccinated kids and teachers are not required to quarantine.
11205,Whole schools are closed only if there are four or more cases and officials conclude the virus was transmitted in the school.
11206,"As of Thursday, 266 individual classrooms across the nearly 800 sites offering summer school programs were closed for temporary quarantines, according to DOE data."
11207,De Blasio suggested Tuesday that the city will continue with the standard of exempting vaccinated kids and adults from mandatory quarantine.
11208,DOE officials did not immediately respond to a question about whether the city will adopt CDC guidance allowing even unvaccinated kids sharing a room with an infected classmate to forego quarantine as long as both kids were wearing masks — a measure that would likely cut down significantly on the number of kids required to isolate at home.
11209,Then there’s the question of how schools will continue teaching kids forced to quarantine.
11210,"Several districts across the country have committed to teaching quarantined students online, while others say they’ll livestream in-person classes."
11211,"Other districts plan to send kids home with paper packets, according to a recent review by Chalkbeat."
11212,Treyger worries that schools will be saddled with extra work and produce uneven results without coordinated help or guidance from the city on how to instruct kids in quarantine.
11213,"Johnson, the Bushwick parent, said she hopes there will at least be some time during the school day her daughter can receive remote instruction from her regular teacher if she’s in quarantine."
11214,"“You’d think there would be a way to jiggle that around … that there would at least be an hour where the teacher could log on with the kids who are home,” she said."
11215,De Blasio said Thursday that there will be more details on plans to teach kids in quarantine in the coming days.
11216,"Keep an eye on /r/COVID19, they're pretty keen on upvoting J&amp;J studies."
11217,"Yeah I’m just saying be careful making statements like “we’re learning how many people really don’t care about their kids,” when at least some percentage of those parents did all the right things."

11290,"If it's random, then your concerns are more justified."
11291,So this is a monoclonal antibody treatment from Regeneron.
11292,Is it significantly different or better than the Regeneron mAb cocktail that’s been used in the US since last fall?
11293,It says it can be injected or infused whereas the one here in the US requires infusion.

11310,Still thinking of those 4 glorious weeks where LA didn’t have a mask mandate.
11311,I miss her.
11312,In the UK our excess death figure is just over half of the official Covid death figure.
11313,80k vs 131k.
11314,So I actually think our death rate is the other way around due to Covid killing people who might have died from other causes.
11315,This is an example of why masks are a very important component to finding our way out of this.
11316,It IS pay and all that comes with it.
11317,Onetime 10k has no longevity.
11318,not like we couldn't have prevented this or anything...
11319,Interesting theory since a lot of Republicans are working class.
11320,You can't disregard the study because it is a small n. Do you understand how confidence intervals work?
11321,They are in the paper and reflect the small sample size.
11322,Go read the paper again and look at the confidence intervals.

Really impossible to say without further science."

11334,Need moral support.
11335,"My partner and I are covid vaccinated, me with Moderna and he with Pfizer, but everyone else (5 other people) in this household are sick covid + 2 are confirmed positive."

11350,"So… based on the numbers, that would mean that 71% of unvaccinated adults got COVID?"
11351,That’s a staggering number.

11367,"I know the risk is small but I already suffer from heart palpitations due to anxiety and I really don't want any more issues with my heart, and I'm not really one to take chances so even a 1/10000 chance is very worrying for me."
11368,"I know J&amp;J has the blood clot issue but it's  probably a much lower risk, more like 1/1000000 for me personally which I am comfortable with."

11392,We love our NHS.

11394,Just 4% of UK want NHS privatised.

11426,CDC reports 74% of breakthrough hospitalizations deaths are over 65?

11484,Does this mean that we should be testing both vaccinated and unvaccinated people frequently as well?
11485,From what I read some months ago there was concern about myocarditis in younger men that received Pfizer in Israel.
11486,I wonder if the new finding is associated with the comparatively larger dose given for Moderna vs Pfizer.
11487,I wouldn’t be surprised to find that more effective vaccination will come from multiple smaller doses delivered over a longer period.
11488,Are there other vaccines that behave this way?

11511,It's time to start considering whether it's time to start the conversation on whether we should consider the reality that there may be a possibility that we may one day need a booster.
11512,"This is an important point - as vaccination rates approach saturation, more and more of the hospitalizations will be from those who are vaccinated."
11513,My fully vaccinated wife ended up getting COVID in June.
11514,"I too am fully vaccinated, and she never transmitted the virus to me, which tells me the vaccine worked on two levels:

1."
11515,"It completely protected me from infection
2."
11516,It reduced the severity of my wife's own infection.
11517,"She still got sick (and was already immunocompromised), but never had to be hospitalized."
11518,"She probably got it from our unvaccinated 10 year old daughter, who came down with the virus a few days before my wife."
11519,"Well, considering 1/2 of the US adult population is vaccinated, and a VAST majority of Covid deaths are NOT vaccinated, I think you'd be wrong."
11520,They only said they got their first dose in January.
11521,Why wouldn't that be safe?
11522,Not at all.
11523,I expect people to wear masks during a pandemic.

11552,"The article says the guy was already vaccinated, but still got very sick."
11553,That was not at all what the WHO said.
11554,"They said ""WHO is calling for a moratorium on boosters until at least the end of September, to enable at least 10% of the population of every country to be vaccinated."""
11555,"From that same announcement:

&gt; But we cannot accept countries that have already used most of the global supply of vaccines using even more of it, while the world’s most vulnerable people remain unprotected."
11556,"&gt; In late May, I called for global support for a “sprint to September”, to enable every country to vaccinate at least 10% of its population by the end of September."
11557,"&gt; We’re now more than halfway to that target date, but we’re not on track."

11600,"Countries with a 3 month gap between first and second shots (UK) aren't seeing the decline at all yet,  which is promising for what happens after the third shot."

11602,Don’t know why u were downvoted for this.
11603,But I share the same sentiment as well.
11604,Why would I trust my safety from someone who doesn’t believe in science either ways.
11605,I don’t even think that half of the people that join the police department are there to actually protect and serve a community.

11684,I got the vaccine because I didn't want to spread the disease to people who are vulnerable.
11685,Now this all appears to be for naught.

of COVID are almost non-existent."
11697,"Why should it be approved and enforced

 covid?"

11908,FEMA can set up mass vaccination sites.
11909,Get Alabama all the vaccine they need to get everybody their shots.
11910,boosters?
11911,is this the first time you get vaccinated?
11912,I've had 3 shots of several vaccines for other diseases.
11913,We've known this since the spring of 2020.
11914,It's not even new with Delta.
11915,It's the reason why hygiene theater doesn't contain it.
11916,"Only mass testing, masking, proper ventilation and capacity limits help stop spread."
11917,Covid is a brilliant disease in that it turns all of our assumptions and procedures for containing infectious disease upside down.
11918,It really takes advantage of the blind spots in our collective thoughts and habits.
11919,That means squat when talking cases.
11920,All that matters is total population vaccinated.
11921,i don’t know what ur tryna say.
11922,I’m vaccinated and have continued to take precautionary measures.
11923,My point was ur very unlikely to get skeptical people to do the same when they have a low risk of dying and  u deliberately hide numbers or mislead people in a political manner as the cdc has done repeatedly
11924,Ask Gov Abbott
11925,&gt;Dyer explained that many COVID-19 patients require liquid oxygen for their treatment.
11926,OUC has used liquid oxygen to treat the water supply for years.
11927,&gt;Nationally and locally the demand for liquid oxygen is high as COVID-19 has surged and many have not been vaccinated.
11928,&gt;Dyer said there could be impacts to the water quality if the city doesn't reduce the amount of water we need to treat.
11929,Isn’t that good though?
11930,If they feel fine then the number of cases isn’t as daunting.
11931,Nope!
11932,My fully vaccinated mum can't visit me from the UK directly but if she hangs out in a high risk country like Mexico or Turkey for two weeks then it's totally fine!
11933,Site the study please.
11934,Is this a peer reviewed study?
11935,Is it the only one?
11936,"Long covid has been shown to be blown out of proportion by those who have been vaccinated, and not taken seriously enough by those who aren't vaccinated."
11937,"Meaning, it's somewhere in between."
11938,"Not as grave a risk as everyone makes out, but still serious enough that you need to get the vaccine."
11939,"For those keeping track of stats on Worldmeters and seeing a sharp decline in deaths in Florida over the past 2 weeks:

6 days ago, Florida's 7-day moving average of deaths peaked on August 5th with a sharp decline right after."
11940,"Today, the 7-day moving average shows that it peaked even higher, on August 8th (at 148 deaths) with a sharp decline right after."
11941,"So it seems Florida is regularly reporting low number of deaths every day, then quietly updating those numbers weeks later."
11942,Dead-first would be more appropriate.
11943,Very sad!
11944,Without vaccine mandate you mean.
11945,Lollapalooza didn't seem to have an issue.
11946,"Az has been pretty much shelved in most of Europe, it's relatively high risk of blood clots in younger people means that it's only recommend for older people here."
11947,"On top of that new studies showed that it's less effective than Pfizer/Moderna, so many European countries now recomend that people who are waiting for their second AZ dose get Pfizer instead."
11948,And even long before that there were delays in deliveries to the EU.
11949,"I guess they never felt like they could completely fulfill US orders, so they didn't file for approval and then the EU stopped using it..."

11951,Greetings from sunny (stormy) Florida!
11952,Our winter came early and it’s a shit show.
11953,We currently have two temperatures… the surface of the sun or the worst storm you’ve ever seen.
11954,Usually both in the same day.
11955,So we are all inside all the time.
11956,Add all the fuckwads who live here and we are currently breaking new covid records daily.
11957,I can’t wait for winter where the rainy season ends and the air is dry and tolerable so I can be outside and enjoy life again.
11958,"Unfortunately, it's not that unusual."
11959,Many countries have had excess deaths that considerably exceed reported covid deaths.
11960,This can be seen in [the tracker](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/coronavirus-excess-deaths-tracker) by The Economist.
11961,"Note that many countries lack detailed historical death reports, meaning that we have no way of knowing excess death or can only guestimate it."
11962,"Among others, that's the case for most African and several Asian countries."
11963,"The actual infection is estimated to be closer to 800k

https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america?view=infections-testing&amp;tab=trend&amp;test=infections"
11964,Idk.
11965,This was back before shit really hit the fan.
11966,The VP recently had a follow up meeting with everyone and just reiterated this shit.
11967,"I know this is sort of off-topic, but I'd love to know how old you are, to have a worldview which includes ""having 100 contacts."""
11968,:D
11969,"flu vaccine starts at less than 50% effective, iirc"
11970,My thought as well.
11971,I don't care what your religious beliefs are (or aren't).
11972,I support and defend everyone's rights to believe or not believe.
11973,"However, your religious beliefs can't include the right to put me at risk."
11974,Don't want to wear a mask or get vaccinated because of religion?
11975,Fine.
11976,Just don't expect to use that as a free pass to expose and endanger others.
11977,What kind of sick religious belief would that be anyway?
11978,What does this have to do with a private university mandating vaccine?
11979,"Those Rice students who are vaccinated, are they in the hospital?"
11980,wouldn't those questions be best answered by the specialist?/
11981,And this is how the collapse of a civilization starts.
11982,"Unfortunately, people who are vaccinated can still get sick."
11983,"And it’s not legal or ethical to deny care to the unvaccinated in favor of treating those who were responsible and got the vaccine, even though it’s incredibly frustrating."
11984,"I had a patient admitted last night, and though his hypoxic brain may have clouded his judgement, he made sure to tell me (between labored breaths) that he wanted to decline the vaccine."
11985,I am finding myself to be far less compassionate this time around.
11986,"I am aware of it, and I can’t change it, and frankly I am starting to question my profession at this point."
11987,"The facility I work for decided to make vaccination mandatory, and for a week it’s been nothing but conspiracy theories and rights this and freedoms that."
11988,The nursing staff is probably 50% unvaccinated and it’s so hard to listen to day in and day out.
11989,Snowboarding will be my savior
11990,I think it depends where you are.
11991,Someone likened being vaccinated in a low vaccinated area as being a wet log in a fire.
11992,Probably not a bad analogy.....
11993,The hospitals should just start turning unvaccinated people away.
11994,Don't trust the doctors to prevent you from getting sick?
11995,Don't trust them to heal you.

12003,Or you could just get the vaccine in spare yourself all of this.
12004,They use the oxygen to create ozone to disinfect the water.
12005,It's a better approach than using chlorine for disinfecting water.
12006,"I also have it, double vaccinated - it's a mild cold at best."
12007,"Not the demon it's made out to be, for me, personally."
12008,"Now a lot of people are getting very sick and dying, and I don't dispute that."
12009,BUt for me and you it wasn't a big deal.
12010,"Delta is more fatal because it attaches better and is harder for the body to fight,  so it lasts longer."
12011,Even in the vaccinated.
12012,"In that longer duration, it continues to spread."
12013,You should try using a nice dry flower vaporizer - I find that smoking it hits me real hard and I get very anxious until I come down a bit.
12014,A vape high is a lot smoother and clear headed.
12015,But everyone is different.
12016,I'm fairly certain the vaccines being used on the zoo animals aren't human vaccines.
12017,&gt; But Israel paid a price for the early rollout.
12018,"Health officials, and then Pfizer, said their data showed a dip in the vaccine's protection around six months after receiving the second shot."
12019,Waning vaccine efficacy is hard to prove.
12020,The confound is that the dominant strains now are more easily transmissible.
12021,"So, are infections rising because vaccine effectiveness is waning, or is it because of newer variants?"
12022,It's difficult to tease apart the causality.
12023,The essential oils industry will be booming!
12024,"That seems... Not wildly unreasonable, although I don't know the evidence that well."
12025,"I think my preference would be for occasional sub-infectious nasal colonizations that kept my antibodies topped up, although I'm also fine with frequent vaccine boosters."
12026,"Good news, bad news I'd say."
12027,"On the side of good:

1)DNA is more stable than RNA, and storage should be less of a problem."
12028,2)A DNA vaccine can be produced quicker and at a lower cost than an RNA one.
12029,"Bad news:

1)Unlike an RNA vaccine a DNA one has to get not just into the cell but also into the cell's nucleus."
12030,"This may be connected with...

2)This vaccine seems to be less immunogenic than the RNA products."
12031,"The article reports that the manufacturer recommends three doses  rather than two

3) There is a possibility that the DNA in the plasmid may integrate into the genome of the patient."
12032,"Plasmids are, in fact, one of the tools fo doing just that in genetic engineering."
12033,In this case the effects of plasmid/patient DNA integration are unknown.
12034,Perhaps none.
12035,Perhaps a great effect.
12036,For real - I got my card just this past May.
12037,"If things get bad again, at least there'll be weed this time."
12038,"But what if I'm fully vaccinated, don't give a shit about what happens to people who choose not to be vaccinated, AND have kids who are unable to be vaccinated?"
12039,I need to know how to feel.
12040,&gt; OUC has used liquid oxygen to treat the water supply for years.
12041,&gt; Dyer said there could be impacts to the water quality if the city doesn't reduce the amount of water we need to treat.
12042,"In Isreal about half of hospitalizations are vaccinated folks, they have nationally very very good vaccination rates (80%)."
12043,"I am 100% agreeing that getting vaccinated is needed and obvious, its like wearing a mask in public."
12044,But at this point doing all these things still wont protect you completely unless a new booster vaccine gets developed.
12045,The virus is winning at this point sadly.
12046,"At the rate we are going in this country, we are going to need Doctors Without Borders."
12047,[deleted]
12048,What does water have to do with liquid oxygen?
12049,"(I can't read the article, unfortunately it tells me it is ""not available in your region""...)"

12051,I live in Moscow.
12052,"Delta variant is ravaging the country, we've had around 800 confirmed Covid-19 deaths a day for the past month and a half (and those are government stats, and we all know about those)."
12053,"With that being said, barely anybody wears masks (I feel like people look at me as a weirdo when they see me wear one), vaccination levels are low AF despite there being a vaccine readily available (you can get vaccinated in a mall)."
12054,I'm so mad!
12055,That's a great opinion and I'm not disparanging it.
12056,I'd rather have the opposite.
12057,I'd rather get mild covid over and over to avoid the really nasty disease.
12058,"We know the vaccines are wearing off, we know the latest strain has broken through - the best case scenario is to get mild covid every 6 months to keep the antibodies in your system (and keep the immune system primed)."
12059,So if a rocket scientist doesn’t want the vax I’m sure there are a lot of other people that are qualified to do the job just waiting at Home Depot
12060,[removed]
12061,It doesn't fit the narrative of tell everyone to get the vaccine at all times no matter what and that is the only thing that will help end the pandemic.
12062,It is pretty amazing to me that people want to focus on this vaccine so much and rapid testing so little.
12063,"With rapid testing, people can do any activity with negligible risk, especially compared to vaccines that allow spread."
12064,"This isn't to say vaccines are bad, or useless, they're very useful, especially for at risk populations."
12065,But they're not the golden ticket to end the pandemic
12066,/r/Masks4All has a list of reputable sellers.
12067,"I learned about triage in the Vietnam era, genius."
12068,"And I know medical ethics, which you don't."
12069,"There is no ethical reason to withhold ICU treatment from unvaccinated COVID patients, vs vaccinated COVID patients."
12070,"By the time the disease has progressed to that point the benefit of vaccination has passed, and there are equal outcomes."
12071,The Delta variant is pointing away from the earlier idea of developing herd immunity - people need to get vaccinated.
12072,"DeSantis is pushing costly monoclonal antibodies, but that is unlikely to confer immunity for subsequent infection."
12073,[Will the spread of the Delta variant prevent herd immunity?
12074,"](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/has-the-delta-variant-of-sars-cov-2-made-herd-immunity-impossible)  
&gt;However, the head of the Oxford Vaccine Group, Prof. Andrew Pollard, says herd immunity is “not a possibility” given how transmissible the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 is."
12075,This one sounds kinda apocalyptic.
12076,"So actually  

\- few hospitalizations *(on the uotpic \~100% treeshold)* 

\- few deaths

\- still too many cases *(we'd get it and survive)*"

12094,Haven't we known that COVID-19 is spread by aerosols since like last year?
12095,[removed]
12096,It's hysteria again.
12097,Look at the actual figures.
12098,"Mortality over a year IF this month's deaths continue at the same rate would be 5 in 10,000, much less than Influenza."
12099,"178 serious illnesses in 100,000 for unvaccinated people, less than a 1/5 of 1 percent of the population, less for vaccinated."
12100,These are the important figures not the presence of a virus in asymptomatic people.
12101,"Sorry, thought this would be pretty obvious but I'll explain it anyway."
12102,"If the majority of people in a given town are not wearing masks or practicing social distancing (especially if it's 10:1 like we saw in some places), you can be pretty damned sure COVID Delta variant is running wild in their town."
12103,"When you find yourself in a place like this, it's really stupid to go to a restaurant where you're forced to remove your mask, in closed quarters, for an extended period of time, with a bunch of people who are not protecting themselves."
12104,I did explain that I wasn't talking about the people who were pregnant before this whole thing started.
12105,They had no idea and I felt really bad for them when everything blew up.
12106,:(
12107,I mean if somebody coughs or sneezes right at them then most of the droplets will hit the divider.
12108,It’s the same reason that these are used at salad bars and buffets.
12109,It’s not going to stop aerosols but it could be the difference between inhaling hundreds or thousands of viral particles over the course of a day instead of millions in one shot.
12110,I literally said that in my post.
12111,"""it just slows down the transmission rate""."
12112,Very misleading headline.
12113,"The full quote is this:

""Sending unmasked, unvaccinated kids into a poorly ventilated classroom is like holding the world's largest chickenpox party, **except instead of chickenpox it is the third-leading cause of death last year**”"
12114,Maybe it is time to bring back social distancing.
12115,"Cuba has plenty of faults, but they do have a good healthcare system."
12116,"A friend that works in a hospital here in the Portland area txted this to me last night...""In other news ...we are almost out of ICU beds and need to open another COVID unit in the hospital...national guard is coming in too."
12117,"And we may be getting patients transferred in from other hospitals in Oregon that are completely over run"""
12118,That's my personal prediction too barring something unforeseen.
12119,"My personal prediction: 

The places that got hit by Delta first will see their peaks and then drops while other areas of the country see their waves."
12120,Things calm down a bit before the next winter wave.
12121,"Meanwhile, the vaccines will get full approval along with the 5-11 age group also being approved in the fall."
12122,Booster shots also start rolling out to high risk groups first and then to the rest of the population.
12123,Expect more vaccine mandates to start coming as well.

12166,"(Aside from states like Ohio that specifically passed laws in the past couple months that forbid mandates for anything under EUA)

With that said, everyone wrongly assumed that everyone would just get the vaccine and everything would take care of itself."
12167,There was no reason to mandate anything.

12212,"The rise won't be nearly as bad as it will in the YOLO parts of the state (especially the northern, rural areas mentioned in the article, which are rabidly conservative, a la State of Jefferson)."
12213,My county in California has 89% vaccination rate for people over 60.
12214,I was anticipating COVID to reduce water demand.
12215,[removed]
12216,City water in Florida is awful.
12217,"Aquifer water is actually really tasty, but it is as hard as a rock (tons of sediment) and cannot be softened."
12218,"Dude, are you seriously blaming maskless vaccinated people for spreading to unvaccinated people?"
12219,Did you forget to put a /s at the end of your post?
12220,&gt; You stated that vaccines do little to prevent the spread of the delta variant.
12221,"&gt; 
&gt; That is 100% false."
12222,The vaccine does a lot to prevent spread of delta.
12223,As much as the other variants?
12224,"No but it does a lot, don’t under play it."
12225,Poorly worded statements like that only fuel idiotic anti vaxxers.
12226,Here I copied the other posters very correct and factual response since you seem to not understand anything unless it's drilled into your head 100 times.
12227,"Sucks for the workers, no doubt, but many Midwestern states say get vaccinated or subject yourself to one or two tests a week."
12228,Tests maybe in a slump but that’s probably the extent.
12229,"See page 10: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1007511/S1327_Short_Long_COVID_report.pdf

I encourage you to read the full report; you can see it is a meta-analysis of many other studies, including the REACT and CONVALESCENCE studies."
12230,IMO this is the best collection of all the evidence we have on long covid right now.
12231,"Can you please cite the study(s) that have ""shown [long covid] to be blown out of proportion by those who have been vaccinated, and not taken seriously enough by those who aren't vaccinated""?"
12232,I have yet to see something like this and would love to read it.
12233,[removed]
12234,We are in diversion a lot.
12235,"That means we can’t accept transfers and we don’t allow the ambulances to come to us, but we cannot do anything about the people who walk into our ED."
12236,There is no medical evidence that vaccinated people whose COVID has advanced to the point of needing ICU care have better outcomes than unvaccinated.
12237,All the evidence so far shows that the benefit of vaccines is in avoiding severe disease.
12238,"There is no benefit once the disease has become severe, the outcomes are the same for vaccinated vs unvaccinated."
12239,"I am truly on the side of the ""science"" and recognize that COVID is a moving target and so the best advice is going to change as more is known because that is the nature of the scientific method."
12240,However I am getting frustrated at the garbled messaging of the CDC.
12241,It reminds me of the early days of the pandemic when we were advised that masks were unnecessary - and that was because they knew masks were unavailable and PPE needed to be conserved for front line workers.
12242,"However, as soon as reports of the first break through cases started appearing I immediately assumed that it was going to turn out to be worse than was initially reported."
12243,"And I essentially went back to my pre-vaccination life style of being fully masked with KN95, going out only for essential stuff and essentially isolating within my pod of people who I trust in terms of being risk adverse."
12244,I cancelled some minor repair work two weeks ago because I thought - who the F wants to contracting COVID in order to hang my new ceiling fixture.
12245,"And as it turns out my caution proved to be prophetic as it is increasingly evident that there are significant numbers of breakthrough cases - and even if not hospitalized or dead - some of them become very ill. 

What seems uncertain is what the booster shot will accomplish."
12246,Will increased markers mean one is safer from breakthroughs?
12247,I have read that the third shot could be like the hepatitis vaccine which requires three jabs for full immunity but that immunity is quite long lived.
12248,"On the other hand, I don't think hepatitis mutates and creates variants the way COVID does or the flu."
12249,Literally my second guess.
12250,San Francisco never had high rates.
12251,Its probably the city with the fewest cases per capita in the entire country.
12252,That would be amazing.
12253,I'd love to have my kids fully vaccinated by the holidays/winter season.
12254,Jokes on you I already have anxiety

12256,"From my understanding, the president can only override state government by declaring martial law."
12257,"I know that is going extreme, but unless we nip this, perhaps it's an option?"
12258,At least so that we can put the state leaders in check
12259,[removed]
12260,I don't quite understand this line of logic.
12261,"In the long term a disease will be adversely affected by a high mortality rate, which accompanied by scientific advancement is why there aren't many very deadly viruses."
12262,On the short term however I don't see much evolutionary stress to not kill the host.
12263,"Imagine a hypothetical, imagine a disease emerged a thousand years ago in a small native now extinct mole species."
12264,That virus had a similar profile to corona with a few weeks of high contagiousness followed by 100% death rate.
12265,"From an evolutionary perspective that disease is likely doomed to fail and not persist, but from a random mutation perspective i dont see any reason why either increased or decreased mortality is likely to exist."
12266,Jesus.
12267,"I know Idaho has a lower COL, but I can't imagine only paying a nurse $11/hr for what they deal with."
12268,I hope you found better employment elsewhere.
12269,I would not be surprised if there are currently millions infected.
12270,They might mean in terms of time.
12271,There are a lot of people who feel they literally can’t afford to lose a day of work if they have any side effects.
12272,And they may not be able to take time off to get the shot at all.
12273,Every company should be offering paid leave for these appointments and any side effects.
12274,Oh man this winter is gonna be tough
12275,", anxiety indeed"
12276,Vaccine-wise we’re doing great.
12277,On track for 72% vaccinated in the next week or so.
12278,"Hospital-wise, we’ve got the biggest in the state, so we’re slammed."

12281,Doesn't she understand that when they said kids are less affected virus they were referring to 1+ years?
12282,"Newborns absolutely can get sick and die, there was an article recently where twins in Texas died of COVID."
12283,I have been vaccinated since I believe March Or April and as soon as everything opened up I was out and about like everywhere and I know was exposed to a lot of people who had COVID but not once did I get it.
12284,But just recently like 3-4 weeks ago I came down with a cold wasn't really bad but just took a long time to get over was just runny nose &amp; congestion nothing bad.
12285,"I get over it a week later i go visit my nieces as they started school a day later I came down with a nasty virus literally had me in bed for 4 days high fever, sever headache, severe fatigue it was bad got tested for covid twice but came out negative."
12286,Like it's crazy how these lil kids carry so much nasty things :( teachers need to be really teaching these kids to wash their hand and how important it is
12287,"Those people are in Union, which is Eastern and incidentally one of the surge counties."

12290,"But they are talking about non-covid issues, like people having heart attacks and other emergencies."
12291,"I remember reading about a man who needed urgent bladder surgery in December sitting in the ER for hours waiting for a bed, only to code as he was being wheeled into the ambulance for transport."
12292,"When all the beds are filled with covid patients, everyone who needs help suffers."
12293,When is the time for (mainly) americans to start to have an adult discussion regarding masks?
12294,"Imo (as a swede) its obviously security theatre, just the same as you are not allowed more than 100ml of fluids on an airplane and no nail clippers."
12295,"Its about you as an individual feeling safe, it seems to have nothing to do with actual terrorism or in the case of masks, infectivity."
12296,You may remove the mask to eat and drink.
12297,That alone shows that its just theatre.
12298,The evidence for masks is weak at best.
12299,"Sweden has had no masks for the entirety of the pandemic, no lockdown either, while it has been worse than nordic neighbours (mainly because covid got into elderly care, caused by swedish labor market regarding elderly care which is a can of worms suited for another discussion), we are at worst on par with any american state."
12300,"Masks are traditionally used in healthcare to protect the patient, often with open wounds, from droplets form the caregiver."
12301,"Having a surgical mask in your pocket, or hanging from your mirror in your car, is very very far from how masks are traditionally used."
12302,Any medical worker can attest to the difference in how they have been used in a hospital compared to the theatre being performed by the average citizen.
12303,"Im fully vaccinated, havent worn a mask except when forced to (international travel) and so far has not been infected."
12304,Denmark (afaik) has removed any and all requirements for masks because the evidence just isnt there
12305,I have heard way too many people say their doctors have never heard of SSRI withdrawal.
12306,At this point I think the doctors are just saying this to take away any negative feelings of taking the drugs.
12307,"Only problem is it seems like patients should be fully informed, and it's not like the internet and books don't exist."
12308,"From the article:

&gt; Perhaps the lack of clarity is due to the medical ethics of withholding potentially life-saving surgery from patients expressing some level of bodily and medical autonomy?"
12309,&gt;Maybe it’s unwise to establish a policy on a vaccine that hasn’t yet been given full approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
12310,Are there legal ramifications for that?
12311,&gt;The doctor shouldn’t dictate every decision of a patient.
12312,"Instead, they should make good-faith efforts to educate a patient on a course of action."
12313,It’s also disturbing to apply this policy to someone on the transplant list before COVID existed.
12314,How is that ethical?

12328,Possibly.
12329,But as quickly as we are learning things how can we be sure for any amount of time?
12330,"I am not saying to disregard your links or science, just that we are all figuring this out daily."
12331,"It seems completely believable that a vaxxed person might ignore or not have symptoms and then even if contagious only for a few days... that could be worse than an unvaccinated person getting sick and quarantining... A vaccinated person could still technically create something like a superspreader event with something like this delta variant if right place right time, right?"
12332,"In other words, anything can happen and if we really want to both unite people against this thing AND also prevent the spread of Covid in high risk areas/gatherings, I personally think that this ""prove vaccination OR prove a negative test"" to stand next to another few 1,000 people somewhere is a little off the mark and maybe even a bad idea."
12333,"It both segregates &amp; angers some people right out of the gate, and also goes out of the way to leave an opening for a vaccinated person with Covid who is still contagious."
12334,It is literally easy to avoid both of those fallacies.
12335,"Sure maybe there is less or more chance of whatever here or there, but if you don't want Covid at your event, just ask everyone to show a negative test."
12336,Keep it simple and uniform for all.
12337,Probably there is a reason that doesn't make sense.
12338,But that's my two cents.
12339,Yeah people have to realize that bumping this person means another person moves up on the list.
12340,"If that person has a much better chance of survival, it just makes sense."
12341,I wish they would impose mask mandates.
12342,"&gt;New hospital is just for the influx of covid patients 

You’re missing the part where there’s already not enough staff to man beds."
12343,What’s the point in building a new hospital that would essentially become a shitty hostel for patients?
12344,"I understand the dilemma with firing unvaccinated medical staff would exasperate the staffing issue in some way, but having unvaxxed staff to begin with isnt helping the situation at all..

&gt;Nothing is going to solve that

Vaccine mandates would be an EXTREMELY effective tool to combat spread and minimizing the need for ICUs, considering that’s what their main job is."
12345,"Unfortunately with wide spread community transmission because of a low vaccination rate, breakthrough cases are becoming more and more common because none of the vaccines provide sterilizing immunity (not very many vaccines in existence do provide that)"
12346,"Well...first order style, then."
12347,"You seem to forgotten the majority that just have a standard, mild case of Covid and move on."
12348,"From Wikipedia-

Before 2020, no mRNA technology platform (drug or vaccine) had been authorized for use in humans, so there was a risk of unknown effects."
12349,The person writhing in pain on the ground is likely not vaccinated.
12350,You’re incredibly unlikely to get to that state where you’re sprawled out on the ground if you’re vaccinated.
12351,That’s how the husband is doing the taking of pictures and not joining them on the floor.
12352,considering a very very large majority of people that died had comorbidities or were seniors ur chance of death is probably lower than that unless u are a part of these two groups of course

12397,"It is reasonable for actual medical exclusions (from vaccination) being given priority as normal; but, just like if someone can't quit drinking would exclude a person from getting a liver or kidney - not getting vaccinated by choice should exclude one from getting any organ."
12398,"Organs are prioritized based on personal behavior and other similar factors all the time - so that they do the most good, giving the most potential ""life"" to others."
12399,People who want to roll the dice with Covid instead of doing the sane thing and mitigating some of the risk - who will also be very susceptible to complications (more so than normal/average) - are just simply a bad bet when it comes to that remaining potential life span.
12400,Exactly.
12401,I saw one nurse tweeting online saying how a patient in ICU had refused her vaccine because they didn't know what was in the vaccine.
12402,"The nurse told the patient ""I've just pumped 7 different expensive drugs in you and not once did you ever question what's in them."""

12453,"First of all, we were talking about the hypothetical societal impact of potential long term cognitive effects of covid."
12454,So your reply in general is off topic.
12455,"But anyways

&gt;Yes, this is better than opening up prematurely (before herd immunity) and ending up with a massive surge like the US is having now."
12456,&gt;China is performing at the very top on the economic side precisely because they don't need to lock down massive numbers of people every time the ICUs are full like here.
12457,"I don't live in the US, but anyway, the US has been recovering economically better and faster than most other countries in the world, including New Zealand."
12458,"And also: you just told me that the US is not having lockdowns and not containing therefore has a massive surge...but then you tell me China doesn't have to lock down massive numbers of people every time the ICUs are full, unlike the US...which is *not* locking down massive numbers of people?"
12459,I would even go as far as saying that the average American living outside a few pockets (especially NYC and the Bay Areas) has been subject to fewer restrictions overall since last summer than the average Chinese.
12460,Or not significantly more at least.
12461,The first lockdown was also significantly less strict.
12462,&gt;The cost of testing and containment is clearly less than the cost of having to shut down their economy.

12478,"Vaccinated people wearing masks doesn't stop unvaccinated people from getting Covid, it just slows down the transmission rate (the old 2 weeks to bend the curve mantra)."
12479,"Also, people need to be realistic with the mask mandates."
12480,"Here in Washington DC, there is a mask mandate, but it isn't required in bars/night clubs and restaurants since people are eating/drinking."
12481,Even the mayor didn't wear a mask while sitting at a table even while not eating/drinking.
12482,"So, masking does reduce transmission rates a bit, but it isn't going to just stop transmission."
12483,Great!

12494,The question is if it works for vaccinated people at all.
12495,Or rather if they should get it.
12496,Studies on Regeneron have proven that it is only really effective if given around the onset of symptoms.
12497,"Since the vaccine already has over 90% effectiveness at preventing hospitalisation, it makes no sense to give it to a person who was vaccinated, because they most likely will be fine without it (and by the time you'd notice that they needed it it's too late to administer it...)."
12498,"Even with this surge in availability, those antibodies are a finite resource and should be given to those most likely to benefit, and that would be people who are hight risk, unvaccinated and very early in their illness."

12506,"well too late now, perhaps when he recovers"
12507,That was my thought on MS requesting a hospital ship...issue a state wide mask mandate and you can have the f'ing ship...but without the mandate it would just be throwing a water balloon at a wild fire.
12508,It's because your tolerance went away/way down.

12549,"Rice University, a private institution in Houston, has done its best to build a wall against the Delta variant that is engulfing the state of Texas."
12550,"Unlike the state’s public universities, which cannot mandate vaccines or masks, Rice has imposed stringent requirements for being on campus."
12551,It requires student and faculty members to wear masks and has testing protocols for all visitors.
12552,"And while not specifically requiring vaccines and risking running afoul of Texas law, it has told students they were expected to be vaccinated."
12553,"Still, the virus has surged in Houston, and on Thursday, Rice became the second university in the state to shift classes online, dampening hopes for a return to normal college life this fall."
12554,The university delayed the start of school by two days until Aug. 25 and said that classes would remain online through Sept. 3.
12555,It also said that members of the Rice community had tested positive for Covid despite the high vaccination rates — 98.5 percent — among the student body.
12556,"“I’ll be blunt: the level of breakthrough cases (positive testing among vaccinated persons) is much higher than anticipated,” Bridget Gorman, the dean of undergraduates, wrote in a letter to the school’s 8,000 graduate and undergraduate students."
12557,The university didn’t specify how many breakthrough cases there were.
12558,"More than 12,000 people are hospitalized with the coronavirus in Texas, where officials have prohibited both masks and vaccine mandates, and where Gov."
12559,Greg Abbott recently tested positive.
12560,"“We’re in a hot spot right now,” said Rice’s president, David Leebron, adding that the decision to move temporarily to remote classes was made to give the university time to assess the results of its recent testing."
12561,"“Having new information of concern, as people worry about breakthrough infections, as people with children are worried around those issues, we wanted to have a little bit of time to gather data and look at it more carefully,” he said."

12602,"What will likely happen is this: A lot of normal things (shopping, restaurants, ect) haven't required a negative test or proof of vaccination because the cases are so low."
12603,These things will start requiring an official negative COVID test like before or proof of vaccination.
12604,"If you're vaccinated, this is a non issue because you just show a certificate on your phone."

12633,The day after Gavin newsom survives the recall we will probably get a statewide mandate.
12634,He is an extremely close recall and people outside of LA and SF don’t want to wear masks.
12635,"So if he makes the mandate before the election, he is hosed."
12636,I've been doing that the past three weeks.

12651,ECMO is really a difficult thing to come by in general.
12652,A couple years back my friend’s son was going to be born with a severe birth defect that they thought could be treated with ECMO until he was a little bigger.
12653,She lived in Connecticut.
12654,The nearest pediatric unit with an available ECMO was in Philadelphia.
12655,That’s over 200 miles away.

12706,Australia is on another level when it comes to communicating the seriousness of Delta to their citizens so people are generally more on board with restrictions.
12707,In Sydney they’ve coined the term “Fleeting contact” to describe the lightning fast transmission of the Delta where contact tracers describe CCTV video where two people passing by each other resulted in covid transmission.

12786,How does that work?
12787,Triaging is the decision making process of prioritizing care based in who is most likely to survive.
12788,Being vaccinated is a factor in favor of surviving.
12789,All things being equal except vaccination status then that's the deciding factor.
12790,Were the pregnancies even started during the pandemic though?
12791,"Pregnancy is 9 months, so a lot of babies born during the pandemic were started before the parents knew there was going to be a pandemic."

12811,We even just discussed our booster dates a few nights ago so I was at a loss when she told me.
12812,Is there any major concern I should be worried about?

12821,"If you get infected, being vaccinated helps."
12822,"&gt;The good news is that among Israel's serious infections on Thursday of this week, according to Health Ministry data, there were nine times more serious cases among unvaccinated people over age 60 (178.7 per 100,000) than among fully vaccinated people of the same age category, and a little more than double the number of serious infections among unvaccinated people in the under-60 crowd (3.2 per 100,000) than among the vaccinated in that age bracket."
12823,"&gt;The bad news, doctors say, is that half of Israel's seriously ill patients who are currently hospitalized were fully vaccinated at least five months ago."
12824,Most of them are over 60 years old and have comorbidities.
12825,"The seriously ill patients who are unvaccinated are mostly young, healthy people whose condition deteriorated quickly."
12826,"&gt;Israel's daily average number of infections has nearly doubled in the past two weeks and has increased around tenfold since mid-July, approaching the numbers during Israel's peak in the winter."
12827,Deaths increased from five in June to at least 248 so far this month.
12828,"Health officials say that currently 600 seriously ill patients are hospitalized, and they warn they cannot handle more than 1,000 serious infections at the same time."
12829,At this point if they're going to deny vaccines then they most prove natural immunity and if they don't have it they must seek it.
12830,Yes I'm saying they should be required to catch covid if they refuse a vaccine.
12831,We can perfectly fine wear masks indoors or in groups all through the year if necessary - and it is necessary.

12889,I'm scared ( and sad ) for my community.
12890,"If it makes you feel any better, there's also the possibility of a *better* variant: one which edges out Delta in transmissibility and so takes over, but which has less severe effects on our health."

12892,"If anything the opposite, since a virus that doesn't hurt us isn't anything we're going to vaccinate or otherwise mitigate against."
12893,China's vaccine is shit though.
12894,Delta is rampant in the Netherlands but there are very few deaths and hospitalisation rates are dropping.
12895,I think there’s a large portion of people that aren’t anti vaxxers they just don’t have trust in the leaders that are telling them to get it or the big pharmaceutical companies that have harmed the population multiple times in the past and gotten sued for it.
12896,And based on the amount of hypocritical shortsighted recommendations of the cdc i see where those people are coming from although i did get vaccinated

12927,Your extrapolations are based on a false premise.

12956,My sister is a NURSE in Washington and REFUSES to get the vaccine.
12957,"She doesn't care if she is infected when treating patients, because *their* health is *their* responsibility, not hers."
12958,She's been bitching non-stop on Facebook about how they want to mandate the vaccines.
12959,She is so fucking selfish.
12960,"By infection rate, and stronger infection rate specifically against vaccines."
12961,"Symptoms could also become stronger, but this would be random."
12962,"You might get something worse than current Delta, or you might get something milder."
12963,"For example, take a look at the data here:
nextstrain.org/ncov/open/global

This chart displays all the mutations by various variants and how they came to be."
12964,It can be seen that Alpha variant started to appear and mutate more as vaccines were rolled out and Delta variant took over when vaccines were freely available to everyone.
12965,"It seems extremely likely to me that virus is responding to vaccines in the sense that if there's a favorable mutation on a variant that will get through defenses this same mutation is likely to live on as it's capable of infecting people, which other mutations can't."
12966,"Extrapolating from this, I think it's plausible to think that this virus is very capable of mutating and creating new variants responding to vaccines."
12967,Technically vaccines could even make mutations happen faster and randomizing symptoms every time.
12968,"But for many people, hope and optimism is the only thing that can help them get through the pain associated with restrictions."
12969,"They need to believe that this will be temporary, for the sake of their mental health"
12970,"""Antivaxxer"" means different things to everyone."
12971,There's plenty of unvaccinated people who are getting vaccinated even now.
12972,So I think these conversations are valuable because there's a LOT of fence post sitters.
12973,Covid would only have the evolutionary pressure to become less lethal if that made it more likely to spread.
12974,"As Covid has a relatively lengthy period of infectiousness before presenting symptoms, that pressure to become less lethal is reduced."
12975,"Delta is a perfect example of this, it’s overtaken the other variants yet it’s also more lethal than they are."
12976,[removed]
12977,Mask recommendations were deceptive - but I figured they did that early on to ensure that hospitals didn’t run out of masks.
12978,"I mean, just looking at the run on toilet paper… people would have hourded masks and respiratory devices and hospitals would have been SOL."
12979,"Efficacy has not been oversold - cdc talking points = vaccines massively effective against COVID and early variants, but they were never sure about transmission rates."
12980,Their bungling of Delta is what pisses me off - the fact they decided only to track hospital-based breakthrough cases is pathetic.
12981,"most people are not thinking, they are in war mode meaning anything one side says or does the other side does the exact opposite."
12982,The issue right now is children in public schools.
12983,"I say mask them up,  spread them out, test regularly."
12984,"But one side says ""no you cannot make my child wear a mask"" and the other side says ""you will wear a mask, and your teachers will take an experiment vaccine that will not even prevent them from transmitting the virus to your kid""."
12985,Neither position makes any fucking sense unless you accept that we as a society are at war and this has absolutely nothing to do with public health anymore.
12986,Compromise is the only thing that works.
12987,"Wear a mask, distance yourself, get tested."
12988,"Forced vaccines or refusal to follow any safety measures is obviously completely irrational from what is known about this virus, but so is war."
12989,I'm curious to see this one get the go-ahead.
12990,It's a 3 dose vaccine that produced sub-convalescent NAb titres in the phase 1/2 trial.
12991,Can you sight source for education?
12992,NH has a reputation for shit public schools.
12993,surely these officials know that deliberately hiding numbers is only sewing mistrust.
12994,Looks like Chicago's getting a head start.
12995,Masks mandatory again indoors starting today until ???
12996,and various vaccine mandates are already being implemented (my work has one).
12997,Some schools (a few of my friends experienced this) waited last year until students had moved onto campus into dorms then within the next 2 days after moving in informed the students they would be doing online learning throughout the semester and wouldn’t refund the cost for room and board regardless of if you chose to stay on campus or not.
12998,It makes sense though with the huge elderly population here.
12999,"As bad as our vaccination rates are, the elderly are still on par with the rest of the nation… meaning they inflate our numbers more than other states and we are about as bad or worse than Alabama."
13000,So it makes sense they’d all be younger.
13001,I’m about ready to move to another country.
13002,"Even the countries with the highest vaccination rates in the world are experiencing delta outbreaks right now, there isn’t some covid-free place where they’re living life like it’s 2019."

13031,And how many hospitalizations/deaths?
13032,So now they want people to wear a mask outdoors at the MN State Fair.

13056,"These people don’t give a flying fuck about facts, science, reality, their own health, or cause and effect."
13057,"They care about preserving their little corner of the world, getting brownie points from their trusted leaders, and being a part of the in-group."

13105,"But once everyone has been infected or vaccinated, they will have some protection, and covid will not be a threat to our hospitals."
13106,"Protection against severe disease, coming from memory T cells, has not waned, and there is reason to believe it will be very long lived."
13107,"Antibodies do wane, so people are getting infected again."
13108,"Yeah, but I would imagine most countries will do covid passports where unvaccinated will have to test themselves while vaccinated don't in which case vaccinated might be spreading more unknowingly if delta's infection rate even after masks and vaccines is high enough."
13109,Is this for vaccinated people too.
13110,"Breakthrough cases do happen and depending on age and health, that can be an issue."
13111,Also kids can’t get vaxxed
13112,"&gt;  Vaccines have absolutely reduced hospitalizations but ""only"" by about 50% (look at the ratio of hospitalizations to cases now vs. last winter/spring, and you'll see what I mean)

Yeah that's a disingenuous bad-faith way to frame the data."
13113,I notice you don't point out that hospitalizations are overwhelmingly unvaccinated.
13114,Not to mention the R0 of delta is 2-3 times higher.

13179,And now children.
13180,One of the things that has always frustrated me a little bit is the focus on the spike protein.
13181,Of course it’s important because it is necessary for viral entry.
13182,But it also is less than 1/25 of the total viral genome.
13183,All of those other proteins in the virus that work inside the infected cell seem to be getting ignored.
13184,I don’t think that spike binding and activity alone is enough to explain this crazy difference in the virus’s phenotype.
13185,I really would like somebody to systematically look through all of the other proteins in the virus and see what amino acid changes in those might be responsible for the dramatically increased viral loads that we are seeing in infected tissue.

13238,I can not see reported case counts as a legitimate statistic.

13246,Masks went to trashcan and so on.

13248,The pandemic takes new turns all the time.
13249,"There might be some new bomb in the Christmas season waiting, and it will hit you harder if you take too nonchalant approach now."
13250,So I confess that immunology was never my strong suit.
13251,"Basically, antibodies are developed by cells called B cells."
13252,"When the B cells are developing, they undergo a series of mutations in a very specific part of their DNA that helps to randomly create candidate antibodies."
13253,"These candidate antibodies are displayed on the surface of the cell,And if they buy into an antigen that is being presented, the best sellers allowed to mature and start making actual antibodies."
13254,"If you have a bunch of circulating antibodies that you did not make, then they will simply buy into the antigen and neutralize it."
13255,This will never allow it to get it to developing B cells.
13256,This is why an Rh negative expectant mother is given an infusion of an antibody against Rh positive blood.
13257,It prevents her from developing her own antibody response against Rh positive blood so that she doesn’t kill the baby.

13259,"Based on data from the NYT, is NYC around 57% fully vaccinated?"

13326,They are necessary but not sufficient for a return to normal.

13362,"It took them so long to say that masks are effective, and COVID is airborne."

13364,or that they didn't know COVID was spread through the air.
13365,Before the virus was identified outside of Wuhan we had more than enough evidence that it was spreading through the air.
13366,"They likely said those things to ensure that was not a massive demand for masks immediately, and so that people didn't panic."
13367,"More recently, they have oversold the efficacy of vaccines, because vaccines are the most important tool for fighting COVID and they rightfully want to maximize the number of people that get vaccinated."

13391,"Vaccinated breakthrough CFR in the UK for 30-50 is 1/3,000 with Delta."
13392,By comparison the average annual mortality risk for this age group is something like 1/300.
13393,So this will increase your all-cause mortality for the year by about 10%.
13394,Remember that breakthroughs are semi-rare; in the UK data vaccines reduce them 9-fold.
13395,"With a one-month gap between doses this is much lower and should wane faster, but a booster should take it up above that factor of 9."
13396,Without vaccination that 9-fold protection against infection goes away and you're also (in UK data) about 3.5x more likely to die if you do test positive.
13397,"The training your immune system got against the vaccine still helps you in breakthroughs, but they are no joke."
13398,The idea that breakthroughs are always mild is absolutely false.
13399,And that's without even worrying about the 30-fold higher risk for the unvaccinated.

13410,"The only distinction would be if these inflammations are only one of many higher frequency severe adverse reactions from the mRNA vaccines, which I don't think is true."

13612,"First, as stated in the article, the P681R spike mutation fuses with an uninfected cell ***three times*** faster than a spike without the mutation."
13613,That is no small efficiency gain right then.
13614,But it has also picked up another trick: the enzymatic cutting of this mutated spike attachment now causes a new spill of preactivated viral RNA into the host cell in advance of the main delivery.
13615,"Essentially, the virus just needed a better skeleton key to open more doors three times as fast and wide."
13616,Hence the exponentially higher viral load seen in Delta.

13675,"If you look at studies of other coronavirus that were spread pervasively through the world, and how well, or not well, modern immune systems handle older variants, like with a study that analyzed coronavirus 229E, it seems it takes about a decade to mutate surface features enough to have true and worrying immune escape."
13676,"For now the immune escape of worrisome variants like alpha and delta have essentially boarded the train of immune escape, but the train is travelling around the city of protection and hasn't yet headed for another city called ""we're royally f'ed""."
13677,"When/if that happens thanks to having so many hosts they might hit the lotto of mutations necessary to increase transmissibility fitness and increase severities of illness, you'll more than likely get a new vaccine regiment that has two serotypes protected against in it, or more, like we do with flu."
13678,"For now you're protected quite well against these variants, and just have to stay boosted to remain well protected."

13708,They have one of the highest vaccination rates of any country.
13709,Other vaccinations are already required for public school.
13710,This isn’t new.
13711,There aren't laws about places where smoking isn't allowed near you?
13712,"Pfizer was on track for late September FDA EUA submittal prior to the FDA requesting the number of participants be doubled, which was in late July."
13713,They also are requesting 6 months of data for the age bracket instead of 3 months which was used for all other age brackets.
13714,"I hope 3 months for double the people will suffice, which would probably put them at November submittal."
13715,Otherwise we’re screwed and submittal won’t happen until February.
13716,That’s a very grim winter.
13717,September is the best case scenario but I’m doubtful.
13718,Maybe a rolling submittal could be utilized
13719,"OK, I'm probably going to get a lot of downvotes for this, and it may be a totally mean thing to say and belongs in unpopular opinion!"
13720,And I don't mean those who became pregnant before the pandemic... because they didn't know what was coming....
13721,"But for those parents who actively decided to produce a baby during this whole high-risk crappy what the heck is going to happen next the world is falling apart pandemic mess (and I am talking about those that made the choice to, not the people who became pregnant accidentally, such as BC fails)... but honestly... couldn't the lower cognitive scores be genetic?"
13722,[removed]
13723,This isn't correct.
13724,We will reach heard immunity to delta.
13725,And delta is out-competing all other variants.
13726,"For Covid to mutate to total immunity escape it would have to have 20 simultaneous mutations on the spike protein, which will not happen."
13727,"We're going to get there, but apparently we collectively as a society have decided to do it the stupid, painful way."
13728,"You'll probably catch delta too, if you haven't already, but my vaccinated friend, you have little to worry about for yourself."
13729,My whole family already caught it.
13730,It was an annoying cold.
13731,"Vaccines work, and Covid is not magic or some kind of demon."
13732,"It's mutation rate is in line with other corona viruses, which is to say, slow."
13733,"It will become endemic, but for the vaccinated, life will return to normal soon enough."
13734,"To all American doubters...: 

For the last 2 months we had almost complete freedom here in Denmark and it's completely amazing!"
13735,Our first jab percentage is 74.5 and second jab 67.8.
13736,We are only rolling out moderna and Pfizer here and we are basically back to normal.
13737,We have a buffet in the work canteen and nobody gets sick any more.
13738,"Weddings, baptisms, and other activities where people come together are pretty much constant since we've waited so long and finally everyone feels safe."
13739,Due to the very high compliance rate of our population.
13740,Please help steady the world economy and save yourselves from horrible death.
13741,"Get a vaccine and get to grow old and watch the world survive ❤️

Even my 12-year old got it and except for the scary needle all is good."
13742,She also got her HPV vaccine recently and has like 15 different ones from childhood since we lived in different countries.
13743,She is never really sick and we can safely visit her great grandmother without any problems.
13744,"The daily deaths in Denmark are between 0 and 2 in the last month, and our elders are getting a booster jab to be extra safe."
13745,"I shake people's hand and use sanitizer right after, but still..."
13746,I shake their hand!!

13750,It wasn’t a pointed question gorge I was just curious 💙
13751,Can't they send them to poor countries instead?
13752,[removed]
13753,"If they are that staunchly anti-vax, they should lose their jobs."
13754,A mask is not an acceptable substitute for vaccination.
13755,The vaccine wasn’t finished yet when I got COVID.
13756,It was impossible to be vaccinated.
13757,Think they are implying last year the vast majority where older than 40 or even older than 50 or 60.
13758,I just find it to be sort of weird and creepy (for reasons I don't fully understand).
13759,"Every time I drive to Oregon, I make sure my tank is full before I leave Washington."
13760,Would focus on other proteins give more help for further vaccines or cures attempts?
13761,Give me the second one.
13762,Maybe a bit of the first.
13763,Put I'm going to pass on option 3.
13764,I think we're in the final fight and things will be pretty solid come the holidays.
13765,Cut off your nose to spiderface
13766,22 IQ point drop.
13767,Less educated mother is said to be fair even worse.
13768,Sample is still too small and too geographical limited.
13769,"I would like to see studies from other part of the US, and from Europe, Asia, south America."
13770,"You know what we need less of, especially when it comes to government and public policy?"
13771,Transparency.
13772,Who needs it?
13773,^^^^/s
13774,Can we back up for a second?
13775,73% of adults 18 and up have had one shot at least.
13776,That goes to 91% if you're looking at ages 65+.
13777,"There is a percentage of people who are just never going to get it, but they are the vast minority."
13778,"I would rather focus on the people who can't get it for other reasons, like those who can't afford to take time off for one shot or can't afford to take sick time to deal with side-effects."
13779,There's still a subsection of the population who thinks you have to pay for the shots and that is another barrier.
13780,I don't disagree with anything you are saying- but focussing on conspiracy theorists is a waste of time in my opinion.
13781,Southern ER doc here.
13782,Almost all the bed stats are lies and are always painted into a way that makes it look much better than it really is.
13783,"We have something like 50 beds available, but no nursing to staff them, so completely unusable."
13784,What do they tell the public?
13785,"We have 50 open beds, not the -40 staffed beds."
13786,"Over 50% of our beds in the ER are filled with admitted patients, wait times are 8+ hours."
13787,"Just wait till those people realize that when more nurses get sick, as they will, less beds will be available, making the situation even more dire."
13788,"But don't you worry, no mask mandates, school back in session without masks or social distancing, rates of infection are nearly as high as the Jan peak and climbing."
13789,It's honestly a war zone in the ER every day.
13790,"And it has caused our docs, nurses, and staff all to become so jaded and hate humanity."
13791,"""In a longitudinal study of 672 children from Rhode Island that has run since 2011, those born after the pandemic began showed results on the Mullen scales of early learning that corresponded to an average IQ score of 78, a drop of 22 points from the average of previous cohorts."""
13792,How the hell did pre-pandemic babies have an average IQ of 100?
13793,"The average US adult IQ is only 98.

13814,What are the differences?
13815,"Those who claimed heliocentric models were correct were going against what was currently accepted by the scientific and religious communities, that geocentric models were correct."
13816,There were troves of observations and assertions to back up geocentrism.
13817,Heliocentrism was demonstrably false.
13818,The state fairs should just be requiring proof of vax like every other large gathering at this point.
13819,I would also be OK with them allowing unvaccinated people to get J+J at the door and letting them in.
13820,"That's a risk (the vaccine won't have kicked in yet), but worth it to get more shots in arms."
13821,I don't think anyone is seriously denying Delta is worse than the original COVID variant for kids/adults/everyone.
13822,I just can't help but be frustrated at the language that people are throwing around.
13823,"I want hard numbers, not the sort of vague ""*Many people are saying...*"" level of discourse that a former president loved to use."

This dude seems one of the unlucky ones, but looking at his wife, she got the jab just after he was diagnosed."
13827,"Oh, I wonder why."
13828,"If you haven't heard yet, Cullman is the most famous ""Sundown Town"" in AL."
13829,I'll let you draw your own conclusions...
13830,[removed]
13831,Maybe then it will just be the new dress code.
13832,"&gt; The CDC estimates over 1.1 million of the ""newly vaccinated"" are booster shots."
13833,"Which would be less than 10% of the 15M first doses that were given since we saw the ""bump"" of vaccines that started on July 6th."
13834,"So, no, /u/birdsofterrordise it's not a large percentage of the newly vaccinated."
13835,This is a distraction and deflection.
13836,"Peiple who are unvaccinated and not masking-which is most of the unvaccinated, they are loud and proud-are a at FAR higher risk of transmittung COVID."
13837,"Focuding on prople who are vaccinated, masking or not, is BS."
13838,Insurers aren't part of the health care industry.
13839,Hospitals are and they are the ones that don't get paid and will have the burden.
13840,I'm so sick of idiots.
13841,"Despite the headline, the article says this is a three-dose jab."
13842,"Considering how little the anti-vax crowd in the US understands mRNA vs DNA's role in the vaccine process to date, I'm not sure an explicitly **DNA** vaccine requiring *three* jabs with a *66.6*% efficacy rate is going to go over too well in the US market, but this is another tool in the global toolbox against potential variants so that is great."
13843,But they are impressionable... to facts.
13844,This being a bad thing is yet again a poor reflection of the conservative platform.
13845,Buy a private island and move there.
13846,Don't allow anyone near the island.
13847,The R0 increasing should speed up its spread and move toward endemicity.
13848,[removed]
13849,"I believe there are directives relating to triage though that would preclude judging based on terminal obstreperousness, keeping it based on probability of survival."
13850,"So, vaccination status would figure in to that, but not be the only factor."
13851,"Just off the top of my head, of course."
13852,With the softest of paper hands too
13853,My dad was quarantined in the house with my mom during her breakthrough infection.
13854,He continued to test negative the entire time.
13855,"And he got his vaccine in the clinical trials, so, even past the waning antibodies, his worked."
13856,"And she didn’t get very sick, so, that’s also good."
13857,"Probably the worst time to smoke is when you're about to go to sleep as that's when a lot of people experience the racing anxiety mind (did I turn off the stove, does sally in HR hate me, etc)."
13858,"When you were younger you were building up conditioning between the plant and a sense of adventure, or the good feelings you get from your buddies."
13859,"The smell, taste, etc becomes like ringing a bell for neurotransmitters that compliment the altered state and I suspect building up conditioning like that in yourself is especially easy while stoned."
13860,So basically just find ways to build up associations with pot and good times.
13861,"Smoke only before you're about to do something you really enjoy that requires your complete attention: Exercise (if you're in good cardiovascular health b/c of smoking blood pressure issues), playing sports, video games, socializing w/ other stoners, watching a movie, etc."
13862,I particularly enjoy cycling and smoking or lifting weights and smoking while listening to music.
13863,It's good to make it a bit of a ritual too.
13864,Think of the way the British and the Chinese create systems around tea time.
13865,These trifling things are just a game to take your mind away from serious matters.
13866,"If you smoke when you're already anxious and have no recent positive conditioning to counter it, you're basically just making pot your anxiety bell."
13867,In Hamilton they recently recorded the 20-29 age group as the least vaccinated group in the province.
13868,"What about doing away with all regulations, then?"
13869,"Kids drink liquor free, structures built out of empty PBR boxes - I'd ask why just covid health regulations, but we all know the reasoning at this point."
13870,Madness.
13871,"Yeah, and if you think they're being honest, I've got a bridge in Brooklyn I'd like to sell you."
13872,"if you can currently get any vaccine, which one would you"
13873,Participating in society includes much more than having a job and being in school.
13874,Frankly most people aren’t in school.
13875,"It includes going to the gym, bar, restaurant, movie theater, shopping mall, etc."
13876,Do you really think the neighborhood diner down the street is going to ask everyone for their vaccine papers?
13877,Lol.
13878,The shopping mall isn’t gonna have a guard at the front asking for your vaccine papers to get in.
13879,"Sure, but at what rate?"
13880,The virus isn't going away.
13881,"So we gotta understand the risks and just cope and make informed decisions based on probabilities, not wishes."
13882,I'm in the south too.
13883,The only delay in testing is for rapid tests because of a supply issue.
13884,Probably in an effort to keep people out of the hospital and from wasting valuable ICU/hospital resources.
13885,"At least in the US, the vaccination is free."
13886,There's a new strain of cbd called delta-8/delta-10 that still gives you a bit of the high feeling without any of the psychoactive effects.
13887,A lot of my long time stoner friends have been switching because of their anxiety and it helps a lot.
13888,You can find it at pretty much any smoke shop or even order it online depending on where you live.
13889,"Me too, also the booster would be better used to vaccinate South America, Africa and South East Asia with the first 2 shots than the wealthy zip codes of California"
13890,"It is in a strictly technical sense correct to report the deaths this way, but the reason people are claiming this as obfuscation is because when the average user checks how Florida's deaths are trending online, all they'll see is 30 deaths a few days ago and 10 deaths yesterday, which might look like they're doing just fine."
13891,I've seen several comments on here claiming exactly that in the past week.
13892,"At the very least, they should report a flat ""number of deaths added"" per day so that we have some idea of how things are going."
13893,I had to look this up.
13894,"“I believe that that is certainly what these families are looking for, to strengthen their children to go out as the apostles did, to be apostolic, taking the Truth of Jesus Christ—which we believe is the salvation of humanity—and to bring that into the culture, into businesses, into the medical field, into law practices, into the arts, into every aspect of society,” Strickland said."
13895,"So, create a community of like-minded people to raise children surrounded by friends that will only confirm their beliefs."
13896,"Then, expect them to go out into the world, immerse themselves with people from all backgrounds in order to share/spread their faith."
13897,"I don’t see what really changes, are you immune compromised/afflicted with some other condition that makes covid worse?"
13898,Otherwise it really shouldn’t be worrying you too much on a personal level.

13913,More immunity evading is likely if not inevitable as that's just how viruses evolve.
13914,More deadly is questionable.
13915,"From an evolutionary perspective, lethality isn't that useful."
13916,A host who lives and spreads the virus is more useful than one that's dead.

13947,I would be okay if offices remained closed.
13948,WFH has been nice.
13949,"Thinking about it logically, China is one of the only countries with competent long term planning capabilities due to their government structure and composition (large proportion of engineers and scientists)."
13950,We'll see the long term economic and health effects of the different strategies over the next decade and I think China will be the winner solely because we were too arrogant to learn from them.
13951,Even taking the masking advice seriously took us months and contributed to the anti-masker movement.
13952,"People can withstand and recover from short term hardship, especially with government support, but extended and repeated hardship causes lasting damage."
13953,Small businesses in particular are not resilient enough to withstand repeated lockdowns and governments can't afford to bail out businesses repeatedly.
13954,I really think that we need to just have them sign papers acknowledging that they are receiving a treatment derived from fetal stem cells.
13955,Hopefully most of them will pass on medical care after that.

13960,"Sure it does, when you consider that 66% is normal capacity, and that RSV came back with a vengeance when we reopened."
13961,It doesn’t take very many to fill the few beds any given hospital has for kids.
13962,"Yes, vaccine approval would help, and I tend to agree with the Academy of Pediatrics that they should do it now, but we’re still talking about very small numbers compared to adults."
13963,I wish I could do edibles.
13964,I'd rather save my lungs.
13965,But even a tiny edible dose (and I know what I'm doing) makes me loopy.
13966,Same-day testing at CVS in my area has been slammed for weeks unless you are willing to travel.
13967,I had to go to an Urgent Care in the morning to get an appointment for late that afternoon for a test a few weeks back.
13968,It's bad down here in the Southern US.
13969,What will the virus do next?
13970,The answer may SHOCK you!
13971,"I work at a hospital, and we expect exponential growth between now and mid October."
13972,According to today's projections the Delta situation should be better by then.
13973,"However, other variants could arise and the situation could change at any time."
13974,I don’t understand how people can think it’s a permanent thing when this virus hasn’t been around for 2 years.
13975,That’s observations for decades down the road for “permanent”
13976,Agreed.
13977,I really don’t understand how people don’t see the possibility of it mutating to something worse the longer we drag this out.
13978,Usually it’s the same people that’d proclaim (loudly) they would do anything for their kids or country.
13979,Getting a vaccine seems like a pretty low effort way to contribute to your community.
13980,"!remindme 4 months

Hi future self, how's covid doing?"
13981,"Also, High School football in Alabama kicks off tonight."
13982,yay...
13983,"Back when Israel was first releasing data on reduced vaccine efficacy, there was a contingent on this sub that vehemently denied any bad news."
13984,Anyone who voiced agreement with Israel’s findings was downvoted into oblivion.
13985,"But from the rear view window, it looks like Israel has been on the money from the beginning."
13986,"It was a very helpful reminder that everyone has the capacity to ignore truths they find inconvenient, and doing so does nothing but lose them time to prepare/respond to the reality of the situation."
13987,"Also that whatever Israel does, the US will likely follow eventually."
13988,There is a data base so it is easy to verify if they are telling the truth.
13989,"Plus, it's not the CDC that gets paid to distribute vaccines."

14003,Depends on the design of the PCR test.
14004,"Look up ""S gene dropout patterns""."
14005,"Many tests look at multiple SARS-CoV-2 genes, like spike (S), nucleocapsid, and ORF1ab."
14006,"A mutation in the spike protein gene can cause the spike PCR test to fail, but the other two will normally still give a positive result."
14007,"I assume that all the tests being used now look at multiple regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome to avoid a false negative due to mutation, but I don't know for sure."
14008,"Yet, Governor Newsom isn't ordering a statewide shelter-in-place even as things get as bad as winter 2020."

14010,His neck is on the line in the recall election coming up.
14011,"I don't want him to get recalled and replaced by a Republican governor, but I don't like that beneath all this is politics getting in the way of public health."

14013,1.
14014,Weird reporting and decent claims of doing things to make numbers seem weird anyway.
14015,2.
14016,There were reports of testing sites having issues with getting tests.
14017,"Now I'm not saying it's impossible it's an authentic drop, but I'm not convinced it is."
14018,In either case if hospitalizations continue to increase for more than a couple of weeks we'll have the answer readily enough.
14019,As people keep getting exposed over and over throughout the years your body will develop immunity to each strain it contracts.
14020,"It might not be amazing immunity against getting mildly sick, but even t-cell responses are still good in the vaccines so far, and that’s what’s important to fight severe disease."
14021,"We aren’t trying to stop mild sickness, just severe sickness, which the vaccines are still effective at that so far and don’t seem to be waning for that purpose."

14027,Isn’t this counterproductive at this point in the pandemic?
14028,Why on earth are we still telling people quick hacks to make masks that are not designed and tested to protect the wearer work a little better.
14029,"Masks actually designed to protect the wearer, built to rigorous standards, and whose protection is tested and certified have been readily available for months."
14030,"Please oh please start recommending N95, KN95, or KF94 instead of encouraging people to keep trying to improve “leaky masks”."
14031,Personally I would strongly suggest N95 because in my experience they actually seal properly while I’ve never gotten a complete seal with the KN95s I’ve tried.
14032,"One good thing from this is that is being boycotted by people who don't like masks or vaccines (proof of vaccination or negative covid test required for Grandstand concerts), which is exactly the population I'd rather stay away from the fair."

14042,Your prejudice against the US is what allowed families and lives to be pointlessly torn apart.
14043,"You shouldn't be looking at US plates thinking there's delta, you should be looking at every license plate thinking that could be delta and I'd better keep myself and others safe by wearing a mask, getting vaccinated, and not dining in god-damned restaurants."

14052,They've always been in the top five in terms of educational achievement in the United States.
14053,Despite having some of the lowest spending per student.
14054,They have the second highest population average IQ in the nation.

14064,"If I’m going to challenge my body with another immune response, I want to see clear evidence of the benefits."
14065,I also want to know if it’s better to receive one of the vector vaccines instead of another mRNA.

14067,Not concerned with mild Covid.
14068,"But then there wouldn't be any left...oh wait...wait I get it, yeah."
14069,"Here in VA, the department of health and UVA put out a report last week that said a spike due to delta in September is unavoidable."
14070,The only question is how big of a spike we experience.
14071,"The best-case scenario is getting to 85% vax rate for eligible adults, plus masking and testing (not going to happen)."
14072,"Still going to be a spike, no matter what."
14073,Just masking and continuing the current vaccine uptake rate can lower projected cases by about 25%.
14074,"We're around 55% fully vaxxed, I think."
14075,"Meanwhile, almost everyone is in \*la, la, la, nothing to see here\* land."
14076,Schools are starting and most will have mandates.
14077,So that's something.
14078,Eating and having masks off during P.E.
14079,will diminish the value of masking though.
14080,And mask-wearing out and about in my local area is probably &lt;20%.

14084,That makes sense though if you have a large body of vaccinated friends.
14085,"If you have 100 contacts and they're all vaccinated... then yeah, at least 4 of them are going to get it even in the best case."
14086,Probability is fun.

14103,Nobody has any long-term effects that we don't completely know the ramifications of.

14112,They have done this for head lice at least the past 30 years.
14113,What took them so long to do this?
14114,With beds full of covid patients it means if you get in a car accident you don't get a place in ICU so you die instead.
14115,It should be federal policy to stop medicare/medicaid for unvaccinated people at this point.
14116,Good god.
14117,Just get vaccinated.
14118,How fucking hard is it to just get vaccinated.
14119,The absolute absurdity of it all.
14120,People just want to suffer like it’s the 13th century Black Plague.
14121,We are going to have far more deaths per capita than uk or Israel because we have legitimately vulnerable populations refusing the vaccine as a political statement.
14122,I agree though that there is no way it ends up as bad as the winter wave in the US.
14123,It is those other ‘characters’ that shine but I like the way Clarkson has been canny enough to let them and let himself be the fall guy.
14124,And I’ll admit I might have been a little moved when he said how happy he was on the farm.
14125,I feel like I even know a lot more about the difficulties for ‘real’ farmers.
14126,This is a statistical effect that happens because there are much more vaccinated people than unvaccinated.
14127,"To imagine it better, consider everyone being vaccinated."
14128,"Then, 100% of hospitalized cases are vaccinated no matter how well the vaccine works."
14129,This is sort of a weaker version of that effect.

14137,"Mayor could authorize the Health Department to send City employees (not just police) who are not masked (all, not just based on vaccination) home without pay."
14138,A nice complicated bureaucratic process to apply to return to work would be nice.
14139,Let's start on the top floor of 1 Police Plaza and work our way from there.
14140,Darwinism at its finest.
14141,"&gt; I want to get my vaccine soon, and the advice is to wait 28 days after testing positive to get your vaccine, why is that?"
14142,The primary reason seems to be to avoid spreading it to others.
14143,"For example, the US CDC guidance says in part:

&gt; People in the community or in outpatient settings who have had a known COVID-19 exposure should not seek vaccination until their quarantine period has ended to avoid potentially exposing healthcare personnel and others during the vaccination visit."
14144,This recommendation also applies to people with a known COVID-19 exposure before receipt of the second mRNA vaccine dose.

14178,Last year's plan was grandparents and those around 40-60.

14180,We had a shutdown for specific reasons (high cases and overrun hospitals) and those factors are being reported at higher levels now.
14181,I still don’t get why we aren’t using a tool that worked.
14182,Just 2 weeks would see a drop in cases and reduce hospitalizations.
14183,The “stupid actions” of some people doesn’t justify “stupid inaction”.
14184,Which will make it even more difficult for the NHS in the winter perhaps when COVID is an addition to flu and the winter vomiting virus.
14185,Maybe we need to stop looking at spare capacity as *waste* and think of it as flexibility so we don’t have a crisis every winter?

14194,What's the baseline for how many are usually in use before Covid?
14195,How many kids have actually been turned away because of this so far?
14196,Without any of this info there's no way to tell at all whether this is a completely minor problem or a massive horrific problem.
14197,"Would have gone with “Well, we all knew Georgia was a Delta hub”"
14198,Fair enough.
14199,But there's still too many eligible people not vaccinated.
14200,It's the 1 bottleneck keeping this a pandemic.
14201,"If we actually had 80% vaccinated, hospitals wouldn't be swamped."
14202,Covid would no longer be the threat to our healthcare system it is.
14203,I can always tell who doesn't travel much or isn't vaccinated by how easy they think it is to fool the vaccination checks.
14204,I truly do not follow the logic at play here.
14205,Reducing viral load and time that a person is infected literally work to stop transmission.
14206,Its not 100% but the efficacy is super fucking high.
14207,How do you think we stop transmission?
14208,Vaccinated people are not a petri dish?
14209,"Lmao are you getting this ""data"" from Joe Rogan?"
14210,Vaccine resistant strains develop within in unvaccinated people because there is so much more viral load coming from the unvaccinated that a mutation is bound to happen.
14211,Not the other way around.

14226,Vaccine uptake is relatively high here compared to some other places.
14227,I assume being able to go on a night out again is a factor since even during summer the weather does not always make outdoor eating and drinking possible (something I'm sure you've noticed if you're here right now :-)).

14269,"First of all, according to the [AAP](https://www.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/children-and-covid-19-state-level-data-report/), deaths from COVID in children could account for up to 0.25% of all deaths from COVID, or about 1500 out of about 624000 in the US."

14290,"Rabies takes anywhere from a day to a year  to infect its way up your nerves to your CNS (only then becoming symptomatic and 100% fatal),  so this combo approach is very successful in stopping the disease."

14331,There highest peak was in January where it was around 60k a day.
14332,"Deaths in January was as high as 1,200/day."
14333,Now its around 90/day.
14334,"Compared to the US, our peak cases was in January around 250k/day, now were at 140k a day which looks like its near the top."

14450,"If you run through this whole process in a vaccinated person, the same applies, but the strains that make it through and become more dominant, are now also a lot better equipped to handle a vaccinated immune system, leading to more resistant strains."

14501,He had been hospitalized since late July and admitted to the ICU on Aug. 3.
14502,"He had been on a ventilator at Spartanburg Regional Hospital, suffering from pneumonia, renal failure and blood clots."
14503,"Stutts was a member of the Tea Party and helped found MySCGOP, a conservative organization intended as an alternative to the S.C. Republican Party."
14504,"He was a leader in pushing for a more right-leaning Republican Party that led to the resignation of Greenville GOP Chair Jennifer Black, 1st Vice Chair Stacy Shea and state Executive Committeeman Randy Page."
14505,He was a fervent supporter of President Donald J. Trump and posted photos on Facebook of himself with the former president.
14506,"After Stutts tested positive for COVID and was hospitalized, he continued to post Facebook messages reaffirming his belief that masks and vaccines should not be mandated by the government."

14520,Who cares if our leading medical experts know what they’re talking about?
14521,Hmm
14522,This is better than getting the shot?
14523,Really?
14524,"How am I supposed to feel about this picture when overwhelming evidence and a clear, easy path exists to not be in this situation."
14525,I have seriously mixed feelings here.
14526,Anger is one of them though.
14527,His major donor also had a huge stake in the company making this treatment.
14528,"Can someone explain whether we will only be allo
wed to get the booster after 8 months after our 2nd dose?"
14529,So if you got your 2nd dose in April you need to wait until December?
14530,Israel is doing everyone 40+ now.
14531,That started July 30.
14532,They are using the 5+ month time table.
14533,Idk about this.
14534,I can’t find anyone else reporting on this.

14541,We absolutely will regardless.
14542,Israel showed us that.
14543,Sure this was asked in an interview so an answer was expected but they should have just said we don't have data right now to say anything.
14544,Even if you don’t mention names of who has it?
14545,Wow
14546,"No, it's both and people know it

Take Mexico for example."
14547,Pfizer is our second supplier in doses.
14548,"We don't have storage capabilities, and yet, Pfizer is given in the country fine (although reserved to urban areas at the moment)

The government here makes it clear all the time: the problem is supply

And it's not only ""middle income"" countries like Mexico that have the issue."
14549,"Look at places like Japan, NZ, Australia."
14550,"They have the money, the logistics."
14551,There are no shots to be given

14553,You know all of those parents are going to happily sit in the stands unmasked and breathing on each other.
14554,I feel this.
14555,I am vaccinated and believe in the science and encourage others to do the same.
14556,But it really sucks how much everyone gave up on caring to do their part to manage the pandemic once they got vaxxed.
14557,"I get it, I was elated to receive a vaccine and ""get right back to normal"" too... and I went back out to restaurants, met with friends, and even ditched the mask for awhile."
14558,But we cant keep denying the reality that is in front of us.
14559,"Its fantastic that vaccines really help keep us safe, but the fact is, that the pandemic isnt gone, it has the potential to get even worse, and our personal actions continue to contribute to the situation getting better, or worse."
14560,"Theres no real reason anyone NEEDS to host/attend a big event, or pack themselves in to busy restaurants, or jump on a cruise ship."
14561,"I know we are all collectively exhausted, traumatized, overwhelmed."
14562,I'm not saying everyone needs to lock themselves at home with a hazmat suit on.
14563,I'm just really disheartened that so many folks are willing to give up the fight because they no longer think covid has the power to personally affect them.
14564,Which of course is false.
14565,"But, here we are."
14566,I realize this isnt the most popular opinion.
14567,"But I'm just getting really confused by why it's seemingly becoming less common to understand that, even if I dont get sick, me needlessly bouncing around the world could kill someone else."
14568,Hmph.
14569,Don’t pretend that Democrats don’t also do it.
14570,Elimination is the only realistic path.
14571,Both China and New Zealand have shown it is possible.
14572,Other countries need to get on board and eradicate COVID-19 just like we eradicated smallpox virus and have almost eradicated polio virus.
14573,It's not easy.
14574,It takes a lot of commitment and international cooperation.
14575,But it is worth it.
14576,I am 99% sure the upvotes on posts like that is people smacking the upvote without thinking because they see a high number so it must be a good post.
14577,"So most cases it's luck depending on if the first people who see your post decide to up or down vote

But who knows people's votes might change with the wind like you said"

14589,There’s already a bill in the works to ban schools from mandating masks.
14590,All these deniers can take a long walk off a short pier.
14591,I asked my 1st grader if wearing the mask at school all day created an issue and the response was “I don’t notice it during the day”.
14592,"If kids understand why they’re wearing a mask, why can’t the powers that be get their heads out of their arse and do some good for a change?"

14597,"Double that, it's about 9.5% have had a confirmed case."
14598,"Most people who have had the virus and survived also got vaccinated, and then there's breakthrough cases where vaccinated people got it anyways, not to mention however many people got it but never got tested, the % of people who actually had covid is probably much higher than 9.5%."
14599,[removed]
14600,exactly.
14601,the line has to be drawn at some point.

14606,"I just don’t buy it with school starting,  more and more vaccinated people getting sick every day, stagnating vaccination rates, new variants…this wave may peak but that doesn’t mean it won’t just shoot up again in the Fall and Winter just like the cold and flu do"
14607,Right?!?
14608,Why should somebody needing urgent care for a sudden unexpected event like a heart attack or a car accident not get the care they deserve because of someone who willfully refused the vaccination?
14609,And that could have prevented their hospitalization in the first place.
14610,I’m losing faith in part of humanity at this point
14611,It explains why Delta cases skyrocketed and then plunged unexpectedly.
14612,A huge number of people had Delta but never knew it.
14613,"What I want to know is, if I don't get a booster, does that almost certainly mean someone else gets that dose, or is it likely to go to waste?"
14614,I'm sure the truth will vary from place to place
14615,Let’s stop treating drunk drivers and giving away organ donations to help them live too!
14616,"I hate to say it, but we need to see more photos such as this."
14617,It drives the seriousness of the situation home more than a talking head on the television.

14649,"I used to feel sorry for these people, not so much any more."
14650,Hopefully only other idiots who didn't get vaccinated.
14651,Yeah I think this is an issue with the media.
14652,"Journalist asks ""will we need to get booster shots every year?"""
14653,"She replies ""It's not certain."
14654,In the case of Hepatitis B two primer shots followed by a booster is all you need.
14655,"It's possible COVID could be like that but we don't know."""
14656,"Perfectly reasonable response but then the article headline almost makes it sound like she believes we won't need continual boosters, which is not what she said."
14657,But the Govenor said it is up to individuals to determine their own safety as long as you don't wear masks
14658,"In other words, we will need a 4th shot by the spring."
14659,Look at India's second wave.
14660,"It was insanely sharp and we got back to stable covid levels, although with masks on, but it's still decent considering density and vaccine coverage."
14661,The delta peaks get fast and goes down very fast.
14662,Maybe the CDC should make as few statements with “mights” and “maybes” as possible if they want people to look to them as the experts?

14666,"&gt;Last month, President Biden announced that federal employees would have to attest to their vaccine status or else face regular tests and requirements to wear masks, among other restrictions."
14667,Employees also face discipline that could include firing if they falsely say they’re fully vaccinated on a new form that is now being distributed among the 2.1 million civilian federal workers.
14668,"Stephanie Rapp-Tully, a partner with the Tully Rinckey law firm, said that it’s well established that a federal employee making a false statement on an official form can be disciplined, potentially including firing for a first offense."

14676,"&gt; “God gave you an immune system that is 99.9% able to beat this thing,” she said."
14677,"“Your vaccine is only 90 percent."""
14678,This is the problem with people not knowing WTF they are talking about.
14679,They hear 2 percentages and somehow think they mean the same thing.
14680,"In this case, she is claiming that the CFR for Covid is .1%."
14681,I believe conservative estimates were .8%.
14682,I won’t even get into how merely living after Covid is not the whole story.
14683,She tries to compare this to a 90% vaccine efficacy.
14684,A number that has nothing to do with death rate in this context.
14685,A number that simply means your chances of catching Covid after vaccination are reduced by 90%.
14686,"So if you had a 100% chance of getting Covid, the vaccine takes that down to a 10% chance."
14687,I’ve resolved that foolish people will be fooled by simple lies.
14688,"There is no hope for them, and I hope their ignorance doesn’t get them killed."

14692,Sunday was sick in the morning and took work off for Monday.
14693,On Monday I was just tired but didn’t feel terrible.
14694,I needed up taking Tuesday off just to get extra rest.
14695,"I went to work Yesterday and was feeling totally fine, but at around 3pm I got a sore throat."
14696,"Now I took off work again today, I have a painful sore throat, body aches again and a mild fever again"
14697,&gt;It's a virus.
14698,There won't be a cure.
14699,Genuine question - are viral infections just particularly difficult to develop treatments for (in a way that bacterial infections aren't)?

14708,"While on family medicine, I counseled obese patients that refuse to diet or exercise."
14709,I would damn near beg patients to just walk 30 minutes a day and start 1 meal at a time and hardly make any effect.
14710,"While on nephrology, I cared for a patient x3 in the same 2 months for uremic encephalopathy because the patient repeatedly refused dialysis."
14711,This year I've dealt with a number of patients that died of covid despite refusing the vaccine.
14712,The answer to all these things as medical professionals is to continue to fight for our patients tooth and nail.
14713,Continue to counsel them and treat them despite them going against our advice at every turn.
14714,I get that people love to rip on anti-vax folks on reddit and I promise you I'm 100% pro-vax and have convinced many many patients to get the Covid vaccine (even got to stick em with it).
14715,"But we can't lose our humanity or endorse health care professionals to give up on patients that, even if ignorantly or arrogantly, gave up themselves."

14808,"Unless it's like u/Mkwdr says, and I'm looking at it from the wrong perspective, and what we maybe will finally end up with is a society who has SO many antibodies and memory t-cells from SO many different vaccines tailored to SO many different versions of the spike protein, that THAT is what is going to force this pathogen to be SEEN AS a head cold by our bodies."

14893,I still think the rest of the US may be dealing with surges after the South is done.
14894,And they'll blame it all on schools when it's really just COVID being COVID.
14895,And you actually believe the average American knows that?
14896,Not everyone who needs an ICU bed has covid.
14897,Other medical conditions still exist.
14898,There are immunosuppressed people who were vaccinated but didn't have a very strong response to the vaccine.

14924,[You can read the article here.
14925,"](https://archive.ph/ocMX6)

First paragraphs:

&gt;North Texas doctors have quietly developed a plan that seeks to prepare for the possibility that due to the COVID-19 surge the region will run out of intensive-care beds."
14926,"&gt;If that happens, for the first time, doctors officially will be allowed to take vaccination status of sick patients into account along with other triage factors to see who gets a bed."
14927,"&gt; A copy of an internal memo written by Dr. Robert Fine, co-chair of the North Texas Mass Critical Care Guideline Task Force, was sent to members of the task force -- and leaked to The Watchdog."
14928,"It summarizes the latest work by the task force, a volunteer group that periodically updates medical guidelines for hospitals in our region."
14929,There are about 50 members from various hospitals in the group.
14930,"Although their recommendations are not enforceable, the guidelines are generally followed."
14931,"&gt;The one-page summary memo is a “heads up” alert in the event things get worse, says Dr. Mark Casanova, director of clinical ethics for Baylor University Medical Center and a spokesperson for the task force."
14932,"After Monday’s meeting, doctors had yet to make plans to inform the public."
14933,"&gt;“We’re trying to decide how to explain this addition to the public,” Casanova said."
14934,A 70% vaccination rate puts them ahead of the curve.
14935,At least in Australia's case there is some controversy over how things went down last summer.
14936,The official line is that Pfizer only offered them 10M doses and both the AUS government and Pfizer are repeating that same story.
14937,Multiple independent sources have come forward though saying that the AUS government sent a Jr. representative who tried to haggle over the price and gain access to intellectual property.
14938,That dramatically slowed negotiations while other governments like Israel were willing to simply buy as much as they could immediately at the asking price.
14939,That's the unofficial explanation for why several other countries were able to secure large contracts in July while Australia didn't secure a much smaller contract until months later.
14940,"There's an article about it in the Sydney Morning Herald:

https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/deal-or-no-deal-what-really-happened-in-last-july-s-pfizer-meeting-20210622-p5838e.html"
14941,"I guess this means the cruise industry hasn’t been giving him enough money, because he’s been trying to put them out of business.￼"
14942,They also posted about it on a public Internet forum.
14943,Doesn’t seem like they have an issue talking about it 🙄
14944,"According to the advice in the memo, no, doctors should take into account why the patient is unvaccinated."
14945,Thank you!
14946,I’m definitely feeling lucky to be where I’m at now!
14947,But I felt so sorry for the kids with covid in the ER it must have been so scary for them.
14948,Tbh if any one who is anti vax or is still considering covid as a cold if you walk into any dfw Er right now it’s awful.
14949,People were coughing so hard and unable to catch their breath in between they were just vomiting on the floor it was terrible
14950,They will overflow their patients to your area.
14951,"As a teacher, I get so frustrated when anything education related gets put in the mainstream spotlight because so many people show how little they actually know/care."
14952,A point I agree with you on is people acting like these kids have just been sitting in isolation all summer.
14953,"At least in my district, the majority of these kids have maintained their social lives throughout the summer - hell, they maintained them last year too."
14954,"We did everything to keep them apart during the school day, but it didn’t matter when they hung out outside of school anyway."
14955,"But what really, really bothers me is people acting like schools being a hotbed for disease spread is some new thing."
14956,"Every single elementary classroom in every single school, every single year, is a disease factory."
14957,"Illnesses come in waves, and you can tell when a handful of students from a single classroom are all out sick at the same time."
14958,Or in general when schoolwide attendance is light and the most common thing you’ll hear from teachers is “there must be something going around”.
14959,Is this is a good thing?
14960,"No, students shouldn’t be sent to school when they’re sick to spread those illnesses to begin with."
14961,"However, it’s reality and one that every educator knows very well."
14962,Did anyone care about this at all before covid?
14963,"Hell no, it was just how it is."
14964,Kids get sick from other kids at school.
14965,"Even more frustrating is once covid becomes endemic and we are back to normal, these same people will go back to not giving a shit when other viruses and illnesses are passed around classrooms."
14966,"No one cares that RSV numbers are high right now, it’s all about covid."
14967,"Essentially I’m tired of people using school as a way to boost their ego and signal how good they are when it comes to covid, without having ever given a single thought or care to the numerous illnesses that have spread in classrooms before or will happen afterward."
14968,"This has been said before, but it’s all just posturing for people to say “look how good at the pandemic I am and how much I take covid seriously!”

All this to say, where I differ from your opinion is that it’s inevitable students will get sick this year."
14969,"It doesn’t matter what mandates are put in place, with both covid and rsv spreading like wildfire, students WILL get sick."
14970,"Hopefully all of them stay mild, but anyone acting like the spread of disease in school is completely preventable, ESPECIALLY in elementary, is delusional."
14971,"I have had this thought as well, however it should be mentioned there are a lot of people on Medicaid currently not eligible for any Covid vaccine."
14972,Y’all are salivating i bet
14973,What is wrong with his eye?
14974,Dude should sort out his lazy ass eye before begging narcs for info.
14975,Why are people still resisting easy protective measures?
14976,"""Less than a month into the new school year, more than 20,000 students, or nearly 5 percent of children, in Mississippi’s public schools have been sent home to quarantine."""
14977,"I thought the vaccine was to prevent people
From getting sick enough to need the ICU."
14978,I would think vaccinated people needing to go to ICU would be minimal.
14979,They should get proof from their doctor.

15116,"Hear, hear."
15117,I am a more moderate Democrat that wasn't opposed to voting for a principled Republican over a batshit Democrat.
15118,Those Republicans don't exist anymore.
15119,They made that choice for me.
15120,Wayne County is at 67.36%.
15121,"Yes there's a lot of room for improvement, but the rural counties in Michigan are doing much much worse."
15122,"Whatever source you read that misled you into believing Michigan is being held back by the ""democratic stronghold of Detroit"" was lying to you."
15123,They probably just looked at total # of unvaccinated people instead of % of unvaccinated people so they could push their agenda.
15124,"Of course cities will have higher #s just because their population is higher, but the vaccination percentages in rural areas are much worse than cities."
15125,"[https://www.michigan.gov/coronavirus/0,9753,7-406-98178\_103214-547150--,00.html](https://www.michigan.gov/coronavirus/0,9753,7-406-98178_103214-547150--,00.html)"
15126,"""Originally, a person infected with the ancestral strain of the coronavirus spread it to 2.5 other people on average."
15127,But the Delta variant is estimated to spread to five to eight other people.
15128,"That means that within 10 cycles of transmission of the virus, in a population with no immunity to the virus, instead of fewer than 10,000 people being infected, more than 60 million will be infected, Dr. Carlos del Rio, an Emory University epidemiologist and infectious-diseases expert, said at the same UC San Francisco forum."""
15129,Yaaaay.......
15130,"I was thinking about this, and.... not necessarily."
15131,"Look at the UK where more than 90% of people are estimated to have antibodies, and yet their cases are holding steady at a pretty high rate."
15132,"To me, that makes me think that many more people have some level of protection than the case counts are showing, so there are still a lot of people testing positive, but the hospitalizations and deaths will continue to decrease as we transition into the endemic ""cold"" that COVID-19 will eventually become."
15133,There's also the different groups getting sick this time.
15134,"Younger, healthier, people that don't have the same rate of hospitalizations and deaths, which could play into it, as well."
15135,"I'm not sure which case it is, or maybe a little bit of both, but yes, it's interesting to me that hospitalizations and deaths are peaking before cases!"
15136,Wouldn't you want that for yourself and loved ones?
15137,?
15138,"It sucks getting old (I’m 39) but a positive of being this age is that I’ve gotten to see the internet go from dial-up and compuserve to what it is today, which is actually kind of hard to describe."
15139,"A mobile phone is an absolutely amazing device, it can do so much and it has so much power and so many sensors."
15140,"When I was a teen I lived far out in the country and couldn’t call my friends because it was long distance, isn’t that crazy?"
15141,"Probably my favorite thing is that You can get a huge 4k tv for just a few hundred compared to the expensive shit they used to have, and decent home theaters are cheap too."
15142,Lost mine years ago.
15143,This post appears to be about vaccines.

15146,*
15147,Oh trust me I know.
15148,"I think that is technically what the CDC said, but both VA and CA are taking a much more liberal view of it."
15149,"The email I got from my city said something like “if you are immunocompromised, have been recommended by your doctor, or have another medical condition putting you more at risk” (I’d tell you the exact wording but I have deleted the email since I’m none of those categories)."
15150,My friend also does not meet the clinical definition of immunocompromised but her doctor recommended she go get one since her condition is rare and it’s unknown what effects Covid could have on her.
15151,"As far as I know, no one is checking medical history."
15152,I’m sure it depends on your jurisdiction but I think the reality right now is that supply exceeds demand and pharmacies are happy to use up doses.
15153,True.
15154,And this pic is incredibly disturbing.
15155,[removed]
15156,They may be counting on the it is fully FDA approved by that time.
15157,My guess if you filed a lawsuit you could win it as long as not fully FDA approved.
15158,The moment is it fully approved you would not win.
15159,Because you are responsible for the health and safety of the people of your state.
15160,"And if you won’t do that, at least don’t do things that prevent localities from protecting themselves."
15161,[removed]
15162,A negative test is a negative test.
15163,She’s good.
15164,I think the CDC recommendation would be for you to go get tested if you’ve had known exposure to someone with confirmed or suspected COVID-19.
15165,"Since GF tested negative, I do not believe you fall under that rule."
15166,"By all means, look up the CDC Guidelines and double check in case I’m getting something wrong."
15167,If you wanted to be abundantly cautious you could go get a rapid test and if it’s negative you’re in the clear.
15168,No waiting 2-3 days for results.
15169,Rapids fine for a “possible” exposure.
15170,Just my opinion but you did ask for opinions.
15171,[removed]
15172,I can tell you with 100% certainty Hawaii doesn’t want her there
15173,[removed]
15174,[deleted]
15175,Moving the goal posts into a river of molten lava is a bold plan
15176,[removed]
15177,I’m getting real tired of news outlets using sensational headlines with caveats “could be” “possibly” “may be”.
15178,"Readers are taking the caveats as absolutes because they’re not reading the article, which really makes it not as serious as the headline leads you to believe."
15179,Prime example: the J&amp;J side effects.
15180,Vaccines tanked after that.
15181,The selfishness of antivaxxers is truly amazing.
15182,They're getting their education right now.
15183,"For what it's worth, I just got the Moderna booster here in TX."
15184,"I was able to walk into the pharmacy, no appointment."
15185,They did ask to see my previous vax cards but it was to ensure that it was past 28 days since my last dose.
15186,"You do need to fill out paperwork, but it's very basic and pretty much mirrors all the same questions that the original doses asked."
15187,They gave me my flu shot alongside it.
15188,Just passed my first 12 hours and I pretty much feel the same as I did for my other doses.
15189,"Sore arm and a bit queasy, so far, is the worst of it so I'm really hoping it's not a rough go as the next few days pass."
15190,Hope this helps shed light on the booster process as of yesterday here in TX.
15191,"Things may change, of course, but I thought it might be helpful to share my first-hand experience."
15192,"As a Texan, I would like to verify that we're not all complete morons."
15193,"It's just that the complete morons are abundant, ignorant and inbreeding."
15194,Unfortunately the discussion of politics and our COVID-19 response and policies are now inextricably mutual.
15195,"There is no logical or functional manner in which to separate the two, as our culture and leaders have chosen to marry the concepts."
15196,"If we’re to continue meaningful dialogue, political influences are going to have to be discussed."
15197,(Preparing for my observation to be removed 😊)
15198,Seems sensible for every country to require that though.
15199,Surely Iceland requires a negative test for him to enter?
15200,[deleted]
15201,"Off of the top of my head: 1) Why the ""long-term risks"" are not as unknown or significant as they seem and 2) why these vaccines are not ""an experiment on the population."""
15202,Holy cow do I run into both of these arguments a lot!
15203,"&gt; obvious in hindsight

15205,I feel bad for young doctors.
15206,"Old doctors... well, what was that thing where you voted (R) all those years?"
15207,Didn't see this coming?

15209,[removed]
15210,There are a lot less pediatric ICU beds than you are thinking lol.
15211,It holds that the far left and right ends of the traditional political spectrum bend back towards each other.
15212,"Basically, both ends tend toward similar types of authoritarianism."
15213,&gt; Companies may find themselves losing their top talent if they try to pull that stunt.
15214,"They absolutely will, it's amazing how much power we have when we put our foot down."
15215,"Yeah, I remember my first exposure to anything resembling internet: dial in BBS and Juno email."
15216,"I was in elementary school, then."
15217,"I think we had a 2400 baud modem at the time, making my current connection... something like 125,000 times faster."
15218,"Even this wireless connection on my phone absolutely blows it out of the water--a phone that is so much more powerful, and has so much more storage space, than the hulking full tower PCs of my childhood."
15219,"Quite a transformation, indeed."
15220,One thing I *am* surprised about is how un tech savvy today's kids are.
15221,"I always thought I was the first of a new breed, but that hasn't proved to be the case."
15222,"Kids today are better than my parents, sure enough, but most are still pretty tech dumb."
15223,"In retrospect, I think it is because computers and the internet had an air of mystery about them when I was younger, encouraging fascination, exploration, tinkering, and creation."
15224,"Today, it's just ubiquitous, and there are ready made apps for everything."
15225,Oh well.
15226,"Job security for me, I suppose!"
15227,I stand by that statement.
15228,"I didn't say, ""And now we know the EXACT NUMBER of people..."""
15229,Not a lockdown but a look down
15230,"Ha, I had the very same idea just yesterday."
15231,[removed]
15232,I saw the donut advertising And was pretty intrigued.
15233,I recently started work for a small private company.
15234,"I would use donut If it was available to us, but I'm not sure if my company would spring for it"
15235,"While in general that might be a reasonable way to think about it, I don't think it quite holds up to the numbers in this particular case."
15236,The relative prevalence of Lambda peaked in April according to the Nextstrain website.
15237,"But if we look at the [global daily case counts on Worldometers](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) we see that the total number of covid-19 cases also had a peak in late April, coinciding with the peak of Alpha in continental Europe and the start of the Delta wave in India."
15238,So Lambda had its highest relative prevalence when global case counts were at or near an all time high.
15239,"While global cases (of all variants combined) are again on the rise, the absolute number of Lamda cases will be considerably less now than it was back in April."
15240,"Yes but instead of blaming the undeserved people, the government needs to step up and help."
15241,Cities like Los Angeles regularly publish racial/ covid statistics so that the public health response can use that to guide it
15242,&gt;Maybe we are because cases aren't growing as fast as they were a month ago?
15243,I am quite certain that both India and the UK are already reaping the benefits of herd immunity.
15244,"They have a far lower case load than before, despite less restrictions."
15245,please explain
15246,[removed]
15247,It isn't a mandate if you can opt-out.
15248,Bad management.
15249,Bad public health.
15250,No mask?
15251,Go home.
15252,"I'm already anxious about it, beat ya to it nerds"
15253,How long after recovery does it take to test negative?
15254,I can’t go back to work until I don’t test positive anymore.
15255,I tried demanding an explanation from the only anti vax individual I care about at this point.
15256,He just laughed at me.
15257,It’s infuriating.
15258,That's a side effect
15259,"I worked next to a large oncology group, the number of people you'd see wheeled out after their chemo and or radiation and the first thing they'd do when they were 10' away was light up a cig was kind of mind blowing."
15260,All that proves my previous point of more evenly spreading the economy.
15261,"Having such vast differences of incomes &amp; cost of living, is unsustainable and is just begging for more financial crises like 2008 if anything goes wrong, like another virus pandemic."
15262,"If those people choose to live in the city, that's their choice, but the vast majority of employees (under 50 years old) want remote work forever."
15263,"&gt;And you don't think that companies, which have the sole focus of maximizing profit, don't have better ways of measuring this than we do?"
15264,They have looked at the data and are bringing people back.
15265,"You haven't even considered what's inherently wrong with this statement, and it's quite sad."
15266,It's about maximizing profit at the expense of everything else.
15267,"Forget employee opinions, commutes, expenses, well-being, mental health, or literally anything other than money - if the data supports it, just shove the cattle back into their cubicles."
15268,"This is, of course, assuming there is any data."
15269,"More than likely, it's some bullshit about 'corporate culture' - which is comical."
15270,Hospitalizations and deaths matter more than cases.
15271,"Unfortunately, hospitals are currently overrun in the undervaccinated portions of the country."
15272,Terrible take.
15273,Smoking is an addiction.
15274,Most people want to stop but can’t.
15275,[removed]
15276,That is scary.
15277,She’s not worried at all.
15278,I have some things that make me at risk but I’m not around her all of the time so I just hope she doesn’t pass it on to me.
15279,She’d be fine I’m sure but her unvaccinated boyfriend?
15280,My parents in their 60s?
15281,It worries me for sure.
15282,What’s the evidence that the chances of Delta mutating to become more vaccine resistant are very low?
15283,That’s some nice sounding news

15285,"Possible, but less likely."

15296,&gt;This is so frustrating and preventable for the most part.
15297,Severe outcomes from COVID have become pretty preventable thanks to vaccines.
15298,"At this point in the US, I'm not sure how preventable infections are."
15299,"Short of a months long nationwide lockdown and everyone wearing KN95 masks or better, COVID is going to spread."
15300,"After over a year of warning and with proven measures to reduce the threat, amazing this is where certain locations find themselves."

15422,What I do know is that the statistics demonstrate that we are not serving this population well.
15423,"I don’t have access to any private data or anything, but from what articles I’ve looked over it looks like a mild covid19 case will have someone producing antibodies for 5-7 months, and a strong infection or the vaccine for at least 8 months."

15438,"That’s true, and I certainly hope for that to happen."
15439,"However, since it’s also totally plausible for an even worse variant to emerge, it’s hard to not be concerned about variants…

An argument I’ve often heard is that unlike most other viruses which usually mutate to become less deadly when becoming more transmissible, SARS-CoV-2 can potentially mutate to become more transmissible AND more deadly, because it has a long incubation period and does not kill its host immediately."

15447,"&gt;If you follow a zero covid policy like China, you can reduce local transmission to zero for most of the year and catch breakthroughs early enough such that only a minimal number of people are affected."
15448,"At this scale, a few affected areas, the government is completely capable of supporting those affected."
15449,"To contain the current outbreak China had to lock down multiple cities and employ resources to test tens of millions of people at once, with a ripple effect on many other sectors like shipping, exports and tourism."
15450,"And that's while being completely shut off the rest of the world and having extremely strict border policies, which is already impacting the country's economy."
15451,And you're telling me this is more sustainable and will have less of a severe impact on the economy and society than non better specified large scale long term cognitive impacts of covid?

15479,With 95% of all patients rushing to the emergency room with Covid 19 symptoms being unvaccinated... We need to adopt a “Vaccination before treatment” policy at hospitals.
15480,Not in the US.
15481,Immunization records are recorded but with state governments.
15482,"Unfortunately, because we have some states that are lead by mor0ns, they've strongly resisted any nationalized proof of vaccination, and ignorantly called it unpatriotic."
15483,"So states that are not run by such leaders, have state level solutions that are getting rolled out, but are slowing easing into using them, cause plenty of Americans are paranoid pricks, who will otherwise throw a collective tantrum; even if mean disrupting the lives of everyone else."
15484,"That said, a bunch of states are starting to adopt SMART health cards that, when integrated with their individual systems will function as a nationwide verification system, and should be accepted globally."
15485,I remember when I got downvoted and told I was a nut job for saying this is not going away even if 75% vaccinate.
15486,"Ever since Iceland, I've been parroting this and yet on many posts I was downvoted and some were deleted as misinformation."
15487,Yes this!
15488,"Interesting article from global news (Canada)

“Around half of the country’s 600 patients presently hospitalized with severe illness have received two doses of the Pfizer Inc shot, a rare occurrence out of 5.4 million fully vaccinated people."
15489,"The majority of these patients received two vaccine doses at least five months ago, are over the age of 60 and also have chronic illnesses known to exacerbate a coronavirus infection."
15490,"They range from diabetes to heart disease and lung ailments, as well as cancers and inflammatory diseases that are treated with immune-system suppressing drugs, according to Reuters interviews with 11 doctors, health specialists and officials.”

Given Israel’s latest booster campaigns, I’m curious to see how this translates to hospitalizations down the road."

15501,It's total horse shit.
15502,"The lady pushing this idea is the ""vaccines magnetize you"" lady."
15503,"But, at this point, mom doesn't care to check her sources."

15672,"The question is how much of that will be permanent, probably not a lot."
15673,"The big problem is of course that lower income and education in the parents is already associated with slower development, so those kids may not catch up..."
15674,Stop.
15675,Posting.
15676,Percentages.
15677,It’s literally useless and flat out shitty journalism.
15678,Give us the case numbers and hospitalizations.
15679,"Ok I said ""like here"", which is Canada to be clear."
15680,The price the US is paying now is almost a thousand deaths per day (7 day avg and rising) and &gt;140k infected per day (7 day avg).
15681,"That is not something the Chinese are willing to accept (at a larger scale, because they have like four times the population)."
15682,"Since last summer I'm pretty sure as a percentage of the overall population, the Chinese have had fewer restrictions than Americans."
15683,You linked an article from last week when the outbreak was still active.
15684,Ask them again this week now that it's under control and restrictions are being lifted.
15685,For the remainder of the year China's tourism industry was at decent levels.
15686,"For example, for the May Day break, they topped their pre-pandemic numbers in terms of trips (230 million)."
15687,"Yes they lose a bit from the international tourists, but it's still surviving off of domestic travel made possible by the strict containment."
15688,"Even Xinjiang (with 25 million people) received 158 million tourists in 2020, and they are expecting 200 million this year."
15689,"I went to orientation a couple of days ago at my kids’ school and judging from the amount of patriot bug-chaser parents who were refusing to wear their masks correctly, I think it’s unlikely that this is going to get better during the first few months of school."
15690,My understanding is that Oregon has been really on the spot with vaccination roll-outs and mack and other mandates.
15691,"In fact they had, up until Delta, one of the lowest case rates in the country."
15692,What had happened?
15693,Is this just solely due to Delta or is something else going on?
15694,"I don't think my Dad would want to do anything ""unofficial""."
15695,"I realise we're throwing out doses and all, but that just isn't something he would want to do."
15696,"He'll only get it when he can go in somewhere, be honest about his vaccination status, and still get a third shot."
15697,"If he can't do that, he'll be waiting until he gets it in November."
15698,The other aspects are well known as it shares commonalities with SARS and MERS
15699,Lambda and B.1.621 are already arising.
15700,I think the chances of things being better by Christmas are very slim.
15701,It feels like we’re on the precipice of things going very poorly very quickly.
15702,"If you are a plague rat, you have the obligation to stay home."
15703,Us vaccinated people have done our part.
15704,"You want to be selfish and anti-social, you don’t get to be in society anymore!"
15705,[removed]
15706,The proposed 8 month interval is likely based on when mass vaccination started in the US (about 8 months) - driven by logistics so there isn't a sudden rush for boosters.
15707,Once you get past the minimum intervals the exact timing is unlikely to be critical.
15708,"For instance, the shingles vaccine is approved for any interval between 2 and 6 months between dose 1 and dose 2); it's been tested at one year (it's only slightly less effective)."
15709,"If you miss six months, guidance is to just get the 2nd shot ASAP."
15710,Largest motorcycle rally in America.
15711,About 1/2 a million people show up and most are anti-vax.
15712,I do not think this is preventable at this point.
15713,I am double vaccinated and still got it.
15714,The metric really should be hospitalizations.
15715,This is the thing we can still control.
15716,We can no longer control infections.
15717,Oh geez.
15718,"Make sure to report them, please."
15719,"The youngest were 3 month old in June 2021, the oldest had the last trimester during the pandemic."
15720,So it's about 50/50 for this study
15721,you make it sound so easy...
15722,Because we live in a terrible world where Russia and China or any other foreign adversary will use any method to harm us.
15723,That's really not good at all.
15724,"Especially considering majority of people who ""feel fine* are less likely to get tested."
15725,Delta is one hellish variant
15726,This seems like screaming at a wall at this point.
15727,Anti-vaxxers gonna anti-vax.
15728,I'm in the same boat.
15729,"I believe the science, I got the vaccine."
15730,But it's gone on long enough.
15731,I don't think I'm willing to make those sacrifices for the people who were too selfish to put a piece of cloth on or vaccinate.
15732,"I'm going out mask less and hopefully I don't get anybody immunocompromised sick, but if I get an anti masker sick, so be it"
15733,"Even a piece of cloth helps, at least in terms of slowing spread."
15734,"It may not offer full protection to wearer but still, having entire STATES full of people acting like the pandemic is over is NOT helping."
15735,I had a breakthrough case a month ago.
15736,I was wrecked for 5 days and I'm still not 100% back to normal.
15737,I think they just mean that very few people *anywhere* were wearing masks.
15738,"If nobody anywhere is wearing a mask, there's an arguably higher risk (or least a higher discomfort) than if everyone is wearing masks *in general*, but only taking them off at a restaurant."
15739,Y'all need to plan for covid instead of being surprised by it.
15740,"I have covid (mild) - double vaccinated, took all the precautions i could reasonably take."
15741,I had to do a work conference and my idiot coworker went ao 1000+ gathering then i had a work dinner with him.
15742,"I did everything i could reasonably do, and covid still broke through."
15743,The only thing I could have done better is simply not go but my career and my company was really needing the trip.
15744,So after 18 months of quarantine I made the trip and got mild covid.
15745,"IT sucks because I likely have now transmitted it to a few people, but everyone in my circle is vaccinated."
15746,"My kids might or might not get it, but hopefuly they will be fine just like every other illness."
15747,"I guess the point is - this will break through, its inevitable."
15748,"You actually WANT to get mild covid, get a immune boost."
15749,I am not concerned about long covid much because the symptoms are so mild.
15750,It could be an issue but probably long covid is related to how severe the disease is.

15752,"You big chasers never run out of bullshit justifications for your snake handling, do you?"
15753,"No, you should be telling people to get vaccinated instead."

I don't agree with your confidence in that, but please back that confidence up by at least voting"
15755,I get bad anxiety with indica and even some sativa hybrid but never pure sativa (when I can find it).
15756,Everyone is different which concerns me regarding one size fits all mandates.
15757,Is it?
15758,I've heard that it's more contagious in general but nothing about outside specifically.

15761,Everyone is going to be eligible starting in Sept.
15762,The traditional vaccines developed in India &amp; China use a dead virus.
15763,"I guess they would be effective against all variants as the body might develop antibodies against not just the spike protein, but other parts of the virus."
15764,"The Covaxin from India is less effective against symptomatic infections than mRNA vaccines, but they are 100% effective against severe effects AFAIK."
15765,"Wildfire smoke notably increases your risk of contracting the virus, and the air quality in NorCal has been pretty bad for several weeks."
15766,"Add to that the amount of people who are displaced, and it's really making a tough situation, a lot more grim."
15767,"Thx, my Dad will definitely ask his Doctor about it at least."
15768,That's fantastic.
15769,Last I heard it was mid winter so this is great news.
15770,[removed]
15771,"Ha, good luck."
15772,Already ahead of you on the anxiety.
15773,Nice try Delta.
15774,That's probably because so many people in the UK are vaccinated.
15775,"&gt; So far, more than 47 million people have had a first vaccine dose - 87% of over-16s - and nearly 41 million - 75% of over-16s - have had both doses."

15778,Thx
15779,So will we just have to keep getting vaccinated against new variants (as long as they keep working) and the unvaccinated will just keep creating new variants until the world ends?
15780,"Seriously I do understand the caution, but it is very frustrating."
15781,I saw a doctor in California that said quite a few cases are from folks coming in for other reasons and having their mandatory Covid test come back positive.
15782,My guess is Delta is going to push us to basic herd immunity in some areas.
15783,Overwhelming majority of those hospitalized with Covid and dying with Covid at this point are unvaccinated.
15784,Those are the facts.
15785,"Tiny is relative of course, and variants have been having effects on that."
15786,I also recall seeing fairly good data in the early days that suggested the original Wuhan outbreak was likely started by a much more virulent variant of the virus with a significantly higher death/complication rate.
15787,"It behaved more like original SARS, spreading slowly, but killing more."
15788,"This probably fooled Chinese authorities into thinking it was something like SARS, or SARS itself."
15789,But at some point fairly early on a new variant split off that was much more contagious (sort of like Delta is signficantly more contagious than previous variants).
15790,This was the variant which broke out worldwide.
15791,"If that turns out to be true, then it starts fitting a troubling pattern."
15792,"The virus seems to be rapidly mutating (not surprising), and the mutations that are successful in taking the mantle of the pandemic are the more contagious ones (also not surprising)."
15793,"Theoretically, in order for the virus to become more contagious, it may be sacrificing some of its disease causing abilities, which should lead to lower mortality rates (which we may be seeing with Delta already)."
15794,"That points to the scenario many have hinted at, which is Covid becoming a seasonal disease that circulates along similar lines as influenza."
15795,I'm looking into distance options.
15796,The term has begun and they required decisions in May.
15797,It may not be an option at this point.
15798,"Right, their mask recommendation and their Delta tracking is, I believe, absolutely an ""ends justify the means"" kind of deal."
15799,"It's the kind of thing I want to see from politicians, but not from a group that's representing science."
15800,"By tracking breakthrough infections less, it looks like the vaccines are more effective at preventing infection."
15801,The conversation about vaccine=no mask required is what I was referring to with them overselling vaccine efficacy though.
15802,"We knew from various sources at that point that countries with better vaccination rates than ours were facing COVID surges, and breakthrough infections were happening at rates that aren't negligible."
15803,This is a teachable moment.
15804,The virus is teaching us and some of you won’t survive the lesson.
15805,"I would think many lawyers would fight for the school, free if charge and take gov Satan down."
15806,"Generally, other health conditions."
15807,"Agreed,  idk wtf redditors think half the time, like come back to the real world, it’s not a video game where all you do it lock every one in, it doesn’t work that way, it will cause issues, financially and physically."

15813,"My point was, this is profit driven."
15814,And done while COVID is rampaging through at a greater rate than ever.
15815,"They are not afraid of universal healthcare as much as they were, so the softening of these policies is expected."

15822,"On the one hand though, fish meds don't have flavoring agents or coloring or any of that, the ingredient list is usually already human safe."
15823,"And on the other hand, they are mostly really common and low toxicity chemicals like amoxicillin."
15824,"So what we mostly encountered was people who had been prescribed an antibiotic, and were tryings to save money by buying it in a form with no quality controls."
15825,"Which is a bad idea, to be sure, but a far cry from these nuts self-prescribing dangerous experimental stuff."
15826,Cheap acne meds vs cheap off-brand chemo.

15835,Most of the 2.2 million visitors in 2019 were small town folks?
15836,You sure?
15837,"&gt;	according to Health Ministry data, there were nine times more serious cases among unvaccinated people over age 60 (178.7 per 100,000) than among fully vaccinated people of the same age category, and a little more than double the number of serious infections among unvaccinated people in the under-60 crowd (3.2 per 100,000) than among the vaccinated in that age bracket."
15838,"&gt;	The bad news, doctors say, is that half of Israel's seriously ill patients who are currently hospitalized were fully vaccinated at least five months ago."
15839,Most of them are over 60 years old and have comorbidities.
15840,"The seriously ill patients who are unvaccinated are mostly young, healthy people whose condition deteriorated quickly."
15841,Didnt they just have some massive event?
15842,When are we gonna get official word on boosters for J&amp;J?
15843,"I feel awful about my decision to take the ""2nd tier"" vaccine with how little data they're providing for it."
15844,If I had known it would be like this I would have waited for Pfizer instead of getting what was available immediately.
15845,"Ethically, I always feel we need to do what we can for everyone, no matter how much of an idiot they've been, but when resources are scarce, that's when things get tricky, and it's when we see priorities coming into play, like treating a sick child over a sick elderly person."
15846,"At a minimum, I don't see why unvaccinated people should get good facilities."
15847,Me or a family member is in an accident or something and needing a bed?
15848,"I don't want us lying on the floor in the hall because someone who had ample access to a free vaccine is taking up the good equipment, especially when our odds might be good with treatment and theirs won't."
15849,"And I don't even *like* saying that, I don't...but this is the dark place society goes to in a crisis."
15850,It happened during the Plague and various other events.
15851,"It's starts turning into ""every man for himself."""
15852,"Variant could first come from anywhere at any time, but speed of mutation and spread can come later and depend on several different factors as it's also fighting with other variants."
15853,If you look at the time when all the mutations for Delta started to occur they coincide very well with general availability of vaccines.
15854,"They also coincide very well with the fact that Pfizers efficacy has gone so low (39% according to Israel), implying that Delta variant has optimized mutations against the Pfizer vaccine."
15855,"Look at the dots on the chart, each of those is a new discovered mutation."
15856,Delta before all those mutations could've been just a milder version of itself.
15857,"For example Delta variant could've been discovered in 1921 on the moon, but it wouldn't matter until it actually started to mutate and spread fast."
15858,"Yes - but on the other hand, its incredible how science understands so many detailed molecular mechanisms, and is starting to target these specific processes."
15859,"Might take a while, though."
15860,"But, in the end, all we can do is the obvious: reduce the risk of contagion via reasonable distancing and masks and vaccines."
15861,Vaccines will get better over time.
15862,Peak?
15863,It's not even fall yet here in NY.
15864,It would be really nice if these facts and figures meant something to people who hesitate to get the vaccine.
15865,"Instead it bolsters their argument of ""see what's the point you still can get the virus!"""
15866,Yeah we have the same issue up here in WA State.
15867,There’s a ton of buildings and indoor things at the fair though.
15868,"Plus it’s literally a shoulder to shoulder crowd on some arenas even outside on the weekends (midway, busy food streets)"
15869,SF has been masked up since April of last year.
15870,Which likely also contributed to the low infection rates right now.
15871,"likely a combo of unconfirmed cases, hospital overflow, people hesitant to seek medical care for non-covid illnesses, and deaths related to the pandemic's economic effects"
15872,Rural anywhere may as well be Alabama.
15873,Source: live in a rural adjacent part of California.
15874,Both are important consent is always important because we don't want people to be forced to take it or not take it.
15875,"We will argue why we might not want it, but we are still in favor of people deciding to choose to take it without force or coercion

This disease is not preventable because the vaccine nor the masks prevent it from happening."
15876,"Countries with high vaccination rate also has large amount people in hospital, but they also have different capacity and may be from a different culture with different believes and societal standards

There is science behind those who choose to strengthen their immune system as well as stay healthy rather then taking vaccines or drugs, so it's not true they don't acknowledge basic science, they focus on other types rather than only vaccine and drug based solutions"
15877,"all while hating the big city liberals who are ""ruining America""

15881,"I *never* thought about this before, and I think you're right."

15890,/s
15891,Not sure why your being downvoted.
15892,Some cases of long Covid could absolutely be permanently.
15893,Some of the effects could be due to nerve damage or organ damage.
15894,Because it's also more resistant to existing antibodies and spreads more easily.
15895,How is that a contradiction?
15896,"I didn't say it would get less fatal, or wouldn't get more fatal; I said it would get more fatal if there's something else to gain."
15897,We can clearly see two big gains that are likely related to its fatality rate.
15898,"Assuming the same rate of exposure between vaxxed and unvaxxed (that's a huge if that, admittedly, even I am not fully comfortable making), this graph is nicely showing that breakthroughs have the potential to be far less ""rare"" than some people keep claiming if/when Delta takes off in the community and many/most/all people will be meaningfully exposed this fall (?)."
15899,"Remember, the CDC estimated that 1 in 3 Americans have already had covid by this point, IIRC."

Vaccination is the best protective measure you can take right now."
15911,Followed closely by masking in public.
15912,And if you’re high risk avoid unnecessary crowds and be careful with indoor HVAC ventilation that might circulate the virus.
15913,A guy I went to college with just bragged on Facebook that his kid’s school isn’t masking and that was an instant unfriend for me
15914,"But in most places it still does, due to low vaccination rates."
15915,\&gt; and preventable for the most part.
15916,I don't know about preventable... Delta is just too contagious.
15917,One way or another almost everyone is going to get it in the near future.
15918,The only thing we can do is try and slow it down enough that our hospitals and larger economy doesn't grind to a halt.
15919,Schools might end up being our achilles heel.
15920,No matter how hard we try everywhere else if kids are not vaccinated and spreading it in school that is putting it into homes almost everywhere and most people are not going to mask at home.
15921,Masks and social distancing are our best shot at slowing it down but nothign can prevent everyone from getting infected.
15922,"(imo)

In California the schools are requiring masks but more importantly there is a set of protocols that kick in when someone tests positive."
15923,Many other students get quarantined after that and have to stay home for 10 days even if they get a negative test.
15924,"The kids showing symptoms but get a test and it's negative, they can return sooner but because covid can develop slowly and you won't test positive for several days they're choose a route that assumes contact with the known infected, passed the virus and you won't test negative or show symptoms for almost 7 days."
15925,"This, hopefully will  make it less likely a kid will come back and keep spreading it even after a negative test and no symptoms."
15926,I'm only learning all this because I just had to go pick my kid up and keep her home for 10 days.
15927,No symptoms but contact with a known positive.

16163,I have the opposite doubt as you.
16164,"I wonder how many suicides since this started were a result of the virus itself, not isolation."
16165,"Like I told others - I reported my psychological symptoms to the CDC, and after that I checked their coronavirus page again and they added psychological symptoms."

16253,I'm starting to come around to this point of view but I just can't get over the line.
16254,High chance of not dying beats high chance of dying every time.
16255,The unknowns of either are about the same for me.
16256,Let's face it.
16257,We're gonna live with this virus for the rest of our lives.
16258,This thing might just be the next common cold or flu.
16259,However just worse in all aspects.
16260,Unfortunately that does make sense.

16264,"Realistically I know the surge would have happened regardless, but I feel like I missed my chance to give my grandmother a hug a few months ago because I was being careful."
16265,How would the CDC even be able to estimate that if they aren't asking and if there isn't one centralized database?
16266,Excess fatality meaning if 1 million people die in an average  year and this year 1.5 million people then 500 k are excess mortality.
16267,So Russia has documented 175K deaths for Covid but they also have 500k extra deaths that occurred over the year (outside of the norm) that they have no idea what caused it-maybe died at home or on the street or at the hospital but no testing was done.
16268,Often in a pandemic it's noted the true death toll is what is noted plus the excess mortality is often later attributed to the pandemic.
16269,It makes sense right?
16270,Like if we always have about a million deaths and then a pandemic hits and we get a bunch of extra deaths then something (like the pandemic) probably caused it.
16271,"Which is great, but it's still 5-6 weeks for that be useful which will be too late."

16316,Real boomer ass mentality for a communications company.
16317,It's pretty much a 100% guarantee that the virus is mutating in every single vaccinated (and unvaccinated) person who gets infected because RNA replication (and pretty much all nucleic acid replication) is not error proof.
16318,"SARS-CoV-2 has a genome that is around 30 kilobases and RNA-dependent-RNA polymerases have an error rate that is about 1.5 x 10e-3 bp-1, so you have around 45 mistakes for every genomic RNA replication."
16319,"This also happens in unvaccinated people, or anywhere the virus is replicating."
16320,The most important way to lower the chances of a variant of concern is to limit the number of parameter space that the SARS-CoV-2 genome gets to sample.
16321,"The best way to do that is to prevent it from replicating, and the best way to do that is through vaccination."
16322,"I guess there are some semantics around the word ""mutate"" because an insignificant SNP that doesn't have any effect on the virus isn't what most people mean when they say ""mutant""."
16323,So their god isn’t protecting them from this fake virus?
16324,Just the sniffles?
16325,Well stay home and call your church and ask them to start the prayer chain.

16365,I'm so tired of all of this for them.
16366,They will only never get vaccinated because we allow them to not get vaccinated.
16367,"We should either make life so bureaucratically difficult for the unvaccinated that it effectively prohibits those who choose to not take the vaccine from having a job (and also cut them off from all benefits), or just use physical force to vaccinate those who are unwilling to get it themselves."
16368,No mention if the patient was vaccinated or not.
16369,I'm betting not.

16456,It’s just not worth the risk for the little one.
16457,"&gt;Also, people are tired and want it to be over and they don't want information that conflicts with the pandemic being over."
16458,The pandemic being over has little to do with the risks of long COVID since the pandemic ending does not mean that COVID will go away.
16459,What can lower the risk of long COVID is being in a highly vaccinated populace and the US is currently not highly vaccinated so that needs to change.
16460,COVID can still cause permanent lung damage you won't see from other easily communicable diseases though.

16476,It's very likely that it does.
16477,A stronger immunity (more antibodies) would very likely lead to lower viral loads in the event of an infection.

16559,"The first few paragraphs are basically the gist:

&gt;For weeks in June and July, workers at a Maine factory making one of America’s most popular rapid tests for Covid-19 were given a task that shocked them: take apart millions of the products they had worked so hard to create and stuff them into garbage bags."
16560,"&gt;Soon afterward, Andy Wilkinson, a site manager for Abbott Laboratories, the manufacturer, stood before rows of employees to announce layoffs."
16561,"The company canceled contracts with suppliers and shuttered the only other plant making the test, in Illinois, dismissing a work force of 2,000."
16562,"“The numbers are going down,” he told the workers of the demand for testing, saying it wasn’t their fault."
16563,"“This is all about money.”

&gt;As virus cases in the U.S. plummeted this spring, so did Abbott’s Covid-testing sales."
16564,"But now, amid a new surge in infections, steps the company took to eliminate stock and wind down manufacturing are proving untimely — hobbling efforts to expand screening as the highly contagious Delta strain rages across the country."
16565,"&gt;Demand for the 15-minute antigen test, BinaxNOW, is soaring again as people return to schools and offices."
16566,Yet Abbott has reportedly told thousands of newly interested companies that it cannot equip their testing programs in the near future.
16567,"CVS, Rite Aid and Walgreens locations have been selling out of the at-home version, and Amazon shows shipping delays of up to three weeks."
16568,Abbott is scrambling to hire back hundreds of workers.
16569,"Well, yeah."
16570,"Most infections overall are asymptomatic, pushed even higher by vaccines."
16571,"So people aren't getting tested, which would cause a drastic undercount even if the CDC were adequately tracking breakthrough cases"
16572,Is anything ever confirmed in Russia?
16573,[removed]
16574,[removed]
16575,"Because unfortunately unlike them, we’re not the kind of monsters who would let someone drown in their own lung fluid, no matter how obnoxious they are."
16576,"Also, a fair chunk of our anti-vax community in the southern areas are immigrant or migrant enclaves that have issues getting info/resources and trusting the government for a variety of valid reasons."
16577,See also: Our measles outbreak from a couple years ago.
16578,"Yes, it is absolutely frustrating and dangerous though."
16579,"I was never a frequent smoker and it gave me crushing anxiety about 50% of the time...

Parties were like a dice roll... Evens: ""Duúuuuude!!"
16580,"Put that track on again!"""
16581,"Odds: ""Where did smackson go??"
16582,"He was here a minute ago"" (smackson, a mile away already, on foot: ""Omygodomygod, just walk... was it poison?"
16583,Did they spike it with acid?
16584,"Can't go home... they'll know I'm there..."" etc..)

The one time I had a great long vacay and smoked daily for a month, it was so awesome!"
16585,The buzz was pleasant every time!
16586,"So we where masks to what, double how long it takes for us all to catch it?"
16587,"Imagine being a parent in your region who's taken this shit seriously, worn a mask, got a vaccine, and still follows precautions to this day... Then your kid gets in an accident and needs an ICU bed to survive... Only it's taken by some mouth-breather who spent over a year denying this pandemic even exists only it to finally bite not only him in his ass, but doom your own child because of the seemingly criminal level of selfishness, ignorance, and arrogance of a loud group of mouthbreathers."
16588,Wow that is concerning.
16589,"My anxiety continues to ramp up, but thank you for the answer"
16590,You're right.
16591,Masks are considered a choking hazard for children under 2.
16592,They don't give a damn about families separated.
16593,It's really sad.
16594,Also kids can’t get vaxxed is why I pulled my a daughter out of school.
16595,I’d hate to think other parents can be motivated by a large hospital bill (I did it because wtf would I risk her life for six months of kindergarten).
16596,"No, because Omicron Variant"
16597,"Ah, yes, if only one in every fifty five cases die then there's nothing at all to worry about!"
16598,"Am I correct in that, starting September 20, only people who are 8 months out from their second dose can get the booster?"
16599,Seems a bit absurd given that the US is tossing millions of doses at this point.
16600,This basically puts most of the vaccinated population at getting their boosters in Dec/Jan and beyond.
16601,What's your bet on whether more people will be able to get their boosters before the 8 months?
16602,This whole situation is just stupid really.
16603,I hope you feel better soon!
16604,[removed]
16605,It's mostly permanent *damage* that I'm worried about if I get infected.
16606,I remember reading that even mild/asymptomatic cases can leave behind scar tissue.
16607,&gt;Dyer said there could be impacts to the water quality if the city doesn't reduce the amount of water we need to treat.
16608,Water in Florida is already the most foul tasting and smelly I have found in the US.
16609,"Can't imagine how bad it will be if the existing ""quality"" is reduced further."
16610,Texas and Florida really are racing each other to the bottom.
16611,Great to hear that she is an ICU nurse.
16612,"kuddos...

Staff shortages is nothing new and getting over time etc in health care even before covid."
16613,So that point is moot.
16614,"Yes, COVID merely shifted one problem to another."
16615,Hosp admin in general are a holes...just look at all the CEO pays for all the non-profit hosp etc and higher ups...
16616,Have you heard anything about 2 and up?
16617,So wish our daughter could be vaccinated.
16618,I want this now.

16636,It's bad because Delta still kills people and is much more transmissable.
16637,"A virus that spreads far and wide and isn't detectable unless you get bad symptoms, which might kill you."
16638,"If you got mild symptoms you'd be more likely to not spread it, get tested, and alert others."
16639,[removed]
16640,Unfortunately unless you end up in the ICU they're going to consider yours a mild case regardless of long term problems.
16641,My 93 year old vaccinated grandma died.
16642,Everything really just got her all at once.
16643,Might have been marked as Covid as she tested positive but she also had another stroke and her organs were shutting down.
16644,I think SF's slow down is a little of this and a little of that.
16645,"&amp;#x200B;

Being highly vaccinated is AWESOME, esp with something like 98% of the 12-17s vaccinated!"
16646,"But also people seemed to have changed their behaviors:

It was party central for the month of July, no masks, and lots of late nights."
16647,"The news about the delta surge started and you noticed people wearing masks ALOT more, social circles pulled a bit a part and the bars got slightly less crowded."
16648,"People who were going for inside dinner stopped, etc...

Not everyone of course, but enough to take the foot off the gas pedal."
16649,"I'm worried about the school re-openings, esp for the elementary schools with unvaccinated kids, and the impact of the fires if they have to close the windows due to smoke outside."
16650,"engineers dress pretty terrible anyways, ratty jeans and a loose shirt is the norm"
16651,"""Sending unmasked, unvaccinated kids into a poorly ventilated classroom is like holding the world's largest chickenpox party, except instead of chickenpox it is the third-leading cause of death last year,” he said"
16652,No.
16653,No child under 2.
16654,"Definitely not with newborns, they have enough issues breathing as it is, so it is not a good idea to try it."
16655,My son is 1.5 and we'll probably start practicing with him in the next few months.
16656,He doesn't understand yet.
16657,Send the unvaccinated people to the back of the line with minimum treatment if any they get what they get for trying to infect the rest of us and not caring even about their own families.
16658,Take care of people who actually matter and are actively trying to stop the virus like vaccinated people.
16659,I’ve read somewhere a mother’s stress during pregnancy can lower child’s IQ.
16660,Could this be what’s happening here?
16661,Yeah….no.
16662,Fully vaxxed and I have been basically back to normal life.
16663,I’m done with this shit.
16664,"Even in my state, the behavior is night and day from last year."
16665,No one is going back to any restrictions of any sort.
16666,"Mask mandates maybe, but capacity restrictions of any sort is not going to happen."
16667,Let the Southern states who have low vaccination rates feel it the hard way.
16668,If high vaxxed areas on not seeing high increases in hospitalizations then it’s time to move on.
16669,[removed]
16670,This is getting so dumb.
16671,And old.
16672,People get sick.
16673,People die.
16674,That’s life.
16675,We gotta move on.
16676,We will never conquer this.
16677,We gotta not make life miserable for those who are still here
16678,I do this too!
16679,I've  been blending about 1:2 / 1:3 ratio of indica /cbd.
16680,"This has helped immensely, after realising that after over a decade of not smoking weed, straight weed is just far too strong for me now."
16681,But blending it like this has  been wonderful.
16682,And better than increasing alcohol intake or going back on anti anxiety medication.
16683,I wish I would have discovered this blend years ago.
16684,"No, but I live in NYC and take the subway daily, go into the office, live life normally,  etc."
16685,"As I mentioned in my other comment, nobody who I’ve been in close proximity with has contracted it from me and they are all vax."
16686,Young women have testosterone and bravado too.
16687,Just not as much.
16688,/r/Collapse
16689,Right?
16690,How does this end well for desantis?
16691,?
16692,I truly wish it were as simple as this.
16693,Maybe it will be once FDA approval comes through.
16694,But honestly I just wish kids 5-12 were approved just as soon.
16695,No reason they should be included in the ostracized part of society.
16696,That is actually from the Talmud.
16697,My job needs to see this shit because they’re totally acting like this pandemic is over and they’re a local govt.
16698,Wtf kids?
16699,"That's dark, bro"
16700,We have to treat everyone that's not living in the same home with us as an infectious individual.
16701,And that is not very compatible with human nature and economy so it has limited effect.
16702,"4 days ago Florida's total deaths (on worldometers) was 40,584."
16703,"Yesterday they ended at 41,937."
16704,"That's 1,353 deaths reported in 3 days."
16705,If it's a dream location do it!!
16706,"even if you can't out to places, you can still do a lot of out door activity's I woul take it tbh"
16707,Isn't this the case with COVID-19 in general?
16708,"I tested positive last August (had to before a business trip) with zero symptoms and my State's health dept, said, ""With your age demographic, we are seeing 40% asymptomatic so this isn't too surprising""."
16709,I'm in late 30's.
16710,Delta just spreads more... significantly more but still.....
16711,I had Pfizer.
16712,I got vax almost 9 months ago.
16713,"Even though I got it, I will still get the booster."
16714,I’d get it ASAP.
16715,"I was with somebody in bed all day on Sunday (1 day before symptoms appeared) who just got his second dose three weeks ago, and he didn’t get it."
16716,The person I was in my office with all day Monday also didn’t contract it from me.
16717,"Neither of my roommates got it from me, either."
16718,We were sharing food all night Monday.
16719,The live carrier vaccines like J&amp;J and AZ also need to get into the nucleus.
16720,&gt; “Fleeting contact” to describe the lightning fast transmission of the Delta variant where contact tracers pinpoint CCTV video in which two people passing by each other resulted in covid transmission.
16721,indoors?
16722,Whats the end game here?
16723,The kids of the anti mask parents will still lose funding for thier school.
16724,Youre hurting your own children.
16725,Some Texas school districts made it part of their dress code.
16726,"I don't know how involved you are in your child's school, but it seems like a great idea to at least pitch."
16727,No kids should be unmasked if they're doing in-person school right now.
16728,"Florida, take note!"
16729,Gotta look at what terps are doing the driving
16730,"1587 deaths of fully vaccinated people out of 187,000,000 fully vaccinated in the US sounds like the correct numerator and denominator to me."
16731,"With anti-vax people, no more carrots, sticks."
16732,Make it so they can't function in society without the vaccine.
16733,"No school, no work, no acceptance into businesses and restaurants."
16734,I'm the opposite.
16735,Can take a 10 gummy and feel nothing.
16736,"Use .01 grams smoking, I'm nice and relaxed."
16737,I am a teacher in a southern state in a small school.
16738,Out of a staff of 14 I know of 5 people who are vaccinated.
16739,The rest of the staff gives some bullshit reason about their freedoms.
16740,I work with idiots.
16741,What about jnj
16742,It started on August 12th.
16743,Today ends the first full week of school.
16744,Consumerism affects all genders.
16745,There’s even states that have higher vaccine rates than Israel.
16746,[deleted]
16747,u/enterprisevalue posts incredibly informative stats each morning for Ontario covid cases/vaccinations etc.
16748,"Below are some stats I stole from them regarding vaccine effectiveness in the province:

\- Today, the per 100k case rates for un/partially/fully vaxxed people were 9.93 / 4.92 / 1.12  
\- Translated into effectiveness rates, fully/partially vaxxed people are 88.8% / 50.5% less likely to get infected than unvaxxed people  
\- Translated into effectiveness rates, un/partially vaxxed people are 8.9x / 4.4x more likely to get infected than fully vaxxed people  
\- Over the last week, the per 100k case rates for un/partially/fully vaxxed people were 7.93 / 4.92 / 1.12  
\- Translated into effectiveness rates, fully/partially vaxxed people are 86.3% / 56.5% less likely to get infected than unvaxxed people  
\- Today, the per million current ICU rates for un/partially/fully vaxxed people were 15.62 / 5.38 / 0.54  
\- Translated into effectiveness rates, fully/partially vaxxed people are 96.5% / 65.5% less likely to be in the ICU than unvaxxed people  
\- Translated into effectiveness rates, un/partially vaxxed people are 28.8x / 9.9x more likely to be in the ICU than fully vaxxed people  
\- Note that this ICU data is not complete because not all ICU patients have vaccination status recorded."
16749,Today's ICU total in this database is: 79 ( 67 / 7 / 5 ) un/part/full vax split
16750,"To add on, considering some of the potential wicked side effects, I wouldn't want to have to deal with those and a massive hangover at the same time."
16751,So just take it easy.
16752,It’s exhausting keeping the bad thoughts out of your head.
16753,I just don’t know.
16754,Keep up the Goode work this can’t last forever.
16755,No.
16756,I also don’t risk contracting cancer from smokers when I care for them.
16757,Nor do they spread their cancer around the grocery store or waiting room.
16758,"At the end of the day, they are the only one who physically suffers from their choice- outside of grieving family of course."
16759,I'm sure they are going to require masks too.
16760,"I'm afraid the ""vax AND mask"" will lead to just more vaccine hesitancy."
16761,"So, are teachers being required to vax AND mask?"
16762,"If so, until when?"
16763,Forever?
16764,I had one school nurse say that's what she is pushing for.
16765,"""School is only 9 months a year and we should be masking for flu season anyway""......"
16766,It is true that every other variant has kinda died out.
16767,Where???
16768,"Vaccinated going to hospitals too same rate, and covid killing them same way."
16769,"Problem is, for me/my area at least, antivaxxers are so stubborn that no matter what you present to them they aren't going to get the vaccine."
16770,Just so I wouldn't have to travel somewhere twice.
16771,I'd still prolly tell work I got a 2 dose one so I can take the 2nd day off anyway and tell them I need to recover from side effects.
16772,So it would be a lie to work but they don't ask for proof so thats their fault
16773,Oregon had the strictest masks and social distancing policies in America and it put many businesses and their employees into bankruptcy.
16774,"Look at the situation now, what did all those draconian rules accomplish?"
16775,Now I understand they are going to have an outside mask mandate in a county 60 miles south of Portland.
16776,The Governor of Florida is truly an evil man

16784,"Someone explained above this:    
    
Viral Myocarditis happens at a rate of 10-22 per 100,000 in the general population      
    
The Moderna rate is a potential 12.6 per million."
16785,Or 10x-20x less than getting the virus.
16786,The inflammation is temporary from the vaccine and may not even be noticed.
16787,The damage from Covid 19 is potentially permanent.
16788,"As someone who’s interfaced with overseas resources before, I’ll just say that you get what you pay for and leave it at that."
16789,[deleted]
16790,Yep.
16791,"My hearing is physically fine, but I have auditory processing difficulties with spoken language when there’s background noise, which is uh, always, and lip reading helps."
16792,"I’ve been very disconnected this last year and a half, and while I accept that when masks are actually helping, I can only roll my eyes at the “It’s so great, I want to wear one forever!” people."
16793,The data literally shows that case counts are increasing again.
16794,Are you arguing that the delta of the increase has gone down?
16795,Because there are more cases today than yesterday.
16796,"Maybe they've crested, but Delta proves that it's REALLY hard to keep this in the bottle."
16797,"Movin' to the country,
Gonna eat a lot of peaches"
16798,Vaxxed and klonopined here.
16799,Just doesn’t have the same ring to it…
16800,Those were not hospitalized patients.
16801,"They were sick and felt terrible, but were breathing fine on their own."
16802,The treatment they were waiting for will hopefully keep them out of the hospital entirely.
16803,Apparently Oregon did pass a law a few years ago that if you're in a *really* rural place -- where it would be a burden on the gas station to pay for a full-time attendant -- you can legally pump your own.
16804,The gas station will have signs indicating whether that's the case.
16805,So far the only place I've run into that was in Rome (which has literally the only gas station on a 100+ mile stretch of road) though.
16806,"And then get it again later, and possibly die that time, or just get more damage on top of what you got the last time(s), and then there's the hospital bed availability and keeping other people from getting treatments that aren't covid relates."
16807,That's really not how immunity works.
16808,There are only so many mutations this virus can make that will keep it capable of infecting human hosts.
16809,"I read the article, but I'm still left unclear about costs for things like Regeneron."
16810,Does this vary by state or by insurance company?
16811,By having virtually everyone eligible get vaccinated.
16812,That would have severely reduced the spread of Covid and we wouldn’t be seeing full ICUs in some states.
16813,Try high CBD strains/CBD vapes.
16814,Don’t consume edibles.
16815,"If the anxiety/paranoia persists, consider eliminating cannabis completely and working on a meditation practice."
16816,Try performing dream checks to initiate lucid dreaming.
16817,Practice awareness.
16818,"We have kids, too, and the things that we think are - risks."
16819,"What if something goes wrong, what about the hospitals, what if we can't get in quick enough to our doctor, what about all those first year doctor's appointments - and will we and the new little one be exposed to the virus when we have to go get shots?"
16820,"Being pregnant during this puts the mom's at risk, and to bring a baby into this just seems even more risky."
16821,"And hospital's are filling up, and medical staff are totally burned out and some are quitting."
16822,And what if mom gets covid - can she still breastfeed?
16823,Will she have to quarantine away from her baby?
16824,There's too many unknowns.
16825,"And also when the pandemic first happened, and all the shelves were emptying at the store... that was really scary."
16826,"Supply shortages are having an impact in ways we hadn't really thought of at first, we just don't know what's going on."
16827,"If you don't breastfeed, will there be a steady supply of formula?"
16828,"And just the stress of it all, and do I have enough time and energy to keep up with everything."
16829,"I appreciate that we all feel differently, but man it just seems sort of selfish and way too risky right now to choose on purpose to have a child during all of this."
16830,But I do appreciate that others see it differently.
16831,"I suppose if a woman is a working mom, and was laid-off due to the pandemic, or working remotely now, I can see how it would be tempting."
16832,for what reason?
16833,ease/faster?
16834,As soon as you will remove your lockdown cases will rise again.
16835,And you will immediately have to put another lockdown.
16836,"And again and again and again...until 1 month 1/2 becomes 8 months, then 12 months, then two years."
16837,It's not gonna work.
16838,Lockdowns can  only buy you time.

16851,"How the coronavirus infects cells — and why Delta is so dangerous

https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02039-y

As I understand it:
The one mentioned here (P681R) seems to modify the virus' furin cleavage site."
16852,"This is a part o the S protein which ""activates"" the S protein right before a new virus is released from an infected cell."
16853,"More furin cleavages, more infectious."
16854,"""Two coronavirus variants, Alpha and Delta, have altered furin cleavage sites."
16855,"In the Alpha variant, the initial proline amino acid is changed to a histidine (P681H) ; in the Delta variant, it is changed to an arginine (P681R)."
16856,"Both changes make the sequence less acidic, and the more basic the string of amino acids, the more effectively furin recognizes and cuts it, says Barclay."
16857,"“We would hypothesize that this is the virus getting even better at transmitting.”

More furin cuts mean more spike proteins primed to enter human cells."
16858,"In SARS-CoV, less than 10% of spike proteins are primed, says Menachery, whose lab group has been quantifying the primed spike proteins but is yet to publish this work."
16859,"In SARS-CoV-2, that percentage rises to 50%."
16860,"In the Alpha variant, it’s more than 50%."
16861,"In the highly transmissible Delta variant, the group has found, greater than 75% of spikes are primed to infect a human cell."""
16862,"Not rapidly but yes, compared to where they were a week ago."
16863,"Wearing a mask isn't really  ""huge amounts of precaution"" though."
16864,You're making it seem like people are saying wear a Hazmat suit or walk around like Bubble Boy.
16865,I had to go into the office to pick up a cord.
16866,"I was wearing the worst cut off shorts, a tank top with no bra and my cardigan which was longer than my shorts."
16867,I definitely ran into the CEO.
16868,I still believe that vaccines could have greatly reduced the pandemic here in the states if people had actually went out and got them.
16869,We have far too many people refusing them.
16870,I’m still trying to convince my parents to get jabbed even after my dad’s sister has been in the ICU.
16871,Well we’ve been told the vaccines wane over time.
16872,Israel was among the first in the world to be vaccinated so this surge in cases makes sense.
16873,"The important point is that the vaccines are still protecting against serious illness, hospitalization and death."
16874,"Wow, I just checked and there's nothing for me locally until Sunday."
16875,That's changed within a week.

16942,&gt;Small businesses in particular are not resilient enough to withstand repeated lockdowns and governments can't afford to bail out businesses repeatedly.

16952,"In the US, there's a website where you can find locations that have had the monoclonal antibodies treatments distributed to:

16978,"As far as many people are concerned, life is literally normal."
16979,It’s not until it effects them personally that they actually see what’s going on.
16980,"Even though last winters surge was still brutal, the infection rate of Covid at the time was a lot lower."
16981,"A lot of people never had more than a potential exposure, even the ones flagrantly ignoring masks and social distancing."
16982,"Delta is far more infectious though, even with the vaccines, so a lot of these people who avoided it last year are coming face to face with reality now."
16983,"I have zero pity for people not being vaccinated at this point, but the reality is that a lot more people would probably be more willing to get vaccinated if they actually saw what was going on."
16984,"But in red leaning states, cities, and towns, where people only watch Fox, and their local news station is conservative and avoiding addressing covid… they just aren’t seeing it because their “news” isn’t showing it."
16985,"And most people don’t seek out other news, they don’t check other sources."
16986,They watch their programs and that’s that.
16987,That’s all the source of news they get.
16988,"I think this past year and a half, more than ever, has proven that there needs to be some sort of semblance of regulation in journalism."
16989,Because this shit just isn’t acceptable.
16990,"When the local news doesn’t report that the ICUs are full, that’s a problem."
16991,"When Fox News declares its fake or vaccines are deadly, or whatever literal bullshit they’re peddling, that’s not okay."

17027,"This would still not be an argument against vaccination, because it still makes infections less likely and less severe."
17028,Focusing on breakthrough transmission is a bit misguided when vaccines are proven to be effective at reducing transmission and symptom severity.
17029,"Since the rate of cases increased so quickly, I think that might be part (or most) of the reason hospitalizations are, for now, not at their peak."
17030,"Of course, one could hope that it’s because vaccines are available, but that hasn’t helped other states battling record surges."
17031,Any data on if DNA based vaccines can be better adapted to rapid viral mutations compared to other kinds?

17120,"Poor people with shitty health insurance, $7,000+."
17121,Seems like a fair plan.
17122,"Almost none of what they suggest requires any work on the action of businesses, corporations, or government institutions, which is why the US is always going to constantly fall behind in containing COVID."
17123,"Treating COVID and COVID vaccines as a ""personal responsibility"" issue is why we're in the situation we're in right now."
17124,"Luckily, many corporations are actually taking responsible measures on their own without any prodding from the government, but it still isn't enough."
17125,I also find it personally irritating that this article can't seem to separate the idea of a COVID surge from COVID itself.
17126,"What's going on in the US isn't because of COVID, but because of the failure of public health institutions to have any long-term goals or policies."
17127,"That most likely stems from thinking COVID is just going to disappear on its own (""The pandemic is over!"")"
17128,"and that policy can't have any effect on COVID outcomes, which is far from true."
17129,It's also odd that there's also no mention of the boosters and the extra immunity they might provide for the vaccinated.
17130,&gt;most vaccinated people are still wearing masks in most public places and at the very least aren't going to pitch a fit if someone asks them to wear a mask.
17131,Not my experience.
17132,"Stores here with mask requirements have to deal with all kinds of offended people saying ""but I'm vaccinated!"""
17133,You're not wrong.
17134,"[https://youtu.be/AxfQIRoPjyw](https://youtu.be/AxfQIRoPjyw)

That is the press conference from yesterday and towards the end they open it up for questions and someone specifically asks about that."
17135,It's pretty interesting.
17136,I didn't take it as a pointed question.
17137,I was just answering it.
17138,"City stats show differences based on ethnicity more than anything else:

https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data-vaccines.page#nyc"
17139,"I'm not going to downvote you, but I strongly, strongly disagree."
17140,"The people saying this don't realize how narrow the window for pregnancy really is, and they don't realize just how badly many people want to give birth to children."
17141,"It isn't an ideal time, but for many people (due to their age), this was the best opportunity they were going to get."
17142,"At least your baby will have protection now as well, since who knows when they will get approved for vaccines."
17143,There has to be some sort of fee attached to the covid medical care of the voluntary unvaccinated.
17144,Haha okay okay.
17145,You can be pro-vaccine and anti-vaccine mandate.
17146,How is this any different than young women?
17147,Everyone I know under 35 or so is acting like this doesn’t exist in Philly.
17148,"Maybe it’s because I’m a nurse and work with 90% women so that’s who I know, but everyone I work with has been vacationing and going out like it’s 2019 all summer"
17149,They brought back the mandate in Washington.
17150,It starts on Monday.
17151,"Yes, this is better than opening up prematurely (before herd immunity) and ending up with a massive surge like the US is having now."
17152,China is performing at the very top on the economic side precisely because they don't need to lock down massive numbers of people every time the ICUs are full like here.
17153,The cost of testing and containment is clearly less than the cost of having to shut down their economy.
17154,We should be glad they are taking such a hardline approach since it means they can continue to deliver a reasonable level of goods and supplies to the rest of the world.
17155,Tourism is additionally not heavily impacted _because_ of the containment.
17156,Their domestic tourists replaced international tourism because they could travel freely inside the country for most of the year.
17157,We lost my young nephew to Covid.
17158,"And still family members say the vaccine is stupid, not needed, dangerous."
17159,That's my secret.
17160,I'm always anxious.
17161, Not till mid-September.
17162,And it's supposed to be 8+ months after dose 2.
17163,Our county health official said that Pfizer is on track to submit for EUA by the end of September.
17164,Turn around 4-6 weeks (maybe quicker) so approval and roll out in October (fingers crossed)
17165,"So a cost effective (vaccine) safe treatment exists for this terrible disease, and instead of getting it, tens of thousands of people are “choosing” to get sick, putting tremendous strain (and risk) on our healthcare workers, and then shifting the cost of their poor decisions onto others."
17166,Personal Responsibility (which I keep hearing from the anti vax crowd) should also mean financial responsibility.
17167,&gt; We can't.
17168,I have no idea where we go from here other than just letting the bodies pile up.
17169,Push to have vaccinated people to lawfully receive priority for care when facilities are full.
17170,Encourage exclusion of anti-vaxxers from private spaces (including employment).
17171,Those aren't long-term solutions I guess but we need to normalize treating them like shit given that they are responsible for prolonging this and causing unnecessary suffering and death.
17172,"Yes it will only cause them to dig in even more but they are going to do that anyway, might as well try to make marginal improvements."
17173,Does anybody know if there are issues with getting the booster less than eight months after your full dose of the first round?
17174,My mother just received a booster but it’s only been 5 months.
17175,She said the person giving the shot reviewed her card and said it is not an issue.
17176,I plan on getting a booster but was going by the eight month idea.
17177,Yeahhhhhh….I’m still driving the kids to school.
17178,Or making them walk with me.
17179,Depends on the weather.

17251,I worry about him getting covid constantly now that he's released but I am grateful he got sick weeks ago and not today.
17252,"If he went to the ER today he might have died before getting help (his O2 was 78% when he was admitted, cutting it a little close) due to this hugebsurge of unvaccinated covid patient from our neighboring counties."
17253,For reference my cou ty is over 80% vaccinated while our neighbors fall into the 20-35% range....

17257,There is almost no support for parents who are in this situation right now unless you have one parent who can stay home with your child all day.
17258,Remote learning options have been axed across the country and offices are demanding people come back.
17259,We'd also have 1918's attitude towards disease and death.
17260,"People routinely died from not just diseases which we can prevent with vaccines and fancy technology, but from fairly minor injuries which became infected due to the lack of antibiotics."
17261,"Although at the rate that we've been driving antibiotic resistance (through their overuse), those days may be returning again within the next few decades...."
17262,"While the data on natural immunity isn't rock solid, and we know that re-infection does occur, it's possible the sky high infection rates of early 2020 in NYC have enough folks walking around with enough antibodies to keep things from getting out of control."

17291,"People above are talking about when the pandemic will end, not an elimination or eradication of COVID."
17292,Might be worth looking into high CBD/low-THC strains.
17293,In the past I've used a 1:1 ratio of THC/CBD and it worked really well for me.
17294,I found tinctures and edibles worked better for me and didn't cause the anxiety and paranoia that inhalation might since it comes on more slowly.
17295,There's a strain called Cherry CBD that is 2:1(ish) CBD to THC.
17296,In my experience strains with higher CBD help to combat some of the anxiety/paranoia that pure THC strains would cause.

17368,"I'm in VA. Fairfax is one of the largest school systems, so this is good news."
17369,Happy to see the article mentions some other districts have already taken this step as well.
17370,Our district is small and unlikely to take this step unless it's mandated at a state level or all the districts around us have a vax mandate.
17371,"Still, it's progress in the right direction."
17372,"On top of what others have said, a lot of local health departments have taken it upon themselves to keep track of vaccinations."
17373,The County Health Department where I live (Southwest Missouri) started tracking daily cases and breaking it down by vaccination status.
17374,"We're on the tail end of our summer peak (hopefully), so we're seeing about 85-95% on a daily basis still unvaccinated."
17375,Now the vaccination rate in the county is poor (25% fully vaccinated.
17376,"The City I live in (Joplin) has it's own health department and is around 49% fully vaccinated with 57% started their first dose), but if the vaccines were ineffective, you'd expect to see something like 25% of the cases be vaccinated, but you don't."
17377,It's probably about half that.
17378,"Reinfections, and by reinfections I assume not genetic sequencing but simply asking ""Did you have covid before?"
17379,""", account for even less than that around here."
17380,"Now, will vaccinated breakthroughs go up in places where there is a lot of vaccination?"
17381,"Of course, but you still will see a matter of overall cases trending down."

17388,"This is all the result of misinformation and disinformation, a total inability to gauge the accuracy of that information, a culture that promotes toxic individualism, years of growing (and occasionally justified) distrust of institutions, and a media landscape that thrives on polarization."
17389,There's so much to unpack here that I don't even know where to begin.
17390,I’m curious to know if 3rd shots will also lead to an increase in the myocarditis cases.
17391,Israel was the first to detect it in younger men after their 2nd shot.
17392,"Hang in there, it'll get better."
17393,At least that's what I keep trying to tell myself to push on through.
17394,"In reality, who knows."
17395,"Eh, I never thought COVID was going to disappear in any meaningful fashion *unless* a majority of people were vaccinated."
17396,"I remember thinking that it was lucky that the original strains of COVID didn't spread as easily because so many Americans just didn't care about the vaccines; cases started to decline with just a small amount of people getting immunity, it was great!"
17397,But the fact is that vaccines are preventive tools and not cures.
17398,"Given that COVID is a disease that comes and goes in waves, it would only make sense to try to urgently get as many people as vaccinated as possible before the next wave comes."
17399,"Herd immunity is a group effort and not an individual task, which is why it was so frustrating to see the CDC constantly forgetting to assert that if we want herd immunity and normalcy, that means that almost every adult needs to be vaccinated."
17400,But that's not the message that was put out and we wasted several months fighting about masking instead of focusing on reaching herd immunity.
17401,"They keep saying herd immunity is not possible with Delta, but I don't know."
17402,"To me, it just sounds like a copout for not really having any overall plan to deal with Delta."
17403,"Maybe instead of publishing these pithy articles, certain organizations actually need to come together and actually make long-term goals."
