0,"&gt; Yes, and you know why?"
1,Because a CDC study found that a higher rate of infection was among those who wore cloth masks.
2,A higher rate of infection than medical polypropylene masks in a health care setting.
3,Not a higher rate of infection than no mask at all.
4,It does not then follow that cloth masks shouldn't be used at all.
5,"Not everyone has $60 up front to order disposable masks in bulk, and multiple studies have concluded that cloth masks are definitely better than nothing at all."
6,[Apparently you agree with this position when it suits your purpose.
7,"](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/pts290/federal_court_antivaxxers_do_not_have_a/hf0py5a/)  

&gt; Did that really need to be spelled out for you?"
8,"It's clear you're interested in an argument, not a good faith discussion."
9,You're [this guy](http://wondermark.com/1k62/) but with an extra dollop of rudeness.
10,I won't be responding to any of your replies from now on.
11,You have a good and long life.
12,"Complete total worldwide lockdown, so no, not possible"
13,I live alone have a google doc I will share with my parents (who live nearby) so they can see me update it in real time if I get covid.
14,They will do the same.
15,My mom said it would make her a lot less anxious.
16,"It would make me feel better if they got sick, too."
17,"Date/time column, O2 sat,  food I ate, drink, temperature, meds taken, current symptoms, a note if I’m going to bed for the night and one when I wake up, etc."
18,Glad to hear that ma'am...
19,(kidding!!)
20,"I think a helpful tidbit is that we’ve never seen vaccine side effects pop up more than 8 weeks after administration, ever."
21,"The “what if, in 10 years…?” is a boogeyman."
22,"We have 6+ months of data for millions of people now, the chance of new safety signals occurring is so minuscule it’s not a thing to consider."
23,"We have no suspicions, no proposed biological mechanism."
24,Is there anyway to fully eliminate covid?
25,I mean billions have this vaccine but many still in hospitals.
26,Is there any hope for that still?
27,[removed]
28,I would just send an email to up the chain and leave it alone.
29,That protects her in case something blows up.
30,"If she can, just find a new place to work."
31,I honestly don't think that it's worth the hassle and would just find another job.
32,Define 'workers' .
33,Doctors?
34,Nurses?
35,Or other.
36,There's been some controversy about that over the years.
37,"Sounds like it may not prevent the most serious outcomes (hospitalization, pneumonia, etc) but it may reduce the length of typical influenza symptoms."
38,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/does-tamiflu-work-we-asked-a-scientist
39,That still counts as the flu killing them though
40,You day that now but wouldn't have said that for the majority of 2020 and early 2021.
41,I saw a suggestion somewhere online that rapid antigen tests are no good if you're vaccinated.
42,Is that right?
43,I'm going to an event next weekend where everyone is being asked to be vaxxed and tested.
44,Will I need to get a PCR test instead?
45,"Long-term side effects of COVID are even more unstudied (vaccination is easier to study since you know exactly who's gotten a dose, and more people have now been vaccinated than have caught covid) and far more likely to be serious."
46,Friend said at her work they had a rule.
47,If there was an exposure event vaccinated people like her got a notice.
48,Anyone who wasn't vaccinated had to take two weeks quarantine.
49,She said she'd get a notice of exposure.
50,And  then the same two problematic coworkers would take an unscheduled absence for two weeks.
51,[removed]
52,She might say this to make you less sad when she dies
53,The rise of Trump is what made me initially get interested in cults.
54,I saw all these people I knew falling in line for someone who was so clearly a conman and it was the only explanation that made any sense.
55,I think we need to make some significant societal changes to make room for these impressionable people to find a positive niche in our communities rather than being led astray by some grifter.
56,The ability of people to silo themselves into information bubbles and only be exposed to certain ideas is something that needs to change as well.
57,There’s always another Trump waiting in the wings to grift some disconnected soul of their money and good sense.
58,"Exactly, i love my 5 weeks as much as the next guy but getting more than 2 weeks at a time approved is not very common and 3 is the absolute max in most situations."
59,I'm sure exceptions exist but they are rare.
60,Yeah I took him to the doctor the morning he developed symptoms and I assumed it was covid but he tested negative for that and positive for the flu.
61,He usually gets a flu shot around the middle of October but apparently the flu is going around here now.
62,[removed]
63,It needs to be taken within 48 hours of the first symptom to have any effect.
64,"So if he took it right away and was getting better only a day later, it probably helped."
65,So can anyone help me with advice for this.
66,My wife is an RN and the nursing services are letting covid positive asymptomatic nurses/doctors still work around patients.
67,My wife complained and they told her it wasn’t her place to question this and that they are short staffed.
68,Is there anyway I can go above this?
69,Local news or something?
70,The 3ms are the best!
71,Comfortable and really easy to get a seal.
72,"I had a couple left over from last pollen season, and really hated that period of time (2020) when I had to settle for other brands!"
73,Cool thanks for the answer
74,Empowerment videos for people in the foot community.
75,It’s an anti-viral medication you would take after testing positive.
76,It’s  a bit like tamiflu for the flu.
77,"oh, sorry, I saw J&amp;J/Pfizer/Moderna and assumed US."
78,"In your country, what dosage are they using for boosters?"
79,Moderna has proposed 50 micrograms (half the current dosage for shots 1 &amp; 2) to the FDA.
80,Hopefully less in the way of side effects from that.
81,Source on the toxicity?
82,Seriously.
83,He was nothing but a punch line for as long as I can remember.
84,A gold-plated turd.
85,I wouldn't draw conclusions from those three numbers.
86,All three confidence intervals overlap.
87,What's the word on the 2 to 5 year olds?
88,I do agree that we need policies to incentivize healthy meals.
89,"But, its is not once a month or even once a week All you can eat that will make you obese."
90,My son is taking tamiflu right now so I just wanted to be sure.
91,He started it the day he started having symptoms and by the next day he was starting to feel better but I’ve heard from other people it didn’t work for them so maybe it’s just a coincidence?
92,Another thing to consider.
93,A lot of folks go from being okay (stable) to respiratory distress very rapidly.
94,If you live alone see if you can have a friend or family member check on you frequently.
95,"You could arrange to send a text to someone at an agreed upon time or have someone call you, etc."
96,"Not trying to be a mother hen, but I live completely alone so anytime I do something potentially dangerous (like work on the roof) I always let someone know what I’m up to and set a time to call them."
97,Go team!
98,Is tamiflu minimally effective?
99,"I get tamiflu whenever anyone in my house gets sick with flu, haven't caught it yet."
100,I also get vaxxed too.
101,"Anecdotal I know, but I hate getting the flu."
102,Will they even take the pill in time though?
103,Most of them don't even believe Covid is that serious.
104,And the pill isn't effective for people who are already seriously ill.
105,"I can see a bunch of them flat out thinking ""it's just a cold"" until it's too late."
106,I love going to sporting events.
107,Already went to two Raiders games this season.
108,There's nothing wrong with going to sports events.
109,It's a big part of many people's lives.

111,"I have occipital neuralgia and on Facebook groups that I’m in, there are more and more people joining after having Covid."

119,This is the first I’m hearing of this.
120,Is this something you would take when infected already or is this more preventative like the vaccine?
121,It doesn't broadly mutate RNA.
122,Coronaviruses and all other RNA-based viruses carry the code to make a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
123,"We don't have these in our body because we never want to make RNA from RNA, only RNA from DNA."
124,The protein incorporates this fake nucleoside which causes errors in the replicated RNA.
125,My grandmother and her sister survived the 1918 flu but it killed their entire family.

147,"Forgive me for being sceptical, but who is the source for collating all this data?"
148,Didn’t even remember I got the vaccine until I started doing more research on what I’ve been going through
149,I'm in NY and a local district did this too.... because parents complained saying it was too many notifications and they don't want to be repeatedly reminded there is a pandemic.
150,I can't with these people.
151,Yeah I have a friend with a needle phobia and she also has Xanax literally just to get vaccines (flu shot every year and now covid shot).
152,It's still stressful for her but she tries to think of it as avoiding the possibility of even MORE needles in the hospital.
153,"Covid already does have many well-known long term symptoms, that are not even particularly rare."
154,"Year long loss of smell and taste, or fatigue, or disrupted sleep?"
155,No thanks.
156,These can even occur to kids (which is why mortality is not the whole story).
157,The vaccine seems like the obvious choice here.
158,It's different.
159,Tamiflu (Oseltamivir) is just an enzyme inhibiter and prevents certain types of influenza viruses from exiting infected cells (therefore preventing them from further infecting additional cells).
160,It's also only minimally to moderately effective.
161,Molnupiravir works by deliberately introducing copying errors into the virus' RNA.
162,"So if that somehow ends up introducing copying errors into your own DNA... well, that's obviously bad news."
163,Can confirm.
164,Vaccinated because I care about other people and this seems like a horrible way to die.
165,"Other than protecting myself and others, I’m vaccinated because I love food and losing my sense of smell would send me into a spiral of depression."
166,I’m not sure what that means in this context.

168,[removed]
169,just on the same tip: the Federal government gave Alabama money for the health and wellbeing of their constituents and their best judgment for the resources is to increase incarceration :face palm:
170,Tamiflu works differently so it shouldn’t cause cancer
171,"I don’t have anything to add to your question - but I did want to say that the answers you are getting are such a nice change of pace from all the quackery elsewhere (horse paste, vitamin whatever, etc etc etc)."
172,Not sure why you’re getting downvoted.
173,Do masks suck?
174,Absolutely.
175,Are they effective?
176,"Also, absolutely."
177,"I think masking can be done away with after:
-	Children down to 6-months can be vaccinated  
-	There’s sufficient time to implement that for those parents willing to get the vaccine (a month or so?)"
178,"After that, sure, remove the masking."
179,"At that point, anyone not vaccinated is by choice with the exception of children and, unfortunately, that’s going to be the case no matter what."
180,"Masking will become a choice of personal protection, which I’m good with."
181,"For example, we’ll go back to wearing them if the area becomes a hotspot."
182,Or if we’re going to be somewhere that will likely house a large population of unvaccinated individuals.
183,Other countries have been wearing masks in consideration of others for years prior to this - not sure why the US has to be such babies about it.

318,Just got back from Publix and literally everyone around us was masked.
319,Mostly I noticed because my daughter was hungry so she started pulling her mask off demanding to eat and I was explaining to her that she had to put it back on until we were outside.
320,So I pointed to other people around us to explain it and was pleasantly surprised that not a single person was unmasked.

Crazy that public figures have to actually verbalize such statements."
337,For some reason Americans have a hard time grasping the concept of disease prevention at the population level vs disease treatment at the individual level.
338,Maybe add “people in small towns not looking into posts” fracturing communities.
339,"Yeah, yikes."
340,"But hey, if there’s value in those drugs great, let’s do some research and find out."

396,Could have lived to become the oldest human since biblical times.. Covid didn’t have to kill her.
397,This seems reasonable.
398,Your parents are older so at a higher risk for getting sicker even if vaccinated.
399,So limiting the party to vaccinated friends seems smart.

409,They actually tried to treat him as truant for having a very well documented disabling illness for which he has an IEP.
410,They just can’t adjust to the idea a kid can keep doing all the work even while sick.
411,The point of being vaccinated is to significantly lower the risk of serious illness and death.
412,Maybe your Dad doesn’t want to risk getting infected at all?
413,I know people who are being extremely careful because they are high risk and want nothing to do with this virus.
414,"You should ask him his reasons, maybe he has extra risk factors in addition to being male and over sixty?"

430,Why do you think Russia is involved with this?
431,Wouldn't they want every country close to them vaccinated to stop international transmission?
432,Especially since they have their own vaccine which means a great soft-power influence?

434,"No

Shit

435,It’s actually a really small amount of employees.
436,The article specifies 0.5% for one hospital and just under 1% for another.
437,About 5% got some sort of medical or religious exemption.
438,"That means over 94% or so health care workers overall did end up getting vaccinated, which is fantastic news and restores some faith in humanity!"

453,I'm double vaxxed and just got over Covid.
454,I live in a small town on the southern Oregon coast and I called around everywhere trying to find out if I could get the Monoclonal antibodies and I had NO luck at all.
455,Had one Dr. want to give me Hydroxycloroqyine 🙄.
456,It's ridiculous that my area did not have the option to even offer the Monoclonal therapy.
457,"When I saw a few days ago they were going to require anyone with natural immunity to get a booster after 6 months I figured it wasn't going to be long before they required a booster for the regular vaxxed folks, too."
458,It's nice to see a country actually following where the science leads them during this pandemic.
459,Imagine that.
460,I wouldn’t want unvaccinated people around my older family tbh.
461,Delta spreads so quick and it make even vaccinated older people pretty sick and at an indoor party there’s a lot of chances to spread if someone is infected.
462,We don’t know anything about your family situation but I don’t think it’s unreasonable.
463,Wouldn’t it be so easy for them to not have a party at all?
464,"Is it people not getting it, or is it the vaccine not being available?"
465,"Was talking to a friend from Uzbekistan, and at least there, it's available, but extremely expensive."
466,Could factor in.
467,"Briefly: mid-range positions like QA, in an industry that is traditionally underpaid."

469,"Last week, I spent time with a friend and her significant other (who is unvaccinated)."
470,"This person isn't a pandemic denialist (she wears a mask everywhere) but I believe she is extremely concerned about how the vaccine might impact pregnancy (my friend and her are thinking about having a child through surrogacy, and she will carry the baby)."
471,My friend said that it has been a point of consternation for her that her significant other refuses to get vaccinated.
472,I didn't say anything since it's not my place to judge.
473,All I can say is that I hope unvaccinated people are at least aware of the possible consequences of not being vaccinated.

476,Over 82% of Canadian kids aged 12-17 have had at least one dose.

478,"And, it's something to be used as a backstop for breakthrough infections in people who are vaccinated."
479,"It's one-two punch of a highly effective vaccine, plus an antiviral where, if you get a breakthrough infection, your doctor says: Stay home, rest, take this as prescribed."
480,"Together, they would radically reduce the demand for hospitalization."

485,"I suspect they didn't try, didn't make it an issue."
486,The national vaccination rate is 65% for nursing home staff (too low IMHO) and 85% for residents.
487,"I would also expect more in WA since we were hit hard first in the USA, in our nursing homes."
488,I hope people remain calm and actually look at the numbers on both sides to do a proper cost-benefit analysis with regards to which vaccines the kids should be taking and at what ages.

521,Can't imagine the guilt I would have of something happened to my kids because I was being hard headed about something that isnt a big deal to begin with

610,I just read an article in USA today that said experts are optimistic of recovery from long Covid.
611,It sounds like long Covid may not last for the rest of your life that it’s symptoms simply lingering for a longer period of time.
612,Are there any medical journals or studies that can support the article?
613,I’d love to see data and research for it!
614,"russia is literally weaponising social media against the US and there is STILL no counter attack or mechanism to stop them, I wonder how long until this issue starts to get taken seriously"
615,Yep Melbourne's lockdown in 2020 saved Australia.
616,"And in 2021

1) The government stuffed up purchasing vaccines by only purchasing Astra Zenica (Where they had a financial interest), causing the vaccine rollout to be delayed

2) Melbourne Vaccines went to (and are still going to Sydney)."
617,This also caused the lockdown to drag again.

635,It worked well for Australia.
636,"They suppressed past variants, and the current wave is happening while most of the population has been vaccinated."
637,Their deaths per capita is tiny compared to most countries.
638,Are you aware that Australia has had trouble securing vaccine supply?
639,As an under 40 year old I was only able to access my first dose at the start of September and have only just been given access to my second dose as of today.
640,We are opening up as vaccine coverage increases.
641,Vaccination rates are pretty huge ~1% per day at the moment.
642,I think there is some nuance missing in the international reporting.
643,"As soon as it became apparent that we were unable to suppress Delta, covid 0 was abandoned and restrictions have been  slowly easing with many restrictions planned to be removed by early November (at least where I live)."
644,Covid zero worked pre Delta so I am not sure if it is fair to say it was foolish.
645,For six months of the year life here was pretty much back to normal as there was zero covid in the community.
646,This was a double edged sword as it meant that there was complacency when it come to securing vaccine supply.
647,Which pretty much explains why we are where we are.
648,[deleted]
649,FWIW a 3 does regimen actually looks a lot like the HPV vaccine in regards to timing.
650,The resemblance is uncanny.
651,It’s hardly unprecedented  or unexpected.
652,We know the vaccine is safe and effective.
653,The big unknown is long term effectiveness and optimal dosage.
654,We knew going in it was likely at least a 3rd shot would be needed.
655,The debate was when and if it could be the same vaccine or reformulated.
656,We still might need a reworked 4th dose at some point.
657,If that’s the whole population of just more vulnerable people is an open question.
658,"Moderna bet on one dosage, Pfizer bet on another."
659,A post epidemic analysis will show who was really “better”.
660,Pfizer shipping more doses or Moderna on stronger doses.
661,Hopefully we’ll learn something for next time.
662,No...
663,I cannot afford to leave my job as most teachers cannot.
664,But I wish they do better for children .

666,Get back to work you peasants!
667,"This is a ridiculous, stereotypical comment."
668,"I live in a city, but commute to work in a rural area and you’ll be amazed at the many business owners and educated community leaders in those spots, making plenty of money."
669,This is a caricature.
670,This has been my experience.
671,Father (in his 60s) and son (in his 30s) catch covid and both unvaxed.
672,Father dies and son changes his mind.
673,However in the waiting period to get the vaccine after being covid positive (I think it’s 90 days) son changes his mind because dad probably died of something else.
674,My dad died from COVID last year.
675,And the kicker is my wife has a PharmD (Doctorate in Nuclear Pharmacy) and a Bachelors in Biophysics.
676,He wouldn't listen.
677,I just don't get it.
678,"Sorry for the family's loss, it's a tragedy in the purest form."

684,[FDA's advisory committee meets on the 26th for kids shots.
685,](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/01/fda-meetings-kid-covid-vaccines-514897)  Probably a few days later they'll make a final decision.
686,"&gt; In my district (I am a teacher)

Firstly, thank you."
687,"Secondly, are you thinking about transferring to another district or state?"
688,"The vaccine is available just fine, it’s possible to get a shot at the mall or at a clinic."
689,There are several issues with that.
690,A) lots of antivaxers even amongst medical staff.
691,B) 2 out of 3 available vaccines simply don’t work.
692,"Well, to be exact, Covivac seems to work, but poorly, they didn’t publish anything but the safety report, no efficacy study."
693,"The other one Epivac is a complete scam judging from the lack of published studies, no detectable antibodies after the jab and people’s own research."
694,"So there are 3 vaccines on the market, and only one works."
695,It’s hard for people to trust these options.
696,"(Sputnik light also works, but it’s mostly recommended for revaccination)."
697,"C) the danger of COVID is not portrayed all that consistently in the media, lots of outlets keep singing the tune that kids don’t get too sick and it’s just a mild flu, the stats in most cities don’t even try to reflect the real situation."
698,"Moscow has more or less ‘true’ numbers, but other cities don’t."
699,My city has been publishing flatline 20-25 deaths a day for months now.
700,If that is the case does that mean if people don’t want vaccine or doesn’t really stop covid cause it can still spread?
701,I’m only 13 and don’t do much reading but if someone takes the vaccine and someone doesn’t but the person who decides not to take it  is ok with the vaccinated and just gas his opinion on it but the vaccinated person calls him the ass hole and death threat who is the asshole my grammar is bad so idk if you could read it correctly
702,Walmart is the big thief here.
703,I'm alright with what this guy did.
704,"Personally, I also feel stealing is morally wrong, but given the circumstances, and the items taken, dude tried."
705,He's probably not thrilled to have had to steal diapers.
706,"In raw case numbers, possibly."
707,"But, as someone else mentioned, case numbers when a large percentage of the population is vaccinated don't lead to the same numbers of deaths."
708,"Delaying the impact and giving time to get people immunised was the whole point - and, look, it was not exactly an easy ride but it was overall successful."
709,And the vast majority of Australia spent pretty much the whole of 2020 and the first half of 2021 without thinking much about the pandemic and without any impact whatsoever.
710,Whose incompetence?
711,"The cashier, the payment terminal, or the credit card company?"
712,Want to know what to do in the emergency where you *do* need to steal from a store?
713,"You write an IOU and describe what you took, who you are and when you will pay it back."
714,Anything less than that is begging for a prosecution worth a lot more than the cost of diapers.
715,"Hope that means treating those who took care to vaccinate themselves before those who decided to ""take their chances"""

719,My daughter gets it!
720,She knows that it will keep her and others safe.
721,Kids at risk more than ever.
722,I want to say this.
723,In my district (I am a teacher) they are not requiring children get tested unless they show signs.
724,Which means children who are asymptomatic will likely spread it without warning.
725,"Our classrooms are not deep cleaned, children do not keep on their mask, and most of the classrooms the children are not 6 feet a part."
726,I think there will be many more.
727,"I think that you replied to the wrong comment, but I am a librarian."

731,There are plenty of jobs everywhere I look.
732,And there are lot of people that were deemed necessary to keep working their crappy jobs this whole time.
733,They’re not staying home on unemployment to avoid a pandemic anymore.
734,They’re traveling and socializing as if everything is fine.
735,Get a job!
736,Father of two.
737,This is fucking heartbreaking.
738,I'm with ya
739,Hmmm not sure there’s any hope for my in-laws.
740,Apparently they think everyone who’s been vaccinated will drop dead in two years.
741,🤷🏻‍♀️
742,"My daughter is terrified of shots, so I sent her to a therapist that has has experience with helping kids through medical procedures."
743,I’m not doing a great job of explaining myself.
744,Ha.
745,"I don’t mean mental health, more accepting covid is going to exist and psychologically moving on."
746,"How can you go from zero covid (ish, at least as goal) to endemic covid."
747,I live somewhere with a lot of covid anxiety esp for the US and it’s really it’s own beast.
748,My state opened up in June when we hit 70% and then When delta hit it all went to shit.
749,"Idk I hope for your success, I just don’t know that it’s going to be as smooth as ppl think, based on what happened here"
750,"Took me almost two months, I couldn’t taste or smell anything"
751,"Happy to talk, don’t consider myself “one of these fucking idiots”, I’m interested in data and having a hellva time finding it."
752,Starting to feel as though most sites are using Covid as click bait.
753,Can u help me?

762,Scary times.
763,"Rest In Peace, young man."
764,Oh!
765,Thank you so much
766,"I'm saying at some point the cost exceeds the benefit (and the world agrees, as we don't lockdown for the flu season, even though that would prevent the deaths)."
767,NZ had to shut down many basic freedoms (even outside the lockdown periods) to prevent not that many deaths.
768,"Of course it sucks people die, and you can prevent most deaths with less harsh interventions and you should."
769,And then you go after the small amount of remaining deaths and attempt to prevent those with harsh measures.
770,I would take the Nordic option (excluding Sweden who went a different way) over the NZ/AUS strategy in a heartbeat.
771,Indoctrinating then early

779,There are always eager replacements.
780,"With only 48% of adults vaccinated, it looks like they are in for a devastating wave."
781,They only had 29 new cases today!
782,What are they thinking?
783,"Many places avoided overcrowded ICUs and most deaths without telling citizens abroad they are not allowed to come home, and without attempting elimination in general."
784,It's not the US way or the NZ way.
785,"Yes, in New Zealand excess deaths are negative, they did prevent flu and traffic deaths along with covid deaths, but the other option is not just letting it spread."
786,"I'm really happy to be in a Nordic country where measured restrictions kept deaths close to a bad flu season level, and noone had to be told they can't go home."
787,"The disinformation you and your type are spreading is actually costing lives, please shut up."
788,It is nanometers in size - never thought it was possible unless you banned all forms of human movement over your borders - even North Korea can't do that.
789,"The Spanish flu also mutated to be more deadly, it was in the second wave that young people in their prime began dieing from it in large numbers"
790,"Agreed, it would have been a much better strategy if other countries had embraced it as well, and right from the beginning."

803,"I see what you're saying, but aiming for zero permanently will have massive costs."
804,"It makes sense as an initial response strategy IMO, but as soon as a virus is globally circulating I think ""elimination"" in a given area is just a holding pattern."
805,"It ends once vaccination becomes widely available in that area; or (in a more grim no-vaccine scenario) immunity builds from everyone having been previously infected; or in most of the world now, a combination of the two."
806,New Zealand is in the admittedly tricky situation now where they are entirely reliant on vaccination rather than the combo of prior infections + vaccination.
807,It will be interesting to see how that plays out.
808,"The reality of a permanent ""zero"" strategy is permanent border restrictions, gathering restrictions, and the threat of lockdowns."
809,"It was never going to be politically tenable as an end-goal for any liberal democracy, and New Zealand now admitting that signals the end of it as a strategy IMO."

829,Thanks to all grown ups that don't feel the need to vaccinate.
830,You’re 100% wrong.

839,"Before the pandemic, it felt like nurses were pretty well respected, we did our own thing, people trusted us…
THEN we were HeRoEs; it was a lot, we were just doing our jobs…
Now?"
840,These anti-vax &amp; anti-mask mouth-breathers are putting a *stain* on the profession.
841,They don’t speak for the vast majority of us.
842,I have a 7 yo who tested positive for Covid last week after sitting at the lunch table at school with a kid who tested positive.
843,"Seen stories like this before and I was freaked the fuck out, could barely sleep."
844,We got him another test the next day because he was asymptomatic and it came back negative.
845,"We got him another one a week later, negative again."
846,I think it was a false positive the first time but it still scared the shit out of me.
847,"Even though odds are super high that he comes out unscathed, as a parent anything less than 100% is fucking scary."
848,Parts of Australia*.
849,My state has had about 30 days of lockdown total throughout the pandemic and 7 deaths in total.
850,Yeah the state borders have been closed but the day to day reality of the pandemic has been that life has gone one normally.
851,My kids missed about 5 days of daycare total due to the pandemic and I’ve only had to wear a mask in the last few months since we’ve been putting out delta spot fires.
852,The state is at 50% vaccinated and should reach 80% by early November.
853,"Once we reach that level the restrictions come down and we’ll probably will all get covid at some point, but we won’t have the health system collapsing and runaway death / disability numbers."
854,No the numbers stagnated for 2 weeks in Level 4 with numbers rising again before it was lifted.
855,"It got into the gang community who weren't following the rules at all, so staying in Level 4 another couple weeks would not have eliminated the outbreak."

857,I'm so sorry that your kids are going through that.
858,I really hope that there will be more progress in treating long covid as we start to understand it better.
859,Wishing all the best for you and your family.
860,Heck I worked the entire time - my work was essential.
861,Our wages were frozen the year before covid came about.
862,We were already slow because of the tariffs our ex president placed on China that created the trade war.
863,It killed our manufacturing even though we buy US sourced steel and iron.
864,"Anyway, we have yet to get a raise and all these entry level jobs are posting hiring signs making close to what I am after being at my place for almost 10 years."
865,"I also have an engineering degree and the company sent us to school for machining, so I have my associates in that too."
866,"I feel that in a few more years, if I keep working here, I will be making whatever minimum (hiring) wage for every other company will be by then."
867,"Oh but hey, we have supposedly “world class” medical insurance that we have to have through the company that takes almost half our check for its premiums, that you have to fight with the insurance company to pay your doctor bills every time you get sick and have to go to the hospital or doctors office."
868,DO NOT even think about going to the emergency room.
869,Even if it is an emergency.
870,"You had better be dying before you go there because our insurance claims they have a $500 copay that has to be paid upfront, but later they send you the rest of the bill too if they deem it not enough of a life or death situation."
871,I am getting sick of this whole country truthfully.
872,Their policies suck and the business owners are generally greedy and expect you to work for chump change while you struggle to pay for housing and food…
873,As a parent with kids at home who can’t get vaccinated yet due to age this shit terrifies me.

878,That makes it 0 countries that have successfully eliminated covid.

880,"Whilst I agree that there is more that people can do for their health, reasons for unhealthy behaviour are complex and often involve impaired mental health and opportunity for more healthy activities; access to both has been impaired during the pandemic, and people need more support going forward."
881,Thank you for your civil response 🙂
882,"Yeah, having kids the same age, this really hits home."
883,The vaccination for younger children needs to come and soon.
884,Nothing of the sort.
885,Only that it is inadvisable to voice that kind of negativity because it hurts the vaccine effort and it also leads one into the same dark corner inhabited by the anti-vaxxers.

898,They were partying while the world was dealing with all the mess
899,I think they are actually trying to avoid hospitals overrun right now.

915,&gt; What's Australia's next move?
916,"Well, the next moves are pretty well detailed in the government's plan, and they depend basically on vaccination numbers."
917,"International borders will start reopening in November, initially only for states where 80%+ of the eligible population is vaccinated."
918,Individual states have their own roadmaps for when their internal restrictions are reduced.
919,"Exactly, and that's why it annoys me how sainted Jacinda has been in the global press, because I think luck has played the major role up until this point."
920,"Like you say, unless you're willing to go full China, widespread covid is an inevitability eventually, she knows that, her advisors and ministers know that, Ashley Bloomfield knows that."
921,So then why did they spend so long not being frank about that?
922,"Why did they bumble vaccine procurement (whilst spinning bullshit about how it was actually a virtuous act because ""other places need it more)?"
923,"How on Earth did they not have health departments, and all other sectors of society, properly informed on a long term end-goal so that they could have spent the time they avoided covid preparing properly, rather than now having to do it in a panicked rush once an outbreak had already begun?"
924,A government that plans based on optimistic hopes that they'll just continue to avoid an outbreak seems naive to me tbh.
925,"Just days before this outbreak began she was pushing a fantasy that NZ would maintain elimination whilst ""reconnecting with the world""."
926,Of course even that chat had next to no detail or parameters.
927,I'm thankful that NZ has been covid free for long periods the rest of the world hasn't been.
928,My parents are there and many of my most dear friends and loved ones.
929,But I've been saying all along that was not a stable end-point and the government not admitting that seemed likely to cause problems once reality inevitably hit eventually.
930,That time has now arrived it seems.
931,Seen it here too.

952,And people use GDP to get how rich a countries is like india can spend more then Denmark.
953,I know what you are trying to say but the logic you are using is a bit ignorant.
954,I was not aware the demand on the hospitals have subsided here.
955,At least not in heavily Republican states.
956,The unvaccinated are still flooding the hospitals and some areas have even put hold on non emergency surgeries and procedures again because of it.
957,Also private health care in the US is an absolute joke.
958,I think New Zealand and other countries like it took the view that they could continue to hold off outbreaks like they did with the previous variants until their populations were sufficiently vaccinated and so they didn't need to rush to make preparations.
959,"In practice, they haven't been able to hold off outbreaks for as long as they hoped and there isn't really any way to change this without going to China levels of outbreak control, they don't have the addition of natural immunity and combined natural and vaccination immunity to protect themselves, and because much of the population has not experienced the effects of covid on the ground they're likely to see higher vaccine hesitancy."
960,Getting the first jab--great.
961,We all did it except for the anti-vaxxers.
962,"But you're right, the science is telling us that's not enough now."
963,Most of us here will step up and get our boosters when our name is called.

968,There’s a difference between preventable risk and unpreventable risk.
969,I can’t prevent being struck by lightning.
970,I can’t do anything reasonable to mitigate that.
971,[Lightning can literally come out of nowhere from miles away with no warning](https://www.11alive.com/mobile/article/news/verify/danger-of-lightning-and-how-far-it-reaches/85-cb5ebb4a-fb92-4979-8ad4-90fb27ada4ec).
972,I can do something about my risk to my child contracting COVID.
973,"They can wear a mask, they can wash their hands, they can social distance, etc."
974,So pointing out that the risk is the same odds as being struck by lightning isn’t actually helpful.
975,"Plus, that risk assessment doesn’t take into account the fact that different areas have higher concentrations of COVID than others."
976,So some people are actually more likely to catch COVID than others purely because COVID exists in higher numbers around them (and because less people follow safety precautions around them).

979,"&gt; However, Chatterjee’s greatest concern is that the efficacy figure given for the above 60 age group, which is the most vulnerable section of the population, is said to be 67.8% but the confidence interval bands within which it’s located stretch from 8% to 90%."
980,**He believes that’s an incredibly wide range which makes the 67.8% figure almost meaningless.
981,"**

&gt; Chatterjee also agreed that there are two further Covaxin Phase 3 efficacy results where the confidence intervals are worryingly wide."
982,The 65.2% efficacy against the Delta variant has a confidence interval stretching from 33.1% to 83%.
983,The confidence interval for 93.4% efficacy against severe COVID-19 stretches from 57.1% to 99.8%.
984,"&gt; “Efficacy is very important,” Chatterjee said."
985,"“If it stretches between 8 and 90% then that clearly means the 67.8 figure is not reliable.”

1224,"An unvaxxed person can also stay home when they are sick and delta variant doesn’t seem to differ in spread from vaxxed or unvaxxed, as the vaccines aren’t designed for the delta variant or other variants."
1225,"On top of that the efficacy of vaccines have shone to wane after 4-6 months so the protections of vaccine have a window, being vaccinated a year ago doesn’t mean much more than someone unvaccinated, the risk of ICU is pretty exclusive towards those with co morbidities particularly obese and elderly populations, the likelihood of young physically fit/active people getting hospitalized is small enough to consider statistically insignificant."
1226,Yeah I explained further in another comment but I think you summed it up well.
1227,We already have a base level of kids that might die in any given year.

1234,that just happen).
1235,&gt;his just further erodes confidence in the CDC and Fauci.
1236,he likely knows that things can change relatively quickly in parts of the country that are low vaccination.
1237,it also feels like a trap question he should have avoided tbh since the situation for christmas gatherings is different when every family member comes from various parts of the northeast versus if someone is travelling from california to atlanta or if the whole family gathers in florida or something.

1263,"I can be frustrated all day by their decision to not be vaccinated, neither is very old, both late 50's, neither were mean spirited people by any means, that's why it's frustrating they bought into idiotic propoganda, but outside of that they aren't bad people."
1264,"One is now dead, they other may never be the same."
1265,Some truth to this.
1266,I was already wary of people in general.
1267,"For a long time I thought it was a ""me"" problem for having trust issues."
1268,"This crisis strongly suggests that I was right all along, that a significant minority *are* untrustworthy, and I should continue to act accordingly to protect me and my circle."
1269,[removed]
1270,The 'close contact' notifications in my county are a total joke.
1271,You have to be within 3' of someone who 'did not regularly wear their mask' for more than 15 minutes in a single day and who tested positive within 3 days of their last attendance.
1272,"I'd be willing to bet they've let about 5 people know they're close contacts, despite obvious pockets of spread through numerous schools."
1273,"Ok, and…?"
1274,Do you want no precautions to avoid infections?
1275,Yeah you’re probably right
1276,I'd be okay with that.
1277,Thanks for the thoughtful answer
1278,5-11?
1279,You can take the food and eat in a courtyard away from other kids so you don't get COVID from them.
1280,There are ways to do it.
1281,When I was a teacher I'd have kids all the time ask if they could eat lunch with me in the classroom or eat in the hallway or go sit outside.
1282,Sometimes I'd go sit near them and read.
1283,It can be done and does not have to be a big deal.
1284,"If a vaccinated person is infected, they will quarantine because they're sick, like anyone else."
1285,If they don't then it means they're asymptomatic and it doesn't matter for them.
1286,The only problem is if they infect an unvaxxed person.
1287,So if everyone is vaccinated then more asymptomatic people rather than actually sick ones.
1288,The point is to stop hospitalization level sickness because otherwise it's just being sick like anything else.
1289,"And vaccination does stop spread, even if it's not 100%."
1290,The data is very obviously in favor of this statement.
1291,But the vaccine is not perfect.
1292,We're never getting back to that level.
1293,Covid is here to stay and we need to minimize the risk.
1294,"The new argument from anti-vaxxers is that the vaccines don't work as they are supposed to, so I thought I'd put out these real world numbers from the state of Georgia to show they have been doing exactly what was expected."
1295,"850,815 people have caught Covid since vaccines became available; 51,104 of those people were vaccinated, while 767,625 we're not."
1296,"That's 93.4% from the unvaccinated to 6.6% for the vaccinated, which is almost exactly what the trials showed for the various vaccines."
1297,And these trials were all before the Delta variant took hold.
1298,One last thing.
1299,"*Using the statistics from Georgia and extrapolating for the entire country, just under 300,000 people have avoided death by getting vaccinated."
1300,*
1301,"I mean - while I agree that zero is the goal, that's simply not realistic."
1302,"Busses, driving, riding bikes, walking to school are all not without risk."
1303,"And kids die from choking, or even the flu at school."
1304,What we need to focus on is appropriately minimizing the risk due specifically to Covid.
1305,Adults need to be vaccinated.
1306,Children who can should also be vaccinated.
1307,"We require them to get Chicken Pox, Hep B, Meningitis vaccines before being allowed to attend."
1308,Just add this to the list.
1309,"since the second shot is so much better, I hope they just make it into a 2 shot vaccine and call the booster a second shot."
1310,"Discussion  
   
We have investigated a nosocomial COVID-19 outbreak involving the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant among a highly vaccinated population."
1311,"The attack rate among exposed individuals reached 23.3% in patients and 10.3% in staff, with 96.2% vaccination rate among exposed individuals."
1312,"Moreover, several transmissions probably occurred between two individuals both wearing surgical masks, and in one instance using full PPE, including N-95 mask, face shield, gown and gloves."
1313,"In a recent publication by Bernal et al., the effectiveness of full vaccination with the Comirnaty vaccine against the Delta variant was high, although lower than against the Alpha variant (88% vs 93.7%) \[9\]."
1314,"This was not the experience in Israel, with a rapid increase in cases since June 2021 despite a high vaccination rate \[1\]."
1315,"Although reports of breakthrough infections are increasing \[10-12\], this communication emphasises several points."
1316,It challenges the assumption that high universal vaccination rates will lead to herd immunity and prevent COVID-19 outbreaks.
1317,"This was probably true for the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 virus, but in the outbreak described here, 96.2% of the exposed population was vaccinated."
1318,"Infection advanced rapidly (many cases became symptomatic within 2 days of exposure), and viral load was high."
1319,"Another accepted view is that, when facing a possible mismatch between the SARS-CoV-2 variant and vaccine or waning immunity, the combination of vaccine and face mask should provide the necessary protection."
1320,"Although some transmission between staff members could have occurred without masks, all transmissions between patients and staff occurred between masked and vaccinated individuals, as experienced in an outbreak from Finland \[12\]."
1321,"We cannot rule out that protection measures were not optimally implemented, however, transmissibility in summer 2021 differs from our experiences in the previous 18 months."
1322,Whether this can be attributed to the low Cq and high transmissibility of the Delta variant is not clear.
1323,"Of note, in our cases, in particular case patients, the time from vaccination was considerable."
1324,"The shortest interval was 142 days (5 months), and many of our case patients advanced to severe disease."
1325,"Data from Israel imply that the main reason for the increase in COVID-19 cases in summer is indeed waning immunity, and a third vaccine dose, 5 months after the second dose will possibly result in trend reversal \[13,14\]."
1326,"Conclusion

This nosocomial outbreak exemplifies the high transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant among twice vaccinated and masked individuals."
1327,"This suggests some waning of immunity, albeit still providing protection for individuals without comorbidities."
1328,"However, a third vaccine dose may be needed, particularly in individuals with risk factors for severe COVID-19."
1329,"Appropriate use of masks, especially in high-risk settings is advised."
1330,Lead by a living prophet: Joseph Mercola.
1331,"So, there is no way to stop this thing?"
1332,This post appears to be about vaccines.

1336,Yeah Murdoch has been spreading that propaganda with his papers/media
1337,We just decided we're not going to gather for the holidays with our families anymore.
1338,"It's nlot something we enjoy, so we're going camping instead."
1339,Miles from anyone &amp; that's probably just how it's going to be from here on out.
1340,"I mean you never needed to prove you took a flu shot to be allowed to visit restaurants, attend a show or take the plane."
1341,I’m hoping we’re not heading in a direction where you’ll have to comply to a yearly shot in order to live.
1342,It's clear that he's trying to hold out the carrot of gathering for the holidays to try and get people to slow the spread now.
1343,"It's manipulative, and transparent, and is exactly why people don't trust them at this point."
1344,[removed]
1345,"That sign in the article, ""Yesterday's heroes shouldn't be tomorrow's unemployed"", we've been doing that to Veterans for longer than my lifetime."
1346,"Totally unrelated to the point of the article, but it was the 1st thought that crossed my mind when I saw it."
1347,For God's sakes there should be some level of immunity a lot more than last year.
1348,Geez
1349,"Yep, this was always my biggest concern, and why I continue to be relatively safe and stick to eating outdoors as much as possible."
1350,I would hate to get a breakthrough case and lose my taste after all this time.
1351,I know one person who lost their taste for over 10 months at this point.
1352,I think losing my taste that long would send me into a terrible depression.
1353,This is why I roll my eyes when people talk about the survivability rate.
1354,Dying is literally the least of my concerns when it comes to this virus.
1355,"Cough 

North Korea probably did."
1356,But.....well moving there to escape probably has some cons.
1357,"The point is whether people are vaccinated or not doesn’t really matter, a fully vaccinated person carrying Delta Variant is almost no different than an unvaccinated person carrying it, and the efficacy of vaccines to prevent transmission while better than unvaccinated aren’t nearly good enough for such densely populated societies."
1358,"Reality is we’re all gonna get COVID at some point, the vaccines are good at keeping people out of the ICU outside of that they are not going to stop this pandemic"
1359,"All his classmates are going to have the ""wait, kids can die?"""
1360,talk
1361,"One thing that’s interesting is that even though RNA viruses do mutate at a high rate, coronaviruses are unusual in that their RNA copying has a proof-reading mechanism, which makes them more resistant to mutations than other RNA viruses."
1362,That lower mutation rate is one reason why we were caught off guard by all those variants emerging.
1363,If you let the virus roll the dice hundreds of millions of times...
1364,"This proof-reading mechanism is one reason why other antiviral drugs that work by inducing mutations, e.g."
1365,"Ribavirin, haven’t been very successful against Covid."
1366,The (very) good news is that Molnupiravir seems to work in a way that bypasses this proof-reading mechanism.
1367,More good news is that the drug doesn't seem very vulnerable to viruses developing resistance to it.
1368,"If you want a detailed description of how the drug works, there's a nice (very technical) article: [Molnupiravir: coding for catastrophe](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41594-021-00657-8), excerpts below:

&gt;Two recently published studies reveal the biochemical and structural bases of how molnupiravir disrupts the fidelity of SARS-CoV-2 genome replication and prevents viral propagation by fostering error accumulation in a process referred to as 'error catastrophe'."
1369,"&gt;  
&gt;...   
&gt;  
&gt;Treatment with molnupiravir failed to induce viral-resistance mutations, which suggests a high genetic barrier to immune evasion."
1370,"Notably, in contrast to the antiviral nucleoside analogs fluorouracil (5-FU) and ribavarin, molnupiravir is resistant to the proofreading exoribonuclease encoded by coronaviruses, which makes it an attractive target for further development."
1371,"Thus, understanding the molecular basis of inhibition of molnupiravir reveals the lethal mutagenesis mechanism that will aid the informed design of related inhibitor"
1372,My whole family is vaccinated and we wear masks so we’ll be getting together for thanksgiving and Christmas.
1373,"Exactly, at some point there is an acceptable level of risk I need to take to keep from losing more years of my (and my family members) finite life."
1374,I feel that flu vaccine being so popular is a very american  thing due to your insurance policies and lack of sick days.
1375,"Sure, its there and available in other countries but most adults don’t take them."
1376,"It’s recommended for kids and elderly but unless you’re getting sick a lot or are working with vulnerable  patients, most people just ignore flu shot."
1377,He’s probably talking mainly to the southern USA
1378,My family is having our Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays but we are making it clear that everyone has to be vaccinated or they aren't welcome.
1379,Which would only apply to some of our Trump-supporting relatives.
1380,So it might be an even more festive occasion if they choose not to do so.
1381,We still haven't decided if we are asking for vaccine cards at the door.
1382,/s
1383,"Sweet little baby, Rest In Peace."
1384,It’s just rich nations being greedy and trying to find a way to hoard the shots.
1385,Just got my booster.
1386,Covid doesn’t factor into the choices I make.
1387,That stopped when I got my first two rounds of vaccines.
1388,"You're both many times braver than the ""don't live in fear!!11!"""
1389,crowd.
1390,If they can keep Rt below 1 that’s a win.
1391,I’d rather have lived in New Zealand the past 1.5 years than anywhere else.
1392,I get that.
1393,It's not what I'm saying.
1394,I'm going to be vaccinated.
1395,I want to be vaccinated.
1396,"Unfortunately, you don't know my life and my struggles, so it's hard to pass judgement and why it's been challenging for me."
1397,"Oh nooooo, why do they make a new flu shot every year, talk about MoViNG tHe GoaLPosTs

 /s"
1398,Why the hell does it take them a month to even have the meeting.
1399,I swear every time these people get on TV they shoot themselves in the foot with misguided messaging.
1400,"Even in the most careful places, life has mostly returned to normal."
1401,"Here in Boston we have mask mandates, but compliance is CRAZY low and they're really only seen in high visibility areas like grocery stores."
1402,Step out of those places into social/recreation venues and they're no where to be found.
1403,"The idea that people would/should not gather over the holidays is a fantasy, and it would be great if the CDC would start being realistic about what they can expect from people at this point."
1404,"Push vaccines and vaccine mandates, push masks on planes and transportation if it makes you feel better, but understand that we've hit the limit on the social end to this pandemic."

1406,&gt;Had one Dr. want to give me Hydroxycloroqyine 🙄.
1407,I'm asking a little bit out of ignorance here but can you report that to the medical board?
1408,He should lose his license for trying to prescribe a drug for a use that it has not been approved for.
1409,"Most places don't seem to care, or at the most just ask if you qualify."
1410,My wife got her booster a few weeks ago and they asked if she was immunocompromised.
1411,When I got mine this weekend they didn't ask any questions and even thanked me for getting my booster.
1412,We are both in our 30s.
1413,I think a lot of it just comes down to the person working the counter.
1414,"This is purely anecdotal, but my wife was picking up a prescription at Target yesterday and an elderly woman asked to get her booster and the pharmacist told her she didn't need one even though the lady was clearly over 65."
1415,My wife said the pharmacist just seemed like they were in a bad mood because it was so busy.
1416,"So if you get an asshole working, they might give you a hard time, but I think if you make an appointment at a big chain at a slow time you should be fine."
1417,And if it doesn't work just schedule at another place until you get one.
1418,"For the others interested:     

&gt;	Nuclear pharmacy, also known as radiopharmacy, involves preparation of radioactive materials for patient administration that will be used to diagnose and treat specific diseases in nuclear medicine."
1419,It generally involves the practice of combining a radionuclide tracer with a pharmaceutical component that determines the biological localization in the patient.
1420,"[1][2] Radiopharmaceuticals are generally not designed to have a therapeutic effect themselves, but there is a risk to staff from radiation exposure and to patients from possible contamination in production."
1421,"[3] Due to these intersecting risks, nuclear pharmacy is a heavily regulated field."

1433,Get your kids the jab as soon as possible.
1434,There is effectively zero risk for the vaccine (none of them carry live virus) and any possible side effects (which are incredibly rare at any rate) are nothing compared to the potentially permanent touching you get with covid (including grey matter reduction in the prefrontal cortex...meaning it can actually make you dumber).
1435,Of focus has taught us anything it's that you just can't trust people to do the right thing.
1436,Take care of yourselves.
1437,This is so upsetting 😢
1438,I'm seething with rage at what all the people who refuse to get vaccinated or help limit the spread *might* do to my kid who's too young to be vaccinated... Can't imagine actually losing her.

1441,Oh man I’m sorry.
1442,"""lockdown 2 weeks and its over"""
1443,Well at this point anything beyond getting vaccinated is just more half measure advice that everyone is sick of.

1445,"Jesus christ, even people who followed the rules won't step out of life forever."
1446,Seems to me that there are a lot more anti-vaxxers in this subreddit since the beginning of last week.

1450,"Unfortunately still have to pay and with covid, you ignore it and you may still get infected."
1451,Did you stop to think maybe the delay is so the FDA can review the data BEFORE the meeting?
1452,"You know, like how things work in the real world?"
1453,"Maybe verify things, do some independent analysis?"
1454,I'd be willing to bet money they aren't just pushing it for no reason.
1455,"But, sure, hate on Fauci..."
1456,I was discussing the odds with my wife.
1457,There's risks to everything and government guidelines will say reducing a one in ten thousand chance to one in twenty thousand is worth it even if it's still low odds.
1458,Some parents will say the risk is worth it.
1459,Huge debate around co sleeping and the experts say the risk of SIDS is too high.
1460,Others will say we co slept our entire history as a species and are still here.
1461,But we also historically had high infant mortality rates.
1462,But there's other stuff that's stupidly high odds.
1463,"One in a hundred, no thank you."
1464,I think reopening schools says we are willing to let you die and there's a number we find acceptable.
1465,"Fuck your kids, we have an economy to keep running."
1466,That gave me pause as well.
1467,It's going to be years before scientists can look back over the larger course of the virus to figure out what factors caused the waves.
1468,"But in this particular quote I think he was referring specifically to social distancing, and how that factor doesn't seem right now to have had as much impact as originally thought."
1469,"Again, I think that will take some time to determine."
1470,And it seems unspoken in the article that our best human authority over the virus is the vaccine.
1471,This sounds incredibly dangerous.
1472,But if you are dying of covid in an icu it is probably worth it.
1473,"From the journal it doesn’t sound like viral evolution is a concern, but I could see some very negative unforeseen circumstances arise from intentionally mutating RNA in vivo: 

1."

2."
1475,"Viral evolution and resistance (not seen in initial studies)
3."
1476,Unintended interaction with host nucleic acid
1477,Increased cost?
1478,There are antivaxers convinced that the FDA didn't approve the Pifizer vaccine.
1479,It's highly effective (i.e.
1480,60-90%) at preventing hospitalization.
1481,"That's my wife's side of the family, no one is vaccinated, everyone gathers and they all think the vaccine is designed to alter their DNA - one of them cried when they heard the California vaccine mandate - oh my poor children but nevermind all the other kids who are hospitalized because they caught covid from an unvaxxed person."
1482,"Look, all I can say is that kids can eat lunch in a ventilated lunch room with air purifiers during a global pandemic, or sit 5 seats away from other kids, or eat outdoors or in empty classrooms."
1483,Saying you can't eat with a mask on is obvious.
1484,"Did you not notice the ""as soon as possible"" in my original statement?"
1485,When the science and studies have shown it presents little risk is when it'll be authorized for that age group.
1486,Or are you claiming that because we don't **currently** have the pediatric studies done means that **when they are approved** means we'll have an unknown level of risk that is completely detached from the known level of risk associated with billions of doses given to ages 12+?
1487,We don't get to inform our opinions based on that information at all?
1488,Is that your contention?
1489,"Hey antivaxxers, this is why we don't feel sorry for you when you die from the virus."
1490,It's almost like the virus comes in waves.
1491,"No seriously not picking on you, but this last wave has followed almost an identical path to previous waves."
1492,"Obviously places without vaccinatons and fewer restrictions were hit the hardest, but overall it always seems to take a wave form overall, regardless of what we do."
1493,Romania has one of the lowest vaccination rates in EU.
1494,"A huge swath of the population still seems to be distrustful of the government since the fall of Ceausescu and communism, and combined with the exodus of young people leaving for Western Europe, it creates a perfect environment for an older populace easily influenced by false information."
1495,Screeeee!
1496,It’s the war on Christmas!
1497,Grab yer guns we gots to defend Santa and Jesus!
1498,"It kinda frustrating how people can't seem to both dislike China, but also acknowledge that having dystopian levels of surveillance and authority also makes you pretty effective at controlling a virus."
1499,"China might be the only country that is able to make their zero COVID strategy work, for the same reasons we dislike them."
1500,That's insane!
1501,"That's got to be more than elsewhere, no?"
1502,Are they masking?
1503,Do teachers need to be vaccinated?
1504,So many questions!
1505,It doesn't matter what he literally said.
1506,It matters what comes across.
1507,It seems no one in charge of messaging during this thing understands that.
1508,What he literally said managed to piss of vaccinated people and surely won't help get people who are anti vax on board.
1509,&gt; Now they're going to have to do the booster dance every other country is facing.
1510,"They were always going to have to, the writing was on the wall about how unfeasible COVID zero is with Delta."
1511,"People want to excuse it, but NZ's slow procurement of vaccines even after Delta was known to be so infectious deserves to be criticized."
1512,It's not like NZ didn't have other examples to learn from too.
1513,"Look at Singapore - they had similarly low cases, a much higher vaccination rate and stricter measures in place (mask mandate, group size of 8 a few months back), yet they still couldn't keep Delta contained to their low double digit daily numbers."
1514,"Unless NZ intended to remain in lockdown for an extended period, this was the inevitable outcome."
1515,"You should definitely get treated for it if you get it, though."
1516,The people in this study were hospitalized and treated.
1517,Myocarditis can be very dangerous if untreated.
1518,No.
1519,There's a difference between eliminate (zero covid) and manage.
1520,Cases are dropping but not zero.
1521,You can still be infected if you're vaccinated.
1522,"And that's perfectly fine, because your risk of death/hospitalization is much much lower (although not zero)"
1523,As they should.
1524,"I would say they're a medium island, but otherwise spot on."

1680,Why are people still listening to this hack omfg
1681,"Yeah, flu vaccine mandates are common as fuck and have been for a long time."
1682,"Gee, maybe because they haven't been authorized for that age group yet except in studies."
1683,"The fact that there are crazies out there claiming all sorts of terrible and serious side effects that just do not line up with reality means that the likelihood of the FUD being associated with ""but but but this time with this age it's certainly a possibility it'll be super bad, way badder than getting the actual virus in the first place"" is ridiculous."
1684,The fact is that the vaccines have been astoundingly safe and effective at ALL age ranges currently authorized (including down to 12).
1685,So the overwhelmingly likely scenario is that the vaccine for the 5-11 year old age range will ALSO continue that trend of being overwhelmingly safe.
1686,Do you have any real reason to argue against the current safety of the vaccines as given to people 12+?
1687,"If so, please share, if not, why the FUD?"
1688,"I wonder if any of the people downstream from her, that she was a stepping stone used by COVID to reach, got really sick and injured, or died because of her?"

1690,"That being said, not everyone falls into that way of thinking, so it CAN be overcome, with the right amount of education and introduction to critical thinking at a young age."
1691,Trash article.
1692,"Doesn't take into account most recent research that has 1) [identified the closest known viral relative](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02596-2/) to Sars-CoV-2 in wild bats in Laos;


and  

2) [discovered *two* distinct Sars-CoV-2 genomic lineages](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02519-1), which, ""if verified, would mean that the scenario of a researcher accidentally being infected in a lab, and then spreading the virus to the population at large, would have had to happen twice""."

1712,Yes..but I heard an exec at cvs say they go by honor system if you need a booster or not
1713,I'd rather have had the stretches of COVID-free living they've had rather than the last year and a half dealing with COVID
1714,"I don't think ""swimming in cases"" necessarily follows, especially if they did something like vaccination + negative test to enter the country."

1718,"I don't know about that, a lot of policies and conspicuously absent policies in the US seem to suggest that some people are OK with a non-zero number of dead kids."
1719,Novavax is constantly delaying the launch of their vaccine even though they have had excellent phase III results from February 2021.
1720,(Hank Hill makes bwaaaaahhh face)
1721,This is tragic and infuriating.
1722,"It makes you feel so damn helpless, getting the shot to save others but still it wasn't enough here."
1723,Why would we specifically doubt competence from Novavax — did I miss something?
1724,Or did you mean a broad assumption of distrust rather than targeting them specifically?
1725,I don't know how likely it is that the virus would mutate towards less dangerous direction.
1726,So far it has done the opposite.
1727,The variant that left Wuhan was worse than the original Wuhan one.
1728,Then Alpha was worse again and now Delta is worse than Alpha.
1729,They not only infect easier but also cause more serious symptoms.
1730,Now the failed vaccination campaign puts the virus under a huge evolutionary pressure to circumvent immunity.
1731,We should not have mixed the vaccinated open society with huge infection numbers.
1732,It begs for a tragedy.
1733,In UK report the specialists say that there's even a realistic possibility that the virus will mutate towards MERS like lethality rates.
1734,It would mean 10-30% lethality rate.
1735,Do we really want to give it even a 1% chance of mutating that way?
1736,"Contraty to the popular disinfo that ""viruses never mutate more lethal"", there actually are famous cases of it like Ebola and West Nile."

1853,"When I said at the start of the pandemic ‘we need to live with the virus and 0 Covid is idiotic tactics’ people called me for wanting old people to die lol

Now people understand that money doesn’t grow on the trees and we cannot have a lockdown for 365 days like in North Korea"
1854,Absolutely.
1855,"There are also real negatives to keeping kids out of school, though."
1856,My wife teaches at a Title 1 school in second grade.
1857,Some of that kids can't write their names.
1858,Can't count past six.
1859,Almost none of them can read.
1860,Kids that didn't have help at home are massively behind in a way that they might never fully recover from.
1861,Upending their education make might have made sense pre-vaccines.
1862,"At this point, kids need to be back in school."
1863,"I am so happy I left Melbourne last year

Lockdown for so long, having a curfew and having police cars patrolling around looking for any people who broke the rules and fine them makes me think I travelled to North Korea lol"
1864,Constant reminders of how important looking out for others is.
1865,These people talking about their rights and 1 in a million garbage don’t comprehend that it may not be your child but it will be someone’s.
1866,It makes me fighting mad.

1870,*
1871,Cost-benefit analysis?
1872,Fuck costs.
1873,"If **one** child dies just b/c it wasn't ""cost effective"" to vaccinate him or her, then we're failing as a society and should be ashamed."
1874,"Healthcare is a human right, not some commodity to make millions for CEOs and shareholders."
1875,What kind of fucked up selfish hellhole has America become?
1876,"What sucks is that scientism is a legitimate concept useful for analyzing the ways that various entities try to make truth claims using science-y ideas, or the ways that technocratic solutions come about when another solution woulf work better... among other things."
1877,But you'd have to be into science or maybe educated or intellectually curious to get that.
1878,Vaccines work bro.
1879,"Vaccinated individuals are *much* less likely to transmit the disease to others, just like they're much less likely to contract it, and just like they're much less likely to require hospitalization."
1880,That includes children.
1881,"I had a third Moderna shot, as did some friends."
1882,"We had another few days of flu, but otherwise it was normal."
1883,"It isn't just cancer and birth defects you need to worry about, but also the possibility that this will hasten the ability for covid 19 to evolve faster in people taking Molnupiravir."
1884,"The survivors of the error catastrophe are probably going to be heavily mutated, which opens up a window for COVID-19 to develop a large escape mutation in one shot and make vaccines and antibody treatments much less effective."
1885,"A lot of people say that kids don’t get sick, including all of those protesting mandatory vaccinations at schools across the country."
1886,"I have no idea what point you’re trying to make here when OP is 100% right that children are still carriers, still at risk, and can still cause harm to those around them if they contract the virus."
1887,All you’re doing here is giving ammunition to anti-vaxxers.
1888,Except... Vaccinated individuals are still carriers.
1889,"They are less likely to have symptoms which can to some degree reduce transmission, however still carry a viral load and can still infect others."
1890,"There is no way in hell, unless my kid had underlying conditions putting them at higher risk, would I ever subject them to a new vaccine."
1891,"While I understand your frustration at having worked this whole time, it's important to keep in mind that there are multiple, valid reasons why some remained on unemployment benefits."
1892,"These include underlying health conditions, lack of sufficient child care, and America's crumbling mental health status."
1893,"The mental health situation in the U.S. wasn't great before the pandemic, but I think many people who were previously able to maintain to some degree lost that ability during lockdown isolation."
1894,"Some of them will need to transition to disability, either short or long term."
1895,"Granted, there are those who chose to stay home for more self-involved reasons, but the escalating rate of major depression/anxiety/suicidal ideation over the past year and a half demonstrates why some people might not be gung-ho to ""get of their lazy a$$es and work."""
1896,"Sorry, I just clicked suggested title and didn't know that Reddit substitutes words."
1897,I'll make sure words haven't been substituted words by copy and pasting from the original article next time.
1898,Getting a booster shot tomorrow because it's been recommended for me due to my profession.
1899,"Not looking forward to side effects again, but doing my part to protect myself, my family, and friends."
1900,"“Guys who cares it’s just one kid, kids die sometimes, that’s life.”

1903,I got Pfizer.
1904,Nothing but a sore arm and tiredness for me after the first dose.
1905,"After the second (which I got at noon), I was fine until evening then around midnight right before I went to bed I had chills for about 10 minutes."
1906,Then I went to sleep.
1907,"Woke up at like 5 am shivering, then I was between awake and asleep with chills till I woke up about 10 am."
1908,"Then laid in the bed trying to stay warm for an hour or so, then got up around 11, had some coffee, starting feeling better, and was able to start working by noon or so at my at-home job."
1909,Felt kinda run down the rest of the day.
1910,Was tired for a day or two after that.
1911,6-ish hours of slight discomfort was 100% worth the piece of mind of knowing my body now knows how to find Covid.
1912,"mRNA vaccines are amazingly cool, and are the culmination of 200 years of vaccine research."
1913,There isn't anywhere close to a 1% chance by many orders of magnitude.
1914,"If a child is infected, there's a 1 in 300,000 chance of death, about the same chance as being struck by lightning."
1915,Many people continue to [dramatically overestimate](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/09/covid-19-vaccine-status-age-discrimination.html) the risk to children.

1919,I didn't even know Ralph had a brother.
1920,Watch nz the last couple months was like watching the last safe stronghold during the zombie apocalypse get overrrun
1921,"&gt; They maye have some difference in timings, but it is by a few weeks

Depends what you mean by ""a few weeks"", the peaks of Ontario and Manitoba have been more than a month apart despite them being neighbours."
1922,"Interestingly enough, last winter also saw major differences: AB had a peak by early December, ON/QC by early January."
1923,&gt;while there is no such indication for AB.
1924,"Same goes for BC, which however has one of the highest vaccination % in Canada."
1925,It's almost like waves are primarily driven by geographical proximity.
1926,"But that doesn't change the fact that they're still carriers who can easily hurt those who are more susceptible to hospitalization; nor that it's still misinformation to say that they ""don't get sick,"" which tons of people are doing online."
1927,"End of the day, kids still need to be vaccinated to protect them and those around them."

1933,Wait has America gone back to banning gatherings?
1934,Blinked and I missed by the looks of it.
1935,"&gt; Breakthrough cases, however, are much more significant than people realize."
1936,That really depends on the definition of breakthrough.
1937,"The argument made by the people who follow the stated purpose of the vaccine, which is to prevent serious illness and death, will say that unless it causes serious illness and death then it's not a breakthrough."
1938,How can it be?
1939,Since mild illness doesn't breakthrough the point of the vaccine.
1940,This is the reasoning that some of the people on the FDA/CDC panels used.
1941,Since they think the term breakthrough is widely misused.
1942,Someone getting a mild or moderate case of covid is not a breakthrough.
1943,"By the letter of the point of the vaccine and thus the definition of breakthrough, they are right."
1944,I personally don't agree but I can't disagree with their reasoning.
1945,"I think we should be using the vaccines to prevent spread, not just hospitalization."
1946,"Ok. 
That does invalidate the scientific data on the national level."
1947,"Pfizer efficacy falls off faster, so who knows."
1948,I’m switching to moderna at booster time.
1949,"It may be too soon to tell if it's a good idea, but it's gonna happen anyway."
1950,"Don't assume stupid, most seem to be just mean."
1951,Their instinct is that life is cruel and that if they are cruel they get to rise above it.
1952,"""Why do bad things happen?"
1953,"If I make bad things happen, then I control it and can steer it away from me."""
1954,Families who are fully vaccinated are going to see each other.

1960,"Yes, the word “Christmas” is mentioned."
1961,Nobody said it wasn’t.
1962,"I said nobody said anything *against* it, or holiday travel, or seeing family."
1963,… Especially if we’re fully vaccinated.
1964,"From the link:

&gt; I believe just the way the CDC has recommended that when you are in a situation where you have a dynamic of virus in the community, where there's clearly a lot of spread, even if you are vaccinated and you are in an indoor setting, a congregate setting, it just makes sense to wear a mask and to avoid high risk situations."
1965,And what we should be doing is look at ventilation in indoor places.
1966,"We know now that this is clearly spread by aerosol, and when you have something spread by aerosol, you absolutely want more ventilation, which is the reason why outdoors is always much safer than indoors."
1967,"And if you are indoors, ventilation is going to be key."
1968,And that's the reason why we really should be paying attention to that.
1969,"&gt; MARGARET BRENNAN: But we can gather for Christmas, or it's just too soon to tell."
1970,"&gt; DR. FAUCI: You know, MARGARET, it's just too soon to tell."
1971,We've just got to concentrating on continuing to get those numbers down and not try to jump ahead by weeks or months and say what we're going to do at a particular time.
1972,Let's focus like a laser on continuing to get those- those cases down.
1973,"And we can do it by people getting vaccinated and also in the situation where boosters are appropriate to get people boosted because we know that they can help greatly in diminishing infection and diminishing advanced disease, the kinds of data that are now accumulating in real time."
1974,[removed]
1975,"In essence we do know how many ""units"" are needed for a given percentage of protection."
1976,"Antibodies are very highly protective against infection, but less meaningful after infection since it's your ability to scale up the immune system (humoral immunity) that matters."
1977,Scroll down to Figure 1 on that link.
1978,"Geometric decay of antibody titers means moving linearly leftward along the graph, which should result in at-first a very slow decline but then a faster and linear drop in protection."
1979,We also know that a third dose pushes antibody levels far to the right - making them higher against Delta than they initially were against wildtype.
1980,Shit.
1981,That's what I thought was the case.
1982,Damn.
1983,"If Delta takes hold, then y'all are utterly fucked given the relatively low levels of vaccination."
1984,Delta doesn't spare those who are unhealthy (it loves the fatties and the diabetics) or elderly.
1985,"You only have to look at the US experience in certain states - Florida, Idaho, Alaska, Texas, Alabama, etc."
1986,- to see what happens when there are insufficient beds.
1987,"Of course, the US is populated with morons who would rather take horse dewormer than a proven vaccine, and I trust folks in NZ will be scrambling to get vaxxed ASAP."
1988,"However, you've got a population which, due to the lack of Covid antibodies, is akin to un-managed tinder/undergrowth, in forest where the smallest of sparks has the potential to cause a massive conflagration."
1989,"Delta will rip through this population like a knife through butter and with no ICU beds available, thoughts and prayers are all the unvaxxed will have to cling onto."

2162,Fauci is a standard politician who has lied constantly.
2163,Get some other scientists to speak who are not politicians.
2164,It would most likely build more trust with the public in regards to science.
2165,"I'm pretty sure you would have led with that, and am therefore confident you have just made it up to try and ""win"" - nobody should take you seriously."
2166,Are your friends elder care home residents?
2167,Now you are just making things up.
2168,"A young vaccinated person dying would be likely to be in the news, it happens so rarely."
2169,"Really, your posts are just as bad as the anti vaxxers."
2170,The ones I know say they have a friend who died from the vax and all these people they know with vax side effects.
2171,Both are clearly bullshit people lie about to win internet arguments
2172,Happy you did!
2173,I'll get a booster shot of mRNA soon as well!

2184,Yikes!
2185,It's not a magic virus.
2186,It behaves like all the others.
2187,"VT here, it’s been true for us for over a month as well."
2188,Alaska or even North Dakota by November.
2189,It’s crazy how nobody seems to care
2190,The areas they access with a fake COVID vax card will have less Covid circulating than areas that are not restricting access.
2191,They are benefiting while everyone in the vaccine only area is significantly disadvantaged with their guard down.
2192,My milk supply dipped a couple ounces for a day.
2193,I had Moderna - but it was only for a day.
2194,It’s super hard to stop the milk supply.
2195,Women continue to produce milk for months or even years after weaning.
2196,[deleted]
2197,Antivax idiots are working hard to make sure it's unsafe
2198,Boston did annex a lot of its neighbors.
2199,"Boston annexed: Roxbury, Dorcester, Brighton, Charleston, and Hyde Park."
2200,"Hyde Park was the most recent, in 1912."
2201,"Boston failed to annex Brookline in the late 19th century, which seems to have been the turning point that slowed things down."
2202,He said it’s “too soon to tell.” People are indeed misinterpreting that to mean he said no.
2203,I think I might have the delta variant.
2204,"I started sneezing a bunch last night, thinking it’s allergies bc I have 2 cats."
2205,I was blowing my nose all through the night and could barely sleep.
2206,"This morning I woke up with a bad headache and still have been sneezing a bunch, and my forehead is warm so I might have a light fever."
2207,Also been feeling super drowsy.
2208,"No stomach ache or lack of appetite - I have a normal appetite, and taste and smell is normal."
2209,"I feel a little better than I did this morning, as coffee and allergy medicine helped with my headache but mostly feels like I have really bad allergies and low energy/slight fever."
2210,"I am vaccinated with Pfizer, but my boyfriend thinks I may have COVID."
2211,Is this likely?
2212,"Last year, many of us did not gather for the holidays."
2213,"I doubt it will be the same this year, though."
2214,I certainly plan to be with my family.
2215,[removed]
2216,This is correct.
2217,It wasn't a confusing question and his answer was direct.
2218,"Beyond that, most peoples issue (not speaking on republican politicians, didn't see what they said, assume it was ridiculous) was how hilariously out of touch that statement was with the average person and how they will behave."
2219,[deleted]
2220,Updated
2221,"If you look at table 1 the ""unexposed"" group had a higher incidence than the ""1 shot"" group which makes me question the power of the sample size."
2222,At the least we should subtract the unexposed rate from the 2nd shot group to get 5.8 - 2.2 = 3.6 per million one would think?
2223,Exactly this.
2224,"People think because they can do what they want, it's over and it doesn't affect them."
2225,Like the virus cares about your feelings.
2226,"It will take your life at will and when it wants, not on your fucking schedule."
2227,This is so insidious.
2228,"They won't get vaccinated, and now they are actively try to block people who want to get vaccinated."
2229,Who is scheduling the start snd stop date of the virus?
2230,"Fauci just said that you can go freely visit your family in christmas, and that his ""too son to tell"" comment was reffering about how the pandemic situation would be by that time (number of vaccinated, number of cases...), wich obvioulsy, since its a question trying to predict the future of how a complex situation will be in more than 2 months, its getting a ""too soon to tell"" response."
2231,https://archive.is/2PRAJ
2232,"40% is probably bs, virtually every other large scale study has indicated 70-95% for mRNA vaccines."
2233,"Also, don't forget, if you do catch it post vaccination its very likely to be mild."
2234,"Mask up, wash your hands, and live your life."
2235,"&gt; ""The best way to assure that we'll be in good shape as we get into the winter would be to get more and more people vaccinated,"" Fauci, the government's top infectious diseases expert, said Monday on CNN."

2239,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EpiVacCorona
2240,He's right.
2241,Some people haven't taken precautions to prevent things so I don't think they are going to stop now.
2242,It wasn’t misinterpreted.
2243,He said what he said.
2244,"If he had made the distinction of vaccinated family members or families in hot zones, that would be different but he made no distinction at all."
2245,"In November, he will be saying the same message."
2246,It was misinterpreted and now he's on damage control.
2247,There is zero friggin reason why family and friends can't get together for the Holidays.
2248,I have 3.
2249,All are in adulthood now and I am neither negative nor miserable.
2250,🤷‍♀️ They're pretty cool.
2251,Maybe it's just you.
2252,"That is an issue with lockdowns

Over time people stop following them"
2253,"Nothing stopped them last year, I don't know why anyone would think this year would be any different."
2254,"Can I still pointedly avoid my family at all costs, as usual?"
2255,It boggles the mind that they're afraid of the vaccine and not the virus.
2256,"It's been close to 20 years since my kids were in diapers, but you're making a good decision."
2257,"My younger 2 were in cloth diapers (and from what I can see, they've continued to improve since then)."
2258,"I agree with you though that it's not going to be a good option for people who don't have their own washer/dryer or whose schedules just can't handle multiple extra loads of laundry that have to go through multiple washes, even if they can afford the upfront cost."
2259,"It was definitely a time investment and had I been working, we probably would have gone with disposables."
2260,"FWIW, even after my kids were toilet trained, the prefold diapers they used still came in handy for almost everything, and some are still kicking around to this day."
2261,"Also, invest in Oxiclean; buy it by the truckload."
2262,It works amazingly well to get stains out.
2263,:D
2264,I’m not sure that’s reassuring 😐 😂 it does look like a small study though
2265,How would digital verification work for folks like my parents that don't have smartphones?
2266,Well this is just my experience but of the “had to get together because family is important” one of those people are dead (25 no preexisting conditions) and one can no longer breathe without an oxygen tank (38 no preexisting conditions).
2267,They all went into it saying “I know we shouldn’t but let’s all say what the hell and get together” and they all regret it now.
2268,"I’m not saying don’t get together with your family, but just be smart."
2269,Get vaccinated or get tested or just take what precautions you can
2270,It’s not the headlines that are misinterpreting things.
2271,Just go read the original post about this.
2272,A lot of the top comments are misinterpreting and complaining about what Fauci said
2273,"I assume it's a bit of wanting to make sure that their people only wanted the Russian one, a bit of people in other countries only wanting the Russian one (and buying it from them), and a bit of just reflexive anti-Western sentiment."
2274,"People can criticize the “messaging”, but at this point, there cannot be a universal message."
2275,"People are in too many unique situations to have simple guidelines:

Everyone is fully vaccinated."
2276,"Everyone is fully vaccinated, but some are high-risk."
2277,Adults vaccinated with unvaccinated children.
2278,Adults vaccinated with unvaccinated high-risk children.
2279,Some adults vaccinated and some adults unvaccinated.
2280,Some adults vaccinated and some adults unvaccinated with unvaccinated children.
2281,High-risk vaccinated adults and unvaccinated adults and/or kids.
2282,"He got COVID in the summer, months after a vaccine was available to him."
2283,“Just like the flu.”/s
2284,"I had this exact conversation with someone who said they were waiting then once it got fully approved they said “It’s not actually approved, they just extended the EUA, people really need to do their own research.”  Then this person went on to get Covid shortly after."
2285,Isn't it actually more than Wyoming?
2286,It's probably closer to 120% of the population of Wyoming if I had to guess.
2287,"Yes, I'm from Melbourne."
2288,"I was more pointing out the strategy was working, only takes one state going rogue to basically ruin it for everyone."
2289,In this case NSW who had a travel bubble with NZ and that's how it got introduced there.
2290,"Because Melbourne and Sydney are effectively now cut off from the rest of the country, the rest of the country can live relatively normal lives for now as they get their vaccination rates up."
2291,"&gt;A lot of countries that managed the pandemic were late for the vaccine

A lot of countries didn't have Pfizer begging them to sign a deal for than enough doses for the entire country and to be one of the first to receive it."
2292,Our government was more interested in lining ex-colleague and donor pockets than what was best for the country.
2293,Our PM has resorted to raiding supplies from stockpiles meant for more needing countries in order to shore up our supply because he is worried about getting reelected at the upcoming election.
2294,"&gt; Acute Myocarditis incidence is 5.8 cases per 1,000,000 people."
2295,Per million of which people?
2296,A similar study had I think over 250 in a million for males aged around 25 with Moderna.
2297,That's 1 in 4000.
2298,"Not really ""insanely low"" any more."
2299,If you read the article instead of just headlines you would know why it is a misinterpretation.
2300,"Fauci sais that if you are vaccinated you can go visit family, no problems at all."
2301,"His ""its too soon to tell"" comment was him reffering to how the pandemic situation would be at christmas, not about if people would be able to see their families or not."
2302,"He encourages people to go see them, whatever the pandemic situation is, as long as you are vaccinated, and if you arent, he recommends you take it (obviously)."
2303,"Because of Fauci initially saying ""it was too early to tell"" whether Americans should avoid gathering during the holidays (which he walked back quickly by saying he was celebrating holidays with family and Americans should too) and the CDC publishing guidelines for the holidays that included recommending ""virtual celebrations"" (which magically the link that included that guideline got removed quickly after I am sure reports of blowback against it got to the CDC)."
2304,We’re getting there
2305,People are still fighting over masks.
2306,I think the time of subtlety left us a while back.
2307,"Actually, same, but everyone is fine now."
2308,So seeing family is worth it.
2309,"I also know people who got covid at work, but they still go to work lol."
2310,"Oh the virus definitely changed her heart, it has known cardiovascular effects."
2311,But it won't cure stupid.
2312,"It’s confirmed that antibodies are in breast milk, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it lends a significant amount of protection."
2313,You’re right that RSV is worse.
2314,"Fyi, I have a newborn and I’m WAY more worried about RSV."
2315,Doesn’t mean I’m not vaccinated for COVID and wear a mask.
2316,It’s just what the data shows.
2317,How much time did you have between second shot and desease?
2318,It's after Christmas we have to worry about.
2319,I haven't heard about that one.
2320,The Rasputin vaccine?
2321,"It is stunningly amazing to look at the audacity and arrogance of the US that we think, in our puny little, over indulged, brain of ours, that we can schedule the start and stop date of a virus."
2322,I have an 18 month old and a baby due in November.
2323,Everyone is required to be vaccinated and im debating on asking for tests.
2324,[removed]
2325,Is it possible to learn this power?
2326,"Anyone else feel that realistically speaking, the ceiling of the US for vaccinations is just around 70% of the population being fully vaxxed?"
2327,I really can’t see it getting higher than that.
2328,"&gt;-Virtual Thanksgiving and Christmas again

&gt;-Drop off food and gifts at a safe distance

&gt;-Drive around and wave at your neighbors

LOL."
2329,How tone deaf can they be to put out those guidelines and expect people fully vaccinated to follow them.
2330,Just LOL.
2331,"from the article::


&gt;	At issue is a comment Fauci made Sunday on CBS's ""Face the Nation."""
2332,"Asked by host Margaret Brennan if ""we can gather for Christmas, or it's just too soon to tell,"" Fauci replied, ""You know, Margaret, it's just too soon to tell."""
2333,Shockingly you can be a decent human and make money.
2334,Because it takes time for FDA to review the data on several thousand trial subjects.
2335,Then FDA does it’s own statistical analysis.
2336,Pfizer hasn’t even submitted everything yet- they said they started the submission.
2337,"Makes me feel even stronger that if you are well off enough, go to cloth diapers."
2338,"Save the environment, and save the supply for those who need it more"
2339,I didn't say anything about blanket restrictions.
2340,[removed]
2341,[removed]
2342,Just tell them that for their safety you won't go because even though you're vaccinated you can get infected and infect them and not even realize it.

2477,"The purpose of a booster is to counter waning immunity, which is really unlikely in young people."
2478,"A third dose is likely going to be good to get long-lasting immunity, but you wouldn't want it until 6 or possibly 9 months after the second dose."

What needs to be considered instead is the unrealized risk."
2487,"Is the risk of ""long term side effects"" greater or is the risk of COVID greater."
2488,Most doctors and public health officials will tell you COVID risk is greater and have taken the vaccine.
2489,I have a friend who is a doctor and he said that because our society is ‘opened up’ people will be *really* celebrating the holidays together to make up for last year.

2513,My guess has been that a lot of them will embrace it.
2514,"I know they all have their different reasons for why they are adamant about not getting vaccinated, but I’ve suspected for a while that much of it is being stubborn and afraid of being wrong."
2515,"If they embrace it first, no one actually forced it on them like people tried to do with those vaccines."
2516,Sounds like a win.
2517,"/s

Whatever."
2518,I don’t care.
2519,Just stay out of the hospitals.
2520,"An anti-vaxxer family member of mine sent me a stupid anti-vax image with the term ""scientism""."

2524,Does anyone know about booster shots for 12-17 year olds?
2525,"I got the second dose in June, so do you think a booster will be available for 12-17 year olds by or in December?"

2527,"Honestly, 20 minutes of agony sounds better than months or years of agony."
2528,"Death comes for us all, and it sucks every time."
2529,The best thing you can do for your mental health is to make your peace with that fact.
2530,I had a previous anaphylactic episode to an injectable and was scared to death of getting the vaccine.
2531,I actually started seeing a therapist to get me past the fear and got it done.

2536,I upvoted for Covid awareness.
2537,"The time period of the change observed was ""January 6 to March 29 of 2021"" though."
2538,"Which was pretty early, and honestly a time when many people would have been initially hesitant because the vaccines were still new and only in some tens or hundreds of thousands at the time, with relatively short time windows for most of them."
2539,"So yeah, if there's a new vaccine people might need to see it deployed a bunch before jumping on, makes sense."
2540,"Back in Sep 2020 or so, I was planning to wait a while after the vaccines were widely available before getting them, just in case some issues arose only after seeing it in more people/time."
2541,"And by Jan 2021, I was busy trying to figure out, how far I could stretch the criteria for being eligible for the vaccine in order to get it early."
2542,I'm horrendously needle-phobic.

2556,Your nurse friend is wrong.
2557,Anecdotes are not data.
2558,As a population becomes mosyly vaccinated then of course a higher fraction of the cases will be in vaccinated people.
2559,The vaccine reduces your chance of death by around 90%.
2560,"If you are old, overweight, hypertensive, diabetic etc then your chances of death from Covid are high."
2561,Maybe as high as 90% if you have a combination of these .
2562,If you get vaccinated then you still have a 10% chance of dying.
2563,"The reason rates are increasing as the vaccination rates go up is that the rate of transmission of the Delta variant is very high, and it's outpacing the vaccination rate."
2564,True herd immunity will not occur until at least 90% of the population is vaccinated.
2565,"70% of people will get over Covid with no I'll effects, just like a couple of weeks of bad flu."
2566,The other 30%...not so good.

2582,Reply with “MRNA vaccines have no long term safety data”
2583,This where I would persuade the players to get their jab and explain that benefits such as what you described.

2604,I feel like this is just talking about a difference between stated and expressed preferences.
2605,It's one thing to talk about what you're planning to do.
2606,It's another to risk your job defying a vaccine requirement
2607,My perspective: health is what you put into it.
2608,"It is a compendium of many different aspects, weight, exercise and diet are three important aspects."
2609,"Part of the issue (regardless of the quality of the research) is how much are you willing to do to fight back, take good care of yourself, and look to the long term view."

2624,I'd not be so sure that noone in NZ believed that.
2625,"I have family members and friends back home that definitely thought that, and I'd had arguments with people on here about the inevitability of covid who seemed pretty sure it was possible to maintain ""covid zero""."
2626,That said though I agree with your points and I think that was the plan.
2627,I just wish the NZ government had been transparent about it.
2628,"It also annoyed me when Ardern stoked fear rhetoric and got high and mighty about other places - if I recall correctly she called our reopening here in the UK ""reckless"" and claimed it would endanger the whole planet."
2629,Something about how NZ wouldn't accept any deaths etc.
2630,"If this pivot to a more realistic post-vaccination long term strategy was the plan all along, then she was kind of talking bollocks at that previous point."
2631,Not strong enough to lose his salary.
2632,I'm not sure I agree.
2633,Facebook wasn't the first social media platform of its kind.
2634,It's not even the only major social media platform of its kind today: both China and Russia have competing platforms that I know of.
2635,I wouldn't be surprised to learn of others.
2636,Facebook's predecessor's didn't have the problems Facebook has.
2637,"I don't know of any information indicating that any contemporary competitors have anywhere near the scale of issues that Facebook has either, but I'm very open to being educated there."
2638,"Even different kinds of social media platforms, like Reddit, Youtube, or Twitter, do not face anywhere near the scale of problems that Facebook has."
2639,That's even though they do share in the base problems: they all just address those problems far better and base their business model in part around preventing those problems from festering.
2640,Facebook does the opposite and has built their business around causing and expanding those problems.
2641,"Considering FB's unique position in the realm of ""shittiest social media platform"" both historically and today, I'm not at all convinced we'd be in the same place had a different platform rising to take its place had it never existed."
2642,"&gt; The thread above OP was a scare comment about how open schools will lead to a wave of new infections, a wave which hasn’t materialize and in all likelihood will not

You obviously didn’t keep up with what happened when Texas opened up their schools."
2643,"The fact is there are places that don’t (and by government order cannot) require masks, actively fight vaccine mandates, and spread misinformation like wildfire."
2644,Texas was and still somewhat is a shit storm for Delta variant.
2645,And that’s the problem.
2646,We sound like we’re fear mongering only because literally some parts of the world won’t take basic precautions.
2647,And when zero precautions are taken that’s when a virus will spread.
2648,"In places that are masking and cleaning, they’re fine to attend school most likely."
2649,Studies support that.
2650,"UNICEF, CDC, and many others say that’s fine."
2651,When you follow proper safety guidelines the risk for transmission and exposure is minimal.
2652,"The fact is though, almost nowhere is following the guidelines perfectly."
2653,So that begs the question: what is the threshold for these imperfect guidelines?
2654,What is minimum viability for safety?
2655,That’s what isn’t being studied or at least that’s what isn’t popular knowledge if it is being studied.
2656,And that’s where the danger comes in when trying to fight this virus and that’s where statements like yours are *very* dangerous.
2657,People will read your statements with *their* situation in mind and become lackadaisical about *their* situation’s safety guidelines.
2658,"So if their situation was enforcing masks at a 95% success rates, they may see a 90% success rate as acceptable now, but contrast that with the district that never or can’t mask and simply washed hands every time they entered the classroom, now maybe they start washing hands every other time?"
2659,Or not at all now because it’s “rare” and washing hands takes too much time.
2660,"While these admittedly are very poor examples, I do hope they help illustrate the dangers in telling people “hey, this is a very rare thing.” Because there’s three things at play here: 1) humans are nutritiously bad at understanding small probabilities, 2) you only have to catch COVID once for it to really mess you up and/or kill you, 3) hospital beds and medical personnel are being taken up by adults and teens that refuse to get vaccinated."
2661,"Unfortunately moderating is a near impossible task, even if they were interested in attempting it."
2662,Facebook exists to trap people and manipulate them for-hire.
2663,This is the logical endpoint of that business model.
2664,I cannot imagine being a parent during this shit.

2666,Agree.
2667,"When I went to college and started learning about really thinking critically, it was a game changer."
2668,My world history professor taught the class by having us read important literature written at those times.
2669,We stated with The Epic of Gilgamesh.
2670,We got to the time of Jesus and I remember one of our essay options was describing how the Christian Jesus was a cult leader of that time… I was raised Catholic and I ate loved his class so much.
2671,I’m not religious anymore.
2672,All it takes is one little question to really open up your mind.
2673,I'm not one of those who doesn't take Covid seriously but flu absolutely does cause long term effects.
2674,"Seemingly similar to the ones seen in long Covid, although total loss of taste and smell seems a lot less common."
2675,[deleted]
2676,Inevitable since Delta is much more transmissible.
2677,Plus with vaccines eventually you do have to look at learning to live with the virus.
2678,I mean short term it was a great policy and helped them avoid several more lockdowns last year but long-term elimination just isn't possible.
2679,Good point.
2680,This breaks my heart and soul… I can’t do this anymore
2681,[removed]
2682,"Even though there's a yearly flu vaccine, I can't wait to hear the anti-vaxxers claim a victory over the COVID vaccine."
2683,Elimination really isn't a possible solution long term unless you keep the border closed forever.
2684,Eventually once you open up the borders again covid will enter the country again since the only way to keep covid out forever is to eliminate it worldwide which obviously isn't going to happen.
2685,Plus with Delta lockdowns don't really work as well anymore.
2686,Although aslong as vaccine takeup is high due when they do open their borders deaths should remain low
2687,"Exactly the same here in Ireland, we had a huge surge around Christmas-February with the highest cases per capita in the world."
2688,From the outside looking in it probably seemed like a disaster zone yet for the vast majority of people it just meant a lot of sitting at home.
2689,I personally don't know a single person who even ended up in hospital here and haven't heard anyone I know mention that they've lost anyone.
2690,Not trying to play down the obvious seriousness of covid but the media sensationalism makes it seem like a zombie apocalypse at times

2695,"This ""viruses never mutate more lethal"" was so popular idea in March 2020."
2696,"Too many ""experts"" were absolutely confident about that."
2697,I think this has to do with some psychological factors like not accepting the reality if it is too painful and in Internet crowd in general where every one has an opinion but nobody is held responsible for spreading the nonsense.
2698,To what end?
2699,This all operates on an idea that COVID can be exterminated.
2700,It cannot.
2701,So they're being careful for what?
2702,Once you've consigned yourself to the idea that you will get COVID then why bother avoiding it by locking yourself away?
2703,You’re smart and or a good planner.
2704,When I heard the NBA was locking if down I knew it was about to get a little serious….
2705,"I just went to grocery, bought some canned goods, sanitizer, soap, and a pack of tp… hoped for the best and left some for those who have it worse"
2706,I'm not convinced that's a reason to assume incompetence specifically.
2707,It very well could be the result of it.
2708,But the biomed industry will have spent the past ~year focusing on producing the first vaccines to be approved.
2709,"Might be that as a smaller company they just cannot get the manufacturing commitment, even while doing things right."
2710,Could be unknown legal hurdles.
2711,Could be things I haven't thought of.
2712,"And yes, it could be that they're just dropping the ball."
2713,But I don't see why we should assume that and evaluate them as such.

2754,What about living wages
2755,This wasn't actually where the government screwed up.
2756,Level 4 was dropped due to non-compliance; there were too many people breaking lockdown to make it worth the economic pain.
2757,Severe lockdowns only work if the populace is compliant (unless you go the China route and simply weld everyone into their houses).
2758,"So the government was stuck between a rock and hard place; end the strict lockdown and let Delta spread, or keep the lockdown and let it spread anyway while punishing people following the rules and continuing to blow a hole in the economy."
2759,"(I personally think they should have kept it in place, but I understand why they didn't.)"
2760,"No, the real screw-up is that they had an 18 month head start on preparing our medical system and health infrastructure for what they knew was eventually coming, and they did fuck-all because they were too busy taking victory laps and patting themselves on the back for keeping New Zealand ""Covid free""."

2794,"Because, generally, it’s more of a sure thing, when you have one regulatory body accept and approve it, then submitting to new regulatory body."
2795,Nobody wants to be the first one to say yes.
2796,Oh man.
2797,COVID is trying to speed run to unlock Extreme Bioaerosol.
2798,That's an OP tactic.
2799,[removed]
2800,About the Influenza cases - there's actually some valid worries there.
2801,"First, Influenza cases where indeed almost non-existent last winter in comparison to other winters."
2802,But that also means 'the flu' has some catching up to do the coming winter (that's right around the corner on the northern hemisphere of course) so flu cases may skyrocket and again overwhelm healthcare providers on all levels.
2803,Complicating factor is that what goes in to the 'flu shot' is partly selected based on which flu variants where the most dominant... last winter... you see the problem there - the flu shot may not be as effective this year as it was in other years.
2804,Nobody cheers on more deaths of course.
2805,"But we could see even more flu deaths averaged over the two winters, last and coming, because of this basically *postponed* flu wave."
2806,"Of course the actual numbers can only be known in hindsight, but we'll have to wait a few years before we can come up with a decent approximation of the final death toll of the pandemic and its consequences."
2807,It’s one thing for those who decided to still get pregnant while knowing what was happening but for those of us who had a baby shortly before covid hit not knowing what was to come- it’s been really rough.
2808,Must have been difficult flying so many secondary-age children to England for infection.
2809,"I hate this idea that people who haven't been ""working"" somehow chose that?"
2810,Every person I know who's been out of work &amp; on unemployment got there by no fault of their own.
2811,Their jobs either let them go due to COVID or closed completely-- nothing to return to.
2812,"On top of that, many when given the opportunity to stay home and be safe vs potentially putting yourself/loved ones at risk chose to stay home and be safe."
2813,That's not an unreasonable choice during a global pandemic.
2814,"Many also used the opportunity to evaluate their life, what they were doing vs what they want to do, learn new skills, etc..."
2815,"But it's easier to make assumptions &amp; classify every single one of these people as ""lazy"" I suppose."
2816,Hearing stuff like this really makes me grateful that my mom decided to retire early from teaching.
2817,The districts here are the same; No testing unless they’re showing symptoms.
2818,"Masks recommended, but not enforced at all."
2819,"The school board meetings were insane with the borderline-blood-lust some people had about requiring masks, so the districts decided to not require them."
2820,"However, it is not a new thing."
2821,"It has been happening with many viral diseases for decades now, even the flu."
2822,"For example, in a recent study they found that after some weeks (can't remember how many) 42% of covid positive people reported at least a lingering symptom and that number was 30% for flu positive people."
2823,I hope that it gets the attention it deserves now that the percentage is higher and it affects more people than it used to.
2824,"Solid reminder why everyone who can get vaccinated, should."
2825,Protect those who can't for actually legit reasons.
2826,"Yeah, I guess."
2827,"But if Biontech of Pfizer don't submit data for a market authorization, nothing will move forward with the EMA, right?"
2828,"I am not totally sure how it works, but I am under the impression that the manufacturer has to approach the EMA."
2829,[removed]
2830,They’ll use the same data after CDC/FDA approves the vaccine like adult’s vaccine.
2831,"I teach kids grades 2-12, and they are so used to and unaffected by wearing masks it borders on the miraculous."
2832,Kids are great.
2833,"So, Pfizer went to get authorization to treat kids younger than 12y in the USA and Canada."
2834,Do we know anything about the EU?
2835,"While I truly hope NZ avoids the worst, I do think it is likely they are going to have an ugly few months as Delta rips through the population."
2836,"They can minimize the damage with vaccines, but even high levels of vaccination do not seem to be enough to prevent a Delta rampage."
2837,"To be fair the deep cleaning is kind of the COVID version of ""Security theater"" since it transfers mostly through airborne droplets and is only a risk if you touch a surface someone directly coughed or sneezed on and then touch your face without sanitizing."
2838,"Good air flow (and masks) is way more important, but it's way easier to wipe down some surfaces to make everyone feel better than it is to update your HVAC."
2839,Source: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/science-and-research/surface-transmission.html
2840,Do you consider death a long term health effect?
2841,That's disappointing to hear.
2842,NZ was the beacon that got things done when every other country failed.
2843,The article credits a returning traveler from Australia for a spike in transmission - why did NZ accept returning travelers?
2844,"They were previously articles about their procedures being so strict that returning travelers couldn't return home, and while callous, seemed to be working."
2845,Now they're going to have to do the booster dance every other country is facing.
2846,LoOk At ThE nUmBeRs give me the source or gtfo of here

2849,"If you only had Facebook to go by, you'd think 90% of people are antivaxxers."
2850,In reality it's like 5%.
2851,I just don't know why Facebook is this beacon for them?
2852,[removed]
2853,I am of the belief that a third shot around 6 months out should be considered a part of the normal vaccination schedule for Pfizer.
2854,"It seems many vaccinations have a booster 6-12 months after initial vaccination, and in principle makes perfect sense to retain a longer term immune memory."
2855,Correct
2856,All those healthcare workers who are choosing not to get vaccinated will have plenty of options.
2857,"The world is worst off without the smile of this little dude, this is so upsetting."
2858,[removed]
2859," ok, so now someone needs a degree?"
2860,shouldnt be a shocker nobody is working then.
2861,im no longer working and attending school myself.
2862,love to see these shit businesses burn.
2863,That last one is underappreciated.
2864,"The first version of a thing that you learn is the one that usually sticks, and *The Apprentice* was the first version of Trump that much of America saw."
2865,"Hah, yeah."
2866,Been for months.
2867,"To be fair, october really was the date thrown around by a lot of articles back then :P"

2869,"I am a wedding photographer in New Jersey, I’ve shot around 30 weddings since early may."
2870,Masks have been gone at 95 percent of weddings since may.
2871,"I am attending an indoor event in New York City this week that I purchased tickets for that is fully vaccinated only, I just found out the whole event is requiring masks at all times."
2872,"A little bummed, If this was disclosed I would have considered not attending."
2873,Fully vaccinated only + masks at all times seems a bit excessive no?
2874,[removed]
2875,I don’t have half a mil to go to a hospital
2876,"As a society we will need to adapt in different ways, just as we have with cars."
2877,"Seatbelts and airbags have become required items, as vaccines should be."
2878,"We have lots of laws regarding the use of roads, to try to protect lives."
2879,"I would expect a societal shift towards safety, for example wearing masks in public indoor spaces, prioritizing ventilation and air circulation in buildings, and a significant shift to working from home in all sectors (which, coincidentally, will also reduce road deaths significantly; we should have done that a long time ago)."
2880,Not wanting to take a vaccine = thinking you're above medical professionals.
2881,Learn something new everyday hehe
2882,It's like banning driving just to make sure no one dies from a car crash.
2883,You always have to weigh things.
2884,"Even when this thing becomes endemic, individually you could still stay home all the time, order things online, etc etc."
2885,Do you think it would be worth it tho?
2886,"No, I didn't but that's a good idea."

2890,"&gt; “This year [a different vaccine] is completely unneeded, but by mid-next year, it could be a different situation,” he said."
2891,"“This is a continuous evolution, and that evolution has just started.”

His actual statement seems a lot less definitive than the headline implies."
2892,He merely suggested it might be necessary.
2893,The headline makes it sound inevitable.

2896,[removed]
2897,Yeah it would have required a coordinated global effort at a level that I simply don't have faith we're currently capable of.
2898,I think once it had failed to be contained in China the ensuing outcomes were inevitable.
2899,Initial containment would have been the best hope for eradication.
2900,[removed]
2901,Any anti-vaxxer who refuses the vaccine based on it being experimental who has no problem taking this pill should face some sort of negative consequence.
2902,Like the pill can only be injected.

2910,"I got every single one that I was allowed to get, even if they were optional."
2911,I thought it was like magic; here's this medicine that I don't even have to taste and it keeps me from getting sick.
2912,I almost have to wonder if they think they're playing the long game.
2913,"As in get let go, file some kind of grievance or sign up for a class action lawsuit, and eventually get their job back with back pay."
2914,"700,000+ dead, suck it up buttercup and get the fucking shot."
2915,It's our way out.
2916,Thank you.
2917,She lived a long life.
2918,I can't imagine losing a six-year old.
2919,I'm so happy for you!
2920,It was a toss up between the 5-11 approval or my daughter's 12 birthday.
2921,She's very proud to show people her card that says she got it on her birthday.
2922,"I counted down the days, just as I am until her second shot, and then until October 21, her Free Day when she'll be two weeks post second shot."
2923,I guess the over [500 others](https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Provisional-COVID-19-Deaths-Focus-on-Ages-0-18-Yea/nr4s-juj3) happened last year
2924,His research turned up about 15 Million reasons why.
2925,I'm so sorry little one.
2926,We all failed you.
2927,"When I got covid my sense of smell was suppressed, and that wasn't the problem, 1 month after recovering, I literally got parosmia."
2928,I literally don't feel like eating anymore.
2929,At this rate I'll probably just prefer starving over this.
2930,"My gut feeling is that for purely logistical/sociological reasons, that any scenario where continual boosters are needed will trend towards an annual booster."
2931,Ideally combine it with the flu shot.
2932,Alternatively if we're lucky the time frame will be much longer and can be done every e.g.
2933,5-10 years.
2934,I took my daughter in to get our flu shots on Friday.
2935,The pharmacy was running behind and we ended up waiting for an hour.
2936,It was back-to-back customers at the registers the entire time and almost everyone was there for their booster.
2937,I was thrilled to see it.
2938,I really wonder how much of this whole thing is just children of all ages being afraid of shots
2939,I think it is too late for them now.
2940,There's dozens of cases popping up there now with no clue of how they could have got it.
2941,"This means it has likely spreading in several branches of younger, healthier populations for weeks below the radar."
2942,I just think they didn't take airborne precautions seriously enough to stop the spread fro.
2943,MIQ
2944,"Did that mistake by waiting for a 'better' vaccine and preferably a single shot, my taste and smell have depreciated considerably post recovering, hate to taste all my beloved foods/drinks now."
2945,That is the worst part of the disease
2946,Hospitals being overwhelmed is a bigger issue than mental health.
2947,I am glad that she got it.
2948,"My daughter is eight, so it will be soon."
2949,But it makes me less likely to get covid.
2950,[removed]
2951,I am so sorry.
2952,"I think they will be fine health/death wise, but psychologically is what I mean"
2953,"My mother passed from it just before the vaccine, and it made it so much harder to bear."
2954,I cannot imagine how anguished this family feels.
2955,The covid ride has just begun for Australia.
2956,My daughter is 12 (just!
2957,She's counting down to her second shot on Thursday) and this comes up a lot in her classes.
2958,Most kids are 11.
2959,And most of them don't want the shot.
2960,"I hope that has to do with childish opinions on shots, and not actually what will happen."
2961,"But I live in the south, so who knows."
2962,The Jordan Klepper video last week was in the next county over from me.
2963,"Granted, I live in a city, so it's more liberal by nature, but it's still got a LOT of hicks in it."
2964,It's in the south.
2965,"We were also higher in case rate a couple weeks ago, so this article is a bit late."
2966,Cases are already falling
2967,Ill remember you little man!
2968,Rest in peace.
2969,If anyone has a gofundme ill kick a few hundred dollars down that way.
2970,Same with MA.
2971,Though a friend in my local hospital says it's been miserable there.
2972,"Most they are seeing are unvaccinated, however, but they aren't the nicest to deal with apparently"
2973,Are...are...people just afraid of needles?
2974,"Thanks yes, all those questions form the backdrop to the most critical one (as posted) - basically, I had no interest in taking those cumulative risks if the vaccine did **not** provide some resistance to acquiring or spreading."
2975,"Not everyone gets that, tho."
2976,I know of one truly asymptomatic case.
2977,"She technically was tired for a couple of days, but never would have known if she hadn't tested positive prior to that."
2978,"Her boyfriend ran the gauntlet of symptoms tho, unfortunately, but luckily recovered his sense of smell quick."

2980,"Gonna copy + paste my comment from further down in the thread because saying this drug “causes cancer” is misleading

&gt; The thing about molnupiravir is that you only need to take the drug for a couple days."
2981,"In our daily lives, we are exposed to plenty of chemicals with mutagenic/carcinogenic potential."
2982,"Hell, UV rays from the sun can cause DNA mutations."
2983,CT scans (which are given to basically every damn person that shows up to an ER in the US) can cause mutations.
2984,"&gt;Full-blown, metastatic cancer requires a lot of mutations (typically occurring/induced over a long period) to occur."
2985,"But we’re talking about taking one drug for a couple days, so the potential for mutagenesis is pretty damn negligible unless we’re talking in the context of pregnancy."
2986,Of course.
2987,"For starters, supply will be limited and you may not be guaranteed the treatment even if really ill."
2988,"In comparison, only 4.8 million people have died from Covid-19."
2989,Right that’s where I was getting confused.
2990,I thought antigen and antibody were the same thing.
2991,But it’s all good and I have a test set for Tuesday.
2992,And I got Moderna.
2993,"Antibody testing isn’t very good at telling if you’re currently infectious (it takes time to produce antibodies, and then they stick around for months)."
2994,An antigen test is what you need.
2995,One targeting the spike protein would test false positive if you’d recently been vaccinated.
2996,But that’s why they look for the N protein instead.
2997,"Instructions for N aren’t in the vaccine, it only codes for the spike protein."
2998,If you’ve got the N protein in your system you are infected.
2999,"(You would get a false-positive if recently vaccinated with a whole-virus vaccine like Sinovac, because that *does* include the N protein, but it probably doesn’t apply to you.)"
3000,Asking his vaccine status was probably just automatic up-selling.
3001,Pharmacy version of “do you want fries with that?”
3002,[removed]
3003,This is so sad.
3004,That poor little boy.
3005,"As I look at this photo I'll keep in mind that he was kind, like his mother wants everyone to remember."
3006,"There are people who will want to remind you that Covid only kills a very small number of children, but every parent only has a very small number of children."
3007,"Because they already have severe staffing shortages so even if a few quit because of a vaccine mandate, they’d be fucked."
3008,This is often overlooked here.
3009,The stick works; forget the carrot
3010,One of the monoclonals uses a mouse generated antibody and a human generated one.
3011,My theory is that getting sick with covid is clarifying.
3012,Theoretical covid is very different from not being able to breathe.
3013,"There is a huge difference in risk between 30 and 60, even vaccinated."
3014,"Also, given your description, maybe your dad doesn't really enjoy parties."
3015,Why take a risk in order to do something you don't r even really like?
3016,"Moderna antibody titers also decay geometrically, but it's not clear if it's exactly the same rate."
3017,"See [this](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2103916) versus [this](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.19.21262111v1), for instance."
3018,Moderna also generates some larger factor of initial antibodies.
3019,"So if we need a new dose of pfizer after some number of months, the number for moderna would simply be larger."
3020,"(Note this does not imply that Moderna is ""better""."
3021,"It's 3.3x the dose, which means we could easily have increased total vaccinations dramatically if we'd just cut it down and planned on a third dose from start."
3022,"Certainly we can make a strong argument that older people should be getting the bigger dose, though.)"
3023,In the several-years period it's really unclear how vaccination is going to proceed.
3024,It's absolutely possible that after a third dose the rate of decay will drop or stop as more B and T cells are produced.
3025,"It's also possible we'll end up with something like ""have had a booster dose within the last X months to be considered fully vaccinated""."
3026,"It is entirely clear though that protection *after* infection isn't sufficient to let protection *against* infection drop indefinitely for older people, though."

3073,She is horribly afraid on needles (she has high anxiety) but wants the vaccine very much.
3074,She is the only one in the family who does not have it.
3075,"When it all started, she was scared of getting covid, giving it to us and killing us."
3076,Poor sweetheart.
3077,I’ve been waiting patiently for this for my 9 year old.
3078,"&gt;Its made me realise just how big the world is, how populated we are

Me as well."
3079,"My friends and I were discussing how in past tragedies, there have been pockets and moments of relative peace disconnected from what was going on that are overlooked by the history books."
3080,"For example, imagine leaving bombed-out East London during the Blitz in 1940 and taking a short train, let's say about half hour long, to a peaceful little village in Oxfordshire with no war damage whatsoever."
3081,"To use a metaphor, I feel that I have been 'in the village' during COVID, lucky enough to not be directly affected at all, while of course aware of the great suffering 'in the city'."
3082,Vaccination lowers your risk compared to other people in your age bracket.
3083,But covid is still a disease that skews heavily towards being more serious in the elderly.
3084,"Very roughly, vaccination takes about 30yrs off your risk profile."
3085,"So, your vaccinated dad is now at the same level of risk as you were before you were vaccinated."
3086,And it sounds like you were being cautious before you got vaccinated.
3087,So maybe think back to then and you’ll be able to better understand his concern?

3109,It's not foolish for Australia.
3110,"They suppressed past variants, and the current wave is happening while most of the population has been vaccinated."
3111,"Mid-November at the earliest, if all the approval goes smoothly."
3112,So by Christmas break we would be looking at a decent number already vaccinated.
3113,"My personal hope, as an elementary teacher, is we get over that 50% fully vaccinated kids by March Break."
3114,After that it’s gonna take a mandate to get more people onboard.
3115,So it isn't like regular loss of smell/taste.
3116,The sensation is just GONE.
3117,"It isn't covered up, it isn't diminished, the nerves in your nose just do not transmit."
3118,I couldn't even smell rubbing alcohol.
3119,Vaccinated people are significantly less likely to get infected or to transmit it once infected.
3120,It’s not the only think to think of though.
3121,What are the quarantine rules like in your country?
3122,"In many countries an outbreak in an office would mean all the unvaccinated must quarantine while the vaccinated just test, or quarantine for a shorter period etc."
3123,"And for an individual worker, there might be other considerations, like are masks worn?"
3124,Are rapid tests used?
3125,What’s the airflow like (will they provide air purifiers)?
3126,Do I have to commute through a giant crowd of people to get to my office?
3127,"And on a whole ‘nother level - will it be voluntary, or is it a vote where the majority rules and someone at high personal risk will be forced into the office if all the young healthy folk vote for opening?"
3128,"What about workers who are healthy themselves, but live with a high risk person?"
3129,"As I said in the other comment, the idea is for us to open up once certain vaccination levels are reached."
3130,"Zero COVID isn’t a permanent strategy, but most people would rather take it slowly and cautiously until enough people are vaccinated so that hospitals aren’t overwhelmed when we due open up."
3131,"If we can be mostly opened up before Christmas, and COVID deaths in the country stay low, then I would deem our strategy a success, and I’m quite confident that both of those will occur."

3139,I had no reaction to the first shot.
3140,"About 30 minutes after the second shot, my veins in the arm I got the shot swelled up like a weight lifter’s and started hurting."
3141,The swelling went down about 4 hours later.
3142,I went to my primary physician and she said they hit a vein.
3143,I had heart palpitations after that.
3144,I am also extremely afraid of getting shots and have a tendency to pass out.
3145,I took Ativan and got it done.

3149,"In NSW and Victoria, we are well past the point of breakthrough cases as they are getting 1000+ cases a day each."
3150,"Victoria is notably more strict on their lockdowns, but both states have roadmaps towards opening up once certain vaccination targets are reached."
3151,"The rest of the country wants to prevent outbreaks occurring in their states for the time being, it’s pretty clear to us that we need to eventually open up, but we would rather take it more slowly and cautiously."
3152,The the vaccination rates also still aren’t high in most states due to a combination of NSW getting a larger share of the supply and complacency due to living a lifestyle pretty similar to pre-COVID.
3153,"I remember thinking when Italy was hit in early 2020, like the media made it seem like this was the end of Italy and bodies were piling in the streets."
3154,It seemed like the apocalypse.
3155,"Then the UK eventually got even worse numbers and it wasn’t as bad as I thought, but it made me wonder what the world thought of us."
3156,I realise i’m probably incredibly lucky but 18 months later I don’t know anyone thats died from covid and only a handful of people I know tested positive.
3157,No-one in my extended family did though.
3158,"Its made me realise just how big the world is, how populated we are and how statistics are misleading."
3159,Wouldn't a even a remote tech worker make more than unemployment then usually add on company benifits like healthcare.
3160,We could do it if the world followed China’s zero covid  method.
3161,No one would consent to that level of control though.
3162,"We could do it with testing, masking, distancing and isolation."
3163,But have to be absolutely strict.
3164,No leaks like in New Zealand or Australia.
3165,I lost my sense of smell and taste for three weeks.
3166,I love food.

3169,Those three weeks were easily the most depressed I've ever been.

3173,"Unfortunately a lot of scientists, by the nature of the scientific method and their training, are incredibly conservative and don't ever want to definitively say that anything is true without having run an experiment a million times against a control and seeing if those results support the theory."
3174,I have a scientist friend who works at the EPA and her group is very conservative when interpreting the results of scientific studies.
3175,"Even if one bee died during the study, her group will ask for another experiment to be conducted."
3176,It frustrates her because she specifically works on GMOs and knows that more are needed to feed the world as it grows hotter and growing seasons become shorter.
3177,I should I have clarified.
3178,My stepmom wands one but my dad is iffy about it.
3179,Even if people attend are vaxxed

3182,Yeah but I think my dad is doing it because he doesn’t to be social.
3183,"Idk 

I’ve been doing normal stuff since I got my two shots"
3184,mRNA vaccines are not as new as people think.
3185,The first one I'm aware of is a Zika mRNA vaccine that started human trials in 2016 and got fast tracked for approval in 2019.
3186,See https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7349928/ The volunteers are still being monitored.
3187,If there were issues we would have heard about them.
3188,"Honestly, it doesn't matter."
3189,"If you are a Dr. Or nurse who refuses to believe in science, see ya!!"
3190,"But very likely it's a low percentage, probably cleaners, security and the cafeteria staff."
3191,But he’s having a party with vaccinated people.
3192,How is that not doing anything.
3193,[removed]
3194,An ounce of prevention.
3195,Much better to not get it in the first place than to have to treat it after the fact.
3196,"With mRNA vaccination you're [80-90% less likely to catch Delta](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2108891), though this will fall over time (for 1 or 2-dose regimens; we don't know if a third dose changes this beyond bumping the 80-90% to ~95%)."
3197,"[You can have a similar amount of virus in your lungs, but for a much shorter period of time](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.28.21261295v1.full.pdf) - however this doesn't measure that the antibodies already in your mucus will neutralize some measurable fraction that quickly rises."

3217,"So, to be clear, I don't believe the pill has been tested in vaccinated people yet."
3218,"I believe the expectation, however, is that the mechanism of action is just as effective."
3219,"So if vaccinated people experience a breakthrough infection, assuming this pill receives approval, those people would be advised to take the pill to reduce the severity, duration, and risk associated with the infection as well."
3220,"Death isn't the only outcome and things like long COVID-19 or even just ""feeling bad and not being able to work"" are things we routinely treat for."
3221,"I took meds this morning for ""I slept in a weird position and my neck hurts."""
3222,"If I get COVID-19, despite being vaccinated, I wouldn't hesitate to take safe and effective medication to reduce the symptoms, duration, or risk."

3248,"To be clear, the reason why 8 weeks was chosen as the ""sweet spot"" is that it allows you to get the second dose as quickly as possible while still getting the full benefits; it's not because the second dose becomes less effective if you wait longer."
3249,Or unless you're vaccinated with the Chinese killed-virus vaccines; they'd return positive for both S and N.

3254,"But maintaining a mandate for public venues where everyone *may* need to go, places where vaccination availability can’t be guaranteed for those present, is where I think it should still be enforced."

3337,"&gt;Although nursing home deaths from Covid-19 remain dramatically down from their peak at the end of last year, a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis shows a significant uptick in August as the Delta variant swept through the country."
3338,"&gt;After declining for months, largely because of the federal effort to vaccinate residents, the number of deaths rose sharply from July to August."
3339,"Nursing homes reported nearly 1,800 deaths among their residents and staff in August, which represented the highest monthly toll since February."
3340,"&gt;The findings underscore the ongoing vulnerability of nursing home residents, who are old and in poor health, and highlight the importance of getting booster shots to people in this population."
3341,The rising number of infections could fuel more calls to vaccinate nursing home workers ahead of the federal requirement announced in August by President Biden.
3342,"&gt;”While the vast majority of Covid-19 deaths happened outside of nursing homes in July and August, the high rate of increase within nursing homes indicates that residents and staff in these settings are at risk of death during the Delta surge,” the researchers said."
3343,"The study, published Friday, did not break out how many of the dead were unvaccinated."
3344,"&gt;August saw a much steeper increase in deaths in nursing homes than in the community at large, said Priya Chidambaram, a senior policy analyst for the foundation and one of the study’s authors."
3345,"“Vaccinations are very strongly protecting people in these facilities, but the Delta variant did have an impact,” she said."
3346,"&gt;Preliminary data from September may indicate deaths are falling again, she said."
3347,"&gt;Nursing homes were especially hard hit early on in the pandemic, accounting for nearly a third of the country’s overall deaths through the end of June, according to the Kaiser analysis."
3348,"But the vaccination of residents brought the monthly number of deaths down from a high of around 22,000 in December and January to around 300 for June and July."
3349,"&gt;Although cases did increase, “we’re still nowhere near our peak in December 2020, nor at any point last year, thanks to safe and effective vaccines as well as providers’ ongoing vaccination efforts and infection control measures,” the American Health Care Association, a major nursing home trade group, said in a statement."
3350,&gt;The association said infections were largely the result of a high number of cases in the surrounding community.
3351,"The very small number of cases occurring “are largely happening in communities where there is high spread and low vaccination rates among the general population,” the group said."
3352,&gt;But the group added that it was encouraged by the recent rollout of booster shots for the Pfizer vaccine and said it was eager to follow any developments regarding the other vaccines.
3353,"&gt;While the vaccination rate among residents is now approaching 85 percent, according to the latest data from the federal Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, only about 65 percent of nursing home employees are vaccinated, roughly the same percentage as American adults overall."

3376,"&gt;JERUSALEM — Israel on Sunday introduced new rules for determining coronavirus vaccination status, making a booster shot a requirement for full inoculation and vaccination passports."
3377,"&gt;After pioneering booster shots for everyone 12 and older, Israel is believed to be the first country to condition the validity of vaccination passports on having received a booster."
3378,"&gt;The country said it would soon cancel the vaccination passports of more than a million people, mainly those who are eligible for, but have not yet received, a third vaccination shot."
3379,&gt;To be considered fully vaccinated in Israel people must meet one of the following criteria: be 12 or older and have received a booster shot at least a week ago; be within six months of having received a second vaccination shot; or be within six months of having tested positive for Covid-19.
3380,"&gt;The booster shots are Pfizer vaccinations, by far the most commonly administered in Israel."
3381,"&gt;In Israel, a Green Pass — a digital or paper vaccination certificate — is required for entry to public spaces, including restaurants, hotels, clubs, cultural venues and large private gatherings."
3382,"Unvaccinated people can only gain entry with a proof of a negative rapid test carried out at an authorized test station, which is valid for 24 hours, or a negative PCR test valid for 72 hours."
3383,&gt;The change in policy came after Israeli health officials and experts identified a significant waning of immunity in people five or six months after their second Pfizer dose and after studies indicated the effectiveness of the booster shot in preventing severe disease as Israel battled a fourth wave brought on by the highly infectious Delta variant this summer.
3384,&gt;There are signs that the fourth wave is being contained.
3385,The daily average of infections has dropped by about 54 percent over the last two weeks and the number of severe cases among the hospitalized is decreasing.
3386,"&gt;”Now is the time to be strict about the Green Pass, be cautious and not become complacent,” Prime Minister Naftali Bennett of Israel said late Saturday."

3434,"Yes, we don’t know what the situation will look like, but saying that without acknowledging just how low the risk is for vaccinated people only serves to further downplay confidence in vaccines."
3435,I've been able to live a fairly normal life with relatively small impacts from COVID for 2020 and early 2021.
3436,I live in Denver which has consistently done well in terms of managing the tradeoff between outbreak and safety.
3437,This didn't require total lockdown to control.
3438,It was always a failed strategy.
3439,You have to lockdown for eternity and still there is going to be Covid.
3440,You’re going to be exposed and probably catch it at some point eventually.
3441,The point is that the vaccine neutralizes it in most cases.

3524,Only difference will be is my side effects after my COVID 19 vaccines (x3) have all been “more” than with my flu shot so I will always plan any boosters or whatever of that for a day where I know I can take off the next day or two if needed.

3570,I don’t know exactly how other drugs that are nucleic acid analogues shut down replication.
3571,What I do know is that it’s targeting *RNA* replication via an enzyme only found in (RNA) viruses.
3572,A type of enzyme that is notorious for being extremely error prone (this is why you’ll often hear scientists say stuff along the lines of “RNA viruses mutate frequently”).
3573,"And while the virus may be trying to rapidly copy its genetic material to make as many copies of itself in as short a period of time as possible, most of your cells at any given time are not attempting to replicate."

3711,"Now that most kids can be vaccinated,  but covid is still everywhere."
3712,I get your points and they are valid.
3713,But if morale and productivity is up why go back or make it enforced to go back?
3714,"(This is what my agency leadership has said at least)

I hear this social aspect a lot, as well and again valid but it’s also not your employers responsibility to make sure you get your socializing on work time."
3715,Go out and talk to your neighbors.
3716,"I’m not anti office, I just think if the work can be done equal or better at home then people should have that option as well and neither preference party should be forced one way or another."
3717,"Also this isn’t a government thing a lot are going full remote now 

I’m playing devil’s advocate here and not attacking or disagreeing just pointing things out I’ve heard from my agency to rebuttal."
3718,Agreed.

3728,The mask mandate.
3729,"Its mandate law was in place for more than a year and even now that it expired three days ago, you don't see a difference during the day since many people still wear in in open public areas."
3730,"It was also worded in a way such as: ""you need to use mask, if it's not possible to social distance"", so it ultimately left the decision up to the people (although you will be fined if you refuse to follow certain criteria, usually after a first warning though)."
3731,Still locking down on the central coast of California because I don't want to hasten the death of my vaccinated but severely health compromised mother.
3732,We're likely staying locked down until next spring unless something dramatically changes.

3768,We got a big canopy and space heaters and we're just gonna sit outside for a couple days and hang out.
3769,"Yeah, but aren't children especially at low risk from COVID?"
3770,"This is a matter of weighing bad options:

1."

3782,"That cycle might happen, but the majority of fully vaccinated people aren’t looking at case numbers anymore so it’s kind of irrelevant, they’ve accepted their risk of having a potential breakthrough case."
3783,Unvaccinated people never cared and are going to do what they want no matter what.

3798,"I know we're not out of the woods, but this statement feels so hopelessly out of touch."
3799,What did we get vaccinated for if we can't be around other vaccinated people?
3800,This just further erodes confidence in the CDC and Fauci.
3801,I haven't seen my family since covid began.
3802,"All of us are now fully  vaccinated, so I'm going to see them."
3803,Ha this is why the vaccine manufacturers kept saying they’re ‘highly effective’ against Delta infection instead of releasing the numbers.
3804,Honestly it’s still better than nothing so I wish they’d have just released the numbers instead.
3805,Its almost like like living a normal life outweighs a 0.00000001 chance of dying.
3806,"""it's just a flu""..... As I keep hearing here."
3807,While I don't argue with the overall point you are making in regards to delays with meetings and progress...
3808,I don't see what that has to do with Fauci.
3809,"I mean he doesn't work for the FDA, he can't make them do things a different way and him doing his job as an advisor to Biden doesn't really affect anything."
3810,"I think a key difference here is if you are suddenly banned from certain activities (indoor dining, traveling) if you have 2 shots as opposed to 3, which could become 4, etc."
3811,Nobody has any clue about what will happen next.
3812,None whatsoever.
3813,That's basically the thrust of the article.
3814,Great article btw.
3815,It may be that all the people who were going to get it and spread it have gotten it and spread it.
3816,And then we just have to wait for few weeks for it to burn out.
3817,Maybe all the people who would be superspreaders are done superspreading.
3818,Maybe there will be an immunity evading variant.
3819,"(this seems pretty unlikely)

It does seem like there aren't a lot of people left to infect."
3820,And superspreading seems to be what drives spread.
3821,"Not everyone is a superspreader, especially now with vaccines."
3822,But predicting waves of this virus has always gone poorly.
3823,Who knows what it’s going to be like in 2 or 3 months.
3824,"I thought this shit was over in June, then Delta hit and our hospitals were overwhelmed."
3825,It’s hard to imagine that it wouldn’t be safe to hang out with other fully vaccinated relatives for the holidays.
3826,If it's anything like here in TN then it's just plain covid denial.
3827,It's not a problem as long as no one talks about it is a long tradition in the South.
3828,"*If* the two month cycle continues (and I'm not sure it will), we'll hit the bottom around the beginning of November."
3829,"Then cases will rise for November and December, peaking right after Christmas."
3830,He's right that it's too soon to tell.
3831,How is this changed for the better?

3836,But it would be nice for them to have some protection at least
3837,"The kids would rather wear masks than get sick, get quarantined, or have virtual school."
3838,It’s the anti-masker parents that want to use their children as political pawns that are the problem.

3840,Why pay for something that is free?
3841,Agreed.
3842,Now if only we could focus our attention and energy one day on Leukemia or asthma that kill many many more children every year.
3843,It's amazing how distracted we are from these very serious killers.
3844,I've lost a family member to Leukemia and it's one of the most awful things you can ever witness.
3845,"Oh boy, paywall..."
3846,"In many states, teachers striking is grounds for instant termination."

3855,Didn't help as much as you'd think
3856,He shot 47.7% last season and is a career 44.6% shooter.
3857,You think the vaccine will drop his shooting percentage to 0%?
3858,Nobody has any clue about what will happen next.
3859,None whatsoever.
3860,That's basically the thrust of the article.
3861,Great article btw.
3862,"I love food, too."
3863,Got COVID at Thanksgiving last year.
3864,Just getting my sense of smell and taste back now.
3865,"I’ll tell you what, losing it made me really appreciate having a sense of smell and taste."
3866,I just savor smelling the air outside on a fall day now.
3867,The hygienist at my kids dentist lost her sense of smell in January of 2021.
3868,In August she was still dealing with everything smelling rancid and had lost 20 pounds.
3869,My 9 year old son had it.
3870,He didn't seem at all bothered.
3871,"I can assure you they (kids) can indeed contract it (covid) and at the same time I believe what is being said about the severity being miniscule compared to some adults and those with poor health or very old, because that's what I saw with my own eyes."

3896,"Having Covid for even a few days sucks, and I'd rather avoid it."
3897,I can elaborate a bit on the discussion.
3898,There is some risk in doing pretty much anything.
3899,"Going to school, bicycling, driving, swimming... literally nothing is 100% safe."
3900,"We all accept that and try to minimize it with helmets, seatbelts, swimming vests, etc."
3901,"When it came to school, people weren't willing to take any safeguards like wearing masks, distancing, and (eventually) get vaccinated."
3902,That puts kids and faculty/staff at additional risk in schools.
3903,We still participate in activities that have a risk of injury/death.
3904,The point is that we should minimize the things that cause injury/death.
3905,Limit those activities and employe safeguards.
3906,"If people won't and their justification is ""not that many more kids will die if they go to school"" you need to put your money where your mouth is and get on record how many extra dead kids is an acceptable amount (beyond the typical tragedies/deaths a school district might have in a typical year)."
3907,&gt;No one says kids don't sick.
3908,"At the rally's of anti-mask protestors in Florida, this myth had been broadcasted and screamed at passersby."
3909,I have seen/heard it with my own eyes.
3910,"While most of what you say is true, there are a lot of people who are saying this particularly vicious untruth, and perpetuating other inane and illogical claims."
3911,"The fact is that children are getting ill and dying, particularly in places that are fighting vaccinations and masks, and these deaths are preventable."
3912,Your downvotes are well earned.

3919,"The only “non-normal” thing I’m doing is getting tested before I go back to the office this week, which is a lot more than I can say for my other coworkers who have traveled recently."
3920,"I believe it was Gottlieb that recently said that we’re going to enter a period where people have very different risk tolerances, and I agree with him."
3921,"Most people I know who are fully vaccinated have looked at the breakthrough risks and accepted that and aren’t taking many precautions anymore, but I do know a few people who are still too nervous about breakthroughs and aren’t going to stores etc."
3922,Can't really see one.
3923,No big bad variants on the horizon that are the sort of transmission monsters that Delta is.
3924,"In the US we're all pretty much back to normal, schools are open, so the usual ""wait until X!"
3925,"Then the REAL pandemic starts!"""
3926,hype is pretty much busted.
3927,"Holiday season could cause some swells in areas where the winter weather is crappy and people are all cooped up indoors, but the numbers game favors COVID less and less as time runs on."
3928,There's a point where there's just not enough viable hosts left for it to proliferate.
3929,"Yes, re-infection is possible, but it's not 100% and you aren't going to see everyone get re-infected 3, 4, 5 times to perpetuate the cycle."
3930,Plenty of people made sacrifices.
3931,You also seem to have completely missed the point and are almost certainty extremely risk averse yourself.
3932,Which is fine but recognize your feelings aren't reflective of the population at large.
3933,"My ""kids"" are 19, 21, and 32 and thinking about this family still hurts my heart."
3934,&gt;seeing a lot more covid patients recently.
3935,"i've heard this from a few people IRL, but i haven't seen it reflected in local numbers."
3936,are the number of patients you're seeing matching up better with whatever numbers your locality is publishing?
3937,"&gt;In this population-based cohort study of 2 392 924 individuals who received at least 1 dose of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, acute myocarditis was rare, at an incidence of 5.8 cases per 1 million individuals after the second dose (1 case per 172 414 fully vaccinated individuals)."
3938,The signal of increased myocarditis in young men warrants further investigation.
3939,&gt;This vaccinated cohort is unique in its racial and ethnic diversity and in receiving care at community hospitals with treatment reflective of real-world practice.
3940,Limitations of this study include the observational design; short follow-up time; absence of myocardial biopsy for definitive diagnosis; lack of uniform testing of all cases; possible more extensive workup of chest pain in vaccinated individuals during the immediate postvaccination period; and possible underdiagnosis of subclinical cases.
3941,No relationship between COVID-19 mRNA vaccination and postvaccination myocarditis can been established given the observational nature of this study.

3973,"The most recent and exhaustive study done on vaccination vs. natural immunity from Israel is showing natural immunity from previous infection is significantly stronger than vaccine, I just had COVID recently, am young physically active and eat clean with no pre existing conditions so I’m not in a rush to get vaccinated as of now, I got COVID from the airport wearing a cloth mask, which is when I found out cloth masks aren’t effective at all in stopping the spread."
3974,"My whole point is making everyone test upon entry to airport and requiring surgical masks to be properly worn is much more effective policy, that also isn’t ostracizing an unvaccinated population and denying their right to travel, I strongly support those above 50 or obese to get vaccinated along with anyone who has underlying health risks or just wants it for their own personal sense of security."
3975,I don’t think draconian mandates are the answer.
3976,In the US we are in a bind as a great many healthcare workers are no willing to get vaccinated and we can’t simply fire them all.
3977,What’s surprising is a high number of PHDs in America are refusing the vaccine which coupled with healthcare workers completely debunks this notion that only idiots who don’t understand anything related to healthcare or science is passing on the vaccine.

these seem like conflicting statements"
4025,"Ahh that’s not a mentality, that’s what any vaccines goal is to begin with especially COVID’s !"
4026,Hell it was largely soecified that these vaccines main priority has always been to prevent severe/hospitalizations.
4027,😂 oof it definitely does.
4028,But also I can’t spell or proof read to save my life so that doesn’t help either.

4077,Mu has been recorded since January.

4079,Nothing is (yet at least).
4080,"Despite being hospitalized twice, and almost dying, Collins said she is still considering if she wants to be vaccinated."
4081,(???)
4082,This makes no sense to me.
4083,Hopefully she doesn't use up another ICU bed and more resources because she still won't get vaxxed.
4084,"Another note on vaccine side effects:

In almost all situations, the negative side effects of a vaccine are also side effects of getting the disease itself, you’re much more likely to have side effects from the disease than the vaccine, and they’re typically worse."
4085,I live in Raleigh and my county is 70% vaccinated.

4089,Bars packed.
4090,With all that cases are dropping.
4091,To read that family gatherings are still being discouraged is downright bizarre with what is actually going on in public.
4092,"Whoa whoa whoa, we have to follow the science, not just when it's convenient."
4093,"Unvaccinated people are making it so we have to wait, regardless if we are vaccinated"
4094,It’s a few zeros lower than hospitalization for covid so I doubt there is much pressure to decrease right away
4095,Some of us live so far away from relatives that a short outdoor visit isn't plausible.
4096,I've already told my family that I won't be coming for the holidays because I don't feel safe with the amount of potential COVID exposure that I would get in a crowded airport and a long plane flight.
4097,I'm keeping my son out of school until I feel like it's safe to go back.
4098,"He has lung disease and possibly cancer, just not worth the risk."
4099,My heart breaks for parents that don't have the same choice.
4100,Yeah all the messaging should be how to safely gather for the holidays because people will be gathering
4101,"If you're vaccinated, just go."
4102,It will be a Festivus for the rest of us!

4111,Who knows by December.
4112,I don't understand people who are resuming normal life right now.
4113,"Sure if you're vaccinated you can relax and do many normal things, but most every state is still ""high risk"" according to the stats."
4114,"But mentally, people are definitely finished with the pandemic."
4115,I wonder how many articles have been written over the last two years declaring covid over or on its knees or nearly defeated.
4116,"I hope they are right this time, but I'm not holding my breath."
4117,"Mandates for the flu vaccine actually exist in hospitals and many schools already, fyi."
4118,Just pointing out the flu isn't exactly harmless either
4119,[removed]
4120,Yeah the messaging should be more “how to gather at the holidays safely” instead of “don’t gather at the holidays” because a huge majority of the country will be doing normal holidays regardless at this point
4121,I agree that this doesn't get a ton of attention.
4122,"I think this sort of compilation helps remember them, though."
4123,FYI -- I had to click through to a different article to see the teachers by state: https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/educators-weve-lost-to-the-coronavirus/2020/04
4124,AMLO?
4125,Bukele?
4126,Let’s not take the piss now.
4127,I mean the whole point of the vaccination rollout was for the whole world to go back to 2019 style normal.
4128,"If there are enough people refusing the vaccine to the point where here immunity is more hard to achieve (therefore cases are rising), then people who are vaccinated shouldn’t have too suffer because of others’ choices."
4129,I was thinking the same thing.
4130,This messaging almost has the opposite effect at this point and it helps feed the typically anti-vax sentiment of careful people just being fearful.
4131,I see where you are coming from but I think we need to be a bit more nuanced.
4132,I've been to NFL games and I wore a mask from the time I got out of my car to the time I went back into my car at the end of the game.
4133,I also went to an outdoor concert and I did take off my mask because they checked vaccine cards for all attendees.
4134,So in those situations I felt pretty safe.
4135,I'm vaccinated too by the way.
4136,Visiting grandma might mean staying at her house for an entire week and everyone else coming in from around the country all hanging out in the same living room and half the people not being vaccinated.
4137,Just saying that I could see that being a bit more dangerous depending on people's vaccination status.
4138,"He does, but he is also a politician and has to look at from everybody's safety."
4139,So he even has to worry about the morons that refuse the vaccine.
4140,He can't make a statement knowing 30% of the country is in trouble.
4141,Sadly at this point him and the CDC are not giving good guidance for those of us that did the right thing.
4142,Public health messaging jumped the shark in May.
4143,Fauci or Walensky saying “It’s gonna be another Zoom Christmas.
4144,You’ll be together next year!” would only make people laugh.
4145,This is mind boggling - she still needs to think about the vaccine ?
4146,What exactly is she going to discover more?
4147,Just…what?
4148,?
4149,I'm going to wonder out loud about this because I'm too lazy to google right now.
4150,It might even be intractable through searching.
4151,"If you've already been infected, should you get a vaccine ASAP, or would it be better to wait a month or longer, and treat the vaccine as a booster?"

4171,&gt; MARGARET BRENNAN: Do people need to start looking around and saying it's just too risky to gather with family members if there are unvaccinated children?
4172,"&gt; DR. FAUCI: Well, MARGARET, I believe just the way the CDC has recommended that when you are in a situation where you have a dynamic of virus in the community, where there's clearly a lot of spread, even if you are vaccinated and you are in an indoor setting, a congregate setting, it just makes sense to wear a mask and to avoid high risk situations."
4173,And what we should be doing is look at ventilation in indoor places.
4174,"We know now that this is clearly spread by aerosol, and when you have something spread by aerosol, you absolutely want more ventilation, which is the reason why outdoors is always much safer than indoors."
4175,"And if you are indoors, ventilation is going to be key."
4176,And that's the reason why we really should be paying attention to that.
4177,"&gt; MARGARET BRENNAN: But we can gather for Christmas, or it's just too soon to tell."
4178,"&gt; DR. FAUCI: You know, MARGARET, it's just too soon to tell."
4179,We've just got to concentrating on continuing to get those numbers down and not try to jump ahead by weeks or months and say what we're going to do at a particular time.
4180,Let's focus like a laser on continuing to get those- those cases down.
4181,"And we can do it by people getting vaccinated and also in the situation where boosters are appropriate to get people boosted because we know that they can help greatly in diminishing infection and diminishing advanced disease, the kinds of data that are now accumulating in real time."
4182,Couldn’t you just say you got Pfizer to begin with and forgot to bring your card in?
4183,[removed]
4184,none to children the age of the child in the article...

4186,The flu kills people too.
4187,These precautions would also help reduce flu deaths.
4188,Less death is good last time I checked.
4189,"Alright dude... You're right, I'm wrong."
4190,Can I still get a source on the whole thing about a good number of PhDs and doctors being anti vax?
4191,This disease has taught me that the human brain deals with crises badly and that the human pack animal instinct can still be stronger than critical thinking skills developed by all our modern educational and information systems.
4192,"For thousands of years, in the pack we stayed safe by emulating those around us and listening to the leader."
4193,People would now rather trust their belief in their pack and even risk physical death rather than leave it and risk social death.
4194,"If you haven't gotten you flu shot for the year yet, you wouldn't be complaint for some employers."
4195,"If a 3-dose series provides long-term immunity, then it won't require more."
4196,"If the immunity just inherently fades after the 3rd, then it would be about time since last shot, not number of shots, that would matter."
4197,"&amp;#x200B;

Once vaccination rates are high enough and the virus rare enough, places will probably drop the requirements."
4198,"But while in the midst of a pandemic, vaccine requirements are important unless you just want to close those activities to everyone."
4199,Center of the Universe syndrome
4200,In the US we have confirmed cases in more than 10% of people and likely many more that were asymptomatic and untested.
4201,An anti-vaxx coworker shared that same argument this morning.
4202,She said CBS News was reporting that vaccinated deaths were at almost the same level of unvaccinated deaths.
4203,"I can't find that on CBS News's site (national or local), and like u/Stumposaurus_Rex said, the anti-vaxx types will cling to whatever argument supports their idiocy."
4204,Exactly.
4205,The vaccine works.
4206,The numbers show it.
4207,I can not figure out why all the masks and things like Hollidays being up in the air.

4213,Yes.
4214,"billions of doses given, relative handful of meaningful side effects...yeah, that's effectively zero risk."
4215,"In the USA, this is not yet allowed, though some people have done it."
4216,Truthfully it is low risk but it can get the person administering the dose in trouble (theoretically) if it shows they ignored what you had previously.
4217,The FDA meeting on Oct. 14-15 includes a portion to discuss mixing/matching boosters across manufacturers.
4218,They will likely recommend/not recommend mixing of manufacturers at this meeting.
4219,I think the “northerners living outside” thing is a bit of myth.
4220,Chicago in August was around 90 degrees every day with some pretty oppressive humidity.
4221,"Outdoor dining is definitely an option 1’d it’s great that it can be used to expand dining capacity, but summer definitely isn’t all outdoor living, there is still plenty of opportunity for indoor spread."
4222,"That said, the indoor holiday season could increase spread, especially amongst unvaccinated families."
4223,"all my friends and family are fully vaccinated and we've still been careful when going out, so we're going to see them for the holidays."
4224,I never stopped seeing my immediate family.
4225,My parents are old and not going to live forever.
4226,"Even prior to the vaccine, it was worth seeing them around the holidays."
4227,"We were all careful, wore masks, got tested if we even had a cold."
4228,"So they’ve tested multiple variant specific vaccines but it turns out the original vax works just fine against delta, I think a booster of the same would do the trick is my understanding."
4229,"From a cost perspective, if there’s no big  difference, they would rather produce the OG vaccine and give out boosters to increase the number of neutralizing antibodies"
4230,"&gt;&gt;but needs to do more research on it

&gt;Obtaining the appropriate schooling and certifications to do vaccine research is going to take a while."
4231,"Unless she takes a shortcut and reads that wonderful book ""How to do your own research and die like a medieval peasant"" smh"

4244,"Double bunking rooms, boarding patients in the ED , it’s absolutely horrid."
4245,"Surgical masks are much more effective than cloth ones which is why I said put that in at least, if we required FFP2 masks with such high population there would be shortages."
4246,It would have unintended economic consequences and a very pissed off public.
4247,"The horse and buggy vs seatbelt comparison is laughable, a seatbelt doesn’t require you inject a substance in your body and isn’t required for anything other than operating a motor vehicle."
4248,You’re not denied access to the society you pay into cause you didn’t wear a seatbelt that was a nonsense comparison
4249,This is the reason no one takes these experts seriously anymore.
4250,A comment like this is hilariously out of touch with reality.
4251,As the other commenter has said Portugal had a very big spike in the beginning of 2021.
4252,However he understated it still.
4253,"It wasnt  just bad, it was one of the worst surges the world saw, proportionally ofc, if not outright the worst."
4254,At the absolute peak daily new cases hit over 16k for a day.
4255,"For perspective this would be the same as the USA having over 520k new cases in a day, surpassing by over 220k the US record."
4256,"A massive shutdown soon followed and not only were people stuck at home, the news treated them to terrifying imagery of utterly overrun emergency units."
4257,"Unlike the US the people couldn't just start deluding themselves it wasnt real because even outside of the hospitals long lines of ambulances formed all over the country

The lockdown lasted for months, and this situation probably is a big reason for the top of the chart vaccination rate."
4258,"I'm sure the vice admiral did his best but there were a lot of stumbles in the process, so it's not like he was some magical special Portuguese variable."
4259,"Another more relevant factor is the Portuguese trust in their institutions , not their political leaders, but their nationalized Healthcare, etc

Make no mistake though, that huge surge is a result of the Portuguese governments lack of action during the winter holidays, something they conveniently have forgotten since"
4260,You’re 100% correct.
4261,Most of ‘em don’t have any clue what Fauci actually said.
4262,It’s frustrating af.
4263,"Here’s what he said, btw, for anybody who is actually interested: 

&gt; DR. FAUCI: So that's the one thing I want to make sure that our viewers realize that we've done well in the sense of getting 55% of the population fully vaccinated and 64% with at least one dose."
4264,But we've got to keep pushing on the vaccination front.
4265,"&gt; MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. You said, ""Don't let your guard down."""
4266,"There are two new studies out that show COVID's gotten better at transmitting through aerosols, just through the air."
4267,What does that mean?
4268,We're going into cold weather.
4269,We're going into the holidays.
4270,Do people need to start looking around and saying it's just too risky to gather with family members if there are unvaccinated children?
4271,"&gt; DR. FAUCI: Well, MARGARET, I believe just the way the CDC has recommended that when you are in a situation where you have a dynamic of virus in the community, where there's clearly a lot of spread, even if you are vaccinated and you are in an indoor setting, a congregate setting, it just makes sense to wear a mask and to avoid high risk situations."

4282,True and true.
4283,"I’m resigned to getting Covid at some point but I’d rather wait until vaccines, testing ability, and treatments make it as safe as possible."
4284,I’d also like it if my local hospitals had more than one ER bed available between them and lots of well-rested doctors and nurses ready to devote lots of time to me if I need it.

4286,"The article states the pediatric version of the vaccine won't be delivered to Canada until the new year, so where are you getting the mid-November timeline?"
4287,"I hope it's available soon, I'm so over worrying about my child getting seriously ill or dying from this stupid pandemic."
4288,Because it isn't needed.
4289,The current vaccines are still highly effective against Delta.
4290,The only issues seen so far have been a potential decline in immunity for those 65+ and the immunocompromised.
4291,I don’t know.
4292,We all make our own choices in life.
4293,I wouldn’t expect anyone to feel bad for me if I was brainwashed by a cult
4294,My side effects for my third dose of Pfizer was basically nothing.

4322,"When MRNA vaccines were first coming out,  they said they could be re-tooled within days to a week or 2."

4324,Different.
4325,"If 3 doses of Pfizer is safer and more effective than 2 doses of Moderna, would you call Moderna worse?"
4326,"""Data has shown"" is not really evidence until you see the methodology."
4327,"You can easily get the wrong answer when trying to measure vaccine effectiveness outside of a randomized, controlled trial."
4328,"That's because vaccination campaigns in most countries prioritize people by age and also by occupational exposure risk, and also high risk settings like institutional living facilities (elders living in elderly care, etc."
4329,vs. living independently).
4330,"If you just use a yes/no model of vaccination, such as one discredited study from Israel that concluded in similar low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine, you can easily be failing to account for age-related effectiveness and also completely fail to account for occupational risk or other situational risk."
4331,"Higher risk people also know they do more social activity or contact more people, and try to get the vaccine first."
4332,"Furthermore, most people naturally use vaccination as their end goal before resuming more social behaviors, which is increasing their risk."
4333,It is easy to see how dramatically the populational risk between vaccinated and unvaccinated can be when there is no randomization involved.

4342,"Now we are living in a time where mask mandates are gone, businesses are reopened, and vaccine mandates are being put in place."
4343,"Thus, we are still taking the pandemic seriously."
4344,Same.
4345,I’d rather get Moderna
4346,"In fairness, numbers from one specific country aren't necessarily the same for how it would perform in other countries."

4352,It’s not 2020 anymore.
4353,I don’t see the big deal especially if everyone is vaccinated or recovered?
4354,I swear like 40% of Americans think like actual toddlers and small children.
4355,"They’re doing as much testing now (over 20,000 tests a day) as they were during their last outbreak, yet there are no local cases."
4356,The last death was last month.
4357,At least do a basic Google search before you type such nonsense.
4358,"Look, if everyone is vaccinated it’s pretty safe."
4359,Even if a case happens you are probably going to be ok.
4360,Curious where you are where flu shots are twice a year.
4361,"They probably would be everywhere if the flu wasn't so seasonal, but most people don't worry about summer flu."

4363,Okay then enjoy your 1-5% probability for serious illness every year.
4364,"Seems fine until you realize you gotta get lucky every year, do the math."
4365,Clearly that’s good enough for you so I don’t really have much more to say.
4366,And the payer (in your case the NHS) would likely be happy to pay $700 in pills to avoid $7000 or (much) more in the case of ICU care for several weeks.
4367,Obviously they (and all of us) would be happier to pay $70 in pills but for now the competition in price is from hospitalization

4373,My lord the disinformation is strong.
4374,"&gt; but needs to do more research on it

Obtaining the appropriate schooling and certifications to do vaccine research is going to take a while."
4375,"https://www.historyofvaccines.org/index.php/content/articles/careers-vaccine-research

&gt;Basic research focuses on the biochemistry and physical properties that disease-causing microbes use to cause damage to the host."
4376,Such research also considers the biophysical characteristics of the microbes that might be used in vaccines or drugs to prevent or interrupt the disease process.
4377,This part of the vaccine development cycle is called basic or preclinical research.
4378,"&gt;Typically, a scientist with a doctorate degree in cellular and molecular biology, biochemistry, or microbiology leads these studies; however, a wide range of research functions are carried out by research assistants who might require only a BS degree in the same fields."
4379,"In the case of vaccine development research, research associate jobs might involve growing cell lines in culture (a cell line is a clone or group of clones grown in a culture and derived from a single cell and which can proliferate indefinitely under strict lab conditions), cloning DNA, or performing assays (lab tests that look for, quantify, or measure some activity of proteins, viruses, and DNA)."
4380,Basic research jobs might also offer opportunities to become an expert at operating specialized laboratory equipment such as flow cytometers that use lasers to evaluate cells.
4381,"&gt;All basic research requires a data analysis stage, which represents yet another field of expertise: data management and analysis."
4382,These are jobs that usually require a BS but not necessarily an advanced degree.
4383,&gt;Most universities allow students to volunteer or be paid a small stipend to work in a lab—this provides valuable training and is excellent experience for getting a job after graduation.
4384,"These student jobs can range from technician assistant, in which the student may be required to prepare chemical stock solutions, wash, and sterilize glassware, and care for research animals, to senior technician, who maintains cell line stocks, tracks and breeds research animals, orders laboratory supplies, and may conduct experiments."
4385,"&gt;Once a vaccine looks like it is a serious candidate for therapeutic use, the project team moves it into the development phase, or scale-up development phase."
4386,"In development, scientists, who have advanced degrees in manufacturing engineering, and their assistants work out the best methods for producing the vaccine on a large scale."
4387,"Again, a PhD level scientist typically heads these experiments, but there are numerous jobs for individuals with BS degrees"
4388,"&gt; Fauci and basically every other one of these professionals have a risk tolerance wildly lower than average people

Because they care about everyone and are focusing on the spread instead of individual impact."
4389,"Average people are only calculating personal risk tolerance, and not caring about spread."
4390,This is quite literally their job.
4391,&gt;  They are comedically out of touch.
4392,What?
4393,"No, they have a serious, important job to do that affects hundreds of millions of people, and you are a nobody whose opinions affect virtually nobody."
4394,No shit.
4395,Live in a state that pays more than $7.25/hour.
4396,Here in Connecticut it’s $12/hour and stores are offering more than that and hiring bonuses everywhere.
4397,"Or, maybe vote for someone in Congress who supports the $15 minimum wage."
4398,There is no reason not to migrate to digital verification at this point - there are various frameworks developed that we can utilize today.
4399,"We know mandates are helping push vaccine uptake, and giving anti-vaxxers space to abuse their rights is what's dragging our recovery efforts."
4400,Implement digital passes as the EU and a majority of Asia has and call it a day.
4401,You and I both know those cases and deaths are nearly exclusively attributed to the unvaccinated.
4402,Stop pretending like the vaccine doesn't exist.
4403,Alright I missed this one.
4404,So that is basically everything being done to avoid something that has proven benefits.
4405,One can also avoid the seat belt mandate because by using a horse and carriage so I don't see this as a valid argument.
4406,"And btw, you keep bringing up the ineffectiveness of cloth masks, which is true but you guys still use surgical masks over there which have been unacceptable here in Germany for quite a while now."
4407,Only FFP2 masks allowed because the surgical ones aren't good enough.
4408,"So yeah, those masks aren't the solution either."
4409,"&gt; Yeah literally no one is listening to him anymore

You are very wrong on that."
4410,"But if you are vaccinated, he's always been saying you can see family, so you aren't saying anything that he hasn't?"
4411,Maybe you should have been listening?
4412,Facebook is people.
4413,"&gt;As I understand it, whether vaxxed or not, unvaccinated and vaccinated can equally carry it, transmit it and aquire it."
4414,"&gt;  
&gt; Is that correct?"
4415,"That is incorrect, though it hasn't been clearly explained by a lot of the media, so it's understandable that you would have that misunderstanding."
4416,Vaccines do protect you from even an infection of COVID between 50-95% of the time.
4417,"The actual statement is that given you have COVID, at the peak you are just as contagious unvaccinated or vaccinated."
4418,The first thing to understand is that this is \*given that you have COVID\*.
4419,"Vaccinated people are several times less likely to get infected, and as such several times less likely to spread it."
4420,"As such, your example would be unlikely as the second office would probably have fewer people with COVID in it."
4421,"5 in each is still possible, but it's already a scenario where the vaccine has not performed as well as it does on average."
4422,"The second thing to understand is that even in your example, the second office will have far fewer people contract COVID."
4423,"Even if those 5 people spread COVID equally, then the second office will have much more protection against contracting COVID from the 5 infected people."
4424,"The one caveat is that the vaccines do seem to be losing protection against infection over time, while the protection against hospitalization and death is more stable, which is why boosters are so important."
4425,"This is likely because the body has two different defense mechanisms: antibodies, which are shorter term but faster and more responsible for protection against cases and spread, and B and T cells, which are longer term but slower and more responsible for protection against hospitalization and death."
4426,"The third thing to understand is that even if you have COVID, being vaccinated might still mean you are less likely to spread it."
4427,"This is because while the peak amount of virus appears to be the same, its quite possible that you're at your peak for a shorter time."
4428,"I don't have as good an understanding an effect of this though, I think its still being researched."
4429,"However, the overall thing to realize is that even if the vaccine protects against infection only 50% of the time, that's 50% less chance of both someone catching COVID and someone spreading it to someone vaccinated."
4430,"Eventually at high enough levels of vaccination this creates what is called herd immunity, where even though a breakthrough happens every now and then, that breakthrough won't be able to lead to an explosion of cases but will stay isolated with a few people."
4431,"Unfortunately, the CDC and FDA have decided that cases and spread don't matter and are as such responsible for causing significant confusion around the massive benefits of vaccines relating to reduction in cases and spread that indirectly translate to reductions in hospitalizations and deaths."

4439,No one in NZ believed we would remain covid free in perpetuity.
4440,They stuffed up the vaccine roll out so we ended up in another very strict lockdown.
4441,The vaccine is readily available now and the borders will open soon.

4663,It declined but that transaction would still be recorded.
4664,"I hope they don't find the guy - their incompetence shouldn't be rewarded, and kids don't just stop needing diapers - you just make things worse making trouble for that family."
4665,Ah I see.
4666,Well bars aren't a critical place to be.
4667,The vast majority of bar going folk would probably just rather go maskless than pull their mask up and down dozens of times while they drink and or eat.
4668,I'd say mask mandates are more practical in places like trains and grocery stores since nobody is actively eating or drinking.
4669,Are you me?
4670,I don't understand why Nursing homes didn't have a regulatory or even a self imposed mandate as soon as the vaccines were available.

4674,"The fact is many of these places get visitors, friends, family etc."
4675,Anyone could have brought covid in.
4676,It's unfair to blame low paid workers who probably make $9 an hour to do very hard work.
4677,Most nursing home workers are quitting because they don't like being disrespected and blamed.

4687,That is hilarous tho
4688,There are plenty of restaurants hiring.... although some of them might require proof of vaccination also....or wearing a mask.
4689,[removed]
4690,There are so many jobs available out there.
4691,Get one!
4692,I am not looking forward to the fucking idiots protesting kids getting vaccines.
4693,2 pediatric deaths since January is 2 too many.
4694,It could also be people just switching jobs.
4695,I just started my new job - I know three others that recently started applying to new companies (never went on covid benefits) and through the grapevine heard of at least a handful others in the process of switching companies or just started their new jobs.
4696,"There are also some medical staff, like a friend of mine, that quit or are planning to, not over the vaccine, but because they are just done, and looking for a career change."
4697,"The market is super in favor of employees (has been for a couple months now) and a lot of people are taking advantage, regardless if they never stopped working through the pandemic."
4698,Paid or unpaid?
4699,LWOP would sure make sense here.
4700,If he was against getting the vaccine then why didn't he stand by his principles?
4701,People act with their wallets.
4702,"When unvaxxed were going to get fired, most quickly got their shots."
4703,"Likewise when the bennies go away, people will have the motive to take a job."
4704,"Anti-vaxxers all focus on deaths, but not long covid."
4705,"For any of them, my question is what is your plan if you get covid and become a long hauler?"
4706,How much paid sick time &amp; PTO do you have?
4707,"If you get covid at work, you don't get workcomp, so do you have disability insurance?"
4708,I got covid on the job (part time baggage handler for an airline) and there really was no way I could do that job for almost 8 months after I tested positive due to chest pain and shortness of breath.
4709,"Friends who are FT baggage handlers just had to some how suffer through it since they couldn't take the time off, financially."
4710,I work primarily doing software development as a contractor.
4711,There were a few months that my income was low just cause i couldn't work enough hours due to all of the brain fog I had.
4712,They comprehend.
4713,They just don’t care.
4714,Well minus CEUs.
4715,In think a lot of nurses want to continue to learn but also have to learn.
4716,You have some people that mail it in at Clinics.
4717,However most in direct patient care are all very good.
4718,This whole thing has become a farce.
4719,People who are vaccinated should get together.
4720,It's time to move on and stop acting like people should put will keep giving up on important events.
4721,People who aren't vaccinated don't give a shit what the cdc says so whatever advice the cdc gives them is irrelevant.
4722,Same here.
4723,Live in MA and have followed all of the protocols since the start and are essentially back to normal.
4724,Myself and fully vaccinated family will 100% be gathering for holidays this year.
4725,That’s the whole point of getting the vaccine!
4726,It is unethical to continue giving a placebo when the investigators know the real drug works.
4727,It is also unethical to continue running an experiment involving humans when you know what the outcome will be.
4728,"In some trials, when the drug is found to be successful, all patients will cross over to receive the experimental drug (this is especially true in cancer trials where patients are on the drug for a while)."
4729,I don't know whether or not they did that in this study but I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't because the rest of the patients had probably not yet accrued to the study (been recruited and joined).
4730,That some hypothetical people missed out on the effective drug is irrelevant.
4731,"Once the efficacy was shown during trial, the company needs to get FDA approval in order to get the drugs on the market."
4732,Emergency use authorization can been used if needed.
4733,But it's unethical to continue enrolling patients on the trial.

4735,I can’t wait :/
4736,"No, it fucking isn't."
4737,"If we look at all cases Ireland ever had, more than half are Alpha variant."
4738,Why?
4739,Because Ireland lifted restrictions around Christmas last year to allow people to congregate.
4740,"Afterwards, we were in Lockdown until spring."
4741,Taiwan have 800+ deaths from their last outbreak.
4742,"They just didn't do wide testing, so at the very least a lot of the asymptomatic infected are not recorded."
4743,Are CVS or Walgreens still questioning people on if they're qualified when they get a booster?
4744,"And, I'm not talking about those that don't meet all of the necessary reasons."
4745,I received Pfizer over 6 months ago and would rather not be hassled when I go in to get it.
4746,TIA
4747,It feels so out of touch when I read things like this.
4748,"I live in New England where we’ve taken the pandemic as seriously as anyone and life is pretty much normal here, even in stores I don’t see more than 20% of people with masks on anymore."
4749,"We have full capacity sports games, packed bars and restaurants etc."
4750,No one is avoiding gatherings.
4751,"In my personal life I only know 2 families who are still avoiding going places, and that’s because they have young kids at home."
4752,"Everyone else I know, even people with young kids, are basically back to their normal lives."

4759,"If the FDA can’t be bothered to meet about a vax approval with any sense of urgency and Fauci is out doing press tours, perhaps he can go in and help them find the sense of urgency he’s pressing on the American populace."
4760,Not denying COVID is a big deal and my entire family is vaxxed.
4761,I just don’t see the same level of effort or urgency at the FDA.
4762,A 3 week or 4 week lag in meeting versus when the data is received on a vax is unacceptable.
4763,90%+ of us are at home now and can get bugged at all hours of the day for a “quick Zoom call.” There’s zero reason why the FDA can’t do the same.
4764,🤷‍♂️
4765,Spoiler alert:  People will gather for holidays.
4766,Even if you tell them not too.
4767,My company has the same policy and it's not that big of a deal

4773,Idiot
4774,My 10 year old got covid within the first week of going back to school and I got a breakthrough infection a few days later.
4775,It was honestly kind of soul crushing.
4776,What?
4777,Do you think Fauci is the one who is putting in late nights in the lab?
4778,Or do think the FDA makes everyone stop working until Fauci makes a statement on Christmas?

4805,You'd take it once infected to reduce viral replication and thus the severity and length of the infection.
4806,It's somewhat similar to Remdesivir in that both are prodrugs that form nucleoside analogs.
4807,Remdesivir is given intravenously and seems to operate by halting viral RNA replication.
4808,Molnupiravir is given orally and incorporates into the replicating RNA and causes errors (mutations) in successive replications.
4809,Errors accumulate and the resulting sequence is no longer viable.

4922,"Might want to read [the actual study that the article is talking about from the CDC and what the CDC is saying about this](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7021e1.htm):

&gt; **What are the implications for public health practice?"
4923,"**
&gt; 
&gt; Mask requirements for teachers and staff members and improved ventilation are important strategies in addition to vaccination of teachers and staff members that elementary schools could implement as part of a multicomponent approach to provide safer, in-person learning environments."
4924,The validity of masks was never put into question by the study.
4925,"If anything, all the study showed was that improved ventilation is incredibly useful."
4926,"Additionally, the article has this very confusing paragraph:

&gt; “A year ago, I said, ‘Masks are not the end of the world; why not just wear a mask?’” Elissa Schechter-Perkins, the director of Emergency Medicine Infectious Disease Management at Boston Medical Center, told me."
4927,"“But the world has changed, there are real downsides to masking children for this long, with no known end date, and without any clear upside.” She continued, “I’m not aware of any studies that show conclusively that kids wearing masks in schools has any effect on their own morbidity or mortality or on the hospitalization or death rate in the community around them.”

This individual asks for evidence for masks, but yet doesn’t quote any evidence of the detrimental effects of masking kids for this long?"
4928,I’ve not heard of any negative effects of masking.
4929,This article is littered with examples like this.
4930,Cherry-picked quotes that support its claim without properly considering what’s being said.
4931,I'm reading that EMA has approved third dose (Pfizer) for **all** over 18s by 6 months past the second dose.

4940,All y’all dumbshits just knock yourselves out?
4941,"Maybe there are lots of people who deserve that message, but the hospital workers in those regions don’t."
4942,He’s a professional and a scientist so he still needs to give out the best advice he can.
4943,With that logic there’s no need to hate antivaxxers since the costs of not taking the vaccine would largely be privatized with little externalities (except in cases where ICUs are filled).
4944,"Both our experiences are somewhat different, I live in an suburban city outside of Boston, I want to say about 95% of the time I go to the supermarket/corner store/take-out, etc., people are masked up."
4945,You tend to be more tolerant of non-masked folks if you're surrounded by people who are most-likely vaccinated like yourself.

4974,Dude my own parents were like this at the start and it cost me months of my life (long covid).
4975,That changed their outlook a bit but they still couldn't shake the plethora of propaganda they had been fed.
4976,I know the demographic isn't just the fucking idiots you see in rallies and on the internet.
4977,It's sad that there are idiots beyond  that little demographic but it is the sad truth.
4978,"And I've met manyyyy people with this mindset throughout (I live in Germany), and here's the absolute shocker, none of them were even remotely knowledgeable in any field of science, yet they had the confidence which truly correlates with the Dunning-Krüger effect."
4979,"And yeah, I assume fewer people will get boosters over time, but not doing any of this just means that we're doing nothing."
4980,"First they were against the whole lockdown/social distancing stuff, now vaccines... Makes sense because they were already behind the rest of the world by many years so why shouldn't that trend continue?"
4981,Are you vaccinated?
4982,I look at it like this:  it's more of a thing for those who aren't vaccinated at this point.
4983,"All our patience has worn thin, and if you're responsible and are vaccinated, it's something you shouldn't worry about."
4984,"This isn't about blanket guidelines, more or less know your risks (like  say, if you live in FL vs VT for example)"
4985,"I get that about young kids, but again, of all the people I know with kids under 12, only 2 of them are still keeping their kids home."
4986,"99% of people I know who have unvaccinated kids are living their lives normally, so I don’t even think having some kids who still aren’t vaccinated is going to keep people from gathering for the holidays."
4987,"I was just at Universal and the amount of kids I saw under 12 was insane, it seems a lot of parents have even accepted the risk of covid for unvaccinated kids."
4988,I’m in uk it’s up to their jobseekers chap or woman if they get sacked
4989,That’s a dumb headline then.

The one caveat here is what mode of transportation you will require."
5073,Can you get there in your own car?

5076,This was a major contributor to the horrible spike last winter.
5077,"He was prompted this answer, he didn't directly dictate it."
5078,"And the point is if he says, ""yes, I will announce right now that Christmas gatherings are a a good idea, and safe,"" he'd be doing a disservice."
5079,"Because in groups that have many unvaccinated, it would not be a good idea to have a large gathering."
5080,So how do you expect him to answer this?
5081,"Most the people in this thread are like, my whole family is vaccinated, and he is saying I can't get together with the."

5095,My organization has a variety of flexible working schedules.
5096,At this point the only option unavailable is going into the office.
5097,I understand the safety precautions however I miss the 2 days I had to go into the office.
5098,It broke up the monotony of the workweek.
5099,I don’t like that my work space is totally intertwined with my house.
5100,Haven’t heard anything about increased productivity from my organization (but I’m a lowly Gs-12).

5133,Our anti-vax neighbor refuses to provide a source.
5134,Maybe they're tired of getting laughed at?
5135,"(A shame, really."
5136,In more ways than one.
5137,It's useful to know where all that s*it comes from.)

5139,It's a fairly easy read.

5144,"If you are vaccinated, live your life."
5145,"It was designed this way so that the coasts didn't rule the land w/o flyover states having any say, I guess."
5146,"USA, and I don't qualify, just went and got it again as I did the first time."
5147,"I did it because I'm going on a trip soon to a very unvaccinated part of the world (obviously I considered not going but chose to proceed, feel free to shame me) and I want to do everything I can to lower my chances of being super-spreader guy."
5148,"I have very high exposure day-to-day as a part of my job anyway, so it seemed like the smart thing to do."
5149,"In case there's confusion, by fourth I mean the second dose of my second vaccine."
5150,"ok great   
may i ask a dumb question  
 is the booster shot exactly the same makeup as the 2 shot."
5151,(I mean it's like getting a 3rd shot of mRNA)
5152,"Do you know, was it the full moderna dose as if you were getting your first shot?"
5153,Or was it a partial dose?
5154,This is true and look how well that worked last fall/winter.
5155,"I hope this year will be a massive improvement, though, since we are truly better armed."
5156,"Since hardly anyone in my family is vaccinated, I will be sitting this season out again."

5162,"&gt; Not sure what you mean by “against”

So, nothing against holiday traveling or seeing family?"
5163,Especially if you’re fully vaxed?
5164,My family did a really great job of not gathering for Christmas or Easter last year and I was so proud of them.
5165,Then the week or two before the vaccines started being offered to everyone they threw a big party and I just face palmed so fucking hard.

5168,700K reported deaths from covid...
5169,Uhoh lots of posts incoming about communism etc around this...watch.
5170,My wife is due any day now to have our first baby.
5171,Luckily we decided a long time ago that we were doing cloth diapers and we have a ton of them so this wouldn't have any effect on us.
5172,"Honestly, as awful as diapers are for the environment, it is probably a net positive that people will be using less of them and maybe more people will be on board for going with cloth diapers."
5173,My main concern would be for the lower income families.
5174,Cloth diapers don't cost more than plastic when you factor everything in.
5175,But the upfront cost is pretty steep.
5176,A cost that most low income families might struggle to cover.
5177,"So while I fully support people using less plastic diapers that take 500 years to decompose, they can also be a necessity for those with tight budgets."
5178,"So if you have cloth diapers, make sure to donate them"
5179,My instinct is once at least Pfizer is approved for kids we'll see that.
5180,At this point all adults are eligible (and have been for some time) and if unvaccinated people get covid that's on them.
5181,"Kids are a different story right now because they can't be vaccinated, but give it a year or whatever and schools mandating it alongside the rest of them and I think it will be 100% back to normal."

5201,Like the yearly flu shot.
5202,FYI I had the facial tingling numbness during both a covid infection and then again after receiving the JJ vaccine.
5203,Went away in both cases but maybe some of us are just susceptible to it.
5204,Are you honestly suggesting that resuming a normal social life is not and should not be one of the goals of the vaccine???
5205,I don’t even know how to respond to that.
5206,Why anyone listens to him for science facts is beyond me.
5207,He decided his science fact based on what he thinks “the public can handle” and he lied under oath to congress multiple times.
5208,Because of the Republican party there essentially are no reliably centrally accessible medical records in this country.
5209,That's one of the many issues that universal healthcare fixes.
5210,Well...sorta.
5211,It depends on what version of the sales pitch you were listening to.
5212,"As things stand now, they're quite good at keeping people from getting really sick, and very good at keeping people out of the hospital."
5213,"Breakthrough cases, however, are much more significant than people realize."

5215,"I've lived across the country from my family for 7 years, I've never been home for Christmas."
5216,This is the first year I have a job that gives 2 weeks paid vacation over the holidays.
5217,We're all vaccinated and there is not a force in heaven or on earth that will stop me from seeing them on Christmas especially after spending last Christmas literally entirely alone for a week.
5218,That was the whole point of doing what we were all supposed to do for so long.
5219,Except when your family is antivax like mine.
5220,Byeeee
5221,The messaging and optics is terrible.
5222,I don’t know how else to explain it.
5223,We’ll have to wait and see if it’s safe for families to see each other for holidays!
5224,"but don’t worry, it’s fine for for 100k person events as long as everybody flashes a piece of paper on the way in!"
5225,"For the record, I’m fine with the large gatherings and think requiring vaccines to attend them is a great idea."
5226,"But it’s ridiculous to entertain the notion that vaccinated family and friends should reconsider getting together for the holidays, or ever for that matter."
5227,The message should be “hey if you’re vaccinated you have little to worry about.
5228,"If you weren’t worried about getting sick when you did this any other year, then you are good to go for this one once you’ve gotten your shots."
5229,Want to be extra safe?
5230,"Make sure grandma got her booster, and think about getting one for yourself too if you qualify.”"
5231,"I'm as pro vaccines as they come, and with my family being out of the country, there's no way I'll be gathering with them for Christmas."
5232,"With that said, there is no world in which people will avoid gathering over the holidays."
5233,"The ones who did celebrate in person last year, without vaccines, absolutely will again this year."
5234,"Those who skipped last year's, and are likely to be vaccinated this time, will not miss a second one."
5235,"The only realistic solution, if Delta is still an issue with breakthrough cases, is to offer boosters for the general population in November (about 6 months out from when most people started getting their shots, and where effectiveness may start seeing some reduction), so we can keep as many reasonable people out of hospitals as possible."
5236,We won't be able to do anything about the rest.
5237,I'm sorry for all of the medical personal who may miss yet another holiday trying to save the life of idiots (as well as the lives of those who did everything right but got unlucky).
5238,J&amp;J is still effective against delta and other variants.
5239,"I wouldn't equate a slight decrease in immunity against mild illness to ""not having any immunity""."
5240,Here is a video about this.
5241,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3odScka55A

My wife had the J&amp;J and teaches preschool kids and so is also a little (emphasis on little) worried but not too much because she is vaccinated."
5242,She's looking into a booster.
5243,"&gt;Except nobody is getting ""the flu"" anymore, or ""pneumonia"".. All of those deaths or probably more than 90% are being lumped together and counted as  covid deaths."
5244,Non-covid related respiratory deaths are practically nonexistent anymore.
5245,"&amp;#x200B;

Wow!"
5246,"You mean to tell me that after a year of encouraging mask use and other protocols to limit the spread of an infectious flu-like disease, there are far fewer cases of the flu?!"
5247,It's almost like most pandemic protocols we've used were designed in response to a deadly flu pandemic or something!
5248,"&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, by your logic literally zero people have died of HIV/AIDS ever since that virus alone hasn't killed a single person..."
5249,"Instead, opportunistic infections and conditions caused by that virus kill those people... Or, also by your logic, ""***I*** didn't kill that person!"
5250,"They died of blood loss from the effects of the bullet that happened to be fired from my gun, that's not my fault!"""
5251,"Very few people die of just having the flu, or any other virus for that matter."
5252,"They die of the effects that the virus has on the body, in the case of Influenza, by multiple organ failure caused by cytokine storm where your immune system overreacts to an infection, or ARDS caused by your lungs filling up with fluid again due to the immune response to that infection."
5253,"&amp;#x200B;

Pneumonia isn't a stand-alone virus or pathogen derived illness.."
5254,"It's a condition where your lungs fill up with fluid that is ***caused*** by several dozen viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites, and even environmental pollutants."
5255,"Covid and Influenza are just two of the common causes of Pneumonia, which is why when someone who has either Covid or Influenza dies of Pneumonia, they are listed as dying of that virus."
5256,"In regards to my previous metaphor, Pneumonia, ARDS, and Multiple Organ Failure are the ""bleeding to death"", Covid-19 or Influenza are the bullets, and people spreading ignorant bullshit with no grasp of the actual way any of this works are more often than not the asshole who pulled the trigger."
5257,There's more than a committee.

5264,"Not sure what you mean by ""against"" but the question was asked and you specifically didn't quote that part."
5265,It's a dumb question and it's not the most graceful answer knowing how people love to take soundbites out of context.
5266,"Off the cuff, a better answer would have been ""if these trends continue, the holidays  might be fine."
5267,"and the best way to make sure of that is for everyone to get vaccinated as soon as possible"""

5270,"Even if mandates under EUA *can* be made, plenty of companies and organizations were still waiting on full approval before issuing theirs and a ton dropped within days of the full approval."
5271,"I think it's a matter of ease and perception, not necessarily legal technicality."
5272,"Given how something like maybe 40% of people are fully vaccinated even by official recommendations (and by Christmas, it could be much less)."
5273,It makes some sense their guidance is tailored to the unvaccinated and partially vaccinated majority.
5274,"That said, it also depends where you live."
5275,Places like Alabama are still basically at 0 spare ICU capacity.
5276,"They shouldn't be doing anything to make things worse, so the advice may actually reasonable (even though they're in that mess in the first place since they don't follow any recommendations)."
5277,"But a place like Connecticut, where ICUs are basically unaffected by covid for now, it seems much more silly."

5279,Oh look another one who made fun of it until they got it... What a messed up world we now live in that we can't do things because of making a statement rather than just to keeping someone else safe.
5280,The world gets more divided each day...
5281,"Probably less that people are ""totally ignoring it"" and more that the paper is pre-release and hasn't been peer reviewed, so its not getting wide distribution in media until people are comfortable with the results one way or another, and those who know about it are probably cautiously optimistic, but again, holding the ""applause"" till it gets more eyeballs on it."
5282,&gt;What did we get vaccinated for if we can't be around other vaccinated people?
5283,To hasten the end of the pandemic?
5284,So vulnerable people (like those for whom vaccines don’t offer enough protection) won’t needlessly suffer and die?
5285,Making one’s own life personally more pleasant isn‘t the only reason people do things.
5286,"Dangling the carrot of “you can go back to normal” is nice, when it’s true (e.g."

5292,"His job is to be straight forward and factual, not attempt to manipulate people through editorializing."

5294,"There will always be risks, this isn't going anywhere, but understanding how to mitigate that risk *within the limits of what people will realistically tolerate* is what is needed here."
5295,"The vaccines are effective against Delta as far as preventing hospitalizations and deaths, but Delta is more contagious with higher viral loads, so even vaccinated people can catch and spread it easier than Alpha."
5296,"If you're reading about the pandemic, you probably knew that before you typed your comment."
5297,I wouldn’t advise anything since I’m not a doctor but I don’t think you can choose to get a 2 shot of Moderna or pfizer if you have J&amp;J but only one shot as your supplemental shot.
5298,This was at Zuckerberg hospital and they didn’t try to book me for a 2nd shot at all

5311,We had hardly anyone vaccinated so we kind of needed to.

5329,Niiiice!
5330,I hope this becomes the standard
5331,"It’s fascinating that vaccines have become so politicized that another experimental drug, a polymerase inhibitor with clear side effects, will be immediately embraced by quacks as a reason to avoid vaccination."
5332,No one is pretending vaccines don't exist.
5333,"Sadly, many people are pretending CDC guidelines don't."
5334,"""Even if you are fully vaccinated, if you live in an area with substantial or high transmission of COVID-19, you will be better protected if you wear a mask when you are in indoor public places."""
5335,94% of the US is experiencing Substantial or High Transmission today.
5336,"Yes, less than 2% of COVID deaths in 2021 were fully vaccinated, but too many people being ""just-vaxxers"" and unwilling to continue some precautions are contributing to COVID's continued spread and deaths."
5337,"I would think that getting Covid would be much more likely to impact her supply, as would stress about getting Covid."
5338,I doubt there have been actual studies on supply though.
5339,Drinking tons of water and nursing often would help any potential dip though.

5341,But the percentage of extra antibodies is entirely consistent with the efficacy-vs-antibodies curve connecting all of our vaccines.

5606,Was this one-shot booster that you received?
5607,I received J&amp;J in march and now want Pfizer mRNA shot.
5608,Should i get the 2-shot of Pfizer or one Pfizer booster shot?
5609,Which would you advise?
5610,TY!
5611,Also was this at the Zuckerburg hospital where you can walk in no appt needed?
5612,Guy needs some pr training then.

5697,Some more realistic recommendations might have included: Boosters when you're eligible (most who had Pfizer already are) and making sure you avoid high risk activities for several weeks before you get together with more vulnerable relatives.
5698,"This might mean skipping bars, concerts or indoor dining in November and December."

5742,"Unless there’s a variant that completely negates the vaccine, I’m not putting off my plans (and since Covid is here forever, there’s no point in worrying about that since there’s never a point where that won’t be a risk)."

5757,Mid credit scene: The ones that will most fervently gather will be anti-mask unvaccinated individuals.
5758,"If you live in a city you are already getting thousands of people from out of town daily via sporting events, conferences, business, concerts, tourism, and basic supply chain distribution."
5759,All that stuff is going on right now.

5817,The vaccine turned COVID into a bad cold for me.
5818,I am still getting sense of smell back but I had only two days of headaches and chills then nothing.
5819,No long COVID either (just anecdotle).
5820,Even if the vaccine dont provide 100% protection I would still get them in a heart beat to turn a terrible virus into a common cold type virus.
5821,Well put.

5849,From the press release they(Merck) say no.
5850,But they also say to not try to create offspring while on the course of the treatment.

5861,I would argue not.
5862,"For instance, a vaccinated person wearing a mask isn't being ""careful"" it's being stupid when the logic applies: *masks don't protect you they only protect others... if you're sick*."
5863,"Or avoiding ""normal"" behavior."
5864,"There's a lot of ""be careful"" out there which drives the justification for onerous restrictions on the population."

5880,"Most people stay home when they are sick, and even unvaxxed people will wear masks where required (although cloth masks have been proven to not be effective at all and still acceptable, and plenty of vaxxed still wear mask under their noses) the idea the unvaxxed population is a specific demographic has been thoroughly debunked as propaganda it’s actually a very diverse demographic not just in age, ethnicity but also education."
5881,"The boosters are not designed for the variants, and a much smaller pool of vaccinated will continuously get boosters every 4-6 months."
5882,There's a near zero risk to meeting your family members outside while wearing masks and having been tested.
5883,[deleted]
5884,Taking a test is stagnant.
5885,It only shows at that time if I had/didn't have covid.
5886,"Unless it's an immediate result, not that effective."
5887,"And like other people, even with the mask I would be tempted to want to hug them, interfering with the 6 feet."
5888,I'm not one to take covid lightly.
5889,"Have spent 2 years doing everything, waiting for a vaccine."
5890,Now I and they have it.
5891,"If there was ever a ""safe time"" to visit family, it's now."

5913,"I couldn't read the full article because of a paywall, but a quick Google search says Boston's population is over 4 million."
5914,Anyone know where the difference in numbers is coming from?
5915,I just got over a breakthrough case.
5916,Got J&amp;J in March.
5917,The promise of the vaccine held as my case was relatively mild.
5918,I'm hoping a booster on top of having previously been infected really triggers one hell of an immune response.
5919,LMAO.
5920,I went to a Jan packed baseball game the other day.
5921,No one cares anymore.
5922,Either you are vaccinated or you aren't and that's how it is going to be.

5925,not sure why you're getting voted down this is the right take
5926,Game changing as in how Delta changed dramatically how fast the virus spread not what the technical mutation was.
5927,Now is it possible that with almost nobody left the virus mutates to do further escape current vaccines?
5928,"I have no idea, I'm just a dumb guy on the internet."
5929,That is EXACTLY what I had in mind lmao
5930,"People said that in June as well pre-delta, so I would agree both with things looking good right now but also too soon to say what it will look like in 3 months"
5931,Yeah I don't listen to him anymore.
5932,Everytime I see an article like the OP quoting Fauci I roll my eyes.
5933,"(Not at you OP, just the article in general)"
5934,I think he's obviously concerned about the emergence of a more dangerous variant between now and Christmas.
5935,"Also, it's a stupid question."
5936,"As the former first Lady said, ""fuck Christmas"""
5937,"Well, depends which religion/cult the person in question could be in."
5938,I have a friend with a newborn that's breastfeeding.
5939,She is fully vaxxed.
5940,But that 6 month window is coming up soon.
5941,She's in a high risk environment (law enforcement).
5942,She wants the booster shot but is worried about whether a booster will stop her milk supply.
5943,"Turn off the tap, so to speak."
5944,"I'm asking the internet, can anyone provide studies that show whether an mRNA covid shot limits or stops a breastfeeding mom's milk supply?"
5945,The booster shot is supposed to cater to new variants.
5946,Someone not willing to take the original vaccine is mot gonna be getting any boosters either.
5947,So the whole vaccine efficacy waning off is besides the point.
5948,People who are gonna get it will also get protection against the new strains soon.

5956,I’ve seen some not get it “because my family wouldn’t be happy if I got it”.
5957,I had a family member tell me to stop talking to their mom about it because they’re not getting it.
5958,"I never said I was against masks, especially in schools where they should be required."
5959,As should vaccination for all employees of the school and any kids old enough.

prevention against infection for delta was 86.7%"
6390,"When I follow the links to the studies I see that symptom onset was as early as 8-42 days, most commonly 43-180 days?"
6391,Comparing the number of Pandemrix doses administered to the Covid vaccine doses administered I'd think we'd definitely have VAERS going nuts if anything like that was happening since the whole world has possible Covid vax side effects under a microscope.

This being said, several months ago I listened to a podcast which featured a prominent, experienced British doctor - a veteran of the healthcare scene (I forget the name)."
6398,He made an observation that has stuck with me since and it's as follows.
6399,Our hospitals - at least in the West - have been built to be one-stop-shops for all manner of ailments and conditions.
6400,Which is why they have been breeding grounds for Covid as the virus is circulated throughout hospitals via their HVAC systems.
6401,"With hindsight, he said, we'd have been better off treating Covid patients in large, heated, medically-equipped tents away from hospital locations proper."
6402,i.e.
6403,"segregate confirmed Covid cases in dedicated, equipped, ventilated tents so that hospitals can continue as normal and those sick from Covid receive the care they need and minimizing the risk of infecting others."
6404,Treating patients in tents away from hospitals carries with it bad optics from a political angle - and it does look very third world - but it may well be the best approach when dealing with a largely unvaxxed population such as that of NZ's.

6585,Yeah.
6586,"I followed every precaution to the T from wiping down groceries, to getting vaccinated and avoiding gatherings."
6587,Not doing it another holiday season when there are others who never gave a damn in the first place.
6588,The Olympic bubble was one of the strictest quarantines on the planet and it led to almost 900 cases.
6589,It is impossible with Delta.
6590,It's too contagious.
6591,"I’m fairly sure I had COVID last Thanksgiving and got J&amp;J. I got a fairly strong immune response, had to call off work for two days."
6592,I feel pretty confident in my immunity with J&amp;J haha
6593,Expectations != what's acceptable.
6594,"If there's a school shooting, I'm going to expect that some kids are going to die."
6595,That doesn't make any of their deaths acceptable.
6596,"""Acceptable"" means ""the status quo is good enough""."
6597,"If no deaths are acceptable, that means you will always strive to improve the status quo."
6598,Zero covid deaths in children are acceptable.
6599,I'm sure they're more tired of having to beg to survive than you are having the poor unfortunate circumstance of having to see them do it.
6600,There are resources but if you look at any thread where the unhoused come up you will see why that is so much easier said than done.
6601,My state subreddit had a thread of some asshole saying how they should be bulldozing housing camps.
6602,"If these people got a job, where do they go to get ready?"
6603,Clean up?
6604,How do you hold a job when you don't know of some cop crew is going to clear your tent and the entirety of your earthly possessions?
6605,Shelters are full and kick you out.
6606,You have to wait in line to get a bed.
6607,How do you do that and work a set schedule?
6608,"The amount of barriers to getting back on your feet are staggering and that's assuming there aren't other  issues beyond control any more, whether it be substance abuse or mental health."
6609,"What you said was not only ignorant of the reality of most people's positions, it also can only come from tbe mouth of someone with privileges to never have been in that spot."
6610,Where do you live?!
6611,"When I was a senior in high school, we had to fill out a sign out/sign in sheet just to sit outside of the cafeteria 10’ away."
6612,You couldn’t just be wandering the halls during lunch
6613,Check this out and get back to me.

6615,"I mean that’s a fair point for people who aren’t able to get vaccinated and are forced to work, but for how long is that a valid reason to not do pre-pandemic things?"
6616,Covid is always going to be around and is going to be a risk for the rest of our lives.
6617,If I’m near a kid at a Red Sox game then their parents have accepted the risk of them being exposed to Covid.
6618,"Nope, and the unvaccinated ones will suffer for it."
6619,Get vaxxed.
6620,Get your family vaxxed.
6621,"And if they're not vaxxed, either don't go, eat outside or mask up."
6622,"Like their dicks are that big, please"
6623,"first of all, what the fuck is FUD?"
6624,You're making assertions with no data yet I am the scientifically illiterate one eh?
6625,lol
6626,"I mean, Detroit tried its best to die and huge chunks are indeed reclaimed by nature."
6627,But it’s still kicking.
6628,The most surprising thing to me was how many people seemingly believed them.
6629,It’s questionable but demanding a QR code that becomes available to a person after vaccination can help things.
6630,"Yes, some will try to obtain fake QR codes, but some will actually get vaccinated, as people did in the summer when they heard that it will be easier to travel (certain countries allowed vaccinated with Sputnik people to come in without quarantine or a PCR test)."
6631,Vaccinating rates were ok back then.
6632,How many of those 1000 plus educators were vaccinated?
6633,Except Vermont has case rates similar to Alabama among young people and the case rates are as high as they've ever been for adults.
6634,September was the second deadliest month of the pandemic.
6635,A lot of heads buried in the sand in NE.
6636,What fucken world is Fauci living on?
6637,I just saw football stadiums packed this past weekend.
6638,It is not like people like you had any respect for his “principles” .
6639,"Honestly, I wear a mask even being vaccinated because I have personally known several people who have gotten breakthrough cases of COVID with the vaccine, and since I am high risk, I am not willing to take on even a mild case if I can help it."

6648,Your final sentence is flagrant FUD and scientific illiteracy in action.
6649,I really want too.
6650,It was so nice to not have to run to several houses to celebrate.
6651,"Since all of us gathering are vaccinated, we can decide what we feel comfortable with."
6652,My partner is eligible for the Pfizer booster in November.
6653,Fingers crossed that moderna gets a booster approved.
6654,Russia and China have helped weaponize social media and amplify dissonance.
6655,The rich who control the Republican Party has learned that they can use this weaponization to help further their political agenda of lower taxes
6656,"&gt;  Wishing things were normal is not the same as obtaining earned normalcy

they are in all practical and material terms exactly the same thing when you're talking about how public life is being conducted--one scenario just has busier hospitals"
6657,[removed]
6658,Our kids eat outdoors and don’t talk - kind of grim but we’ve already had one classmate with COVID but no spread within the class or school so the protocols appear to work.
6659,"That could be that she's still steeped in the ""natural immunity better than vaccine immunity"" thing."
6660,Thanksgiving thru New Year's is going to keep the Grimm Reaper extra busy picking off the gatherings of the unvaxxed.
6661,how could one possibly argue that 0.1% is **highly** effective?
6662,"I agree with your sentiment I just find it odd you started talking about it being ""effective"" when the wording in question is ""highly effective"""
6663,Translation: Ifs probably unsafe but if I say so now most of y’all will travel even if you weren’t on planing to.
6664,"So I’m just gonna shut up, you should know by now if things like that are safe or not and nobody is changing their ways at this point 🤷🏼‍♂️…"
6665,"I guess, but when you are trying to get more people to get vaccines, maybe don’t put out a ridiculous quote that will have people doubling down on their hatred of him."
6666,What kinds of fines and/or jail time is she realistically going to get?
6667,"Presumably she's unemployable now and will lose her license, but how difficult is it to get reinstated or re-licensed in another state nearby?"
6668,I'm just trying to decide if it's the obvious answer (she's not too bright and not worrying about long term consequences) or something more disheartening (she knows the penalties aren't that harsh and the money she is making is worth the risk.)
6669,The most comparable vaccines against infectious viruses are the yearly suites of Influenza shots.
6670,"Flu shots are generally between 40 and 60% effective at preventing symptomatic influenza infections; give those vaccinated a 26% lower risk of hospitalization, and a 31% lower risk of dying from Influenza."
6671,"Compared to those numbers for the similarly dynamic and evolving viral threat of Covid and it's many variants, the Covid suite of Vaccines are just as effective at preventing symptomatic infections, and as of the numbers currently available, even more effective at preventing hospitalizations and deaths in those vaccinated."
6672,The problem is that people are comparing the results of Covid Vaccination to vaccines that led to the eradication of viral illnesses like Smallpox and Polio.
6673,"The people who are making that flawed comparison are ignoring the  factors that made those vaccines as effective at eradicating or nearly eradicating those specific viruses versus that of Covid and influenza vaccines that are not capable of doing the same since the viruses are radically different in morphology, epidemiological patterns,  how fast they mutate, and their ability to evade immune responses."
6674,Positive third grader here as well.
6675,"Didn't catch it at her school though, her older brother (vaccinated) brought home a breakthrough case from highschool."
6676,Thankfully she was totally asymptomatic minus the sniffles for a day.
6677,Imagine actually thinking this
6678,[removed]
6679,My understanding is that the risk of myocarditis is really only possible if the vaccine is administered intravenously (where it reaches the heart) vs in the muscle tissue (where it stays until it breaks down).
6680,"Yes, the current risk is extremely low, but perhaps it can be lowered even more with improved training and cautionary procedures?"
6681,"I'm confused why people are retaliating against an educated opinion saying that it's ""too soon to tell""?"
6682,"He didn't say ""no, people should not meet."""
6683,This is him being hopeful that people will be smart about their decisions and not giving false hope that there is no concern.
6684,Fall/winter season is prime time for flu and spreading colds and viruses.
6685,"It just became October, delta variant is still out there and spreading, many needing the booster soon, let alone many still unvaccinated."
6686,"Get vaccinated, take the precautions before meeting family, and don't hang out in other large groups 2 weeks prior to the family meeting."
6687,We all know Covid is still very much not gone.
6688,Please approve the vaccine for children FDA
6689,"Actually, this guy just died."

6691,It can happen.

6693,Sure.

6696,He should also be publicly calling out Pfizer to hurry up and submit the request for EUA for kids under 12 that was supposedly coming before the end of September.
6697,There is no moving of goalposts.
6698,"It doesn't matter what the ""original purpose"" was."
6699,"What matters is that up until Delta, a lot of the conversations, headlines, etc."
6700,clearly referenced efficacy against infection.
6701,Hell even the guidance to abandon masks originally was based exactly on this premise.
6702,"Vaccinated people weren't getting infections, they weren't spreading the virus."
6703,Delta clearly changed things.
6704,"You're being disingenuous, and not because of ""original intent""."
6705,[removed]
6706,"Okay, thank you."
6707,"My mom has had a really hard time getting appointments with other general practitioners, since her area is a bit flooded right now with cases."
6708,That's good to know about the FDA discussing mixing vaccines this month.
6709,I'm just using this as an excuse to not got to my in-laws again this year.
6710,"i can't believe that 18 months into this thing virtually no public health officials are willing to talk about ""masking"" in any but the broadest, most reductive and manichean terms."
6711,"wearing a 2 ply cloth mask is not even remotely on the same plane of efficacy as wearing an N95 or even KN95 respirator, ESPECIALLY w/r/t delta, but pointing that out is evidently anti-masker heresy"
6712,[removed]
6713,I don't.
6714,"Also, I do not think that ""grief"" is the proper term for the emotion you're feeling."
6715,You're probably obsessed with schools.
6716,It takes some special kind of stupid to go to school for whatever reason when there's a pandemic of this kind.
6717,Even more so when somebody tells you to.
6718,"&gt; Because a lot of people AREN'T vaccinated, and the ones who hold large gatherings tend to be those same people."
6719,"IF you want to hold a large gatherings for Christmas 

THEN you tend to be unvaccinated?"
6720,"Vaccinated people should hold any size of gathering they please, after 18 plus months of social distancing, mask wearing, missing birthdays and holidays."
6721,"&gt; However, Gottlieb said Americans should assess their individual situations and use tools such as Covid testing to create a safe environment."
6722,That’s an important caveat to this headline.
6723,"Honestly, I’m not sure if our extended family would even consent to testing."
6724,Of course.
6725,But let me tell you.
6726,I was vaccinated with Moderna fully in April.
6727,Right now my entire house has covid.
6728,Me and partner are fully vaxxed and completely asymptomatic.
6729,Both kids have slight fever and generally unwell.
6730,"I am so glad we did it, could have been a very different outcome."
6731,You can do this!
6732,[removed]
6733,I'm worried for all the vaccinated people in the hospital.
6734,Why aren't we going to listen to fauci
6735,And narcissistic.
6736,“I’M THE ONLY ONE WHO MATTERS!
6737,Me.
6738,MEEEEEE!”
6739,"Listen, if we are vaccinated, we are doing holidays."
6740,Statements like this just makes anti-vaxxers to believe they were right.
6741,Australia was doing very well collectively.
6742,All the states were putting out Delta as it popped up across the country.
6743,There was pretty much an agreement that it needed to stopped if possible until high vaccination rates.
6744,Pretty much every state went into snap lockdowns when a case or two appeared and snuffed out the emerging clusters.
6745,"Then it appeared in New South Wales in Sydney who had the local state government who prided itself on being ""different"" and while the premier refused for weeks to even say the word lockdown and assured everyone if they did nothing it would be fine."
6746,"It wasn't fine, got out of control inflections appeared all over the country from Sydney and into New Zealand as well."
6747,Melbourne is now dealing with a large outbreak after several clusters formed from people from Sydney.
6748,The NSW premier and deputy have just resigned after the premier is being investigated for corruption.
6749,Part of me thinks she is just running away for fucking over the entire countries collective effort to feed her own ego.
6750,I should nite there are still several states and major cities in Australia that are still covid free and have controlled Delta outbreaks.
6751,Melbourne and Sydney are going through outbreaks now.
6752,The plan is to open up when vaccination rates get into the 80+% which is in the coming weeks.
6753,Lockdowns can work but they have to be extremely early and obviously enough people need to comply.
6754,Don't even get me started on our federal government's complete failure to secure enough vaccine.
6755,Still supply issues even now.
6756,Pfizer offered 40 million doses to the Australian government mid last year which they rejected because the local pharma firm had ex-party members on the board.
6757,We should have been pretty much all vaccinated by the time Delta arrived but had barely started.
6758,[removed]
6759,"""I only care when it happens to me"""
6760,"The Israeli data could be skewed because it excludes asymptomatic or milder infections, and there’s also the question about how immunity is measured, because some tests are looking at things like antibody titers against spike protein where vaccines look more effective but there could be antibodies against other viral epitopes that weren’t measured."
6761,Yes because I have a child that is not yet eligible for her vaccine
6762,My prayer 🙏 to the family
6763,"Yeah, no lol."
6764,"I'm fully vaccinated, as is all my family members."
6765,"We're gathering to meet, just like we've been doing since we all got vaxxed."
6766,He's nuts if he thinks anyone is taking his advice anymore
6767,Updated post.
6768,I started looking at case numbers again when Delta started raging.
6769,I started wearing masks again.
6770,I cancelled the first plans I made for large gathering events since lockdown began in March of 2020.
6771,I'm fully vaccinated but I don't like to take unnecessary risks.
6772,"I'm visiting my friends and family again, but I'm still cautious about large gatherings."
6773,I'm watching as the peak drops off.
6774,I'll be more comfortable about holiday plans after I get my booster shot and if those numbers stay down.
6775,Best case scenario: Delta was COVID's last ditch effort and we're over it now.
6776,"But, like Fauci says, it's too soon to tell."
6777,"Awesome, the virus is doing a good job!"
6778,"Well it depends if you and loved ones are already vaccinated is ok , but if you have family who expend their entire day watching Fox news, wear red caps and could possibly be involved In an insurrection/ coup attempt."
6779,You may want to hold on before you invite them over.
6780,That is if they are able to travel by then or are already in a hospital ward.
6781,I'm also worried that my anti-vaxxer friends will see news like this as yet another reason not to have their children vaccinated.
6782,"Not that they were going to anyway, but now they can shake ""your beloved New York Times says so!"""
6783,in my face.
6784,That's not risk aversion.
6785,Lots of people did all of those things.
6786,Then they got vaccinated.
6787,The risk of death and hospitalization is now low.
6788,Most people aren't worried about getting sick for a while.
6789,At this point I don't know anyone who is unaware that you can be infected after vaccination.
6790,Most people just don't care.
6791,The risk of being sick for a few days does not outweigh the desire to do things.
6792,It seems you don't understand how basically everyone in the country thinks about this.
6793,Because the whole country is entirely open lol.
6794,There’s no reason to even contemplate gathering with family at this point

6817,Don't take this as being against vaccination or saying that it's pointless.
6818,I'm only trying to make sure we have and are spreading realistic expectations.

6827,And we can do it by people getting vaccinated and also in the situation where boosters are appropriate to get people boosted.”
6828,"&gt;millions of people who have gotten reinfected with the Delta variant and they've either died or had worse reactions

uh i think we're gonna need some kinda citation for this one"
6829,Gee I wonder why vaccine hesitant people aren’t changing their minds?
6830,Maybe because you have “experts” saying out of touch garbage like this.
6831,"It should be simply “if you’re vaccinated, enjoy the holidays, if not, you know the risks by now.” I feel bad for anyone who still listens to what this guy says and is going to end up doing zoom Christmas again with their fully vaccinated family in the name of “trusting the science”"
6832,What a joke
6833,If you vaccinated sure why not
6834,Yeah I’m getting tired of this.
6835,"I’m vaccinated, I’ll get my booster when I’m able, all of my family that wants the vaccine has gotten it."
6836,I’m seeing them.
6837,We can’t keep doing this.
6838,It’s been almost two years.
6839,He's being justifiably cautious given how many times he's been attacked after the situation changed and his position changed with it (as it should).
6840,"What if there's a new, highly vaccine-resistant variant running rampant by Christmas?"
6841,"""Too soon to tell"" isn't telling people ""no,"" it's just trying not to be boxed in by a premature statement."
6842,"If circumstances remain similar to what they are know, I'm sure he'll be okay with vaccinated people traveling for Christmas, but will probably urge some extra caution with young kids who can't be vaccinated yet."

6887,"absolutely, pretty much my experience as well."
6888,"i know a very small minority of people who, while still vaccinated, won't do things like come over for dinner, only socialize outdoors, run or jog in masks, etc."
6889,i feel like this group of people is simultaneously the only ones who will take admonitions against family gatherings seriously while also being the ones who need to hear + act on them the least.
6890,"these are the same people, incidentally, who absolutely do not want to hear about how much the science has changed in the past \~5 months: your cloth mask is only slightly better than wearing nothing at all, and the ""6ft of distance"" thing is pretty well completely meaningless in the face of an aerosolized virus"
6891,"One year from now you’ll be saying “it still sucks, but it’s better than 2021, and if we just keep trying, maybe 2022 will be a normal holiday season”"
6892,not every other country failed though.
6893,china is maintaining zero covid.
6894,Same here in Florida.
6895,And I take Covid seriously.
6896,My best friend died of Covid.
6897,I’m traumatized.
6898,But now my family and most friends are vaccinated except the littles.
6899,Life is back to normal.
6900,We are starting gymnastics (with precautions).
6901,We go out.
6902,I went to Halloween horror nights (with a mask) and has a blast.
6903,It’s time to move forward.
6904,I can’t be trapped in my house anymore.
6905,I got Covid last year and was sick for months and spent so much time alone in my house.
6906,I can’t do that again.
6907,I was worried about them getting covid and getting through it once they did I never really thought about the long term side effects they would go through.
6908,No one knows the extent or how long it will last or if things will surface later.
6909,I  know we were very lucky and that’s heart breaking to see not everyone come out of this with only brain fog but can’t imagine being a 7 year old trying to learn to read and write and you have brain fog and can barely hold a conversation at times.
6910,[removed]
6911,That number while good is skewed.
6912,The biggest increases from May-Sept and been in the south.
6913,"As we know its hot and people go inside, so the numbers were higher."
6914,"We are in that sweet middle ground where more people can be distanced and outside, it will have a rapid increase as it cools and more northern folk go inside."
6915,"Compliance is non-existent in Somerville restaurants, though many Cambridge restaurants are still strictly enforcing."
6916,People already questioned the purpose of making indoor diners wear masks for the first 5-10 minutes they were there.
6917,Now even people in the most progressive parts of Greater Boston are done with this rule for restaurants.
6918,"I went to Lucky Strike (for non-locals, this is a bar, bowling alley, and arcade)."
6919,"No one was wearing masks, even if they didn’t have a drink."
6920,Enforcement was non-existent once you passed the bouncer.
6921,"Medford has a mask mandate, but I have seen almost 0 compliance across the board."
6922,"Even the staff at gyms, restaurants, barbers, etc are not wearing them, and they’re doing that in plain view of the street where anyone can see."
6923,"People are clearly done with the mandates, patrons and business owners included."
6924,Compliance is tanking outside of hospitals and grocery stores.
6925,"The vaccination rates in these cities are very high, and people are fed up."
6926,"It's really unbelievable how common it is to cite statistics like this and things like ""only 0.001% of vaccinated people have died from Covid."""
6927,"Even the CDC and state health governments are guilty of pushing statistics like these, which sound good but are basically meaningless."
6928,"It feels especially shady because unlike journalists, these people presumably understand basic statistics and know that these numbers have little substance, but choose to push them anyways because they sound good."
6929,IMO it's ultimately counterproductive because it fuels antivax conspiracy theories that the CDC is maliciously manipulating the narrative.
6930,Especially in Boston.

6950,"&gt; acting as if nothing is going on

There's your problem right there."
6951,Wishing things were normal is not the same as obtaining earned normalcy.

6960,"That’s fine, but I also define permanent brain fog as a serious illness but the CDC does not."
6961,"Plus, transmissibility is based on infection, not serious illness or death."
6962,So I still consider it important for the end goal of preventing serious illness.
6963,"You can repeat their talking points all you want and I understand the intentions behind it, but completely disregarding infection rate as an input to the probability of serious illness by any reasonable person’s definition is negligent at best."
6964,"I had an anti-vax acquaintance recently tell me ""covid hasn't killed any kids""."
6965,"When I pointed out that's not true and that a small number have been killed, she pivoted to ""well okay, but it was only a small number, and they all had co-morbidities""."
6966,"Basically that's saying ""oh, those kids were kinda sick already, so they don't count""."
6967,Fucking sickening!
6968,They were human beings.
6969,Little vulnerable humans just starting their lives at that!

6976,Biden's no better than Trump in this regard.
6977,"Sorry if this comment is ""political"" but it's also reality."
6978,"Kids are dying &amp; developing lifelong complications &amp; people are acting like it's time to take off the masks &amp; go to football games, homecoming, parent-teacher conferences, etc."
6979,"All of those kids are in school, which is mandated by the state and mandated to be in person in a lot of places."
6980,"""Little Suzy, you have to go see 1000 kids at school every day, but you can't see Grandma and Grandpa because Big Tony says so""."
6981,I don't see the logic.
6982,"Not only that, but (at least in the United States) there are plenty of people that will intentionally make a point to set up and attend a large family outing just out of spite to do the exact opposite of what Fauci and the CDC says."
6983,I wish I was kidding.
6984,lol fuckin exactly.
6985,"100K people can pack in shoulder to shoulder to watch football, but don't get within 6ft of grandma"
6986,74 countries have deaths per million over a thousand.
6987,"NZ has 5/1,000,000 for a grand total of 27 deaths."
6988,There are probably a bunch of things that could have been done better depending on viewpoints.
6989,There always is.
6990,But 27 deaths and bugger all lockdowns compared to the rest of the world is still going to be a medal performance.
6991,"Can they catch a decent death rate of, say, 5000 total to equal the sort of average country?"
6992,I doubt it.
6993,For most of the negative opinions regarding NZ situation the above pretty much nullifies them; I think as lives are actually pretty important and living without lockdowns would have been nice too.
6994,For most of the other opinions regarding transparency etc just look at how well that has worked for other countries (with or without transparancy).
6995,Basically individual humans seem to be pretty shit at following the rules which save other people if that individual -really- wants to do something which is against the rules.
6996,"Tell people ""you don't need a mask"" and omit the ""because you're not important enough; we only have enough for medical people"" and you get that thrown in your face forever as not knowing anything."
6997,Tell the truth at the time?
6998,hah.
6999,"Tell people ""wear a mask"" and they get pissy because of their own desire to make a choice."
7000,No government had a snowball in hell's chance of getting it right.
7001,Some just did better for longer.
7002,West Australia has closed borders and 3 cases yesterday so everyone wants to open up the borders.
7003,The UK made a chance at using all the vaccines and not holding back for second doses.
7004,Australia made a chance at making them locally.
7005,"One got lucky, one got shafted."
7006,Could have gone the other way; there was no fact basis to work on really.
7007,It's easy to sit on the sidelines and criticise I guess.
7008,"Okay, I'm misinformed."
7009,I have one question.
7010,"You're American and I'm Canadian, so I assume you guys have a similar rule."
7011,"When you enroll a child into school, they require proof of vaccination, and without it you're not admitted."
7012,Draconian mandate?
7013,And the number of healthcare workers and PhDs that are doing this are a small percentage of the total of healthcare workers + PhDs.
7014,"Most of them are nurses or medical staff, not real doctors."
7015,"And this is why the scientific method requires a consensus on things and multiple studies verifying the same hypothesis, cuz it doesn't trust any single scientist, doctor, etc to be the single source of truth."
7016,"There are even studies showing how the soul leaves the body on death, and the reason they're not trusted is because their method was completely flawed (I've read a couple of papers)."
7017,This is basically what you get when someone just passes the fucking exams and goes on to become a doctor/engineer without really grasping the concepts.
7018,uh... no.
7019,"i live in the midwest and have generally been living a normal life since vaccine #2, will go and get my booster next week."
7020,"Ohio handled things pretty shittily all things concerned, but the overwhelming majority of people out here are pretty much acting as if nothing is going on, and it's not a ""reward for good behavior"" by any means."
7021,"There’s also a problem of vaccines being improperly administered on a mass scale, the WHO literally recommends not aspirating the shot as that’s the only way to guarantee Intramuscular injection vs intravenous injection, which is what the manufacturers explicitly recommend for administering the vaccines and can cause acute myocarditis or pericarditis which is very dangerous to those with heart conditions."
7022,We also don’t know what kind of long term neurological effects these vaccines may pose and people are being told that such effects would have appeared by now even though the SPARS pandemic simulation through John Hopkins Institute in 2017 page 60-61 explicitly predicted neurological side effects potentially showing up 2-4 years later from vaccination.
7023,Am I suppose to believe that these scientists and experts who conducted this simulation 4-5 years ago were misinformed?
7024,Didn’t know what they are talking about?
7025,"We 100% do, but I think people are overestimating how many parents are going to rush out to get their young kids vaccinated."
7026,What do we do if only 25-50% of kids end up getting vaccinated?
7027,"I said it in a comment above, but I only know 2 families who are still keeping their young kids home."
7028,"All the other parents I know are taking their kids on vacations, letting them hang out with their friends all the time etc."
7029,"My co-worker has a 7 year old who hasn’t done anything except go to school since this all started, she lives in a MA town who has some of the most strict pandemic precautions."
7030,"She said he gets upset with her all the time because, this school year especially, his friends at school are always talking about all the fun things they’re doing with their friends/sports, going out etc."
7031,while he’s not allowed to go anywhere on the weekends.
7032,"I only use this as an example because, from what I see around me, even a lot of parents with unvaccinated kids are resuming normal life."
7033,Go thru what process?
7034,The cohort study included only double vaccinated Pf and Moderna CMS patients.
7035,~2.7m Moderna
7036,"This, exactly!"
7037,"I may gather with my family ( in town ) because I know their vaccination status, but I won't be planning an indoor Xmas party for my Boy Scout Troop and all their families."

7052,&gt;	What did we get vaccinated for if we can’t be around other vaccinated people?
7053,"Hang on, lemme go ask Delta if it’ll leave and give us back Alpha so we can—wait…hang on—okay Delta says “no”, it’s gonna stick around for a bit."
7054,Circumstances change.

7145,whoa there - we cannot say there is effectively zero risk for the vaccine for kids.
7146,We don't know what if any impact X dosage would have on an elementary school aged child
7147,They're trying to obfuscate the waning effectiveness of the vaccines.
7148,"That's when they started using all these weird, misleading stats, when concerns about waning effectiveness started coming up."
7149,Need to just admit it should have been a 3 shot protocol to begin with and get everyone a booster.
7150,Easy: The speed limit should be raised to whatever the current wink wink nudge nudge limit is and then it should be enforced at that limit.
7151,EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE
7152,I was the same as you - wanting to hold off for a few months on vaccinating my 5 yr old once it was available and then my unvaccinated father in law died in September.
7153,My child will be vaccinated asap.

7217,"But if we brought it from school, my kids wouldn't understand that."

&gt;Russia’s top cabinet official on Monday criticized the country's stalling vaccination rates for failing to slow the spread of Covid-19 as Russians die in numbers not seen since the start of the pandemic."
7248,Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said health officials have made it easy for people across the country’s 11 time zones to get the Covid jab and medication.
7249,"“But the **vaccination level is insufficient to stop the spread of infection**,” Mishustin said during a Covid task force meeting."
7250,He added that the government is “seriously concerned” about the spike in infections.
7251,“**Morbidity is increasing in most Russian regions.
7252,"There are twice as many patients in hospitals as there were at the same time last year**,” Mishustin said."
7253,"Russia has approved at least five Covid-19 vaccines, all of which were developed domestically."
7254,"But its vaccination drive has stalled at 36% of the adult population, according to the independent Gogov monitor that gathers regional data."
7255,"Russia has reported **record high numbers of coronavirus deaths for five out of the past six days**, with its all-time record of 890 Covid-19 fatalities reported Sunday."
7256,"On Monday, the government tally reported the third-highest number of daily Covid cases since the start of 2021."
7257,"In Moscow, the epicenter of the pandemic within Russia, Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said **infections have risen by 30% and hospitalizations by 20% in the past week alone."
7258,"**  
Anxiety over the resurgent virus was on display when news agencies covering Monday’s task force meeting initially reported that officials canceled all mass events in Russia."
7259,"Rospotrebnadzor, the consumer-protection watchdog that oversees the national coronavirus response effort, said later that the ban on gatherings of more than 3,000 people was already in place across all 85 Russian regions."
7260,"The Kremlin has urged regional leaders to take steps to slow the spread, stopping short of **indicating that it was planning to reimpose national-level restrictions."
7261,"**  


Low level of vaccination."
7262,Already on levels of daily new cases seen during the peak 6 months ago.
7263,Setting new records of daily deaths.
7264,New restrictions coming.
7265,[removed]
7266,Then say if everyone is vaccinated it is absolutely safe and people should be making plans for a great holiday!
7267,"If you aren't vaccinated if recommend not going, but I understand most people still will, so try to increase ventilation if you can."
7268,"Then move on because all he does now is piss everyone off, vaccinated or not."
7269,That is not a certainty unless you make them mandatory.
7270,"With people being this stubborn, Covid might turn out to be just as unkillable as the flu."
7271,You poor person :(  I hope it comes back for you.
7272,"This is suchhhh over exaggeration, permanent Brain fog!"
7273,"Sure, maybe in like 5% to 1%?"
7274,This is a reality that we will probably not be able to make a neutralizing vaccine.
7275,"Most of our vaccines we have are for illnesses That don’t mutate, the flu vaccine isn’t extremely effective because it mutates, much like coronaviruses, though much more slowly."
7276,"We can’t have antibodies permanently in our bodies, it would turn out blood to sludge."
7277,All that really matters is T-cells ability o remember and make new antibodies.
7278,"The truth is, we will all eventually get Covid."
7279,[removed]
7280,"What messaging, tho?"
7281,"Current guidelines haven’t changed, nor has Fauci contradicted them."
7282,… ??
7283,"From the article:

&gt; “We’ve just got to concentrate on continuing to get those numbers down and not try to jump ahead by weeks or months and say what we’re going to do at a particular time,” Fauci told *Face the Nation*."
7284,“Let’s focus like a laser on continuing to get those cases down.
7285,"And we can do it by people getting vaccinated and also in the situation where boosters are appropriate to get people boosted.”

Like, that’s legit good advice, imho."
7286,"And on child enrollment as a parent you have the right to home school your child, fundamentally different from requiring vaccination to engage in all aspects of society, particularly traveling across the country."
7287,And my whole point is requiring testing and masks that actually work is more effective than the false security people are being fed from being vaccinated.
7288,Besides you’re comparing vaccines from diseases with extremely high morbidity and decades of research on their potential side effects vs an extremely young vaccine with only short term effectiveness for a disease that so far  has shown very specific risk factors for hospitalization.
7289,"It’s not a fair comparison, we don’t require kids to show proof of vaccination when traveling or entering a store and there are clear, accessible alternatives to public schooling"
7290,"The data is in, and the sooner the kids get vaccines the better off we'll be."
7291,Why don't they have this meeting right now?
7292,I’m not sure what we will be doing for Christmas.
7293,I have a 1 year old that I highly doubt will be able to be vaccinated by then.
7294,I also have a 5 year old nephew who is in school.
7295,Right now they are the only unvaccinated family members.
7296,I really hope the 5-11 group is able to get vaccinated soon!
7297,"It was awful not getting together last year, but I didn’t want to risk it with my then-3 month old."
7298,"That being said- if it wasn’t for my kid, it would be business as usual over here."
7299,I’m pretty sure most people are either vaccinated or DGAF anyways.
7300,People have made their minds up.
7301,Just waiting on the kiddos…
7302,"tbh, great business opportunity... explains why QVC and other teleshopping businesses are still in business, as well as MLMs."
7303,I think you misunderstood what I was saying.
7304,I am going to an event by choice that I purchased a ticket for.
7305,Everyone else going to the event is going by choice as well (its a performance).
7306,"The event is requiring everyone to be fully vaccinated, show proof of vaccination, no one under 12 is allowed in, and we still all have to wear masks at all times once inside the building."
7307,The masking part was not made aware to people buying tickets until after tickets were sold.
7308,I was using my profession as an example of how this type of thing isn't happening anywhere in private events.
7309,"You're right, my aunt's cousin's friend's dog said he got COVID and he only lost 50% lung capacity and he can almost taste his Marlboros again."
7310,All the world's leading scientists are just liars and grifters.
7311,About 90% of adults have some protection (fully vaxxed or natural infection) and soon most under 12 will be eligible for the vaccine.
7312,It's hard to imagine another major wave.
7313,"Maybe a small one around the holidays, but probably not another large one."
7314,[removed]
7315,It's extremely sad.
7316,It's also unfair that adults refuse a preventative treatment that have resulted in medical staff having to make these decisions.
7317,It's unfair that people have died unrelated to Covid19 because the ICU and ER were full of unvaccinated individuals.
7318,It got so bad in Florida that they nearly ran out of oxygen in the hospitals.
7319,Hospital resources are finite and unfortunately we're at the point where we need to be conservative with their care.

Fauci wants families fully vaccinated and safe, especially if they’re traveling."
7361,"That’s kinda the entire point, fwiw."

7370,We're 2.5x that today.
7371,"Without a significant increase in vaccinations and/or precautions, it is most likely to get worse in winter."

High blood pressure

Asthma

Diabetes (all types)

7557,That’s more what I was asking about.
7558,Thanks so much!
7559,I agree with this.
7560,"The absolutist view of ""people will gather"" is wrong."
7561,* Some people will gather.
7562,* Some people will gather in smaller groups.
7563,* Some people will not gather.
7564,"""Not everyone will follow advice, therefore there is no point in offering advice"" is an understandable point of view given how badly the American people have performed during the pandemic; but it's not accurate."

7595,"For example, last week it was reported the largest hospital in Montana was at 150% capacity."
7596,"For a rural state like Montana, that's a huge problem because that major hospital is the overflow for all of the little rural hospitals."
7597,"&amp;#x200B;

Most of the US is seeing higher case counts and deaths than they did this time last year."
7598,The vaccine only works if people take it.
7599,Wearing a mask is not normal though.

7620,I know that vaccines work.
7621,"But if you live in a highly vaccinated area, do you want Fauci to encourage holiday travel, bringing lots of unvaccinated people into your area?"
7622,The point of discouraging holiday travel is to contain the outbreaks.
7623,There's no solid data on mild to moderate breakthrough cases is there?
7624,"The last I read, the CDC hadn't released that."
7625,&gt;From a selfless perspective this means fewer overall deaths.
7626,From a more selfish perspective it means fewer mutations in the virus which would ultimately benefit all of us in the long run.
7627,There was a paper (authors were actually on the podcast as well) that confirmed this on this week in virology (don't have the actual episode handy) using modeling.
7628,"The problem is, people are so short sighted and selfish that if you actually were straight up and said ""look, a booster will help you in the short run, but helps ALL of us more in the longer run"" people would probably go for it anyways (except the antivaxxers who, of course would say SEEE!"
7629,IT DOESN'T WORK LIEEESSSSSS!).
7630,Overall given the choices...
7631,"I'm ok going this route, though I'm also fairly sure I'm going to get a booster as soon as they're approved (moderna)."
7632,[removed]
7633,I’d read that.
7634,It all depends on how much opportunity we give the virus to mutate.
7635,“emergence of escape mutants is somewhat less likely for the Delta variant than for the wild type… the small set of escape-enhancing mutations already identified for the wild type is likely to include the majority of all possible mutations with this effect.”
7636,It's not stupidity it's not wanting to admit facts that contradict her delusions or to contradict the cult.
7637,I had a co-worker (blatant Trump cultist science denier) whose mother got covid.
7638,"Was hospitalized for like 2 months, almost died repeatedly and had to be re-admitted several times."
7639,"A week after she was out of the hospital was claiming his mother didn't get Covid but ""got that double pneumonia""."
7640,These people view admitting facts to be a betrayal of their cult.

7642,"Yeah kid most likely took off his masks, not blaming them though."

7648,Smh.
7649,The scientific data says that if you’re state has it shit together and got vaccinated your hospitalizations aren’t in danger of overwhelming the healthcare system.
7650,Though I’m sure once the whole country is good the goalpost will be moved to citing how the pandemic is still bad in other countries so therefore we can’t resume normalcy.
7651,And they should.
7652,Two years is too long.

7682,"Given how quickly the situation can evolve it's absolutely prudent to say, ""we don't know, Thanksgiving is 52 days out and Christmas is  82 days away."
7683,"We will know more as we get closer to those dates."""
7684,I would be shocked and alarmed if he gave any specific guidance _in either_ direction this early.

7686,"Well, remember that part where you were saying you just needed someone to hold your hand because you thought were going to die and couldn't breathe?"
7687,So not getting the vaccine - that's what it looks like.
7688,You should have all the information you need after nearly dying.

7703,One pregnant woman wore her own mask and literally no one else did.

7705,People are done with masks.

7711,Just get your third shot and take care of yourself man.
7712,Personal spoiler: it's not worth the aggravation to gather for holidays.

7714,"Oh well, not reading the actual article, it's a tradition as old as the internet."
7715,I hope your coworker gets well soon  :(
7716,This fucking guy
7717,"My extended family is all vaccinated (unless under 12), we live on the Left coast, and there was zero talk of covid with our thanksgiving plan discussion."

7725,This lady is infuriating.
7726,"Getting vaccinated isn't a personal choice, it has on an impact on everyone."
7727,"By not getting vaccinated she not only is showing a level of selfishness that's pure narcissisms, but she's also showing how little she cares for anyone, not even herself."
7728,It's people like this that are a drag on society and they are going to be the end of us.

7730,So is she going to do replicate the extensive lab work that has already been done?
7731,Is that what she means by research?
7732,Or does she mean she needs to read a few more FB posts from idiots in her toxic echo chamber?
7733,I think we all know what she means.
7734,I'm really interested to see what will happen this winter.
7735,"Now that so many people (in first world nations anyway) are either vaccinated or have previously gotten infected, I'm hoping that even cold and flu season won't cause a big spike in hospitalizations/deaths like we saw last winter."
7736,Hopefully the Aug-Sep-Oct wave is the last big one.
7737,"&gt; -Virtual Thanksgiving and Christmas again

lol no"
7738,This idea keeps popping up on Reddit based on some older research paper but to me it doesn't seem to account for the fact that the problem predominantly affects men nor does it explain why the problem is almost exclusively after the second dose.
7739,Maybe men are more susceptible but why after dose 2?
7740,Is only the second dose being injected improperly?
7741,Is it the first dose?
7742,Both?

7754,"&gt;As we see here, once your community transmission gets passed a certain threshold, you've lost the Zero COVID game."
7755,Not really.
7756,We just lock down for a few weeks and try again.
7757,Maybe in certain regions it would not be feasible but it's wild to me that nobody even bothered to try.
7758,It seems pretty clear that COVID zero was a great strategy for the original strain but now Delta has made it too difficult to pursue.

7777,I'm not a hermit either.

7782,But a movie theater with hundreds of people?
7783,Anyone of them could be a covid idiot and get me a least a breakthrough case.

7816,The vax is available to anyone who wants it in the US and almost all developed countries so I am not going to keep my life on hold in order to protect those that don't want protection.
7817,"I am not a big supporter of capitalism, but I think you are missing the fact that goods and services still exist under any economic system."
7818,People need to work in order for there to be food to eat and electricity and plumbing in people's houses regardless of who owns the means of production.
7819,"I recommend that you give up hope for this global lockdown because a) it would not end covid, because covid still exists in countries like Australia and new Zealand which once eradicated it, and b) it is an extremely miniscule percentage of the population that would support such a thing."

7903,I didn't have much of a reaction to the first two..just some injection site soreness.
7904,The booster (at 8 months) knocked me out.
7905,I had massive lethargy for two days and couldn't put weight on my arm.
7906,All was clear by day three.
7907,I also didn't see a single mention of at-home rapid tests!
7908,Do they think Americans aren't capable of knowing how to use them to minimize risk before gathering (despite FDA EUA)?
7909,"This CDC messaging makes me laugh/cry, as a vaccinated immunologist who took COVID precautions so seriously throughout."
7910,Definitely hanging with my 70 year old parents this holiday season (after they get boosters and I do a rapid test at minimum).
7911,"Their completely out of touch messaging will make people turn away, and perhaps instead to misinformation."
7912,"Let's do some quick math to see where we're at:

330 million people live in America."
7913,"60%, or 198 million have been vaccinated."
7914,An additional 43.6 million Americans have had the virus already.
7915,330 - 198 - 43.6 = 88.4 million Americans with no antibodies to the virus at all.
7916,"All of this is making some huge assumptions:

1) that everyone has achieved immunity from either the vaccine or natural immunity, and it won't wane after a few months."
7917,"2) that there's no overlap in the people who have had the virus and those who've been vaccinated, even though we know there are."
7918,We just don't know how many.
7919,3) that we have an accurate count of actual COVID cases.
7920,"4) that we're still going to be dealing with the same delta variant, and not delta plus, or some other strain

But for arguments sake, let's pretend that there are really 88.4 million susceptible Americans."
7921,"We saw 3 COVID waves in 2020: April/May, a second in July/August and a third December/January."
7922,"By far, the December/January peak was the worst."
7923,"In 2021 we've seen a wave in April/May, and a big one in July/August/September."
7924,"Bottom line: we still have tens of millions of Americans with no immunity and if the pattern keeps repeating, we're in for a massive COVID wave through Christmas and New Year's."
7925,Fauci doesn't want to break bad news because America has a penchant for shooting the messenger.
7926,But it absolutely will not be safe to gather for Christmas.

7953,At a certain point we have to just live with Covid.
7954,That's the spirit!
7955,&gt;What did we get vaccinated for if we can't be around other vaccinated people?
7956,That was the only reason to get vaccinated.
7957,"So I am happily interacting with vaccinated people, and, I'll even go to public places where unvaccinated people are."
7958,"I’m surrounded by states that are doing very well, even if you haven’t heard of them (IE, journalists make more money writing stories about states doing bad than states doing good)."

8053,This.
8054,And also there do exist plenty of other deleterious long-term outcomes other than death which people—including the vaccinated—would do well to avoid.
8055,&gt;I don't want to get a breakthrough case.
8056,Good luck with that.
8057,Covid is endemic.
8058,I live in a country with 90% vaccination rate for everyone over 12 and we have breakthrough cases.

8067,"It seems to have the capability to bypass previous infection immunity, vaccine immunity evading, it is more infectious, while at the same time more deadly but keeping the same week and a half 2 weeks incubation time."
8068,"The saving grace so far is that it does not appear to be out competing Delta, which is far more infectious and can spread more easily than any other variant to date."
8069,This is such a bad conspiracy.
8070,How do you explain places like New Zealand where they had virtually no covid cases *or* flu cases for a year?
8071,Most of their covid cases were outside of a normal flu season also.
8072,"The claim that the flu is still happening but its all being tagged as covid deaths is a fantasy, not something based on facts."
8073,We still test for the flu and there have been cases (just very few).
8074,The flu and covid don't even share all the same symptoms.
8075,Covid is distinct.
8076,"And I bet of the 4% that don't have a valid medical or religious excuse, most of them are insufferable coworkers, bad teachers, or both, and can be replaced by someone who gives a damn."

8079,"A lot of people still feel that way, I have no idea if he forgot the /s or not."
8080,"My main real-life COVID stress isn't unvaccinated people, because I really don't know any, it's the the social tension of vaccinated people having different risk tolerances."
8081,"The judging about people going to the movies, or restararunats, or whatever."
8082,There are some people who will just never do anything again.
8083,But I've long stopped sacrificing my mental health for the physical health of the unvaccinated.
8084,"The last complication is other peoples' kids, and I haven't quite figured out how to balance that."
8085,"I'm certainly happy to wear a mask or make whatever accommodations, but, I'm not deferring to the most cautious people I know's activity level either."
8086,&gt; If everybody was vaccinated the pandemic would be largely over in the US.
8087,But it’s still SO BAD.
8088,Is it?
8089,[removed]
8090,"At this point, I'm of the opinion that mild to moderate breakthrough cases are pretty common."
8091,I also suspect that mild to moderate long haul symptoms are also common.
8092,Fairly sure I have them.
8093,"Nevertheless, I am vaxed and try to convince others to do so."
8094,"In a roundabout way, for a vaxed person, Covid really isn't all that much different from the flu (I'm echoing the original bullshit from pre-vax days here) although it is more contagious."
8095,Both can put you in the hospital in rare cases and both can kill you in rarer cases.
8096,"And still, due to the risks that remain, I remain cautious."
8097,Which sucks because I just decided not to go to an indoor concert that I had tickets for.
8098,"Lots of indoor events going on this year, I wish we had a better understanding of the fallout from that, and schools of course."
8099,All we know about are the unvaxed and severe breakthrough cases.
8100,The whole risk equation is getting pretty complicated for those of us living in post-vax pandemic times.
8101,It's easy to blame messaging but I think in many cases the bigger problem is poor science literacy and rampant misinformation.
8102,There's only so much you can do with messaging if the situation is uncertain and rapidly changing.

8105,&gt; Myself and fully vaccinated family will 100% be gathering for holidays this year.
8106,Even if the daily new case rate jumps to 200/100k with the vaccinated constituting 50% of new infections?
8107,I'm guessing probably not.
8108,That's why the experts are saying it's too early to offer guidance at this point.
8109,"It's also why making such bold, declarative statements is dangerous."
8110,"Now, is this likely to happen?"
8111,Absolutely not.
8112,But could a new variant of concern—which is not impeded by the existing vaccines—emerge between now and then?
8113,Absolutely.
8114,You and your family would be better served by continuing to listen to the experts rather than being so rigid.
8115,How much responsibility does the Trump administration have for the failure of reducing death and infections from covid?
8116,&gt; It's like they don't have the imagination to even envision how the immune system or a virus even works.
8117,I will never be able to understand how their brains see the world.
8118,They just can't admit fault or take responsibility for their actions.

8300,Yes ... it less effective ... but not ineffective.
8301,"&gt;**BACKGROUND**  
&gt;The B.1.617.2 (delta) variant of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), has contributed to a surge in cases in India and has now been detected across the globe, including a notable increase in cases in the United Kingdom."
8302,The effectiveness of the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccines against this variant has been unclear.
8303,"&gt;    
&gt;**METHODS**  
&gt;We used a test-negative case–control design to estimate the effectiveness of vaccination against symptomatic disease caused by the delta variant or the predominant strain (B.1.1.7, or alpha variant) over the period that the delta variant began circulating."
8304,Variants were identified with the use of sequencing and on the basis of the spike (S) gene status.
8305,Data on all symptomatic sequenced cases of Covid-19 in England were used to estimate the proportion of cases with either variant according to the patients’ vaccination status.
8306,"&gt;  
&gt;**RESULTS**  
&gt;Effectiveness after one dose of vaccine (BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) was notably lower among persons with the delta variant (30.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 25.2 to 35.7) than among those with the alpha variant (48.7%; 95% CI, 45.5 to 51.7); the results were similar for both vaccines."
8307,"With the BNT162b2 vaccine, the effectiveness of two doses was 93.7% (95% CI, 91.6 to 95.3) among persons with the alpha variant and 88.0% (95% CI, 85.3 to 90.1) among those with the delta variant."
8308,"With the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, the effectiveness of two doses was 74.5% (95% CI, 68.4 to 79.4) among persons with the alpha variant and 67.0% (95% CI, 61.3 to 71.8) among those with the delta variant."
8309,"&gt;  
&gt;**CONCLUSIONS**  
&gt;Only modest differences in vaccine effectiveness were noted with the delta variant as compared with the alpha variant after the receipt of two vaccine doses."
8310,Absolute differences in vaccine effectiveness were more marked after the receipt of the first dose.
8311,This finding would support efforts to maximize vaccine uptake with two doses among vulnerable populations.

8314,"( https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines-work/effectiveness-studies.htm )

Even more importantly, 
&gt; Even though vaccines offer different ranges of protection, real-world evaluations show they still provide robust protection against hospitalization at 60 to 95 percent."

Edit: dunno about brand, any recommendation?"
8352,"&gt;I fail to understand how a relatively rich country like the US has such a high death count, whereas countries like India and the entire continent of Africa, have much lower death counts (yes, even after accounting for government undercounting in India by a factor of 10)."
8353,"&gt;  
&gt;Can someone help me understand this?"
8354,"&amp;#x200B;

There are dozens of factors that lead the US to have larger official counts than the nation of India, and the entire continent of Africa, here are just a few:

1."
8355,The US likely records and keeps track of such data throughout it's territory far better than the health systems and institutions of India which have a hard time getting detailed information from more remote and poorer regions of their nation.
8356,That helps contribute to India's under-reporting issues.
8357,2.
8358,"If we go by India's numbers on [Worldometers](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries), they have about 450,000 deaths."
8359,"If they are undercounting by a factor of 10, their total death count is 4.5 million, over six times as many as the US
3."
8360,"Africa is an entire continent composed of dozens of nations, each with different amounts of resources that could be used to respond to and keep track of this pandemic."
8361,Many of those nations are highly impoverished and suffer from internal as well as external conflicts that compounds the difficulty of responding to this pandemic and keeping good records if it's impact especially in more remote and unstable territories.
8362,"Many parts of the African continent also have to contend with not only this pandemic, but a large variety of other infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS, Malaria, Dengue, periodic outbreaks of Ebola and Marburg, Polio still, and hundreds of other pathogenic diseases not to mention societal factors like malnutrition, extreme poverty, densely populated urban centers that lack access to hygienic water and other supplies."
8363,4.
8364,Culture in the US.
8365,"Before this pandemic, it was not uncommon at all- in fact, it was the norm- for workers to go into work sick as long as they could get out bed and out of the house."
8366,"Many people couldn't afford to take sick days, and many workers feared losing future hours if they used such a sick day."
8367,"A lot of these workers worked in professions most conducive to spreading infectious diseases like point-of-sale jobs like servers, back-of-house jobs like cooks, and everything retail."
8368,5.
8369,"The first major outbreaks of Covid in the US like in the NYC metro area in the spring of 2020 hit so hard and so fast that by the time the CDC confirmed community transmission was occurring, thousands of people were already infected and incubating the virus."
8370,"That's why it took little over a week and a half between one man from Westchester being the first suspected then confirmed case of community transmission, to hospitals in NYC and it's surrounding metro areas being overwhelmed with critical cases streaming into the ICU and ER's."
8371,6.
8372,The administration we had when the first sustained waves of infections hit in the spring of 2020 was probably the worst suited administration to deal with any crisis since Nero ruled over Rome in 68AD.
8373,7.
8374,"Denialism ran rampant in many communities in the US leading to many people ignoring public health information and distrusting the institutions providing that information, which helped the virus continue to spread as people refused to wear masks and practice social distancing in the early days of the Pandemic."
8375,This problem persists to this day with anti-vaxxers and anti-maskers continuing to spread their toxic vitriol.
8376,8.
8377,"The population of the US, especially in the hardest hit demographics, have some of the highest incident rates of the comorbidities that lead to more severe Covid infections, such as Diabetes, heart disease, and chronic pulmonary issues in the world."

8402,Boy were we wrong.
8403,I feel so dumb that it didn’t even occur to me that half of the freaking population would just flat out refuse it.
8404,"Our kids started school wearing masks, despite our district having no mask mandate and then after having thousands quarantined and 300% more positive cases than a neighboring district WITH a mask mandate, they finally started what they called a “mask mandate”, but gave the parents the ability to “opt out”."

8409,Same here vaccinated and sick with covid with loss of smell.
8410,But it lasted only 3 days and I'm already getting it back slowly.
8411,This is absolute nonsense.
8412,I had COVID is March of 2020 and I can honestly say it is far worse than the flu and I still have lingering issue.
8413,This is complete and total misinformation and you are downplaying a disease that kills almost 1 in 50 people.
8414,My father bought into the conspiracy that the entirely legitimate disease was released insidiously to force people to get vaccinated against their will.
8415,I don't think he would get vaccinated even if he got sick either.

8422,Who would want that?
8423,Just get your shots.
8424,"No, your fear is not justified."
8425,"It's really not that big of a deal, you will feel exactly the same way after the shot as before."
8426,It's just a shot.
8427,"It's important to get it, but it *doesn't change you*."
8428,"Does participating in an uncontrolled crowd-sourced trial of horse dewormer count as ""doing research""?"
8429,Maybe she should try that instead of clogging up hospital beds...
8430,"when our new daily cases and daily deaths are back to a reasonable level, like they were in June, then it would make more sense to losses restrictions."
8431,But that’s not where we’re at.
8432,"If everyone is vaccinated then gathering is fine, if you arent vaccinated you should avoid gathering."
8433,The problem is the same people that gathered last year are the ones unvaccinated who are going to gather regardless
8434,"Another flaw in the mandate as described in New York, you only need 1st shot."
8435,But the 1st shot far less effective than 2 shots.
8436,"In fact, the CDC doesn’t even consider that “vaccinated” because the protection is so poor."
8437,"And in actuality, it’s not known commonly, but the CDC certainly knows it, for the first few days after the 1st shot you’re actually MORE infectious!"
8438,"In point of fact, New York only mandated 1 shot, because they knew so many people would be kicked out of their jobs and restaurants, etc."
8439,if they mandated 2 shots.
8440,"In point of fact, only ~60% of New Yorkers fully vaxxed."
8441,New York knew they couldn’t get away with forcing ~40% of people needing to be fired because they weren’t fully vaxxed.
8442,So they only required 1 shot even though that’s pretty worthless for reducing transmission.
8443,This what I mean by the mandates not following the most up-to-date science.
8444,"It's okay to be scared, I'm pretty sure most of us are always scared when getting a shot."
8445,"But you'll be fine, almost 6.4 billion shots have been given worldwide!"
8446,"It's that time of the year (happens pretty continuously, but it goes into overdrive on around holidays) where people claim they're the victim because they won't get vaccinated despite the fact that they were always going to do whatever they wanted anyway."
8447,I think most of these people suffer from health anxiety/mental health.
8448,It’s like trying to argue with someone with a phobia not to be afraid of their fear target.
8449,"Unfortunately, social media enables this type of thinking, but as fewer regular people feel this way, real life is increasingly frustrating"
8450,I made a pretty specific statement.

8456,"I mean, Fauci's job isn't to make sure you have a nice Christmas, it's to keep people safe in the face of public health crises, which we're still facing."
8457,It's not surprising at all really that he would be leaning towards this guidance.
8458,Whether you agree with it or not (I'm vaccinated and plan on NOT taking this advice.
8459,"I will be gathering with my vaccinated family and friends), I don't think it's fair to throw Fauci's advice away entirely because he's erring on the side of caution."
8460,But you've also never really lived through a pandemic before.
8461,"If we were going through a flu pandemic, it's quite possible you'd have to prove you had your flu shot."
8462,"Circumstances change, there is no telling what 6 months from now looks like, let alone a few years."
8463,"It's a rather possible outcome that if this is indeed the last serious wave, and prevalence drops to a point where this becomes a seasonal inconvenience, there won't be any mandates."
8464,I think it will go smoothly for you!
8465,It's OK tell the staff at the vaccination site that you are a little nervous.
8466,they will help you feel at ease 👍
8467,[removed]
8468,"So they would need to go through the same testing , even if it was just a variation of the OG version?"
8469,They can't piggyback off the original approval since itd be largely the same?
8470,"Because to be maximally utilitarian, we would skip the boosters and instead ship our vaccines to the parts of the world with both lower vaccination rates and higher population density."
8471,"If we did this you'd see more short/medium-term deaths in developed nations, but also reduced overall transmission globally."
8472,From a selfless perspective this means fewer overall deaths.
8473,From a more selfish perspective it means fewer mutations in the virus which would ultimately benefit all of us in the long run.
8474,"The reason it looks like no one in charge knows what the plan is right now is because there's a debate going on between scientists and politicians, and they're on more than two sides."
8475,Shipping our vaccines away and telling people they have to wait until they are almost fully vulnerable again to get a booster is probably prudent but politically impossible.

8529,We also know that the more people that get infected increases the chances of mutation that's more serious.
8530,Thankfully some of the more deadly strains aren't as contagious as Delta (and Delta is more deadly than the original strain) because they just can't compete with Delta.

8567,It was no joke to recover from.
8568,"&amp;#x200B;

The Flu ***can*** kick your ass and does to many people worldwide every single year."
8569,"One or more of the dozens of  strains of Influenza A and B circulating every year can also cause mild infections that are often diagnosed as/ assumed to be common colds, as well as a significant number of completely asymptomatic infections."
8570,"You are right though, if you are diagnosed with the flu and have symptoms associated with what is correctly labeled as ""the flu"", it does kick your ass and can cause potentially life-threatening complications as well as chronic health issues that last long after the virus runs it's course through your body."
8571,"Could've just left it at ""I can't think"""
8572,It's all in your mind.
8573,:-) I had only a little arm pain.
8574,Other folks I know had a day of rest and were fine after that.
8575,Also live in New England but have a very different experience.
8576,Most towns in my area have mask requirements.
8577,I’d say 98% of the people I see still wear masks.
8578,My work requires masks.
8579,My wife’s work requires masks and testing every time you go in.
8580,I’m not entirely avoiding gatherings but cannot say we are back to normal by any means.
8581,I can't believe the insurance companies and Actuaries haven't been more vocal in this.
8582,It comes down to the money employers pay for their portion of their employees health insurance.
8583,"If that goes up --and rightly so, COVID is expensive to treat in an ICU-- employers will either pass those costs onto their employees or just mandate vaccinations to prevent that rise."

8591,For Fauci to even suggest the possibility that people should spend a second year away from their families is just inviting backlash.
8592,He should be talking about mitigating risks and encouraging family members to get vaccinated.
8593,Because the current vaccines work perfectly fine against Delta.
8594,Somehow this got lost.
8595,There is a slight decline in efficacy against mild illness but this isn't enough to justify another vaccine.
8596,Yeah you are right - by that covid death compensation logic western countries human life is worth approx $0.
8597,Am I right in saying that NZ's hospital infrastructure - specifically in the area of ICU and ITU provision - is not up to par?
8598,"Or, put another way, not best placed to handle above-average volumes of patients?"
8599,"I remember reading about their recent RSV explosion and how their ICU/ITU capabilities - or, lack thereof - were shown up to be insufficient in terms of quantity and quality to meet demand."
8600,I freely admit that I may be well off-base on this one...
8601,"Where I was living, you needed to be a minimum of four months recovered from a Covid infection before being eligible to get a Covid vaccine."

This messaging is so ridiculous."

8617,I feel very comfortable gathering with my vaccinated family and friends now - no masks unless someone present requests it.
8618,"Before Covid, one of ""the flu's"" were responsible for the previous deadliest pandemic in US history, back in 1918."
8619,"Much of the protocols used to contain emergent infectious diseases to this day are based on a response to a pandemic Flu of that nature, last used against an Influenza virus in 2009 with the novel emergent H1N1 Swine Flu, which luckily was not any more serious than other seasonal varieties of influenza."

8621,We had our school lunches changed entirely due to heart disease.
8622,The first lady of the United States launched a nationwide initiative to better heart health in children from 08-2016.
8623,Heart Health markings have been on cereal boxes since I was a child.
8624,"And the kicker is, the closest we got to regular heart health visits at a primary care physician for ALL was with the ACA, where any ideas of universal health screenings and treatment were aggressively struck down by the right."
8625,"People who like to diminish COVID deaths by comparing them to heart disease deaths, while simultaneously refusing any and all measures to lower COVID deaths, don't care about life at all."
8626,They only care about the right to die of one's own ignorance.
8627,So basically an Indian human life is worth approx $700 for their government.
8628,"If a room full of fully vaxxed people isn't good enough to get rid of masks, then nothing is and we'll be wearing these god damn things forever."
8629,Nope.

8653,I used to be amazed at the idiotic actions in a lot of Zombie/Monster movies that denied the obvious existence of the monsters or ignored some obvious issue.

8667,"A key line also, to be fair:

This is because the number of people who have been given this vaccine is low, at less than 2 per cent of the population, Mr Ong said"

At least 92% of Denver’s municipal employees were vaccinated against COVID-19 as of Friday, a day after the city’s vaccine mandate took effect in a bid to slow the spread of the virus during the fall and winter, according to a review of city compliance data."
8695,The employee vaccination rate is higher than Denver’s latest overall vaccination rate of 76% and the statewide rate of 70%.
8696,Employees were required to either prove they were vaccinated or obtain an exemption to the mandate by the end of Thursday or face possible termination.
8697,"According to city data, 98.6% of its current 10,869 full-time employees complied with the mandate, either by being vaccinated or receiving an exemption."

8703,"All blame, from me, on previous admin and the disinformation guys."

8856,They're still allowing cruise ships into Alaska.
8857,"Yet basically all Alaska hospitals are under crisis standards of care, both urban and rural."

8865,"Governments are allowing this private company, that was infiltrated by hostile actors, from destabilizing the world and aren't doing anything about it."
8866,They might as well allow foreign soldiers to come into your country to wage war and pretend its business as usual.
8867,Its not apples and oranges.
8868,NBA was an even longer bubble w/ a strain that was even more contagious than the wuhan strain at the time(delta being the dominant one now).
8869,The fact that Tokyo olympics still happened after a state of emergency already proved that this was gonna be a shitshow and much of japan still did not have access to vaccines.
8870,"Olympics only happened because the government did not want to pick the bill up if they decided to cancel it, and because of that the locals paid the price."

8881,Hopefully this one goes away soon too.
8882,I think Canada has done a lot right to get us to this point.
8883,"We have an amazing vaccination rate, people are mostly compliant with masks everywhere, limiting store occupancy is still cool."

8972,"If someone is wondering, this is what they said:

8973,"&gt; It also said a booster shot of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine could be considered for adults with normal immune systems around six months after the second dose, but added that was up to individual countries."

9039,My parents and my brother (all fully vaccinated with Pfizer) want to come visit (in Canada) but they live abroad.
9040,They will have to take 2 airplanes (5 hours &amp; 4 hours).
9041,We are terrified of contracting COVID since one of my 3 little ones is immunocompromised (and we have been in complete lockdown for over a year accordingly).
9042,Originally we were going to send them to a hotel for 14 days but then we decided on maybe sending them to a hotel for 3-4 days and then get them tested before they can come here.
9043,"This article says “someone who has, or is suspected of having, COVID-19 should get tested three to five days after exposure”."
9044,Does it mean that if my parents/brother get tested 3 days after their trip and they show negative we can safely bring them home with us?
9045,Thank you very much for your insight.
9046,There is so much information and sadly I keep finding conflicting statements.
9047,"But the HPV shots are spaced out in long increments of time and it's still the prescribribed 3-dose regimen, not 1 shot and 2 boosters, though the time between is great."
9048,That's more like *being* research.

9050,That’s a more fair comparison since most people wouldn’t know what technically counts as “the city” is more limited than is typical in other areas.

9199,"That’s a matter of opinion, you could say yourself that 0.1% is highly effective."
9200,And that’s precisely why I hate it when adjectives are used instead of numbers.
9201,Another poster said 60-90% is the definition but I haven’t seen that as the standardized.
9202,If that’s the case then it’s better but the exact number is still ideal.

9231,Half her coworkers aren't vaccinated either and they share the same break room and bathroom of course.
9232,I am in healthcare and I got 3rd Pfizer dose 2 weeks ago.
9233,"Back in March, I had the chance to get her Pfizer or Moderna."
9234,But went with J&amp;J because of the convenience.
9235,"Now with the silence on J&amp;J from the authorities (not to mention the pause), we are both very anxious of her catching the delta and not having any immunity to fight it."
9236,Not to mention the enormous guilt I have.
9237,Both my parents and brother got their booster doses this week.
9238,"Not to mention, the countless other people I was able to get vaccinated in the early days with Pfizer who are all getting the booster now."
9239,Please advise on getting the two dose Pfizer or Moderna now for her.

9251,[The charts](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm) look to me like circulation is low.
9252,"But I wonder if people are actually being tested for the flu, or if it’s going around and our numbers don’t show it?"
9253,"(I know you can’t necessarily “time” the best moment to get a flu shot, but if the flu really isn’t circulating anywhere in the US at the moment, it seems like a person who’s at low risk of serious adverse outcomes might not be foolish to wait?)"
9254,Anecdotal evidence is that someone I know locally who is vaccinated got sick and tested negative for COVID.
9255,"He attributed his illness to the flu, which he said is going around, but I doubt he was actually tested for it."
9256,(I would GUESS that his COVID negative was accurate because he also caught COVID before vaccines were available.)

9292,"It's like the old saying ""you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink""."
9293,Our high death count is mainly due to people who chose not to take the vaccination now getting sick.

FAUCI: Well, MARGARET, I believe just the way the CDC has recommended that when you are in a situation where you have a dynamic of virus in the community, where there's clearly a lot of spread, even if you are vaccinated and you are in an indoor setting, a congregate setting, it just makes sense to wear a mask and to avoid high risk situations."
9447,And what we should be doing is look at ventilation in indoor places.
9448,"We know now that this is clearly spread by aerosol, and when you have something spread by aerosol, you absolutely want more ventilation, which is the reason why outdoors is always much safer than indoors."
9449,"And if you are indoors, ventilation is going to be key."
9450,And that's the reason why we really should be paying attention to that.

9498,Just because we don't have experience with the advancements taking place is cardiac medicine doesn't mean they're not happening.
9499,Irrr...so do tell.
9500,What do you mean?
9501,Yeah I’d like to see a source on that too.
9502,There’s also a difference between breakthrough cases and coming down with the disease.
9503,Here's one I found:  https://thedaily.case.edu/new-study-nursing-home-residents-health-care-workers-lose-more-than-80-of-their-covid-19-immunity-six-months-after-pfizer-vaccine/
9504,This guy sounds like an uncle whose read too many WhatsApp chains

9508,I was told 3 months
9509,"I don't know about Thanksgiving, but all three of us will likely be fully vaccinated by Christmas (#3 is 9 yo) and if the other two aren't willing to visit family on Christmas I will go on my own, because I cannot take any more of this shit."
9510,I got my first jab 3 days after I was eligible and my second on schedule.
9511,"If it spreads and the unvaccinated die, well, they should have gotten vaccinated."
9512,My sympathy is gone.
9513,My patience is gone.
9514,It's all just gone.
9515,"My husband's entire family is almost completely vaccinated, took precautions last year and all."
9516,But they have been have big family gatherings since the beginning of summer and there is a wedding we actually aren't attending that is going to be pretty big this month.
9517,Even after his grandmother got a breakthrough case.
9518,"We won't attend any of the gatherings, unfortunately including the wedding."
9519,"Well they were driving him crazy, so…"

9563,"Yeah, if we drop a lot of what is happening, it could actually go really bad."
9564,People don't understand statistics at all.
9565,Especially when it comes to multiplicative effects with dire consequences.
9566,Also I think a huge number of people fail to realize what's happening in particular  circumstances.
9567,The problem is that the numbers vary greatly with age.
9568,"Every single case in this study was male, even though the study was over half females."
9569,That alone more than doubles the effective rate in males.
9570,"Moreover, they were all under age 33."
9571,"A rate of 5.3 per million is definitely rare, and even still 10 per million (for males only) is, but when you start to look at the rate specifically for males between certain ages, that rate goes up."
9572,"Even if it’s still rare, it may be an order of magnitude more likely than this number suggests, and is worth looking out for."
9573,they seem to be having way more luck keeping numbers low than australia.
9574,"The benefit is measurable, but not tremendous: a bit less than a 2-fold improvement in neutralization in [Moderna's data](https://investors.modernatx.com/static-files/c43de312-8273-4394-9a58-a7fc7d5ed098) for Beta/multivalent vaccination versus Beta, and we may lack this data for Delta."
9575,A 2-fold improvement is quite substantial though - with our current 20-25% [monthly antibody waning](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2103916) this would amount to several extra months of protection at the same level.
9576,But the cost is almost nothing and the benefit is definitely a good bit more than nothing.
9577,"My guess is the difficulty of getting approval across multiple countries is holding the mRNA manufacturers back, and that at some point there's going to be a pretty fast cascade of switching over to a multivalent vaccine."
9578,Know what?
9579,I mean there have been studies done on babies born to mothers who had vaccines during pregnancy.
9580,The babies were shown to have antibodies.
9581,"Breastfeeding isn’t as protective, but gives the baby some."
9582,This is known?
9583,It’s the entire justification for many vaccines given in pregnancy

9585,As an American living in Canada (who has gone back to the US three times in the last 6 months) it's amazing how fearful Canadians still are.
9586,You'd think Canada had 7 million dead from this thing with how much people still telling others to live like it is April 2020.
9587,That's not to say the US has it right.
9588,It's pretty lax (especially by those without any vaccine protection) but just interesting to see the difference.
9589,[deleted]
9590,Nobody will listen anyway
9591,"Yes, I do"
9592,We’re talking about holiday travel during Christmas.
9593,For the same reason that every other side effect is more likely with the second dose.
9594,Everyone I know says the first dose wasn't bad but the second dose knocked them on their ass.
9595,Perhaps there are IV injections of the first dose but they are less likely to result in myocarditis because the immune system has not been trained to respond yet.
9596,Yeah sounds normal.
9597,You are from Australia right?
9598,A lot of countries that managed the pandemic were late for the vaccine
9599,Low income people are less likely to have their own washer/dryer.
9600,Coin ops are expensive in both money and time.
9601,You can't just put a load in and go do something else.

9618,I mean i wouldn’t have any issue testing personally.
9619,"New moms be nervous, that’s just the way of it."
9620,A few years ago it was asking ppl to get whooping cough boosters before seeing their baby.
9621,I work in a pharmacy and we dispose of doses twice a day when we don't use up a vial.
9622,Better in your arm than in the trash can.
9623,It’s the unvaccinated heading to the hospitals.
9624,"Covid is here forever, so as lo go as you are in a state where the hospitals are doing fine monitoring the raw number of cases is irrelevant; you’ll be exposed to it eventually."
9625,Lots of people needed that money.
9626,That’s why it was a available.
9627,"Agreed, and none of the advice has been."
9628,It would be better if you didn’t but if you are going to you might want to think about trying this.
9629,I really believe that last year around the holidays rapid tests could have saved quite a few lives and definitely some medical bills.
9630,Who is waiting for a pcr test and acting all cautious while you wait.
9631,I popped into a cvs and picked up a box of 2 tests on the way to my grandmas house because my kid had a runny nose and I felt a little under the weather.
9632,He took one as did I.
9633,No covid and we had a wonderful visit.
9634,If we threw a positive we would have turned right around.
9635,Even the most ardent denier doesn’t want to see their family members die because of covid but their heels are too dug in to want to do anything that involves reporting anything.

9667,"Those with high exposure risk should definitely get another dose after 6 months, but just get a single booster shot of moderna or pfizer."
9668,All the research is in complete agreement that an mRNA dose considerably after a vectored dose is going to increase immunity substantially.
9669,"I mean truthfully, rsv is way more dangerous in babies."
9670,That’s probably enough reason to keep the baby at home.
9671,Rsv is really bad this year
9672,NBA 2020 Bubble did not have people flying in internationally in the 10s of thousands.

9674,Apples and oranges.
9675,"Also I used the phrase ""was one of"" for a reason, I never implied it was the strictest."
9676,For that you'd have to look at Wuhan or North Korea.
9677,Yeah I don't disagree.
9678,I don't mind hanging out with vaccinated people.
9679,The problem is I don't really like hanging out with my family in the first place and especially not when they're acting like anti-vax morons lol so I'm happy to not see them for the holidays again.
9680,It’s not hard to get a test in NYC and it hasn’t been since the first few months or so of the pandemic.

9689,Whether J&amp;J might cause the same severe side effects I don't know.
9690,For a 65-year old a second dose is really quite valuable.
