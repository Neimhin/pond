1,"To be fair, nor do Japan and Taiwan."
2,"Changes to our way of life after 9/11: tighter security at airports, and we allow the government to spy on us more than previously."

13,The middle class in all these countries are being phased out.
14,Living standards of this generation will be below that of their parents.
15,Singapore's governance has always been considered second to none of the world stage.
16,"The real income of our middle class has grown decade upon decade, 90% of our people own houses, and we have dealt efficiently with COVID with less than 40 death in a population of 4 million."
17,"Our life expectancy ranks one of the world's highest, we have two universities in the World Top 50 (despite being a country of only 4 million!"
18,"), our healthcare ranks among the best in the world and our crime rate one of the lowest."

42,"In a place like NYC earlier this year, it made more sense to mandate mask-wearing outdoors."
43,"Here in the midwest, I never wore a mask outdoors over the summer, but now that my town is saturated with covid, I do."
44,It's nbd to wear a mask.
45,It's more uncomfortable to me to wear a bra than a mask.

66,"You're making sense here, ok."
67,"So there is a particular website I check every day that tracks the numbers in a helpful graph, and in the last month the infected numbers skyrocketed and in the last few days the death number have followed suit."
68,In fact the death graph looks exactly like it did in the two week period immediately before New York City reached 4000 deaths a day.
69,"Except this time it’s not just going to happen in New York City, it’s going to happen all over the country, at once."

77,"In all seriousness, how do you feel about adding risk to someone else's job?"
78,"It's weird because in order for you to protect yourself to the level you feel necessary, you're forcing other to do your work."
79,"I don't think it's hypocritical or wrong per se, but it's a weird thing to me, holding up at home while other people work for low wages to bring you stuff."
80,The highest estimates have about 10% of the US population as having contracted Covid.
81,At least 70% is needed for there to be any benefits from herd immunity.
82,"We are still years, and millions of deaths away from that number."
83,look I do believe that governments matter and that the rules of the game can encourage behaviour but there are 'capitalist' countries doing a good job as well.
84,it goes into much more deep aspects of culture.
85,"I posted that they’re an anti-Chinese propaganda arm, and your response is to say it’s bullshit as evidenced by the fact that “they have written plenty of anti china anti ccp articles”?"

99,&gt;No you got that part totally backwards.
100,It's \_HER\_ idea that Tegnell rejects as an experiment to allow spread.
101,Yes... that's exactly what I said.
102,"From my first comment:

&gt;Anders Tegnell, current state epidemiologist, does not agree."
103,"Linde was talking about a ""rapid herd immunity strategy"", while Tegnell was talking about a ""controlled herd immunity strategy""."
104,"They were both talking about obtaining herd immunity, but two different ways of achieving it."
105,"&gt;""limiting spread as much as possible"" as planning for herd immunity by autumn."
106,"No, that was not it at all."
107,"It says exactly what the ""experiment"" was:

&gt;However, the current state epidemiologist has nothing left to possibly experiment with the spread of infection in society at large, for example to achieve flock immunity **more quickly**:

Tegnell thought it was too risky to attempt to achieve herd immunity **quickly**, but did not think there was any inherent risk in the attempting to achieve it in a slow controlled manner which is what their tactics were based on."
108,"The thing is, you and other Tegnell supporters are ""forgetting"" that there is more than one ""herd immunity"" strategy."
109,"Every time you see Tegnell denying he pursued a herd immunity strategy, he makes it clear he's talking about a strategy where there is no attempt made to slow the spread, and maybe even an attempt made to hasten it."
110,"That's not the strategy he chose to follow, without a doubt."
111,"However, there is another method where you ""let it seep through slowly"" so that herd immunity is eventually achieved without ""harm\[ing\] your society more than necessary."""
112,"""It's like with forest fires and other things, that if you can just make it burn a little slowly and carefully, you can make it burn out."""
113,"That is a herd immunity strategy, and that is exactly what their strategy was, right from the very beginning."
114,"&gt;In order for Sweden to achieve flock immunity, six million inhabitants would be affected by the virus."
115,"&gt;  
&gt;\- Yes, but at the same time we must remember that the vast majority will become very slightly ill. We do not know how big this so-called dark number is, but there is a lot to suggest that it is very, very big, says Anders Tegnell."
116,"&gt;  
&gt;\- **Even if it sounds like a lot, it may be one of these 60 percent who get really sick and maybe five or six of those who need care."
117,"** **If you can then smear these five-six percent in six-eight-ten-twelve months, it is manageable for healthcare."
118,"**

That was the goal."
119,He admitted it almost from day one.
120,"Only later, when it became clear how stupid a goal it really was, did he start to deny it."
121,"California needs to secede man, so sick of these dumb fascists."
122,Excellent advice
123,[deleted]
124,It’s not the reopening that I have a problem with.
125,Some places really can open safely.
126,But the anti-mask people in the US are as bad as anyone.
127,They believe the government has created the virus so they can control people by making them wear a mask.
128,"Equally importantly, the Chinese government wasn't the one who ignored it."
129,"It's an important distinction, the evidence of cover-up really only is based on the actions of local officials, once the central government became aware, shit got clamped down, hard and fast."
130,Shudder.
131,"So with your infected leaning towards the younger groups, it's reasonable to assume that the US currently has something like 500k infections a day."
132,"So if vaccines prove to be curbing the spread and can be applied at scale in a few months, I find it reasonable to assume that 1 in 3 US citizens will have Covid-19 at some point."
133,"Not eligible, sadly - but thank you!"
134,"Not everyone, no."
135,But as of now there’s tons of people who are positive/presymptomatic/asymptomatic walking around infecting others.
136,"If even a portion of them knew they were contagious and stayed home, it would help."
137,"Still, using this representation, U.S. COVID deaths are the equivalent of 1,250 planes crashing in just 10 months since ~February - all due to a cause that didn’t exist last year."
138,Which state did we test atomic bombs in?
139,"I think you're really not understanding, and the problem is this:

&gt;lucky enough to have been born in one of the few countries with a social safety net."
140,*Most* developed countries have a social safety net.
141,"Seriously, the USA is a complete anomaly."
142,Your needs are created by a government that doesn't care about its people.
143,"That's why the rest of us are looking at them all cock-eyed and using quotation marks around ""needs."""
144,It doesn't make any sense to us.
145,"Lots of people I know have been furloughed, but they won't be destitute if they end up needing medical care."
146,"It's still scary, and some people are downsizing because without income they can't afford huge homes, but good gracious, they can eat and be healthy without working, because that's what a government should do."
147,"in these trying times, the phrase ""grim milestone"" has become the new normal, but we're in this together"
148,"As opposed to the Trumpsters that made supporting a specific candidate their entire personality for 4 years, almost like a *cult of personality*?"
149,"God you guys are actual, non-ironic NPCs."
150,Well said.
151,Offensive to hard of hearing people.
152,Just like most people won’t wear a clear mask to help deaf and hard of hearing people understand speech.
153,But I guess most people don’t care if it doesn’t affect them

155,Fauci is the closest thing we have to a “scientist  warning about the apocalypse and no one pays attention to him” at the beginning of an apocalypse movie.
156,This guy deserves a motherfucking shrine at the end of this.
157,I don’t know how one man can have this much endurance against this much stupidity.
158,"Thank you Fauci for never giving up on informing the public, and being one of the only public figures that is humble enough to answer “I don’t know.” I hope he understands that rational people understand how above and beyond he has gone for us."
159,:(
160,Meanwhile a million plus passengers are going traveling for Thanksgiving because they got a test that says they are 100% safe 🙃🥴
161,No...
162,But we got forced to return it to the people (German here)
163,"Let's say, for the sake of argument, that you are correct, and the CCP covered up the pandemic in the beginning."
164,"Conceding that, world governments have known about covid since December or 2019, and they have know about how contagious it is since early February."
165,How is the supposed CCP cover-up the cause of the current situation in the US?
166,If you’re eligible to donate blood the Red Cross will do it for free.
167,Fuck Mitch McConnell.

173,or maybe both and nothing at the same time because science
174,They actually have a functioning government that help their people through it.
175,We Americas just know our government doesn’t have the will nor capability to pull off the same feat.
176,"So instead of a “harsh” eight week lock down with all the supplies needed, we have this cluster fuck."
177,Yeah right.
178,Always some asshole scientist stopping things.
179,"The more that pass, the merrier, world is too crowded, we can easily lose 1-5b people and be okay."
180,"I would almost say 6-8b more liberally, but a lot of emotions right now."
181,"The moment you allow any type of movement, the virus spreads."
182,"As we can't lock everyone in their homes, there's unfortunately no way to fully stop the spread."
183,[removed]
184,Too real
185,"By January, more likely."
186,i guess you'd have to be one of those selfish lockdown skeptics who can't do math to think that
187,It's going to be dead at Christmas.
188,They are absolutely nuts
189,"The article suggests that 5 million travelled overseas, which is incorrect."
190,"Our first couple of cases in Australia didn't come from China as we had some of the earliest cases, they came from Europe."
191,I'm so damn frustrated.
192,"I can't visit family and have a meal for Thanksgiving, but my Wife and I could go out to eat at a restaurant around strangers?"
193,"Wife and I can't go to grocery store \_together\_ to get large trips done to cut down on the amount of times we need to go during a month for a family of 5 because it heightens the risk of exposure to others, but hundreds of thousands of people this year have been out in the streets with signs in cities all over the country with seemingly no worry."
194,Couldn't take the kids Trick or Treating this year but Disneyland is open.
195,Neighbors haven't been sick all year staying at home.
196,On either side of us.
197,I haven't been sick since March.
198,But if our 3 families got together since we can't visit families on Thanksgiving?
199,Wear masks inside and social distance?
200,Possibly face fines?
201,I already expect them to not only Cancel Christmas and New Year's but to also tell us that even though we get our Vaccines (when available) that we STILL can't go out.
202,I'm probably going to hit a mental breaking point by then.
203,"I mean, all my VA appointments were cancelled this year."
204,"No annual physical with a new Doctor, now mental health checks, no meds, no therapy."
205,It's been rough.
206,"But hey, they started to open gyms and movie theaters...."
207,Well I hope your wrong friend
208,What is there to correct?
209,"You found a portal to a web page, a web portal so to speak."
210,Michigan is trying to pause to see if they can at least somewhat mitigate Thanksgiving.
211,Hoping to only have the partial shutdown last three weeks.
212,"We'll need to shutdown till next year at least.. Christmas will be no better, the holiday season will be a catastrophe."
213,Your definition of low risk gathering may be different...
214,I see the average thanksgiving day gathering as very high risk.
215,"- Family members are unlikely to wear masks or distance

- Family elders are likely to be present, whom are high risk

- Children are likely to be present, whom have a high probability of being asymptomatic carriers, especially if they attend in-person schooling."
216,"Contact with children is likely to be especially close -- those little buggers won't stay off, lol."
217,"- Duration is likely to be prolonged; several hours at least in most cases

- False sense of security due to testing and other probably questionable measures

I hope I'm wrong, but expect a spike in cases 1st/2nd week of Dec."
218,"This is definitely something I hope I'm full of shit about, but.."
219,The decision for a severe lock down in Adelaide was based on people lying to the contract tracers.
220,It embarrassed the government a little and makes me worried they will not do any lock downs in the future when Adelaide needs them.
221,All so predictable.
222,All so preventable.
223,"At this point, it is the equivalent of cigarette companies arguing that there is no causal link between smoking and lung cancer."
224,"I used to think I was *modestly* more intelligent than 50% of the population....after the election and now where we are with COVID I know I’m easily, EASILY smarter than 80% of Americans."
225,Shit...makes me feel good man.
226,I know work acquaintances that are traveling like nothing is wrong.
227,They cite that United put out some CDC study that an airplane is one of the safest indoor places to be with all the measurements.
228,Even if it’s true.
229,I know of two that are in Medellin Colombia right now for tourism.
230,"To some, it’s like this doesn’t exist and it’s life as normal now that some borders are open."
231,Apparently the question on that survey was extremely poorly worded.
232,"It basically asked if you were going to go to events with less than 10 people, and so combined the group going to an event with more 10 or more people along with the people who are staying home into a single statistic."

239,I really feel for their population.

241,And then the virus and the government doesn’t put any funding to testing or anything.
242,They are really screwed
243,"Tonight, for the first time since this all started, I entered (unknowingly) a business that was not on board with masks."
244,I was blown away.
245,"Signs all over the place, inside and out; ""No Mask?"
246,We won't ask!?
247,""", ""Mask or not, your decision!""."
248,Nice sign on register too about saying they are cleared by the County Health Dept./We are exempt from any state regs.
249,"The 2 workers, no masks (owner and his wife)."
250,"Father and his son come in (maybe 12 yo), no masks."
251,This was a small local pizza shop.
252,"What the fuck, people?"
253,What the fuck.
254,There is no sense of cohesion in the US.
255,Long term effects of a poor education system.

307,A millionaire is closer to being homeless than to being a billionaire.

309,But to become a billionaire the millionaire must increase his wealth by 100000%.
310,I don't understand people who can't see the basic math of how that works and think they're closer to being Bezos than to being homeless.
311,No it’s not easy and we don’t have to be in this position.

347,F) Results need to have 24-48 turnaround time (but ideally less than 24 hours) and essential workers need to be compensated if it prevents them from going into work.
348,"Regardless of their PTO, if they have any."
349,G) Testing should be free without needing to dispute a surprise copay with the (uncooperative) insurance company.
350,H) The above two conditions should apply even if the person keeps testing themselves over ‘false alarms’ or just because.

389,Positive tests with high Ct values are usually reflective of the stage of infection rather than how infectious someone is.
390,"For example, you'd expect high Ct values from someone who has recently recovered from the disease."

500,&gt; If we want to vaccinate the 70% of the population who are saying they want it we are talking about 252 days.
501,This is sadly the more realistic number.
502,People saying everyone will get it in spring and summer will be normal are kidding themselves.
503,Even the people who make the vaccines are saying it'll be ~8 months till we hit 70%.
504,That means cases will continue to rise relatively for the next 8 months (relatively because there appears to be a seasonal factor)
505,We haven’t shut down since the initial shutdown back in like March
506,Let's be honest.
507,"Many, and probably most, people have not been completely self-isolating for 9 months."
508,"Plenty of people have been going to bars, restaurants and attending private gatherings since late spring/early summer when the lockdown ended."
509,I would guess that most of the people who are traveling and attending large or medium-sized Thanksgiving gatherings have already been seeing their families for months.
510,But we're in the middle one of the biggest surges we've had so far and many states are seeing record-breaking infection rates.
511,Now is *not* the time to be traveling and partying.
512,One year without Thanksgiving and Christmas parties is not going to kill anyone.
513,"Actually, just the opposite -- traveling and parties most definitely will wind up killing some people."
514,I would imagine yes.
515,"Not even a Sooners fan, lol."

551,Not.
552,Very.
553,Safe.
554,Unfortunately I see vaccination becoming a political thing.
555,"Sure and using protection doesn't mean you're guaranteed to not have kids, but the odds are a hell of a lot lower."
556,This stance is basically abstinence education for the disease.
557,You need to include time for questions from reviewers and responses from Pfizer.
558,My assumption is this review involves a lot more than just the trial results.
559,The application probably includes all of the measures they plan to take in distribution and steps they are taking to prevent degradation and cross contamination of the vaccine.
560,The application is probably a lot more complex than people imagine.
561,"Finally, the most critical aspect of a vaccine rollout will be earning public trust."
562,"95 percent efficacy data is great, but a vaccine is only effective if enough people are willing to take it."
563,"If more people are willing to take it because the process between the companies and the FDA was transparent and thorough, that will pay off in the long run."
564,Covid has altered my view towards Americans in general: Smart and safe or stupid and spreading.
565,Totally free (if you pay for insurance)
566,The logical conclusion is that more countries should do testing of past sample and investigate.
567,But when will the people learn!!!!!!!
568,!
569,Attending outdoor events is pretty low risk.
570,"No you don't necessarily have to attend, but as long as you stay away from other people you will be fine."
571,I snap my fingers at people and tell them to pull their mask up and they do.
572,I must have crazy eyes or something.
573,What do you mean when you say “we have to fucking make them obey us”?
574,Vaccines are more important.
575,This is super expensive too.
576,This is why the Spanish flu death toll is reported as having been 50 to 100 million dead.
577,A mere 100 per cent variation.
578,We can expect similar I guess.
579,"Come on dude, you clearly messed what I meant."

583,"Again not all on her,its both sides."
584,Give it a Google.
585,I think the countless people who got it a second time much sooner than this may disagree.
586,I’m still undulate if it is worse or easier second time around.
587,I’m seeing cases on both sides.

590,Every BODY is different.
591,Stop putting timelines on shit.
592,"This makes the people I know who had Covid fee invincible, even though they had it months ago and could easily get and spread again."
593,"Taking a step back, it’s been obvious for months they are fueling the fire."
594,It’s articles like this that will get those who had it feel immune... go out... get it... spread.
595,Ah.
596,Makes sense if you’re on that side of the line as to what’s happening here in the US.
597,"Like I said in another comment, this was entirely unprecedented, but we have the top minds in the world working nonstop as we speak in order to end this as fast as fucking possible."
598,"Yes, science takes time and vaccines take time,  but in the meantime; let’s listen to the people who dedicated their entire lives to this."

604,Good luck!
605,"Sounds about right, but unfortunately the CDC has lost all credibility under Redfield."

608,"Yes, the measurable countries."
609,Also in deaths per capita we're doing pretty damn well.
610,"Yes the covid policy is shitty, the confusion is atrocious."
611,"In the beginning the virus was a 10% mortality rate, then it dropped to 5% then 2% then under 1%."
612,"The virus caused all these after effects, then they didn't."
613,"The virus lived on surfaces for weeks, then for hours, then it doesn't transmit on surfaces at all and it's only airborne but it can live in the air for hours, then its reported that UV kills it instantly."
614,"The reporting is awful too, in the beginning everything that ended in mortality when the patient had covid was documented as a covid death even car accidents."
615,Then they reported that all pneumonia cases were documented as covid.
616,"Then it's released that hospitals were getting government HMO payouts when flagging patients having covid and even more when they are flagged as a covid deaths, so the numbers got fudged."
617,Non stop confusion over the past year and this subreddit is contributing to that confusion more than most news networks.
618,This subreddit needs to go.
619,"It’s pretty bad here in Kansas they say yet I don’t know many people that have been infected and I haven’t been infected despite being in some relatively high risk areas, it’s strange."

626,or maybe none of us here know wtf we are talking about.
627,I'm in a bind.
628,I live in Washington state and my dad lives in Chicago.
629,"He's a recovering alcoholic with me, my wife, and our daughter as his only family to see on Thanksgiving and he's coming from Chicago."
630,Luckily we live in the sticks so we won't be going anywhere.
631,"I know he has a chance to spread it and transmit it but for me, it's better for his mental health to be with us on Thanksgiving."
632,I told him it might be better not to come but he sounded really depressed when I brought it up.
633,Not sure what the right answer is.
634,"It’s pretty bad here in Kansas they say yet I don’t know many people that have been infected and I haven’t been infected despite being in some relatively high risk areas, it’s strange."
635,I would have expected to catch it by now.

648,My family keeps saying they want new test subjects somehow.
649,"People are scared of possible side effects because ""vaccine take years to be made and we never had one for any coronavirus""."
650,Most people don't know part of the research for mers and SARS has been used and the h1n1 vaccine had a pretty bad reputation (which I'm not even sure is earned).
651,Add to that previous medical scandal around levothyroxine in France and you gave a breeding ground for people who are not full on antivax to gradually become sceptical of vaccines and medicine.
652,While it may appear stupid I think it quite make sense to see these reactions among a population that is neither truly aware of how research works and how these vaccines have been developed.

680,"If you take ""Patients Tested Positive for COVID-19, Any Test Type"" / ""Patients Tested for COVID-19, Any Test Type"", you get 10.3%... but almost all of the rows they have to indicate percent positive say 99-100%."

690,"They are well aware that as of right now, 30-60% of the populace *does not* want to go to a movie theater, even if Avengers Endgame II: The Star Wars Crossover was magically released."
691,"Thus, theaters are stuck showing microbudget movies nobody gives a shit about and whatever they can get cheaply for rep screenings--usually the kind of stuff that plays every weekend on basic cable."

709,Whats funny is people being stupid is a huge reason for antibiotic resistance.
710,"Tuberculosis in particular has a long antibiotic treatment (6 months), and because people stop taking them before that, there are now multi-drug resistant strains of TB which still infects 1/3 of the world."
711,I'm worried about the future of MRSA and the up and coming VRSA as well.
712,"Also my 67 year old Mom is recovering from secondary bacterial pneumonia right now, and she works at COSTCO."
713,"I feel like it's only a matter of time before she gets covid, and her body definitely can't fight it off right now."
714,Is there any other kind?
715,"Well, their stubbornness will lead to their undoing."
716,"I hate looking at it that way, but it’s what’s going to happen whether they believe it or not."
717,I’m in Indiana surrounded by idiots and was at Walmart today.
718,"Everyone had on masks, but a lot had them under their noses."
719,Most of the guilty were Walmart employees.
720,"I don't know, I hope you're right."
721,I don't know how much more of this shit I can take.
722,"As per article, that's 40 million doses but they take two doses, 20 it's enough for 20 million people."
723,Amazing - enough for probably 10% of the adult population.
724,"Light at the end of the tunnel (but that tunnel is going to claim another 50,000 lives before we get there)"
725,That sounds like a logistical nightmare.
726,Can you imagine the lines of cars outside the grocery stores?
727,I don’t think they have the staff.
728,"The more realistic answer is no, you can’t shut down all businesses."
729,Society can’t function that way.
730,"Yeah ok, you need to step back from your YouTube streamers and seriously consider checking into a mental institution."
731,You must be crazy to believe that agenda 2”3” is a deep state plot.
732,[deleted]
733,"(i know this is ridiculous to even mention but fun fact:  'heathens' in the middle ages, namely the Danes we now call vikings, bathed far more often than the Christians whos lands they invaded in the middle ages, and they took good care of their long hair.)"
734,Except a vaccine is being released as we speak.
735,If this had mutated so drastically...the vaccine wouldn’t do anything.
736,There has been no evidence of drastic mutations as to make immunity irrelevant.
737,Nice try though.
738,Also your crystals must need some charging.
739,Quick.
740,Get them on the window sill!
741,Your vibrations are getting low.
742,&gt;Anti-maskers — people who are against wearing face masks or coverings during COVID-19 — are often “black and white thinkers” who believe government health officials have lied to or misled them from the beginning.
743,"&gt;But instead of simply being skeptical, they automatically jump to: “We can’t believe anything they say.”

&gt;Researchers from the State University of Londrina found that people who reported “antisocial traits,” such as low levels of empathy and high levels of callousness and risk-taking, were less-likely to comply with Covid-19 prevention measures, such as wearing a mask and social distancing."
744,Do literally anything to us in an election year and half the country will refuse to do the right thing.
745,What are you even referring to?
746,I’m in Michigan and they’re very much enforced in this part of the Midwest.
747,"I haven’t seen anyone in Costco, Meijer, Kroger, TJ Maxx, Target without a mask."
748,[removed]
749,We had just flown from Colorado to Orlando for spring break.
750,"Arrived March 11th, spent the 2 days at Universal Orlando, watched Trump shut down European travel and wondered how in the hell we managed to travel out of state knowing things were rumbling."
751,Supposed to do a week at Disney right as they were closing but just fumbled through another at Universal and rented a car to get home without having to fly again.
752,Still holding big credit with Southwest and Disney World that we will use eventually.
753,How is anti antifa bad and relates to anti vaxers?
754,A bunch of anarchist morons or the BLM doesn't have anything to do with this
755,"Idk about region but here’s the overall country stats that I have bookmarked

https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/testing/individual-states"
756,You got a source for your claim this is the fastest drug through production?
757,There’s a lady who works at my Target who pulls her mask down below her chin every time she says anything.
758,Idiot.
759,Spot on.
760,Yeah it’s not like he flipped 9 states that were red oooh yeah all republicans are racist how scary
761,Wasn't it obvious when people were buying yachts with the pandemic relief funds they got?
762,I actually predict it'll be higher - more like the 650k to 750k range.
763,"For three reasons:

1."
764,Tens of millions are still travelling for Thanksgiving.
765,Household mixing is a very big way for viruses to transmit.
766,2.
767,Black Friday will be absolute fucking chaos this year.
768,Do you really think a virus that many Americans think is a hoax will stop the people from rioting and having full blown fist-fights over a discounted TV?
769,Not only is that going to spread the virus even harder but injuries occurring from these fights are going to overload hospitals.
770,3.
771,We haven't seen the worst of the second wave yet.
772,"As temperatures get colder, this virus is going to spread harder."
773,"I don't believe in the devil, but I have to admit that my first thought upon seeing that photo was that the devil himself could not have concocted better timing if the goal was to assure maximum spread of the virus over the Thanksgiving holiday, when so many of those kids are going to be dining with multiple generations of older relatives."
774,In this article they claim it arrived on a shipment of clothing.
775,"How likely is that, compared to the likelihood that they have some low level of community spread, like almost everywhere else on the planet?"
776,people who are quick to trot out the 'greater good' line are typically those from whom little has been sacrificed or taken
777,I agree.
778,My vacation got cancelled this year so I've had no days off since March.
779,I'm a runner and all my races got cancelled for obvious reasons and I can't even do that.
780,I lost several people and I haven't hugged my nieces since March.
781,I miss so many things.
782,Quarantine sucks big gigantic sweaty monkey balls.
783,But I don't want other people to die because I **HAD** to eat at a sit down restaurant.
784,"Well hopefully if Biden does what he says he will do, student loan will be forgiven."
785,Makes ya wonder huh?
786,Ugh.
787,The millisecond I see more than ten cars in a parking lot for a large store(I do all my shopping right at opening) I'm nope-ing away from that place at warp speed.
788,This is just so fucking frustrating to see people living their best 2020 life while my family has been locked down since school closed in April.
789,Feels like we’re being punished for doing the right thing while the majority of people we know are living consequence free carrying on like life is normal.
790,"Not to brag about *my* neutrality, but I was born in Canada and my first word was ""Eh."""
791,My employer does that too.
792,Can't wait for the anti-vaxers to quit when they announce the Covid vaccine will be mandatory.
793,I have a real feeling they will.
794,I'm pretty sure that I already saw articles about some hospitals already having received the vaccine and just waiting on the approval.
795,Probably the ones that got freezers for the -70°C storage requirement already got it.
796,Other high priority locations will most likely be sent out like you described within hours of approval since they won't be able to store it for months without those special freezers.
797,the blood of the bearded sapien may benefit the goals of the hive
798,[removed]
799,Like right now with a 12% positivity rate?
800,"Definitely the majority of reddit is that way, I would think"
801,I’m surprised you thought this thing would last forever.
802,This sounds curiously like those saying “you can’t live your life in fear” to justifying eating inside a restaurant.
803,Rural communities now are the ones hit hardest with the least amount of resources to contain it.
804,Y’all literally are going to risk some pretty awful circumstances for what would’ve only been a year or two to wait out.
805,Really strange decision making process
806,Exactly.
807,The very ones bitcching the loudest about shut downs are the ones causing them!!
808,"Pure insanity, selfishness and stupidity!"
809,[deleted]
810,Make America a diseased wasteland  2020
811,And the odds are soooo much higher with covid.....
812,America’s don’t give a fuck.
813,I don’t know why people keep questioning why America’s keep doing things to spread Covid.
814,It’s because no one gives a fuck.
815,It’s the same reason our system is a corrupt as it is.
816,No one gives a fuck.
817,The pandemic has shown how  many in the USA are alcoholics.
818,Yeah how many times are western sources going to keep discounting this?
819,"Well, I haven’t been anywhere except work and the grocery store for months, so I would welcome the judgement."
820,I’m also glad I don’t know anyone in real life like you who is blatantly excusing the selfish behavior of others during a fucking pandemic :)
821,[deleted]
822,Apparently not.
823,This whole chain of comments is making me think that's it's wrong to think that being morbidly obese and having covid would be considered comorbidities.
824,But I still think that if you get covid and you're morbidly obese that you now have comorbidities.
825,Is that not true?
826,Edit: Though this is obviously a good reminder that Reddit is not a place to try to learn anything.
827,"Test, Trace, Isolate - I added it to my above comment, thanks."
828,What’s so special about June or July?
829,And now people think a shutdown is worse than mitigating this disaster.
830,"Like, my guy, it's because your congress has abandoned, propagandized you and defunded your education so now you don't even understand you should be in the streets demanding action that every other god damn country did automatically."
831,We are run by corporate robber barons turning this country into a mindless plantation.
832,[removed]
833,I'm sitting here waiting to get my second dose of the shingles vaccine.
834,Not paying one cent.
835,"Actually, that isn't true."
836,Since my insurance covers the shot it costs me about $5K a year.
837,Because we skipped easter and 4th of July to do our part to flatten the curve.
838,But the government didn't do their part to lock things down well enough to stop it or contact trace and enforce quarantines.
839,But even with hospitals empty where I was they kept things locked down enough to kill businesses but not extinguish the spread.
840,And we've been continuously told that a vaccine won't be enough to remove restrictions.
841,So we just all socially isolate forever or what's the plan?
842,I'll be happy to do my part in any plan that ends this crisis.
843,But I'm not going to avoid interacting with a handful of family members when hospitals around me have fewer people in them than normal.
844,What are you observing?
845,The testing arm started in March.
846,What difference does three more months make?
847,We already have nine months of observation.
848,Your sentiment is dangerous and will inevitably prolong the pandemic.
849,"Sorry you have to make this political because you have 0 personality look at all the parties when Biden won New York, Chicago, San Diego???"
850,But I guess that’s okay because you agree with their political views lol
851,So could have Trump actually done anything?
852,"It's not like once you have COVID you have it forever, the virus cycles on two weeks, so couldn't Biden do a circuit breaker lockdown to mitigate spread?"
853,Or are we already creating excuses for Biden?
854,"This might be a dumb question, but wouldn't we likely see the vaccine get licensed to other manufacturers to get it out faster?"
855,And the Republicans were horrified by that.
856,I've started to see this trend of people arguing more or less how several hours wait for the ER is normal.
857,It's not.
858,7 is ridiculous.
859,"4 is too long, and thats what some people consider normal."
860,If this is true you A) need more facilities nearby and B) you need to head to an urgent care unless its not life threatening.
861,"If the ER is literally the only place nearby, its time to write your local representatives."
862,Hopefully Musk aims it at the sun.
863,"America- ""we should make china pay for the virus since it's their fault"""
864,A lot of the US concerns were alleviated because these vaccines have nothing to do with Trumps operation warp speed or the election.
865,Don’t have to worry too much about Germany doing something to help Trump by lying about effectiveness.
866,Virus growth rates aren't exponential either except in pop science.
867,They're gompterz functions.
868,Awh nobody has the will to put forth effort to keep furthermore trying to cancel me?
869,Lul i feel like him thats for sure
870,"You know what, sad to say we are selfish, and don't want to do anything that might inconvenience ourselves in any way."
871,"There's a reason people like "" wide open spaces "" here."
872,So they don't have to get along with their neighbor.
873,"I live in a very diverse part of southern cal, right by a huge population of ""asians""... Vietnamese, Koreans, Chinese...ect."
874,"These folks wore masks long before this whenever they didn't feel good, or there was a cold going around."
875,Because they are flipping polite.
876,"A lot grew up in highly congested areas, where you'd better get along with your neighbor."
877,"All I know is I saw plenty of people masked up, they went to the gym every day, or they walk now every day, they all wear masks and they are all OLD."
878,Obvious that they are doing something right.
879,I figure I can learn by this example
880,How did you make this?
881,Like what programs/tools?
882,[removed]
883,I'm interested in this topic but don't got the time to read through 70 papers of varying quality.
884,Could you give a shorter list of 3-5 papers which you believe are the most compelling in that list?
885,It’s the American way.
886,Muh freedom over your well being.
887,"Freedom has many great benefits and a few really bad consequences...  we like to argue and be opinionated, we get to hate our leadership and tear them down daily with jokes and memes while hollering at them how WE think they should be doing their job."
888,"Believe me, freedom of speech is a tricky one when you have to listen to these assholes."
889,Freedom is tricky when freedom of speech comes in direct conflict with public health advice about controlling a pandemic.
890,"My mother always said, YOU CANT LEGISLATE MORALITY."
891,And she taught us the old “Golden Rule:” do unto others....  you all know that one.
892,"But none of that has to do with being patriotic OR American, now does it?"
893,It is the character of America that is the problem.
894,The “freedom” over love virus that is inflicting so much pain and suffering.
895,"No amount of legislation is going to change those who are rotten at the core, and especially those who believe their rottenness if justified and encouraged by their pastor and God."
896,So stop all the shouting.
897,"Stop playing into their love of hate and noise and live life with perseverance to protect others where you can, take care of those in your communities, get off your device and volunteer, and vote."
898,Vote like your life and true democratic freedoms depend on it.
899,Show up for those who are fighting injustice at the school boards and public meetings.
900,Be present for your communities.
901,Love and action always wins over hate and noise.
902,"Where I live, positive results usually get priority."
903,So positive should actually come back earlier.
904,"But if the meat is cooked properly, that will kill the virus, right?"
905,"Yes put these ""farmers"" out of business"
906,Yeah they were so scared they voted him into office back to back lol
907,"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/

Look at the daily new cases with the 7 day averaging on."
908,Looks like exponential growth since late September.
909,[removed]
910,Maybe because he's not a scientist?
911,He's just a guy with a lot of money.
912,"This bizarre public fantasy that he's like, I don't know, designing rocket boosters and electric engines is idiotic."
913,He.
914,Just.
915,Has.
916,Money.
917,He's not an engineer.
918,"&gt; They just want America to sabotage ourselves

agent orange is doing a wonderful job of that on his own tho

doubt he needs the assist from pooh bear"
919,[removed]
920,3 mos seems too short IMO or we'd be swamped with re-infections given that we're 8-9 mos into this.
921,It's possible people were infected back in March and are now getting it again.
922,It's also possible that we really don't know since testing was pretty shit back in March.
923,So scary.
924,Other folks freedom ends where mine begins.
925,We ALL deserve for this to decrease and to be safe.
926,"We, the people, of the USofA...are the village idiots now."
927,You my friend have got it figured out.
928,As long as we have fair and free elections this is the path to a better and more free world.
929,But Trump said we have an unlimited supply and it’s free... what gives?
930,/s
931,Again.
932,Why is it selfish?
933,If all those traveling only come into contact with the people that are traveling all those people have entered into the same social contract.
934,“We have decided to travel despite the risks.
935,"Our families also know the risks”

Everyone not traveling won’t come into contact with them."
936,That’s how this works eh?
937,Wont take that long.
938,This doubling took 18 days.
939,We have time for two more doublings to new years.
940,🇺🇸 ❤️ Rona
941,Thanks.
942,I recall hearing a similar explanation now back in the fall.
943,It makes sense that the supply chain can’t be changed so easily.
944,"""being frugal is no longer the effective lifestyle it used to be."""
945,You don't have to fake cry at me to make fun of my point.
946,"I also didn't say ""late stage capitalism."""
947,Everyone knows how much more expensive housing is.
948,Everyone knows how much more expensive education is.
949,"Simple frugality cannot save me, I've done the math over and over for my household budget."
950,"Food, entertainment, and some luxury costs are the only thing that can be cut."
951,"House, taxes, medical are just fixed and make up most of my budget."
952,"If you think stopping my audible subscription and getting books from the library is going to really help me build wealth and retire early, you're just wrong."
953,"300,000 dead by Christmas is a go"
954,"Yes .. but again, there is nothing I can do about other people."
955,I can control only my own life.
956,If they are going to be irresponsible .. i am not going to go out and counter-protest .. i am going to stay home far away from them.
957,Because it's as simple as staying home while the entire country (NOT world) becomes more braindead around you and makes your existence 1000x more dangerous while you receive no government help?
958,You are exactly right.
959,"Also, as you can probably tell, running short on food would be a nightmare for me."
960,"My mother always wants to bring the stuffing, but she brings a tiny casserole dish of it, the same one she made it in for our small family when we were little."
961,So I have to make more anyway.
962,"It’s easier to just do it all myself, because I don’t want to be the rude controlling asshole who tells people how much they need to bring."
963,"Right, they did, and people were getting arrested over Facebook posts"
964,"&gt; Each place took different approaches

Not really."
965,"&gt; we'd probably be following Africa, India, and Brazil."
966,These places are perfectly covered.
967,Use the search engine.
968,Being right for the wrong reason is basically being wrong.
969,"You understand that, yeah?"
970,America is such a nation of over-entitled whiners and hypocrites.
971,Unfortunately the half that are morons have to drag the rest of us down with them.
972,Let's hope you aren't judged the same way you judge others.
973,Your thinking is cruel &amp; inhuman.
974,You should fucking give a shit because we're all fucking human.
975,There's nothing 'clearly' about any of this.
976,I'm glad I don't know people like you in real life.
977,"Yes, it actually does."
978,Thanksgiving is a big holiday.
979,This was always going to be the biggest test of people’s willpower.
980,"And honestly, I get it."
981,"I’ve been super responsible this whole pandemic, but I fucking *love* Thanksgiving."
982,It’s my favorite day of the year.
983,And my family is going ahead with their normal dinner no matter what I say about it.
984,"I know how dumb it is to have a big dinner right now, but this is the first event all year where I’ve been tempted to just turn off my brain for a day."
985,Interesting that you all got sick within 24 hours.
986,"That means you most likely got infected all at the same time a few days (\~4-5) before symptom onset, because if one of you caught it first and then gave it to everyone else at home, there'd be a delay of about 5 days between the first one getting ill and then the other three."
987,"""Can't happen to me!"""
988,🤠
989,Not a whole lot of people I can empathize with any more.
990,"Apart from work(truck driver) and supply runs here and there(groceries for myself and cat), I've been staying away from groups and most other people since March."
991,I still have a few friends in other states that aren't taking any of this seriously and our phone arguments sound like that of the bickering couple.
992,(them telling me why I should go out.
993,Myself telling them they should go kick rocks.)
994,"I imagine that once whenever all of this is finally brought under some form of control, it's just going to be myself and my cat."
995,Probably switch back from home every night and back over to 3-4 nights out regionals.
996,"Only other people I encounter being dispatch and the shipping clerk at same, one or three milk plants I deliver to."
997,"Might also see about working towards my private pilot license as a new set of ""loner hobbies"" to take on."
998,I was barely coming out of a shell for several years before this year.
999,The pandemic has more or less made me back-step significantly into becoming a socially distant monster once more.
1000,Got to embrace the suck.
1001,I can't do shit about that .. the only thing I can control is my own life.
1002,"And yes .. if i break a leg, it matters."
1003,That is why I am staying home .. and also reduce the risks of having an accident outside.
1004,"With everyone doing the right thing being essential to overcoming COVID-19 and some people refusing to comply with CDC guidelines, America is inevitably in for the worst period of the pandemic!🤦‍♂️🤦‍♀️💔👩‍⚕️🚑"
1005,Unfortunately that bus had long left for USA.
1006,The only chance for USA to go with China solution was when NY was in first wave.
1007,"Seal off NYC like they did Wuhan and do testing, tracing and quarantine everywhere else."
1008,That was the only window that USA had.
1009,"I almost had to beg my parents to cancel their trip to Puerto Rico on December 26th, I even got my mom to cancel a Thanksgiving dinner (I believe she only invited my brother and sister, but still, absolutely not) and I'm opening her up to the idea of cancelling Christmas (I think it was my brothers and sisters, but of course, absolutely fucking not) and she's saying stuff like ""oh well come on it's Christmas!"
1010,"They can just eat in the back porch blah blah blah"" but I'm going to get her to cancel it, I just need to work on it slowly."
1011,"I just want to say my parents are extremely careful and take every precaution necessary, never going out unless it's for necessities and when they do go out it's with masks/gloves/sanitizer/the works."
1012,"I honestly think they've just had enough and figured just one time for the holidays with a couple family members would be okay, but why take the risk?"
1013,When a vaccine is so close on top of it?
1014,"It genuinely feels like a full time job taking care of my family and keeping them informed, idk what would happen if I weren't here."
1015,"My brothers and sisters clearly didn't find a problem with coming over for the holidays, what the hell would have happened if I hadn't moved back in with them this year?"
1016,I guess that's my glass-half-full way of looking at moving back in.
1017,I don't understand why those jobs aren't being pushed into the public eye more.
1018,"Temperature is part of seasonality, both in the way it drives people indoors and the affects it has on droplet transmission."
1019,"&gt;Cold temperatures lead to drier air, which may dehydrate mucous membranes, preventing the body from effectively defending against respiratory virus infections."
1020,I'm not even sure where to start in that mess of a word blob.
1021,"For one, not only cases, but deaths are also increasing and hospitals are starting to feel it."
1022,"Secondly, it doesn't really matter what the guy on reddit thinks about China, but life there is back to normal because they took measures needed to contain it."
1023,Can someone explain this?
1024,Is Moderna a part of warp speed?
1025,Did Moderna get tax money to make the vaccine and is now charging again for the vaccine?
1026,Freelancers without employers who live directly from their income needed to pay back some of the aid because aid is only for expenditures.
1027,So if one has less expenditures but use mostly their income for living they almost got nothing in Germany.
1028,Small businesses struggle much more than medium sized ones.
1029,A Democratic society lives and dies by the capability and pragmatism of its people.
1030,"Education is critical enough that I’d liken it to Food, Water, and Shelter, because the government isn’t able to function at its most effective without."
1031,"Ideally, Europe and America should work toward a cultural shift that emphasizes education to the point of reverence."
1032,"Knowledge provides civilians power, which can then be exercised via voting."
1033,Makes me glad I'm 50 and boring.
1034,"If there are individual sellers are operating in the black market, might as well make N95 masks require a prescription."
1035,"Doctors will not like it, pharmacists will not like it, but it would bring some order to the situation."
1036,The 1920s post Spanish Flu and war say differently.
1037,People are gonna go wild.
1038,I wish I had your optimism.
1039,Look at the amount of people traveling for thanksgiving.
1040,Isn’t thanksgiving travel only down 10% from last year?
1041,I work in medicine.
1042,"I have seen nurses go about their lives taking no precautions - going out, eating at restaurants, having kids come home for thanksgiving and going out to eat after they arrive by air."
1043,of course some of the attendings are engaging in this too.
1044,"It seems much more common both at work and among people I know outside of that, but this is anecdotal."
1045,With these results being from people infected a week or so ago we need to wait more days to see where we are really at today.
1046,True.
1047,I just read about genetic tracing and it’s really interesting.
1048,Thanks for the clarification.
1049,"5 bucks at the grocery store gets you an entire already cooked rotisserie chicken, just saying."
1050,I think a lot of the problem is that since so much of the right has moved away from cable news and gets all their info from... questionable sources... that they don't even really understand what's being asked of them.
1051,"One of my friends (who just moved to the midwest) says people are saying ""they want us to wear masks FOREVARR!!"""
1052,"Which SHE (because she's smarter than these people) assumed meant as the only way to avoid covid, which even with the vaccine will likely BE here forever (but nowhere near the threat that it is now) but... she didn't get it."
1053,The masks she had wouldn't protect her while she's pregnant working in a nursing home.
1054,"People think if they're not afraid to get it, what's the point?"
1055,And of course those who have already gotten it and expect everyone to just be comfortable with them...
1056,"But the truth is, the CDC didn't even recommend the concept of using masks as PPE until the last month or so."
1057,"If we had done that from the beginning, there was a chance at relative containment."
1058,"It's truly not about kindness or virtues and I'm honestly sick of that narrative... it's literally to slow shit down so the hospitals don't get overcrowded (yes, it hasn't happened in a while, but with the way things are looking now it looks like with winter it's gonna get worse...)

The people who live in these areas have a high distrust for the government, and the media in general."
1059,I'm in the northeast... in the more rural areas around it's no different.
1060,These people just aren't as connected and for the most part they're fine with that.
1061,Exponential growth my friend.. it's not going to be linear.
1062,If we do not change the way we behave.. 1 million cases a day .. why not ..
1063,My days of eating uncooked chicken have come to a middle.
1064,"&gt; Ok, let's reduce taxes and get rid of healthcare."
1065,"Might as well get rid of education

""This, but unironically""

-America"
1066,Bro the density of Seoul is insane.
1067,You're tired of an argument that's actually factual?
1068,Lmao
1069,Christ this is one of the most ignorant posts I've ever read on Reddit.
1070,Staggering lack of education and knowledge about the world and recent world history where the East has had to deal with multiple outbreaks over the past 30 years.
1071,But what's almost embarrassing is how you go on and on spouting your bullshit so arrogantly.
1072,"It's easy to see how the US lost a quarter of a million when you read these miserable excuses for political, social and community failure in the world's richest country."
1073,I had hoped your excuse might be that you're very young but deep down I know that you are not.
1074,But it doesn't affect me so why would it matter!
1075,!
1076,I pay taxes in America and Canada because my business is split between the two.
1077,And I can tell you.
1078,That my American taxes are more.
1079,In every tax Bracket I've been in.
1080,And the amount I can deduct is less in america.
1081,And cost to actually file cause it's way more complicated in the US so the accountant charge more to do it.
1082,Im not in the Military.
1083,But my point is the Military has the logistical capability to do this
1084,"About how long between your first vaccination until you are ""officially"" immune from the virus?"
1085,"Even with 1 million a day, it should take another year to infect every one and reach Herd immunity."
1086,South Korea actually has a very large population.
1087,They handled this very well from the beginning wirh mass testing and contact tracing.
1088,This is rad.
1089,I was wondering and looking for this exact thing the other day looking at NYTimes data.
1090,If you have more time to think and work on it..
1091,I wonder if you could drop it down to county level data because I'm seeing outbreaks in our state where rural counties now seem dramatically higher in per capita.
1092,"Rounding up to the state level doesn't fully capture (in math terms) that the rural areas seem to be getting hit substantially harder, probably due to mask mandate and social distancing being so political."
1093,I agree with your premise that it shouldn't be political too.
1094,I think how to visualize this is to split each state bar horizontally red and blue to show which factors each state add up to the whole state's % compared to each other.
1095,Here's my terrible text explanation of the graph bar for one date.
1096,"[RRRRRRRRRRRRR|BBBBB]
    
Then a later date

    [RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR|BBBBBBBBBB]

Just a thought."
1097,Cool site.
1098,Your ancestors and founders of your nation would shake their heads in disgust.
1099,The rest of the world looks at you with pity.
1100,Some laugh.
1101,American exceptionalism needs to be wound back.
1102,Or Heroin.

1127,"They really won't budge about not having holidays this year,we will have family coming over from other states; wish me luck and I'll see you guys if I survive winter."
1128,"There is no herd immunity without mostly vaccinated people in the herd, to create a herd of immunity to blunt the spread."
1129,Spread without a vaccine is just a plague.
1130,"My fiancee, while not technically a healthcare worker (works in food service at an elderly living facility), has been told she will be required to receive the vaccine."
1131,Weird that that they aren't requiring you to get it since you're an actual healthcare worker.
1132,Some people in the US see one article or news report of Melbourne in lockdown and decide the whole country has been living like that all year and will continue to do so for the rest of the time the virus is around.
1133,They fail to realise most of Australia has been living a normal life for quite some time and Victoria has now joined them.
1134,We don’t have to worry about infecting our loved ones or overwhelming our health care system.
1135,Where I live we haven’t even been asked to wear masks unless it’s to get tested or go to the doctor because there hasn’t been any recorded cases in so long.
1136,My wife and I had it.
1137,My sister and her husband had it.
1138,We still decided not to drive to our parents house for thanksgiving.
1139,It’s not easy to be so far apart but we have to do what we have to do.
1140,My grandfather died this past spring and we found his old ration stamps from WWII while going through his things.
1141,We laughed at the thought of Americans today having to sacrifice anything like that.
1142,"We can’t even stay home and wear a mask to protect someone’s life, we’re not capable of uniting against a common enemy anymore flit means we have to give up any comfort."

1145,If only more people in these hard-hit areas had the power to tell their covidiotic neighbors that.
1146,:(
1147,'Same here.
1148,"If a vaccine/any vaccine is approved by regulatory bodies here in England, then I'll do my own research and providing the risk is outweighed by the benefits then I will get a jab."
1149,"I don't expect a vaccine to be risk free, but at the same time I have no desire to take a significant risk."
1150,"I was reading a summary of Pfizer/BioNTech trials in the Washington Post, and I'm not close to it so I'm simply repeating what was said in the article."
1151,"By their account only 100 children were included in the trials from start to finish, all between the ages of 12-15."
1152,On that basis I think it would be irresponsible for any parent of a young child to put that child forward for a jab without doing a boat load of research beforehand.
1153,"I was listening to a scientist/vaccine type person on Radio 4 the other day, and he claimed that any safety issues with a new vaccine are generally known within 2 to 3 months of uptake by the population."
1154,"If he's correct, then by the time the vaccine gets to me any safety issues will have seen the light of the day, and the irony is that the very people we are trying to keep safe are those who will be exposed to safety risks by being at the front of the queue for the vaccine."
1155,Excellent communication from the VIC premier too.
1156,Early on he likened it to a health bushfire.
1157,He used the analogy of fighting all the ember attacks in the suburbs when he began the testing blitz at the start of the lockdown.
1158,This sort of messaging motivated the community to pull together.
1159,Thanks for this.
1160,I'm in California and I feel like I'm taking fucking crazy pills with these mother f@#$ers.
1161,And it's not just young people: it's mostly these fucking people in their forties and fifties who are posting pics of them either going out every night or having little house parties constantly.
1162,We are so fucked.
1163,"Abhorrent experimentation by the US government (*coughcoughcough*Tuskegeesyphilisexperiment*coughcough*) is also why tons of Black people in the US are super-wary of getting a COVID vaccine, even with tons more Black people landing in the hospital and/or outright dying due to the virus than members of most other demographics (notice I said **most**, not **all**) in the US."
1164,"Good job, US government!"
1165,You've managed to kill people's trust in you to not use science to make them sick!
1166,Are you serious?!
1167,Can you find a YouTube link?
1168,I almost can't believe people are so damn stupid.
1169,Video report includes clip of attack https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmYFvq21XAk
1170,Synopsis: We're fucked.
1171,My birthday (11/21) ended at midnight today.
1172,"Looks like I may be ""alone"", but not alone."
1173,"Also a ton more time in the direct Sun, people in general spend time outside."
1174,"Im in South Africa we have all worn our masks since this began with hardly anyone being an idiot about losing their freedoms, also we had a hard lockdown that was well over 6 weeks and wrecked our economy but we didnt act like babies, it was needed for the grewter good."
1175,We will come out of this better than the west countries (well that's if they dont fuck us over and prevent us getting the vaccines when available)
1176,Depends on when he was told to keep quiet.
1177,"If the national government was planning the lockdown for the whole city and province and getting the pieces in place to lock it down, telling him to not say a word would make sense."
1178,And there were lots of conflicting information regarding the disease early on.
1179,"So, it doesn't bother me that he wasn't allowed to disclose information without permission."
1180,"As far as I know, the local health authorities were mandating masks and telling people to stay indoors by that time."
1181,"Also, i read some rumors that when the second national health team visited Wuhan, they confirmed that H2H transmission was happening, the report also mentioned that the local government officials were hiding something."
1182,"So, I have the feeling, if this was true, the national government officials were like.. we know you were hiding this, I highly suggest you keep quiet."
1183,We had I think 30 of those conex cooler/freezer combos in my old unit at ft Carson.
1184,They saw no real use state side but where for food use when I was in Iraq.
1185,One could easily think they’re driving in circles because of that fact.
1186,"If Coronavirus were capable of getting *inside a chicken egg*, unassisted, we've got other problems."
1187,I hate that this question delved into who deserves it most.
1188,"For real, frontline workers, fuck yes, or we can’t fight this shit for real if they all get sick and die."
1189,Y’all only care about yourselves sometimes and it shows.
1190,"I had 2 tests done, the rapid at urgent care and the PCR at th ER the next day."
1191,Urgent care informed me of the false negativity rate before they checked me in.
1192,Had xrays done at both and both were negative.
1193,They gave me a z-pak and prednisone plus and inhaler which worked wonders.
1194,It turned out to be a lovely drive!
1195,They they are protesting for elections (which were suspended on account of COVID) and the original protest was due to a criminal extradition bill.
1196,So in pure legal terms they do still have a great deal of liberty but Beijing’s new security law may threaten that security in practice - so you are correct in this regard.
1197,It’s almost a foregone conclusion that they will continue to lose rights in the years to come.
1198,Their right to free assembly and local elections have already come under attack by the new law.
1199,But you are still conflating democratic elections with civil liberties.
1200,"They are related, but not exclusionary, concepts."
1201,The example with Trump is because this is a democratic country and he is a wannabe autocrat - this assertion is fact and shouldn’t be controversial.
1202,Italy and Germany were both democratic countries prior to Mussolini and Hitler.
1203,"By contrast, Russia and China were not democratic prior to Stalin and Mao."
1204,Hence my comparison to Trump.
1205,A previous employer of mine paid for everyone's shots even if they didn't have the company's offensively expensive insurance.
1206,His logic was that it was cheaper than having people call off with the flu.
1207,"So I guess the cost there was to have a job, but I kind of needed one anyways."
1208,The US really reacted with a beige alert
1209,Perhaps not.
1210,But the article is looking at democracies in the East for comparison.
1211,"South Korea, etc."
1212,Yup I know.
1213,Had to pick up a friend from a quarantine hotel not long ago.
1214,"No need to apologize for skepticism, it's a rarity these days."

1220,At what point do the numbers stop going up because that is the maximum testing capacity?
1221,Or maybe you’re right
1222,go on any local subreddit
1223,The level of ignorance in the post is staggering.
1224,Because it’s not like there aren’t 50 million people traveling at any time.
1225,And surely nobody from the other countries are traveling either.
1226,This article is just looking at a specific demographic to fear monger.
1227,"“Just one more holiday man, how can you be so selfish!?"
1228,"?, yeah we have ten vaccines now but there were four cases last month we have to get to zero.” Thanksgiving 2025"
1229,I lived in Florida for almost 2 years and I can tell you for a fact that the entitled people aren’t just coming from out of town.
1230,Florida is by far the most entitled place I have ever been.
1231,Just old rich assholes who think the world revolves around them.
1232,"How poetic that a few years ago we all watched anxiously the marketing of Winter is Coming and now... well, it’s truly here."
1233,"Eh, if you get enough deaths from disease you will cause war and violence."

1235,"And no, Obama could NOT have passed socialized medicine then."
1236,Break wind
1237,"I'm sorry, why are you defending China?"
1238,"They had been investigating this virus since December or earlier, and consistently fed misinformation such as it came from a wet market."
1239,"Seriously, why defend China?"
1240,Imagine if we hadn't banned smoking in most restaurants and public places and fought to reduce the number of smokers year over year.
1241,: /
1242,Well if our leadership ( HA) wont stay put or lead by example....
1243,The benefit/risk ratio for vaccinating children is incredibly lower than for vaccinating at-risk adults.
1244,It's no surprise that studies aren't far along in kids
1245,A complete quarantine from last exposure to another human being for 14 days negates the need for a test at all.
1246,"Should you been infected on your last exposure taking into account a 3-4day incubation period, by day 14 you would have been isolated for ten days and therefore not infectious."
1247,No need to test at all.
1248,It makes money.
1249,"UAE requires testing in order to *leave* the country, among with many other situations that require testing."
1250,Testing just gives you one more clue as to what might be going on.
1251,It really needs to be done in conjunction with quarantine.
1252,Any of those polls were done AFTER the first phase III results?
1253,"I think the numbers ought to have changed, and they will probably keep increasing as people think they have has enough testing."
1254,100% false
1255,"Wow, people doing a better job than Thanos ever did."

1257,McDonalds ditched their artisan chicken sandwich and I am still not over it.
1258,What could they possibly have going on thru December 9th that’s more important right now?
1259,"I mean, bump this one up to the front of the line, please."
1260,"I'm pretty sure that the minister of health said that there is no indirect ""mandatory"" vaccination."
1261,I'm not sure how they will do that since they bought vaccines for 3 million people...
1262,None of that skill is useful for delivering frozen vaccine glass vials.
1263,But hey.
1264,You’re cool.
1265,I get it.
1266,I don't think testing abilities would be able to even show that.
1267,I think we've about hit our daily cap.
1268,The West likes to think itself as a bastion for individual choice and individual rights.
1269,"Looking at the facts on US prison detention rates or the UKs response to NI in the Troubles, or France and Algeria tells you the reality is something quite different."
1270,The UK currently aiming to repeal the Human Rights Act and take it's military out of the frame.

1273,This guy looks like the evil rich villain from a generic tv show
1274,There is always a chance that people who were asymptomatic will wake up one day and have a blood clot working its sway to their brain.
1275,People may continue to die from this even after pandemic is over.
1276,I'm pretty sure a vaccine that's temperature controlled and GPS tracked would be delivered better than your run of the mill amazon package.
1277,"Looking at North and South Dakota's death rates, why the hell does it matter what the population density is?"
1278,It appears the stupidity density is far more relevant.
1279,I’ll report back if I can remember.
1280,And neither of them effective enough to definitively say you don’t have Covid.
1281,Presymptomatic people are rarely likely to test positive.
1282,They usually come up as false negatives.
1283,So compare cases and deaths per capita.
1284,Compare equivalent sized cities.
1285,Sydney and Melbourne are 4+ million people each.
1286,12th consecutive day!
1287,"Swedes are better at following ""recommendations"" than most peoples..."
1288,So that is likely helping a bit.
1289,Sounds like mods were doing their job.
1290,Since when?
1291,!
1292,I get that.
1293,And the right call then is to keep where you live and drive to get food.
1294,"I guess here poor people would move to where there is public transport, into the townships."
1295,The reason why people insist that it's fake news is because that makes them feel good about themselves.
1296,They feel superior to other people because they are not fooled by the government.
1297,"And the deathrate of the disease is not high enough to trigger fear of death in most people, so there is nothing to override that desire for validation."
1298,"And the more they do it, the more focused on that shit they become, which is what leads to strange moments like dying patients denying covid exists even though it's what's killing them."
1299,But those are outliers.
1300,Most people who are pretending covid does not exist will survive this.
1301,And here I am seriously debating if it will ever be safe enough for me to justify grabbing the energy drinks I normally rely on to do my work until like April.
1302,What the hell happened to Kansas?

1306,"If unchecked, it will get to the point that people that could've been saved will die."
1307,"This will include individuals not sick with Covid-19

Where I'm from, non-emergency surgeries are being cancelled."
1308,There are people who are having surgeries postponed that would've improved their day to day lives.
1309,Have you ever considered these?
1310,"This is a once in a century pandemic, and they've already made a vaccine for it."
1311,"It just needs to be mass produced, and enough of  the population inoculated."
1312,Do you really not care about all of this?
1313,Please.
1314,They stopped the WHO from reporting htu transmission until later.
1315,And yes my country has free flow of information.
1316,They wouldn’t have arrested a doctor for discussing it with his colleagues online either.
1317,"I mean, I could link it for you, but the article is in Romanian."
1318,"Anyways, [in case you want to use Google translate](https://www.digisport.ro/fotbal/liga-1/teste-fals-pozitive-la-cfr-cluj-comunicatul-oficial-emis-de-ardeleni-879074)

That was a shitshow really - imagine giving all those anti-COVID / anti-vaxxers the news that a football team (that is actually the best team) just had 23 fake positives."
1319,Pretty much gave them all the arguments they needed not to take this seriously.
1320,"200,000 cases a day just in time to bump the numbers for Thanksgiving, which will give us just enough time to bump the numbers for office Christmas parties, which will give us just enough time to bump the numbers for New Years parties."
1321,"On the plus side, should be able to get Valentine’s Day reservations pretty easy next year."
1322,"Do you think that the Philippines hasn't had 1.2M cases, just that it's been testing that much less?"
1323,The dormitories are the reason Singapore had so many cases: but the testing is the reason they found them all.
1324,False.
1325,Taiwan only repeated what internet was speculating.
1326,That is not document.
1327,I'll be enjoying it with my family.
1328,"Most of which have had it already, because we actually have to work for a living."
1329,&gt; It may be some comfort to Europeans that even the most incompetent European governments seem like models of public-health management compared to the reckless ineptitude of the Trump administration in the US.
1330,But the bigger international picture is far less flattering.
1331,"While Europeans like to think that their societies are the epitome of global sophistication and progress, both their governments and their economies are dealing with the pandemic much worse than China and East Asia are."
1332,"Ouch

&gt; The catalogue of failures is long."
1333,European governments were unduly complacent about Covid at the beginning of the year.
1334,"Having failed to prevent the virus’s spread in Europe, they were then forced into economically devastating lockdowns to prevent hospitals being overwhelmed."
1335,Confinements were then eased before the virus had been fully suppressed.
1336,"&gt;
&gt; Worse, over the summer months when infections were low, governments failed to develop effective mass testing and contact tracing systems that would have prevented a resurgence of cases."
1337,"Now, in the face of a second wave that again threatens to overwhelm healthcare systems, governments are imposing painful new social and economic restrictions every week."
1338,"Ouch

&gt; European societies seem to offer an enviable combination of freedom, security and quality of life."
1339,"But now they are also associated with an unenviable mix of shambolic governance and draconian lockdowns, of creaking public healthcare systems, individual irresponsibility and unnecessary deaths."
1340,Ouch
1341,Only the drivers need a license.
1342,Lab jobs are office jobs.
1343,"Yeah, it really is about the hospital beds."
1344,Once they are filled up the mortality rate from other diseases and conditions not related to COVID will increase.
1345,It is beyond me how most people can not get their heads around this.
1346,One year?
1347,"You deserve the downvote, in that case."
1348,"If everyone else decides to think like you, that's an additional year of death, wrecked economies and despair."
1349,"Do your own research, read about the vaccine science, and then make a decision for yourself."
1350,Don't set this arbitrary timeline of one year.
1351,That’s just not true in the United States though.
1352,"We do  have more than enough food to feed everyone, even despite factory farming."
1353,Food insecurity in the United States is not a result of food shortages.
1354,It’s Fcking sad beyond belief how badly the west has mangled things.
1355,Truly horrific.
1356,"23 false positives, I'd suggest a test on the person who tested the football team."
1357,Perhaps the virus is all from that one person.
1358,"I completely get it, but the same can be said for people who are at risk, they should avoid these types of situations."
1359,"The reality is, you can’t force masks, you can try but you’ll never succeed."
1360,"I’m in Arkansas for work right now, I’d say the chances of someone wearing a mask are 50/50 (says a lot about the people here)."
1361,I’m from NY where it’s the odds someone wearing a mask are 99.9%.
1362,"What I think is that masks should be strongly encouraged, but NEVER forced."
1363,"A decent human being will wear them, a shitty/stupid person won’t."
1364,Then you can be the judge.
1365,Hey wouldn’t know if you’re welcome.
1366,It takes time to investigate a never-seen-before virus.
1367,Do you expect China to instantly know what it is and let you know?

1372,Try middle of December at this rate.
1373,"I just googled it, and sure enough there are even 6 Springfields across Canada too"
1374,"In fairness, Elon Musk has seemed very interested in helping the pandemic and approached this whole thing as a scientist."
1375,I actually just quit my job in healthcare because I was asked to work the day after I had a fever.
1376,Half of my job is doing covid swabs.
1377,Also that missing because I might possibly have covid would give me points and a warning.
1378,"ALSO, if you test positive for covid with no symptoms you're expected to work."
1379,Our covid hospital is at capacity and my co workers are dropping like flies.

1381,Yes.

1384,How motherfuckers think this is a hoax is beyond me.
1385,"Pretend it had a 0% fatality rate with treatment, but required hospitalization at the same rate."
1386,We'd still be fucked.
1387,"Hospitals are still going to fill up, doctors are going to be forced to perform triage medicine, people in car accidents are going to have nowhere to go."
1388,I'm worried about this winter.
1389,"Some people still think ""it's just flu""  Some think they are in a safe age group and don't care about the risk they put others in."
1390,The more interesting question is why do a lot of governments continue to allow those flights.
1391,No it’s absolutely insane.
1392,"They aren’t really planning, they are hoping."
1393,They won’t be any where near low enough numbers to safely open things in early December like they are talking about.
1394,It’s stupidity.
1395,This is the way.
1396,We’re downvoted bc the people DONT like the truth.
1397,DID happen.
1398,"In the initial wave in New York, there were people who had to stay at home with their relative's bodies, some for days, until they could be picked up because of the unexpected and sudden high rate of death."
1399,And that was MONTHS ago.
1400,Do you think we're stupid?
1401,Do you think we're fools?
1402,That’s what I was thinking.
1403,"If we can focus on the economy, we can produce a lot of goods and services to deliver to your dead grandma"
1404,"We don't need an actual lockdown, we just need to close the damn bars."
1405,"But in tangent with that, you need to pay the bar owners and employees but no one wants to do that."
1406,"&gt;We haven't had to deal with an illness like this in over 100 years

And the pathetic thing is they handled it WAAAAAAY better then, because ya know stupidity wasn't nearly as bad as it is today and people actually trusted the medical professionals"

1414,So in short civil liberties are worth more deaths in Sweden than say Norway... From a constitutional standpoint.
1415,That's rather interesting.
1416,"But this don't explain the big popular support for the policies in Sweden, whilst in other very comparable countries they are seen as borderline lunacy."
1417,"Had you asked me before the pandemic started how one would look in Sweden, I would have thought Sweden would have pushed for eradication followed by a Nordic bubble."
1418,The sort of civil discipline you see in Scandinavia would have made that possible.

1423,You're disgraceful
1424,“We’re running out of room.
1425,"Not only for our COVID patients, but for our other acute patients as well."
1426,"So we ask again:  where will these patients go, and who will care for them?” Brown said."
1427,"On Friday, Brown joined the chorus of local government and health care leaders to implore the public to change their behavior by wearing masks, keeping distance and staying home when possible."
1428,"“I know we’ve all heard statements made of how hospitals are not overwhelmed, and our ICUs are not full."
1429,But this is untrue.
1430,And it is misleading.
1431,And I think it provides a false sense of security for our community.
1432,It is not representing what our reality really is.
1433,The reality is our beds cannot be occupied without staff to care for those patients.
1434,"And the beds that are available are full,” she said."
1435,Many of the COVID patients in Springfield hospitals reside in rural counties outside of the Springfield area.
1436,I think it was pretty obvious in my previous comment that governments should at the very least recommend the use of masks in indoor environments.
1437,"Even with a 2 meter distancing rule in place - environments such as grocery stores and other indoor environments with no air circulation are high-risk, even when assuming everyone perfectly follows the 2 meter distance rule."
1438,Laughs in future robot society
1439,I don't know if the US will ever be able to say that regionally again.
1440,Like ever.
1441,"I know things will get better with a vaccine, but we just apparently do not have it in us."
1442,[deleted]
1443,Only need to identify the behaviour patterns.
1444,then vaccinate everyone in those groups.
1445,"Look on the bright side, cases will plateau as testing supplies run out"
1446,One of the few positives about all this has been getting to watch science and technology at work.
1447,"mRNA and adenovirus vaccines, genomic sequencing, large scale testing, statistical models and tracking databases, digital contact tracing/monitoring and even teleconferencing."
1448,In 1918 they didn't even know it was a virus.
1449,This time around we know so much about it.
1450,I also believe things are much better as a result.
1451,The 1918 flu was horrendously deadly and probably spread much more easily due to lack of knowledge and precautions.
1452,It is a shame though that we are doomed to repeat a lot of the same mistakes again.
1453,There is a lot of criticism for Belgiums policy.
1454,Noone is holding up Belgian as model.
1455,"People, including Swedes, are holding up Sweden as a model to follow."
1456,Thats why.
1457,&gt;	At that point we are probably heading into herd immunity.
1458,I don’t believe that will be [possible](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02948-4) without an effective vaccine and near-ubiquitous vaccination.
1459,"Ah yes, the man that made up this whole pandemic story that will eventually chip us with the vaccine."

1461,"they have help trump murder 250,000 americans so far and counting"
1462,I know right... scary shit
1463,"Yes, but how are they measuring this?"
1464,Are they following up with everyone who is positive all the time asking if they have symptoms?
1465,That's a pretty important distinction.
1466,Comorbidity.
1467,_Morbidly_ obese.
1468,"Not a doctor, haven't done the research, but those sound like one might be related to the other."
1469,"They do a verification at 1 month with an antibody test, closest thing to “official” but at 2 weeks should have plenty of antibodies"
1470,Nope!
1471,NW of there about 90 miles
1472,I agree but consider this pandemic a matter of public health.
1473,"You aren't only responsible for you, you do not wear a mask and you risk the health of others, regardless if the others wear a mask or not."
1474,the surgical masks most are wearing are more for protecting others than yourself.
1475,"But, I do think that the damage is inordinately hitting anti-maskers than those who are protecting themselves."
1476,Forcing masks right now seems to be a way to inflame a situation that's already at the boiling point.
1477,Unfortunately France is the country with the highest proportion of antivaxers.
1478,Only 54% even plan on getting vaccinated.

1496,The r0 rate is between 2.7 &amp; 5.7 (depending on which government you cite) that's over the entire period one person is infectious.

1499,Liberals really do feel superior about covid don’t they?
1500,They’re loving every second of this
1501,It's sad that several doctors have gotten accused of falsifying charts by the patient who has covid but doesn't believe in it.
1502,Are flights and airbnbs cheaper than usual and that's why these people are taking the opportunity?
1503,Rebels makes it sound cool.
1504,We need to find something that makes it sound idiotic.
1505,There is no way on the planet I can see this hitting 500K a day in the USA.
1506,No way.
1507,Before it hits 500K something will be done by the pandemic response team + the vaccine should be closer.
1508,"I mean 200K is already crazy, but I do not think 500K will be allowed to happen."
1509,That would just destroy every single thing the US stands for.

1520,It sounds like you are having a rough time with the pandemic and I’m really sorry about that.
1521,"I’ll repost what I said above 

We have a 20 month old and we wanted another."
1522,We live in a rural area and spend a lot of time hiking so the pandemic hasn’t really effected us too much.
1523,(Our state was an early adopter of masks mandates) We just don’t go out to eat or see family/friends but our other activities are relatively the same.
1524,Our jobs let us work from home.
1525,"My wife and I are open with each other about our mental health and actively make sure the other doesn’t get overwhelmed (although, there are days where we both are and that’s a granny babysitting day - who is in our quarantine bubble)

Our logic was - this was always our plan."
1526,Let’s be safe but not let covid stop our lives.
1527,If I sat around and waited for it to be over - that’s a chunk of my life that I wasted and won’t get back.
1528,"Edit: we have also discovered new hobbies, things we enjoy, and my wife and I are closer than ever."
1529,You get to chose how you come out of this pandemic - that’s a choice.
1530,My wife and I chose self-betterment and expanding our family.
1531,Someone told me once to just imagine myself rich and that will work to get me out of poverty.
1532,It has not worked yet.
1533,I mean can it really get any worse?
1534,I’m nearish to the ohio one.
1535,And this was my exact thought.
1536,But Dayton ohio isn’t doing very well with number right now.
1537,Our children’s hospital is now taking adults since the other hospitals a just running out of room
1538,My kid’s daycare is closed all this week and next.
1539,"We have another baby coming around Christmas, so we’re just going to keep our toddler out indefinitely after next week and through our parental leave."
1540,"I’m not seeing any horrific consequences in your rebuttal, or even anything that doesn’t apply when kids are able to be in school."
1541,Teachers and school are hellish for many children.
1542,"If you happen to have a Menards near you, they’ve had a company policy that masks must be worn in their stores for months and at least here have had good compliance with it, they sell masks at the door for $1 and don’t allow you in without one."
1543,But I’d second going early even there too if you *must* go.
1544,"If only somehow we could all just chill for those six months, let science take its course, and then re-emerge in 6 months to a brave new world."
1545,The US is doing really bad and its going to get worse.
1546,France ia also doing terribly.
1547,This pandemic is not the Wests finest hour.
1548,"&gt; People buying lottery tickets: “Hey, ya never know!”

Getting and dying from covid is a lot more likely than winning the lottery."
1549,"No, it is a good thing to think about it beforehand."
1550,"It is not a good thing to apply measures too early of course, but having a plan for the future is never a bad thing."
1551,Guess we'll find out just how dumb the 70 million is
1552,Well I was just days away from getting my visa.
1553,"I had the medical exam on February 25, the interview in the consulate at March 4th or so and would've had my visa about two weeks after."
1554,The interview man said everything was good with my documents.
1555,But on March 11th everything shut down.
1556,"The consulate told me that they can't issue visas for the moment and I should ask them again 30 days later, in April."
1557,"I did, but by then trump had issued the proclamation that denied any visa to be given out."
1558,So my visa is stuck right before issuance the entire time already.
1559,"Mathematically, it makes the most sense for health care workers in nursing homes to get it first."
1560,And they are scheduled to be.
1561,A nurse and a CNA or two oftentimes has an entire wing in their care.
1562,"A CNA gets face to face with nearly every resident on a wing to transfer, toilet, and bathe them."
1563,They may work a wing or two or three in a week.
1564,Either of those two could easily expose 50 or more people in a week.

1568,My husband’s place of employment sends out emails anytime an employee gets a positive covid test.
1569,"He gets at least 3 emails a week, each with 2-5 people."
1570,Been like this since April.
1571,The company masking policy is you only need to wear a mask if you have covid.
1572,You can keep coming to work with covid (even with symptoms!)
1573,as long as you wear a mask.
1574,Our state has a mask mandate but this company donates so much money around the state no one gives a fuck.
1575,"My husband had been WFH since March, but nearly every week his company tries to get him to come back to the office..."
1576,"Please stop, the NYC school positivity rate was .0025%"

I know you are just checking words, and you are very thorough."
1710,But the POTUS IS an idiot.
1711,And people who  support him still are ALSO mindless idiots.
1712,"This unfortunately leads to the conclusion you as bot are both mindless, which is irrefutable, and an idiot for defending a person who let 200.000 people die while commanding the 'most powerful country in the world'."
1713,"Where most people would condemn this savagery and would speak up in all manners and tones your programming is unable to comprehend the stupidity in your choice, and the wish to defend a person who caused 200000 deaths, while little is done to further control of the covid pandemic by ignoring everything and going for yet another game of golf and calling critics Fake News."
1714,The POTUSs actions are clearly childish and retarded.
1715,"Calling him a SUCKER in all the diminutives and curse words is most unbecoming of good taste, morals and etiquette, but when considering the target probably plainly understated.... And you are surely entitled calling me uncivilized and immature, but I do have a concept of the world instead of linear programming."
1716,As such be mindful and consider your decisions and let them be verified by human moderators and be sleuth instead.

1810,What's useless?
1811,Everything?
1812,Are you that person who gets mad when someone using food stamps has a cell phone?
1813,There's several other countries who have higher median incomes than the US.
1814,"Median income doesn't account for cost of living, the proportion of payment to production, or anything else that can offset it."
1815,"If the median income in the US rises by $2000 but everything costs more so the increase is eaten up, then it means nothing."
1816,I'm talking about the various ways people can use their income to be fulfilled.

1829,I can't really explain it any clearer.

1831,The only reason I said anything about the US is because I live here and I can't speak for other places.
1832,"I can't tell if you're mad I insulted America, which I didn't, or because you're not American and somehow that offended you."

1927,Empathised

1929,Same thing in my country (Spain).
1930,"The sentence you quote makes no sense unless you equate ""technocrats"" to ""economists""."
1931,"Because indeed, the West has shown that it is run by economists and their ilk - i.e., dogmatic, indoctrinated, non-scientific short-term optimizers."
1932,"Actually most Eastern countries sound much closer to ""run by technocrats"" than the West to me - and not only since COVID, but before."
1933,"I guess the sentence is nothing more but one more example of Western hubris (""hey, we make technical decisions, unlike those Asian unwashed savages!"")"
1934,which is the main culprit of our situation in the West.

You're already in a more deadly wave than the first one."
1943,That's currently at least another 100k deaths that will pile up.
1944,"These additional people are already statistically dead, you can't do anything about that, they are people catching the disease in the last weeks or today."
1945,The only question remaining is if America chooses to hit the brake hard RIGHT NOW.

1997,Where are they travelling to?
1998,Most countries are closed to tourism
1999,Asians make up 5.6% of the population yet only 3% of the deaths are Asian.
2000,[removed]
2001,"Lol, vietnam is in an infinitely better geographical position than germany."
2002,"There's basically only China, who shut that shit down extremely fast, locked people in their homes and so on."
2003,"And that border is NOTHING compared to the Germany/France, Germany/Austria, Germany/Poland, Germany/Czech, Germany/Netherlands borders and so on."
2004,There are other factors involved too.
2005,"If you truly believe that the only reason why a country like India or Cambodia is doing better than Germany, is that they had a better response you've lost your mind."
2006,Go take a look at how Delhi looks compared to Berlin.
2007,Now think about that officially Delhi has fewer cases per capita than Berlin.
2008,Maaayyybe something else is also going on other than the Indian culture just being superior at handling disease outbreaks compared to German.
2009,"You're welcome to explain how India has fewer deaths per capita than Germany, one of the countries in Europe who are doing best."
2010,"Seriously, try and give an explanation."
2011,"New Zealand also has done better than almost ANY asian country, so maybe there are other factors besides some sort of mystical east asian culture."
2012,It was also with the thought that a vaccine would take at least 18 months (from March) along without knowing risk-production would take place.
2013,This was also when very little data had come in yet to make more accurate predictions.
2014,You have to have an end to the first wave to start the second wave.
2015,Tards are on the rise again.
2016,America is gonna break a million dead to Covid.
2017,"And that's when a vaccine is highly visible on the horizon, they just don't care."
2018,A nation of instant gratification where they'd rather kill their family than miss a big turkey dinner.
2019,This is one of the shittier dystopias created.
2020,People too dumb and too selfish to take any measures to protect their fellow man.
2021,Disgusting.
2022,Fucking stupid
2023,Suicides have been rising in most countries during lockdown.
2024,People *have* died from it.
2025,Give it two weeks.
2026,This will be the story in every major city across the US.
2027,There’s a fucking Tsunami off shore that we can all see coming and there ain’t a thing to do but hunker down if you can.
2028,Or maybe join our shithead prez for a round of golf as the country burns down around you.
2029,I wonder how many ppl are truly happy even without covid-19.
2030,How many families get together and fake it.
2031,Every Thanksgiving my ex husband fought me for a week about not wanting to go to my parents for Thanksgiving.
2032,He hated going.
2033,He hated that holiday.
2034,It was always rough on me bcz my family wasn't the easiest bunch.
2035,So by the time we left it was a huge relief.
2036,The other other side
2037,I am actually grateful I am in Australia during this pandemic.
2038,Other than the shortage of toilet paper for a month or so.
2039,This year  other has been quite normal really.
2040,I haven't felt scared at all to be honest.
2041,'Identity Theft' - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CS9ptA3Ya9E
2042,No i agree with him.
2043,Comparing absolute number and not per capita is really stupid
2044,"So, you guys don't mind if the rest of the world essentially blacklists US passports for the foreseeable future?"
2045,Despicable.
2046,"You are a redditor, stop thinking that you are not among us."
2047,You and op are an XYZ-ologist and think that you have an iq above the median.
2048,"Also, the hospital system will have collapsed by that time."
2049,"It's an the brink of collapsing right now, in a week or two, three the Thanksgiving cases will start piling up... by Christmas people will have to step over the corpses to get to their Christmas parties so to say, by new year's eve it will be a weird juxtaposition of people mourning and people still pretending everything is fine."
2050,But they aren't all 90.
2051,We just lost a 70 year old who had a few more years left in him.
2052,TIL that no one in Australia commutes across states 😂😂.
2053,"Borders between Victoria and the rest of the country were shut down when cases were getting out-of-hand in Melbourne, and this prevented outbreaks on the rest of the country."
2054,More than half the population of the country lives in the 3 largest cities.
2055,Melbourne and Sydney both have around 5 million people each.
2056,Do you think these cities are sparsely populated?
2057,"Strong “No way to prevent this, says only nation where this regularly happens” vibes."
2058,It’s not completely preventable to stop the spread of COVID.
2059,It’s highly transmissible and even people who follow the guidance to the letter can still come down with it.
2060,"What you can do instead is keep the numbers as low as possible by reducing social interactions so that ICUs aren’t overwhelmed, and so you’re not buying 10 mobile morgues to store dead bodies because you have nowhere else to put them, as is happening in El Paso."
2061,If you stop the virus from growing exponentially then you hold out and help health workers manage until the vaccine is distributed.
2062,"However, a significant minority of the U.S. are so concerned with their notion of Liberty that they are unwilling to sacrifice anything, and to hell with everyone else as a consequence."
2063,"These people who want to be around everyone should be forced to take the flu, pneumonia and covid vaccines, no opting out."
2064,"I volunteered my sister's family 1st, calling everyone trying to get everyone to come to Thanksgiving!!!"
2065,!
2066,&gt; And I do agree with the theory that Sweden's divergence from their neighbors contributed to higher death rates next door unfortunately.
2067,What's your sources for this statement?
2068,[removed]
2069,"This is the scenario I could see but people get rather combative when you try to tell them it will happen, (it used to be “could happen” up until a couple of weeks ago, now I believe it will happen)."
2070,They don’t want to let that imagery enter their reality.
2071,So it looks like reality is going to enter their reality.
2072,"How do people have time to test for Corona, when they are travelling, or dont belive in it?"
2073,sorry not native english speaker
2074,There will be those who don't give a **** for the recommendations.
2075,There will be another record shattered :(
2076,so are you sick yet?
2077,"Britain's ""Asian"" is Indian, not East Asians."
2078,Canada shares a massive border with USA.
2079,Can't really compare.
2080,"Not having land borders is an advantage, yes."
2081,"But between Sydney and Melbourne, there's about 80 different roads you can take, and it was all closed."
2082,Not sure how many connecting roads between EU countries...
2083,So what exactly caused you to insult me?
2084,All preventable .
2085,Thank you red hat assholes
2086,"Yeah, that's exactly what I thought..."
2087,"I wish there was a way to convince him, but you can't really argue using logic in this situation."
2088,That's why I was hoping for a really solid source.
2089,"I tried searching for something like ""chance of disease transmission from one vaccinated person to another,"" but didn't get any relevant results."
2090,Probably because it's so self-explanatory.
2091,:/
2092,"That'll never happen, keep dreaming"
2093,Would be sad but not worth the whole world hiding with no end in sight.
2094,It will also be sad when the world economy dies...
2095,50% of the population taking a 95% effective vaccine + whatever % that get infected naturally should be close to herd immunity right?
2096,&gt;well inside of the realm of possibilities I knew I was signing up for when I started my career!
2097,See this is where you were wrong.
2098,We always assumed if a disease spread through the country people would want to avoid it.
2099,"Not be brain dead fucking morons screaming about their ""freedom"" when asked to just wear a fucking mask."
2100,One would think reasonable people would want to AVOID a fucking disease.
2101,We weren't expecting you all to be this fucking idiotic when we signed up.
2102,we aren't doing that much better
2103,I remember when they said that all coronavirus-related content would remain accessible without cost.
2104,So the Pfizer vaccine is the one you want to get right?
2105,The operation warp speed vaccine is not the same one as Mentioned in the article?
2106,"Yeah, anyone having thanksgiving at all likely isn’t taking things seriously."
2107,I’m sorry your relatives are being so stupid.
2108,In a Pandemic?!
2109,😨
2110,what the fuck are these people thinking of?
2111,https://www.insider.com/over-12-texas-family-members-positive-coronavirus-after-small-gathering-2020-11
2112,My uncle pulled that stunt there.
2113,"Went to Publix, got the flu shot, then used his $10 to buy ice cream."
2114,"Well, they've defied it from the start here, I'm in North Dakota, the worst state in the country and according to the data, the worst in the world right now."
2115,"I can tell you first hand that for a lot of people, if the stores aren't making you, people weren't wearing them."
2116,Only now do you see widespread mask usage.
2117,The biggest issue here is that people keep having parties and indoor gatherings.
2118,My opinion?
2119,I think in general distancing and masks work.
2120,This may be anecdotal but it seems rare that anyone I have known or others have known have been sick going to the store or eating out when distanced.
2121,"It's all parties, packed bars, and close contact house gatherings."
2122,"If me and my family get vaccinated, I’m no longer taking precautions."
2123,The anti-vaxxers shouldn’t rely on society to protect them.
2124,LOL imagine risking Covid to watch this shit team...
2125,It would work if the regulations were good.
2126,"Some parts are regulated too much, some too little, overall it's the wrong amounts in the wrong places."
2127,But the an-cap dream of rational people acting in self-interest is long dead.
2128,"There has to be some nanny state, we're only arguing about where and how hard."
2129,No one thinks they're the problem.
2130,They don't realize they're in the crowd they're complaining about.
2131,Things are going to be ugly by Christmas.

2138,"Yes, this sucks, but remember it's temporary."
2139,A year from now this will be so far behind us it will be looked at as a bad dream.
2140,"Newport Beach, CA a.k.a."
2141,Orange County a.k.a.
2142,the Florida of California.
2143,We’re back in the purple tier so I don’t know if the bars there are still open today but just a few weeks ago they were running.
2144,"I mean if covid doesn't entirely annihilate the population, climate change will put a lot of it underwater in a few decades"
2145,I shake more hands and attend more events in a month than you do in a year because of what I do professionally so you can stuff that hot take right up your ass.
2146,"""so you traveled for Thanksgiving and now you want into our hopsital for covid..... """
2147,"While Biden has a much rougher start than trump did, he can do a lot that trump chose not too."
2148,"To start, Biden can invoke the Defense Production Act for all supplies related to the pandemic, can do selective shutdowns where/when necessary, set up rules on what level of covid in a community mandates shutdown of certain activities like indoir dining, etc."
2149,Most viruses in a lab environment are stored at lower temperatures (-80 degrees or lower) than what you would use in a food supply chain.
2150,The military will be loading their M16s with special hypodermic bullets that can penetrate even the most dense anti-masker's hide.
2151,"Which Swedes can and will do because they received free education, enjoy good employment rights, have social security and public healthcare."
2152,"If there's anything Sweden could learn from the US though, it would be to fight for masks."
2153,Yes!!
2154,I am hoping for some miracle so we can get it before March.
2155,My girls both had their parties suddenly cancelled last March and it would stink to lose two in a row.
2156,"Here is hoping their 4th and 6th birthdays will happen with more people than our little immediate family, lol!"

2159,There is an easy solution for this then.
2160,Post the video.
2161,And it better be the EXACT context as what you said.
2162,Spoilers - He never said it would be over by April.
2163,He said he hoped it would be over by april.
2164,Not understanding basic English is WILD to see.
2165,Pretty sure the retailers in the US are just circulating this so that the restrictions loosen up in time for everyone to visit stores in person and splurge the last of this stimulus money and feel safe giving one infections for the holidays as they gather family around for their chosen celebrations.
2166,Then they cue up the 2021 resurgence of infections just in time for everyone to splurge on getting the vaccines so more money can float upwards.
2167,"But then again I have no basis for my feeling other than watching history repeat itself so maybe I should just put my tin foil hat back on and go back to 
r/conspiracies 
..Safe safe humans."
2168,My guess is we’ve detected 3 in 4.
2169,"So around 16’ish million actually infected, or about 5% in the US."
2170,Working in a freezer 8+ hours a day is going to be far higher risk than reaching into a grocery store freezer a couple times a week.
2171,"""Don't worry about surfaces"" is very reasonable at a time when airborne transmission is completely out of control."
2172,They don't need that many.
2173,"One, because more than the mRNA vaccines are in the pipeline and two, not all of those need two doses."
2174,"Ah yes, claiming people who are more likely to carry Covid as being more likely to carry Covid is just as bad as claiming that Jewish people carry various diseases."
2175,what do you mean?
2176,i hope the downward trend continues...?
2177,maybe i worded it wrong
2178,"&gt; why care when 99% of the other people don't give a shit about you

Only because, when the shit hits the fan, I don't want the sociopaths to think I agreed with them in the end."
2179,"I want my ""Told you so""."
2180,Lower cased hospital bothered me
2181,Mankind invented this thing called a straw in vain.
2182,You can lead a horse to water but...
2183,"Well, hopefully this means that they can distribute the virus to anyone who wants it, sooner."
2184,"As other people see that it's safe,  there will be more and more willing to take it and that should coincide with more availability."
2185,It literally is moving the goalposts.
2186,"Because all you want to do in order to push your bullshit narrative is reduce the one out of 250k at minimum, because America is 100% underreporting the death toll, to mere percentages in comparison to the overall population."
2187,We even have recorded proof of our nation's leader calling someone to notify him that he is intentionally downplaying the severity of this virus.
2188,Excess deaths in our nation is up 30 percent due to one fucking cause and that's the virus.
2189,"So when you say, dont look at the number of cases which influence hospitalization rates and in turn death rates, just look at death rates and put your head in the sand like I'm doing."
2190,You dont give a fuck about accuracy you give a fuck about spreading the very false notion that the cure is worse than the disease.
2191,And this is assuming we only have one vaccine.
2192,"There will be more, which will speed up the process."
2193,truly unfortunate.
2194,i pray they can all recover and no one in that family has to live with the guilt of losing another family member
2195,"My money, my choise."
2196,Don't tell me what not to buy.
2197,Nah but if it makes you feel better to think I do then that’s fine.
2198,Do you boo
2199,"I love America, but I hate Americans."
2200,We are a bunch of self-indulgent narcissists
2201,"7/49 and you have 3 numbers for 5$, so the ods are 1/33 000 000."
2202,So about 500 stadiums.
2203,835 vs 28
2204,"Your post was perfectly clear, thank you!"
2205,One thing I’m toying with is optional assignments.
2206,"Students who do my assignments usually get 10/10 (maybe 2-3 points off occasionally, but 95% of them get 100% on each assignment)."
2207,"However, by making assignments optional I’m leaving it up to students how much pressure they’ll have on exams."
2208,"They can do fewer assignments and the exams weigh more heavily, or they can do more assignments and have the exams weigh less heavily."
2209,Bonus because if they have a random stressful week they can easily just skip that one assignment without penalty.
2210,My only hesitation is if I’m too lenient I’ve had students blame me for their lack of preparedness.
2211,In spring semester I kept my same schedule but made everything due at the end of the semester since I knew everyone was transitioning differently... well then I got a bunch of evaluations blaming me for being too relaxed which allowed them to procrastinate which was therefore my fault that they were stressed at the end when everything was due.
2212,And it wasn’t a few isolated students—it was about 20% of them!
2213,I was absolutely floored to receive those evaluations TBH.
2214,"It made me realize that many students do want structure, even if they say they don’t."
2215,"Not sure what Florida did, not sure thay state has as much relevance as China had in this pandemic"
2216,Notice how 1st responders are not out here complaining everyday.
2217,They knew what they signed up for to serve the people.
2218,Teachers and medical workers do the same thing they love to preach how much they love serving the ppl untill they realize they have to do it during a pandemic
2219,"I use to lack confidence, I never really messed up and if I did I was able to fix or correct it, but I still just didn't have that confidence to not double check everything I did,or ask questions I already knew the answer too."
2220,"So I just quit double checking things, quit asking questions when I was sure of the answer, I generally hold an optimistic attitude that's completely lined with anxious failures on the horizon."
2221,"But so far, so good."
2222,"https://m.facebook.com/laredonights/

Don’t act like this is just a flordia problem."
2223,Your friend is being paranoid.
2224,"Once vaccinated, that's the end game...especially if you are already young and low-risk."
2225,Florida just keeps floridaing.
2226,"Fuck, I gotta stop reading more than headlines."
2227,I just bought 3 more racks of TP when I read the title!
2228,[deleted]
2229,I have to wear a mask and safety glasses at one of my part.
2230,"I found that wearing it like a grandma on my nose ([only example I could find](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Ev1l_QJ_uSY/XBwsL9nSacI/AAAAAAAAtJg/vtBje8OhEWQcOhpbCPzf3e6uMMjNAqMRgCLcBGAs/s1600/252.JPG)) gives the eye fog plenty of room to escape 

Undoubtedly it's still worth a shot trying even if they likely don't listen because it'll be in their head and maybe they'll try it and change their minds."
2231,You could ask them if you've heard of our Lord and savior [anti-fog wipe](https://www.google.com/search?q=eye+doctor+anti+fog+wipen&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en-us&amp;client=safari)?
2232,They still won't listen but hey if you haven't tried that yet it could be something..  who knows anymore.
2233,It seems everyone has drank the kool-aid and now we're  seeing the effects of it and it hurts.
2234,It really does
2235,I think compliance is much better than autocratic enforcement.
2236,You'll just have more people openly defying masks and social gatherings and your governor will be begging Trump for a vaccine by December
2237,"First shot, then three or four weeks."
2238,"Second shot, then wait a month for immunity to build up."
2239,To be back to normal in May we’d need to be giving shots to most priorities of folks in March.
2240,I sure hope so.
2241,"If I’ve got recent stats right, only four states have given more tests than their population since this started."
2242,I sure hope rolling this vaccine out goes easier than setting up testing.
2243,And then they ask themselves why they have almost 200k cases per day
2244,Our twice postponed wedding is set for June.
2245,I’m  finally feeling cautiously optimistic that this may actually get to happen in some semblance of how it was originally planned.
2246,How many other people did they kill it injure?
2247,"It's not just those 15 morons, the ripple effect was probably huge."
2248,"I can't force you to be factually accurate, but I can call out your bullshit when I see."
2249,And I did.
2250,"Well, Australia is he size of the US, and if I want to get from Victoria to South Australia I could try walking."
2251,"And when the border was closed, some did try - although they tended to get caught and made an example of."
2252,Island really doesn't make a difference - governance makes the difference.
2253,"And although the Australian federal level has been inept and behind the curve, the state level has generally done a good job."
2254,My ex used to go long periods without exercise and then get all crazy motivated and try to jump back in with a really intense workout.
2255,I would strongly suggest going slow.
2256,"For example, walking around the block a few days, a short jog a few days, some yoga, and then maybe going on a real run after a week or two, but she would get defensive and we would have an argument, and then she would go try to run 5 miles and hurt herself."
2257,When we broke up she acted so hurt that one reason I didn't want to stay together was that she wasn't able to participate in physically demanding activities with me.
2258,"If she had a freak case of cancer, that would be one thing, but it was all preventable injuries I tried to help her avoid."
2259,[removed]
2260,Also frustrating that frivolous air travel is being mixed with necessary air travel.
2261,"My daughter flew home from college and had been tested 2x week, quarantined before leaving and had to pass an exit test but got crammed in with everybody else not taking the same precautions."
2262,Including one person hacking up a lung on one flight.
2263,Literally zero symptom screening.
2264,"All we could do is give her as much PPE as we could, quarantine on arrival and get a test at home."
2265,6 cases is about all it took to initially start the entire pandemic in the United States.
2266,Party go' ers that will be giving COVID to mom/dad/grandma and grandpa.

2629,&gt;Reports are pouring in on a daily basis from Polish ambulance stations and hospitals of patients — coronavirus or otherwise — being taken by ambulance from one hospital to another in a hunt for a free bed.
2630,"&gt;In one widely publicized case, an elderly patient left home in an ambulance, with its crew frantically calling hospitals for the next three hours in search of a bed."
2631,The search ended tragically when the man died.
2632,This is the tragic but inevitable reality of failed leadership during a pandemic.
2633,The health system inexorably collapses if community spread is not managed.

2654,The knowingly part is where all ideologies clash.
2655,"Having unprotected sex if you don't know whether you have AIDS or not is not illegal, knowingly passing AIDS down to your sexual partner is illegal."
2656,It's the same principle with COVID: if you tested positive it should be illegal to socialize w/o a mask.
2657,"If you don't know whether you have it or not, it shouldn't be illegal to socialize w/o a mask."
2658,If you strongly believe that Governments should punish those who do not know if they have it or not but still socialize w/o a mask then you must also strongly believe that Governments should punish those who have unprotected sex.
2659,I know.

2788,Had to be strategic edit to let people know how stupid travelers are....
2789,"Yes, unfortunately it’s somewhat of a catch-22."
2790,The drugs themselves are expensive and dangerous in their own way.
2791,The protective effects (if there are indeed any) might be due to the drug level in the blood of crohns patients when they are first infected with COVID.
2792,Either way I don’t know if it’s possible to treat the general pop with this stuff.
2793,My dose costs me 18k every 8 weeks.
2794,It requires doctor and nurse supervision during the infusion.

2801,If you treat everyone when they first become positive is that even feasible?
2802,"How can we afford that, how many would suffer serious side effects for what could have ultimately been a mild case of COVID."
2803,In the IBD land we talk about risks vs rewards with biologics a lot.
2804,The risks and dangers of unchecked IBD are much MUCH worse than remicade.
2805,Suppressing the immune system obviously has consequences but an unchecked auto immune disorder can ravage the body (and cause cancer itself).
2806,"The goal is always to avoid and delay surgery and steroids, biologics help you do that with a minor cost."
2807,But with COVID.. who knows.
2808,I don’t know if we can compare the risks like with IBD.

2830,I have four people from out of state who want to come visit.
2831,None of them have had COVID.
2832,I don't think we are in danger of catching it again based on how most folks seem to have immunity at least for a while.
2833,"How at risk are they though, if they drive  straight here and hole up in my house for a week?"
2834,My state (Iowa) is absolutely batshit with cases right now.
2835,They have all gotten swabbed and should get results Monday before they leave to drive here.
2836,They are also coming from areas that are heavy with cases.

2848,"Taiwan would have greater world recognition and agreements with other countries that would create a liberal flow of increasing international visitors and workers like Australia as well as incorporate the same issues, which would make its existing covid-19 figures highly unrealistic and more towards the numbers that Australia would have given that they have about the same population."

3301,Beds are already at capacity.
3302,I work for a healthcare system and we were working on shortening length of stay before the pandemic hit.
3303,Thinking about how we can decrease patient stay helps to open beds for those who need it now.
3304,I really hope people reconsider their plans and stay home.

3315,"My husband is a COVID nurse and it’s shocking how often he gets told “it’s a hoax” “it’s not real, test me again” “you’re a liar” while he is literally in a full PPE suit trying to save their lives."
3316,Some patients and family are great but the quantity of patients and family who berate him and the other COVID staff is ridiculous.

3318,Not sure if you're just being facetious but husband flew to help his mom through a severe medical emergency because she has literally no other family or friends.
3319,We're not traveling at all for thanksgiving though
3320,Covid-19 is not comparable to SARS/swine flu - it is way more infectious despite being in the same virus family.
3321,‘Taking our chances and having fun’ will kill a million people.
3322,Our health care system is being overwhelmed in numerous areas while cases continue to increase exponentially.
3323,"Without care the fatality rates in Italy in the spring were closer to 3-4%, rather than the 1%(ish) we’ve been having now that we’ve got better treatments."
3324,Even if Phizer and Moderna vaccines are approved in the next 2 weeks it will still take months to get even half the population vaccinated.
3325,Lets see... first 5 months of the virus in the US: 100k known covid deaths.
3326,Second 5 months: an additional 150k.
3327,"As fast as infection rates are spiking I’m hoping the next 5 months will only be an additional 225k, but I fear it will be over 300k deaths in that time period."
3328,We already know as of oct 1 we’re averaging 1 extra death not tied to covid for every 2 known to be covid.
3329,Thats with less than 1/3rd of the US population catching it in the wild.
3330,did you read the article?
3331,"Sure, but if you walk past someone in a grocery aisle who has it, you're less likely to get it than if your grand nephew who picked it up in class shows up at your house and sits there talking for 6 hours on a Thursday afternoon."
3332,Why is this so hard to understand?
3333,"Even pre pandemic, I would go to Costco mostly close to closing time."
3334,"Fewer people, in and out fast, no lines."
3335,Major downside is you never catch any of the free samples.
3336,This article makes me think of a conversation I had recently with someone who has gone on medical leave from work with no pay due to COVID concerns.
3337,This person has respiratory issues and is considered high-risk.
3338,"What he said to me was “look, I don’t really think that I will die from this virus."
3339,"But I think that if I got it, there’s a real good chance that I would wind up in the hospital."
3340,"And if I go to the hospital, I am bankrupt."
3341,"If I don’t go to work, I am bankrupt."
3342,"But I would rather be bankrupt and healthy than bankrupt and sick.”

My guess is that there are a lot of people who are thinking along these lines and are hunkering down, not really participating in the economy at all."
3343,And they won’t come out until they feel safe.
3344,Apparently.
3345,Thanksgiving.
3346,The ‘ancient’ 244 year old ritual.

3353,That's not quite right.
3354,The polls I saw said 60% of people said they would take it and 20% said they would not.
3355,Also people lie to pollsters and to themselves.
3356,Especially when something is political.
3357,I bet 80% of people end up taking it.
3358,How many do u think will be inflected by COVID’s birthdays
3359,Why do you think the virus is spreading?
3360,Do you know how the virus spreads?
3361,"Do you think the people in power (health officials, scientists, doctors) are wrong or corrupt and lying to us?"
3362,"You think that because you, me and our close friends/acquaintances followed the rules for two weeks and it didn’t work then that means it doesn’t work?"
3363,There’s a scary number of people that didn’t do any of that - ever.
3364,The amount of those people and their consequences renders any anecdotes we have as completely minuscule.
3365,"Yeah, good job on us, but just because a “lot of people” you know on Facebook and read about followed the rules for a month doesn’t mean shit."
3366,This is about a much larger group who never has even tried and has polluted your views.

Good chance it didn't even originate in China."
3371,We'll have to wait and see.
3372,Somehow I doubt China Hawks will stop calling it the China Flu either way.
3373,The issue is not a east west thing the issue is a memory thing.
3374,"The east is just doing what has always been done in the past, in east and west; which is to isolate and quarantine."
3375,"No matter which part of the world you go to, in the past, isolation and quarantine was used in every society."

3388,Our government locked us down but also threw money at us so we could easily comply with restrictions .

3390,I think America feels like it’s too far gone to bother making changes ( maybe it is ?)
3391,but doing nothing isn’t working so you surely have to try something right ?
3392,"There's no agreement as to if ""asymptomatic"" is being used to refer to someone's current status, or to the entire course of their illness."
3393,You have to read the context to determine how the word is being used.
3394,A lot of misunderstandings -- some of them probably deliberate -- have happened because a scientist used one meaning for that word (often which was obvious in context which meaning was being used) and then it was reported as if it was the other meaning.

3630,I got it back in February where my office insisted we were going to continue to operate as usual.
3631,Which would be fine if we werent a new age fucking open office concept but germs just fly EVERYWHERE.
3632,"Working from home now and love it but I do miss my coworkers 

I miss playing soccer and basketball so much."
3633,"Every passing day with no financial support or relief, that old Carlin bit about this country being bought and sold a long time ago by politicians becomes sharper and more true."
3634,"They'll say ""This is so bad, but we couldn't have stayed locked down forever!"""
3635,As if there are only two choices: mass death or a year long lockdown.
3636,"I know, because that's what they're saying already."
3637,Of course they can be.
3638,Do you have any actual data to support it being more than 30% or are you just simping for the US right now?
3639,I don’t understand the increase in cases.
3640,We’ve all had mask mandates.
3641,"When I go out which is not often, I see compliance."
3642,Shouldn’t be political
3643,I've been saying this for years.
3644,"Dems literally want everyone to be able to have maximum liberty to do whatever they want with their lives...except for guns, which we have to control so tightly that we make people felons overnight just for owning an inanimate object."
3645,Meanwhile that's the exact situation we're already in regarding drug possession (catch a felony for owning an inanimate object that's harming no one) and they say it's wrong to create felons over so little.
3646,Interesting how that only works for some things but not others.
3647,If they can easily quarantine then better safe than sorry.
3648,Ruh roh raggy
3649,I also dont buy any argument that shrugs off covid deaths for people who've exceed their life expectancy.
3650,Some people dying of covid in their 70s and 80s may have otherwise lived another decade or more.
3651,"Ironically, even if the only people who died were above the national life expectancy, the life expectancy would still drop because life expectancy is a distribution which, in a sense, is raised higher by people who greatly surpass life expectancy."
3652,Not to mention that the number of people in their 70s that continue to work is increasing and hence you cant discount the economic impact of losing those workers either.
3653,Lol didn't Democrats just spend 4 years talking about how Trump is a Manchurian candidate for Putin?
3654,That's not fear based messaging?
3655,No.
3656,You are false.
3657,Had this been a restaurant he would have easily infected 50 - 80 people.
3658,The fact he only infected 4 is a testament to just how safe airplanes are.
3659,We have zero supply.
3660,That’s the problem.
3661,If people consistently go to the same houses to do school and don't rotate around it can be a closed bubble.
3662,Its a reasonably common model a lot of people are doing right now.
3663,They are often called pods or cohorts.
3664,If we had a real lock down it would end the pandemic much sooner and the economic impact would be less in the long run.
3665,Practically speaking we would have to address the economic disparities to make this happen for everyone.
3666,I for one would gladly give up any stimulus moneys so that another family could stay home and we could get through this faster and more safely.
3667,"&gt; India is one that is doing poorly as well

Okay."
3668,I'm out.
3669,Your definitions of doing poorly are ridiculous and I can't be bothered with you.
3670,Agreed.
3671,Stay the fuck home and stop going inside stores that have drive throughs.
3672,Especially pharmacies and other essential services.
3673,I'm currently in bed with a respiratory infection and waiting on a covid test.
3674,Everyone in my pharmacy is out of vacation time and no one has taken a vacation.
3675,I'm starting to really resent assholes who don't wear masks and come in sick.
3676,Stay.
3677,Home.
3678,Skype your relatives.
3679,You don't like them that much anyways.
3680,I’m a healthcare worker and they’ve actually told us it won’t be mandatory.
3681,Which is odd since we can be fired for not taking the flu or whooping cough vaccine.

3692,Court dates are extremely backed up.
3693,"It will take up to 6 to 8 weeks, if not months, for an eviction court date to be assigned at this time in most states."
3694,I'm going to assume IL is backed up trying to fill in for past cases of every variety that have been delayed.
3695,"I was almost evicted a couple of decades ago and the lawyer we retained, pro bono due to our circumstances with our landlord, told our landlord that it would be several weeks."
3696,We came to a mutual agreement through mediation to offset that circumstance.
3697,"Right now, good luck to any landlord trying to push their case to court."
3698,"There are a lot more pressing needs, cases in this case, that will take precedent before eviction cases."
3699,"I may be wrong, but where I live eviction cases are not top priority."
3700,Thank you!
3701, Nailed it.
3702,We aren’t at risk for severe sickness nor are my parents.
3703,We just want to be responsible.
3704,I’m not leaving the house until we go down there after the test nor is my husband.
3705,People in the countryside are not 'renting a room in a mid sized city'.
3706,They live rent free and almost tax free.
3707,"if your interpretation is true, then almost everyone in China pays 3%-10% tax."

3709,"This is much better news than what the experts claim for the so called experts claim that we will all have to continue on with social distancing, masks, etc..for some time after vaccine is available with no set date in sight."
3710,I prefer what Bill has to say here as opposed to what the so called experts are telling us.
3711,[deleted]
3712,How were the security lines?
3713,It could be argued that younger people should be prioritized as they are more likely to be the ones to spread it.
3714,"If the goal is still to tackle the curve, surely those who are more mobile and interacting with larger groups of people in work or other circumstances should be top of the list."
3715,"Ahh, thank you."
3716,I worked in a laboratory which used LEAN.
3717,It was often the bane of my existence.
3718,Yes there was lol
3719,I don't understand why families want to put each other at risk over a holiday that celebrates being thankful.
3720,I'm thankful that my family is alive and I want to keep it that way.
3721,My elderly parents live 15 minutes away.
3722,My diabetic nephew lives 10 minutes away.
3723,My husband's large family lives 40 minutes away.
3724,We aren't seeing any of them for the holidays.
3725,We're staying at home with our dogs.
3726,it doesn’t
3727,Logic.
3728,Hopefully your fellow Americans won’t get to them first.
3729,"That is world wide, we were talking about infections in the USA"
3730,Germany could have been even more effective to weather the pandemic had neighboring nations followed similar protocols.
3731,"Sadly, America’s poor example of mixed messages did affect how many Europeans perceived public health advice."
3732,"If distancing and mask mandates were accompanied by fines, and enforced (as the were in some countries) it would have reduced the spread."
3733,"Now, several European countries project being able to vaccinate their citizenry by February."
3734,"Clearly, those nations with a better coordinated public campaign fared better like South Korea, Australia and Japan."
3735,bUt IsN't ThAt SoCiAlIsM!#@!!?

3737,I'm case anyone wants to see the [video](https://twitter.com/Max_Gorden/status/1329945642026684418?s=20) but not the news site
3738,Yeah workfare is bullshit.
3739,I don't mind voting tactically every election.
3740,"I just want the Republicans to get dragged left so the Democrats can afford to actually be left and still win

Or maybe the Republicans will outflank them and flip back to ""The Lincoln Party""."
3741,"But as long as their voter base is... what it is, I can't see it."

3746,Hospital police.
3747,Skeleton crews in other medium essential places.
3748,As many as possible.
3749,Of course entertainment places should be closed.
3750,Why is this even a discussion.
3751,Do you want it to just keep spreading.
3752,Australian here.
3753,I can’t comprehend how some Americans aren’t completely horrified about the current situation.
3754,"I am so sorry you are all dealing with this, my thoughts are with you."
3755,"Yes, March should be much better if these vaccines are effective and we have a good amount of the elderly  vaccinated."
3756,Light at the end of the tunnel!
3757,Sure does.
3758,"""It is what it is"""
3759,"Yup, we have a lot of people here in California who are going to travel despite being one of the most infected states."
3760,These idiots are from both sides.

3762,Perfect thank you!
3763,Just like the original Thanksgiving
3764,Good internet across two different devices and this site was a trainwreck on both.
3765,The US has literally no control of our borders.
3766,There are 12 million illegal immigrants in our country and some years hundreds of thousands cross over.
3767,You’ve been invalidated
3768,"I honestly don’t understand the mask hatred , yeah it makes your face hot and your glasses fog up but it protects you ."
3769,"It’s just like a seat belt or bike helmet , it’s for you to protect yourself ."
3770,I’m kinda surprised selfish people aren’t for them .
3771,Westerners in January/February: Asians are more prone to diseases because &lt;insert reasons here&gt;.
3772,The West will be fine.
3773,Westerners now: Asians have natural immunity to COVID because &lt;insert reasons here&gt;.
3774,"No joke, there was a professor (a Westerner) who tweeted about Asians having natural immunity from COVID due to some diseases that hit the region thousands of years ago."
3775,Lots of people called him out though because this doesn't explain why Asian Americans have been hit hard.
3776,He has since deleted his tweets.
3777,"Seriously, how hard is it for Westerners to admit that they completely messed up their pandemic response?"
3778,What's with all these lame excuses?
3779,I’m a RN on a covid unit and most of my coworkers do not want to get the vaccine.
3780,Neither do I.
3781,"*Presently*, you can't be denied coverage for pre-existing conditions."
3782,"There is a SCOTUS case (oral arguments on this were almost 2 weeks ago) working through that could shake things up, but it is still being litigated so that's up in the air."
3783,"...aaaand at 200k new cases a day it'll hit 13 million in less than a week, maybe 14 if people don't smarten the fuck up and stop traveling

SMH"
3784,India is one that is doing poorly as well.
3785,"So look at Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam, Korea, China, Laos, Cambodia, Malaysia..."
3786,My local grocery store had lots of capons on sale alongside the turkeys.
3787,"They're bigger than a chicken, smaller than a turkey, so a good size if you want to cook a bird for a single-family gathering."
3788,From arizona you can see we went up and down 3 times if you look at a graph.
3789,"I admit, I have my moments where I feel like this will never end and my anxiety makes me crash, but if you look at every pandemic in history, they all ended eventually and most of them with no vaccines or treatments."
3790,We are lightyears ahead in terms of science now and the fact that we're talking about vaccines rolling out in the next 1-4 months is incredible.
3791,There is a light at the end of the tunnel.
3792,"Another suggestion, if I may...Take a break from this subreddit for a few days here and there and focus on something you love/enjoy."
3793,"You won't miss anything earth shattering, I assure you."
3794,Take care of yourself and reach out if you need to.
3795,I doubt these studies are controlling for entire families bringing their full McDonalds dinners on to the flight to eat at leisure
3796,People think that because they were hanging out with their friends and others outside during the summer that somehow if they hang out with them inside they won’t get the disease.
3797,Clearly that’s not true as numbers have spiked since the rain started back.
3798,"I don’t think this has anything to do with age, it has to do with a false sense of security that people got during the summer months"
3799,That also means that the numbers from the East can also be wildly off from their reported death numbers.
3800,Most likely off by more than 30%.
3801,Just go golfing and have a presidential helicopter on standby and you're good!
3802,"So
About the same as a flu shot 💉"
3803,A family member went out of her way to personally attack me yesterday for staying home during Thanksgiving dinner.
3804,I didn't even know they were doing it last night because I wasn't invited by my father.
3805,"I was talking about this with my girlfriend last night, this passive enforcement is how law works in the making, and is effective because their choices become the determining factor of their outcome, removing the unnecessary mental stress from the health workers."
3806,It's free where I am in the US.
3807,And you can get it done repeatedly.
3808,My family (on my dads side) is doing both thanksgiving and Xmas.
3809,"Gramma is terminally ill, and might not be around by June or July when the vaccine is projected to be ready."
3810,She might not even be around next month.
3811,"So, yes, we will do those holidays as they might be her last."
3812,"Sure, we will be quarantining before and after, but there is still a risk."
3813,I don’t say this to upset anyone.
3814,I say it because you (we all are) living in your own tiny world.
3815,"It can be hard to empathize with and understand why someone might make the choice they are making to travel- but at the end of the day, you actually know very little about why someone is making the decision to do so."
3816,I’m not making excuses for anyone.
3817,I’ll likely be downvoted to Timbuktu.
3818,"I just think it’s important to understand first before imparting judgment, and it’s also important to know there are underlying factors you haven’t got a clue about that are probably playing into the decision."
3819,Spreading the “love”
3820,Shutting things down makes sense.
3821,But shutting things down without economic safety nets (which we don't have in the US) does not make sense.
3822,"And to be honest, even when we supposedly had safety nets in place in the spring, people were still falling through the cracks a lot: unemployment not getting approved for months, small business loans snatched up by big business, etc."
3823,Exactly.
3824,We are working from home.
3825,Homeschooling.
3826,All activities canceled.
3827,All vacations postponed.
3828,Haven’t seen my husbands family in a year.
3829,And some “friends” are posting about their vacation to Florida.
3830,":-/

I can relate to this kind of pissed you mention..."
3831,So we're gonna get pumped up with spicy monkey juice?...
3832,I'm in
3833,NZ?
3834,"As an Aussie, this is like slowly driving past a terrible car accident."
3835,"All I can do is watch in horror and hope for the best, while knowing it's pointless."
3836,Jesus would disagree
3837,You're not doing anything wrong.
3838,I bet the people that are saying you are haven't even followed their own advice.
3839,You are being responsible by quarantining and getting tested.
3840,I'm going over my parents.
3841,We live one street over and have been in contact the entire time.
3842,We all work from home and only leave the house to go to the grocery store and we all wear masks.
3843,We've had a rough year outside of just covid and we need to be together.
3844,Mental health is just as important as physical health.
3845,We can't ignore mental health.
3846,"SIL diagnosed with Covid, Flu A and Flu B"
3847,"We were testing about most possible cases in summer, but now you can't get tested easily."
3848,"Thus we were seeing the IFR and that only among young/healthy people who traveled and partied, then we saw the normal IFR and now we're close to the CFR."
3849,We were fucked 4 years ago when trump took office
3850,As the rest of the world open their boarders.
3851,I hope we're not as fucked as i think we are
3852,I just had a free flu shot and free tetanus booster in the US.
3853,And?
3854,This has been my experience also.
3855,I have been harassed and threatened a few times for wearing a mask.
3856,"The management in some of the stores do not do much to help, and really aren't enforcing masks."
3857,I no longer pick up orders in those areas.
3858,The kroger ones are the worst for cat fishing.
3859,Yikes.
3860,That sounds absolutely frustrating.
3861,"Thanks for sharing your story though, and I wish you and your family the best."
3862,Maybe 100m total?
3863,"I think people are referring to the initial supply, or the day-0 supply"
3864,"Population about 800,000."
3865,"We have had it quite good until now, due to border travel restrictions and an early and consistent mask mandate."
3866,Indoor living with the cold weather now is not helping.
3867,"This news, as minor as it seems given the stories posted on here every day, had lineups at stores yesterday, from people stocking up for an expected shut-down."
3868,"Keep in mind, that's Nationwide so local minima and Maxima are obscured."
3869,Some states will hit their testing capacity before the national numbers look bad.
3870,Yes it is possible.
3871,We had an emergency law passed in spring that would allow them to close places like malls and restaurants.
3872,The government just let it expire.
3873,And our compliance with unenforceable recommendations is now so bad that we are getting multiple government press conferences a week talking about how much worse it is.
3874,&gt;So?
3875,As you say they don’t need to.
3876,"Oh, they do."
3877,They're already facing capacity issues in hospitals (not even for the first time) with a fraction of Europe's cases.
3878,"Then again, when you staunchly keep pretending the virus doesn't exist, like Japan's been doing since March, you can sell whatever number you want."
3879,&gt;What’s your point?
3880,"My point is that ""Europe"" and ""Asia"" are stupid generalizations that mean nothing and explain even less."
3881,"Oh, especially bar owners."
3882,Scum.
3883,"Harassing, tax-cheating, customer-cheating, employee-cheating slimy scum."
3884,I've known bar owners that would even water down the liquor bottles with water and add food coloring if they had to so it would look like liquor.
3885,Absolute trashy scum.
3886,Meanwhile I got a honey baked ham company gift card at work for $50.
3887,The cheapest ham on their site is $54... plus $60 shipping and handling
3888,"Wait till mid December, 2 weeks after thanksgiving."
3889,HospitAls will be beyond capacity.
3890,It’s going to be a very rough Christmas because people don’t listen
3891,Nope.
3892,That's not how liability works
3893,Welcome to the USA.
3894,We know who you are now.
3895,Just wear a mask and stop bitching.
3896,It's not that difficult.
3897,Theres gonna be a lot of sad families around Christmas.
3898,[deleted]
3899,"Reset the table to show total, not per 100K."
3900,Different story then.
3901,"

Lockdowns kill people too."
3902,"There are suicides, rising unemployment (which we know takes away life years), cancer treatment that suddenly stop because covid is more important."
3903,You do realise people die ALL THE TIME right??
3904,"How about heart disease, cancer, car crashes."
3905,"The change of dying in a car crash is way higher than being a covid victim, for those in the younger age."
3906,Should we ban cars?
3907,Every life matters right?
3908,How many  40 year old cancer patients would you slowly torture to death for your convenience?
3909,SEE WHAT I DID THERE??
3910,?
3911,Absolutely.
3912,"After I get the vaccine, I’ll go see a movie in a theatre... any movie, I don’t care what."
3913,I’ll go to dinner in a nice sit-down restaurant.
3914,I’ll go on a weekend road trip.
3915,"As a nerd, I’ll go to the first sci-fi con that happens near me."
3916,"I’ll still wear a mask wear possible, if only so that others feel comfortable (at least until large numbers of people get vaccinated)."
3917,Everybody worried about Turkey gatherings.
3918,I’m more concerned about the reunions that always take place on Wednesday.
3919,It’s probably the 4th/5th biggest party day of the year.
3920,"New year’s, Halloween, St. Patty’s, &amp; Wednesday."
3921,My family (on my dads side) is doing both holidays.
3922,"Gramma is terminally ill, and might not be around by June or July."
3923,She might not even be around next month.
3924,"So, yes, we will do those holidays as it might be her last."
3925,"Sure, we will be quarantining before and after, but there is still a risk."
3926,I don’t say this to upset anyone.
3927,I say it because you (we all are) living in your own tiny world.
3928,It can be hard to empathize with and understand why someone might make the choice they are making.
3929,Especially if it’s inherently irresponsible.
3930,"But most of the time you only know 20% of the story, so it’s probably best not to judge."
3931,"There were a couple of things in my favor:  

1."
3932,"Covid - wasn't at work, didnt' have same triggers
2. developed a hacking cough that scared people
3. had access to a therapist and cessation supplies (gum, patches, etc.)"
3933,"4. am getting older past the halfway point
5."
3934,"Had lots of water, gum, hard candies
6."
3935,"Frequented places like this
7."
3936,"I told everyone so then I had no choice
8. unhappy about losing sense of smell
9. unhappy about skin, teeth, etc."
3937,"10. unhappy about ""The Smell""  
11. made two lists ""what i will gain from quitting smoking"" and ""what I will lose""  - it feels dumb but it helps
12. just keep imagining a future where you don't smoke
13. tried to keep myself busy and occupied 
14. am on wellbutrin
15. lastly, i've seen a respirator in action"
3938,I feel [this video](https://twitter.com/ksdknews/status/1131479304687226882?s=21) of a tornado only viewable by lightning is the perfect illustration of what Osterholm described.
3939,The gasp at the end seals it.
3940,"This was of one last year that I believe was about to hit or already went through Jefferson City, MO and was headed in my direction but missed me or got weaker."
3941,They’re doing fine on covid.
3942,And the country with the best fanciest smartest most exceptional brilliant medical system and pluckiest hardest working people is doing much worse on covid.
3943,"Delusion, much?"
3944,It doesn’t really matter if you have a bunch of fancy shit when your nation state is filled with horrible people.
3945,I wish it was just magafucked but at this point on the pandemic with everyone so complacent it's Everyonefucked.
3946,My liberal buddies just had a beerlympics party last weekend with upwards of 40ish people.
3947,I guess to celebrate the rise in cases in our area?
3948,"We banned travel from China to the United States and it was labeled xenophobic, yet we have no problem in calling for bans traveling across states."
3949,We're fucked
3950,My husband had a friend  who was a non-masker.
3951,He died of covid last week.
3952,"His actual funeral  notice said ""no mask required."
3953,WTF.
3954,I told  my hubby  if he goes he will isolate during the holidays.
3955,The car social  club that they all belong to has had about 12 or 13 cases.
3956,(2 deaths.)
3957,They haven't  decided  yet if they are canceling  their Christmas  party.
3958,I am so tired of worrying  about this.
3959,I'm bummed because I believe that you are right.
3960,I can see how Skynet came to the conclusions it did.
3961,"I wonder how they are going to do that, since that needs -70C cooling?"
3962,Where did they commandeer a fleet of deep cooling trucks and containers?
3963,Our hospitals are full.
3964,I just got off and we’re playing move the patients all night just to get icu beds open
3965,Sure.
3966,To be clear Im talking about those in authority.
3967,"I live in France, another country which seems to have put more effort into PR than effective policy."
3968,"You have no idea how many people have parroted the mantra, ""We have to live our lives"", when I tell them that maybe sightseeing / spending the day in a museum / going to Disneyland / making no effort to self isolate are not good ideas in a global pandemic."
3969,Ugh idk if I should go to my parents.
3970,"Our Thanksgiving would just be them and me, but I live alone."
3971,So they're... Out of my bubble.

3974,Our health minister said that we will get 100 million doses but wouldn’t talk about the details of the deal: https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/impfdosen-biontech-101.html
3975,Wikipedia says it likely started from processing bats and their Guano for traditional Chinese Medicine.
3976,"So Chinese people were ingesting bat poop, and that’s how it started."
3977,And then the Chinese government tried to cover it up until it was found to be a pandemic.
3978,"And when all is said and done, it will be probably be American technology that once again puts an end to the worlds problem."
3979,You mad?

3985,7am on a weekend rules where I live.
3986,All the morons are asleep from celebrating their rage.
3987,It is not free.
3988,You pay huge amount of money for that shot.
3989,What kind of a source is unilad lol
3990,That's a cool way to think about it.
3991,Just please stay home if one of you does get sick.
3992,We don't need people taking up hospital beds because of their stupidity.
3993,If we could all agree on that I wouldn't care what people did.
3994,Do you people have some kind of hatred towards medical and health personnel?
3995,Even so that would be strange behaviour given how many of you might meet them soon (or perhaps not if there are too many people before you in the waiting line).
3996,"Ski season is just about to open here, but this is constantly on my mind."
3997,"Of I just myself, do I want to end up in the hospital with a bunch of covid patients."
3998,"Probably naw, so I need to take it easy."
3999,"Masks certainly help, but they have to be worn *consistently and correctly,* which is apparently beyond the ability of most Americans to do."
4000,How?
4001,"71 million Americans lived through the past 4 years are still decided Republican was the way... if there was a time to wake up and smell the lack of healthcare, propaganda, and xenophobia it was this year."
4002,And yet.
4003,So did every government in the EU.
4004,I am Bulgarian and we made a deal with Pfizer for 16 million (Since we have a much smaller population).
4005,That does not mean one country gets theirs in full while the others wait.
4006,"Those orders will get fulfilled in the years to come, the European union has decided to let every country get a proportion of the vaccines until their original order is met."
4007,"Meaning that let's say Germany would probably get 1mil at first, Bulgaria will get something like 100k, etc..."
4008,"This is for the front line workers (Doctors, Nurses, Critical patients, whatever the countries government decides on) If you are actually thinking that some countries will get priority over others is mad."
4009,That is not how you treat a pandemic.
4010,edit: Also don't forget Pfizer has factories all over Europe and Turkey.
4011,They are not stationed in Germany.
4012,Quit letting airlines make the calls.
4013,Shut them down.
4014,"New Yorkers at least, for the most part, have seen firsthand how bad things can get."
4015,"You’ll always have the selfish folks, but no one there is denying the existence or science of it."
4016,The fed unemployment extension runs out right after Christmas 10s of millions of americans will be SOL if they can't find a job before then.
4017,"No, social distancing is hardly guessing."
4018,It’s repeated over and over again throughout this pandemic.
4019,You bet money on it.
4020,"We could have avoided at least half of these deaths, too, and our neighbors could have done similar to us (maybe except Italy)."
4021,Only in comparison we are good.
4022,In any case it will make for an epic case-control study for aspiring epidemiology PhD students in the coming years as they comb through the data to see the after effects of those segments of the population who got the vaccine versus those who refused.
4023,Do you have a source?
4024,It does sound very plausable can I just Google it and find a decent source.
4025,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't the CDC suggest reopening schools during that little period when it was run by certain virus-denying types being packed into the CDC?"
4026,"I remember a little period last summer when the CDC officials were saying some pretty crazy shit, dangerous shit, because people loyal to a certain somebody were packed into it."
4027,Tested positive yesterday.
4028,Hello quarantine.
4029,"In TN, common sense or lack of, is also to blame."
4030,RemindMe!
4031,33 days
4032,I feel like this would put undue stress on an already bad situation: if manufacture doesn't get all 40 million second doses out and distributed on time them couldn't that lead to first doses going to waste if the second one isn't given on time?
4033,"Sweden, Florida, and Texas started out as the sub's guinea pigs."
4034,Each place took different approaches and people are hanging on to see how each of their strategies works.
4035,"For awhile people were surprised by Sweden but, of course, even now, the game isn't over."
4036,"If there was more and better coverage we'd probably be following Africa, India, and Brazil."
4037,Loaded metaphorical bombs 🤣 the rhetoric uses by corona-sketchers is really fun
4038,"Before people chime in with ""hErD iMmUnItY wAs nEvEr ThE sTrAtEgY"", here is a record of us not-strategizing: https://twitter.com/edalmaxwell/status/1293527377566478337?s=19"
4039,Greatest Fucked of all Fucks
4040,"huh the peak is the highes point after which it goes down (in difference to a plateau what we see here in germany) so the title ""may have already reached it's peak"" is fine."
4041,"Depending on the case count after ""lockdown"" is lifted we might know is the second wave is over and it was the peak or it picks back up and we might see a new peak (making the first peak an inflection point)."
4042,What about the liars and morons?
4043,😬🤯
4044,Can some people stop pretending pandemic fatigue isn’t a thing?
4045,I’m sick of seeing people being shamed for doing anything other than staying home and making essential trips...aggressively quarantining for months on end is bad for both your physical and mental health.
4046,I'm in New Zealand and there has tended to be an inverse relationship between education and concern about the virus here.
4047,Is a runny nose something to be concerned about if I don't have a cough or shortness of breath?
4048,I work in homes and businesses in Texas.
4049,We always wear masks.
4050,"YESTERDAY, I was hired to do some work in a church."
4051,No one had masks on in there.
4052,They (preachers family) were walking around talking about tomorrow’s service.
4053,Texas is doomed.
4054,[removed]
4055,In Australia we've been told that if you want to jump the queue you will be able to buy a dose of an available (and approved) vaccine for yourself.
4056,Australia will have at least the Pfizer and (assuming it passes Phase III) the Oxford vaccines initially available and more options later next year.
4057,[removed]
4058,close the damn airports.
4059,wouldn't that be the sensible thing to do to discourage travel?
4060,They had a working SARS vaccine?
4061,I figured these first two vaccines are from reverse engineering the virus and attacking the part that allows the vaccine to enter the cells.
4062,100% agreed.
4063,&gt; All they have to do is vote together to get the candidates and policies they want.

That's not the way democracy works."
4065,"When there's a divide of 60% and 40%, the 60 don't get to permanently control the other 40."

4067,!RemindMe
4068,At least everyone is wearing masks here
4069,"Will take about 6 days to get to 13 mil, probably 5 days to 14 mil."
4070,At these rates the USA will have a billion cases by March!!
4071,!
4072,50 million doses includes other countries.
4073,"I believe the US gets 25, which is enough for 12.5 million people."
4074,"Moderna’s not far behind, but also a 2 dose vaccine."
4075,Last I heard total possible (not guaranteed) was enough vaccine for 20 million people between Moderna and Pfizer in the US by end of December.
4076,Enough to make a difference in hospital overload since they’ll vaccinate the most vulnerable elderly and healthcare workers first.
4077,But it won’t help much if half the country gets infected in the next four weeks from idiotic travel and group gatherings for the holidays.
4078,"But we already knew there was going to be more cases in the winter, just like the seasonal flu."
4079,This isn't really news.
4080,I don't understand this.
4081,Are people driving more in the pandemic?
4082,As I understand it people are dying *with* Covid not *of* Covid and doctors are just making extra money by fraudulently misclassifying deaths as Covid.
4083,Giant /S.
4084,Paywall.
4085,[deleted]
4086,It's a supply chain issue as much as anything.
4087,"Before the pandemic, most toilet paper was manufactured for business."
4088,Because that's where most people poop - at the office.
4089,"Overnight that changed, and the supply chain was configured wrong."
4090,Stock got depleted with no way to replenish the demand.
4091,"The question is, how much do you change the supply chain?"
4092,People went back to the office.
4093,Some stayed home.
4094,What is the ratio now?
4095,"Interestingly, at Sam's Club the other day packs of home toilet paper and paper towels were nearly bare."
4096,Boxes of commercial toilet paper right next to them looked untouched.
4097,Well at least we all have access to affordable mental healthcare amirite?
4098,Why would they.
4099,Covid ain’t their fault.
4100,We will always be here for you.
4101,"My parents generation called us weak, spoke down to us when we were given a series of raw deals that started right around the same time in our lives."
4102,Nevermind they never had to deal with what we faced/continue to face.
4103,"Now they're old and dying, they're terrified - and they still fight us."
4104,They dismiss us like we are children.
4105,The never stopped underestimating us.
4106,Talk to someone about how you feel.
4107,How you feel is the most important thing there is.
4108,Every single one of you will help change the world.
4109,In this case: You can't lose if you don't play!
4110,With a fatality ratio of 0.0002 if your &lt; 49 or 0.005 for if you're &lt; 69's - it's probably harder for them to be pessimistic than optimistic in all honesty.
4111,I don't understand this sentiment at all.
4112,There are plenty of free tools available to meet virtually.
4113,It isn't like you can't contact your family at all.
4114,You have to miss one year of holidays.
4115,It will save lives.
4116,"Maybe not your own, but maybe your neighbor, or your co worker, or their parents, or people you don't even know."
4117,Is it really that hard to have enough empathy to realize that slowing the spread of covid is more important than holidays?
4118,"Its really easy to trigger people when they have no viewpoint except a selfish ""me me me"" attitude."
4119,&gt; I’d personally wear a mask bc it promotes mask wearing generally for the public.
4120,This is where I am.
4121,I probably had it back in March.
4122,My church was an initial outbreak spot a week or so before the initial shutdown started.
4123,They weren't testing anyone back then.
4124,"I still wear a mask, stay home as much as possible, etc.... because it encourages those behaviors in others who may be vulnerable."
4125,My county provides free testing in each city.
4126,just world fallacy!
4127,This is the way.
4128,California has already banned the sale of animal furs.
4129,I make sure that none of the clothing I buy is made from animal parts.

4162,I’ve gotten takeout 3 times since March
4163,One reason small children are less likely to spread it at school is probably because in many countries under 12 are in smaller groups and don't mix with other classes.

4317,I work in a inpatient pharmacy at a local hospital and I can tell you right now we have maybe about 60 people with covid.
4318,Resources are not strained.
4319,People are not dropping like flies.
4320,"The hospital is not being over run by patients....

I’m in Miami."
4321,Also we have normal day to day operations in the hospital.
4322,Full day of surgery’s and plenty of chemotherapy patients.
4323,"No medication shortage...

Now I’m not downplaying what’s happening but just stating what I’m seeing every day."
4324,LOL.
4325,She has a formidable death stare too.
4326,Wish the managers where I work would do this.
4327,"They intimidate workers just fine when they want to, but in the event of a customer conflict, they like to hide."
4328,I admire what you are doing so much.
4329,"look at the top post, they woke up, lol."
4330,Still got enough toilet paper and paper towels to carry me to 2021 (mainly acquired after they started coming back from the first mad rush).
4331,he want fR3edOm !
4332,Username checks out
4333,Individual freedom isn’t the only part of democracy though right?
4334,US will get there all by itself 😣
4335,"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driverless_tractor

&gt;Driverless tractors were initially created to follow a main tractor (with a driver)."
4336,"This would allow one driver to do twice as much work using what is called ""follow-me"" technology."
4337,The driverless tractor would follow a lead tractor between fields just like a hired hand would.
4338,"But now driverless tractor technologies have moved toward autonomy, or independent functioning."
4339,&gt;**The driverless tractor is part of a move to increase automation in farming.
4340,** Other such autonomous technologies currently utilized in farming include automatic milking and automatic strawberry pickers.
4341,"It should be the manager, not the cashier."
4342,And waiting until they checkout just defeats the purpose.
4343,Let them shop the whole time and only when they are ready to leave you ask them to leave?
4344,That's just dumb.
4345,"And again, if a manager let's his employees handle situations like this then they don't deserve to be in any position of power."
4346,I never let my employees handle angry or upset customers.
4347,[deleted]
4348,&gt; Are you all insane?
4349,"No, but our government is full of corrupt assholes, so what you guys are asking for simply will not happen, no matter how many times you downvote me for my factually correct statement."
4350,"I'd support people staying home and bills being paid, but sadly that just isn't reality in America."
4351,Everything is expensive.
4352,You just don't see the bill cause it's paid for by the government.
4353,It still costs them money.
4354,"In this case, it's actually $0 for US people as well because the insurance company figures its cheaper to pay for everyone's flu shots because in the long run they will have to pay less in flu related hospital bills."
4355,Thanksgiving is my favorite time of the year so no thanks!
4356,"(In all seriousness, thanksgiving isn’t the problem, travel is)."
4357,"&gt;The issue is not a east west thing 

No, it absolutely is."
4358,Primarily it's a 'The US is full of ignorant entitled morons' thing.

4360,I have no feeling one way or the other.
4361,"If I understand your comment correctly, you’re lamenting the fact that people don’t get to travel the world and have a house with a heated pool and a tennis court?"
4362,"Those are, and always will be, ultra-luxuries."
4363,"If you think it’s a “shame” the average American doesn’t have a tennis court and home gym, your World View is pretty sick."
4364,"It seems like you’re using this as some sort of excuse for bad behavior... You’re saying: “since average Americans don’t get to live a lavish and luxurious lifestyle, you can’t expect them to stay out of Red Robin for 9 months”."
4365,You’re point is absurd.
4366,Sustaining life at all cost is inhumane.
4367,Fewer people thriving is better than more people existing and suffering.
4368,But 800 million people in abject poverty is not a good thing...but you somehow think it is.

4370,I hope the last party of their lives was a memorable one.
4371,&gt;I hope immunity lasts freaking eons.
4372,On that we agree
4373,The real shame is the number of people who lack empathy to be able to come to these conclusions without having to experience them first-hand first.
4374,Never got a flu shot and I've never gotten the flu.
4375,And I'm not planning to get the covid vaccine either.
4376,"Has nothing to do with Bill Gates, I just don't want it."
4377,"It does work if people actually do it, as in *everyone*."
4378,The virus isn’t magical.
4379,It can’t survive more than a week or two without new human hosts to spread to.
4380,"If a lockdown is universal, and enforced properly, it works (see: Australia, NZ)."
4381,"But if it’s a chaotic piecemeal approach with a whole load of exceptions and exemptions, and isn’t actually enforced properly, yeah it’s useless."
4382,I got some really cool Dita Von Teese masks.
4383,I actually really do like wearing it.
4384,"As it gets colder in MI, a warm mask is sorta nice."
4385,"Oh, and I don’t want to get sick or get anyone else sick."
4386,Also that.
4387,"Don't post plain truth, you'll get downvoted."
4388,At least give it a try and mention the White House.
4389,Convenient.
4390,First one huh ?
4391,What.
4392,A. Coincidence.
4393,Of course
4394,Yes... they’re actually taking this seriously
4395,We need better tests.
4396,"Iran had over 44,000 death from covid, the health minister should've fk'd off months ago."
4397,Rebab facility for my friend.
4398,Rapid tests daily
4399,Doctors and nurses follow all the guidelines and they still get infected.
4400,"The guidelines help but they are not a guarantee, ever."
4401,"If you really want to have as low a possible chance, you would drive."
4402,"Flying, even if done perfectly, is still much higher risk."
4403,"Well, soon only one of you will be living in one world, so there's that."
4404,"if they are on Yelp or similar, I would give them a bad review and call the company to complain."
4405,And we'll comply.
4406,And live.
4407,"Doesn't sound like a wild assumption at all for March 8 -- who could have predicted that the country would go into 9 months of restrictions, quarantines, and widespread mask usage?"
4408,Or that we would have vaccines in record-breaking time?
4409,"If we hadn't gone into varying degrees of lockdown, and if we were looking at another year of this virus, 70-150 million infected sounds about right."
4410,"And will not, because the part of his party that shows up for primaries is *pissed* at him for admitting that Coronavirus is a thing and doing the bare minimum back in March/April."
4411,"He very obviously eyes a future on the national stage, but will not be able to get there if he loses a primary."
4412,And I wish someone would break it to him that no amount of pretending COVID doesn't exist now will make it up to the fucking morons who are mad at him for doing the right thing a long time ago.
4413,Contact tracer from California here.
4414,"I'm not speaking for my county, but offering my insight as someone who has been trained to have these conversations with people."
4415,I regularly help people figure out the safest way to balance their risk with their circumstances because my health dept recognizes that people's lives are not one-size-fits-all.
4416,"#Best Option

Use remote video to stay in touch throughout the day (Zoom, Facetime, Google Hangout, Whereby, etc)."
4417,"I know it's not the same, but many positive cases and exposed contacts I talk to tell me this really helps."
4418,There's something about seeing the person's eyes and their smile (and seeing them react to you in real time) that significantly mitigates the loneliness and depression that come with isolation and lockdowns.
4419,Even some of the contact tracers I know who live alone are starting to have regular video chats *with each other* on days off just to have that connection.
4420,"That being said, it's not my place to say that's enough for your situation."
4421,"So...

#Next-Best Option

Quarantine."
4422,"Remember:

-	A negative test does not mean either of you are coronavirus-free."
4423,You can be infected and a test will miss it if the virus has not reproduced enough to be at a detectable level.
4424,"Even in a person who tests positive, the most reliable tests (PCR) work by replicating the virus material over and over for days just to get to a detectable level."
4425,"-	It can take up to two weeks for an infection to result in symptoms, and you can be infectious even if you never see symptoms."
4426,Sit down with a calendar and figure out when you last interacted with other people.
4427,"Assume you were infected on that date, calculate the same for your dad, and you shouldn't be within six feet of each other until two weeks from whichever date is later."
4428,-	Wear masks any time you are in the same room until you are past that two week period.
4429,Remember that masks do not eliminate the risk.
4430,"They *reduce* the risk significantly, but not to zero."
4431,"Once you have cumulatively spent 15 minutes within 6 feet of each other, even with masks, you are considered exposed."
4432,"The CDC says that 15 minute limit resets every 24 hours, but my health department recently changed our guidance on this because we have reason to believe it does not reset."
4433,"You could get a minor infection today that struggles to take hold, but if you're exposed to an infected person again a day later that could give your minor infection the boost it needs to turn the tide and spread."
4434,I'm providing both guidelines just so you can consider them and make the best decision for your family.
4435,-	Your dad will probably stop for gas somewhere on the way to Baltimore.
4436,He should wear a mask when he does and thoroughly clean his hands with hand sanitizer after operating the pump.
4437,Eating at home or packing a lunch is probably preferable to stopping for food to minimize interactions with the public.
4438,That’s such a dead point.
4439,That rhetoric was purely politically motivated.
4440,No serious scientific expert actually believed that.
4441,"In fact, the first article I ever read in the first week of the “two week” quarantine was a pandemic scenario in which the pandemic trajectory could last years without intervention."
4442,"The science has been clear, cut and dry from the start."
4443,And the people in the field change their opinions and projections when presented with new information.
4444,That’s terrifying.
4445,You can’t properly plan a response without reliable and accurate data.
4446,"
&gt;But you didn't comply with any lockdown."
4447,"In Melbourne Australia, we stayed fully locked down, and obeyed our govt and police, for 112 days, I think it was."
4448,"Don't worry, the moment they get another case they'll lock you down for another 112 days."
4449,"“Permanently cured,” do you mean immune?"
4450,Don’t count on it.
4451,Sweden tried the herd strategy and it failed.
4452,They are now taking proper precautions.
4453,What we need now is the vaccine.
4454,"Nah, my mum killed hers in a previous pandemic 60-odd years ago."
4455,Do not recommend.
4456,"Which is definitely why Western countries are getting more deaths per million, got it"
4457,This was my thought when I was at LAX to fly internationally.
4458,"I was there to fly for work and stay there, but I highly doubt all the people I saw were flying for work, too."
4459,"&gt;states putting restrictions and sane people getting scared

But now people are running out of money, with no stimulus on the horizon."
4460,Some sane people will feel the need to go back to work.
4461,... because she repeatedly chose to work jobs she was expressly forbidden to take.
4462,Locking her in jail might have been the better option.
4463,"Tbf, in her case, what the govt should have done was help pay for her losses with needing to take less lucrative work."
4464,Telling someone to live in abject poverty isn't a really sustainable decision.
4465,That's because restaurants lobby for and receive restrictive health codes that preclude street food from taking off.
4466,Look and see how much money it costs to be a street vendor in NYC: the license is literally 6 figures.
4467,But you didn't comply with any lockdown.
4468,"In Melbourne Australia, we stayed fully locked down, and obeyed our govt and police, for 112 days, I think it was."
4469,It worked.
4470,"We haven't had a single positive test or covid death, for 23 days now."
4471,"Our lockdown has been lifted, and masks are no longer needed outside."
4472,"We complied, and we won."
4473,"Stay out the way of this virus, as an individual."
4474,Don't do Thanksgiving.
4475,Thats what kills me.
4476,"I took Epidemiology in the Spring, and the textbook says over and over, for outbreaks of certain viruses and pathogens, or novel ones- wear a mask, social distance, and close stuff down if necessary."
4477,"Book was written in 2014, but obviously this shit has been the standard for 100 years."
4478,"Yet, entitled people think its completely unheard of and its 1984."
4479,Fucking morons.
4480,As does the ignorance stance.
4481,"dude if you 'cough and snot... ...all day while at work', mask or no, you need to see a doctor."
4482,[https://i.imgur.com/pp6FXq0.png](https://i.imgur.com/pp6FXq0.png)
4483,"I'm Canadian so we have Thanksgiving too, it's just in October."
4484,But it's not nearly as big a deal here as in the US.
4485,"Usually there's a big turkey dinner, but that's about as far as it goes."
4486,"And if someone can't make it, no one makes a big deal out of it."
4487,I'm curious if this talks about what kinds of masks were being worn and how long they were taken off for food and beverage.
4488,I believe that we should be requiring N95 masks for air travel...  Maybe after this next wave hits us all
4489,SNL has an audience?
4490,"I haven't watched in a while because I don't want to hear any jokes related to the pandemic, but wow I didn't expect they'd have an audience."
4491,Good.
4492,"I'm tired of seeing that stupid ""meme"" everywhere."
4493,An unrealistic lockdown makes me a snowflake huh?
4494,Keep hiding under your bed from the scarywery virus.
4495,"Trump followers are definitely the dumbest out of the US population, so if he says the vaccine is ok they will drink the kool aid"
4496,"First off: [the actual paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0300891620974755)

Nothing about this research indicates the spread of SARS-CoV-2 started in italy, or that it started in September 2019."
4497,"September 2019 was simply the earliest samples in the set, and the virus was detected from the outset."
4498,What this likely means was that SARS-CoV-2 has been in circulation potentially across a wide area for significantly longer than Wuhan turned into the initial detected outbreak zone of this virus.
4499,"If you ask me, it seems that the virus has been around well before the Wuhan outbreak, and that testing of stored samples of previously-unknown community acquired pneumonia prior to September 2019 is probably required to be more specific."
4500,"That seems logical, as viruses don't just appear and suddenly cause large scale outbreaks -- especially viruses that are largely asymptomatic or mild in most cases like this one."
4501,It takes the correct conditions and a bit of luck for a large-scale outbreak to foment itself into existence.
4502,I feel this so much.
4503,I’ve been super worried
4504,"We'll need far more than 6 months, since we won't even be able to vaccine everyone in that time period."
4505,But each person vaccinated does help slow it so it would at least slow it.
4506,And also get it as soon as you test negative for it.
4507,"Russia is part of Asia, not Europe"
4508,WELL DONE!
4509,Yeah because 0.1% of the population dying is really gonna be a dramatic demographic shift...
4510,"It's will be called battery, might want to educate yourself"
4511,"Think about this, about 2000 Americans are going to be dying on Christmas."
4512,I fucking hate people that think covid-19 is a joke.
4513,Good luck to the family!
4514,"Yes, but it's not just there."
4515,This idea is reinforced nearly everywhere in American culture.
4516,"We're a society of individuals, islands even, so it's no wonder we're not very good when collective action is necessary."
4517,I like how my common sense answers ways get downvoted into oblivion.
4518,That just shows you how the elite want you to think.
4519,i dont think thats correct.
4520,"&gt;But, the safety of employees is a genuine concern."
4521,sad pickle to be in.
4522,walmart has a pharmacy area too and probably they are putting patients at risk by not enforcing masks.
4523,and the patients already probably have a list of pre existing conditions lol
4524,"If you have been closely following this pandemic, you know that this is no surprise."
4525,These will next few months will be one of the darkest periods in modern human history.
4526,Not everyone has a computer or phone or even internet service.
4527,A better idea is to limit the number of people in stores at any one time.
4528,"In my state, limits are based on the size of the store, and even the width of the aisles."
4529,"Go to Trader Joe’s, and there’s always a line to get in because they are smaller than bigger grocery stores."
4530,Masks are also required and can’t remember the last time I saw someone in a store not wearing a mask.
4531,"Personally, I hate shopping for groceries online."
4532,"And given the regulations here and what we know about Covid, I’m not that concerned about getting sick in a well-ventilated grocery store with a multitude of social distancing that i’m only in for 20 minutes."

4554,A whole lot of people are having large gatherings.
4555,More than forty percent of people said so.

4568,We don’t allow good news on this sub😤😤
4569,"King of Shrimps is right, you have to take into account the age and health of those involved, not just the total amount of covid deaths, also their location, ability to afford healthcare etc."
4570,I am much more likely to die by accident than by covid 19.
4571,"&gt;So long as we stick together, we will be ok.

Well it was nice knowing you."
4572,Here king you dropped your ~tinfoil hat~
4573,I do those things to help protect other people.
4574,Not everyone always thinks about themselves.
4575,That's so wrong.
4576,you misspelled tequila
4577,"Seriously, even the word choice screams “made up by someone or something that doesn’t want to pay for something.”"
4578,I'm just puzzled by what you want to have happen here.
4579,"Shut downs are only designed to kick the can down the road, not end the pandemic."
4580,This can be useful to do in the situation where you are afraid the hospitals can't keep up but counter-productive if they can - they make the pandemic last longer.
4581,The vaccines coming out do change the situation though; maybe it's worth it to kick the can down the road to allow people time to vaccinate.
4582,The loop hole is that it takes 72 hours to get a Negative test result from Walgreens.
4583,"You can take a test now, go out and catch corona for 3 days, collect your Negative test result and board the plan while actually being positive."
4584,Yea a friend was complying for her 2 hour Covid wait.
4585,And someone else chipped in the the line for the SNAP and Medicaid offices are always this long and sometime they make you come back the next day.
4586,The help they receive requires a 2/3 hour wait at any given time
4587,I'm gonna go visit family because I had covid and March and am not a spreader.
4588,The only reason it wasn’t a true mandate was due to our horrible legislature doing the same thing recently done to Ohio’s governor.
4589,It's quite simple to estimate the numbers.
4590,"Yesterday, the US hit 200k+ in a day, and it only took less than three weeks when cases reached 100k+ a day."
4591,Christmas is due in four weeks.
4592,"The virus spread exponentially, doubling the stats in three weeks based on what happened yesterday and from the days past."
4593,"God forbid, but 400k+ new cases and 2.5k daily deaths are quite likely to happen, so stay safe."
4594,"I don’t discount their models, but we are JUST at the beginning of exponential growth."
4595,I’m projecting 550k - 600k :(
4596,Even countries that don't have it under control have that.
4597,I thought pretty much everywhere was implementing this.
4598,"They need another flood to trim the town of idiots

Teton Dam Flood"
4599,like DJ style over-the-ear headphones.
4600,"they dont even have to be playing anything, just having them on is enough."
4601,I felt that way back in March when covid infections in the US shot past Italy and China.
4602,"I told my coworker that there is no possible way that the US can be considered the best country in the world now, that we're supposed to be better than this."
4603,"I knew that the country was lacking in a lot of ways, but I truly believed that our nation would never let this virus get out of control."
4604,Now I know that there's a large enough chunk of this country that made containment impossible.
4605,This is just one result of the decay we've experienced for decades.
4606,From what I read it was a different strain.
4607,Involved how?
4608,The rate of infection was still higher in the masked counties at the end of this timeframe.
4609,Two of these counties went from 0 cases to 1 case in this timeframe.
4610,Is that infinity increase?
4611,"Whenever we've had to go to Lowe's or Home Depot, we get there at opening time, when there are hardly any other customers, get what we need, and get out."
4612,Same with anything else we can't easily get through curbside pickup.
4613,That doesn't even make sense.
4614,You can't look TOFI.
4615,Thats the point.
4616,"Something like, the increasing case numbers make vaccine testing quicker."
4617,"It'll also reduce demand for the vaccine, so we've simplified the distribution process!"
4618,A shit ton of people die.
4619,An insane number of people die.
4620,Hopefully there are enough refrigerated trucks.
4621,This isn't fear mongering.
4622,I've been accused of that.
4623,"It can collapse when there are no nurses left to travel to hospitals in need, when healthcare workers are too burned out to keep going, when they get sick, when the nearest available bed is a few states away and patients are being neglected (not out of heartlessness or malice, but because there aren't enough people to help them)

Yeah."
4624,What do you guys think happens in this worst case scenario?
4625,How fucking rapidly are we approaching that?
4626,"I hear the alarm bells, why doesn't the government?"
4627,It's easy to change your mind about social welfare programs when you realize in an instant: your job/industry is gone.
4628,Maybe you have a child who is going off to college.
4629,Maybe you just bought a house /started a new business and put everything you just had into it.
4630,"Maybe you were doing none of the above, but regardless."

4671,That and the credit system are huge depressing factors in American quality of life.
4672,"That would make sense, but it's a very large group that is going to be very resistant to vaccination, so probably not the best focus of initial vaccination."
4673,I don’t think individualism is to blame though because one can be selfless or selfish.
4674,The government will subsidize it.
4675,Is it Riley or Leonardville?
4676,"When I drove for Hunt Bros, those were the two towns that always were on edge from some conspiracy."
4677,I don't really see how that will be possible since some vaccine schedules don't have large numbers of people even getting them until June.
4678,"I'm not sure, but pretending Australia did something super easy, or required ""just a bit of discipline"" is being outright dishonest."

4683,"I 100% agree with you, but the one thing that I’m afraid about when it comes to them charging for it... is all the idiots and people who are very economically disadvantaged."
4684,"We all know that unless it’s mandated that everyone has to get the shot, certain people aren’t gonna get it because they think that $20 is way too much."
4685,"Also it’s the homeless and very poor people that are also the issue, unless they have some sort of system that will help those people, I don’t know what their gonna do."
4686,I spent way too much time (around 20 minutes total) arguing with people on Reddit that the vaccine will be &lt;$50.
4687,They insisted the vaccine would cost thousands &amp; the government would just sit idly by and not subsidize anything.
4688,The price to consumers will be lower than the range quoted in the article.

4707,definitely boggling and so I shared the article.
4708,I had a flu that depleted me so i got a secondary bacterial pneumonia tha tput me in hospital a few years ago.
4709,people i knew had trouble understanding this.
4710,"The flu didn't give me pneumonia, just made it easier to move in and hit me that much harder."
4711,"ever since i'm the annoying friend or relative asking did you get the flu shot this year, &amp; if older have they had their pneumonia booster."
4712,better to have 'em ticked at me than needlessly suffering or worse + spreading it to someone who migh suffer serious complicaitons.
4713,It has already died down compared to how it was earlier this year.
4714,Most people just don't care about this virus anymore
4715,&gt; There is no third option.
4716,There is.
4717,"Talking about it just gets you banned, and watched by the government."
4718,Right now we have all been reduced to not much more than survival mode.
4719,There's no extras.

4722,In fact I've never had one.
4723,"Even prior to the pandemic, I worked second/third shift so my youngest kiddo didn't have to go into childcare."
4724,Things are different depending on where you live.
4725,That's dumb.
4726,"Moderna started their phase one safety trials in March, Pfizer soon after, so we have almost 8 months of safety data on these vaccines not counting animal trials and other initial testing of mRNA vaccines."
4727,A few months isn't going to magically come up with new horrible problems that we didn't see before.
4728,"Someone is likely to have an adverse reaction and die from the vaccine at some point, likely due to underlying conditions, but like most of the vaccines physicians recommend, the risk of contracting the disease is going to be higher than the risk of vaccine related complications."
4729,trust me i know the feeling.
4730,got a friend that live in oregon  .
4731,think covid is a hoax again..... both me and his son have tried and failed with him.
4732,I don't recall people being so enthused over seeing their family or going to the gym before the pandemic.
4733,If you read the first sentence of the article it says they will charge GOVERNMENTS
4734,Aren’t there other illnesses that cause lack of smell and taste?

4758,"Why is it that SK, Japan, Taiwan, Singapore, Vietnam, etc all have much higher imported cases from Europe and the US than China?"
4759,I don't remember when there was an imported case from China the last time.
4760,Some of those 2020 doses are going to the UK I believe.
4761,And then 2021 doses also mix in to go to the EU and Canada and Japan.
4762,But they are warehoused there right?
4763,Time while you aren't caring for them.
4764,"And I don't know where you live, but 5.5 hours is not how long public school is, at least not where I'm from."
4765,Maybe that would explain some of your confusion at the concept.
4766,That doesn't make any sense when the CCP told the WHO that there was a novel coronavirus in early January.
4767,Projections are as soon as next month hospitals in some parts of the US will start rationing care as the regions run out beds.
4768,There’s no more doctors/nurses.
4769,So a field hospital isn’t an option.
4770,Beds need staffing.
4771,You will see if in your lifetime if you live just a few more weeks.
4772,There is always the Jens Spahn approach to solve staff shortages in the health sector - every worker just has to work a couple of extra hours overtime

4776,"Yeah even with these ""high"" numbers Korea ia doing quite well."

4778,Did you even read the article?
4779,It is an exact repeat of today - except there were a few less openly stupid morons slobbering on everyone trying to shop
4780,Downvoted for positivity.
4781,12 million confirmed cases are the ‘all-time’ numbers...there are ~7.4 million people who have recovered and the number of **active** cases is [~4.7 million.
4782,](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) The difference between those two numbers is the death count.
4783,"Even if the number of active cases was 12 million and was miscalculated by 30%, that means that total cases is ~15.5 million."
4784,Not the 60-80 million that you’re saying.
4785,I think the impact of 40 million doses is going to be quite remarkable.

4791,Of course they are.
4792,"Thus is just one stone that contributes to narrative of oh my god, Covid 19 is so dangerous and we are not doing enough to stop it."
4793,"I'm sorry but I live in a country where lockdown has be enforced once again, I live alone alone and have very limited social contact because of lockdown, I  have not seen my gf in 8 months because if travel by restrictions, I am forced to work from home and I can't stand it anymore."
4794,And yet given that I have not yet lost my job and that my income has been steady I should consider myself one of the lucky ones.
4795,"Small businesses closing, people losing their jobs and going hungry, old people going faster in dementia because of the lack of social contact, economic recession, young children having not developing cognitively as they should because of limited social contacts and masks everywhere."
4796,When is this going to stop.
4797,I don't see it as a positive thing either that our only hope of relief is a vaccine that might or might not be made obligatory and that has been rushed to the market without the usual necessary lengthy testing phases...
4798,I'd like to share this video from someone much better qualified than me on the topic.

4818,&gt;People are getting mixed messages.
4819,"Telling them ""You can go work at Target, but don't go to a bar."
4820,"You can work at a grocery store and come into contact with hundreds of people, but do NOT visit your family."
4821,"Starbucks is super essential but also COVID is going to kill you."""
4822,"If they can read between the lines, the message is clearly don't stop making other people money but also don't do anything in your free time that puts you or others at risk of stopping other people from making money."
4823,Haven't you guys ever late stage capitalismed before?
4824,"Understandable theory, only problem is we’re unsure of how well the vaccines prevent infection (sterilizing immunity)."
4825,"We know they offer immensely high protective immunity though, which makes it an almost guarantee that the vulnerable won’t die once vaccinated."
4826,Most won’t even get close to severe disease either
4827,"Ironically, thanks to the quarantine!"
4828,"Shut the fuck up you moron, also your okBR meme is unfunny since you sound like you browse r/atheism unironically"
4829,I just added a footnote right in the graph.
4830,I did some poking around various state websites and this dataset has big issues for many of those states at the top of the list.
4831,Yeah and that's also assuming lasting immunity.
4832,I think there's little known about the level of immunity six months after infection.
4833,The info wasn't held at all!!
4834,!

4857,Started Feb 25.
4858,We ended up quarantined because of a family member testing positive on March 7th.
4859,So it was a damn good thing I did.
4860,The vaccines have been given to a diverse population of tens of thousands who volunteered to receive the vaccine and then go on about their daily lives - That is the point of a late-phase vaccine trial.
4861,This wasn't carried out in a controlled lab setting.
4862,And there really is no way of revising the mRNA vaccines other than changing the dose since they code for a very specific protein on the virus.
4863,It's not going to have a new version or anything

Yeah, man."

4871,"Now, I'm not saying you have to panic if you're a priviliged enough to live in a good area, but not refusing to see the consequences around the globe would be a good start."

5038,Studies so far are all over the map.
5039,"We traded a crappy Melbourne winter for a gloriously normal Melbourne Spring, Summer, and Autumn."
5040,Seems like a pretty decent tradeoff to stay inside your house when it's cold and rainy if it means we can live our lives relatively normal until vaccination day.
5041,The scare in Adelaide was because authorities thought they had a fifth generation case...
5042,Which would have meant it had already seeded deeply.
5043,Turns out it was only a second generation case so alarms were turned off.
5044,It was the right call... Just because something turned out the be unessasary in hindsight doesn't mean that call was wrong based on the data they had.

## Abstract

The devastating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, due to SARS-CoV-2, has caused more than 47 million confirmed cases and more than 1.2 million human deaths around the globe, and most of the severe cases of COVID-19 in humans are associated with neurological symptoms such as anosmia and ageusia, and uncontrolled inflammatory immune response."
5166,"Among therapeutic options, the use of the anti-parasitic drug ivermectin (IVM), has been proposed, given its possible anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity."
5167,"Ivermectin is a positive allosteric modulator of the alpha-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, which has been suggested to represent a target for the control of Covid-19 infection, with a potential immunomodulatory activity."
5168,We assessed the effects of IVM in SARS-CoV-2-intranasally-inoculated golden Syrian hamsters.
5169,"Even though ivermectin had no effect on viral load, SARS-Cov-2-associated pathology was greatly attenuated."
5170,"IVM had a sex-dependent and compartmentalized immunomodulatory effect, preventing clinical deterioration and reducing olfactory deficit in infected animals."
5171,"Importantly, ivermectin dramatically reduced the Il-6/Il-10 ratio in lung tissue, which likely accounts for the more favorable clinical presentation in treated animals."
5172,Our data support IVM as a promising anti-COVID-19 drug candidate.

5174,In Florida a 7 hour wait in the ER pre pandemic was normal.
5175,That's how messed up it is here.

5177,They are not comparable to any Asian city.
5178,The OP is talking shit.
5179,Cannot work.
5180,Business cannot expand with ever decreasing prices and human psychology will stop spending if they think their money will be worth more money later on just sitting and doing nothing.
5181,Meanwhile people with a huge cash hoard get real value for free and the up and coming with no cash get nothing.
5182,"Meanwhile you can never raise prices to account for quality or expansion because ""money is worth more"" and goods and services enter a neverending death spiral of price wars with the lowest price winning and not quality or service."
5183,Deflation would kill not only your economy but your civilization.
5184,Ben Bernanke protector and defender and hero of civilization as you know it.
5185,Whether you want to admit it or not.
5186,"Within 24 hours after those surcharges were announced, every single electric vehicle, possibly out to 6 months into the future, will be sold."
5187,"It would drastically re-calibrate people's list of what they need to do every week, and how to do it."
5188,Mass transit (with it's COVID exposure issues) might make a comeback.
5189,The freedom to jump into your car/truck and go anywhere/anytime is both what's right and what's wrong about the USA.
5190,Because in America we do it bigger and better!
5191,&gt;Large swathes of them are basically just like big Asian cities.

5195,"&amp;#x200B;

I live in Melbourne."
5196,it is culturally Australian and far closer to America than Asia.
5197,And in a generation or two those Asian areas like Box Hill/Chatswood will be as Ozzie as fuck
5198,mine's the fourth so i completely share the sentiment
5199,Masks are not a cure-all.
5200,"Sweden should not be compared directly to southern European countries because of significant differences in population density and cohabitation patterns, for instance."
5201,"Yeah and most observations, BY FAR, say short term immunity still."
5202,A couple articles don't change that at all.
5203,That's kind of the point of not repeating speculative BS during global health crisis!
5204,You're being overly hopefully and it gets more people killed.
5205,The more you talk about unfounded immunity claims the more people justify skipping mitigation efforts and skipping the vaccine.
5206,How can anyone who can even remotely understand the article not realize that?
5207,There's already comments in here say OH WELL that means we don't all need to get vaccinated.
5208,You're killing people in real time spreading BS wishful thinking.

5223,"I've watched probably 80% of the Swedish press conferences and when foreign reporters try to get the authorities to speak about other countries strategies they almost uniformly say ""every country needs to use the tools they think are applicable to their population, in Sweden we have worked with voluntary measures and will continue to do so."""

5256,Normally vaccines takes years of testing to make sure it's safe and to see how long it protects people.
5257,Covid vaccines are being developed much faster but there's some risk to it
5258,Also China is going to fuck Australia hard
5259,"""Health status"" of 124 patients ""was generally poor, particularly in the domains functional impairment (64%), fatigue (69%) and QoL (72%)."""

5265,Y'all remember the homeless doom sign guys?
5266,You are all him now
5267,Because it causes people to take mitigation less seriously AND will cause people to not take the vaccine cuz the internet said I was immune for years!!!!
5268,It's clickbait bullshit too because the vast majority of data points to only short term immunity.
5269,Some of the articles are also calling resistance that would still spread the disease immunity AND YA'LL KEEP UPVOTING THEM ANYWAY!

5291,"Great, let's lock them in."
5292,They need to shut flights down til February
5293,Don't know why you're downvoted.
5294,We had covid patients on the west coast in February.
5295,But I don't think it was quite in the US collective consciousness yet.
5296,How is it challenging your freedom though to say wear an ounce of paper over your face and stay 6ft apart for a while?
5297,Or perhaps the wealthy and large corporations just pay their fair share.
5298,It's more like it may have an average immunity of 6 months.
5299,It clearly doesn't last at least six months in all people.
5300,"If forced to give an estimate I think most doctors will tell you 6-12 months of average immunity, that doesn't mean they are right, it's just the current educated guess."
5301,Anybody who says AT LEAST X months has no idea what they are talking about or just wants some clickbait fame.
5302,Speculating immunity CAN last year in some people is also pretty much useless and most likely counterproductive to getting people to actually listen.
5303,"Immunity really isn't useful at this point with a vaccine coming out, so the articles on it are only hurting our ability to get people to take things seriously in the next few months."
5304,"Long term immunity, short term immunity, it really doesn't matter much."
5305,"Any attempt to actually get enough people immunity will usually overwhelm the hospitals, cause mass panic, screw up the economy, kill more people and not achieve any significant herd immunity."
5306,**These articles will also cause more people to not take the vaccine.
5307,Just stop up voting this crap.
5308,"It doesn't matter if your scientifically interested, right now is NOT THE TIME."

5310,"They would only have 21 days to manufacture, distribute and administer 40 million doses for the second shot."
5311,Risky.
5312,Electric cars will have a positive impact on the air quality in the cities.
5313,But that's about it.
5314,"And I'm not sure about Mars, it doesn't seem like a nice place to live in."
5315,"Bb, captain is trying to tell you that winter already happened on their side of the globe."
5316,So they defeated Covid-19 DURING WINTER.
5317,How remarkable is that?
5318,"And by the time Jan 20th comes along there is only so much Biden can realistically do to try and change the course with any sort of certainty or speed with millions unwilling to comply with reasonable health directives, some rogue Govs and likely not even the Senate on side for passing any legislation to assist."
5319,I got a $20 duck
5320,Because this sub is not full of Belgian redditors posting stories and daily statistics about Belgium.
5321,Because Belgian authorities are not claiming their strategy is better and everybody else are wrong.
5322,Because Belgian government ministers has not been claiming  the rest of Europe is now following the Belgian strategy.

5332,One has a 57x greater chance getting struck by lightening than that.
5333,Ok
5334,I wish I could like this ten thousands times.
5335,It’s a moral failure to be poor in America.
5336,I lost my “real” job during the spring.
5337,I already had hours cut since January due to the supply chain slowdown overseas.
5338,I started turning to sex work on the side for the year previous because I was barely getting by and made slightly more than poverty wages so I wasn’t qualified for any aid programs.
5339,"And then with the pandemic, I couldn’t sex work anymore."
5340,I tried doing online stuff.
5341,"Okay well I don’t have a huge user base (mind you, most people make under $100 on OnlyFans!"
5342,"And same with camming, it’s oversaturated and hard to make much for the shit you have to deal with) and so I wasn’t making a lot."
5343,I’m also in my mid-30s and to be frank subpar looking at best- I can’t compete against college girls in the online market.
5344,I’m just not hot and it takes a huge toll on your mental health to be told how ugly and unattractive you are.
5345,Then I lost my room in a house due to the landlord declining to renew (he knew I lost my job and then rented it out for more than I was paying.)
5346,and I couldn’t rent anywhere else now due to being on unemployment.
5347,"(Lots of landlords will have restrictions like must have had current employment for a year, well I was unemployed for 2 months at that point.)"
5348,I thought okay well I’ll stay at Airbnb’s until this blows over by summer.
5349,Obviously it didn’t.
5350,Airbnbs doubles in price and I start realizing this isn’t ending so I need to save every dime I can in case this hits in winter.
5351,I ended up with everything I couldn’t sell in my storage unit with my life keepsakes and you know like clothes ha.
5352,"I lived on a campgrounds all summer because it was the cheapest, safest place to live."
5353,Plus had showers.
5354,"I got one job interview, but it was online work and I tried to do it from a motel room but the WiFi connection was so bad, I wasn’t accepted for the job."
5355,"I try to rotate between camps, motels, and my car but it’s obviously getting colder and as a woman it’s obviously not safe."
5356,The homeless population has exploded in my county.
5357,Our shelters are over max capacity.
5358,Our housing vouchers had an over five year waiting list before the pandemic.
5359,The next time the major housing charity org in town even has opening to have an appt to discuss options isn’t until March.
5360,So myself and others are shit out of luck.
5361,The kicker is my former employer got six figures of ppp grant money.
5362,Is still open.
5363,Hasn’t lost a thing.
5364,In fact they are hiring supposedly but magically I don’t fit into any of the roles exactly so they don’t have to bring me or the others laid off back.
5365,I’ve had people tell me well that’s only fair- if you had been a good smart kind person with potential you would’ve started a business and done just fine too.
5366,He had quarter a mil given to him by his parents to start his.
5367,I grew up in foster care.
5368,So it does feel like “if you had parents who loved you maybe you wouldn’t have ended up on the streets and being a sex worker.” I actually have no problems with sex work.
5369,But I know I’m a statistic now of what happens to foster care kids (more than half end up homeless at some point in their lifetimes.)
5370,"Many foster kids end up in sex work too and the kind associates with painful abuse and danger, not the kind associated with e-girls who already had a solid safety net."
5371,I tried most of my life not to be reflective of the statistics but yet here I am.
5372,And to your point: I do hate *myself* as a poor person and don’t think I deserve that compassion.
5373,I do wish I would’ve ended up better.
5374,If I was loved enough by others maybe I wouldn’t be in this place and that’s obviously my fault.
5375,"It’s so deeply entrenched in our country that every societal failure is a personal moral failure that even when I understand that fact, I still can’t apply it to myself and my brain continues to beat myself up about it more than the churches who want me to convert to get aide or the people who took pictures of me and others in the food bank line and pointed and laugh at us standing there waiting for a box full of mostly expired groceries covered in mold and stale."

5434,This can lead to a longer lasting immunity.
5435,I don't know if you were around to remember the chicken pox parties.
5436,Chicken pox was thought to be harmless so parents would have little parties so they can infect their kids with chickenpox so that they could hurry up and get it and get the infection out of the way so they don't have to be an adult with chickenpox because apparently it was more severe.
5437,We now know that chicken pox causes shingles.
5438,"!00% effective would be nice, everyone wears a mask for 2-weeks and covid19 would become extinct /s We wouldn't need a vaccine."

5513,People are dumb.
5514,There is a list of criteria in the package insert and that is what our hospital is following for now.
5515,Basically it is geared towards high risk patients only in the hopes of keeping them out of the hospital (we are usually operating around capacity now as it is).
5516,"The vials we got from the federal government were free so they will be given to the patients for free (there could still be charges for the room, nursing time, etc idk)."
5517,"Once it becomes a regularly approved medication that we can purchase, than yes, patients will be charged."
5518,That is correct.

5522,Won't happen though.
5523,The US is also too far gone to the point where the rest of the world are just shaking their collective heads.
5524,Which bloody paper said that?

5538,"The someone who said that was Lenin, right before the Bolshevik revolution."
5539,Actually the thought is to implement and deploy it in a preemptive attack once an at risk infection is detected.
5540,You can’t wait until you know who is a serious case.
5541,So for instance if you got a positive test and you are a 70yo obese diabetic they would show up to your house or call you in and give you an IV.
5542,Then you will most likely have 40% less of a chance or something like that of being hospitalized.
5543,The primary proposed deployment is preventative triggered by factors.

5558,We get weekly testing but it takes anywhere between 3 and 10 days to get results back.
5559,"(Some places offer rapid tests to employees, but not all.)"
5560,That is a lot of people you can infect as an asymptomatic carrier waiting for the test results from a week and a half ago.

5688,Read the book “the easy way to stop smoking” by Allen Carr.
5689,It’s a miracle book for most smokers looking to quit.
5690,I read half the book and quit with ease.
5691,I remember seeing the line trying to get into Cherry Creek State Park during the shutdown.

5702,The problem in America was the messaging.
5703,"Instead of being a public health issue, it became a political issue with President Trump trying to benefit politically for the upcoming election."
5704,"He believed wearing a mask was unproven science and maybe worse, showed weakness in those that wore them."
5705,"So instead of setting an example, he undermined the severity of the disease and attacked the science to justify his position."
5706,"Millions of Americans followed and it quickly became an all or nothing proposition, but it didn’t have to be that way."
5707,"Rather than take the logical approach, he attacked it fully."
5708,"Yeah, masks aren’t 100% effective."
5709,Social distancing isn’t 100% effective.
5710,"Neither is soap, but we use it."

5767,In the US the cheaper housing is way far out from the cities so it’s actually much less money to buy a car and drive in to work and shop
5768,While it is not perfect the US did pay out an extra $600 a week for unemployed through July and $300 I think through December on top of that 1200 and unemployment.
5769,It is not like it is nothing and does come close to $2000/mo
5770,Link is dead :(
5771,"Well, that's positive at least."
5772,I'll keep my fingers crossed for you.
5773,"Also, I'm pretty sure in your line of work (healthcare related) it's probably not likely to find jobs working from home?"
5774,"Maybe I'm completely wrong there, but since you previously worked with sick people and now applying for lab assistant I assume most of the jobs which profile you fit are positions that need a certain environment."
5775,You'd probably have to change your entire field?
5776,Charity is drop in a bucket compared to the resources provided by the state.
5777,"Or the nanny state as Americans call it, even though ours is the least generous of any developed country."
5778,Americans have no idea how much the state does much less the vastly smaller amount done by faith organizations.

5811,And the governor still won't implement a mask mandate.
5812,::facepalm::
5813,"What were the numbers like this time last year, before covid?"
5814,That’s a prime example of cognitive dissonance.
5815,"You have a ton of evidence that smoking is bad and evidence that it kills thousands or millions of people a year, but also a few examples of people who smoked their whole life with no ill effects."
5816,So you focus on the few examples that do not paint smoking in a bad light and ignore all the bad.

5834,"Every time I go to the ER here in the US with chest pain, which is supposed to get you seen instantly, I have to wait about 8 to 12 hours to be seen."

5847,My test came back negative and I saw the doctor the next day.
5848,He straight up told me I was the safest person he has seen and didn't know if he needed a mask.
5849,I asked him to wear one anyways.
5850,WTF
5851,You can simultaneously think it's an honor while questioning the timing and circumstances.
5852,That is what that mayor was doing.
5853,"Honestly, at this point, what stops nurses and doctors from striking?"
5854,"These poor fed up souls are watching people going out, not wearing masks and they end up in the hospital gasping for air with a surprised pickachu face."

5858,"If you won’t try to care we won’t attempt to treat.”

Having a vaccine is awesome but there are still some people who don’t believe so what does it matter?"
5859,The virus can live among the idiots long enough to become something new.
5860,This is the first time in human history where we have a mass exodus from science by a collective group.
5861,Our health care system doesn’t stand a chance in the US.
5862,"Used tol work in a convenience store, and people would spend $700 sometimes $1,000 and then when they finally hit $500 on a $2 jumbo or something, they would post it on Facebook and text and call their friends and family bragging about how much money they had just won."

5890,I had been self isolating for a month with my PTO hoping I was riding out the big wave (egg on my face) before I went back to work.
5891,They demanded I break isolation to go into the nearby student hospital for a covid test to wait in line with thousands of people.
5892,It didn't make sense from any angle.

5936,You're fucking delusional if you think that just because Haiti is doing better at controlling Covid that it  magically means that it's the better country to live in.
5937,Get the fuck over yourself
5938,"And we require competent government getting the shots out, hard to believe after the last 4 years"
5939,Well you know it’s actually the exact opposite if you want to go with the Darwin theory.
5940,"99.5% or more of the people pictured in that bar will survive, which means they are the fittest and have natural advantages to surviving a pandemic."
5941,The people they go on to kill are the ones who won’t survive and thus aren’t the “fittest”.
5942,"So really, by your estimation, the vast majority of people in that bar are “evolutionary superior” since the vast majority of them will survive."
5943,Obviously you don't care.
5944,You want them to quietly die alone.
5945,WHOEVER CONTROLS THE TP CONTROLS THE UNIVERSE!
5946,"Thanks for the info, I was not aware of those limitations."
5947,"With most of the leading vaccines looking incredibly promising, I'm pretty optimistic that by summer of next year life will be much more normal."
5948,We should have vaccinated enough people that outbreaks will be smaller and manageable.
5949,"What is happening in regards to the bathroom, weather conditions and food preparation?"
5950,Obviously staying home is the safest option but if you are truly considering going please take into consideration what will happen if the weather is cold and/or wet-will people throw caution to the wind and gather inside?
5951,"Also, when using the bathroom-will people gather coming and going to the restroom, start chatting and end up in doors?"
5952,"In theory, I believe that some of these types gathering can be safe, but the reality of how people behave and cut corners and start to normalize breaking the rules will mean that most end up not actually being safe."
5953,Excellent.
5954,Just gets better and better.

5956,LOL.
5957,I give up.
5958,That makes even less sense than what you and I have been going back and forth on.
5959,They've always shut the schools down because of the security issues associated with having the general public on school campus.
5960,The idea that they'd allow the public in with it being both a security concern and also a public health concern shows just how little planning or forethought there is.
5961,Here in Florida it was mandated that they couldn't stop people from entering a polling location if they aren't wearing a face covering.
5962,"When I went to the polling location, they had a sign to ""please wear one"" but there were a couple of people in line that didn't have one on..."

5964,"Even if 100% of those party goers got covid there might be one or two, but probably 0, that died"
5965,Scam?
5966,No one is gaining anything from shutting down bars.
5967,It's literally meant to save people's lives.

5971,"For me, that day was March 13."
5972,"First, the goal isn’t to have all workers at their best."
5973,The goal is for the upper middle class to feel safe to leave their homes and spend money again.
5974,"Second, there’s a pretty huge difference between a one-time cost of a few billion dollars for a vaccine, which is pocket change to the kinds of organizations that own significant stock in pharmaceutical companies, and funding public healthcare for everyone, which is an ongoing trillions-of-dollars cost."
5975,edit: an adjective
5976,"But still demands tuition, right?"
5977,"Listen, I’m not saying these precautions are bad but universities should be first in line to be scolded for contributing to the spread."
5978,All of them could have gone remote with no students on campus.
5979,But we all know they didn’t in the name of money.

5995,My patience with people in general is so busted after this year that I don’t really want anything to do with them now even when Covid is not an issue anymore.
5996,Do you eat clean or do you eat processed crap like everyone else .
5997,If you want to get fat eat more shit food .
5998,Or maybe you care about other people.

6019,"If we don't suck it up and deal with some social isolation, many more will die then necessary."
6020,Virtual contact is better than nothing and is a valid option for those that do not want to put others in danger by recklessly traveling during the pandemic.
6021,They deserve consequences.
6022,Then those people complain that they got covid despite wearing a mask smh
6023,"While you idiots were saying masks don’t work in January, I walked into Lowe’s and easily bought 5 N-95 masks."

6035,Random Ball Lotteries are a while different beast.
6036,This is sad.
6037,It’s common sense man.
6038,You don’t see people dropping dead on the streets.

6053,I have no trust in some and I want to see the price that consumers will have to pay in the end.
6054,"Don't give treatment to people who caught it doing something unnecessary and without a mask, and the hospitals wont be overflowing."
6055,"Not only did you sidestep my obvious assertion that money is literally traded as a commodity on the FOREX, you also seem to be dug in on the concept that only fiat currencies can be currency, when the fact is that any medium of exchange between two parties is literally currency."
6056,Your assertion of a requirement of wide acceptance is ridiculous.
6057,"As an American businessman, I'm not going to accept Chinese Yuan, Russian Rubles, or Vietnamese Dong because they have no value to me."
6058,So are they currency or not?
6059,They're not to me.

6071,It’s funny how people can’t accept that for certain age groups that the death rate is indeed quite low.
6072,"I’m not saying this is not a terrible out of control tragedy, but acting like it’s a death sentence for all the people in that bar is ridiculous."
6073,Will they leave and spread the virus far and wide and be responsible for many people dying?
6074,Yes.
6075,Are they all going to be in their death beds in a few weeks?

6085,"On a surprising amount of cases, it's actually cheaper!"
6086,I can almost guarantee that there are more uncounted deaths due to Covid than there are deaths misattributed to Covid
6087,"“Based on all findings, the death was ruled as natural, caused by COVID-19,” the medical report stated."
6088,Doctors determined the death was caused by a lack of airflow through the lungs as a result of the virus.
6089,Okay so we just need to survive for 6 more months on that 1200 bucks we got 6 months ago.

6220,"There is going to be variation, but in general we are looking at about 10%-15% of the us population per month getting both pricks based on current production and contractual obligations."
6221,So back of the napkin - 12% over four months (48% by End of April) plus some immunity from infections and any vaccination done in December probably ~55% and that’s enough to significantly slow the spread at the effectiveness of the current vaccines.

6250,"People can protect themselves well enough just getting the vaccine and those that don't will take the risk in the other direction, neither will likely result in any significant amount of people dying because the virus isn't that lethal and the main goal of the vaccine is to lower the infection rate low enough that this becomes more of a background noise pandemic than one that can shut nations down."
6251,"I mean, it's not like heart disease is not leading killer, yet America is the land of meat and grease too."
6252,People take on a lot of risk just because it tastes good and once vaccines are out people who deny or delay are mostly bringing it on themselves as long as the vaccines are really somewhere around 90% effective the amount of people who can spread it will drop dramatically as we get enough people vaccinated.
6253,"**Beyond that we are really just talking about 20 million of the highest risk exposure people getting it for now, so there will be a delay and people will be guinea pigs for other to watch anyway."
6254,That was always going to be what happened.
6255,**
6256,US?
6257,Ya u guys are beyond fked I am so sorry u guys had to go thru this.
6258,I think ultimately places there will be open as much as possible and it will be upto u to try and avoid anyone high risk in ur life.
6259,/r/titlegore
6260,None of what you've said helps poor Americans any.
6261,Nothing I've said is inaccurate.
6262,"When you make statements like ""Stimulus."
6263,"It has not lead to any wealth transfer"", which it clearly did due to the billions that were pumped into the stock market while ordinary Americans got a $1200 check hmm ok ""Mr Facts""."
6264,I'm shocked at how partisan you are.
6265,"You actually believe your party are the ""good guys"" lol You're literally unable to see how much USG has failed!"
6266,"You won't even discuss the substance of the so called stimulus bill, you only care that it was passed by your team and blocked by the other as if America is the only nation with an opposition party."
6267,Why were other nations able to overcome partisanship and yours wasn't?
6268,Refusing to blame the entire system doesn't protect vulnerable Americans from the results the system produces even if there is a faction within the system that has a heart of gold.
6269,I'm sure you wouldn't insist on blaming belligerent factions within the Chinese government if they had failed to protect Chinese people during this crisis.
6270,You'd be shouting at the top of your lungs how the Chinese dictatorship failed!
6271,Why are you insisting on nuance for your government if it isn't designed to assert that USG is good hearted despite its failure to protect its citizens.
6272,"Anyway, take you your bare minimum and go."
6273,Australia has mandatory vaccine.
6274,It's fine.
6275,With the shit that's coming you better be prepared.
6276,"So if China and Singapore had the same level of human rights as Germany, they would have still performed the same?"
6277,Germany's death toll is down to the German government's failure is containing the spread as effectively as China?
6278,Agreed.
6279,Your complete lack of self-awareness is scary.
6280,Your post is a perfect description of yourself.
6281,"It's not a surrender, it's a tactical retreat!"
6282,Reported for breaking r/Coronavirus rules.
6283,"""Keep information high quality"""
6284,"The article is idiotic, this is a seasonal respiratory virus and the Northern hemisphere, US, Europe, Russia always gets hammered every year by a virus like this."
6285,"There's a bunch of westerners that live in China and from their reports it has been business as usual since earlier this year, with exception to some places where they needed to quash some outbreaks."
6286,"Getting cases down and surviving the pandemic there is a source of national pride, so the vast majority of people obey lockdown rules without the local government needing to weld them in."
6287,"Critics will say it's because the CCP is a heavy handed dictatorship, but personally I think it's because most people there aren't fucking retarded and understand that a little pain now is better than the potential shit storm they'd face later."
6288,Here in Luxembourg we already hit the equivalent of 400k cases in the US.
6289,We also had a equivalent of 4000deaths a day.
6290,Currently nearly 10% of our population is actively infected but we still dont have a lockdown because the icu is still under 35% eventough we had the highest numbers per capita in europe since weeks.
6291,(1500/100k)
6292,UV kills covid19 so expose your chicken to a minimum of 8h of sunlight before consuming it.
6293,&gt; Remember when the idea was to go into the fall with 10k cases a day?
6294,"Long time ago, in a galaxy, far, far away..."
6295,"For what it’s worth, I’m not sure pessimism is the right term for what you’re describing."
6296,I’ve been doing a lot of reading on uncertainty and nihilism lately.
6297,I really do think that optimism/pessimism should include the third option of nihilism (which is not inherently negative although that tends to be the perception).
6298,"To put it into context I’ll use the test example:

You didn’t study for a test."
6299,Do you feel optimistic about the results?
6300,Pessimistic?
6301,"If you’re feeling nihilistic, perhaps your outlook might be that no matter what, you will sit through the test, receive results, and life will continue onwards no matter what the result is."
6302,So you're saying that the East's success is NOTHING to do with human rights?
6303,You're hand on heart going to tell me that?
6304,"So far I've heard there countries with this claim: NZ, China and now S'pore."
6305,Pretty solid evidence I reckon.
6306,So you lot are getting a 911 every day and a bit and you haven't even invaded Chad in revenge yet?
6307,Must be true...I'm from Canary Island and I've never seen any german partyin here in the name of whatever.
6308,"They always say, ""If you're worried about catching COVID, then you wear a mask."
6309,"We're all free to make our own choice."""
6310,"Sure, that sounds great, but I don't want to walk through your potentially infections exhalations when I go to the store."""
6311,To be fair I read an article recently talking about how airplanes are an environment with an extremely low transmission chance.
6312,I read the study that the article pointed to (done by department of defense) and it seems legit.
6313,Also known as halfwits or shit for brains.
6314,My new fave is calling them a fucking walnut.
6315,Idk why but calling them a walnut just feels right.
6316,There were tighter restrictions and recommendations in the Spring.
6317,"In Finland, bars, cafes, schools, gyms etc."
6318,were closed and Norway even had slightly tighter restrictions.
6319,Gatherings for over 10 people were banned while in Sweden the limit was 50.
6320,In the summer we relaxed our restrictions and for a long time Sweden had tighter restrictions because the goal of their restrictions was that they could be in place for a long time without having to constantly adjust them.
6321,None of the Nordic countries recommended masks in the Spring because they were in short supply.
6322,Now Sweden is the only one without a recommendation.
6323,In Finland these are just recommendations but i think that in Denmark and Norway the masks are mandatory in some circumstances.
6324,"As of late, our cases are bit on the rise too and i hope that it doesn't get as bad as in Sweden."
6325,"We have recorded over 400 cases (we have about half of Sweden's population) now in two days this week, which have been the highest numbers since the start of the pandemic."
6326,"Smaller provinces have been able to curb some bad local outbreaks with tight restrictions, but now that the spread is happening in the capital area, the officials seem to be sluggish to act."
6327,"Now they have banned some team and contact sports, but gyms and swimming pools stay open."
6328,"Bars and restaurants are open, although the sale of alcohol must be stopped early and i think that the capacity has been limited."
6329,"There is though a loophole which lets night clubs operate as night cafes, so people can party normally but they have to either drink at home beforehand or smuggle the booze in."
6330,But  how much do Americans pay for their health insurance each month?
6331,I pay $0.
6332,Global pandemic is just a fancy way of saying that it has spread across the globe.
6333,"It says nothing about its real danger, because its IFR is really low."
6334,Australia is about 12% Asian compared with the US at about 6%.
6335,I don't think going from 6 to 12% is some sort of magical tipping point that changes your response to a pandemic from among the worst in the world to among the best.
6336,Australia and NZ have a VERY clear reason for COVID success.
6337,They are extremely sparsely populated Islands in the middle of nowhere.
6338,You're delusional if you think you could plop Australia in the middle of Central Europe and have the same level of success
6339,"You should cook ice cream, just to make sure..."
6340,"A friend (a scientist of course)started working on a vaccine in February, with other companies ranging between January and March."
6341,So it's been approximately a year.
6342,A little less in some cases and almost dead on in others.
6343,Yes they reported it as is protocol.
6344,"Understand that as in all governments there are multiple centers of power, often with conflicting short-term interests."
6345,"The CCP is an example of a system where to get ahead loyalty, faithfully following party doctrine, and not rocking the boat are crucial to millions of careers."
6346,"Emperor Xi clearly did not want early prudent closing of air routes, otherwise China would have done it itself."
6347,"And yes, the virus was circulating in at least Wuhan by mid November."
6348,"Despite this, restricting movement asap would have helped a great deal in easing the early rapid growth."
6349,Sweden has a really healthy population.
6350,They should be knocking this out of the park.
6351,"Also, Belgium loosened its mask mandate mid-September, and Czechia reopened schools September 1st."
6352,"Masks definitely work, and Sweden's failure to acknowledge this with a mandate is borderline criminal."
6353,Thank you friendo!
6354,C: I'm definitely going to do it.
6355,The one good thing about this pandemic is that I'm able to save a lot more through not eating out and having to pay for public transit haha
6356,What a stupid question
6357,"Just a fake breeze from China, and now people in masks are turning their backs on God's Wonderful Breathing System™."
6358,I still can't believe someone said that second part for real.
6359,I wonder if she's still alive now.
6360,"You realize we are talking in part about the same company, German company, founded by an immigrant couple which was later bought by Pfizer?"
6361,Constructing differences based on the US being more private are tenuous especially as the second vaccine got funded by a massive US government cash injection.
6362,Understandable.
6363,Have a good day.
6364,"It’s spread out over 3 months, but number of deaths on one day has been 12 recently, so yes it’s double digits."
6365,[deleted]
6366,[deleted]
6367,It's still the worst first mRNA vaccine so we still have to be cautious.
6368,We know the viral risks better than the vaccine risks at this point.
6369,"Small scale testing isn't the same as rolling it out to tens of millions of people and some of those people who will take the vaccine are very very low risk for the virus to ever hurt them, they will only ever get mild cases."
6370,"Since most people only get mild cases, by far, and it's still a very experimental vaccine framework, the risks are still significant."
6371,"These short term studies cannot possible find all the long term risks and it's not like everyone getting this experiment treatment are old people, some have many many decades of life left for a genetic vaccine to screw something up."
6372,And that is equally as frightening and strange.
6373,Good day.
6374,"Sure, but there are a lot of days between 1 and 28."
6375,This is where people will start the media hype over WHO gets the vaccines internationally.
6376,So how is it preventable?
6377,People on r/COVIDpositive always post how they did everything by the book and despite that still got sick.
6378,Tell me how is the spread preventable?
6379,Or both
6380,"Not seeing unity between the states, tbh."
6381,"Also, good on you for disagreeing with me in a civil manner, unlike some other posters here."
6382,"i always go for pessimistic + prepper so that way if im right im ready, and if im wrong im happy."
6383,"Death is part of life, yes."
6384,What's your point?
6385,&gt;And odds are the covid is not the one to cut our life short.
6386,It's not a fucking airborne Ebola.
6387,Umm...
6388,It is though?
6389,You missed the part where covid19 is a global pandemic?
6390,Common sense
6391,The military has a massive contracting function for wartime.
6392,Part of what they do with is set up contracts to use trucks and stuff so when a contingency begins they have the contracts ready.
6393,This is probably the same
6394,[removed]
6395,"Cases are not decreasing in the US, what are you talking about?"
6396,I literally just said that nobody cares you weirdo
6397,We are doing something similar for Thanksgiving.
6398,We have been in strict quarantine for well over 2 weeks and just got tested (spit) with negative results.
6399,We pulled my son from daycare for 3 weeks.
6400,My parents have also quarantined for several weeks to prepare for our gathering.
6401,And I mean we literally have not gone anywhere.
6402,No grocery stores.
6403,Nothing.
6404,"Only walks around the block with the dog and kid, who we pulled from daycare."
6405,No people within 50 ft of us during the walks.
6406,I feel 100% confident that we can gather safely.
6407,"Like you, we will be quarantining after as well."
6408,Have you been taking vitamin D and keeping your immune system strong?
6409,Odds are slim that this would kill you... most cases in young folk are mild.
6410,But you must acknowledge the risk.
6411,The fact that you’re quarantining after the visit makes it ok in my book.
6412,You’re only putting yourself at risk and no one else.
6413,Why do you feel the need to post this to 500 different subreddits where it doesn't even belong?
6414,"Dude it was in Europe in September 

Wat was anyone gonna do to contain it"

6424,They just started phase 3 trials in India with 26000 participants this month.
6425,"I don't think they already know anything about efficacy yet, they just said they aim for more than 60%:

&gt; ""We aim to achieve at least 60 percent, but it could also be more."
6426,"Chances of the vaccine being less than 50 percent effective are remote, as suggested by our trial results so far"""
6427,Thank you!
6428,The topic is fascinating.
6429,"""Although the first 300,000 doses will be provided for free, patients may be charged for having the treatment administered; it must be infused in a clinic or a hospital."

6431,https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/11/21/world/covid-19-coronavirus
6432,It's impossible to say.
6433,"We don't know how many people were actually infected in India, nor do we know exactly why cases are remaining steady."
6434,Looking at other countries I'd be much happier like that.
6435,"So, the same as every other day?"
6436,"All I know is my gut says, ""Maybe."""
6437,Message me in a few weeks and let me know who/how anyone tests positive.
6438,I'm hoping for the best for you guys.
6439,Honestly if I were a health care worker in a covid unit with some savings I would quit right now.

6445,"So about 4,500 deaths per day soon?"
6446,"A.K.A: 31,500 deaths per week?"
6447,"I'll bet we're going to (unfortunately) be at over 350,000 deaths by the end of the year."
6448,"I work in vacation rental software, and can tell you bookings have been off the charts for our clients lately, particularly Florida."

Everything else is closed, so folks get an Airbnb - some markets are far exceeding historical occupancy levels."
6450,I would do it if the others and yourself know the risks and are being safe we’ll beforehand.
6451,"Masking up, distancing, staying home when possible."
6452,We all choose our acceptable threshold of risk.
6453,Use good judgment and enjoy your family.
6454,"The USA has two borders, both of which have had restrictions in place since March, which leaves air and sea travel, the same as Australia and NZ."
6455,How many covid cases do you think USA have received via their two land borders?

6465,Doesn't take much to figure out that this new surge came from Halloween.
6466,And apparently it's worst than the summer surge.
6467,"With the added quarantine fatigue, a  somewhat superficial hope in this vaccine, and the super holidays coming up, I can only imagine it getting worst."
6468,"Unfortunately, it looks like it'll get so severe before the vaccine can even be distributed"

6470,the gay sons and daughters that were thrown out when they came out suddenly appear for thanksgiving.
6471,"Sheldon Solomon, one of the developers of the TMT, has some pretty good lectures available on youtube if you want to explore further."
6472,Ernest Becker is also worth a read.
6473,I think collectively Australia and Australians take COVID seriously except for a very small but vocal minority.
6474,Covid can.
6475,Give it a few more months.
6476,"I essentially self isolated from March until October, save a distanced and masked meeting with a friend at a local park mid-summer."

6479,"I've also done two in-person job interviews and a dentist visit, maintaining distance and remaining masked the whole time."
6480,Guess what?
6481,I hate the lockdowns.
6482,This sucks and stop pretending it doesn't.
6483,Yep.
6484,Empty shelves at the stores here...it's about the only sign of any restrictions here
6485,That’s really sad.
6486,I feel your pain due to BS relating to work I will not be able to visit my family before the holidays but my mom and dad are gathering with people who don’t wear masks and live well over 50 miles away.
6487,Both are high risk.
6488,Why is your first thought that they are in America?
6489,It's 11 am here in Europe and early evening in Asia.
6490,In Australia it's late evening.
6491,"Whilst majority of the posters in this subreddits are probably American, a big minority are from elsewhere."

6495,Hey don't you give me any Reddit awards!
6496,Canadian thanksgiving also is not nearly as big of a deal as it is in the states
6497,If children are vaccinated it will be after everyone else.
6498,So there is time both for trials and observation of effects in others.
6499,Can’t see what the reason would be to vaccinate children in 2021.

6509,And I mean that because I back it up by wearing a mask and doing everything I humanly can to slow the spread.
6510,Please take care of yourself as best you can and satay safe.
6511,Conversely: he’s also been saying it’s a hoax and barely affects anyone so they might be sceptical of it.
6512,Anyone capable of believing that it’s both a hoax and that they should get the vaccine is quite the nutter.
6513,Thy Will Be Done 👊🏻
6514,I agree with this.
6515,"Also, my wife and I both have health issues that make us vulnerable, but... we also have plenty of cash."
6516,"Cash allows us to stay at home, have everything delivered, and make sure everything coming into the house is disinfected."
6517,"I know there are tons of (health) vulnerable people not in our situation, but categorizing them all as one priority group doesn't make sense."
6518,"So in addition to having enforceable rules on prioritization (healthcare workers first), there should also be some guidelines for people to follow such that old people aren't getting vaccinated so they can go on cruise ships over people who want to get vaccinated so they can be safe with essential jobs."
6519,May be best to go on side of caution and get a bigger one?

6524,Overly dramatic headline.
6525,Just because someone buys toilet paper doesn't mean they are panicked about it.
6526,"If you aren't planning to go to the store again for a few weeks, it makes sense to buy a pack of toilet paper."
6527,It would be dumb to break an effective lockdown *just* to buy tp.
6528,"So, if you go to the store, many people will get a pack since they don't want to come back."
6529,"Multiply that thought process by everyone, and suddenly shelves are empty again."
6530,"But not because people are freaking out, but because they don't want to come back to the store just to get toilet paper."
6531,"My family has milk and eggs delivered to the house weekly, as well as a bi-weekly delivery of veggies from a community farm."
6532,"Once we stock up on canned goods, etc, we only need a grocery trip every 2-3 weeks."
6533,Are you ready for Destroy Democracy December?
6534,That’s so interesting
6535,That's not good is it
6536,And I understand that.

6559,Thanks Thanks Giving
6560,I can’t wait for all the stories about how people killed their grandparents for thanksgiving.
6561,Liquid is probably easiest to make mistakes with.
6562,Just remembering that you _can_ overdose on fat soluble vitamins is almost always sufficient to protect yourself.
6563,"It keeps you from choosing unneccessarily overpowered suplaments, doubling up with multiple suplaments or taking extra pills because you don't remember if you already took one."
6564,The one telling you how it is.
6565,Has anyone said that banning inter state travel is needed?
6566,Part of the reason Australia has done well is that we don't let people travel overseas or between states willy nilly.
6567,If populations can't mix the virus can't spread... but I might be overestimating what Americans are willing to do to not die/ kill others.
6568,"I'm in Europe, I'm working from home full-time since march, I've not been to sports, I've not been out, I'm wearing a mask, I'm distancing, as are a lot of people."
6569,It's not really politicised.
6570,"And still, infection numbers are high."
6571,I think you're oversimplifying.
6572,"According to this link, it seems more like 1,500 to 6500 USD per treatment, depending on the final dose."
6573,"This would not be out of line for the cost of a monoclonal drug currently used to prevent RSV infection in high risk infants, which is the closest MOA/disease area comparison out there right now."

6576,An interesting way to approach the oath.
6577,We should teach it more often in school.
6578,"call it ""the modi"""
6579,Houston....we have a problem!

6581,Dont forget my 2 kids in schools that dont offer hybrid/remote learning
6582,Underestimate*
6583,Thanksgiving is the 26th right?
6584,"So give it a week (average incubation time 5 to 6 days, 2 to 14 days is about the span ¹ ) to get symptomatic in people after that, another week (median length between symptom onset and hospitalization ranging between 3 and 10.4 days ² ) until they need hospitalization.... end of December is quite optimistic of you."

6586,That can't be right?
6587,Aren't other vaccines developed over years and years of studies?
6588,Considering the health effects the swine flu vaccine had on some people i don't think it's dumb to be a bit skeptic a vaccine that's being developed and distributed as fast as possible.
6589,"I've taken all the vaccines they offer, and i've vaccinated my kids but i'm not gonna lie, i'm a teeny bit worried about this one because unlike the other vaccines i don't know anything about it yet and will read up on why it's safe before getting it."
6590,I'm guessing health care workers and risk groups are first in line so there will be time to read before it's my turn.
6591,This would be the best birthday gift I've ever received.
6592,[removed]
6593,"Never said cases weren't going down after June 18th, just saying were decreasing before that as well."
6594,"You made it seem like cases were only decreasing/low during the summer, which is simply not true."
6595,Everyone should just work Med/Surg floors.
6596,We’ll just send the critically ill patients into the “covid hole” where each RN has 5 actively dying patients and no proper PPE or allied health support.
6597,Since we’re just all going to the low acuity areas of the hospital the new ICU standard is a strict triage of care; we don’t have the staff because everyone wants to work with “asymptomatic” covid patients.
6598,"So, to those 3 nurses in the “covid hole”- three rounds of CPR for each patient max, no pushing code meds, we need them stocked for the healthier patients on Med/Surg that may have an issue, no help turning or cleaning (those techs are needed to help ambulate Med/Surg patients.)"
6599,"Now w me just find like 9 stuck up, holier then thou, superiority complex having RN’s who have to work critical care because of the need to have their ego stroked and rotate them through the “hole.” Who cares?"
6600,If they didn’t want to get PTSD they should have moved to Med/Surg.
6601,"Silly ICU nurses, you wanted to make a positive impact, work as an integral part of the healthcare process to protect human life from our eons old foes of plague and pestilence: what a joke you stupid nurses!"
6602,"You thrived learning everyday, challenging yourself to excel at assessment, monitoring and intervention at a very high level because the feedback loop of learning, applying, evaluating and modifying interventions for the sickest among us really tickled your fancy didn’t it?"
6603,"Well, see here now: because you craved a fast paced high demand environment you have forfeited any right to object to the ongoing and increasing nightmare of communicable disease ravaging our country."
6604,"I’ll say it again, if you didn’t want PTSD you shouldn’t have become a critical care nurse!"
6605,Duh!
6606,"Having no proper equipment, no reasonable break schedules, no coverage for time missed due to covid sickness, certainly no increased staffing levels across the unit to share the burden is your due!"
6607,"You chose ICU, and now there’s a pandemic; so obviously you can’t expect to have less critically ill patients mixed into your assignment during this emergency, you shouldn’t expect staffing more techs, aids, social workers, chaplains and physicians/NP’s to address the drastic increase in acuity and mortality in the unit, you “too smart for Med/Surg” moron!"
6608,"I have seldom heard a more cynical, abrasive, patronizing, victim-blaming take on nurse staffing, stress, PTSD, and burnout outside of an upper level admin meeting between the CNO, the CMO, the next unit manager bucking for that comfy senior management role with the hospital, and the finance, comptroller and Human Resources managers to discuss upper management bonuses tied to keeping staffing under full time FTE levels for the quarter and increased federal reimbursement on patient satisfaction this quarter."
6609,"The hospital has been hiring lots of important roles over the past 15 years, like a new HR position that is “morale and retention focused” - in order to address turnover in the hospital through baskets of chocolates on Friday mornings, half off smoothie sundays at the cafe, and “generic hospital role day” in which one underpaid and understaffed job type/field gets a nice “thank you” message sent out over the PA system and $15 gift cards to Target and free cookies and coffee every morning all week from the cafeteria!"
6610,"Instead of addressing compensation, staffing, workplace demands, daily workloads, decreasing PTO/disappearing vacation time banks, increasing insurance premiums, increased nagging and communication from administration during off-hours, increased demands for attendance at hospital seminars/lectures during time off, constant manipulation of daily staffing levels to reflect patient census almost hourly that increase stress, increases workloads, increased employee in satisfaction, increases unpredictability in a part of the hospital we rely on for support- our co-workers, and on and on and on."
6611,Could we invest in a pension plan that would cover our employees in their golden years?
6612,Sure!
6613,Could we lower our astronomical health insurance premiums?
6614,Sure!
6615,Could we push back against the private insurance industry as a whole which has foisted ever increasing and asinine charting requirements which eat up most of our time in the floor and directly take away from patient care/interaction?
6616,Sure!
6617,"Could we advocate for appropriate pay, hours, staffing, mandatory time off/paid vacation scheduling every quarter, and support our nurses, doctors, allied health professionals when our clinical judgment indicates a patient needs more care, transfer to a higher acuity, a new consultant, two or three more days inpatient to ensure recovery?"
6618,Yeah we could!
6619,"Maybe hospital administration could stop purchasing the newest unproven, untested electronic health record/charting/notation/ordering/Med administration software/hardware/ecosystem and instead invest that money in “people power” and wield this “soft power” to care for, treat, educate, comfort, confront, instruct, evaluate, assess, laugh, cry, connect, etc."
6620,"with those walking ATM’s you now have us calling “clients” that you force us to approach with a script, interact with through a series of menu prompts in an EHR and then eject from the facility at warp speed to clear a bed for the next table of customers?"
6621,"Yeah, no doubt."
6622,"Could we trim the fat from our ever increasing administrative bureaucracy, with positions that address hassling advanced medical providers to ensure that nites are good for reimbursement from the healthcare industry; not really ensuring standard of care, but ensuring that the eve changing requirements built into ICD-10 coding/billing are communicated to and adhered to by staff; or the education department which makes sure that staff are up to date not on the latest advances in medical science but the latest requirements in ensuring federal and private reimbursements are keep at a high level through lowering the “length of stay” or “readmission rates” in the facility, or the admin positions that deal with the implementation of programs designed to increase efficiency and reduce “waste” and identify ways to streamline facility workflows through the application of increasingly esoteric graduate level business school bullshit that takes hours out of staff’s workdays and results in admin justifying reducing FTE’s for a department due to lowered staffing pars and increased expectations of service/census/turnover; or the admin position which oversees the implementation of behavior modification programs to increase patient satisfaction, because patients have to be happy and they have to say so on surveys sent to them after each visit or the hospital misses out on money and as we all know the hospital is simply the cheeriest place imaginable and the location everyone seeks out to have every need met, best food, personal nursing/aid slaves which fulfill every desire, and no medical staff that challenges a patient on their poor knowledge, self destructive behavior, harmful/aggressive actions towards staff because that would make a patient have a frowny face?"
6623,(And what’s a frowny face when the other option is.
6624,"A happy patient who continues their noncompliance with diabetes diet and meds because no one ever told them in a direct and forceful manner the likely horrible outcomes for them and their loved ones, a happy patient like that who fills out a survey with five stars and loses a leg the next year is a win-win!"
6625,"We didn’t have to live up to our responsibility as medical health professionals, the hospital got another review to up percentages on federal reporting and reimbursement and surgical staff booked another amputation resource for use.)?"
6626,"Yep, we probably could look into it."
6627,1% take longer than 14 days.
6628,Some have been known to take over a month.
6629,Well mainly Chinese people travelled worldwide and that’s how it spread to other countries rather than being contained locally.
6630,Thanksgiving is only really celebrated in the US so it shouldn’t cause huge problems for the rest of the world and start this all over again.
6631,I was watching the beginning talks about the pandemic by Trump and by Angela... Those 2 different speeches are night and day.
6632,"Here is the one we got from our leader (with subtitles):

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLxrxyk_wYo"
6633,"I mean, are doctors not explaining the gaps in testing to patients?"
6634,Rip money
6635,Did you ignore the bit about cultural influence?
6636,"Not to mention the fact that as of 2019, 30% of Australians were born overseas, in addition to almost half with at least one parent born overseas."
6637,"&gt; ...cutting its own Quixotic path towards herd immunity via natural infection as the goal

When will we get past this straw man argument?!"
6638,"It's never been true, it it never will be!"
6639,How many times does it have to be debunked before we can get to the real discussion about what Sweden can and should do?
6640,"No Sweden did not have a herd immunity strategy, no Sweden can not legally do a lockdown, no Sweden is not willfully killing all the old people."
6641,"These things has all been said to be true on this subreddit, despite what we Swedes say."
6642,"And when we try to argue against it (and downvote falsehoods) we get to be called ""the Swedish brigade"" or ""Swedish trolls""."
6643,There is still plenty of things that can be discussed about Sweden without spreading falsehoods.
6644,How about demanding masks in situations where it's difficult to keep distance?
6645,Or why the financial support for people in risk groups staying at home took so long to get trough the government?
6646,Or why some Swedish regions thought it was a good idea to reduce the capacity in public transport when fewer people travelled to work?
6647,Or why the privately run nursing homes was allowed to deteriorate so far the last couple of decades?
6648,Etc.
6649,There's loads of things worth discussing!
6650,But we seem to be be stuck in the same straw man argument since March.
6651,It's really 20 million since each person needs two doses.
6652,I would expert it to not have a big impact yet and it should go to the medical staff and others that are most likely to spread it vs the much larger group of those more vulnerable to lethality.
6653,People in nursing homes should get it because the infection rates are much higher and that's really because of medical staff more than anything else.
6654,That's why stopping the spreaders will usually be more important.
6655,There is vulnerability to death IF you get it and there is vulnerability to infection due to your living conditions or career.
6656,"Vulnerability to infection is what we should target and SOME of those people will be the most vulnerable to lethality, but some will just be those most likely to spread it to the most vulnerable because they provide a service they require regularly which cannot be done in a safe way that ensure low infection rates."
6657,"Lethality is down, but infection rate is still quite high."
6658,It seems obvious you want to target infection rate to have the most impact.
6659,"If you have a land border, you can never completely keep the virus out."
6660,"According to reports, even North Korea (the most isolationist country in the world, and a country that no one wants to break into) couldn’t keep the virus out."
6661,"New Zealand is literally an island (well, two islands) and even they couldn’t stop the virus from re-entering their country (and they never did find out how it got back in)."
6662,"That's the thing, COVID can spread asymptomatically."
6663,So someone might be sick even though they don't know it.
6664,I think it was called Normalcy Bias or something like that.
6665,It's exponentially easier to stomp out new outbreaks when you don't have that many cases to begin with.
6666,"You guys did a lot of things right, but the unwillingness to even acknowledge that your geographical advantages played a role is tiresome."
6667,Shelbyville Ky here.
6668,That's not happening.
6669,"leaving the topic, but for Valentine's day specifically, do they really need a designated day to tell their S.O."
6670,they love them?
6671,"Like you said, any day - any DAYS - should work; heck, your S.O."
6672,should know everyday if we're talking words of affirmation.
6673,Interesting as many drugs are prescribed “off-label” for children meaning the clinical trial was for adults but doctors prescribe them to children
6674,I just can't imagine that to be true.
6675,"As shitty as it is, pandemic or not, seeing SNL is a dream for many."
6676,"If people are dumb enough to eat inside restaurants right now, I don't see there being any shortage of those wanting to see SNL live."
6677,Who is above the sheriff if the Governor isn't?
6678,&gt;See you on the other side.
6679,"Well, not ALL of you."
6680,"this page's update is nov 19 2020

6681,is there actually enough population of americans to keep hitting over 200k cases a day without hitting the point that basically every american has been infected?
6682,Joe has recently said the Democrats didn’t do enough for the people over the last couple of decades.
6683,And that’s when he was veep.
6684,That sort of mea culpa is rare among politicians.
6685,It gives me hope that he will be a president for the people.
6686,"I understand being cynical in response to that, but these are fucked up times, and I know he realizes that unless he addresses the underlying issues we’ll be right back here before too long."
6687,We’ll find out soon enough.
6688,so no vaccine then
6689,"*inhales...*

The two vaccines that have already announced their efficacy rates are the BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna vaccines."
6690,"These two vaccines are what's called mRNA vaccines, a new type of vaccine proposed in 1990."
6691,"When initially proposed, one of the benefits of an mRNA vaccine discussed is how quickly they can be developed."
6692,"Essentially, an mRNA vaccine uses ribonucleic acid engineered with the genetic code of peplomers used by SARS-COV-2 to invade cells."
6693,"Once having invaded a cell, SARS-COV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, leaks the genetic code for SARS-COV-2 out through envelope proteins, which command the cell to create clones of that virus."
6694,"Eventually, the cell is inflated by all the new SARS-COV-2 viruses within itself and bursts."
6695,The viruses then continue the process in other cells.
6696,"Eventually, the immune system overwhelms itself by trying to combat this process, damaging the body with a collection of symptoms labeled COVID-19."
6697,"By using RNA to train the body to fight off the peplomers, SARS-COV-2 is unable to invade cells, the first step in causing COVID-19."
6698,"This vaccine is literally just composed of RNA, engineered to help the body create peplomer glycoproteins, which the body fights off."
6699,"RNA, short for ribonucleic acid, is a vital, naturally-occurring acid found within every cell in our body that assists our bodies in creating protein."
6700,Fearing this vaccine is like fearing blood or water.

6743,Nope!

6874,Wearing a mask protects others from YOU spreading the virus.

6905,Friend 2  hasn't seen friend 1 since the 8th so pretty much exactly 2 weeks.

6928,All the Hospitals will have mobile morgues to stack the bodies.....
6929,Will they sign a waiver that they can’t seek medical attention?
6930,Why?
6931,At risk spreaders (potential hosts who act in a way that may spread it) are the ones we need to vaccinate the most to reduce spread rates?
6932,You are looking at vaccines as a selfish commodity and not the medical tool that they are.
6933,Unfortunately the psychology of people who are ignoring the virus and drinking without masks in public and disobeying social distancing is likely apt to lend them to not wanting the vaccine in the first place.
6934,"So no worries, it will probably be readily available to smart people!"
6935,The number of people that think Obama didn’t do enough on 9/11 isn’t zero

6942,Arent anecdotes great?
6943,Thanks for the response friend.
6944,He’s considered high risk with cystic fibrosis (CF) so we expect to hear back from his specialty doctors tomorrow about another test.
6945,But at this point we freaked out our older relatives enough that they’re not coming before next Saturday regardless of new negative tests.
6946,But thankfully dates are pretty flexible if we keep a open mind.
6947,Part of the shock is we expected him getting Covid would be really catastrophic since CF is a serious lung disorder and we have been cautious with our risks.
6948,"We still believe this virus is 100% real, but feeling a little disillusioned if all that worry and no symptoms."
6949,I’ll try not to speak too soon though 🤞
6950,I’m not.
6951,I’m trying to explain that the counties that didn’t do a mask mandate hardly had any cases at that time.
6952,"This info is comparing apples to oranges and the assumptions people are making about population density, initial infection rates, test rates, population changes due to colleges starting, starting dates of K-12 schools, etc are incorrect."
6953,Please look at my comment history to explain what was actually happening in Kansas at the time.
6954,perspective that you seem to be lacking.
6955,You are the person making a claim here.
6956,Your claim relies on using a single value on the low end of the estimates that you provided.
6957,I don't need to give you additional sources because your own sources illustrate that your claim of 70 million already infected and 1.2 million new cases per day is way high.
6958,Isn't that Delusions of Grandeur?
6959,"I voted for Kanye, but he lost."
6960,You realize if we live like that forever.
6961,then it means lockdowns and masks forever.
6962,or do you want to walk around in a bubble forever?
6963,&gt; The only way to have effective restrictions is to have people want to follow them.
6964,That's nonsense.
6965,Restrictions only ever effect people who don't want to follow them.
6966,You completely missed my point and ignored my questions.
6967,Why should I answer yours?
6968,None of these relate to what we were talking about.
6969,"I'm not anti-Vax and get a flu shot every year, but I'm sure as fuck not hopping on board with a barely tested vaccine day 1."
6970,The amount of shit we don't know about its long term effects or even how effective it is makes me cautious.
6971,This is not at all normal for a drug release of any kind.
6972,I've done perfectly fine working from home in isolation for a year.
6973,Hell I've thrived.
6974,I'll just stick to this strategy for a bit.

6977,"If you’re feeling down, please reach out to friends or family or even me."
6978,That is indeed super wrong.
6979,Not everyone who catches Covid is a covid denier.
6980,Just a friendly reminder to others who may have a similar judgement.
6981,These people may not have the luxury to stay home during a global pandemic.
6982,"They may be ringing your groceries, teaching your kids, caring for your sick."
6983,This is not a great attitude.
6984,I know you stopped yourself but want to but out this reminder for other people.
6985,"Not tryna victim blame or anything but like... as dumb as those people are, your company and leadership are just as dumb because they definitely have the resources in place to prevent 1000 people from being inside a store but aren’t utilizing them because profits over people apparently"
6986,"Mask wearing seems to on par with turn signal use, about 20%."
6987,You could jave worded what you said much nicer and it would have been the same affect.
6988,You were very rude to OP for expressing feelings *a lot* of people are feeling.
6989,"Enough people have shown interest in this work that I'm thinking about doing the same thing in a time plot [like this one](https://chartedterritory.us/2020/10/17/americas-third-covid-wave/), which gets pretty crowded but is super informative."

7023,Haha ur right lets just let our healthcare system collapse lol.
7024,These stories and others like it that we have seen constantly from the beginning of this outbreak - remember that tragic New Jersey family- are why people need to just stay home.

7401,"You had to request CERB, and there were eligibility criteria."
7402,It wasn't just handed out to everyone.
7403,"However because there was virtually no verification, some number of people received CERB who shouldn't have, and will likely have to repay it when verification is completed later."
7404,A voluntary repayment scheme was also implemented.
7405,"One criticism of CERB was that it paid a flat rate, and therefore was more than some people earned while working."
7406,"Having said that, the government did also hand out extra money to parents with children, seniors and persons with disabilities, without any consideration of current employment or existing wealth."

7495,"This reminds me of a related article on how the pandemic has not only become normalized, but blamed on the people doing their best to prevent it."
7496,"&gt; Many medics have chosen to leave the profession or take early retirement after the trauma experienced in the spring, while some of those working relentlessly have become targets of aggression as some people vent their anger at the healthcare system over the ongoing pandemic."
7497,"&gt; “We went from being celebrated as heroes to being plague-carriers,” said Giacomo Grasselli, the head of intensive care at Milan’s Policlinico hospital."
7498,"“Now we’re seen as the ones responsible for the restrictive measures, taking away people’s freedom, and the economic consequences.”

&gt; Episodes included having notices with their names on pinned outside lifts in apartment buildings warning them not to enter as they might have Covid, parents banning their children from playing with those of medics, and spouses being barred from shops."

7506,"Testing, tracing, and isolation."
7507,Our testing apparatus is garbage.

7687,"&gt; Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious diseases expert, said Sunday the U.S. could reach herd immunity against the coronavirus ""reasonably quickly"" next year if enough Americans get vaccinated."
7688,"&gt; Appearing on ""Face the Nation,"" Fauci said ""help is on the way"" in the form of the vaccine, but Americans need to exercise caution as the holidays approach and take steps to mitigate the spread of the virus through the winter, saying the country is in a ""very, very difficult situation"" as cases continue to rise."
7689,"Vaccines will be available ""relatively soon"" if Americans can ""hang in there,"" Fauci said."
7690,"&gt; Transcript: Anthony Fauci on ""Face the Nation""
Vaccines produced by Pfizer and Moderna have been shown to be highly effective, but Fauci said herd immunity — the threshold at which enough people have been vaccinated or infected by the virus to curtail its spread — can't be achieved if only 40% or 50% of the population receives the vaccine, Fauci said."
7691,"Polling has shown Americans are still skeptical of a vaccine, and many say they will either delay vaccination or won't get it at all."
7692,"&gt; “What we do need is we need to get as many people as possible vaccinated, and that's why we want to be very transparent for people to understand"" the process that goes into the vaccine's creation and approval, Fauci said."
7693,"&gt;”The FDA will examine it very carefully now together with advisory committees that are completely independent, and declare with the EUA and ultimately a license that the vaccines are safe and effective,"" he said, referring to the process for obtaining an emergency use authorization."
7694,"""When the American public hears that, you should be assured that that is the case."
7695,"And if you get an overwhelming majority of the people vaccinated with a highly efficacious vaccine, we can reasonably quickly get to the herd immunity that would be a blanket of protection for the country."""
7696,"&gt;Fauci, the head of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, also urged caution going into the holidays, as 50 million Americans are expected to travel for Thanksgiving."
7697,"He said the crowds at airports during travel can present unsafe situations, even as airlines try to mitigate those risks."
7698,"There's also a significant risk in gathering with others outside one's household, particularly if there are older relatives or people with underlying conditions present, he said."
7699,"&gt;The increase in cases attributable to Thanksgiving gatherings won't be evident ""until weeks later,"" Fauci said."
7700,Can confirm
7701,Are restaurant workers frontline lol
7702,Internet is actually the problem.
7703,People believe what they read on Facebook more than what they read in a newspaper or tv news.
7704,"And yeah... tv and papers can be biased and skewed, but at least the get vetted."
7705,"If there was no internet every one would watch the evening news, listen to Fauci, and do the right thing."
7706,"Its a bunch of places posting articles on the same dubious paper, not ""many sources."""
7707,The claim in the paper makes no sense as it is far too high a % of the population.
7708,Greater than 10% in a random sample is what researchers were getting in NYC testing after the wave there.
7709,This is saying there should have been a pandemic in Europe in Q3-Q4 2019.

7866,I was arguing with an anti-maskwr earlier and he had 20+ high quality studies showing masks don't work.
7867,We went back and forth about the benefits and limitations of those studies versus the studies that show they do work.
7868,"Many intelligent people are in their media bubble, which does present and amplify those studies, while your media bubble doesn't present them or downplays them."

8267,Sometimes better.
8268,But when I started diving into the literature it seems to be somewhat convincing.

8284,"Take these words and let them ruminate:  USG is not a good system that is producing unexpected &amp; undesirable results, It is a bad system that is producing the intended results."

8445,"I'm betting that most of them figured they'd travel early to beat the rush, then wait a few days to get tested and enjoy a nice meal with family."
8446,Since lots of people are still working from home anyway it doesn't matter what state you are in as long as you can log in and do your work so they prob didn't have to burn any vacation time either.
8447,The Phoenix airport gates were jammed full of people from the video I saw on the news this morning.
8448,We're supposed to be rolling out in-airport testing on Monday with results in 20mins.
8449,"Even if people did pop positive, I doubt they'd make any changes to their plans."

8468,"Not sure, maybe just more time passing and more people getting it without adverse effects?"
8469,One of my coworkers who is pregnant made a good point that it hasn't even been 9 months since they made the vaccine so they have no idea how it would effect a fetus over the course of an entire pregnancy.
8470,"Maybe they account for that during testing, but the vaccine companies absolutely are fucking up the marketing/messaging."
8471,If its so safe then why don't they make a video addressing these FAQ type common concerns?
8472,"To be honest, today I've struggled."
8473,I just had a few moments where I felt very very sad that things will look very different for my girls this year.

8497,Or tried.
8498,I don’t know why so many people - not just on Reddit - have such a hard time accepting good news - that maybe we can get out of this pandemic quicker than we thought.
8499,"Maybe it’s just a desire to not be wrong, and not look like an idiot with their “this is going to last *yearsss*” takes."
8500,"i actually miscalculated anyway, it’s 350k as it’s 50 days away but it 2k per day, so should be an extra 100k people."

8502,TBH I think the mods strike a nice balance.
8503,"And I am sassy person, let me tell you."
8504,On topic.
8505,"While the covid vaccine news is absolutely great news, there are still reasons to be cautious."
8506,"If people use the vaccine as an excuse to give up, as I believe they have been, it's basically going to lead to disaster."
8507,TLDR: Make sure you don't get sick and die this winter before a vaccine is available.^also ^no ^ban ^thx ^this ^helps ^keep ^me ^sane.
8508,Pfizer does not hand the patient the pill.
8509,Pfizer will not be stabbing the patient.
8510,Plans from the states called for federal money.
8511,No money has been allocated or distributed.
8512,Who what where when why how?
8513,Who / why I have seen.
8514,That’s pretty universal.
8515,Hospital / EMT / assisted senior living first.
8516,After that not so spelled out.
8517,"What where when and how seem to be TBD, but that is par for the course."
8518,"&gt; Province Alberta only and land boarder crossing are closed to non essential travel until Dec. 21 and will be extended till

But they want to implement this all over Canada."
8519,"&gt; Also you have to stay in Alberta for 14 days and get tested after 6-7 days 

But you only quarantine until you get the test results of the initial test (you basically quarantine for 1-2 days)."
8520,This means you're potentially spreading the virus all over the community between day 3 and day 8 (when you get the results for your second test from day 6-7).
8521,"you know, I realise thatt those walt disney docs about lemmings running over cliffs and into the sea were staged now, but does anyone else see the similarity here?"
8522,"They have written plenty of anti china anti ccp articles, go spread bullshit somewhere else."
8523,For real.
8524,Many were (understandably) upset at the spread due to Chinese New Year.... but you rescind that card when you do the same damn thing for Thanksgiving (and probably all over again for Christmas)
8525,"They are used to having a two-three years stage 3 trial, and then a few months for the approval process."
8526,So for them a four months stage 3 trial + three weeks approval process is EXTREMELY fast.
8527,"Still, to me, who am not from the healthcare community, it seems slow."

8532,"With how a lot of Americans are behaving, I low-key think we deserve it."
8533,"America, as a whole, got lazy and has spent the last decades living off of past glory and are doing very little to improve us."
8534,"Infrastructure is failing, science is being vilified, and we are devolving into a us vs. us society."
8535,"The masses are getting poorer, the rich are getting richer, and as long as there is a distraction too many are satisfied."
8536,"I feel like we already have been fucked, just more people are seeing it now."
8537,Hopefully more and more have their eyes opened so that future generations don't suffer the same way we are currently.
8538,Can you please explain what you mean by this?
8539,"Yes, teacher here."
8540,"Friday, March 13 was our last day."
8541,It was surreal.
8542,A true Friday the 13th.
8543,You’re very right.
8544,"Now, not to say climbers don’t have risks of being shot or attacked (with nowhere to run because they’re hanging from a pole) especially with the crazy 5G conspiracy theorists."
8545,"But, the amount of human interaction an EMT gets is faaaaaaaar greater."
8546,"Sure I get the downtown towers in bad areas when you have to shut the site down at night and stuff like that but that is super rare, and I feel like the bad area night site risk is very similar to what EMTs have to go through, but all the time, and with your added point of people FLIPPING out that they see someone in a dark shirt with lots of pockets and a badge."
8547,I thought North Dakota was?
8548,Maybe by a different metric.
8549,Whole country's fucked.
8550,Some spots more than others I guess.
8551,Which game?
8552,The only team game with tank/dps/heal I play is Overwatch.
8553,Obvious signs of lying.
8554,Contradictions
8555,This.
8556,Most people are immune for several months.
8557,Lockdowns aren't necessary if everyone wears a mask and properly social distances.
8558,Yea but imagine if both parties shared the same message of wearing a mask and acting safely to control the pandemic things could've been different.
8559,This was a very helpful explanation.
8560,Thank you!
8561,The headline is a bit of fear mongering.
8562,5 million Chinese traveled before we knew what the virus really was.
8563,"Maybe 50 million Americans will travel, but many of them will take precautions because we at least know a bit more now."
8564,It will be interesting to see how bad it ends up being in comparison.
8565,In my case we’re driving with my bf and the pup to a cabin in the mountains.
8566,"Not stopping at rest stops, not seeing anyone."
8567,Just going to hike and relax for a week.
8568,Quarantining for two weeks when we get back.
8569,Our medical infrastructure is shit because having enough beds for everyone isn’t profitable.
8570,"We also didn’t give people enough assistance to stay home, like tons of other countries did."
8571,"You have done enough, your family is safe, good job, sleep well"
8572,People aren't immune for life once they get covid and most vaccines only work if enough people get them in a certain timeframe.

8685,It definitely does.
8686,I don’t like Australia’s current conservative government and have a feeling we would be like the UK if they had there way but all our state premiers (like governors) came together and pressured the PM to take COVID seriously.
8687,Now all the state and territories take part in a national cabinet with the PM so they can coordinate Australia’s approach.
8688,A pandemic is not a time to play partisan politics.
8689,"Statistically, doesn’t China have more people than America?"
8690,"If you haven’t dined out at all, shopped, gone to a gym or visited any friends in the last 10 days (the guidelines say 14, but most studies have shown 10 is likely enough), that’s a great start."
8691,"Most people can’t say that honestly, but if you’re one of the folks who can, you’re starting from a much lower risk profile."
8692,"In the travel process, the place you are most likely to catch COVID would indeed be the terminal before and after your flight."
8693,"People around you are eating and drinking with their masks removed, gate areas are crowded, and mask compliance isn’t 100%."
8694,Restrooms are also high-risk.
8695,"You can help reduce risk some by not eating or drinking at all while at the airport, and by avoiding as many queues as you can."
8696,Find as remote of an area as you can to hide in before boarding.
8697,"Get dropped off at the front door by a trusted housemate, or park close and avoid shuttle buses, trains and rideshare vehicles as much as possible - time in enclosed vehicles adds risk."
8698,"Onboard is also somewhat risky, of course, but counterintuitively might be slightly lower than the terminal:  planes have HEPA filters that exchange a lot of air at altitude."
8699,You can minimize your risk while aloft by declining food and beverage and wearing a mask the *entire* flight...  the highest risk times are while everyone else has their masks off to eat and drink.
8700,Open all the vents over your seat to create an air curtain around you.
8701,"Ideally, wear an N95 or KN95, and fly an airline that’s blocking middle seats like Delta or Alaska."
8702,Be extra careful while on the ground - the airflow isn’t always working at full blast like it does up in the air.
8703,"If you do catch COVID, you likely won’t be aware you had it and were infectious until you return home, at which point it will be too late to protect your family."
8704,So you won’t know if your precautions worked until two weeks later...
8705,If you’re going to disregard the public health guidance and travel anyway - and we both know you probably are - take as many precautions as you can get away with.
8706,"Open windows during your gathering for increased airflow, or pop outside for a while for a nice fire pit time."
8707,Don’t invite anyone over 65.
8708,"Stay at least 6ft away from everyone else, ideally 10ft."
8709,Wear masks if you can.
8710,Have guests use a separate bathroom from at-risk older people.
8711,Keep sleeping arrangements as separate as you can.
8712,"Some tools that may be helpful:

https://www.microcovid.org/ - lets you estimate the relative risk of various activities

https://covid19risk.biosci.gatech.edu - lets you estimate the probability that someone on your aircraft will be COVID infected based on county."
8713,"(Check with your airline for seating capacity, or just use 75 or 100 as a reasonable guess)

Hopefully this was a useful summary, but you may also find the CDC’s Thanksgiving page helpful too:  https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/holidays/thanksgiving.html"
8714,"They followed all the protocols with distance and capacity, how is that different than a gym's cardio room?"

1) The vaccines seem safe, there were no serious adverse effects, and vaccines in general have a very good track record."
8716,It is unlikely to cause harm.
8717,"The biggest question is, does it work?"
8718,How long will it be effective?

8733,The difference is that one was a deliberate attack that posed a threat to our way of living.
8734,And the virus is a temporary thing.
8735,It provides no long term effect.
8736,"So you honestly think every major health organization on the planet is lying to you right now,  forget about before, just right now with mask recommendations, they're all lying."

8739,They're slaves to big mask?

8747,Our ER is 6 beds.
8748,One nurse on duty for an area covering 10+ communities with just under 16k people.

8750,It not easy getting whole families together.
8751,I see mine only once every 2-3 years because of our schedules and distances.
8752,I’m definitely excited to return to an office setting.
8753,I’ve been working remote for nearly 2 years and I was over it after 6 months.
8754,It’s nice it can be accomplished but it will NEVER be a back seat to a thriving in person environment.
8755,Have you been tested for the Full Celiac panel?
8756,"After a few thousand deaths on 9/11, we collectively lost our minds and spent trillions of dollars on a years-long response."

8762,Misleading headline.
8763,5 million people did not leave Wuhan for Chinese New Year.
8764,Guidance by definition is just a recommendation.
8765,There’s nothing to enforce.

8767,"I’m from a neighboring country, and living in Singapore now I would never go back to my home country."

8772,Right.
8773,The vaccine won’t help you if you’re dead or a longhauler before it’s your turn to receive it.
8774,Because there will always be people who will politicise anything to shift blame to someone else to cover up their own problems.
8775,"Stating facts that doesn't align with their political views seems to trigger these types of reactions, but they can't be bothered to explain why."
8776,I am in complete sympathy towards people in the US who suffered from a highly politicised pandemic effort that killed over 260k people as well as the BS that they continue to receive from those claiming that the virus was a hoax.
8777,We finally got out of our 2nd lockdown in Australia which worked and would have worked much earlier had we enforced it back in April instead of October.
8778,I second this.
8779,The issue isn't (just) the lack of beds and ventilators.
8780,The issue is the lack of trained staff.

8786,"I’ve seen 50 million worldwide doses, people assume that’s all for US, it’s not."
8787,"I believe it was 25 million for them, with a 2 dose regimen that means 12.5 million people."
8788,"Add in Moderna’s projections for their 2 dose vaccine, and that rises to 40 million people protected by year’s end in the US."
8789,With vaccine production continuing as fast as possible after that.
8790,"US population is 387 million, so if we can get 40 million vaccinated by mid January that’s a nice chunk, especially since they will do vulnerable elderly and medical staff first."
8791,I don't understand where they think money would come from.

8930,I have an elementary school child and she was actively depressed going to virtual school at the end of the school year last year and the beginning of this year.
8931,"As someone who can work from home, I saw first hand that I’d be on a conference call in a bedroom with the door shut and would get off the call and walk to the kitchen only to find her at 9am in front of the TV."
8932,I asked “what are you doing?” And she said “I have a break”.
8933,I then said “when is your break till?” And she said “I have to get back on the computer at 11”.
8934,My jaw hit the ground.
8935,"When the school board allowed the option between brick and mortar and online, we talked about it and explained that the experience in class would be different with socially distant desks, strict rules, have to wear a mask, no playgrounds, etc."
8936,and in a matter of seconds she enthusiastically said she wanted to go back to school in person.
8937,After 1 day going she was a different kid personality wise and lights up when talking about school now.
8938,She’s been back doing brick and mortar for 2+ months now and it’s been the best decision for her.
8939,I could literally watch her stagnate or regress with the abysmal virtual offering.
8940,"To be fair, the virtual school curriculum isn’t bad."
8941,It’s the complete lack of structure and lack of school environment that is bad.
8942,I believe that’s why virtual school does work for older kids (I did partial online for my master’s degree) where the student already understands the necessary structure and the environment isn’t as necessary.

8981,I always thought it was ironic that health care workers get laid off during a pandemic but that is an unintended consequence of an overwhelmed health care system that has to make room for covid patients.

8983,"On one hand he’s taking a small risk each time he walks into the hospital, on the other hand, there’s some  dark humor aspect that there’s job security for him."

8992,"There still is some risk, but greatly reduced risk."

9138,Because the odds are people like that who are perfectly willing to take that risk will end up taking those same risks in other areas and probably be less cautious than they should be.

9205,At first seeing the governor's / premiers get on TV and supporting stopping the thread was nice but I think most of us are over it.

9365,"We're *also* ""fucked"" because people like yourself care so little about their fellow Americans (and fellow humans *in general*) that you have decided their lives are unimportant and not worth protecting/saving."
9366,But you know your arguments are flawed and that you come across as hateful towards others which is why you make these comments on a throwaway.
9367,Or perhaps it's a nod that you're throwing away your future in which case just because you are find throwing away your future doesn't mean others should be okay with you and others having the same lack of concern for others' future.
9368,it's not just capitalism.
9369,It's freedom of speech that allows for people to spread misinformation and distrust of science.
9370,How about not travel?
9371,There's a chart of what the case increase looks like in [this recent article](https://www.news.com.au/world/europe/swedens-herd-immunity-strategy-has-failed-hospitals-inundated/news-story/374e397d9232036000a1d38548eabff9) (which is worth a read).

9389,After such strict measures put in place with such little notice I’m not too surprised to see people out in force the first afternoon the restrictions are lifted.

9394,"On the other hand, I think it's a false dichotomy."
9395,"We eat, drink, and are otherwise exposed to a great number of chemicals on a daily basis that are less studied than these vaccines."

9398,"I mean, if you've ever eaten a piece of fruit that you didn't soap and scrub yourself, you probably consumed some Roundup, and we very well know that it has bad effects."

9400,"As someone traveling, it has been SUCH a pain."
9401,"We decided to drive 900 miles instead of flying it, we all had to get COVID tests, and we’re specifically booking a place nobody has been to for a while."

9403,"The week after the election, I got my hair cut here in Texas by a Cuban immigrant."
9404,She absolutely was convinced that we were headed down the path to Castro and Chavez under Biden.
9405,I tried to offer some reassurance and ask her what in particular she had seen that had her so worried.
9406,But it seemed like 100% political fear mongering had really taken hold.
9407,"Like, I don't blame you for wanting to avoid the type of regime you and your family escaped however many years ago."

9416,It's pretty reasonable right now actually
9417,I still don't understand Sweden.
9418,"I thought they believed in science, unlike us."
9419,Having a mask that seals well against air leaks and is effective and cleaned properlybetween uses matters a lot more than washing hands.
9420,Though that is a great habit to have.
9421,You’re combining five different news stories for maximum news effect and ignoring the fact that more Americans want the vaccine than French and Swiss citizens.
9422,Not a single American has died from a flame thrower.
9423,It was some dumb rapper shooting a video in Queens.
9424,Bill Gates Shuts Down Coronavirus Conspiracy ~~Theorists~~ Morons That Claim He’s Implanting Chips Into People
9425,I’m right there with you.
9426,I wonder how the airlines are gonna handle seats vs flights.
9427,They can't pack the plane and there is only so many flights that can be taken.
9428,This will be chaotic.
9429,It will be like a whole week of black Friday.
9430,On another note: covid has been really good on my legs on airplanes.

9493,After this holiday season America could hit herd immunity before the vaccine can be delivered to a significant portion of the population.
9494,"Conversely, the 1/15th of people in Chicago with coronavirus likely engaged in higher risk activities and forms of social gathering."
9495,People who have been taking more precautions are more likely to not travel at all right now.
9496,"Meaning the cohort of people at the airport are probably more likely to be “risk-taking”, so they may have a higher proportion than the average population of infected people."
9497,"Combine yours and my outcomes, and the answer is “some of those people have covid.” Haha."

9520,"My mothers husband, his brother, his father,  two cousins and a niece all contracted in over the last three weeks from each other."
9521,All had the same mild symptoms for around four days and then got better  with only the father needed to go to the hospital for one say him being 70 and a 40 year alcoholic and diabetic.

9538,This post was about covid not my landlord.
9539,I felt like I had to provide good reason to fly not an essay about my landlord.
9540,The landlord was in his legal rights.
9541,The lease ended
9542,This is why I keep saying that the history books will ultimately look back on this and blame the American people for COVID spread as well as closing all those businesses.
9543,"The American people are the ones partying, protesting, having gatherings, and refusing to stop Thanksgiving travel."
9544,It just isn't a coincidence that all these new infections are happening 2 weeks after Halloween.
9545,"This isn't Nazi Germany, there is no anti-COVID gestapo."
9546,"Donald Trump, governors, county health officials, and mayors can't send the police into a private house to stop Thanksgiving and parties."

9548,"There was so much news about how serious Chinese New Year's was in China, when their cases were far lower than today's cases in the US."
9549,But there just isn't much news here about Thanksgiving.
9550,"Yah sorry, I will proudly continue going to the gym on a frequent basis."
9551,The fact I go to the gym puts me in a position where I’m not really worried about catching covid to begin with.
9552,Muh freedoms.
9553,"A lot of my friends have been mostly good about isolating and generally being responsible, but they are making plans to travel for Thanksgiving."

9692,"You must have hundreds of millions of well-intentioned folk trying to do the right thing, all being undermined by the selfish 10% who aren't."
9693,Let's hope 2021 brings better tidings.
9694,"Washington here, we just did exactly that"
9695,Only we're giving the blankets to ourselves this time.
9696,Ugh... people are losing it just as vaccines are about to come online.
9697,I could understand people giving up if there was truly no end in sight and saying fuck it.
9698,But we're literally weeks away from the beginning of the end of Covid... and we're going to have an absolutely brutal winter.
9699,What.
9700,the.
9701,fuck.
9702,I think us March babies are once again not getting a birthday in 2021 :(
9703,They can request it from military if needed
9704,Maybe they should spike the turkeys with the vaccine!!!
9705,!
9706,N95 + mask over it + goggles.
9707,"Tbf, it's a lot easier to clamp down when your state has a lower population density than Wyoming, and the whole nation has a lower density than North Dakota."
9708,"Also, it's an island, so controlling what dummies come in is a lot easier."
9709,"The US isn't controlling anything nationally, and the states are open to each other, so even the ones that are trying are getting fucked over by the ones being Trumped."
9710,70 million people are stupid as fuck.
9711,"Honestly, I feel that."
9712,I mentioned not too long ago on here that I was nervous they would find some reason to delay the vaccine and I was called a conspiracy theorist.
9713,At this point I’ll believe it when I see it.
9714,Ohhhhh.
9715,"Yeah I work in a stand-alone, satellite ED."
9716,"Like, it’s not connected to anything."
9717,It’s just 7 ED beds.
9718,So our maintenance is one guy who travels between the sites if they need anything.
9719,"There are 10 of them that are associated with 2 hospitals, because for these EDs you need a hospital to full funnel the patients too then you can build the satellite EDs."
9720,"I think it’s good you have backup tho because we just have me (ct/x-ray), a doctor, two nurses and sometimes an ED tech."
9721,"No respiratory or really anyone we can ask for help like maintenance or security, besides the one registration girl."
9722,Sucks you are so understaffed!
9723,I hope you guys stay safe and try not to get too run down!
9724,Before the pandemic began I had very little faith in my fellow Americans and since then my opinion has only worsened.
9725,Bingo.
9726,"If we do a bunch of things that help reduce the rate of transmission, even if none of those actions completely eliminate transmission, we will still be better off than if we’d done nothing."
9727,"And the more people who partake in these helpful but imperfect efforts, the better the effect."
9728,"See, for example, cloth masks."
9729,Well maybe only partially.
9730,The real answer is moving to Mars!
9731,"Fuck people even if you make the irresponsible decision to go see family fucking drive, grab a few pairs of gloves to use at places like gas station and outside of long distances plan around trying to make it in one day over staying at a hotel, shit it is probably safer to go the hotel route over sitting in a metal tube with people packed around you."
9732,Bill Gates should just shut the fuck up and stop fishing for a Nobel peace prize.
9733,"Yes, he's doing some good."
9734,"But he's as rich as he is in large part  because leveraged Microsoft's monopoly to suppress competition (and innovation), causing prices for customers to be higher than they should have been."
9735,"Yes, it was stealing a little money from a lot of people -- not as dramatic as a big bank heist -- but stealing nonetheless."
9736,"If I stole your wallet and donated the money to some cause *in my own name*, you'd be rightfully pissed: that's exactly what Bill Gates has done."
9737,oh shit lol
9738,NZ and AUs also followed the Asian model.
9739,You would need to suspend the constitution here in the US in order to implement half of that.
9740,"From a governance standpoint, they are commonwealth countries with a parliamentary system."
9741,Whereas the US is a full-presidential republic with a constitution.
9742,Many people don’t realize that the US is unique in being the only G7 or OECD country with such a system.
9743,The constitution is the law of the land.
9744,"Once you suspend that for any reason, all bets are off the table."
9745,"So in closing, I think implementing such a total response would be more trouble than it is worth."
9746,"The fact is, with our large population, we could not afford to screw up in the early days, but we did."
9747,Those were the crucial moments.
9748,Seems totally reasonable to me.
9749,"If you can somehow get a test beforehand, even better."
9750,"If you were isolating 14 days before seeing someone on thanksgiving, you would have taken the test last week."
9751,We're 7 days out and people are doing this.
9752,All the people who decorate their yards with inflatable santa and reindeer will suddenly be yelling about religious freedumb
9753,I'm completely with you on this.
9754,"The government doesn't care whatsoever, and half the population is self centered and stupid."
9755,Thank you :)
9756,Almost nothing would be over kill at this point.
9757,We should have shut the whole country down with real stay at home orders a long time ago.
9758,"People have turned soft anti vaccine, and it's partly political."
9759,I'll take the vaccine as soon as it's available
9760,It’s gonna be over in 6 months or so.
9761,Not worth it.
9762,Without the end close I’d understand it.
9763,21 pounds?
9764,Sounds sus let's keep a watch on this person for having a large gathering!!
9765,!
9766,Noted
9767,"5 million people left Wuhan for Chinese New Year unaware of social distancing, masks, and other safety measures."
9768,50 million Americans are much more aware and ready to handle this holiday.
9769,“Slams” is a little hyperbolic.
9770,"In comparison to other states, Georgia is doing relatively okay"
9771,"Well, they wouldn't have died already."
9772,Most of them probably would've died in the next few years though.
9773,[removed]
9774,"From the article: 

Officials warned that unless the number of infections drops substantially, they may raise the level of social distancing regulations."
9775,"On Saturday, a KDCA official said the country is at “a critical juncture” and could be facing a large nationwide outbreak that surpasses two earlier waves of infections, if it fails to block the current spread."
9776,I’m not going to lie and say I enjoy wearing a mask.
9777,"But come on, is wearing one really THAT big of a deal?"
9778,I feel like people are only digging their heels in for the sake of it.
9779,"Oh, Jesus."
9780,This is embarrassing.
9781,You don't know who he is?
9782,Seriously?
9783,Here's the [full transcript of his speech](http://english.www.gov.cn/premier/news/202005/29/content_WS5ed058d2c6d0b3f0e9498f21.html).
9784,Feel free to read it.
9785,Do you get paid to be a douchebag or is that just something that makes you feel like your life has meaning?
9786,[deleted]
9787,Seems pretty suspect that this one dude could have kept the entire rest of the Trump administration in the dark about COVID for a month or two.
9788,"The worst part is that it's surging BEFORE Thanksgiving, so it's going to be a huge amount of transmission if everyone travels."
9789,People will mingle and infect others or get infected than go back home and infect their household.
9790,I estimate somewhere around doubling daily rates.
9791,Knowing where it came from helps with knowing how humans got it.
9792,"If it did start in Italy, then we've been looking at (and blaming) the wrong animals and people."
9793,[removed]
9794,Exactly.
9795,And it won’t just affect Covid-19 patients.
9796,The whole system will be swamped from the ambulance/EMT all the way through to the morgue.
9797,That heart attack that was survivable a year ago could kill you now.
9798,Maybe the EMT took too long to get to you.
9799,Maybe there just weren’t enough staff in the ER to get to your code in a timely manner.
9800,Covid-19 isn’t kind to hearts.
9801,"Maybe you could have been saved by emergency cardiac surgery, but the surgeons and OR staff were stretched far too thin."
9802,Or maybe the cardiac surgeon you needed was fighting for their life with their own case of Covid-19.
9803,Give money to the unemployed still and things would change.
9804,If I have to pay my bills I’d be going to work rather than worrying about spreading it.
9805,I feel so many people feel this way as well just won’t be honest
9806,How dare you be an adult who can understand if they are sick or not and act accordingly.
9807,"/s

Fucking people out here acting like any two people being near each other will cause COVID."
9808,Again.
9809,You don’t mean everyone.
9810,You mean non-essential.
9811,I don’t need some bureaucrat determining who that is.
9812,"Always easy to spend other people’s money, AOC."
9813,Be more original next time.
9814,Cleverness is highly underrated
9815,"If the elderly are vaccinated by Jan/Fen, by March we shall see very few deaths hopefully"
9816,India has 133k deaths and is one of the better performers world wide.
9817,I don't think you know how the numbers work.
9818,"Thats intense i hope everybody stays healthy, especially the kids"
9819,I've had zero flu or URTIs this winter.
9820,The hygiene measures and social distancing has kept me far healthier than I would normally have been.
9821,"Not being sarcastic, I wish I knew how fucking charismatic and awesome these people's families are that they're desperate to hang out with them."
9822,Even the family members I like are just kinda okay.
9823,That makes things even worse.
9824,"A household with a single ""middle class worker"" would almost definitely fall into under 1000 yuan/month per capita."
9825,And you think these people in the countryside are working their fields and small shops are earning a wage?
9826,They earn whatever they can sell.
9827,Minimum wage doesn't apply to them.
9828,When was the last time you were in rural China?
9829,Your comment would benefit from including the data/facts that support your position.
9830,Nature
9831,"Yes, my point is that, with covid being as ubiquitous as it is now, America has absolutely no contact tracing."
9832,So it's completely impossible to prove it gave it to you; since you can't demonstrate who the first person to spread it at work was.
9833,"Similarly, smoking can cause lung cancer but there are a shit ton of complicated factors that lead to cancer developing so it's very difficult to prove it caused the cancer."
9834,"We were until Trump fired the people responsible for ranking us #1 in pandemic preparedness, or have people forgotten about that?"
9835,I had to fly a few months ago due to a family emergency...
9836,The person in front of me on my noon flight ordered 2 beers.
9837,Like really?
9838,Afternoon flight in the middle of a pandemic and you need to take off your mask to drink some fucking Heinekens?
9839,We’ve got a redneck sheriff here in Ohio who’s declared he’s not enforcing the governors orders on a mandate either for masks or a curfew now.
9840,This country is headed for chaos and disintegration over sheer fucking stupidity.
9841,https://www.fox19.com/2020/11/17/butler-county-sheriff-im-not-going-be-curfew-police/
9842,"All I can say is I can't wait until this subreddit will no longer have a major purpose, as much as I love this subreddit, I'll just be so relieved when the pandemic subsides."
9843,"While there will still be cases around, it will not be as bad as this probably this time next year and I won't have to hear about a permanent ""new normal"""
9844,[deleted]
9845,"I really enjoyed reading your reply , thank you ."
9846,I too look on New Zealand as a Utopia .
9847,A countries leader should be intelligent and compassionate.
9848,"Our federal leader is a religious lazy buffoon but our state leader is the best , he refused to bow down to federal pressure to not lockdown and instead listened to our doctors and scientists and that’s why we are on day 23 of no cases or deaths ( affectionately called here double doughnuts 🍩🍩) Anyway i hope you do get to move to NZ and have a good life"
9849,How long until the virus makes it back to china from americans?
9850,"No one is saying it started there, only that it was present there in September."
9851,"With how interconnected this world is, it could have started anywhere."
9852,The article is a little misleading.
9853,Check the sources someone else posted.
9854,"Yeah because communists spread germs, not capitalists."
9855,/s
9856,"&gt; Yes, I do trust the US numbers unlike many edgy Redditors."
9857,You can literally look at excess deaths and see that the US numbers are off about by about 30%.
9858,"But hey, basic numeracy is edgy or something I guess."
9859,Mate I was saying it was good because compared to most of the rest of this world it isn’t normal.
9860,I’m glad it is being done.
9861,Well ok tbh I haven’t followed the development of the English usage of these slurs too closely.
9862,"But I don’t know I heard in the U.K. being used relatively commonly, while racial slurs are not and nobody would use them."
9863,"Nvm, I’ll delete."
9864,Definitely photoshop
9865,I mean if you're under 30 it's more like 0.03%.
9866,"From there a majority of the people who are hospitalized, let alone die, are generally unhealthy already with obesity/diabetes/etc."
9867,On top of that like 40% of cases are supposedly completely asymptomatic.
9868,Plus how many people had mild symptoms for a couple of days and never got tested?
9869,The number of actual cases is probably much higher (and the mortality then much lower).
9870,"Honestly if you're healthy and young, driving to work is more of a risk."
9871,"Why weren't we telling people to see their families over the summer then, if they knew damn well that people are going to gather?"
9872,"Plenty of people were shaming others for having outdoor BBQs, going to the beach, and 4th of July gatherings, not to mention the attitudes towards the protests, back when the spread was far lower than it is now."
9873,"The time to start thinking about what to do for Thanksgiving was back when cases were stable, not in the middle of a rampant outbreak."
9874,"The problem is Americans, and a lot of other Westerners, don't plan far ahead."
9875,And you say one holiday as if anything is going to be that much safer for household mixing by Christmas or even New Year's.
9876,"The CDC wasted months not advising in case of rampant outbreaks during the winter holidays, just like they've wasted so much time during that  I personally broke my isolation period over the summer (yeah, yeah, I'm sorry complete isolation for several months takes a toll on my mental health) because I knew damn well a second wave was coming around October, but the CDC apparently didn't."
9877,"Frontline healthcare workers will absolutely be first, as early as mid-December."
9878,- Elderly by January/February.
9879,- Then the “high-risk” people in the general public in March.
9880,- Then the rest of the general public in April.
9881,- Hopefully the entire population by June/July.
9882,Just my best guess at this point.
9883,"China got hit first with no prior knowledge (no treatment, no diagnosis, no prevention)."
9884,The virus hit them right on winter then their lunar new year.
9885,"They have 1,4 billion people."
9886,Yet now here they are with the virus pretty much in control.
9887,"I'm not talking about how they interacted with the international community, but they are rightfully a success in containing it in their own country."
9888,What's wrong with that?
9889,Let's hope these aren't the same folks who publish work that is about to change cancer treatment but it never shows up.
9890,Maybe the largest one?
9891,Or read the article?

9909,When was this?
9910,I was just at Ohare last weekend because I had to be and I didn’t see a single person not socially distancing or not wearing a mask at least (like when boarding).
9911,"Well COVID-19 has already spread, soooooooo ..."
9912,It's like the wave in Interstellar that they thought was a mountain in the distance.

9929,My local Publix sells them in very manageable sizes.
9930,"I've never looked at the packaging to see if they have reheat instructions, but I'm sure it's feasible."
9931,Very weird title.
9932,The negatives of the things you described are limited to ethical questions regarding animal cruelty and an arbitrary sense of what parts of the animal you think are appetizing.
9933,The negative of eating bats and anteater penises is that a novel coronavirus developed in humans and spread across the world.
9934,I don't give a fuck what you want to eat if it is sanitary.

9939,Did something I say offend you to where you had to resort to fallacious argument and name-calling?
9940,Yeah that's a whole 15 dollars more than my local wholesale club is charging members for turkeys this year.
9941,I didn't vote a straight ticket.
9942,I voted Democrat for the Presidency but for a Republican on a couple other things.
9943,I was trying to go with who I thought would be a better leader and not on party lines.
9944,"Voting your conscience is a bad idea nowadays apparently, you are supposed to vote your party and that's it."
9945,I am also registered as an independent and I've taken flak for that as well.
9946,I want to try and judge candidates on who I think will lead better.
9947,"I wish more people would vote independent because enough votes means that a third party will get funding next time around, and actually a platform instead of all the media coverage dedicated to the two main parties."
9948,However I do understand why people didnt want to use their vote this time around on an independent.
9949,Both sides feel it is vitally important to get their guy into office (or keep their guy in office) and don't want to waste their vote.

9955,"Just because you use a slur to describe someone who is not associated with that slur, doesn't make it less insulting to the people who are associated with it."
9956,This needs to be higher.
9957,The fact that they are treating this different that a flu mean that the experts know this is a big deal - wish everyone did as well.
9958,Yes!
9959,It was scary?
9960,Not really and not scary now either.

9969,"&gt; At this point, the majority of the East thinks of the majority of the West as brutal, callous, selfish, and stupid."
9970,That its values aren’t fit for the 21st century.
9971,"That people are egotistical and narcissistic, unable to think of others."
9972,"That it’s flunked the test of civilization, which is to protect the most vulnerable first."
9973,"Ok, and so what is “the East” going to do about it?"
9974,Gloat about themselves in whiny articles like this?
9975,"Fine, go ahead."
9976,"Also, just because the East has a lower number of deaths, I still absolutely do not believe their official COVID death count numbers compared to the death count numbers from Western countries."
9977,"Yes, I do trust the US numbers unlike many edgy Redditors."
9978,"*almost normal*

What do you think isn’t back to normal, and how long until we get that back to normal as well?"

9983,What a great mission they're on!
9984,I remember though that we were told a narrative that China implemented their initial lockdown for 60+ million people in advance of Chinese Nee Year in order to stop the spread.
9985,"Also, where is the data for this 5 million leaving even coming from, as well as the data of 50 million Americans traveling for a holiday that is yet to happen."
9986,Maybe.
9987,The virus did just turn 1.
9988,Wasn’t that the consensus tho?
9989,Y’all need the bum gun.

9992,We are glad for that also.
9993,I’m Aussie and I’m so sick of people saying it was just because we are an island.
9994,We all isolated when required.
9995,I remember when they sent messages to everyone saying we had to not go outside of our cities (QLD).
9996,And how did we manage it?
9997,We listened and acted and quarantined and closed our state boarders.
9998,We STILL have a field hospital up and ready to be packed out in Brisbane and we haven’t had a local case in a month or more.
9999,We are absolutely prepared at every stage.

10045,How do we go about fixing it though?
10046,Voting isn't the answer and the current corporate and government stronghold needs overthrowing.
10047,Leadership is half of the issue.
10048,The collective culture is the other half.
10049,"We shouldn't act like citizens are totally blameless, and spreading the disease isn't their fault unless they are in office."
10050,"There are other cultures in the world who would not tolerate US leadership, never-mind vote for it and whose behavior in comparison to ours would reduce the spread and casualty rates."
10051,"US culture compared to other first world cultures straight up is bad at handling things like this, regardless of any politicians or the economic system."
10052,These things all inform and influence one another.
10053,You make a lot of assumptions
10054,By spring or summer it most likely will be.
10055,The whole “two weeks to slow the spread” and “ok just two more weeks” was a fruitful attempt to initially get things under control.
10056,Why do you have to bring politics in everything ?
10057,This is an actual issue with society and your blaming people when you should be blaming our shitty ass government.

10070,Your guess is way too low.
10071,Around the end of the summer they had 10%+ of the US pegged to have been infected.
10072,I would assume we're closing in on 20% soon (actually we probably surpassed it or are about to).
10073,They're estimating 400k-500k actual infections per day right now.
10074,"So each week we're ticking off 1% or so at this pace, and as we know the growth is exponential until the peak."
10075,Still not close to herd immunity which doesn't even exist to coronaviruses or most infectious diseases (not without an eradication effort through global vaccination like we saw with Smallpox).

10229,You have a point.
10230,But AFAIK the majority of hospitals are not overrun with covid patients.
10231,Mainly hospitals in densely populated metropolitan areas are experiencing this problem.
10232,I may be totally wrong idk.
10233,Flattening the curve in order to prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed is a solid argument for limited shutdowns.
10234,I think the question should be framed as lives lost vs. livelihoods lost.
10235,"By choosing overarching lockdowns (all ages, all health levels) we are saving a few lives by sacrificing many more livelihoods."
10236,After all the survivability is greater than 99%.
10237,"In fact it’s 99.997% 0-19 years, 99.98% 20-49 years, 99.5% 50-69 years, and 94.6% for people 70+."
10238,These numbers are directly from the CDC.

10333,"Now they are even enforcing a ""25% or 75 people max capacity rule"" and now every grocery store has an hour wait to stand outside because the state closed 2 of our handfull of grocery stores in my town for having too many cases."

10361,Both the  Pfizer and Moderna are 2 shot vaccines administered a few weeks apart.
10362,"That means there needs to be 600 million doses to do 300 million people in the US alone, and about 7 BILLION people world wide."
10363,That is going to take a long time to manufacture and distribute.

10702,"Which ""common sentiment"" are you referring to?"
10703,"My argument is very simple, didn't present any criticism of the FDA, and has little to do with what you wrote."
10704,"One cannot asses the effectiveness of the current FDA process with regard to COVID-19 vaccines, solely by looking at how much of an improvement it is compared to the ""normal"" speed."
10705,This is just a logically flawed approach.
10706,"What needs to be done instead is to examine what in practice is happening during that process, determine whether all of it is justified, and see if there is any room for additional optimization."

10755,Don't let other people's stupidity or shittyness prevent you from taking steps to better yourself or our world.
10756,My advice is get your 4 year degree from your local state university (or one in another state that you'd prefer if you can establish residency there before applying).
10757,"They give discounts on tuition to in-state students, and even without those, you can get a comparable education for a fraction of the cost of a private school."
10758,"Just remember that if you do want to enter a decent medical school you'll need to take certain courses like bio, anatomy and physiology, organic chem, etc (and you'll need good grades)."

10760,"Oh well, my first statement stands at least."

10775,People are giving up on all this.
10776,Luckily i have family in town (and no one is flying in) but could still easily do one holiday without seeing everyone.
10777,We have become desensitized to it.
10778,Why are you all travelling?
10779,This is literally one single year where you needed to skip your traditional holidays so that we can keep this from exploding.
10780,"The vaccine is around the corner and will likely be distributed by this time next year, so it's only a single year you had to sacrifice."

10796,There is still a lot of post vaccine release work to be done and data to be released.

10805,Zero.
10806,Nope.
10807,Prisons are much higher risk because of crowding due to underfunding and over sentencing.
10808,When society locks someone up like that they take responsibility for keeping them safe and so prioritizing vaccine to mitigate the unsafe conditions that have been created there by society’s own penchant for long prison terms for non-violent crimes is important from both an ethical and also pragmatic stance.
10809,That's good to hear.

10822,Married at age 24 to my High school sweetheart.
10823,Retired at age 59.
10824,That happened here in my county in Colorado.
10825,Our numbers were astronomical before flattening for a few days.
10826,"When we thought restrictions were helping, we saw our infection/positivity rate continue to rise."
10827,"When public officials couldn't hide the facts, they said it was a backlog in testing and a shortage of supplies."
10828,Our numbers have since shot back up.
10829,When I was a kid I saw that movie in theaters.
10830,I wanted to work for the CDC for a few years after because of it (I didn't realize you couldn't be shit at math if you wanted to work as a top scientist ha).
10831,It frightened me but also instilled my love of zombie/contagion horror movies.
10832,A few months back I tried to rewatch it and it definitely didn't have the same enjoyable quality.
10833,Why do you feel the need to make up an excuse not to attend?
10834,“No” is a complete sentence and the state of the country is the excuse.
10835,"I have 15 family members planning to gather in my aunts tiny little 1,000 sq ft house for thanksgiving dinner."

10845,I am interested in what happens in North Dakota.
10846,Almost 10% of the population has had a confirmed case.
10847,"But their testing doesn't seem too overwhelmed, with positivity around 15% (from what I have seen)."
10848,Their daily cases seem to have levelled off (albeit at a high level).
10849,I wonder how long they can/will continue at that level.
10850,Nope.
10851,"Thanks to that, America can't do shit right."
10852,Um...that is usually how car crashes work
10853,It ain't over yet.
10854,"Transmission will peak on Dec. 21, but cases, severe cases, and death will peak after that."
10855,I’m just basing my reply on what Dr Anthony Fauci said.
10856,He said the vaccine may not stop person to person transfer.
10857,"So even if your immune system is able to neutralize 99% of the virus once you recover, and you will not get sick again, that 1% still opens the possibility to shedding the virus and infecting other people."
10858,So it’s less about your own safety but more about helping to stop the spread.
10859,Godspeed.
10860,Hope you and your family recovers quickly.
10861,I have accepted that what I think is not going to change people's behavior so I don't worry about what they want to do.
10862,I might think some of it is needlessly risky -- packed clubs being one example and cruises being another -- but if it's in their risk tolerance range and legal I don't worry about it.
10863,"I go out for a haircut every other month, and that's riskier than other people are willing to be."
10864,I also see my mom and stepdad every month.
10865,I have housecleaners and other contractors in my house.

10872,"eh, I disagree."
10873,I assert that gold *is* a currency.
10874,"I can buy things directly with gold by the ounce or subdivision thereof, and I can also buy any currency in the world with gold."
10875,"The value of gold is tracked just as with other precious metals, just like currency."
10876,"This suggests an exchange rate, something only applicable to currency."

10885,Depends where you live.
10886,"In my area they're so desperate that they're doing on-the-job training, no previous experience or college degree needed."
10887,"They're expected to process so many tests a day, every day, and expected to process them all times of the day and 7 days a week."
10888,They need as much help as possible.
10889,"Yes, I agree on both counts."
10890,Cultural differences in both conformity and the fear of illness.

10918,I hope they get drinks spilled on them.
10919,I hope they rack up a huge bill.

10945,"The policy of ""let it spread at a low level"" followed in September by the policies of ""let it spread at a not so low level"", then at medium level, then at high level lead to us having it at a almost-to-'ing-high level in Germany."

11011,Long-Term effects beyond 8 weeks have been demonstrated to be prevalent in just 2-2.2% of symptomatic cases.
11012,"That number is heavily leaning towards the older age brackets, as the long-term effects are the result of an overpowered cytokine response doing damage to our own bodies."
11013,The long term effects are nowhere near prevalent in younger people to warrant such concern.

2020 Covid19: 255,830 deaths"
11376,"&gt; EVERYONE gets treatment at a hospital

The problem is that this is not a true statement."
11377,The hospitals are going to have to ration care and choose who lives or dies.
11378,"No one who did everything right, who wore masks, who stayed at home for all but the essentials should be left to die because some idiot who called it a hoax and spread it to others gets treatment instead."

11384,It’s pretty silly to think that schools don’t serve additional roles beyond the basic function of teaching children.
11385,"Sure, schools don’t have giant billboards that they are “warehouses for children”, but again, in reality, they do provide a safe place with qualified individuals to watch them for a controlled period of time."
11386,"As such, millions of people use them for this “warehousing” so they can work."
11387,"If schools had no concern for the fact that parents work then they wouldn’t offer before school care or after school care programs so working parents can, you know, work."
11388,The whole crux of this is that for decades schools have served an unofficial role of providing care for children while parents work.
11389,At a moment’s notice it has been suggested and been instituted to shut schools down that have provided these roles.
11390,There are impacts and ramifications for doing this.
11391,My point way up in this thread is that the decision to close schools needs to be taken in an entirely different light than just about any other type of mandated closure (i.e.
11392,closing a bar is NOT the same impact as closing a school).

this is the fastest that any drug has ***ever*** been pushed through creation, human testing and approval to market, and people SHOULD be worried about that...bad shit happens when things get rushed, and something as serious as this needs a LOT more testing before it should ever be approved for use on literally 100's of millions of people, perhaps billions...I, for one, will not be touching the vaccines until I see how others have reacted to it for a good length of time...I do not trust something that was created and rushed through in a matter of a couple months, while MOST medicinea/vaccine/etc generally take years of trials before being approved for public use

&amp;#x200B;

11486,And I do agree with the theory that Sweden's divergence from their neighbors contributed to higher death rates next door unfortunately.
11487,I remember stories in the summer from The Local about pressure from Sweden not to be excluded from Nordic travel bubbles but how reason eventually won out and Sweden was left out specifically due to their death and infection rates.
11488,"And yes, it's shocking and sad."
11489,"I've spent years referencing Sweden's leadership in traffic safety and car seat safety in particular, and watching the government follow anti science policies is just...strange."

11504,"If we had found a way to isolate/quarantine all people over 50 years old, either through education or incentives, the toll would also be close to 85-95% less."
11505,"That's something that wasn't tried, maybe because age discrimination of any kind is against Western principles."
11506,"So that's my recommendation for the next pandemic if early lockdowns aren't possible or palatable - massive age based incentives/opportunites to stay home and shelter in place - ""If you're over the hill, we'll pick up the bill""."

11531,"Nobody else in this town, or that town, is doing that.“

Of course this means that when they come into the restaurant where my husband works, there’s no telling with they bring with them, but then, any restaurant, in order to stay open, can only insist on
so much."

11586,"&gt;“This suggests that while everyone appears to have increased their recognition of the situational causes of poverty amidst the pandemic, only for those who actually recognized the negative impact of COVID-19 on the poor did this change in attributions for poverty actually translate into decreased support for inequality and increased support for government intervention to help the poor.”

So more people understand that it's not your fault but they still don't think you should get any help."

11599,Those were the more populated counties in the east of the state.
11600,The non mask counties were more out west and very lightly populated.
11601,"At the end of this study, there were 20 counties in the non mask area with less than 10 total cases each."
11602,Three counties had one case each.
11603,"Two of those got their one case that week of the ending of this study, the other one had one case before July 1 and didn’t get another one that whole time."
11604,"Also, Wichita is in Sedgwick county."
11605,Wichita is the largest city in the state and they had a mask mandate while Sedgwick county didn’t.
11606,"They counted towards the non mask county increase, and accounted for 44% of the increase in those counties."
11607,"Similarly, Hays, Salina, Manhattan, Emporia and other cities had mandates while their counties did not, and these are the major hubs of commerce on their areas."
11608,"Also, that week this study ends, 7 or 8 colleges started and tested every person arriving on campus."
11609,This accounted for a large amount of the non mask spike as well.
11610,"This is not the straightforward “mask counties good, non mask counties are stupid” everyone is making this out to be."
11611,"Yeah, our facility for some reason took lean to mean never order anything until the item fully runs out, so then we have to buy the product through our contracted supplier, and then also have our sister location overnight us a week's worth of that item, of which we would also have to pay for."

11624,How is it not yet clear to you when all northwestern hemisphere countries just got a seasonal reprieve and then seasonal resurgence.
11625,See you on the other side.
11626,"Private business, I’m the CEO and Founder."
11627,"Let’s say the US has actually 30,000,000 real cases to date."
11628,"(just for the sake of my argument, could be way more could be less)

If 500,000 people are infected a day, and we need 70% of the population to be infected, that would mean there would have to be another 210,000,000 infected people."
11629,"To reach that number at 500,000 cases per day, it would take 420 days to reach heard immunity."
11630,Now of course certain areas will reach that 70% level a whole lot faster than the country as a whole.
11631,But we would still be a very far away from heard immunity.
11632,That doesn't mean that you don't have the virus.
11633,You can still have it.
11634,Negative tests don't mean anything at all.
11635,Besides you didn't have the virus at the time of being tested.
11636,You can get it as soon as you touch the door handle on the way out.
11637,"I am practicing a lot of restraint, should prob start a journal...so much anger reading this."
11638,People who spend two hours preparing their easy mac at 12:00 M-F have no clue.
11639,"I read that we ordered nine doses per person, that's a lot!"
11640,I had the virus.
11641,I’m a threat to no one.
11642,Congrats!
11643,I hope you have a happy life together.
11644,Is that born part out of the “American Dream” where if *you* work hard enough you can achieve your dreams?
11645,"Just stay home for 3 weeks, you can go out after that."
11646,I can't believe people are selfish enough not to stay home for 3 weeks.
11647,It's now week 35 of 3 weeks.
11648,I’ve had similar thoughts about them.
11649,They at all costs won’t admit they are wrong.
11650,"And that, will ultimately lead to their undoing if they continue."
11651,Tests don't mean anything.
11652,Because you can get the virus as soon as you are walking out the door right after getting your test done.
11653,&gt; Antibodies may decline but that’s ok because...the body still remembers.
11654,Not when the virus mutates.
11655,&gt;Recent studies show that immunity likely lasts for years.
11656,Provide a link of reputable quality.
11657,&gt;This is NOT the plague.
11658,It is very not deadly in comparison.
11659,The black plague of Europe is still around today and people still get sick from it.
11660,Only difference is that medical science is better.

11667,there is no treatment.
11668,"the grand majority of the people who ""survive"" after being in the hospital would've survived anyway, and the ones who were really sick might last a few weeks longer in the hospital intubated, but will succumb anyway"
11669,[removed]
11670,Same - and there needs to be more analysis on these sort of things (too much speculation).
11671,"Bottom line, don't go to gatherings."
11672,Yes.
11673,Our baseline stupidity is a bit higher.
11674,Lmao a little silly to downvote this.
11675,And Chris christie and ben carson
11676,Also in the same ballpark as vaccine results.
11677,"What's not known is whether level of immune response affects it, whether certain people just unluckily fail to make the right immune response the ""first time"", whether a higher viral dose is responsible and so it could happen to anyone just less often, or if any combination of the above is true."
11678,I like the part where they don't talk about how much it will cost the company to manufacture and distribute.
11679,"Pharmaceutical companies aren't in the charity business, and they aren't going to operate at a loss just for the sake of public relations."
11680,Worse is that a good portion of the money paid out in government contracts will go into war chests for future lobbying efforts.
11681,Also there will inevitably be complications with the widespread distribution of the new vaccines.
11682,There will be freak deaths.
11683,I imagine government contracts will protect the companies from possible liabilities.
11684,"Exactly, they pretend it won’t."
11685,"They know better deep down, but they have to play along with the narrative to keep up appearances with their people."
11686,They may even convince themselves by repeating it often enough.
11687,"But in an honest moment, they know."
11688,They just don’t care.
11689,"And that the masks, while helpful, are not 100 percent effective."
11690,I think r/sciende supports your view - a few weeks ago a study found that people who have rough/unsafe home conditions become more conservative and less open to new ideas.
11691,People need safe and good material conditions to open up to progress.
11692,Yes... well... no that's not accurate.
11693,But that's how the data was reported.
11694,I checked the data by hand and Puerto Rico is just really bad at reporting data.
11695,"For the last few weeks, they've reported an equal number of tests and positive results."
11696,"I almost dropped Puerto Rico from the data set, but... they need some love."
11697,"They always get forgotten (That being said, I did drop a few other smaller US territories)."
11698,Just watch.

11719,"Yep, they have, but if you know anything about stats, that doesn't change the rate for that demographic."
11720,Where is your aunt being stored at in the meantime?
11721,I'd rather have her cremated or buried instead of being stored in a cold place somewhere.
11722,"STFU, it’s not that bad."

11732,It's not perfect but testing is much more effective if widespread.

11740,"And I think while it is important to slow the spread, we can't just ignore the fact that people do need to spend time with others, not just for our general well being but also for our physical health."
11741,And that is very good that you both are quarantining and getting tested before.

11750,"And if you're afraid of paying teenagers or students a ""living wage"" make a student wage."
11751,Regulate business over a certain size to have a minimum number of full time employees with full benefits making a living wage (and punish companies that do the bare minimum or violate the spirit of the laws).
11752,Or ban hiring for cheap during school hours.
11753,A lot of people have this idea that anyone can do certain jobs especially low paid jobs.

11921,It would have been a total loss.
11922,The average middle class voter who is happy with their life and doesn’t want massive change to potentially wreck their plans wouldn’t be too stoked with massive changes that could cause social upheavals.
11923,Bernie wanted to raise a wealth tax on anyone with over a 32 million (or some other number) net worth.
11924,Sure on paper that’s great for equality but what’s stopping those multimillionaires from simply taking their fortunes and moving to other countries happy to have their investments and businesses?
11925,I think Bernie sanders policies would have caused brain drain in our country and this would have had terrible effects on innovation and employment.

11941,O'hare was my layover
11942,Last time I flew the guy next to me sipped on a drink for 90% of the flight.
11943,"I don't think he was even swallowing, just putting it to his lips."
11944,They think they've found a loophole to not wear a mask.
11945,Where’s your source for that claim?
11946,"Yes, it's nationwide news every time we have a case."
11947,"We know where they're from, where they got it etc."
11948,"Most cases are border arrivals who are all in quarantine anyway - but we had a couple of community cases a week or so ago, (as in someone in the general public unconnected with the border) it was major news, they closed the CBD of our largest city, contact tracing for all the locations those people visited."
11949,They do genomic testing to find out the likely source of the outbreak - yes basically which strain.
11950,It's a huge deal here.
11951,We have mandatory masks on flights and public transport now also.
11952,"We've been living ""normal"" life for most of the year and nobody wants to fuck that up."
11953,I don’t read propaganda
11954,[removed]
11955,"You really nailed the entire situation with this comment, I agree 100% with everything you said."
11956,What a complete catastrophe we are in with it getting more insane every day.
11957,So frustrated with the deniers!
11958,CNN shouldn't do that.
11959,It won't help the current situation.
11960,"Instead, CNN and other news organizations should campaign for Twitter, Facebook reform and for Fox News and OANN to lose their broadcast permits."
11961,"Fox news isn't a terrorist organization, but a fear mongering one that has hurt our society."
11962,"Healing begins with the end of Fox news, and to help people dissect their feelings."
11963,We need to stop hating our own country men.
11964,"However, I don't think Biden will kill Fox, and we'll have a situation where Trump does nothing but criticize Biden for 4 years, and people will really buy into it."
11965,I do hope that Trump is banned from all social media.
11966,And for mediocre steak
11967,Do keep in mind the footnote on the data.
11968,I've checked some of these with the state archives.
11969,"North Dakota, for instance, is correct at 15%."
11970,"Wyoming, however, is reporting 6.8% on their website."
11971,The insanely inflated 57% is due to data inconsistencies that are hard to track down.
11972,Did you even read the article?
11973,I think the solution is counties that follow the mandate ban all non-residents from entering the county.
11974,Obvious exceptions for supply trucks and the like.
11975,I think they probably have refrigeration trucks ready to start shipping them out to hospitals and pharmacies around the country.
11976,I doubt we’ll see any HUMVEEs or MRAPs out on the streets doing the deliveries.
11977,Its free free if you go to target and other stores.
11978,They even give you a 5 dollar gift card incentive lol.
11979,Herd immunity requires a whole lot more people to be infected before it becomes effective.
11980,"I'm liberal-leaning, I've been working from home 12hrs a day for weeks as has my boyfriend, and on the rare occasion I leave the house to pick up food or something I wear a mask and sanitize like crazy."
11981,"I'm having an in-person Thanksgiving with my parents (who live pretty locally), out on their patio with heaters 10ft apart."
11982,"We won't touch or go inside, and all of our food will be prepared individually ahead of time."
11983,"Are we entitled, and stupid, and reckless?"
11984,"(I know you didn't say that, but I'm just responding to some of the overall judgment towards people taking every precaution to see their family for the first time in nearly a year.)"
11985,"In the beginning of this, I was very critical of anyone leaving their home for non-essential reasons whatsoever."
11986,We all had to work together to flatten the curve.
11987,But now there's no coordinated plan.
11988,People are  out there taking precautions trying to keep businesses afloat and not completely destroy their mental health.
11989,"This could continue on for another year, we have no idea."
11990,I'm no longer judgmental and resentful towards people who feel like they have to return to their lives somewhat as long as they're taking all the guidelines seriously.
11991,And I'm not going to restrict myself from going outside or seeing loved ones responsibly either.
11992,I hate Trump more than words can accurately explain but a broken clock is right twice a day.
11993,I also am not a fan of TikTok and it's not like I download TikTok just because Trump also doesn't like TikTok.
11994,Thank you.
11995,I really appreciate the quick response and information.
11996,This is quite impressive work!
11997,Thank you for sharing.
11998,They do this in America at Targets
11999,Yep and I have no sympathy for anyone that votes against their own self interest.
12000,This is as close to natural selection as we have in the modern world
12001,"&gt; deeply ingrained the anti socialism goes here

Hatred towards the poor and obsession/worship of the wealthy is deeply ingrained in American culture."
12002,"Wait, I thought this was all supposed to disappear after the election?"
12003,Guess we should have fucking listened to the infectious disease experts who have spent their careers understanding viruses instead of the fucktards posting about it on Twitter.
12004,I graduated nursing school in May and started as an ER nurse in July.
12005,"I don't have much experience, but already I am tired."
12006,"I'm tired of the ""Hero"" talk  meant to placate the people working on the frontlines."
12007,"I'm tired of people telling us it's ""bullshit"" that we can't let them stay with their loved ones in the hospital, and I'm tired of people minimizing the risks of the virus."
12008,"If everyone took this seriously it wouldn't be so terribly frustrating, but no, we have to make it about our selfish ideas of personal freedom."
12009,"Fuck you to your very core if you spread information downplaying the threat of the virus, and fuck you if you lack the common decency to wear a fucking mask in order to protect your family, friends, and community."
12010,It's pathetic how difficult it has become for people to do something so simple that could have such a significant impact on the course of the pandemic.
12011,&gt;we've been looking at (and blaming) the wrong animals and people.
12012,"The ""blaming"" part is what worries me most."
12013,"We know that bats, camels, and civets can carry and transmit coronaviruses [https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/which-species-transmit-covid-19-to-humans-were-still-not-sure-67272](https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/which-species-transmit-covid-19-to-humans-were-still-not-sure-67272)."
12014,"Also dogs, cats, and mink, have been known to contract Covid."
12015,I think further study into which animals can host and pass this and other viruses is more important to preventing future outbreaks of new strains and/or other respiratory diseases.
12016,Maybe it's just cause I live in the states and I have seen the harm people blaming countries has done to the science.
12017,Best wishes and stay safe.
12018,p.s.
12019,thanks for being civil in your response.
12020,I often get accused of being a halfwit for stating this contrarian view.
12021,Gday mate.
12022,15 days I think for NSW.
12023,I literally have a doctor traveling with me
12024,"Hope for the best, prep for the worst"
12025,"You’re right, but that guy said “America deserves COVID” so he’ll get the upvotes, maybe you don’t understand how much Reddit hates the US."
12026,Target paid me $5.
12027,Or Republicans.
12028,That’s true but you can still criticize China for withholding information at the beginning and hold our own leaders accountable.
12029,There is no reason for us not to do both!
12030,The issue shouldn't be political.
12031,The point is to mitigate the spread of coronavirus.
12032,A mask helps with that.
12033,Use a polearm and claim self-defense.
12034,Fucking thank you.
12035,The “I’ll wait a few months” mindset blows my mind so much
12036,The Asian countries were well prepared thanks to their experience with SARS-1.
12037,They knew right away what to do.
12038,"I mean, these plastic bags are super hard to open (especially if the store also gives out disposable gloves)... but that’s no excuse."
12039,"Just rub your fingers on something moist, there’s tons of that in a grocery store"
12040,Dont forget you need two shots.
12041,Bingo.
12042,"There is no analysis here, just opinion."
12043,You didn't have to shave before.
12044,"Calm down, and please seek mental health services"
12045,Damn You’re a cool dude thanks so much
12046,So delusional.
12047,Publix is in America.
12048,Yup.
12049,"If there’s one thing that living in a few different countries has taught me, it’s that humans are just as dumb everywhere, they just get more news coverage in the US."
12050,And in 100 years we’ve advanced to the point that we do the exact same thing they did - wear masks.
12051,It would be funny if it wasn’t sad.
12052,A/s/l?
12053,I am totally serious.
12054,Stop acting like you are the only older person on reddit.
12055,And if you don’t think fundamentalism hasn’t grown in the past 20 years you actually might have dementia
12056,Would you trust anything the confederate supporters say about the US?
12057,I recall reading last winter/spring that people with both were more likely to end up hospitalized &amp; in the ICA in China than those who only had one or the other.
12058,this is why many countries have been encouraging people to get the flu vaccine to prevent double infections with worse outcomes
12059,"*slinging clam chowder to old ladies*

I have no idea why but I am uncomfortable with this statement..."
12060,The Deep South also just delivered Georgia and has some of the highest poverty rates as well as high concentrations of minorities.
12061,"Don’t hate the Deep South entirely because there government is ridiculous, hate the lack of federal assistance to get them out of their negative feedback loops."
12062,"It’s just really classist to throw out the whole Deep South, there are a lot of people here."
12063,Something like 40% of AL usually goes blue
12064,"Your locale based problem, versus planet wide medical issues for much of the population?"

12078,"Yes, most people can find someone for a day to watch their kids, but every weekday for over a year?"
12079,Nope.

12091,They're not anti vax or alarmists.
12092,Just skeptical
12093,This is what I kind of envisioned the military's role in all of this cause anyone can call FEDEX and say they need a package delivered thank you.
12094,Changing the topic eh cuz you are losing the argument?
12095,Good idea!
12096,You wouldn’t be able to come back.
12097,Cut your loses and try again!
12098,Obviously they didnt poll Congress......
12099,"We'd need research to know for sure, but strains like the danish mink strains have been under harder selective pressure without much effect to immunity, so it's probably unlikely this would make much of a difference to vaccine effectiveness."
12100,Definitely keep your eye on animal reservoirs in the long term.
12101,Lol can you give heart disease to others by breathing on them?
12102,If you’re going to do a troll account you’re supposed to be clever.
12103,Maybe not evil but they do have the most punchable looking faces.

12108,[deleted]
12109,That's a fair request.
12110,I'm not anti vax nor am I rushing to take the vaccine.
12111,It's normal to be cautious of a new vaccine
12112,I don’t disagree.
12113,America and the west messed it up.
12114,But it’s doesn’t excuse withholding info at the start
12115,"Hospital I work for said the priority will be:

1) staff of long term care/nursing homes, since their patients have a much higher fatality rate and can be otherwise isolated
2) hospital staff (not mandatory at this point but I think it will end up being)
3) any vulnerable person (so elderly, secondary conditions)
4) general public"
12116,I think that's what a lot of folks here tend to forget.
12117,"From my own experience, I've seen people take the virus seriously all the way until August/September, then eventually they just stop."
12118,Many people start seeing covid as this thing that's just mentioned on the news.
12119,"If they don't know anybody who's gotten it, or has been taken to the hospital, it can be easy to forget about."
12120,"I'm not saying this is a good thing, but it's human nature to adapt and just live with things if they have to."
12121,"The response most people should have is ""if Trump says a vaccine is good that doesn't mean shit for whether or not I take it""."
12122,"So Trump telling people to take a vaccine wouldn't do much to persuade the left to take it, but if said Vaccine is recommended and approved by the FDA, WHO, CDC, Fauci and pushed by politicians like Biden, Pelosi, AOC, Bernie Sanders etc."
12123,people on the left won't have much reason to reject it.
12124,[removed]
12125,"We'd need another year or so to even approach those levels, and would saturate our capacity to care for the sick well before then."
12126,"Plenty of people to still get sick for months and months yet, we could easily hit another doubling of case rate (and that would break the backs of many hospitals) before the winter is over."
12127,"My only silver lining in that is that Thanksgiving may be bad enough to keep people from doing the same thing a month later, only more so because ""Christmas is important""."
12128,Even worse in the lungs.
12129,Don’t ask.
12130,It appears people learned nothing from China cancelling Chinese New Year
12131,Agreed

12141,Just get ready
12142,They had 96 deaths 3 days ago.
12143,I’m used to it at this point.
12144,I almost always sort comments in threads by |*Controversial*| just because that’s where I generally find more unbiased viewpoints.
12145,Nice.
12146,That includes the Moderna vaccine.
12147,I assume they both get approved and 40m should then be the number.
12148,"Nobody seems to know how many more doses we're making monthly,  which is probably even more important."
12149,How do you figure losing 900k is going to make a millionaire homeless?
12150,That doesn't make sense.
12151,"By this logic, you assume everyone that will ever be a millionaire is going to buy some super expensive house or other super expensive crap."
12152,No that's just ignorant to say it like that.
12153,"Someone who by definition is a millionaire, needs above a million."
12154,"They could lose 900k, own a 45k house."
12155,And still be barely okay and in a home.
12156,"There's a great effort made to disguise/invisible-ize the huge governmental assistance and benefits programs geared toward the middle class while at the same time publicizing, politicizing, and making humiliating the governmental assistance and benefits geared toward the working/poverty class."

12170,I recently recovered and did an antibody test which came back positive and a negative covid test.
12171,"Not sure how long my immunity will last, but I’ll definitely see if I can get vaccinated."
12172,"This virus can literally ruin you for a couple of weeks, in addition to the long term effects that take time to heal."
12173,Pot calling kettle black here.
12174,"so I'm just curious, if there's 12 million confirmed cases in the US, there's probably at least 60-80 million actual cases."
12175,how much impact should we expect 20 million vaccinations to have on the pandemic?
12176,it seems to be ramping up quite quickly.
12177,"could this round of vaccines put the fire out, or does it take more time than that?"
12178,"Not only did they downplay/stall at first, they put a lot of pressure on WHO, EU etc not to restrict air or land travel, thus ensuring speedier early international spread."
12179,Facts.
12180,"May have been due to pure incompetence and childish face saving, but there was plenty of ""nothing to see here""."
12181,"Mind you, this doesn't excuse all the other governments who could see this mess coming off the planes and did nothing...for months"
12182,"This only proved one fact, 
There are more dumb people in West than in East."
12183,New York had an outbreak in March.
12184,How long did it take THEM to figure out asymptomatic people can transmit covid?
12185,Or that the virus was airborne?
12186,At the same time making sure their hospitals don't collapse?
12187,The beginning of this was chaos.
12188,"They may have delayed telling the world for maybe a month due to not understanding asymptomatic, incubation time, designing tests, keeping their hospitals from tanking, getting PPE."
12189,But then they locked down in January and this step was basically a guys shit is hitting the fan move.
12190,They locked up 8 billion people.
12191,Everybody basically stayed home for three months.
12192,"And yet armed with this information, we just praised Xi and sat on our hands."
12193,"He literally took over the CDC single handed lay but go off, liar."
12194,Yeah.
12195,Very well was probably a bit of a stretch.
12196,They certainly haven't staggeringly failed though.
12197,Taiwan is full of anti China propaganda they can't be trusted.
12198,"Same here, I stocked up 2 weeks before the rush, partly because my mum lives in Christchurch where they had that earthquake and I realized that the need to stay home for 2 weeks and not need to go out for anything could strike at any time."
12199,[laughs in Vietnam’s and China’s vastly lower death rates per capita]

12206,Two are seriously immunocompromised.
12207,"One is my mom, in her 70s."
12208,"One's pregnant, and the last one is her husband."
12209,"And me, the guy who works in mass transit daily praying none of his people get sick."
12210,I'm seriously considering telling them no and making up a story that one of my co-workers tested positive.
12211,"It wouldn't be far off (we had to quarantine one person already because he had been exposed, but tested negative and was out for a week quarantined for good measure)."
12212,"This will kill thousands more, both from travel and from people mixing where they desperately shouldn't for the sake of a family gathering that can be followed with another one for the funerals."

12216,"And honestly, it never changed here."
12217,"People here are glad it's all over, and our cases are at an all time high."
12218,Unfortunately people are unable to act in the best interests of those outside their immediate circle.
12219,Absolutely people need to care for those close to them but doing the token yearly visit all at the same time in the peak of the pandemic (so far) is just not a good time to do it.
12220,Dying in a hospital without visitors +/- a tube down your throat is a pretty shit way to go as well.
12221,Reschedule.
12222,Do it another time of year when the hospitals aren't already overwhelmed.
12223,Use technology.
12224,You can care for someone in creative ways that are more meaningful than a token dinner.
12225,"The real issue is the US has had no guidance, no responsible adults to make the tough decisions."
12226,You can't contain it but certainly it could be controlled more.
12227,The worst is already inevitable and at the moment it looks like things will get much worse than that and it'll go on for months.
12228,Spare a thought for healthcare workers this Christmas.
12229,I work in grocery retail for an independent that mostly sells in the natural channel.
12230,Many manufacturers are reducing their offerings and focusing on their top 15-25% dollar earners.
12231,"So while the supply chain is mostly in-tact, there is less variety on the shelves in some categories."
12232,"The article mentioned there are ripples in the supply chain, which I would agree with."
12233,"The chain relies on many people, and when people get sick, things slow down."
12234,"There is also a shortage of packaging materials such as jars, cans, and plastic containers."
12235,"Some vendors have everything they need to make their products, but not their preferred containers to put it in."
12236,"Related, we usually sell flats if mason jars, but have been unable to source them for several months now."
12237,"I am, and I understand completely."
12238,AMEN
12239,funeral homes have been raking in the cash all 2020
12240,"I wouldn’t consider those “very well”, but certainly passable especially when you consider the response to economic downturn in terms of wage subsidies and such"
12241,"&gt; And with just a bit of discipline

Full blown lock down for months is more than ""just a bit of discipline""."
12242,And add Ken 'You can't close schools during a pandemic' Paxton and the hamstringing TEA to that list.

12256,It really does look like it's going to get worse and worse until the vaccine saves the day.
12257,What a failure of human cooperation.
12258,No you haven't.
12259,great point!
12260,I'm not the one dismissing other people's problems here...
12261,"lol OP you're actually right and redditors cannot handle being wrong

Every redditor is an armchair XYZ-ologist and thinks they have an IQ above the median"
12262,That’s a good point.
12263,I hope we can determine if previously infected people don’t need it and then save them for other people.
12264,Would really cut the timeline down.
12265,Guerilla marketing sounds right up your alley 😊
12266,European here.
12267,Can't agree more.
12268,"It requires discipline, whether it's a little or lot."
12269,Don't attack the smallest aspect and miss the main point.
12270,Many Americans don't have the discipline to do what's needed to manage the corona virus.
12271,Why not try to learn from the mistakes and the successes of other countries?
12272,Instead Americans are saying that it's their right to do what they want and that they don't need to follow the corona virus regulations... How does that affect the next person?
12273,"If you're all about taking pride in your country and it's people, why not take an hour of inconvenience (at best) by wearing masks when you're out."
12274,How about not traveling and exposing yourself to many people.
12275,Why not do these things to keep yourself and your fellow country people safe?

12277,It will come.
12278,But children really do have much less risk of serious complications as far  as we know.
12279,The problem could also be solved with more empathy rather than fewer rights.
12280,He has first hand access and review to the data.
12281,He has a pretty solid background in dabbling with medical science.
12282,Sorry I’m gunna go with the scientist on this one.
12283,No kidding.
12284,I know a woman who makes teddy bears.
12285,"She has made a big deal out of calling herself an essential worker because kids are having a hard time with the pandemic and teddy bears make them feel better, hence she's practically a first responder."
12286,but that's not what was said here.
12287,we aren't close to the end.
12288,"that's what was said, and your response to it is this."
12289,"be realistic, and don't start being unsafe because you think we are near the end when we aren't."
12290,"The absolutely scariest, most chilling part of that analogy is that 200,000 cases to him is *the wind* of the tornado, not the actual monster itself."
12291,Things are bad right now but we haven’t seen how truly terrible this is going to get
12292,"The average age of African residents is barely 20, and they don't have an obesity epidemic."
12293,"There's probably millions of asymptomatic cases throughout Africa, but the overall youth of the continent results in a very low death rate compared to the rest of the world."
12294,well .. the virus will surge more.
12295,I am not going to travel any time soon.
12296,"Heck, we even decide to do a virtual thanksgiving."
12297,"But if others want to take risks, it is their freedom, as long as it does not affect me."
12298,I can't get other to stay home ... so the only thing I can do is to avoid crowds as much as I can.
12299,At least we have amazon and doordash.
12300,"It won’t help at this point, anyone who isn’t convinced yet will just call that “fake news”"
12301,And what’s the problem with that?
12302,Slow and steady wins the race mate... we will get there one step at a time.
12303,Pfizer has begun trials on children and so has another one (I think J&amp;J)
12304,Things are a lot easier when you can execute with impunity the people that don't listen to you.

What do you know that the top epidemiologists and vaccine developers, don’t know?"
12308,"Seriously, I wanna know."

12328,But the military isn't delivering vaccines FedEx and UPS are and they bungle deliveries all the time.
12329,"I'm not sure most people know this, but the vaccines are for adult consumption only."
12330,Kids - not even those below 18 but apparently small children - make up one fifth of the population of the US.
12331,"Therefore, any talk of ""not everyone needing to vaccinate to slow it down"" now becomes, most all adults need to vaccinate because there's nothing out there just yet for our kids."
12332,As a parent of a toddler I just assumed we'd get three needle pricks.
12333,Appreciate the info and suggestions.
12334,"Same rule here currently, I'm the only one allowed, need to bring everything possible needed, can't leave and come back, and they cant provide me with food."

12337,"Pepperoni sticks, yogurt, trail mix, drinks, crackers, etc."
12338,"We're not worried about Covid at the hospital, the problem has been family members that don't understand we're in a pandemic."
12339,Upset with us that we haven't gone in anyone's house since March.
12340,Upset they won't get to hold the baby although they do whatever and go wherever the please with no care for the current rules.
12341,"They're not worried about getting the baby sick, because they would hold the baby in a second if you let them, they're just worried about missing out on holding it."
12342,"So, we're going to lock down for the winter, do our thing, and we can visit them in backyards again in March or April when it's nice enough out."
12343,Let's just settle on 'they're malevolent.'
12344,and unknowingly be asymptomatic and pass it on to someone who dies from it or has a serious case from it getting it from me because I am less than 65 and in good health.
12345,you're (not) a good egg...
12346,Dude was ahead of his time.
12347,I agree.
12348,Hospitals are still in crisis.
12349,"Pfff, this government seriously, no wonder why we wasted money on expensive lock downs not because they don't work but they don't do it well."
12350,"Ok, let's reduce taxes and get rid of healthcare."
12351,"Might as well get rid of education, police and fire services :) capitalism will fill the void."
12352,The person who I replied to asked a question and I answered.
12353,Most people I know are over this.
12354,Everyone that I know who caught it haven’t died and only experienced mild symptoms.
12355,"I’ve been in many situations during this pandemic (going to the beach, spending time around family/friends, and traveling) and I haven’t been sick once."
12356,This virus doesn’t make me and most people afraid enough to stay in the house all the time.
12357,Deal with it.
12358,Brushing your teeth goes against your human nature.
12359,Going in for medical check ups goes against your nature.
12360,Having to go out of your way to eat a balanced diet goes against your human nature.
12361,Shopping inside a grocery store rather than gathering/hunting/foraging outside goes against our human nature.
12362,We do things all the time that goes against our human nature.
12363,That's what makes us higher beings then animals.
12364,We can override the Natural part to do things we think need to be done: from brushing our teeth to building cities.

12366,"Anyone saying ""Yeah but it goes against our human nature"" has never seen the majesty of the Great Pyramids."
12367,We can go against our nature and accomplish an 8 Wonder Of The World: socially isolating the world over to beat a global pandemic.
12368,"Perhaps, when this is all done, we can put a series of reflective satellites at geosynchronous orbit to act a new Constellation in the sky to mark those we lost and the sacrifices we all had to make to beat this heinous killer of mankind."
12369,"Ooh, peel back the skin a bit and now we know what you are."
12370,No longer trying to help you.
12371,That is an excellent point.
12372,Administering vaccines does not make you a scientist or specialist.
12373,"In death toll, it will be substantial."
12374,80% of covid deaths are over the age of 65 and a good chunk of the 50 million Americans in that demographic will be protected by the end of the year with near universal coverage in the first few months of 2021.

12391,"Fuck you, I didn't do shit to you and you talk to me like that?"
12392,Judging by how you spelled centre- perhaps other countries do the tests differently.
12393,Here in the US the nose swab is standard - same for flu.
12394,Vaccines take years to perfect.
12395,We should be doing everything we can now to slow this.
12396,Your attitude is part of the problem
12397,I have told so many people a negative tests means absolutely nothing.
12398,It is possible to test positive within hours of a negative test.
12399,And your life-long medical lockdown in no way compares to the struggles of European Jews during World War 2 trapped in basements and attics and camps in constant fear of persecution.
12400,So maybe you're the one who needs perspective?

12413,Our prime minister was hiding in fridges and dodging meetings for months.
12414,We weren’t required to wear masks until 5 months after the original lockdown.
12415,"Airports weren’t closed and we still aren’t testing at airports, only being asked to isolate for two weeks if returning from certain countries."
12416,Our contact tracing systems have been a waste of time and £12 Billion (with a ‘B’).
12417,To be honest I’m surprised our numbers are as low as they are.
12418,"The last few days the average has been ~2,000K/day."

12421,thanks for the explanation
12422,YES.
12423,I'm so tired of all of the covid deniers and people calling this fear mongering.
12424,Those people need to be denied medical care.
12425,"If they think this is no big deal, then they can deal with it at home by themselves when they get infected with covid, or if they have some other medical emergency that hospitals have no space to deal with."

12441,"C: If you read the article you will know that it was not forbidden to host Joshua Wong, he just needed a police permit since he was holding an political event."

12467,Thank you for your wisdom mr president
12468,antimaskers at it again
12469,The main reason is that a test gives information about the level of the virus at one point in time.
12470,A person could be infected but not have enough virus yet for it to register on a test.
12471,"Or, a person may become infected in the hours or days after taking a test."
12472,"Also, the tests do not have 100 percent accuracy."

12483,That picture is from March when the borders started closing... At least you got the airport right I guess.
12484,They didn’t test all 304 people.
12485,There may have been more than 7 people infected.
12486,"But at least in this case, all 304 people were quarantined."
12487,"If they hadn’t been, then significantly more than seven people may have been capable of spreading the virus across their country."
12488,My husband is on day 8 of a quarantine right now.
12489,"He’s been tested in total so far 15 times, most of them for work, and the last one was 24 hours before he flew, like several of the people in this article."
12490,"Nobody he flew with has been identified as having Covid, and he has never had any Covid symptoms."
12491,"But still, we wait one more week before he can go out in public, and before I can sleep in the same room as him and join him for meals."
12492,"It sucks in a lot of ways, but I like that our country does it this way."
12493,Testing is not a substitute for quarantine.

12562,In some way its nicer to have a huge reason to not see family with a newborn.
12563,Newborns are stressful and you're all learning about each other and what each other means when they do things and how to get what you want from each other.
12564,Family just thinks they know better and add pressure to perform better and know what the baby wants better and its a fucking nightmare.

12611,The problem is that a negative test doesn’t mean you’re not infected.

12706,Lawmakers and hospitals administrators compete to purchase basic supplies leading manufacturers to jack up prices.

12763,"As bad as Trump may be, he is in no way even remotely comparable to Hitler or Mussolini."
12764,Seriously.
12765,A human being.
12766,The US currently has around 12.4 million cases and the still rapidly rising 7 day average for new cases is at  approximately 173000 new cases per day.
12767,So even without the amount of new cases rising anymore around 6.75 million additional new cases until the end of the years.
12768,Considering that you need 2 doses of the vaccine which should I believe be 20 days apart at least this years the vaccine will hardly have any measurable influence on the amount of infections.
12769,So around 20 million cases in the US are easily possible until the end of this year.
12770,And that are just the confirmed cases assuming the rate of new infections does not change.
12771,Currently it is rapidly rising.
12772,Add to that the undetected infections and the fact that it will still take a while before a vaccine becomes widely available I would guess 70 million is completely realistic.
12773,Just 70 million?
12774,As I always say — I'm not optimistic or pessimistic.
12775,I'm realistic.

12778,"However, the talk of a vaccine being very close seems to give a lot of people the sense that we are out of the woods."

12795,Do we know about getting the vaccines while pregnant or nursing yet either?
12796,I have a newborn and have to go back to teaching in person again when maternity leave is up and I'm hoping to not need to quit pumping milk to get the vaccine.
12797,Even better would be if the milk passed on some amount of protection.
12798,I imagine there will be plenty of healthcare workers otherwise at the front of the line for the vaccine who might be pregnant or nursing and I hope no one lacks the opportunity to get it because of lack of data.
12799,For what purpose?
12800,It seems trump is attempting to use China as some kid of sheild from criticism.
12801,And calling it the Chyna Flu just spurred attacks against Asian Americans.
12802,Trump withdrew the American pandemic experts from China years ago so he's really to blame on so many levels.
12803,The world knew years ago that China is a likely hotspot for new viruses.
12804,Even Hollywood knew when making the movie Contagion.
12805,Which is why the west had people on the ground in China to help contain it.
12806,But Trump fired those guys.

12858,At the moment we're about even (per capita) if you look day to day.
12859,"US still rising though, whilst Europe has stabilized and may be going down a bit."
12860,"If you look at the totals from the start, US is still doing worse."

12869,"Leaving it to ""personal responsibility"" is clearly an abject policy failure."
12870,Turns out millions and millions of people are recklessly irresponsible and selfish.
12871,And this was entirely predictable.
12872,How do you know they’re lying?
12873,So you are telling me that there are much more important issues than getting people to wear masks?
12874,I was already freaked the f out after watching China build hospitals in days.
12875,I stocked up the last 2 weeks in February.
12876,But I wasn't the only one because I noticed disinfectant wipes and hand sanitizer were scarce.
12877,My last in-person day of work was the last day in February and it freaked me the eff out to be meeting so many people in-person.
12878,I wouldn't shake anyone's hand.
12879,And after that I was hermited at home with my stockpile.
12880,So I missed the craziness March 11.
12881,I had already been going crazy but it was awful because everyone else thought **I** was crazy in February.
12882,Now the craziness outside finally matched the craziness I had felt alone on the inside.
12883,Every country has a border.

12888,Reddit takes any opportunity to cry about this every day.
12889,"Yes it’s a highly contagious disease, but forgive me if I’m not too concerned with a disease that 99.7% of all people survive."
12890,Kind of like every other sniffle and cough you’ve ever had in your life.
12891,I guess other people’s problems that aren’t COVID don’t matter as much.
12892,working is something very different from going on a short vacation on thanksgiving
12893,[removed]
12894,Things are just getting started.
12895,The deaths we’re seeing now are from infections that took place roughly 4 weeks ago.
12896,4 weeks from today things are really going to be messed up
12897,You’re right of course.
12898,I actually thought Europe was doing well compared to the USA.
12899,Are they not?
12900,Well it's been found in semen.
12901,So figure that out
12902,I'd say Reddit is right in that assumption.
12903,"As for the French, they're up there too except they didn't invade Iraq which gives them a +1."
12904,Sadly most of mine have passed on.
12905,Guess I deserved it huh?
12906,This article is bot written Chinese Propaganda.
12907,I have zero faith in any statistics from that horrid regime.
12908,"It wasn't fun being in lockdown, but I'm glad we got it under control."
12909,With this many infections per day we're bound to get a mutation soon which will invalidate the vaccines currently being produced.
12910,Then we enter 12 Monkeys or Songbird territory.
12911,They will still die eventually
12912,So those doctors who were arrested for warning about Covid never existed
12913,It’s also not too late to take it seriously.
12914,It just takes a real commitment to it.
12915,It’s essential to get laid /s
12916,"Omg, this is clever"
12917,There was never a “national” shutdown.
12918,It was always a state decision.
12919,So most likely the democratic-led states will shut down while the republican freedom-loving states will likely stay open
12920,You know what?
12921,I've been pretty much at home all day long since March.
12922,And the reason I have to do this is because other people say it's too inconvenient to stay home for a month.
12923,This is selfish and dangerous.
12924,"Yes, it sucks."
12925,But it's only as bad as it is because of the people who won't do their part for a short time.
12926,I'm kind of over feeling bad for the people who are making everyone suffer because they have to go out to bars.

12947,"The Chinese vaccine is a traditional  inactivated  virus,  which causes the body to respond to nonspecific disease proteins, whereas the western vaccines all specifically target the spike protein that COVID uses to infect cells."
12948,Therefore these vaccines are likely to be.
12949,More effective.
12950,90% of the deaths come from &gt;65 population.
12951,The vaccine must work for them.
12952,They all should be taking the vaccine.
12953,"the right have been so successful in the west over the last 20 years in completely eroding any trust in  government that people seem to equate the vaccine with them

12971,"While I agree it would have prevented MANY of the 250k deaths, I also think most Americans would have flipped the fuck out."

12990,For us in Europe it will be.
12991,On a serious note I recently learned that Biden can expand ACA with an executive order in the case of an emergency.
12992,Americans might want to look into that.
12993,The masks are not the difference between success and failure lol.

13007,The US has thousands of cases per day and the population seems resistant to any major government action to control it
13008,Oh I can tell your whole family is real excited to have video call holiday with you
13009,&gt; A few months isn't going to magically come up with new horrible problems that we didn't see before.
13010,A significantly larger number of people getting the vaccine could certainly find something not found before.
13011,The trial didn't include people with every conceivable pre-existing condition.

13139,If the anti vax fuds exceed that number than covid is still going to be a problem for our economy even after the vaccine.
13140,Lmao
13141,Yea but the shutdowns are still by the govt.

13154,"Most of us are doing shorter lectures (our students aren’t watching them anyway) and have to makeup instructional time with more assignments (which allow us to see if students misunderstood something, gives students practice, forces students to keep up to date with the reading and lectures, and provides more low-stakes assessments that aren’t just exams)."
13155,"It’s literally a requirement for accreditation, but it’s also a useful mechanism that theoretically should be making things easier for students."
13156,Many of us are surprised to hear that students would prefer a three hour lecture and three multiple choice quizzes instead of 1.5 hour lectures and some low stakes assignments alongside the exams (so if you do bad on an exam your grade isn’t as badly affected).
13157,"It sucks because we’re struggling with ways to help students beyond just going “ok you don’t have to turn in anything!”

13499,Those folks didn't do shit besides party.
13500,It's natural selection at this point
13501,For what reason?
13502,Are the ones not wearing masks excellent at social distancing and all other safety measures?
13503,"*Void where prohibited, exclusions may apply."

13505,I'm sure that's the plan.
13506,"I was reading yesterday how a lot of the time needed for vaccine development isn't due to actual work by researchers, but raising funds, recruiting enough volunteers, and pushing the paperwork through bureaucracy."
13507,"Part of the reason the COVID-19 vaccines moved so fast is because all the drug companies, governments, and researchers basically dropped everything else and focused on the COVID-19 vaccines."
13508,It's amazing what you can do with bottomless funding and the worldwide attention of the scientific community.
13509,I pay taxes and my US insurance is $400 dollars a month.
13510,I also have copays at clinics and I have a deductible I have to pay as well before my insurance covers anything.
13511,I'm told my insurance coverage is one of the better ones.
13512,Is canada like this at all?
13513,"Whatever - I'm just telling you what the article said:

""The 40 million doses the military will distribute is enough to vaccinate approximately 20 million Americans.  """

13516,That is true literally everywhere in the US.

13521,"I will admit, I've done the ""heavy breath"" through my mask to moisten my fingers to open a plastic bag."
13522,"I've also wiped moisture off produce to do it (and then bought said produce, I'm not a monster, I was already planning to buy it)."
13523,"I feel bad about that, because if I'm sick (I'm not, but everyone says that) I worry that it can transfer via touch."
13524,"But it's that or buying nothing, last time I bought pre-packaged stuff it was already starting to go bad, more money for worse produce."
13525,How was the first time incompetence?

13529,Gotcha.
13530,One of my sister’s sons got sick a week and a half ago and tested positive.
13531,"Her husband was sick, too, but refused to be tested."
13532,So she did the smartest thing she could think of.
13533,"She took her youngest son on a 4 day mini vacation, while the two were sick, leaving them to fend for themselves."
13534,She came back Monday and had started exhibiting symptoms and tested positive by Wednesday.
13535,So she was definitely already contagious when she decided to go on her vacation.
13536,One of my friends from church is elderly and has a lot of underlying health conditions.
13537,"He’s on a ventilator, the doctors can’t keep his oxygen levels up even on the ventilator, and he’s unresponsive."
13538,The doctors told his wife that he *will not* make it and they *will* lose him unless God gives him a miracle.
13539,His wife has been in the hospital because COVID-19 has wrecked her body so badly.
13540,"She had to relearn how to walk once she got better, and has been in a rehabilitation center for the last month."
13541,"She gets to come home on Thursday, but with her husband doing so badly ..."

13555,"Plenty of ICU capacity, high mask compliance, and low deaths."
13556,"People seem split between being perfectly fine with the lockdown, and understanding but annoyed at the restrictions."

13566,"&gt; I guess our chief epidemiologist isn't ""official"" enough for you 

Here is what he was saying when the strategy was formulated:

&gt; **It's better to let it seep through slowly**."
13567,Then you can keep control and take care of it so that it does not have to harm your society more than necessary.
13568,"...

&gt;Flock immunity could thus also be relevant in Sweden."
13569,"&gt;  
&gt;\- **We have been a bit cautious about using that word** because it breathes a little that you have given up and that is not at all what it is a question of, says Anders Tegnell."
13570,"&gt;  
&gt;\- But the basic idea is probably starting to become more and more relevant the more we see of this virus, that **this is where we need to get**."
13571,We will not have control over it in any other way.
13572,"&gt;  
&gt;WHO demands more action and believes that it is a fire that should not be allowed to burn?"
13573,"&gt;  
&gt;\- It's like with forest fires and other things, that **if you can just make it burn a little slowly and carefully, you can make it burn out**."
13574,"[https://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/a/6j7vaO/anders-tegnell-hyllar-brittisk-tanke-kring-flockimmunitet-dit-vi-beh](https://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/a/6j7vaO/anders-tegnell-hyllar-brittisk-tanke-kring-flockimmunitet-dit-vi-beh)

Tegnell admitted it was a herd immunity approach until the results of that approach became apparent."

13599,right now it seems like the current vaccines should work forever.
13600,This aged well.
13601,1861 new cases yesterday.
13602,"Has Slovakia started to trace infections, or plans to do new country wide tests, again?"
13603,As long as schools are open the virus will spread like wildfire.

13614,If your goal is complete suppression of the virus down to virtually zero cases then you need to worry about all modes of transmission no matter how rare or unlikely.
13615,If you get millions of items of frozen food a week then one contaminated with enough virus that it goes on to infect a worker is important.
13616,In most of the west there is so much person to person airborne/droplet transmission that a couple of people a month catching the virus from a packet of fish fingers is not going to move the needle.

13636,I have no idea how small businesses work with unemployment.
13637,"I guess there were small business loans too, but there were big businesses that gobbled a lot of them up by claiming each physical location was its own small business."
13638,And I know in my state (Georgia) there were people who applied and were ultimately approved but it took weeks or months to straighten out.

13653,A holiday perhaps....
13654,Not what I meant: how many deaths are acceptable to you if it means NOT LOCKING DOWN?
13655,"Saying ""zero"" is fantasy land."
13656,You still have yet to provide yours.
13657,Applying stats about testing from May in NYC is not meaningful for understanding testing numbers now across the country.
13658,An ifr of 0.23% is nonsense.
13659,That's roughly the percentage of the NYC population that was already dead at the time of the antibody testing that you just cited.
13660,The numbers you are using are self-contradictory.
13661,Nice try George Soros.
13662,The virus exposed flaws in the people not the system.. if everyone complied then we would be saying how the system succeeded

13669,"The problem is ""basic expenses"" changes depending on the person."
13670,"If you take a train or transit 1 hour out or 1 and a half hours out, that changes the cost of living dramatically."
13671,For some people a 1.5 hour commute is acceptable especially for a gigantic house for others only a 20 minute commute is acceptable.
13672,"Another problem is a lot of people think 2-3 vacations a year is a ""basic cost of living"" and for others it's a nightmare."
13673,For some people you absolutely need a car for other people you don't.
13674,"And then there's the question of lifestyle choices, like having kids."
13675,I really don't mind someone with kids making more money than me for the same work mostly because I hope the same courtesy is extended to me one day if I choose to have.
13676,But if someone never chooses to have kids.
13677,They shouldn't be disadvantaged.
13678,Many subjective factors like this.
13679,"You could use an objective metric like CPI, but that doesn't count housing."
13680,The fighters for $15 minimum wage aren't stupid.
13681,They know it's not enough money especially since it's $15 in Canada and the USA and other countries.
13682,They just want a clear consistent message that pushes for political change.
13683,At the very least you have to match inflation.
13684,Then you can get the idea in everybody's head that minimum wage should match inflation at a minimum and the rest you can have elections or debates over.
13685,What's true is a) the system shouldn't be rigged for the people at the top that is the people at the bottom shouldn't see their real wages decrease each year and b) you want to give them a fighting chance.
13686,When/if building a house takes almost no man hours.
13687,That's when we'll see real change.
13688,"We can have robots build houses in the middle of nowhere, even bungalows at cut rates."
13689,Also.
13690,Since 50% of people don't own stocks they will never get ups (and downs) of capital.
13691,"Maybe the government has to take away a few percent of everyone's pay and put it into an indexed fund, because it seems people aren't given the financial education to know how to do this."
13692,"The poorer you are the more you need to do it and they literally cannot wait to buy a house, get an emergency fund, pay off debts etc., before investing."
13693,They need to be in the market right away with every spare dollar they aren't touching for 5+ years because that's the only way they will be lifted with the rising tide.
13694,You are implicitly saying dude isn't trying hard enough.
13695,That feels like a personal attack to him because he is already trying as hard as he can to make his situation better.
13696,"For a lot of people, what you said sounds like ""look, just don't be poor and you'll have more money""."
13697,"To try to explain what he's objecting to, the concept of frugality applies mainly to disposable income and non-fixed costs."
13698,Being frugal means choosing not to get Starbucks or a luxury car and choosing to buy a smaller house.
13699,"If you're already at a point where fixed expenses (healthcare, utilities, student loans, rent on a tiny apartment) are taking up 100% of your income, you can't frugal your way out of that."
13700,Costs have risen while wages have not.
13701,Each year younger than you has a meaningfully harder time affording the basics than you do.
13702,Each year younger than you is going to to be less and less able to apply the concept of frugality to their finances and actually get ahead.
13703,"I'm only 40 and the shit sandwich that people 25 are eating right now makes me heartbroken for them because, as bad as I had it dealing with the 2007-2008 meltdown early in my career, they have it worse now."
13704,Meh.

13707,I certainly did not intend to sound judgey or holier than thou but I must have hit a sore point.
13708,They dealt with it the way they did.
13709,It worked.
13710,Right now life is back to normal in Wuhan - how are things where you live?
13711,Funny you ignored all the other countries on that list and just ran to China......
13712,Is it tho.....
13713,The question we should ask is how much misinformation the East (China/Russia) has spread.
13714,"Maybe, but if I had dual citizenship, I would have gotten the hell out of Dodge months ago."
13715,They're cautious.
13716,My mom got it at work from a new trainee who was sat right next to her.
13717,Thx for the links this is really interesting.
13718,I don't know why this is to be honest.
13719,I can only assume Denmark is testing also asimptomatic persons as well while Germany as most other countries tests only simptomatic cases.
13720,"There are a few places here to go test for free if you have no simptoms (but had a contact to an infected) and in summer you could get tested on arrival in the airports or railway station, but I am not sure if this is still possible , thus maybe there are more cases in Germany then reported."
13721,One other possibility is that Denmark reports deaths with more delay ?
13722,Usually the fatality numbers trail the number of cases by a few weeks.
13723,Okay so still... nothing.
13724,As someone that has an autoimmune disorder I’m pretty disgusted with ownership.
13725,"I feel like I have little action that I can take without jeopardizing my job, just because of how ownership doesn’t take it seriously."
13726,Contacting the health department maybe?
13727,Vaccines are supposed to start being administered in mid Dec. that should help slow spread some to the most vulnerable
13728,"Well there are people like me who are pessimistic and think that all bad things possible could and may happen, and anything good probably won’t."
13729,I call it just being realistic.
13730,"I tend to agree, we've heard of isolated reinfections but not mass reinfections."
13731,Zero.
13732,And that includes deaths as a consequence of the social disruption as an attempt to slow the spread.
13733,How many of those deaths are you ok with?
13734,And how many years like this do you’d feel it would take to equal the impact of the Spanish flu?

13745,They have it a lot easier now.
13746,"In other news, ICU beds in germany are almost full."
13747,"But you know, they ""did it the right way"", or whatever the fuck."
13748,"I've been to China myself, what do you expect them to do go in and smell that the coronavirus is there?"
13749,"I was in Xinjiang and you'd pass by cities that we're ""closed today due to bad smog"" wink wink nudge nudge."
13750,Unless you're some kind of investigative journalist there's not much more to write home about than general suspicions.

13753,Most idiotic state in the most idiotic country.
13754,Covid will be in the US for years to come
13755,Don’t you remember what happened last time China had community spread?
13756,"Given China’s density and poor public health infrastructure, they do not have the ability to hide community spread."
13757,"1.2K a month / 2 weeks / week, all time frames we could afford, plus a proper federal plan would have saved so many people and their lives."
13758,But that wasn't the goal of our Prez.
13759,"I mean, it's not all unicorn farts in Europe either."
13760,"The UK did just elect Boris Johnson, who is basically Trump but a charming buffoon instead of an infuriating one (but still a racist buffoon)."

13762,"If we could switch to a different voting style like Instant Runoff (which I think would be easier to understand for people - rank the candidates from best to worst, with unranked candidates being ""I don't want this person at all) we might do better, but nobody in power wants that."

13767,They were at the bar/restaurants often.
13768,"Life continued, like now; there was money enough."
13769,"What is necessary to manifest this personality type in the minds of those concerned, so the startle effect is gone, and the issues involved in public policy can be set up to review, analyze, and from which to draw conclusions?"

13792,But it’s “difficult for them to work” with the kids home all day so they send them to the local daycare to sit in front of their laptops there with masks on.
13793,It’s so much worse for the kids every day and so much more dangerous for a lot of people because they can’t be bothered to actually be parents.
13794,This might also play into it: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalcy_bias
13795,All signs point to lauderdale...for being an epicenter
13796,"Interesting, I wasn't aware of having posted a picture of myself on reddit."
13797,Exactly.
13798,Sacrifice one single day to enjoy many many many days with loved ones.
13799,Not a tough choice for the average educated citizen.
13800,"We’re about to find out how many uneducated below average citizens there are, sadly."
13801,It’s inevitable...
13802,"I can picture in history books (digital) 50 years from now an entire section about Thanksgiving 2021 being the largest super-spreading event in the US that rolls right into Christmas, which the results begins to show in mid-Jan and roaring through February as the cold grips most of the US."
13803,We are setting up for the perfect storm of perfect storms.
13804,"Too many think a vaccine approval makes this game over and many are saying “the cure is coming, what does it matter?” 

This pandemic has taught me that the level of uneducated citizens, regardless of income/race/background/education levels etc."
13805,is staggering.
13806,"I’m fully aware it’s all about mental capacity issues, but it’s still shocking to me the sheer number of people still on the other side of the fence, completely ignoring proven science."
13807,Enjoy your turkey legs.
13808,[removed]
13809,[removed]
13810,That'll be good.
13811,They will get to spend many more future Thanksgiving together with their loved ones.
13812,"They did well *in spite* of capitalism, not because of it."
13813,Plus they also have socialized medicine so you’re not helping the “capitalism good” argument here.
13814,EU said that all the countries are getting proportional vaccines.
13815,Meaning you can't just give Germany some and none for the rest.
13816,I've heard about it but didn't really want to overload my reply to totalriches97.
13817,"I have family members that have asthma, diabetes, and are old triple combos."
13818,"At this point, I actually don't care what it will do to me anymore, I'm just worried about them."
13819,I was curious why so many people are not taking this pandemic seriously.
13820,[deleted]
13821,Fully depends on your carrier and their hubs.
13822,I know the North East had seen a major depression in traffic as has hubs like ORD and LAX.
13823,The regional carrier I work for has had numbers remain relatively stable to slowly increasing since August.
13824,TSA numbers are what you want to check over bookings for the overall health of air travel.
13825,"I do know that there is at least one regional carrier that can’t keep up with demand, but they historically have had issues keeping up with demand."
13826,Let’s hope this doesn’t age like milk
13827,It's estimated 50 million americans will travel for Thanksgiving.
13828,50 fucking million.
13829,Its crazy alot of people dont get this fact
13830,I don´t know where you are from but you clearly never tried crossing the Tasman Sea in a small boat.
13831,8 meter waves regularly and very windy.
13832,And plenty of cyclones if you approach NZ from the north.
13833,"Yeah, USA hasn't had anything close to technocratic leadership since... Shit... the 1920's back when they were an actual thing in America?"
13834,"[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technocracy\_movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technocracy_movement)  


Apparently I am not far off."
13835,I looked that up to check.
13836,It gained strength later on in the 30's and 40's.
13837,"But as far as namesake technocracy goes, they haven't really been a thing for a long time."
13838,"NOW, as for the authoritarian digital state being encroached upon us all via Silicon valley..."
13839,It'll matter when you break a leg and can't get hospital treatment because it's full of the people who didn't give a fuck.
13840,That's exactly my point.
13841,People getting the help they need during a lockdown will make them more amicable.
13842,And if we did this in February we would be in a much better place right now.
13843,My point isn't that people simply must fly around the country next week and cough in each other's mouths because they're poor.
13844,"It's that people are tired of all this shit, they've gotten no help, and they don't contextualize everything like we do on reddit."
13845,"They want to see their families, they want to feel normal and just be done with this shit."
13846,I wish they wouldn't.
13847,But I understand why.
13848,As this shit goes on and it get worse we don't need to turn on each other.
13849,We already do that in politics enough.
13850,We blame the people who didn't vote right or who don't think right or who don't live in the right places or have the right brain power.
13851,"What I'm trying to get at with these early morning tirades is that the root cause isn't your neighbor, it's that the leaders of this country and the system it runs on are unwilling to intervene in a way that gives people the expectations for help in the future."
13852,"If they just hand out money right now to people sitting at home, people will wonder why we don't do that when there's not a pandemic."
13853,And that's bad.
13854,Because that means changing the system to operate that way and that means some people aren't going to see a 0.5% increase on their stock portfolio next quarter.
13855,They're willing to let people die and get sick to maintain the idea that the federal government can't and shouldn't intervene.
13856,"Despite us getting a new government next year, I feel that's going to remain the case."
13857,"I just hope when it happens, we all turn our anger to the people at the top rather than each other."
13858,Yup.

13871,Bringing a deadly disease to people with little to no immunity is a very authentic Thanksgiving reenactment.
13872,[removed]
13873,If very few people are dying or being hospitalised because they've been vaccinated then that's not very important.
13874,There's no intention to eliminate sars-cov-2.
13875,That would not be possible.
13876,It's going to become another seasonal virus with a milder course as the population develops pre-existing immunity through vaccination or infection.
13877,The important thing is to vaccinate the vulnerable and other adults at risk of complications.
13878,The other seasonal coronaviruses that cause the common cold likely began as coronavirus pandemics too at one point.

13883,"in Germany for example 100% of the people are wearing masks in public spaces, even during work."
13884,I would also argue that Australia is part of the west.
13885,The point about the vaccines may not have been the best.
13886,But the fact is that there was a lot of low quality clinical research coming from Asia in the beginning of the Pandemic.
13887,Research conducted by western pharma and academic medical centers is what ultimately led to reductions of over 50% in terms of hospital days and mortality.

13908,That’s such an ignorant statement I don’t even know where to start.
13909,In my country (poland) we won't be able to travel from town to town during Christmas.
13910,It will be hard to not be able to see your family in person but at least we've got zoom
13911,Mostly school children.

13927,Should be noted this to fly out mid-December for Christmas time.
13928,Yet somehow the population didn't poltiticse the virus or claim it was a hoax and they got through it relatively unscathed.
13929,Thats awesome and I can't wait to feel relieved that its getting better ☺ have a celebration beer for me!
13930,Over 70m of them voted for trump despite the pandemic.
13931,But you're just sort of brushing away actually concrete facts as to WHY they are doing better.
13932,Why did Cambodia do better than Finland?
13933,"If all you have is ""they knew what to do, they had been through it before"" and you don't actually list any real measures they took then you're just guessing."
13934,"Subsaharan Africa did MUCH better than Europe, and even better than much of Asia."
13935,Why is that?
13936,"Sure they're young, but even taking that into account they are doing much better."
13937,"There is evidence that there may also be a genetic factor in this

And Japan for example had pretty high rates of infection when they did a T cell study."
13938,Just no deaths.
13939,"The studies in Japan so far seem to suggest that coronavirus has actually spread quite rapidly there, but the effect was nothing like in Italy for example."
13940,Imo its better than name calling or making remarks about people's intelligence.
13941,Im going to try and be positive and recruit people by implying they have good qualities.
13942,Australian from Melbourne here.
13943,Just came out of lockdown with restrictions slowly lifting.
13944,Was not too bad but it went for about 100 days.
13945,Now recording our 23 contiguous day with ZERO cases.
13946,"Sorry, I had to boast."
13947,Good luck mate!
13948,Don’t listen to these people man lol.
13949,Enjoy time with your family.
13950,"Nah, but there´s such a big spectrum of different opinions and values in both East and West that the conclusion doesn´t make much sense."
13951,Both have individualist and collectivist countries.
13952,The profits for the healthcare industries are going to be huge though...
13953,Can't yank if you're soft?
13954,Rookie.
13955,South Korea is authoritarian now I guess?
13956,Taiwan too?
13957,According to my uncle its something to do with being controlled by the evil shadow government that created the totally fake virus just to keep the current potus and plucky St Nigel of Farage from saving us all.
13958,Or something.
13959,"Also the vaccine is made from mind controlling nanotech and dead babies that will change your DNA, and the masks will actually cause COVID (that's not real) so you have to get the fake vaccine."
13960,He looks sane.
13961,Don't be fooled.
13962,Absolutely horrible.
13963,I'm sorry you had to deal with that.
13964,He should be arrested for putting you in danger.
13965,Didn't they try that in October with only little effect?
13966,I think your fellow countrymen and women need to explain themselves.
13967,You're doing the right thing.
13968,I dont have great luck and I dont want to tempt fate.
13969,I do what I can so that my children aren't one of the small percentage of deaths.
13970,If something happened to them and I hadn't done all thst I could then I would die of a broken heart.
13971,"Well Sweden can't legally lockdown, so the economic impact was never a factor in why Sweden didn't."
13972,The rest I agree with.
13973,"But I do think that the actual economic impact (for all countries) will not be seen in the near future, it will take years before we have the entire picture."
13974,I mean at least they are getting tested.
13975,That’s a hell of a lot more than most people getting together for thanksgiving are doing.
13976,The only thing stopping that number is what the upper limits of testing are.
13977,Can that number of people conceivably be tested in a single day?
13978,[removed]
13979,Churches have been secretly gathering all along.
13980,"We don’t need to vaccinate the children to protect them, we need to vaccinate children to raise overall immunity levels."
13981,We know at best 50 percent of people get flu shots.
13982,It will probably be below 40 percent in the US given the damage by leadership.
13983,"The goal should be to make the vaccine mandatory for all students, including college students, by the fall of 2021."
13984,Put this virus to bed
13985,"This is the one I want , I wonder if you can specifically request a brand"
13986,"Upcoming vaccines are not approved safe for kids, who are super-spreaders."
13987,November rain 😷
13988,I agree.
13989,It could have been over by now but we've gone and made it worse
13990,You're absolutely right but we could have fixed it by toughing it out in the beginning for a month max with continued travel restrictions and mask wearing afterward.
13991,I refuse to believe people would have been incapable of staying home for a month with the help of a stimulus check and netflix.
13992,But now too much time has passed and nobody cares anymore.
13993,It's a general decadence of the West thing.
13994,"Which includes (apart from lack of memory) hubris, ignorance and dogmatism."
13995,And I say that as a European.
13996,"Hubris: while China was totally locking down a city of population 11 million, and my country was seeing low but increasing cases, the official version was that it was not a big problem, we wouldn't get many cases, it wouldn't spread here, it wasn't that bad, no measures were needed."
13997,This is pure hubris.
13998,"There was no way to believe that unless you believed that the Chinese are (1) some kind of third-world savages that need to do lockdowns to stop a simple virus that our wonderful Western healthcare would stomp like a fly, or (2) morons that make a mountain out of a molehill."
13999,And that position was very similar throughout Europe.
14000,"Ignorance: no one in positions of power in the West (and to be honest, few people outside positions of power) seems to understand what an exponential is."
14001,"When you see a straight upwards trend in a logarithmic plot, even if absolute values are still low, it means that you're screwed if you do nothing."
14002,"It's not rocket science if you know some mathematics, really."
14003,"And yet, a couple of weeks before hospitals were overrun in March-April, everyone was saying no problem, because ICUs are at 40% or whatever number, and then everyone was saying ""wow, it suddenly exploded, no one could have known!"""
14004,"- when the trend didn't change at all: it was just the normal behavior of an exponential - growth accelerates more and more so at some point in time, you cannot keep up with it."
14005,"Then in the summer, the same thing: no one seemed to notice the lines in logarithmic scale graphs regularly trending up in most European countries, then in October/November things begin to get hairy, and people (including politicians) say ""wow, the situation changed suddenly and unexpectedly, it seemed that everything was under control but we are getting a new wave, we need measures now!"""
14006,- when again it's just normal exponential behavior.
14007,Dogmatism: political thought in the West has been engulfed by utopian capitalist thinking to an extent that we are behaving like fanatics.
14008,"It seems like it takes thousands of deaths to even think about closing bars for a few weeks, because hey, individual freedom and the economy and why should the government close anything."
14009,"We criticized Communist utopian thinking, and of course for good reasons, but honestly how is this kind of thinking much better?"
14010,When did opening totally non-essential leisure business become more important than significant loss of human lives?
14011,"Why do we have a system where apparently, if we stop productivity (in non-essential sectors) for a few months, we are totally screwed and face a horrible recession?"
14012,Is that a sensible system?
14013,What would we say about a person's economic situation if it's so brittle that they will be bankrupted if they need to stop working for 6 months for some reason?
14014,"Why is it normal that the theoretically richest, most powerful countries in the world are in exactly that situation (and again, I'm talking about non-essential sectors, it's normal that we still need food, etc.)?"
14015,"Intelligence is often defined as the ability to adapt for environment, is a system (Western liberal capitalism) that cannot make even basic adaptations in the face of a change of environment (closing some businesses *on time*, and not dragging feet for months and lifting restrictions too soon) an intelligent system or is it utterly dumb?"
14016,And what about our society where criticizing capitalism in any way is seen as a fringe view?
14017,As mentioned: utter decadence of the West as a whole.
14018,This is why I have been learning Chinese for about 5 years (although it's hard as hell).
14019,I fear things may get worse and I may need to migrate at some point.
14020,I hear you.
14021,She was really good when we were hit so hard in the spring.
14022,"This round, she seems much more intent on saving businesses instead of lives."
14023,Guess we’ll see what that costs 😣
14024,What an incompetent bunch of assholes.
14025,Trying to deflect blame on the people who caught the virus rather than the shitty hotel quarantine system they implemented.
14026,They didn’t learn from Victoria’s mistake and their doing their hardest to deflect blame with their grand standing “oh we’ve done an incredible job stopping this nuclear corona blast from decimating South Australia’s population”.
14027,"Well if you hadn’t fucked up hotel quarantine in the first place, we wouldn’t have had to go into lock down at all."
14028,Why are they deflecting?
14029,Because premier whatshisface wants international students to come back through SA’s quarantine hotels.
14030,Oh please we can see through your smoke and mirrors.
14031,You had a good run USA.
14032,"At this rate, Canada and Mexico will have to build walls to keep you guys in."
14033,"Yes to the geographic advantage, but Australia also got lucky."
14034,"Had the pandemic hit a month later, 10,000s of students from China (Before China started their lockdown and the virus  was running wild) would have arrived with the border still open."
14035,And the botched Ruby Princess decision could have ended a lot worse than it did.
14036,"It has nothing to do with % of Asians in the population and everything with geographic advantages, luck, and a more serious lockdown attitude than much of Europe."
14037,Haha good thinking guys.
14038,"Covid will never find us down here, we just have to be weally weally qwiet"
14039,"&gt;Wait are you telling me that masks don’t work

 I would never say that masks don't work."
14040,I said they don't seem to have stopped a second wave in Europe.
14041,"I mean SARS was first detected here in '03, and first to be eradicated, so I'm guessing fairly similar."
14042,And the main reason Vietnam has 35 deaths was because of an outbreak at a hospital.
14043,"I'm not a fan of homeschooling, but I'm sure glad that it's an option this year."
14044,"Massive riots, protests, celebrations and gatherings?"
14045,"You're all good fam

14055,Are they quarantining from the community otherwise?

14059,"Even long covid cases, they're generally happening to people above the age of 25."
14060,"Covid is undoubtedly dangerous, fortunately the vast majority of kids handle it with such ease, most of the time they won't even know they've had it."
14061,"The risk of a side effect from a vaccine is more dangerous than the risk of the virus, that should tell us everything we need to know."
14062,The trials to see whether it works effectively in children would take years
14063,"Look in my experience, it's always better to make them look like nutjobs."
14064,"Unless the idea should never ever make it to the public, they should never be made to disappear."
14065,"Also, if they disappear it gives them some sort of legitimacy."
14066,Instead add even nuttier ideas and associate these fake nuttier ideas with the original ideas.
14067,Then nobody takes them seriously.
14068,"No ones saying you can never keep the virus out, but there will be contact tracing to squash the outbreak ASAP."
14069,There’s currently about 5000 people in 14 day quarantine due to an outbreak with a cluster of about 25.
14070,"With hundred of thousands of cases now, not many other countries can keep up with contact tracing to the level required, it is too far gone for them."
14071,This.
14072,Even a basic job would support a decent family life.
14073,"Nowadays, even two incomes can push you into the precariat."
14074,How is that better?
14075,You seem to have a cartoonish idea of what the military actually does.
14076,The majority of it is actually logistical.
14077,"Sure they’re not ringing doorbells, but they are moving way more shit around the country everyday than you seem to realize."
14078,It’s not called an industrial complex for nothing.
14079,"What happens when money, billionaires, hedge funds and corporate empires run the show and drive decision making."
14080,Our politicians know too well where the butter comes from.
14081,"&gt;it will be the best fire season in the next 20 years

How very optimistic."
14082,"&gt; There were no positive tests amongst 1,174 close contacts of asymptomatic cases."
14083,Thats encouraging!
14084,"&gt;it is their freedom, as long as it does not affect me

This is remarkably short-sighted."
14085,"The more people who get infected, the greater the chance that *you* get it."
14086,That's just epidemiology 101.
14087,"As for Amazon and DoorDash, as more people are infected, these services suffer as personnel are overworked or become infected as well."
14088,Much worse is when this happens to medical staff.
14089,"When hospitals are overwhelmed, more people die because they can't get needed medical attention."
14090,Do you not see that?
14091,Dunno which is worse.
14092,"What's happening in the US, or what the Chinese governement doesn't tell"
14093,Yeah you're right.
14094,New Zealand has the greatest government in the world and supplant them in to any given European country and it would be COVID free
14095,"""Where two or three are gathered, God will be there."""

14101,"Historically, Christians have been called to lives of ministry to communities."
14102,"They've served leper colonies, but, in doing so, they elect to cut themselves off from the rest of the world."
14103,"This secret worship is not right, especially since we can livestream the Mass service."
14104,You just need your extraordinary ministers to make housecalls to deliver the Sacrament of Communion.
14105,Do you think that will stop aunt Margaret with her yapping pooch.
14106,"For a problem on this scale, the only thing that will save you is a lock down."
14107,Masks will do fuck all.
14108,Best way to spread Covid across the country
14109,This country is full of idiots.
14110,Link dont work
14111,"I live thousands of miles away from my family and having to accept that I won't see them for Thanksgiving and likely Christmas as well was really hard for me, but you do what you have to do."
14112,I'd rather they be alive to see them in the spring or summer then take my chances and travel this time of year.
14113,[removed]
14114,Meanwhile I'm mid 20s and healthy and it put my ass in the hospital for 6 days after I already had it for 12.
14115,I dont need the MSM to tell me that its dangerous as I sit at home on oxygen while I recover.
14116,You can do it!
14117,"Just say no man, pretend it’s drugs and you’re in D.A.R.E again

Seriously tho good luck family guilt is real"
14118,The chaotic side of me sees this as a logical precursor for FL being underwater.
14119,Property loss won’t hurt as much with a smaller population.
14120,The side of me with a heart sees this as a tragic waste of human life and potential.
14121,This same thing happened in historic massive plagues - people saw the end as inevitable and wanted to go out partying.
14122,Crazy that we just shrug off the “treatment for rich people” as normal.
14123,I did the same in my head.
14124,"I've been social distancing, mask wearing, and WFH all year."
14125,"I have a really really small family no out of state travel involved, just thought it was interesting!!"
14126,lol
14127,"According to https://journalotohns.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40463-020-00423-8 loss of smell and taste for longer than 4 weeks is rare, most people have at least partial recovery before then."
14128,We know how to distribute vaccines and they are churning out doses.
14129,I think it’s going to be a success.
14130,What about the millions that have had it?
14131,Why can’t they go out?
14132,My parents are asking me about coming over.
14133,They have said how careful they are.
14134,Lots of people are saying they are careful.
14135,what's careful is staying home.
14136,"I don't know what the fuck Zenz is but I've been to Xinjiang, I've seen the closed cities."
14137,Incredibly irresponsible.
14138,"I do look forward to going to parties like that next year, post vaccine, but absolutely not right now."
14139,Exactly.
14140,Lock the doors for two weeks and if nobody is infected then you're all free to leave.
14141,Infection breaks out?
14142,Looks like you're all going to get it and deal with it in that bar.
14143,Good luck!
14144,And it's nonsensical hyperbole.
14145,They might as well just have said nothing so yeah down they go and rightfully so
14146,"Or, maybe at some point if the risk is low enough, we accept that risk in order to see our loved ones and maintain our mental health."
14147,Your absolutism is unhelpful and unrealistic.
14148,We're never going to completely stop the spread until there's a vaccine.
14149,We can only hope to decrease it significantly by taking sensible measures.
14150,"I would say that if they avoid gatherings for a few days and then test negative, that's a sensible and realistic way to mitigate the risk."
14151,He said his dad needs to be with people.
14152,I think we should respect his decision to care for his family while also taking precautionary measures.

14154,It's the Gdamn truth .
14155,my city has insane case and death rates and 90% icu capacity.
14156,their solution close bars at 11 hahaha what a bunch of idiots
14157,"Even the people I know who have known someone to die shrug it off because it was ""their time"" or they had pre-existing conditions."
14158,They just don't care.
14159,Who gives a shit?
14160,Let them get sick and die.
14161,At that point there’s no one to blame but themselves.
14162,"My pregnant friend told us that she was turning off the text notifications on our group chat, because we were talking about COVID."
14163,Like she’s literally covering her ears and saying “La la la la la” instead of being informed.
14164,Greetings from the future.
14165,Deaths are at 2k again.
14166,"Cases are at 200k, so we might surpass the March death rate."
14167,I agree with you completely about it advancing medicine and allowing better outcomes for all.
14168,Especially knowing that the trial my kid is going through so far has had no negative side affects at any stage in the trial.
14169,Which is pretty rare.
14170,"That being said, it's still a new drug, no long term affects have been studied and it's still my baby that I don't want anything bad to happen to."
14171,It's no a light decision at all.
14172,"It took me months talking to specialists, other parents, and different doctors within the trial to make the decision."
14173,"It's one thing to know a medicinal clinical trial is relatively safe for your child, it's another to actually enroll them into a trial."
14174,Thanks for your well wishes.
14175,I am very hopeful for this trial as well.
14176,I wish you well during this time too
14177,I desperately want out of this imbecile-infested hell-hole of a country.
14178,Perfect time for my life to fall apart and all of my family relations crumble.
14179,"No holiday travelling, no people!"
14180,Not sure why you ever would have.
14181,A reasonable timeline was always 2-3 years with the best case scenario of a decent vaccine after a year.
14182,First year is messed up.
14183,Second year is people getting vaccinated - you still have to mask up and keep socially distant until you hit around 70% vaccinated.
14184,"Third year is recovery, which also sucks because a lot of businesses have closed, unemployment is high, etc."
14185,There was never a scenario in which 5-6 months would see a return to normality.
14186,"Spend Christmas with your family, then spend New Years with your friends."
14187,Then go back to the office on January 1.
14188,That way *everybody* gets infected!
14189,It's so depressing that we've gotten to this point as a country.
14190,"I don't like having to choose between the lesser of two evils, but this year I didn't even think twice about it."
14191,No contest.
14192,Trump really is that terrible.
14193,I looked it up.
14194,250 reinfections.
14195,"Out of 55,000,000."
14196,Spooky and totally not just the product of a few people with weak immune systems.
14197,The US is already at 1-2k deaths and 200k positives daily.
14198,I wonder where this will stand a few weeks after Thanksgiving.
14199,They’re really making it an ‘us and them’ situation
14200,And how will you keep the dry ice from immediately sublimating?
14201,That type of insulated container that can keep dry ice from sublimating isn’t cheap.
14202,The reply button?
14203,Don't bother showing me links.
14204,I've watched him LIVE say it MULTIPLE TIMES.
14205,Wait so florida only has 4k cases?
14206,Maybe I'm not reading the info correctly.
14207,Oh wait  per 100k people .
14208,And a population of 21 million.
14209,Edit: added second half.
14210,&gt; So if people arent allowed to congregate.
14211,Whats the point of masks?
14212,The point is that people still congregate: https://youtu.be/isGGeYHGl-M
14213,"&gt;I don’t want to lock down

Yet

&gt; I stay inside 

So you do want to lock down."
14214,"Indeed, I’ll be able to rest easy knowing that it’s the beginning of the end"

14216,"It fucking sucks, I’m staying out for thanksgiving at my college but I have to go home for winter break."
14217,I don’t have anywhere to go on this entire side of the country so I have to fly home in December.
14218,"If flights were dead I would be okay, but it seems everyday from now till January will be truly busy travel days."
14219,"I’ve been able to get much more serious PPE for the trip, but there’s still so much risk."
14220,"If you don’t have to fly, please do not."
14221,That's far from certain.
14222,Look at South Australia - outbreak that was quickly cleaned up.
14223,"Or at NZ, multiple outbreaks, which were rapidly eliminated by contact tracing."
14224,They should hire more people.
14225,They should bring in every possible expert to read this as quickly as possible.
14226,"For months, they knew they'd need to do this, so why didn't they prepare to get this done in just a few days?"
14227,Is there no possible way to do this faster?
14228,[removed]
14229,Yeah but the virus can spread effectively with or without masks.
14230,"No of course not , I still go hang out with my friends and I enjoy going to twin peaks ."
14231,"There’s one opening near me in February 😁😎

Although honestly it’s usually just one or two other friends at the table not 10 and the waitress is wearing a mask anyways ."
14232,It's not possible to contact trace without rumors flying.
14233,These two new cases had rumors flying all over chinese web even before government announcement.
14234,"I hope so, but that certainly isn’t being reflected anywhere else in the country."
14235,(Except maybe PEI?)
14236,"lock them up , heavy fines$$$$$!"
14237,!
14238,"Tie an onion on your belt, and you will get all the social distancing you need."
14239,Nothing we’ve done here has gone well as far as planning though.

14243,"?”

Where did he ever say he wasn’t being careful?"
14244,Some of you guys would really benefit from learning basic reading comprehension.
14245,You’re not getting it.
14246,"There is no “choice” to work or not, when not working means you starve and lose your home."
14247,"In this case, the gov."
14248,made a choice for uncontrolled spread when they decided not to pay people to stay home.
14249,Yea I'm used to it.
14250,"""It's frightening."
14251,"It's insane."""
14252,should be the new Florida state motto.
14253,"Just to reply to this, unless you’re only talking abut the CRJ-200, there is recirc fans, this system is HEPA filtered however."
14254,"That said, the majority of the air is coming from the bleed air system, which is from the compressor attached to the engine."
14255,And this air also goes out the outflow valve.
14256,It doesn’t recirc forever like some people seem to think.
14257,"Seriously though, I'm sure he had hopes of cashing in somehow."
14258,"Certainly politically, maybe financially."
14259,"Ignoring the enormous proximity issues with this idea, specialization is required to run a complex economy."
14260,"You can't be a surgeon for a week to earn your triple bypass, or a civil engineer or mechanic or hairdresser or lawyer or truck driver or accountant or teacher or butcher or electrician or veterinarian or a million other jobs that require education and skill to master."
14261,[removed]
14262,Why would they do that?
14263,The reason they aren't recommended is due to FHM being doubtful regarding their efficiency.
14264,Can't exactly try and rewrite history when it's so well documented.
14265,[removed]
14266,The violent individual is to blame but society-at-large shares part of the blame for forcing the victim into a dangerous situation in the first place.
14267,"For instance, if a city built a busy, high-speed road in front of school it would not be right to say fault only lies with the driver when a child is run over."
14268,Society-at-large would also be at blame to for creating a dangerous situation in the first place.
14269,Thursday and Friday British Columbia had cases in the 500's.
14270,Hopefully we're on a downward trend.
14271,"Yes, did I say otherwise?"
14272,So explain to me why I should trust the same government who used a [vaccine program](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2015/02/150227-polio-pakistan-vaccination-taliban-osama-bin-laden/) to harvest DNA data from children in order to match it to their criminal parents and then [DEFENDED that heinous action](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cia-defends-running-vaccine-program-to-find-bin-laden/2011/07/13/gIQAbLcFDI_story.html) and said it was perfectly fine?
14273,"Why should they be the ones now vaccinating Americans, how can we trust them not to do the same thing here?"
14274,Great news tbh.
14275,I think millions will cancel in the next few days.
14276,But not enough
14277,It absolutely will.
14278,"For example, when this started in March, 7 of the 24 beds in my ICU were turned into covid beds."
14279,"At the beginning of this month, they added 7 more."
14280,We only have 2 more we can add because the remaining 8 we need to keep for clean patients (used to be a cardiac surgery unit).
14281,They’ve offered double time to any one willing to work overtime shifts until 12/31 and we’re all working 4-5 12 hour shifts a week.
14282,It is absolutely insane.
14283,We are a small hospital (199 beds) and we are running at like 85-90% capacity which never happens.
14284,I’m scared.
14285,"You sound very smart, I'm sure your opinion is great."
14286,"Looks like Florida will forever be an animal reservoir, a perfect host for all the new coronavirus permutations"
14287,Chill bro it’s not that deadly
14288,That's nothing to be scared about
14289,My judge had it spot on with that idocracy movie
14290,Good but they don’t even know how long immunity lasts for
14291,It has nothing to with being afraid.
14292,It’s stupidly at its best.
14293,It’s called being a decent human being and doing your part by not participating in shit like this and wearing a mask.
14294,They want to keep taking the blue bill and go back into the matrix.
14295,Ignorance is bliss to them.
14296,good thing i can blame both the cowboys organization AND the fans who choose to attend
14297,If you live here and have data already why pose the question?
14298,Florida is third in highest number of cases.
14299,We were on a downward trend but are spiking pretty dramatically right now and that will only get worse through the end of the year.
14300,And going by cases per 100k we are still in the upper half of most cases
14301,That was on the first soforthilfe.
14302,The second one for November is not based on expenses.
14303,I don't mean this in a rude way at all but there is remote (Zoom etc) therapy available if you would like someone to talk to.
14304,"I get that just boredom can lead to more consumption but as someone with major alcoholism running through his family, it may be worth reaching out just to see if that process works for you."
14305,BUT JESUS
14306,[removed]
14307,Come back in Dec and say that.
14308,10% positivity rate.
14309,Desantis is doing his best to cook the numbers.
14310,Death rate stilla about 1/2 of all time high in florida.
14311,No mitigation efforts.
14312,Florida was late for their first spike and will be late for the second as well.
14313,I really hope so.
14314,The anti-vax movement is going to be insane.
14315,This.
14316,"I know someone that had a 100+ fever and lost their taste of smell and said, “I might not have it.”"
14317,We got a Shipt subscription as a present for our new baby.
14318,Even though we're right across the street from the grocery store it's nice having to not even step foot in the there most of the time.
14319,What a sweeping generalization of two sides of the planet
14320,I’m not reading this bc anyone who puts this much effort into Reddit can’t have a relevant opinion
14321,Antivaxxers will be rampant.
14322,"yeah, there's always gonna be at least one person still wearing a mask several years from now."
14323,"is what it is, comes down to an individual ethical/moral judgment"
14324,[removed]
14325,We got 3% less VAT until December and also people with kids got some extra cash.
14326,Like corsets
14327,Hell on this site people are shamed for even having a desire to do those things.
14328,Sounds like you’re just scared .
14329,If you don’t have a compromised immune system and you’re not over 80 then GO get out of the house and see your friends and family !
14330,Do you realize how many people have already caught this and are completely fine ?
14331,Humans constantly act against their own self interest at the best of times.
14332,"Hell, people petitioned against seatbelts, vaccines, and fluoride."
14333,History is a great judge and it blows my mind that they didn’t maybe think this through more.
14334,The fact they thought “personal responsibility” would be enough over selfishness is just insanely naïve to me.
14335,"I’m not trying to be edgy or pessimistic or whatever, but people certainly aren’t like that anymore...or just never were."
14336,&gt; I wouldn't be comfortable in that situation but clearly there are many with a higher risk appetite than mine.
14337,Appetite for _other people's risk._
14338,"Well it’s too bad because I’ve been judged plenty for being cautious, so I see no reason not to return the favor."
14339,More like x^2 + x^4 + x^16 .
14340,.
14341,.

14348,Nobody cares what people on nazi twitter have to say
14349,It's not a conspiracy it's literally what the World Economic Forum is saying.
14350,There is literally a page on their website that is called The Great Reset.
14351,"How can it be a conspiracy theory when an international organization comprised primarily of wealthy and powerful individuals from around the world are saying that it's a thing, and through official, public channels like their own website."
14352,[removed]
14353,"If you really had it, you would understand the severity of it, and wouldn't be such an ignorant jackass about it."
14354,"Fuck off, people many of us care about are dying because of your foolish and selfish behavior."
14355,"&gt;And yes, COVID spread from animals to humans via eating these infected wild animals."
14356,This is a well established fact.
14357,Can you source this claim?
14358,"I've heard of zoo animals bring infected, and also mink farms."
14359,"Not eating wild animals though...

&gt;Lol did you miss the part where I said that they slaughter the animals right next to where it’s served?"
14360,"That was the important part, numb-nuts

I actually didn't want to comment on this because of how absurdly false it is..."
14361,Its fascinating.
14362,When I see these extremists on the tv or YouTube I can almost see a pattern on how they were raised and the type of parents they had.
14363,Also my guess is that they were the type of students that must memorized answers for tests and weren't able to study and comprehend things to the point where they understood it.
14364,Just recognise you have optimistic bias and adjust for that
14365,Cook your food.
14366,Individualism vs collectivism isn’t a myth
14367,Trust I’m not the only one to think this way ... good day
14368,*sorts by controversial*
14369,Of course you can compare the numbers.
14370,Base it off per capita rather than the vastly different population.
14371,"Did you really just do ""as a mother"" about vaccines?"
14372,"It is not new, for seriously the millionth time."
14373,"These vaccines have been reverse engineered from a safe, proven Sars-1 vaccine that has been programed to attack the protein spikes in covid."
14374,And you are not the first to try it.
14375,We have had multiple thousands of people taking these vaccine canadites for months now.
14376,"It is a defense mechanism to be cautious, it's baked into our nature but you are misleading people with your post."
14377,We need all hands on deck if you don't want to keep seeing mobile morgues
14378,"Right, you all know better than people making this."
14379,"I’m just a sheep and you’re way too advanced to think like a simpleton, such as myself."
14380,Hope nothing else kills you within the next 365 days.
14381,It could cost $1000 a head and every developed country's government would still be lining up for it.
14382,Whether it's $35 or $100 doesn't make a ton of difference.
14383,It's their choice and their own risk.
14384,If they get the virus they have to deal with the consequences and their family blood is on them.
14385,There's definitely a difference between going to school and sitting in front of a screen.
14386,"That said, if the child is being left somewhere where the parents are not, that is child care."
14387,Assholes.
14388,The lot of them.

14390,"Listen, I'll rub raw chicken in my eyes if I want."

14393,"Yep, the covid deniers, anti maskers and antivaxxers have the gall themselves the True Patriots to safeguard America."
14394,"Sheer selfishness and ignorance are virtues #AmericanTheFree 

I only hope the younger generations show up and do better than whatever that is."
14395,I hope and pray our people wake up from thier delusions soon...
14396,Sure.
14397,Opinions are opinions.
14398,Facts are facts.
14399,Don't confuse the two.
14400,"We can take off our masks when we’re eating in a restaurant, and this includes both indoor and outdoor dining."
14401,"The mask wearing is but one part of the solution - we gather in groups of no more than 5, with tables at least a meter apart."
14402,"And when we’re done eating, the mask goes back on."
14403,"At home, masks are not worn."
14404,"We can have up to 5 guests each time, and that’s pretty much it really."
14405,"The thing that makes it work, is the fact all these are not “recommended” - they are enforced."
14406,"Obviously they can’t be checking everyone’s homes, but like in Australia and New Zealand, if your neighbours complained, they’ll send someone over to check, pronto."
14407,"All this is not to say things are perfect - people still do shit, and some safe distancing officers abuse their power, but they are taken care of rather quickly."
14408,"One thing that is absolutely crucial for the success of ANY measure, is consistency - consistent messaging, consistent implementation, consistent enforcement."
14409,Perhaps it’s so that Singapore is small enough for this to work.
14410,"And maybe in the US and other bigger countries, there needs to be better governance, a stronger tone from the top, and more stringent checks."
14411,Am I enjoying it?
14412,Of course not.
14413,"I have family outside of the country who I have not seen since February, and our business suffered for a while back in April and May when the circuit breaker (effectively a lockdown) happened, but we hoped it would get better, and it did."
14414,"I believe no one can sustain lockdowns for a long time, and every little light coming thru from the end of the tunnel helps - the travel bubble with HK (which unfortunately is being suspended now due to the increasing number of cases there), discussion of another travel bubble with HK, certain activities (group sports, night life) starting again."
14415,(Sorry for the long answer to your question 😅)
14416,Why don’t you have a look at Asia then.
14417,Lots of Countries doing well there.
14418,Being an island isn’t why we have squashed it.

14420,"I think we both just (even though I can't really speak for Norway, because I don't know what they did) managed to reduce our cases during the spring so low with limited lockdowns that it was a bit easier to track them down after that?"
14421,"But now our cases have started to grow again, especially around the capital region - again."

14440,It's only half the actual effective doses because each person needs 2.
14441,After that essential workers are probably better than old people because stopping the spread will be more effective than targeting the most vulnerable demographics.
14442,"Stopping the spreaders will stop more people from dying faster than giving the vaccine to the most vulnerable because lethality is low, but infectiousness is high."

14452,"I mean we're only at 2,000 deaths a day and growing from COVID..."
14453,"In a normal year over the past decade, yeah we've averaged ~7,000 deaths per day from literally every other source, so what really is another 2,000+?"
14454,Another ~30% increase in deaths every single day over a single virus?
14455,Doesn't seem like a big deal.
14456,"Oh and nevermind the fact the numbers are still under-reported and we're closer to 350,000 U.S. deaths than the note 250,000 deaths."

14504,"Ah yes, a communist country."
14505,I'm sure that implementing the same policies as two communist nations in a democracy would work super smoothly.

14513,"It's just doses of a vaccine that need cooling, it's nothing special delivery and distribution wise other than the cooling and the military can't really help with that more than the commercial sector either."
14514,"Commercial sector simply has a lot more equipment and experience in delivery, vaccination, distribution and refrigeration."
14515,"The military are experts at military, that's about all."
14516,Unless your talking about the army core of engineers and they get most of their experience doing domestic work that has nothing to do with the military really.
14517,Only in those cases will the military be competitive with the commercial sector because it really does take practice and infrastructure to be good at things like that.

14564,[removed]
14565,"Yeah, but UPS can deliver packages a lot better because that's something they do all the time and the military does not."
14566,"As important as resource delivery is to the military, it's still not something they do all the time like an actual delivery service."
14567,When it comes to the logistics of delivery they are not going to outperform a commercial delivery service.
14568,"It's more or less just like any elementary school kid could figure out, practice makes perfect, the industries that do specific jobs are better at those jobs than anybody else."
14569,Delivering supplies via air drop has not useful here.
14570,"I think the reason to use the military is to SECURE the shipment and maybe allow feds a first come first service advantage, not because they will be really great at the logistics of delivery or distribution, neither are things they normally or can do more efficiently than a commercial service that does it everyday."
14571,"Or, at the very least, saving himself the blame for their deaths."

14575,"If we hadn’t totally botched and half-assed the covid response as a nation, we wouldn’t have to be dealing with potentially 2 years of this shit."
14576,The initial lockdowns were supposed to curb the spread of the disease.
14577,"Take the economic hit, reduce the viral spread then reopen the country."
14578,"We failed that, terribly."
14579,Masks were then encouraged to reduce active spread.
14580,We politicized it and failed at doing that.
14581,Then the fed govt dropped all responsibility and had the states handle it themselves.
14582,"No national mandates or anything, just a free-for-all of different guidelines and mandates that differ from state to state."
14583,"Now there’s a vaccine coming out, and from what I’ve gathered from people in my life, no one wants to fucking take it."
14584,"So instead of shortening this pandemic, this may very well stretch to 2 years as not only will the vaccine rollout take time, we have to educate the public to want to take the damn things in the first place."
14585,Soar towards?
14586,That's already been topped.
14587,"It won't be long before the weekly average is 200k a day, which is to say it might happen next week."
14588,"Well, I never said it was fully justified."
14589,"Still, when I'm evaluating how I've managed to not contract covid, I don't decide my precautions were ineffective because *other people* have it."
14590,Does that make sense?
14591,[deleted]
14592,Oh screw off you over sensitive bot.
14593,Literally nothing in what i said was incivil.
14594,Is this wholesale price?
14595,I know TDaP wholesales for like $12 but see it billed for ~$300 quite often.
14596,Vietnam has 100 million people with 3 land borders including China.
14597,The thing that would really make that difficult is the political/law side with the EU common border agreements but it could be done.
14598,The fact is that there's no consensus on if asymptomatic people can spread it or how much they can spread it.
14599,The best thing you can do is error on the side of a strict of a quarantine as possible.
14600,"staying in your room and getting delivery or something and having your roommates put it by your door is all pretty doable, but to shared bathroom is a little bit problematic."
14601,If you had more than one bathroom maybe you could like get them to use one bathroom and you would use the other and you would always wear a mask if you were outside your room.
14602,I would put a small fan in the window blowing out of your room to generate negative pressure and keep the airflow blowing outward.
14603,If you have a central HVAC system with a cold air return and a heat vent I think you should cover those up good so Eric does not circulate from your room to the rest of the house.
14604,If you're in a cooler climate you might just temporarily use an electric heater to make up the heat difference.
14605,Electric blankets are also quite efficient options since I'm recommending you turn off central heat and blow conditioned air out of the room.
14606,It's just not a good situation with all those other people in the house so you should do everything you can or live outside the house temporarily or have them live outside the house temporarily which I know are probably not easy options.
14607,"If you could like stay in a tent in the yard or maybe I have a shed or something you could temporarily quarantine to, that would be even safer for the roomies and you could pull it off for at least a few days during what we can estimate will be the peak of your infection."
14608,Betting on asymptomatic spread being minimal without a real consensus is just too much of a bet and you never know if one of your roommates might be highly susceptible regardless of their perceived health.
14609,This is great work!
14610,One thing that blows me away is just how hard New England got hit in the spring.
14611,"When you look at cumulative deaths per 100k, NY is only now about to get passed by LA and MS, after not budging much since June."
14612,NJ is still way out ahead.
14613,I can't imagine what that was like to live through.
14614,What?
14615,The first time was incompetence.
14616,The second time is due to incompetence and ignorance.
14617,Deniers are unable to understand balance.
14618,We watched the tornado barely touch down once in NY and the rest of the country is either enjoying the lovely weather on the football field or back in the locker rooms bracing themselves in a doorway preparing for the real storm.
14619,"But, *freedom*"
14620,"All things are relative isn't it, the Chinese government does it job as the people expects it to, which by itself wouldn't make it good, hell it was considered bad for a few weeks in the beginning."
14621,"But when it became clear that almost every other government on planet earth bar a few here and there did far, far worse, perceptions change."
14622,"After all, half a million dead between Europe and US isn't something civilized countries can just ignore, and some people on this planet still base reality on observation rather than doctrine."
14623,He should have known what was going to happen when he went on the Joe rogan podcast back in March and explained to Rogan saunas won't cure him from COVID.
14624,That foreshadowed the rest of the country's approach for the next 9 months.
14625,They can just walk away.
14626,Nothing chains them to their employer.
14627,"The nurses do have a ton more options, but doctors can absolutely choose to not accept additional patients, and they can opt to not come to work anymore."
14628,They have all the rights of any other worker and do not have to work in an unsafe environment.
14629,The issue isn't a lack of empathy.
14630,The issue is that Westerners are in denial that they completely fail to live up to their supposed core values - particularly individualism.
14631,Most people in the West are actually deeply conformist.
14632,That's why they refuse to wear masks and see it as an act of patriotism.
14633,It's not because they are stupid or lack empathy.
14634,It's because they are so desperate to fit in that they are willing to dumb themselves down just to conform.
14635,It's the same psychology that drove all those idiots eating Tide Pods.
14636,By contrast there is no similar pretense that you _must_ be an individual in East Asia.
14637,That's why people aren't refusing to wear masks in these countries.
14638,"There is no pressure exerted on them to assert their ""individuality"", so they feel no need to swallow dangerous chemicals just to show off."
14639,The sole exception is the Philippines - particularly its liberal middle class which laps up all the American individualism talk.
14640,And that's why this cohort is pretty much verging on the delusionally suicidal over Covid.
14641,"Most of the Philippines actually thinks we did an okay job given the circumstances, hence the president getting a 80+% approval rate."
14642,"But because agreeing with the government would make them ""conformist"", they pretty much just keep finding new things to be upset about to justify their opposition to government policy."

14648,**There is finally light at the end of the Covid tunnel.
14649,"Two promising vaccines – one developed by Turkish immigrants to Germany, the other by a US firm co-founded by a Canadian scientist and a Lebanese born investor – ought to enable Europeans to put the pandemic behind us at some point next year."
14650,"**

But for now, Europe seems set for a long, dark Covid winter, with the situation in Brussels particularly grim."
14651,"As coronavirus cases have surged again, the authorities have reimposed stringent restrictions on residents and businesses."
14652,"And with societies locked down again, the economy is going back into reverse."
14653,"This is a disaster not just for ordinary Europeans, but also for Europe’s global standing."
14654,"For sure, some places in Europe are coping with the pandemic better than others."
14655,"Economically, manufacturing powerhouses such as Sweden and Germany have experienced less severe slumps so far than tourist destinations such as Spain and Italy."
14656,"Healthwise, Helsinki has had far fewer coronavirus cases and deaths per million residents than Brussels, which rivals Madrid as the European capital worst-hit by Covid-19 so far."
14657,"Shockingly, by mid-November the total number of Covid deaths per million people in Belgium was eight times higher than in neighbouring Germany."
14658,"While some of the differences in measured death rates across countries may be due to discrepancies in how Covid deaths are counted, comparisons of the number of deaths this year in excess of the average for the previous five years confirm that the worst-affected European countries are the UK, Spain and Belgium."
14659,It may be some comfort to Europeans that even the most incompetent European governments seem like models of public-health management compared to the reckless ineptitude of the Trump administration in the US.
14660,But the bigger international picture is far less flattering.
14661,"While Europeans like to think that their societies are the epitome of global sophistication and progress, both their governments and their economies are dealing with the pandemic much worse than China and East Asia are."
14662,"Indeed, scarcely a decade after the 2008–09 financial meltdown and the ensuing crisis in the eurozone shredded Europe’s reputation for sound economic management and speeded its relative economic decline, the coronavirus pandemic is destroying its reputation for good governance and accelerating that economic decline."
14663,The catalogue of failures is long.
14664,European governments were unduly complacent about Covid at the beginning of the year.
14665,"Having failed to prevent the virus’s spread in Europe, they were then forced into economically devastating lockdowns to prevent hospitals being overwhelmed."
14666,Confinements were then eased before the virus had been fully suppressed.
14667,"Worse, over the summer months when infections were low, governments failed to develop effective mass testing and contact tracing systems that would have prevented a resurgence of cases."
14668,"Now, in the face of a second wave that again threatens to overwhelm healthcare systems, governments are imposing painful new social and economic restrictions every week."
14669,The contrast with East Asia is instructive.
14670,"While China was slow to react to the initial spread of the disease and then imposed a particularly severe lockdown, especially in Wuhan, it has since kept the virus suppressed, quickly stamping out subsequent local flare-ups."
14671,South Korea quelled an initial upsurge of cases without an economy-wide lockdown through ruthlessly effective contract tracing and selective isolation.
14672,Taiwan also avoided a lockdown; its officials were monitoring arrivals from Wuhan even before the Chinese government had admitted it had a problem.
14673,Both Korea and Taiwan have made good use of mobile-phone technology to suppress the virus.
14674,"Even Vietnam, a poor country with a long porous border with China, has managed to keep a lid on Covid."
14675,The difference in mortality figures is vast.
14676,"By mid-November Europe had recorded more than 330,000 deaths from Covid – including more than 13,000 in Germany, which is seen as a success by European standards."
14677,"In contrast, China had counted 4,634 deaths, Japan 1,903, Korea 496, Vietnam 35 and Taiwan 7."
14678,"For sure, East Asia had more recent experience of dealing with a coronavirus pandemic, having suffered from SARS in 2002–04."
14679,But there was nothing to stop European governments learning the lessons from SARS too.
14680,"And while it is perhaps excusable that they were overwhelmed by the initial exponential spread of Covid-19 in Europe in February and March, it is inexcusable that they haven’t used the time since then to develop suppression measures as effective as East Asia’s."
14681,"To paraphrase Oscar Wilde, to be forced to lock down the economy once may be regarded as a misfortune; to do so twice looks like carelessness."
14682,So much for the supposed superiority of European governance.
14683,The incompetence of European governments has not just led to painful restrictions on personal freedom along with many avoidable deaths.
14684,It is also hammering European economies.
14685,"**The pandemic will leave scars**

The gap between West and East is glaring."
14686,"While even Germany is facing the worst recession since the 1930s, China is the only major economy in the world that is likely to grow this year."
14687,Output per person has plunged in France but has scarcely fallen in South Korea.
14688,"While governments in the eurozone, the UK and the US are running up huge debts to try to cushion the blow of the Covid collapse, Taiwan’s scarcely needs to borrow at all."
14689,And that huge divide in economic performance is set to grow as the second wave sweeping through Europe this autumn and winter takes its toll.
14690,"Worse, European economies are likely to take years to make up the lost ground."
14691,"While economic activity will bounce back next year if a vaccine is forthcoming and a semblance of normal life resumes, the pandemic will inevitably leave scars – not least on young people’s education and job prospects."
14692,The structural shifts that the pandemic has accelerated – notably the increased adoption of digital technologies – will accentuate the economic disruption.
14693,"The likes of Zoom video conferencing and online shopping are a boon, but in the near term the digital transition may cost jobs as airlines shrink and physical stores shutter faster than new jobs are created."
14694,"When the pandemic finally passes, many workers will have outdated skills, either because they have languished unemployed or because governments have subsidised them to remain in jobs that are no longer viable."
14695,Many businesses will be lumbered with huge debts that may be bearable while interest rates remain very low but which prevent them investing in become more productive.
14696,"While governments with high debts may have greater latitude to continue borrowing, especially if central banks continue to snap up their bonds, they will eventually face pressure, both domestically and at EU level, to tighten their belts."
14697,The upshot is not just that Europeans face a long period of economic misery.
14698,It is that Europe’s weight in the world will plunge – again.
14699,"Consider that when the financial crisis struck in 2008, the eurozone’s economy was more than three times bigger than China’s in euro terms."
14700,"A decade later, China had overtaken it."
14701,"This year, China is set to surpass the EU as a whole."
14702,Relative economic decline has wider repercussions.
14703,The EU is a geopolitical pygmy.
14704,"It lacks a cohesive foreign policy, let alone military might."
14705,So its power to defend Europeans’ interests both within Europe and elsewhere depends largely on its economic clout.
14706,"It is because the EU has a huge single market – worth €16.4 trillion in 2019 – for which it takes collective decisions on trade, regulation and competition policy that it can stand up to President Donald Trump’s bullying on trade, develop tough rules to protect the environment and data privacy that are emulated globally, and curb the monopolistic excesses of big tech companies."
14707,"Thus, if the EU single market’s global importance diminishes, so does the EU’s scope to shape the world."
14708,"As well as eroding Europe’s economic heft, the coronavirus crisis is undermining its cultural appeal."
14709,"German cars and appliances are associated with high quality, Italian fashion with luxury, French food and wine with good taste."
14710,"More broadly, European societies seem to offer an enviable combination of freedom, security and quality of life."
14711,"But now they are also associated with an unenviable mix of shambolic governance and draconian lockdowns, of creaking public healthcare systems, individual irresponsibility and unnecessary deaths."
14712,That tarnishes the European brand internationally in all sorts of ways.
14713,"Last but not least, Europe’s failure to get to grips with the Covid pandemic casts aspersions on its political system."
14714,While liberal democracy has intrinsic appeal to many people – because it offers individuals greater freedom and citizens collectively greater power – it has also been popular because it was associated with economic success and good government.
14715,"Liberal democracy had already taken a battering from the financial crisis, which made governments seem both incompetent and corrupt."
14716,"Now, European governments can’t even manage the basics of keeping people safe."
14717,"For sure, South Korea and Taiwan, both boisterous democracies, have successfully suppressed the virus."
14718,"And yes, the pandemic has exposed the bungling of illiberal populists such as Trump."
14719,But it may also bolster the global appeal of effective authoritarian governance.
14720,Another reason why Beijing may benefit from the Covid failings of Brussels and Berlin – not to mention those of London and Washington DC.
14721,These people really don’t get it.
14722,THEY ARE MORONS.
14723,"As a teacher, thank you for doing the responsible thing."
14724,"We're still in-person, despite skyrocketing cases and test positivity of over 8%, and shit is scary."
14725,"It isn't the west, its Europe and the US that've fucked up bigtime."
14726,"Some of us have to work every day, and deal with morons like you."

14728,"There are *plenty* of people, including me, who are missing out on family gatherings because we care about each other."
14729,"But go ahead, spread it to the rest of your anti-science relatives."
14730,The rest of us who have been sacrificing really appreciate your 5th grade mentality.
14731,Closer to 2k a day now
14732,"&gt;It's important that no matter how bad this gets, instead of blaming other poor people for being stupid/irresponsible/fat/lazy/etc, we blame the people who have been in charge for decades and who refused to be stewards of the country's well-being."
14733,YES.
14734,Take all the awards!
14735,I've been saying this same thing for WEEKS NOW.
14736,Religion is used to justify some crazy shit that has nothing to do with religion.
14737,"""If America needs socialised healthcare Jesus would come down and tell us so."""
14738,"""Climate change?"
14739,"God gave us this planet to live on, how arrogant of us to think that we could control the climate and not Him."""
14740,Good border control?
14741,These trials start with adults.
14742,It takes time.
14743,Oh I expect a lot of this.
14744,The new normal crew is already trying to undermine vaccines.
14745,"Vaccinate the shit out of vulnerable people as soon as possible, I imagine."
14746,"Since restrictions are being eased gradually and not going fully back to how it was, it will take longer to grow back to levels it was at before lockdown, So they have maybe 3 months."
14747,"If they vaccinate a significant portion of the vulnerable by then, then less severe restrictions might be needed."
14748,Yes...
14749,"Thanksgiving and Christmas coming up, US is truly fucked."
14750,My state Department of Health webinar had the same prioritized order.
14751,"Are you mocking me for forgetting to put a question Mark

14753,I’m really happy for you!
14754,That’s awesome!
14755,I’m still in person and it’s really scary.
14756,I hope we go remote soon.
14757,:( This pandemic soured me on teaching.
14758,I wonder if a 9/11 every day will wake people up.
14759,Unfortunately I doubt it.

14769,"Everytime something is going your way, you think, ""I don't know about this."
14770,"Lets see how this turns out."""
14771,Because you can't accept good things can happen to you.
14772,"If one of those people is an asymptomatic, it turns into 7 people that are now spreading."
14773,"I’m surprised by all the stubborn “muh freedum” people, and I’m also not."
14774,People are fucking idiots.
14775,These are the same people who splash water on their hands and consider them “washed”
14776,Sooooo.... the US is really a 3rd world country?
14777,"I can guarantee military strategists in China have been watching with glee at how chaotic, uncoordinated, and inept the US response has been."
14778,Along with how easily US society can be manipulated and divided by conspiracy theories and ideological propaganda they're probably designing the perfect playback for a slamming invasion and conquer.
14779,"Turns out the West is a society of narcissistic whiners, living in a society where you fight for survival against your countrymen to win as individuals, casualties be damned."
14780,The East on the other hand is a society that focuses on teamwork and empathy to win as a team.
14781,2020 has really disillusioned me with the Western world.

14789,The new normal idiots never give up it seems
14790,Be a decent person
14791,I’m pretty lucky in that remote learning is actually going REALLY well and the parents in my class of 24 were all happy enough that they elected to stay remote.
14792,"I just returned from nearly a decade of teaching internationally, where we had access to a lot more technology than public schools, so I was kind of prepared."
14793,Hoping it continues to go well!
14794,"But to do otherwise is ""socialist"" and and hence ""communist""."
14795,I really have no idea why working class folks who live by the paycheck don't care to try something different.
14796,"Socialism capitalism (no, those terms are not exclusive) does aim to promote more equality and a fairer system for all, but one hint of the ""s"" words and folks go into a fit without good reason."
14797,"&gt;Do you see me posting pictures with friends, drinking, playing beer games and shit?"
14798,"No you clueless fuck

14804,"&gt; Monoclonal antibodies, such as casirivimab and imdevimab, may be associated with worse clinical outcomes when administered to hospitalized patients with COVID-19 requiring high flow oxygen or mechanical ventilation."
14805,"I wonder how much this treatment costs and if it’s just going to be offered to older, wealthy individuals who can afford to keep the chance of severe disease to a minimum."
14806,"China isn't blocking an investigation into Fort Detrik, in-fact China called for one, which the US responded by leaving the WHO."
14807,That's the storage temperature.
14808,It's not actually injected at that temperature.
14809,The Pfizer vaccine can be refrigerated like a normal shot for 5 days.
14810,It would be extremely unsafe to inject something at -70 degrees

14813,Isolation?
14814,I’m sorry you’re going through this.
14815,"As a Floridian, I also considered riding this out in Colorado because of the state’s early success."
14816,Florida has had zero restrictions on businesses for a few months now.
14817,"Before that, the restrictions were fairly light."
14818,"The big cities have local mask ordinances, which is probably one of the reasons why we aren’t North Dakota."
14819,"Still, the virus is growing."
14820,Some context.
14821,Floridians have learned to live in a situation that is far from ideal.
14822,Our state does not have an income tax.
14823,We are completely dependent on property tax (which is capped at 3% raise a year for home owners) and sales taxes (our bread and butter).
14824,"Tourism is our life blood, so the pressure to “act normal” has been tremendous."
14825,I think there are still people waiting for unemployment support.
14826,Here is what I can tell you... you have to actively protect yourself from other people.
14827,Buy self-protective masks and lots of hand sanitizer and soap.
14828,Give people on the sidewalk a lot of space.
14829,"Also, Try not to let other people’s irresponsible behavior stress you out too much because too much stress will deplete the mental health resources you need to stay focused."
14830,Example.
14831,We grocery shop once a week and we wipe our packages.
14832,"Everyone thinks we’re crazy, but we don’t care."
14833,"It takes half an hour a week to wipe, and the fact is, the virus is so common now, we’d rather be relaxed around the items we bring into our home than even slightly worried."
14834,Why?
14835,"Because even a little worry, over time, hurts our discipline and resolve."
14836,"There is a ton of pressure to “act normal.” Friends and family getting together in enclosed spaces, coworkers pulling their masks down to talk... it takes mental strength to kindly tell loved ones We can’t come over, to diplomatically ask a coworker to please speak to us masked."
14837,Believe me.. these little things will chip away at your resolve.
14838,"In Florida, that is by design."
14839,Our governor has adopted the idea that we should pursue “natural herd immunity.” At least Colorado doesn’t have that...
14840,"I think your gov does care, it just doesn’t have the federal money to shut down."
14841,"So, just this once.. I’m telling you to act like a Floridian!"
14842,Haha
14843,[removed]
14844,The vaccine must be safe long term.
14845,"Given that the technology used (RNA) is new, a two months test on a small sample size isn’t really enough to stop the skepticism of many."
14846,"Also, the French gov having done a piss poor communication job in last 9 months doesnt help to improve public trust in bio-pharmacological companies / gov policies."

14852,I see that Trump had increased testing by now that he's lost
14853,Expect a bunch of sensationalist articles about hundreds of people dying the day after they got the vaccine.
14854,This is what happened in Korea when the elderly were the first group being vaccinated for the flu this year.
14855,"Not smart, lots of people jamming up the medical system now got the virus in a bar."
14856,Someone pays for it everywhere.
14857,It is unusual for a patient to pay out of pocket for a flu shot even the US.
14858,That does not mean that the shot us FREE.
14859,Someone manufactured that vaccine with specialized labor in an expensive facility.
14860,"So yeah, you pay for the flu shot or someone else pays for you."
14861,No he didn't exist.
14862,"Someone with last name Li did exist, he had a 10 minute police visit, went back to work the next day to treat patients and caught COVID a week later."
14863,If he got arrested he would still be alive.
14864,Yes?
14865,My sister is due at the end of January.
14866,Luckily she and her husband take this virus seriously.
14867,"because antibodies are not the only imprinting left after our body is done with the illness, t-cells also play a role in remembering effective defensive strategies, and those last for years, even for life sometimes."
14868,"Gov: “Wear masks”
&gt;&gt;
People: “No”

Same people months later: “Lockdowns and masks don’t work!”"
14869,"Look, I'm gonna bite."

14884,"Quite often they are not people's first choice and instead a last resort and I understand that, you have nothing to lose at that point."
14885,"But actually if the treatment is suitable, people should do them earlier if it is appropriate."

Germany, neither."
14889,"They're not as bad as the absolute showers running the US/UK, but they're cut from the same unqualified, incompetent cloth."
14890,Partisan politics is toxic.

14894,"&gt; 9.4% of the patients who received the placebo didn’t contract COVID

That's a really deceptive way of looking at it: Suppose that COVID continues spreading for six months at the current rate (200,000 infections per day) and the vaccine works at the same rate."
14895,"Then by June 99.96% of vaccinated people will not have contracted COVID, but 10% of non-vaccinated people will have been infected."
14896,That delta only grows over time.
14897,It does make it harder to social distance 🤷
14898,This is actually the reason why almost everyone thinks they’re better looking/smarter/more financially well-off than they actually are.

14935,"I'll preface this by saying that you're absolutely right, this shit is unacceptable."
14936,But I think the reason there's a desire to keep kids in school is just that schools/teachers were *not* prepared to transition to online.
14937,I was a senior in high school last year and a college freshman this year so I hope that gives me some grounds to speak on it.
14938,"Learning online is difficult, exhausting, and confusing for every party involved (including parents, im guessing)."
14939,It sucks.
14940,"Teachers who primarily teach in person classes aren't equipped to make a sudden transition to online, and rightfully so because it's fundamentally different."
14941,It's just as taxing on students who find it difficult to focus on a computer screen for hours.
14942,But yeah fuck anyone wanting their kids to go back
14943,Yep.
14944,And adults.
14945,"I have family members, that I consider somewhat estranged now, that have espoused anti-mask sentiments and allowed their kids to go to in-person school and play football and go to church...it's  honestly so repulsive that they don't even realize how much they're contributing to the spread."
14946,"Even if the kids don't directly get sick now...like you mentioned, they very well could see complications spring up later."
14947,"If you see 30% wearing a mask where it's not mandatory, in a country like US, then you should feel lucky bro."
14948,"77% is, but most of that area isn't where the meat is."

14951,The obsession with Sweden on this subreddit is pathelogical.
14952,Why isn't there more criticism for countries like Belgium and the Czech Republic both of whom had almost the same amount of deaths per capita in the last two months as Sweden did during the entirety of the first wave?
14953,"There is almost no criticism of the Czech strategy which put almost all of their eggs in the ""masks are the silver bullet basket""."
14954,November in Czechia has been the second deadliest month for any EU country since the pandemic started.
14955,"The statements that the health authorities in Sweden have made about projections of immunity have been baseless but so are statements by the CDC, IHME and the WHO that if everyone wore masks the pandemic would be over."
14956,"This is observably false as countries like France, Italy, Spain, and  Belgium all have 95%+ mask compliance."
14957,This has almost no criticism here and it is the same level of magical thinking as thinking that Sweden has herd immunity.

15012,"But as someone who is in an age/health bracket that doesn’t put me much at risk of dying, I’m not putting my life on pause."

15017,"They can still travel within the country, most states haven't shut down their state borders."
15018,"Unlike most americans, Trump actually deals with foreigners."
15019,And being exposed to them he now has come to understand no one takes him seriously.
15020,He knows after the election he was shat out by world leaders.
15021,He must see their looks and their attitudes towards him.
15022,And decided it is no more use to be in these places.
15023,"This paper is more than a month old, and things are shifting pretty quickly on the vaccine front."
15024,"[The Pfizer trial did start including children as of last month](https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/26/health/covid-vaccine-pfizer-trial-kids/index.html), and hopefully the trials for other upcoming vaccines will do so as well"
15025,&gt; Hopefully 2021 can find a way to unite everyone.
15026,"The psychopaths will have to meet the rest of us at least halfway though - by admitting who the actual President is

I don't see that happening."
15027,And I don't see the sane majority willing to agree with the looney minority on who the President.
15028,"Yo, just look at what happened with cases in Canada post thanksgiving."
15029,Yall are in for a treat.
15030,Huh?

15032,"Without lockdown it stays exponential, in Germany it was exponential until we did a lockdown, now it is still slowly increasing."

15034,Don't wash it before cooking though - the process not only spreads salmonella all over your kitchen but can now also spread corona too.
15035,"The reproductive number is around r2 in most places, so your gathering could potentially infect 100s of people in just a short timeframe with a single carrier and no proper isolation."
15036,Its madness to even consider getting together with anyone outside your own household and a perfect example of how its spreading like wildfire over there.
15037,Weird article
15038,That's reality.
15039,There's no way to enforce such a mandate without significantly restricting air travel first.
15040,How's Target been?
15041,I haven't been there since early March.
15042,:(
15043,Millions...
15044,"Ah, hopefully, no one spent millions on a study to find that out..."
15045,Here is a freebie...
15046,Entitled fucks will do whatever they want - because entitled - duh?
15047,no study needed.
15048,"and since this is the internet I can say if you don't agree your selfish and ""ENTITLED"" haha."
15049,but then again some people just have problems following guidelines like on a box of whatever that reads open this end they do the opposite and contents spill out on the floor
15050,Stopping people from traveling would be nearly impossible in this country

15060,I disagree.
15061,"Before the pandemic, peor I know would travel to visit their families all the time, especially for Thanksgiving and Christmas, and I'd families together all over Facebook."
15062,And there were plenty of gym rats and people going to the gym several times a week.
15063,"I worked at a fitness center so I may be biased there, but several of my friends lifted weights or took classes."
15064,"People weren't vocal about it because it was just part of their lives, like eating and sleeping."
15065,[removed]
15066,"Yeah, if I ever get the funds or sewing ability to I'd love to start making/customizing fashion masks with like one huge flower or something on the side of one of them, stuff like that that's specifically made to go with more a understated, fashionable/stylish jacket, suit, hat, or dress."
15067,Right now all I have are pattern masks that are too loud to really  go with anything nice or stylish.
15068,"Especially as someone who's disabled and prone to immune flare-ups at every little thing myself, I'd also really much rather not catch or spread anything that causes sickness or disability, either."
15069,You can also see the TSA travel numbers here and it doesn't look that extremely high (yet): https://www.tsa.gov/coronavirus/passenger-throughput
15070,"I mean... the premise here is they haven't yet contracted covid, so it's either down to precautions, luck, or both."
15071,Would you like to have a conversation about this or just lol?
15072,"It has to be, right?"
15073,Is there even a question that people would need to pay to be vaccinated?
15074,"A quick google search of “covid death rate US” shows 2.2%, per [johns hopkins](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality)"
15075,No it is not.
15076,The UK does not have fox news but people there act almost equally retarded.
15077,It's safer than with 10 people.
15078,Is it safe ?
15079,No.
15080,"Tortankum it's pointless, let's not waste our time."
15081,"They call us ""seasonality deniers"" (which is wrong in the first place) but don't even understand that if Corona spreads stronger in **one** winter that this is no proof for ""strong seasonality""."
15082,At the same time the studies show that Corona has a relatively weak seasonality (compared to the flu) but they don't care about studies.
15083,"Masks should be normalized in the future if you have to go out while sick with anything, honestly"
15084,And possibly Donald Trump Jr.
15085,"I'm speaking purely about the US here, though some other countries can relate."
15086,The economy is structured so people's economic freedom is very limited.
15087,The range of activities most people can afford are very small.
15088,Most people do not get to take yearly vacations.
15089,They do not get to travel.
15090,They do not get to buy expensive toys.
15091,They don't have houses with heated pools and tennis courts and gyms.
15092,The only real enjoyment most people get is going to a bar or eating out on the weekends.
15093,They go and see a movie or sit with friends.
15094,Or they sit at home and watch TV.
15095,And that's it.
15096,"So when people are asked to stop doing those things, what's left?"
15097,"You text your friends, maybe skype."
15098,You sit at home and watch TV.
15099,A lot of people don't even have yards to go do anything outside.
15100,"Or their yards are so small, all you can do is sit outside."
15101,And it's been this way for two generations now.
15102,"Once that post war boom ended and all that wealth was snatched up, this is what we're left with."
15103,Some people simply don't know anything else.
15104,Covid has really just rubbed our noses in all the ways we've been doing it wrong.
15105,"Now our future relies on telling the most overworked, underpaid, and just demoralized people to sit in a beige box and stare at the wall for a few months."
15106,"Oh, and you're not even going to get any help while you do it."
15107,I'm not trying to make excuses for irresponsible people.
15108,"It's just that if we had our shit together before this, we'd be fine."
15109,And there have been people saying it all along but they were ignored or called very nasty things by anyone in charge.
15110,"It's important that no matter how bad this gets, instead of blaming other poor people for being stupid/irresponsible/fat/lazy/etc, we blame the people who have been in charge for decades and who refused to be stewards of the country's well-being."
15111,"That being said, yes it's very bad to be traveling right now and nobody should do it."
15112,"When do you think we will have our next ""real"" summer?"
15113,2022?
15114,23?!
15115,24?!?
15116,!
15117,"So individual states, already overwhelmed and unable to effectively manage the worse humanitarian crisis our country has experienced in 100 years--not to mention levels of state and local governments fiscal insolvency--are going to expeditiously distribute tens of millions of vaccines this year."
15118,I hope to God it happens but such success is nearly unfathomable.
15119,"To date we've performed 180,000,000 tests nationwide and our execution has been   underwhelming."
15120,"If these past nine months have highlighted anything, it's our government's astounding inadequacies."
15121,"Buckle up Reddit peeps and keep yourselves and those you love, as safe as you can."
15122,People complaining about lockdowns are the same people that don't follow the rules.
15123,Change my mind
15124,From parent to parent let me say thst these anti maskers must not have kids.
15125,Parents know how germy kids are and how many sicknesses they get easily and spread in schools and daycare.
15126,The government wants to experiment by opening daycare and schools and seeing what happens and now with all the superspreading going on everything is basically at the point of no return and so many kids are going to suffer.
15127,"In my neck of the woods, the elderly in old folks homes are the 1a priority and the other medical personnel are the 1b priority."
15128,You're going to have a lot more impact vaccinating residents of an old folks home than you are vaccinating a dozen doctors and nurses in their 30s.
15129,"I mean, that's assuming you have a family you can live with and you're not alone in a tiny apartment horribly depressed."
15130,Bill Gates is the one person that might convince me to get a vaccine sooner than later.

#WHY ARE WE AN ANOMALY?!?!??!?"
15139,"Edit: to be clear we decided (after moving to a new home after 25 years in the same home that our first christmas in this new home, should be spent in a destination where we can remember forever because itd be all of our first times in hawaii) against making this happen because even tho my mothers health is not the greatest, that trip could be her last if we exposed her to covid."
15140,I browse r/wallstreetbets so I was already autistic before the vaccine
15141,What did Norway an Finland do different apart of the mask mandate in public transportation just recently imposed?

15145,"i was going to upvote until i saw the ""/s""."

15149,"Our parking lot was FULL the entire day, there had to be close to a thousand people in the store at a few points in the day."

15159,"Neither of the usual Swedish comparisons, Norway, Denmark or Finland, used masks to stop their first wave."
15160,Many countries in the EU with mask rules have not stopped a second wave.
15161,While masks may work on an a theoretical and possibly on an individual level.
15162,They don't seem to prevent second waves.
15163,"At this rate, cases may outpace our capacity to test, our capacity to hospitalize and treat, and our capacity to bury and cremate."
15164,"I'm not going to bet any numbers, but I'm sure all of the usual metrics in January will dwarf what we have now."
15165,"Uh...I actually like wearing a mask sometimes, mostly at the store because I know my mask stops me from spraying spit everywhere every time I talk."
15166,I can also mouth lyrics to songs I like without anyone suspecting a thing when I'm wearing a mask.
15167,"Part of me wants a vaccine right away but the other part of me is like, ""Yo, Thalidomide""."
15168,I think I misunderstood the post.
15169,"Target definitely doesn't do it for free with no insurance, but they do give the gift cards if you do get it with or without insurance."
15170,"I just paid $20/PP to get it at Costco since we don't have insurance so I was alarmed that I might have missed out on getting it for actual free, haha."
15171,"I think it would be wise for anyone to do their own research, but done in an honest way rather than pandering to conspiracy theory influences."
15172,"There is no doubt that getting a vaccine out in this time frame is a remarkable achievement when considering the development of other vaccines, and that should be considered."
15173,"I also think that it is natural to hold a degree of healthy skepticism given that we generally learn from experience, and whereas we have the experience with say a flu jab to know what risk we're taking, we don't have the experience with this vaccine."
15174,There will undoubtedly be a risk associated with this vaccine as there are with other vaccines.
15175,"On the other hand, the damage this virus is doing here in England and around the world is immeasurable."
15176,"According to the Washington Post only 100 children were included in Pfizer/BioNTech trials from start to finish, all aged between 12-15 years old."

15181,"It's not exactly comparable though, one big difference is the season, another is climate, a third is travel, both work and leisure."
15182,"And they haven't had their second season yet, hopefully they won't because of vaccination."
15183,The spread this second season is so much worse than the first.
15184,"Hopefully, a few years from now, thorough analysis will teach us what exactly the deciding factors are controlling the spread."
15185,The problem is a lot tougher than a lot of people seem to be thinking.
15186,In California we're seeing a 5% positivity rate.
15187,So 95% negative.
15188,Presumably we could see a lot more positives before we run out of testing capacity.

15223,"It will be a big deal for nursing homes, medical staff and perhaps front-line workers like police."
15224,The spread will slow some as those industries may be some of the top spreaders and stopping the spread is what will really offer release much more so than stopping lethality.
15225,"So it depends how they use vaccines, like who gets them, but either way 20 million vaccinated is only going to slow it down some."
15226,Philly Redditor here who tutored at a college here.
15227,Out last day on campus was Friday the 13th of March after a semi-normal spring break week the week before.
15228,"President of the college originally announced closure was only going to be for the 16th &amp; 17th, then the mass e-mail came in an hour after I finished my tutoring shift around 16:30 saying the campus will be closed for 2 weeks."
15229,We are still working &amp; taking classes remotely these days &amp; I am now used to it.
15230,The college went from normal on the 9th to a ghost town on the 12th &amp; 13th.
15231,Every morning my USA Today &amp; CNBC feeds were showing some crazy headlines.
15232,"Got screenshots of the headlines, some Reddit, Worldometer, &amp; the markets from those days."
15233,Photos of front page of some local &amp; national newspapers for that week &amp; the weekend.
15234,"It's hard to believe that here we are 8 months later with case &amp; death totals many orders of magnitude higher than back then but life just feels like normal again but a totally new normal with masks, minimal time in stores, and working at home."
15235,Glad no-one I know was badly affected by the virus but still am scared of this thing.
15236,I was thinking we were going to get an Italy-style lockdown here but it never happened.
15237,I'll probably never think of a Friday the 13th the same way again.
15238,It really felt apocalyptic after the announcements in the few days leading up to it.
15239,And that is just deaths.
15240,"The long term result of lung, heart, and brain damage is potentially scary af as well."
15241,Exponential growth can't continue forever.
15242,"There'll be limiting factors in the actual number of people who can be infected per day just based on population distribution and behaviours etc., even without control measures being taken."
15243,At some point the numbers will plateau.
15244,Not sure what number that is though.
15245,Iirc the government can only make recommendations (which is the last step they can take before taking free will away from its citizens) if they have strong evidence to support it.
15246,I want to remember reading that their conclusion was that mask leads to touching the area around your nose and mouth more often and create a false sense of security possibly leading to people washing their hands not as often and not disinfecting shopping carts etc.

15251,What precaution are you taking by traveling and potentially speeding this.
15252,You could be an asymptotic carrier.
15253,We have phones.
15254,We have the technology to remotely see people.
15255,Stop rolling the damn dice.
15256,Maybe you go and everything’s fine.
15257,Or maybe you go and a relative catches it and dies.
15258,As a person who’s buried both parents before the age of 40- stop acting do damn cavalier about this.
15259,When somebody gets sick and you watch them die on a vent?
15260,"Take it from me who watched my mother die on a vent (not from COVID as she passed before all this crap started), it’s not fun."
15261,Making the decision to pull the plug on your last surviving parent and thus make yourself an orphan is not fun or easy.
15262,If the doctors had told me I could have saved my mother’s life and all I had to do was wear a simple mask?
15263,I’d have hot glued the thing to my face to have more time with her.
15264,"Some of you have never lost someone close to you and it really, really shows."
15265,RemindMe!
15266,2 years
15267,"A few months ago I would have agreed with you, but I’m no longer convinced this is a specifically American problem."
15268,Consider [this](https://www.newsweek.com/europes-death-rate-over-3-times-higher-us-covid-surges-globally-1548788) recent post about the European death rate surging past the US death rate: lots of places are having crazy surges.
15269,"I’m actually starting to think of the argument that “American individualism is causing this” as another example of American exceptionalism: we want to believe we’re different and the best, even at catching the virus and dying."
15270,But the data show that’s not so.
15271,Most of the places that have avoided this fate have done so by imposing mandatory lockdowns.
15272,Happy to provide a CA/LA breakdown (I love data) although I obviously meant comparatively speaking.
15273,Feel free to browse the referenced sources.
15274,- % positive rate is not really a relevant metric for comparison to other places since we have been testing for longer than any other metropolitan region.
15275,We were the first major city to offer free COVID tests to residents and still have massive drive up areas (e.g.
15276,Dodger Stadium) running every day.
15277,"Testing is not new or hard to come by, and neither is the overall COVID situation."
15278,So we are not experiencing “panic testing” that is now rampant in other more saturated states.
15279,Our numbers are not being diluted by unnecessary testing of fearful but healthy folks.
15280,"People who get tested here nowadays are definitely more likely to be ill, but that doesn’t mean there are a disproportionate number of COVID cases."
15281,- California - of which LA County is by far the most infected region - is #23 in testing volume (lots of testing) but #42 in cases (low relative infection).
15282,Both of these ranks are per capita (Worldometer).

15289,"Some highlights: 

- approx 50% of hospital beds remaining

- hospitalized patients are 73% latinx, this gives an improved timeline of it running itself out than if the worst cases were more equally spread out demographically

- we have 30+ days of PPE after adjusting for COVID utilization rates

15295,And now they use dismal wages and easy credit to create an underclass of indebted indentured servants who are forced to grind and grind up a never ending mountain and who live their lives one missed paycheck away from homelessness.

15300,That might happen because you know there's going to be people who immediately stop following restrictions the day they get the vaccine.

15329,Now maybe it wouldn't not have hit 150 million.. or maybe it would have.
15330,They are only projections based very little modern experience with large scale pandemics.

15446,of course that doesn't happen and me playing monday morning quarterback is not helpful either
15447,Only one state had a really long lockdown — the other states were able to squash their first wave and keep numbers down with aggressive contact tracing.
15448,&gt;	Why don’t you have a look at Asia then.
15449,Lots of Countries doing well there.
15450,"Yeah, but not as good as Taiwan, Australian, and New Zealand, which are the three countries OP listed, and which are all islands."
15451,"Thinking on this more, I think a double proportionality model would probably be the most “fair”."
15452,Like if a county went 60 votes R and 40 votes B (Total people in county = 100).
15453,Then weight covid cases by that amount.
15454,"So if 10 people got covid, 6 of those cases go on the red portion and 4 blue."
15455,My reasoning behind this conceptually is to control for land artifacts eg—state/county lines from politics and covid.
15456,There are a lot of bathtub shaped frequency population distributions.
15457,I’m so happy you used per capita on this data.
15458,"I hate to even say this because I wish it wasn’t true, but I wonder (suspect) a comorbidity factor being if one lives in a politically specific leaning area relative to rest of populations as things went “political”."

15490,15 years ago we had friends (teacher) that paid $1400 per month in health insurance for their family of three.
15491,Plus Americans have to pay deductibles when they go to the doctor!
15492,Plus a overall plan deductible!
15493,I pay $0 when I go to the doctor.
15494,$0 when I go to the ER.
15495,$0 when my one year old was hospitalized for three nights.

15497,All medical supplies and pumping supplies and they sent us home with stuff.
15498,Plane ride home paid for.
15499,Plus the government gave us a $150 per day payment to help with expenses of being away from home.
15500,"No, I think we’re much better off financially than the US."
15501,Even if our tax rate may or may not be higher.

15607,"Our family has always been cautious during the pandemic- wearing masks, I try to physically stay away from people when I shop, I use hand sanitizer every time I hop in the car, socializing is limited to talking outside, 6+ft apart, not eating in restaurants, etc."
15608,"However- I get squirrely, and don’t mind “safely” running errands during the day, usually several times a week."
15609,Well.
15610,That is going to have to stop.
15611,"I mean, to the point ordering groceries online, and pick up only at stores."
15612,This is horrifying.
15613,"I’m in my 40s, and while I am less at risk of dying than older people dying, I’m not kidding myself that it couldn’t affect me badly."
15614,Who knows?
15615,"We don’t, until we get it."
15616,But I don’t want to pass it on to others.
15617,I don’t want to end up taking a hospital bed from someone else.
15618,I don’t want to strain the system any more than it is.
15619,"I watched in horror to what was happening in NY in the spring- and now we are on course for it to happen here, and yet there are STILL people traveling for Thanksgiving."
15620,We are screwed.
15621,Are there any bar owners there that are staying closed on principle?
15622,"Sorry, I'm done."
15623,I've sourced reliable data and asked 3 times now for you to do the same.
15624,"You can sit there and attack it all you want but until you provide me multiple reliable sources backing your side, I've got better things to do on a Sunday."
15625,"I didn't ask for your opinion, I asked what data informed your opinion."
15626,Yeah those were all big spreading events as well.
15627,Any large gathering of people is.
15628,What part of this area you not getting?
15629,how do you deal with a situation where half the population is responsible and the other half is the opposite?
15630,Do you enforce draconian measures on the responsible people too?
15631,It's a fucked up situation.
15632,Was he hired by trump?if so he's lying.
15633,Equating the coronavirus to the flu instantly invalidates any argument you might have made.

15635,That would be...so good.cry worthy good to know we won’t drag in a virus to kill grandma.
15636,"Without getting too technical, statisticians have calculated that to be sufficient sample size."
15637,To get them back in school safely?
15638,"Should we also put overweight people at the bottom of the list, after all it's usually caused by their bad decisions?"
15639,"What about the guy who has a collapsed lung he suffered from doing an extreme sport, pretty bad decision to participate in such a risky activity."
15640,To the bottom of the list he goes.
15641,Can't you see how your approach will lead to a situation where people would be rated and categorized for their life decisions?
15642,It would probably take hold at about ten times the number dead.
15643,2.5 million ought to do it.
15644,South Georgian here.
15645,Somebody please help.
15646,"It's not physically locking the doors and not letting them into in-person classes, it's locking them out of online classes, which does nothing to help."
15647,"Yes, the preclinical trials were obviously very incomplete data."
15648,It’s still a datapoint when we have very few other data points regarding the Oxford vaccine.
15649,I’m in the camp of not really caring about antibody titers ect.
15650,The actual immune response a vaccine triggers is far more complicated than simply making antibodies.
15651,A vaccine could make tons of antibodies and fail spectacularly or not make many at all and work great.
15652,"Ultimately a vaccine is (and should) be judged by its ability to prevent transmission, prevent severe disease, and it’s safety profile."
15653,We have data right now showing that for all three of those criteria Biontech is great.
15654,We have preliminary data suggesting the same for Moderna.
15655,We have exactly zero data on any of the three for Oxford.
15656,Maybe it comes out Oxford is the best of the bunch.
15657,But on 11-22-2020 to say you prefer the Oxford vaccine seems much more like fanfare than science.
15658,"It’s a “lumped parameter” model, as they say in physics."
15659,We’re mostly seeing spikes in the Midwest now though.
15660,&gt;The notion that the handling of a once-in-a-100-years pandemic has any bearing on the capability of a nation to ensure a good life for its citizens for the remaining 99 years is ridiculous.
15661,This is something that has continually pissed me off about the anti-Western narratives being peddled online.
15662,"The vast majority of the time, there isn't a pandemic."
15663,"Western countries provide a hugely superior standard of living to the countries this sub drools over, and the single biggest reason for that is the individual rights that this sub blames for the poor coronavirus response."
15664,"There's a reason why so many people emigrate from non-Western countries to Western ones, and so few do the opposite."
15665,Most people would much rather endure hardship for a short time in order to have freedom for their whole lives; being relatively safe for one year does not make up for a life of oppression.
15666,"If everyone throughout history thought the way people on this sub do, Western Europeans would never have bothered fighting WW2: they'd have said it was stupid to risk your life in a war just to have ""freedumb""."
15667,I should thank God that generation largely isn't around any more: they'd have been sickened to see their great-grandchildren mock the idea of preferring a lifetime of freedom over one year of slightly higher safety.
15668,"And ""one year of slightly higher safety"" is right."
15669,"China's appalling disregard for the environment means that in the long-term, its citizens are far more likely to die from avoidable respiratory problems than Westerners are, despite our problems with the virus."
15670,20-49 is a good chunk of the US population.
15671,The 50-69 block is .005/99.5% according to the same document.
15672,"(I would link it again but I think people can look at the parent comment and click) 

I’m not downplaying it, I’m giving people the actual data."
15673,"Yes if you’re 70+ and you have the 94.6% rate, you might want to take extra precautions."
15674,"At the same time, if I was that old, I’d probably be more willing to accept risk because the chance of death from a non-covid event is higher, and giving up your life for a year when you don’t have much time left would really be hard to do."
15675,"People are hopeless , I’m surprised we have survived our own entitlement and stupidity this long"
15676,Their economy will collapse.
15677,"Right, but to say nobody has been talking about it is nonsense."
15678,"A lot of lawmakers are pushing for it, and many others don’t give a shit enough about the American people to do anything"
15679,It was Iheanacho i’m okay
15680,I love this logic.
15681,"If your aren’t at risk, go visit the people you care about that are at risk!"
15682,I hope you are going to enjoy large indoor gatherings with all your friends and family this holiday season.
15683,This is just a taste of what humanity will look like dealing with an environmental crisis.
15684,Selfishness beyond all reason.
15685,We criticize Elon Musk for getting off earth but then humanity can't be trusted to do the right thing when their lives depend on it.
15686,"Yeah...it's not impossible, but the stars would REALLY have to align perfectly for it to happen on that timeline."
15687,"I think that instead of talking about the best possible scenario, they would do really well to manage people's expectations at this point."
15688,"That's been a consistent problem throughout this whole mess and every single time it results in people being more frustrated, more angry and more rebellious than they would have been otherwise."
15689,"They should tell us November, and then when it happens by August or September (a much more realistic timeline) everyone will be over the moon."
15690,"The sample size was 44,000 people - 22,000 got the vaccine and 22,000 got a placebo."
15691,"During the course of the trial, about 160 participants became infected with Covid."
15692,152 of them were in the placebo group and only 8 were in the vaccine group.
15693,Therefore the vaccine prevented 95% of the infections that statistically would have normally happened in the vaccine group during that time period.
15694,"I live in a very small ranching town, I am around my family daily because of our line of work."
15695,We usually have family travel from surrounding towns that we dont see daily for thanksgiving but we cancled EVERYTHING.
15696,And they only live 30 minutes to an hour away which is nothing considering where we live.
15697,1 million total if we’re lucky.
15698,We’ll probably be at 200k a month in January or more.
15699,You are cherry picking from those results.
15700,A million people traveled through airports in a single day.
15701,RIP
15702,How many tests do you think we're doing right now?
15703,isn’t kill thy neighbor one of the ten commandments?
15704,or is it don’t kill anyone... i’m starting to think american christians should read the actual bible instead of the prosperity gospel pamphlets they hand out at for-profit corporate church.
15705,"I feel like everyone is saying this, but almost no one is considering that most of “that side” will have already contracted the virus by May, or at least enough to the point where natural immunity and vaccine immunity effectively ends the pandemic for the USA."
15706,"Especially at the rate infections are going right now, and the amount of travel for the holidays yet to be underway."
15707,In Ontario we added 1588 on Sat (our record).
15708,We have just shy of 4x the population of alberta.
15709,"Stay safe out there, friends"
15710,Canada also tests at a lower rate than the US.
15711,NY routinely does 4 times as many tests as Ontario does per day.
15712,Cant wait to go to a fucking party.

15734,I was really worried about all the idiots with out masks and holiday surges.
15735,Thank god we aren’t going.
15736,"For thanksgiving I’m just inviting my grandpa, who hasn’t had contact with anyone in a while cause he got the coronavirus and he’s scared of it, my moms boyfriend, my mom, and me :)"
15737,That's a bit simplistic.
15738,I would suggest anyone to watch A Century of the Self.
15739,This goes back to post WW1 and atomizing the population to keep them from organizing through propaganda used to divert people's emotions from one another and onto consumer products.
15740,It really took effect post WW2 as the depression slowed it down.
15741,It means that you intimating only stupid people would carry on with their lives simply isn’t the case.
15742,"Florida is open and enjoying itself, same goes for many others states and hundreds of millions of people."
15743,The sooner the minority realizes that the sooner this all goes away and you did something new to be afraid of.
15744,"like 20k people were in placebo group and 20k people received an actual vaccine, then they waited like 3 months."
15745,Out of the placebo group like 170 people got COVID and in the vaccine group only like 6 got COVID.
15746,"I didn't mean to say that they don't protect the wearer, just that they also protect others, and that the protection for others is probably even greater than the protection for the wearer."
15747,My dear friend's older sister is a nurse in TN.
15748,"She was told very early (like, April) that she could volunteer to go to the COVID ward and be adequately trained for it, or she could wait until it's so bad that there is no time for training, and she just gets thrown in the COVID ward one day."
15749,She chose the former.
15750,She has been in the COVID ward ever since.
15751,"She is now so emotionally and physically drained and exhausted, she is looking for another nursing job (she's been looking for a few months and have herself a hard deadline of Thanksgiving)."
15752,"If she can't find one by next week, she is giving up and moving home to live with her parents and take a break from working."
15753,She loves being a nurse.
15754,But not like this.
15755,Not anymore.
15756,Not after eight grueling months of utter disregard from the people whose lives she is trying to save.
15757,It is fucking disgusting.

15764,My mother (who lives an hour away and i haven't seen since April) just told me yesterday that she and my father have had COVID for at least the last 10 days.
15765,I'm pretty sure she didn't tell me until now because at the beginning of this pandemic I gave both my parents a lecture about running around all over the place and she knew I would lecture her again--which means she's clearly been going places while positive.
15766,"Otherwise, she would have told me earlier."

15774,Remember that the people you mention aren't necessarily the same and that many people on this subreddit are from places outside the US.
15775,"""pro-lockdown"" in some countries _does_ mean compensation for affected workers."
15776,This sounds like when people say what the writers of a show “have” to do.
15777,No one wants a lockdown or more lockdowns but “they” can’t control everything.
15778,Great example.
15779,Safety measures are put in place for a reason.
15780,"Seldom does the worst happen, but when it does... 

That applies well to the pandemic: we are collectively the safety measure, and each one of these maskless partygoers is dropping bolts on others not wearing hardhats."
15781,The odds of it being eradicated worldwide is zero.
15782,We don’t see polio in America but that doesn’t mean it’s not seen other places and has been brought into the US by travelers.
15783,"Hep A and B, whooping cough, rubella, tetanus, and measles are all obviously still around but not pandemic or epidemic level because the majority of us have had vaccines, and even then it’s important to remember no vaccine is 100% effective."

15786,"I am worried that even though this is very cheap, that it won't actually only cost less than $50."
15787,They charge you $30 for the vaccine and $100 for administering it and $75 for transportation costs and $50 refrigeration fee.
15788,These companies are very good at manipulating public opinion while lying about the actual cost.
15789,No it’s called a few billion in their pockets from the govt and billions more in stock prices.
15790,Yes!

15799,&gt;	What difference does three more months make?
15800,We already have nine months of observation.
15801,This is such an ignorant statement.
15802,9 months for a vaccine is *nothing*.
15803,That’s the fastest ever by a huge margin (like 3 years).
15804,This is a calculated risk because of the severity of the pandemic.
15805,I guarantee you there’s no way any regulatory agency would even consider a 9 month vaccine trial  under any other circumstances.
15806,"Especially autoimmune disorders, which are the reason why no mRNA vaccine prior to this one has been successful, can take 2+ years to show up."

15815,Yep.
15816,ICU Stipends are twice normal pay rate and that’s before any overtime multiplier.
15817,Every shift is understaffed regardless.
15818,Meanwhile the OR nurses are just returning to normal staffing levels after a bunch of them were laid off at the start when elective procedures were cancelled.

15829,* Working extra shifts because short staffed when colleagues caught it and have to quarantine.
15830,"Or extra hours needed because operating near, at, or above capacity."
15831,* Emotional toll of seeing so many people in a bad state for a prolonged period of time.
15832,"* Fighting with family members that don't believe them, or family members that got a mild case and thus think everyone else is making up the severity of the situation."
15833,"Basically, they are getting worn down."
15834,And many thousands more are.
15835,There has been zero slow down of snowbirds coming here from what I’ve seen.

15842,You fight the good fight while these youngsters are going out.
15843,They should just sacrifice their party going years because it may slow down the spread of a virus that won't make them really sick.
15844,The great thing is we now have a really big carrot to motivate people.
15845,"With a vaccine or more that really work and a timeline to distribute, we have a good idea when this might end."
15846,So we should be messaging for people to hunker down for just a little bit longer.
15847,Articles like this are sending the right message.
15848,A few months ago there was the possibility the vaccines would fail and that we'd just need to learn to live with this virus and accept the losses.
15849,There was the chance we were just delaying the inevitable but that's luckily not how it's turning out.

15911,"Many of them were handed over to Agios Pavlos, Agios Dimitrios or 424(both hospitals) by order of the administration, so that the beds could be re-emptied and we could admit patients to the next general vigil, that is, with a terrible recycling of incidents, until we had already paid for all the beds."
15912,of the blue building and we managed to expand to the old neoclassical building of Hippocrates and tonight we will occupy the first building.
15913,The forecast for by tomorrow morning is to exceed 300 beds.
15914,Now I think you understand that numbers do not reflect the whole truth.
15915,When the clinic began its program in November it had planned to cover a maximum of 50 patients and its staff is required to cover 300 today.
15916,"I do not want to talk about fatigue, exhaustion, staff illness, as well as the waves of fear that prevail in the hospital, I take these for granted."
15917,I want to focus on the terrible conditions of unsafe on-call and hospitalization of our patients in Hippocrates: The wings are on average 50 people.
15918,The blue building has five wings across three floors and the most we can staff is with 1 specialist physician and 1 specialist physician for every 50 cases.
15919,Imports relate to moderate cases.
15920,"While in September and October we brought in a lot of people to watch, in November we stopped it and now we put on moderate cases because if we did not do it the beds would reach the beach."
15921,"Now we make more aggressive discharges, that is, we do not wait for the complete escape of the disease, but as soon as we feel safe that he can go home with oxygen, then we take him out."
15922,We do this in order to have some free beds because every 4 days Hippocrates has to reopen its gates as a general hospital.
15923,"A specialist and a specialist in the 50 wing work 26 hours dressed in a uniform without rest in cases where at least 30% are very heavy and now inside the wings we apply non-invasive mechanical ventilation, with special vapors that we had taken care to provide to keep them sick non-intubated as much as possible, to avoid admissions to the Intensive Care Unit as no beds are available."
15924,"Now in the Covid wards a percentage of cases normally and according to the law should not be treated there, but in the Intensive Care Units (ICU) with much more medical and nursing staff and monitors."
15925,"Unfortunately, there are no further doctors to support us, we have exhausted our efforts in staff who may know pathology and we have called ophthalmologists, ENT, surgeons, gynecologists, etc."
15926,"who are impossible to train in one day but we use them as auxiliary hands for blood sampling and examination of vital organs, etc."
15927,All this makes the treatment conditions terribly unsafe for the sick.
15928,"I know what criticism we made until we got here, and what we will say when that passes."
15929,"Unfortunately, however, we are now in the midst of a great fire and we must propose solutions that will save the world immediately."
15930,"Those we take out recycle the dispersion in the city
We asked to rent or order hotels in the city to get the discharges which are still positive because if we waited for them to be negative there would be no beds."
15931,Those we take out recycle the dispersion in the city.
15932,"Because one may not be able to sit alone for another ten days at home and therefore stick to one's family, which may consist of people belonging to vulnerable groups."
15933,"In Thessaloniki, the lockdown, unfortunately here we are, can not limit the dispersion because even the evacuations that return to their homes, create this vicious circle."
15934,"We asked for hotel units to stay for a week, to be provided with food, secretarial support and cleaning and to be given the medicines they need, something that can be done by the city authorities."
15935,It did not happen.
15936,We asked for the request of a place to create a unit where elderly people who have been discharged but need care will go.
15937,That did not happen either.
15938,"Thirdly, we asked for the involvement of the army because we believe that its health could strengthen EKAB, even strengthen the deliveries or some of our own emergency units."
15939,That did not happen either.
15940,"And finally, in the last week that things are going well, we asked for the order of the private nurses of Thessaloniki and of course already the day before yesterday we insist on the order of the ICU beds of the private clinics because there is absolutely nothing free."
15941,"The rate of intubation in Ippokratio is 3 to 5 per day and there is no bed anywhere in Northern Greece, having already used in-bed respirators beyond any safety limit."
15942,"We are at a point where we no longer feel tired due to the overexertion we have, but the doctors of Hippocrates may start shouting at the prosecutor tomorrow because they have no solution in the next intubations."
15943,There is no solution until tomorrow morning.
15944,We ourselves may be forced to call the prosecutor because we are not given any way out.
15945,"Apart from the absolutely dangerous conditions of hospitalization, I will describe the situation experienced by the nursing staff."
15946,"Today, as we speak, it is still an afternoon shift, and three nurses work in a shift of an average of 45-50 patients who need to be treated, to clean whoever gets dirty, to put a vein in whoever takes it out, to put oxygen back in whoever is stimulating and throws them, which happens, I can tell you in 20% of cases."
15947,"In addition, they must take the food, distribute it to the sick, feed them and give them water."
15948,"As you understand, in addition to all this, to contribute to the resuscitation or intubation of a critical patient."
15949,"As you can see, apart from the fact that the nurse runs non-stop, all this can not be done,


And I explain: Most sick people do not eat because many of them do not have the ability to eat on their own."
15950,"And if they are not elderly, there are people in their 60s who are so depressed, who have shortness of breath, who can not get out of bed, who can not get up and open the taper and eat, they do not even have the strength to take the bottle from the nightstand."
15951,"I do not want to be dramatic in the sense of the show, but I insist on these details because they are not illuminated by anyone."
15952,"In other words, we are not just talking about staff depletion, I am overlooking this at the moment, I am talking about the fact that patients do not have the basics many times in the shift."
15953,This is because it is humanly impossible to have them.
15954,"So this terribly big crime, along with the small invisible crimes it contains, I think has its culprits and there are many of us who have denounced it."
15955,"But my position, I think, is on how we from the inside and the movement from the outside should now focus on immediate solutions, at least as far as Northern Greece is concerned."
15956,"That is, to emit such an SOS so that our proposals are very clear, so that as many as possible are saved."
15957,"This means that tomorrow morning the ICUs of all private clinics in Thessaloniki will open, as will the wings of the private clinics in Thessaloniki, with a request."
15958,"Because tomorrow morning our general vigil ends, which will reach 300 patients and the next vigil is on Tuesday."
15959,Why should the university be forcing testing on students who are using 100% remote learning?
15960,"Some of these students aren’t even at the university or the surrounding community, and are living at home."
15961,Are they supposed to hop on a plane and risk exposure to take a saliva test before flying back home?
15962,How is that productive?
15963,And why should these students be locked out of ONLINE classes?
15964,They tens of thousands of people.
15965,"They compared how many got sick with the vaccine, versus how many got sick with just the placebo."
15966,I considered Biden to be pretty anti-lockdown.

15976,"""I dont care what you want"" the irony, so selfish"
15977,Religion is a wolf in sheep's clothing.
15978,This is just another reminder.
15979,"Too bad the local hospital can't deny members care -- They've made their choice to hasten their return to their ""savior"", let them go."
15980,Save the finite medical resources for those who actually want to stay here.

15982,Is this your first rhetorical question?
15983,The only difference here is that only one guy wins the lottery and 200.000 people a day win the covid.

15995,"Probably has an impact because people most likely to spread it, no longer have the funds to go out and party"
15996,"It ends eventually, vaccine will significantly help many people live a more normal life, and the rest will kind of just deal with it I suppose."
15997,"Everyone will have ample opportunity to get a vaccine, so honestly just kind of your fault after that"
15998,"Just as an aside, if anyone is worried about privacy of their sessions please note a majority of offices use secure video chat services designed for healthcare use (aka not zoom)"
15999,Yes!!
16000,It's obvious we are going through something similar as I totally understand what you're saying and have voiced these things in my own life.
16001,"The logical sense of needing a medicine that doesn't exist and the hope that it will be a meaningful treatment, key word being meaningful."
16002,"But still it's an experiment, so the unknown is scary!"
16003,One of the deciding factors for me was having access to the treatment before market.
16004,"Even if fsa approves it, it could take years to get to market."
16005,The only people that would have the treatment available to them are the ones who participated in the trial.
16006,"The fda will have a quicker process for this trial because it is an orphan disease with NO treatment, it could still take years to get to market."
16007,I wish you all the best in your medical journey as well.
16008,I hope you find meaningful treatment.
16009,"Well, its clear that having an opinion you disagree with justifies your righteous anger."
16010,Good to know.
16011,"You ever heard the phrase ""assume good intentions""?"
16012,"This is exactly the problem, no regard for seniors, people with preexisting conditions or healthcare workers."
16013,"Absolutely no restrictions, allowing for packed capacity and not enforcing masks."
16014,It’s sad.
16015,"We were doing well for awhile with keeping bars open and people being careful, but them Desantis just followed Trump’s lead and acted like COVID isn’t a problem."
16016,People participating in this are contributing to the deaths of their family and friends.
16017,Most Millennials are over the bar scene in general.
16018,"Even pre-Covid, a crowded bar wasn't very appealing to most Millennials"
16019,Because you idiots have never stopped socializing.
16020,"If we actually isolated for a brief period, we wouldn't be seeing almost 200k new daily cases."
16021,This is complete bullshit and you should stop spreading it.
16022,It’s had a huge impact.
16023,Daily new cases have plummeted.
16024,Hospitalizations and deaths lag for weeks so you should them dropping steeply through December
16025,Don't do that.
16026,Don't give me hope.
16027,It's called freedom.
16028,Bring the downvotes.
16029,compared to countries handeling it well certainly not.. atleast the restrictions show effect time for the US to do something

16033,I started getting a cough on Tuesday.
16034,I took a saliva swab on Wednesday and it came back negative.
16035,"However, I didn’t cough hard 3 times right before the test but I was coughing while in line."
16036,Also the cough I have is infrequent and nothing like the flu.
16037,On Friday I took the test again and coughed before and it came back negative.
16038,Does it sound like I’m fine ?

16047,"But now they are also associated with an unenviable mix of shambolic governance and draconian lockdowns, of creaking public healthcare systems, individual irresponsibility and unnecessary deaths."

16055,I don't exactly know what changed their minds but now they take it much more seriously.

16087,"Italy has registered 28,337 new coronavirus infections over the past 24 hours, the health ministry said on Sunday, down from 34,767 the day before."
16088,"The ministry also reported 562 COVID 19-related deaths, down from 692 on Saturday and 699 on Friday."
16089,"There were 188,747 coronavirus swabs carried out in the past day, the ministry said, against a previous 237,225."
16090,"Italy was the first Western country to be hit by the virus and has seen 49,823 COVID-19 fatalities since its outbreak emerged in February, the second highest toll in Europe after Britain’s."
16091,It has also registered 1.409 million cases.
16092,"While Italy’s daily death tolls have been the highest in Europe over recent days, the increase in hospital admissions and intensive care occupancy has slowed."

16096,"When Italy’s second wave of the epidemic was accelerating fast, until around a week ago, hospital admissions were rising by around 1,000 per day, while intensive care occupancy was increasing by about 100 per day."
16097,"The northern region of Lombardy, centred on Italy’s financial capital Milan, remained the hardest hit area on Sunday, reporting 5,094 new cases."
16098,"The southern region of Campania, which has only about 60% of Lombardy’s population, chalked up the second highest number of new cases, at 3,217.

16099,Thats a fair point.
16100,So.
16101,Bigger wave=deadlier?
16102,Wut?
16103,"Local friend-of-a-friend died due to an ""clotting disorder"" following a respiratory infection back around early May."
16104,"That was back when hospitals were first slammed and testing was woefully inadequate, and COVID wasn't widely recognized to be a clotting disorder."
16105,This is Florida.
16106,"They think "" its a hoax, and even if it isnt a hoax its my constitutional right to become infected, and potentially infect others, because no one can prove where or when ingot infected""."
16107,They dont care.
16108,It’s not about them dying it’s about them spreading it and killing others what don’t you get?
16109,This is the fucking problem.

16179,I don't rule anything in or out at this point and that to me is reasonable.
16180,"I certainly don't automatically believe a vaccine is in place on the back of an announcement relating to data that has not been verified by independent, authoritative people; and on the other hand I think it is a decent possibility at this stage and when/if the time comes it has been through a rigourous review, then I will take it seriously and do some digging on how vaccines work and what the risks are given the comparatively short time frame in terms of development/trials."
16181,"Believe me, I'm sick to the back teeth of this whole thing and there's no one who would more than me like a safe, effective vaccine to be in place so that we keep people alive and I can get on with my life."

16190,"Writing things like ""The pandemic actually started in Italy"" is just wrong."
16191,The immediate backlash from family is way more “real” to you than the death of someone you don’t even know.
16192,"“officially”, but likely 5-10x more"
16193,"Probably also doesn't help there were huge celebrations the last two weeks, and then people were canceling Thanksgiving acting like thousands of people in a crowd without masks aren't going to do anything."
16194,You just asking for it dude.
16195,Looks like you jumped the gun with your comment bud
16196,It’s not really a straightforward thing to measure.
16197,"Manhattan’s density is 69,467.5/sq mi, for example, and Seoul has no suburban equivalent of Staten Island to bring its average way down."
16198,"That said, Hong Kong is denser than Manhattan and is clearly doing better than the US."
16199,So is a lot of Taipei- seems like density’s pretty irrelevant
16200,That’s stupid.
16201,You don’t even know what you’re talking about.
16202,Q called he needs you to stop the steal.
16203,Orlando downtown is absurd too!
16204,France really has not handled this well
16205,"Yea just people trolling or bots or idiots, I’m not sure."
16206,It really sucks there’s no good site to get real news or just a place to go to ignore the news.
16207,Reddit used to be fun
16208,It will for you!
16209,Like that is so much different than going to work in the dark and coming home in the dark?
16210,"They do sell lights that help fight SAD (for natural vitamin d production), supplements can do it too."
16211,"I'd say ""how extraordinarily suicidal"" such a practice is, but given 2020, it's not extraordinary at all."
16212,and life will be back to normal with the vaccine 😂 this is going to take a long time.
16213,So many have developed trauma and stress that we can’t just reopen everything willy nilly once people get the shot.
16214,Some people need heavy counseling with what they have experienced this year and in the months to come.
16215,The responsibility should be on the bar owners moreso than the customers for allowing/not regulating this.
16216,But yeah both are the assholes here.
16217,Just avoid your local dollar store and understand that IKEA ships directly to your home.
16218,You'll be fine.
16219,Everywhere I move gets shit about corona lol
16220,lol wtf do you think herd immunity is
16221,It didn't.
16222,"If someone has the virus, when are they the most contagious ?"
16223,"Totally agree, humans are not fit for free will, the government has to take control of the people so they don’t pull shit like this."
16224,[this article explained it quite well](https://www.google.com/amp/s/theconversation.com/amp/morality-pills-may-be-the-uss-best-shot-at-ending-the-coronavirus-pandemic-according-to-one-ethicist-142601)
16225,&gt;This is my experience as well.
16226,People who live and interact within a highly educated bubble might not realize how many people avoid news and current events in general.
16227,This is so true.
16228,"A former co-worker of mine knew nothing about politics or current events, flat out said he actively avoids them and doesn't care because ""nothing will change anyway."""
16229,"I tried to explain why it's important to vote if nothing else, but he's purposefully shut himself off from all of it."
16230,"There will probably also be people who aren't worried about the vaccine itself, but don't trust their insurance company not to screw up the billing."
16231,"We have seen so many stories of ""free"" tests that end up costing hundreds or thousands of dollars..."
16232,"If there was a sign at the pharmacy that said *Get Your COVID-19 Vaccine, FREE With Most Insurance* I sure wouldn't trust it unless I had already received paperwork from my carrier."
16233,And even then I would worry about a surprise bill.
16234,I would imagine more than a few folks there are on the hoax train too.
16235,When I lived there i was privy to quite a few interesting conspiracy theories.
16236,They sell tin foil by the hat size.
16237,The nursing home was doing really well then one day on a face time call the attendant was helping him out with the mask on her chin.
16238,Then he tested positive soon after.
16239,On another call his nurse was helping him and we could see his door open; his nurse left the room and a lady in a wheelchair rolls by on oxygen.
16240,Just abominable protocols.
16241,These are all the same people that buy out all the tp and try to resell ps5s for 900$
16242,Nobody is blaming the virus.
16243,They're saying lockdowns exacerbated the situation.
16244,And yet none of them are dying
16245,As might you.
16246,One of the biggest things that makes me skeptical about it is...
16247,I tried to dig up as much about it as could..
16248,"They claimed it was vitamin E acetate in black market THC cartridges, but even the CDC info it says it’s inconclusive... but there were cases hospitalized that never use THC cartridges"
16249,&gt;the country that you hate gives you a job that forces you to stay?
16250,Well I'm an Actor and hollywood is here.
16251,It's not so much this shit hole country that's giving me a job as it is the movie industry.
16252,"&gt;Seriously if you hate it don't be a loser crapping on your country, go move."
16253,"""If you don't like it, move!"""
16254,"For now, no."
16255,But I'm perfectly content to shit on this shit hole country until: a.)
16256,"It's no longer a shit hole country, or; b.)"
16257,I can leave and only return to act.
16258,You know the groundwork for it has been around for a year right?
16259,Nobody ever said one country was better than another just that one has proportionally more entitled idiots such as you.
16260,"Based on my research, the virus takes nights and weekends off same as us humans so it's alright."
16261,The limiting factor with hospitals is really staff more than space.
16262,It's relatively straightforward to set up field hospitals but to less so to staff them.
16263,"You can move people in from other parts of the country or from other specialties to care for covid patients, but only to a point."
16264,"I see a lot of judging going on here, as usual."
16265,1 million people could be flying for a variety of reasons.
16266,"When you live in a country with approx 400 million people, that are bound to have needs....even during a pandemic...sometimes people require flight."
16267,"Mostly employment, but also ... medical treatments, death in family, life events, relocating can require boarding a plane."
16268,Not everyone has the luxury to put their life on hold and judging others decisionmaking by your own standards is a slippery slope.
16269,"I'll file your anecdote under all the other useless inane crap I've read today, thanks for posting though."
16270,[removed]
16271,[removed]
16272,"My in-laws, who are smart, educated, and generally socially responsible business owners (and democrats, FWIW), seem to have zero understanding of how this all works."
16273,Enjoy these anecdotes.
16274,"A couple of months ago, one of them finds out an employee with whom they were working in a small office that week had gotten sick."
16275,I suggested they get a test before coming to see us and the grandkids.
16276,&gt;Where do I get a test?
16277,I don't have any symptoms.
16278,I don't think I can get a test.
16279,"""Call your doctor,"" I said."
16280,"""Tell them you need a covid test."""
16281,&gt;The doctor's office isn't open on Fridays.
16282,I think we're okay.
16283,"""🤦🏽‍♂️""

They got tested though."
16284,Problem solved.
16285,"Then this week, they find out that my uncle is positive."
16286,He was at their house a few days ago.
16287,We've been debating getting together for Thanksgiving.
16288,"""You should get tested."
16289,Obviously.
16290,"I'm not bringing my family to see you if you don't."""
16291,&gt;Fiiiine.
16292,How do I do that?
16293,Where do I get tested?
16294,"""🤦🏽‍♂️""

They make an appointment to get a test with their doctor the next day."
16295,"A couple of hours before the appointment, the kids want to facetime with the grandparents."
16296,That's weird.
16297,Grandpa is wearing a sport jacket.
16298,"""Where are you guys?"
16299,"Are you at a restaurant?"""
16300,"&gt;Yeah, we figured we'd get dinner before we go get the test."
16301,"You never know, it might be our last chance to get out of the house for a while."
16302,"""🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️""



I know you guys read the news."
16303,None of this is new.
16304,None of this requires a medical degree to figure out.
16305,What is wrong with people when it's not willful defiance and political misinformation?
16306,"It's like they've been paying attention, but they simply are not understanding how any of this works."
16307,Also read it during quarantine!
16308,🤘🏼
16309,"that's why we allowed ""package stores"" to stay open as an essential business, even during lockdown periods."
16310,"For legit alcoholics who will get the DTs and die if they don't get their booze, that's the solution -- buy your booze, in private at a package store

But that's not what reopening bars is about."
16311,"That's about people who ""just have to go out &amp; be social"" and willing to pay 4x as much per beer or shot for the privilege, possibly after paying a cover charge just to walk in the door."
16312,"The pandemic has shown us how many of THOSE assholes are around, for sure"
16313,And I know some that wouldn't.
16314,"It's not a hot take or trying to stir controversy, just sayin."
16315,Not sure Biden is anti-bar-capacity-limit.

16357,"Yeah, they've been closing schools for at least a few years now."
16358,I think it may have less to do with voters actively trying to use the event to gain access to the school and more to do with that there may be an incident regarding the voting that now occurs on school property while children are present.
16359,There were no hazmat people here nor any free masks or sanitizer that I saw.
16360,You did get to keep the pen that they gave you to fill in the ballot.

16382,Yeah none of them do that though.
16383,They go out to eat at places (indoors) that are operating against orders.
16384,They then go to see my father in law who's definitely high risk.
16385,They justify it by saying such and such is overreacting to covid.
16386,It's selfishness and stupidity pure and simple.
16387,You don't have to take up an ICU bed to overwhelm a health system though.
16388,"They can still show up with shortness of breath or other symptoms to the ER, take hours to be evaluated and discharged home."
16389,Their room has to get decontaminated before the next one.

and how do you objectively say what is right or wrong"
16502,Stupid shit is the inability to understand the very definition of “long term effect” - maybe you forgot to tell me those people also felt 20 years younger after covid lol
16503,I hope you're right!
16504,Nice moving the goal posts.
16505,Were going INTO Thanksgiving week with at minimum 250k deaths and 12M cases.
16506,"The real death toll doesnt fully reap its cost until hospitals are over capacity, which guess what dingus, has a direct correlation with active cases."
16507,Again you look like you dont know what the fuck you're talking about.
16508,Go defend the shit republican ideology of work or die somewhere else.
16509,"Hey, I need to explain this to a lot of people, so can you refer me to the studies you mentioned :)"
16510,And even then it doesn’t seem to matter.
16511,Dad lives in Florida and is going to bars every night singing karaoke.
16512,"He got the virus 20 days ago, and couldn’t even stay quarantined for 5 days before inviting his GF over."
16513,"He’s still symptomatic but otherwise completely back to normal again, since it’s been over 14 days."
16514,"Its not just that you don't like it, in your own words you HATE it."
16515,As an actor you have one of the least difficult and most privileged jobs on earth but you have the nerve to HATE the country (the system and the taxpayer) who makes your job possible in the first place.
16516,Either get off your egocentric high horse and learn some humility or leave.
16517,"Honestly not sure how you can write that stuff without being ashamed of yourself, move to an actual shithole country instead of being safe and comfy in the first world and then see how much hate you can afford for your own country"

16519,We did minimal stuff early on.
16520,"But we were supposed to be getting better testing, contact tracing, and PPE in the meantime, none of which happened, so it was wasted."
16521,"Now because of that, it’s out of control, and we will be well on our way to over a million dead when this is over."

16525,Ask 5 people and you would probably get 5 different replies.

Skip most of the supermarket and only buy none processed foods, that you cook yourself."
16527,"Go back to seeing processed foods as a treat you have on the odd occasion, not everyday."

Don't eat for at least 14 hours a day

16532,Oh yeah the democrats want to take our guns because they ask us to wear a piece of cloth over our face holes.
16533,Makes sense.
16534,None of these anti-mask people are protesting wearing clothes which the government also makes them wear in public... kind of hypocritical if you ask me.
16535,They should all be protesting naked if they feel that strongly about being forced to wear articles of clothing lol
16536,"Forget Thailand, look at the difference between US/UK and the poorest African nations"
16537,"Eh, I'd be careful about saying uneducated."
16538,Many of them are educated but they have a fundamentally different view of government.
16539,Many people on reddit mistake a fundamental difference in world view with a lack of education.
16540,They're not the same.
16541,Many of the people do not view the government as a solution for problems and want as little government as possible.
16542,They fundamentally think it is not the government's place to provide food or medicine for people and that these functions should be handled by local communities.
16543,I don't know if it was explicitly said.
16544,But in Melbourne we had one of the strictest and longest lockdowns in the world.
16545,All liquor stores stayed open the whole time because they were considered essential.
16546,It's complicated.
16547,"The US is a big country and the numbers vary widely (although they are going up everywhere now, but are not necessarily high everywhere)."
16548,"Should people in NY or California completely halt their lives because people in Iowa can't wear a god damn mask (and unlike March, we have enough testing to know what's going on and where)?"
16549,"I mean one answer is yes, we all should until this virus is gone, but sadly we lack the leadership and the general societal will to do that."
16550,"I haven't gone anywhere in two weeks, and neither have my parents, all so we can have Thanksgiving together."
16551,"Should we not do that now because half the country are selfish, short-sighted idiots?"
16552,"I'm not flying, but I can't blame anyone for doing so if they're doing so carefully (wearing a good mask + goggles/face shield, not eating on the plane, quarantining, getting tested before seeing family, etc."
16553,).
16554,If it does become endemic then we deal with it AFTER vaccines have been distributed to the global population and herd immunity builds.
16555,Until then it's up to all of us to keep the spread down so that nurses like my wife don't have to deal with the selfish actions of assholes like you that only think about their world and nothing else.
16556,"I would pay money to have you brought on a tour to see young people fighting for their life, people being denied access due to overcapacity and unnecessary tragedy through the actions of those who don't care."
16557,"Maybe then you'll get it and realize hey, maybe I should sit this one out."
16558,"One of the issues is that, yes, some people will spread it, but many won't spread it nor contract it, and that will reinforce their belief that they are exceptional."

16656,There is a big difference between “you’re going to get sick and die” and “you can get sick and get others sick and potentially cause deaths”.
16657,The first statement is a false claim to spread panic.
16658,The second statement is factual and promotes mindfulness of our actions having consequences to those around us.
16659,And the reason why we don’t talk about long-term complication is simply because it’s too soon.
16660,"There have isolated cases of possible post-covid strokes, but certainly not enough to really connect the dots."
16661,"My point is that people are dying from this, even if more of them are elderly people."
16662,"And even then, they’re still people."
16663,They don’t deserve to get sick and die like that.
16664,My girlfriend works with covid pts as an ICU nurse.
16665,She’s experiences horrors these past 8 months that most people will never experience in their lifetime.
16666,All I’m asking from people is some more empathy and mindfulness.
16667,"Just because it hasn’t happened to you or anyone you know, doesn’t mean that someone out there isn’t suffering from this disease."
16668,And now it’s spreading like wildfire to the point that it may just hit home.
16669,Just wear a mask.
16670,And stay home for the holidays.
16671,Keep your distance from people.
16672,That’s it.
16673,"According to most studies, the day before symptom onset, or the day of symptom onset."
16674,The Diamond Princess study reported that infectiousness peaked 0.7 days prior to the onset of symptoms.
16675,Obviously those are estimates.

16689,A lack of empathy.

16722,"I got in several disputes with my mom's neighbors because I wouldn't let them in her house and required masks outdoors, but they were coming to check on her and bring her gifts."
16723,They are just really bad at risk assessment and this is coming with a mix of bad information.
16724,"Every movie with a happy ending teaches us that we're immortal, subconsciously they simply can't believe it."
16725,And with misinformation about what is effective it's too easy to disregard things that would require a change in habits.
16726,"Also keep in mind that some people don't care so much about risking their own lives (""I'd rather die than not be able to help my neighbors when they have a problem"") not realizing they could give it to those they care about."
16727,"They falsely believe they'd be able to tell if they or someone they know is sick, so why take l wear a mask when ""clearly"" they're safe."
16728,This is a classic example of: never attribute to malice what can be attributed to incompetence.

16849,Most people don't really understand *why* it's necessary for America to continue with the war machine.

16864,"&gt;Health experts continue to urge Americans not to travel and gather for Thanksgiving as a fall wave of the virus worsens across the country, with case counts nearing 200,000 a day."
16865,"&gt;In the past week, the new daily reported case counts in the United States spiked nearly 14 percent, according to data tracked by The Washington Post."
16866,"&gt;”If you look at the map of spread across the country, you can see the risk; it’s very visible."
16867,"And moving through airports or travel hubs, I think that will increase people’s risk,” Tom Inglesby, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said on “Fox News Sunday.” 
Even if they’re driving from point to point, unfortunately, we don’t know if we’re infected when we walk into a gathering.”

&gt;He referred to recent data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that said most infections are spread by people with no symptoms."
16868,"The CDC, during its first news briefing in months on Thursday, recommended against traveling and gathering for Thanksgiving and said people should instead celebrate in their own households."
16869,"&gt;”The message for everyone is: You can’t assume you don’t have the virus, and you can’t assume the people whose homes you’re about to enter don’t have the virus at this point in our pandemic,” Inglesby said."
16870,"&gt;For those who plan to travel and gather with others for the holiday, he recommended keeping gatherings small, spending as much time outdoors as possible if weather permits, keeping mealtimes short, wearing masks indoors and removing masks only while eating."

16881,What about having only 28 deaths?
16882,And now no community spread for nearly two weeks?
16883,You’re getting downvoted for claiming successful countries are somehow “mediocre” and “struggling”.
16884,Funny how the UK is counted as a separate thing and thereby non-Europe 😂
16885,Valid comparison dumbass.
16886,The disease did spread to other Chinese provinces.
16887,"However, by that stage the government and medical system knew what they were looking for and were able to get cases in the other provinces under control relatively quickly (the fact that varying degrees of lockdowns were imposed over more than half of the country helped immensely too)."
16888,We are purposefully doing a much longer trip than usual this year.
16889,"We usually go for 2 weeks, but this year we're going for all of December (and bringing our dog in case we decide to stay put for longer)."
16890,This gives us time to actually quarantine once we arrive (and follow the state's testing protocol).
16891,I agree with you that most people don't turn Thanksgiving into a long visit.

16900,China is not an exception over here.
16901,Their numbers are in line with everyone else's.
16902,"Also, best medical practice and clinical knowledge don't mean jack all if your hospitals are choked."
16903,Medical staff first because they are among the top spreaders and there are far less medical staff than chronically ill people.
16904,"Using the vaccine to stop the spread will be far more effective than simply giving it to the most vulnerable because in reality the most vulnerable people are not just the ones with chronic illness, but also the ones most likely to contract it."
16905,"SO if you need a nurse to help keep you alive on a regular basis you are very high risk to get it, as we've seen in nursing homes."
16906,"Those people aren't just spontaneously getting it because they are old, they medical staff is spread it into the nursing homes."
16907,With a limited amount of vaccines I think you save the most people by limiting the spread.
16908,"Some autoimmune patients need constant attention, but most do not and they are low risk for infection even if they are high risk for lethality."
16909,**There is two types of vulnerable here.

16917,* Homelessness and joblessness have been on the rise for a while but both haven't even spiked yet.
16918,As more people get sick and can transmit it more and more likely people will have to leave jobs due to a lack of sick leave and those who are already jobless will likely be evicted in the middle of a pandemic.

16947,"And, to give him his due, he doesn't just hammer the best v worst, he actually points out that the western countries he is criticizing could be twice or three times worse than the best and still have incredibly better results."
16948,"It might be surrounded by dubious cultural judgements, but the central point that the worst responses are \*orders of magnitude\* worse than the best seems pretty uncontroversial."
16949,But vaccination doesn’t start in April.
16950,Everyone expects it to start in December.
16951,"I get what you’re saying, I’m just not worried about it."
16952,Starting next month we’re *finally* going to be putting an opposing force out against the rising covid numbers.
16953,"Vietnam, a country of 95 million, has only 35 deaths."
16954,"China has had over 100 times that, and it’s not surprising considering they dealt with SARS, and that’s literally where it came from."
16955,"No worries, Bill gates himself would say he's not a scientist."
16956,Computer science is a subset of mathematics.
16957,Its pretty funny that this was even a question
16958,Basically everyone North of Australia has done well except for Indonesia and Malaysia.
16959,China is not the exception in our part of the world.
16960,"But you have to GET it, so that means vaccinating the spreaders will be the most effective strategy."
16961,"Like in a nursing home, old people aren't just high risk of death, but also high risk of infection regardless of outcome, because medical staff are bringing the virus in an out constantly."
16962,It's easier to vaccinate 30 nurses than 300 old people in that case.
16963,"I would focus on front-line and other industries spread the virus the most because the virus isn't that lethal, but it is highly infectious so the RO is where you will do the most damage to the virus, not lethality."

16968,"It's just that we have so many willfully ignorant people in this country, they need to see these headlines and maybe it will sink in."
16969,How many cases has Singapore had?
16970,"58,160

Most of those cases were in dormitories."
16971,"They had that many cases, because Singapore was oblivious to the fact that dormitories would be high risk."
16972,Its not something your average Singaporeans would boast about.
16973,This!
16974,"I assume more people travel during Christmas time than they do Thanksgiving,."
16975,Yeah we just sat back and did nothing except shut the borders.
16976,"It was a picnic so far, actually /s🙄"
16977,"I'm not saying that they don't have it under control now, I'm saying that you'd have to be truly naive to believe their numbers."
16978,"You're saying that a country that aggressively oppressed anyone who even mentioned the virus, tried to bury it and lied to the world was completely transparent with their death toll."
16979,"They were hit first internationally, had zero time to prepare, had health systems collapse in a city of millions, and have 4,600 deaths out of a population of over a billion."
16980,I just don't get this thinking.
16981,"I get views here are probably a little skewed due to the Chinese Communist Party's part-ownership of Reddit, but it's still astounding that people will rightly doubt the words coming from Western politicians, but blindly accept those of China."
16982,Facebook is 1000x more damaging than fox news.
16983,"I'll file this under, ""of fucking course they are""."

16988,Australia as a whole is about 10-15% Asian.
16989,The demographic is quite different from Europe and Americas.
16990,"Also, white Aussies are a lot of chill and understandable."
16991,We gonna go on lockdown cuz there's a pandemic?
16992,"Yeah alright, fair enough."
16993,No.
16994,We do tend to skew healthier though and less obesity.
16995,"Everyone I know is socializing less and it’s not bc people have moved what was outdoors, indoors (I’m in portland)."
16996,"It seems obvious AF that Covid is seasonal, but people keep trying to find some moral reason that everyone must have earned their Covid."
16997,New Zealand is a huge island?
16998,lol no.
16999,"And as per usual, belittle the efforts of both countries and make excuses."
17000,"You lot travelled around Europe for your summer holidays, spread the disease further."
17001,You haven’t even put the effort in
17002,[removed]
17003,"Yeah for nursing homes, but only because they are high risk of infections, not because they are high risk of lethality."
17004,This is because old people in nursing homes need nurses constantly and that spreads the disease all over the rather tight confines.
17005,However it's really the medical staff that's spreading the virus and vaccinating them to stop the spread will be more effective than trying to vaccinate the much larger number of highest risk people first.
17006,So really the big risk in nursing homes is still the medical staff not being vaccinated mostly.
17007,A nurse who’s travelling the country to spend time with the elderly.
17008,Fuck sake.
17009,There really is no hope for the Americans.
17010,If we talked about the amount of 9//11 style events that shook the nation but resulted in no action we'd be here all day.
17011,COVID is the biggest one but if bombings aren't a key strategy than we just ignore the problems.
17012,And Iran is culturally eastern but seems to have managed western style policies and results.
17013,[removed]
17014,My sister is a nurse who is traveling.
17015,And she is taking COVID seriously but is convinced by the study.
17016,So there’s already that sibling-pressure.
17017,"I’d drive if I could, but it’s a long drive and I have finals week like a day later (distant learning teacher)."
17018,There’s other things at play (personally) that I’m not wanting to disclose on Reddit.
17019,But I appreciate your advice.
17020,If I could take it I would.
17021,We are a profoundly stupid country.
17022,It's as simple as that.
17023,"This is going to be catastrophic for Americans, we just had our thanksgiving here in Canada a few weeks ago and the cases went up x4 even worse in some spots."
17024,We sort of had a handle on things here but I now understand how quickly it can turn south.
17025,Child-lock your parents Foxnews station with a random password*
17026,I always thought those stores were more busy early morning as contractors pick up last minute stuff before heading to jobs.
17027,Fauci is the only person right now trying to pilot the Titanic and keep it functional from the hull to the deck while everyone else is breaking shit so the ship crashes right into the iceberg faster.
17028,Dudes doing everything he can and so many *don't care.
17029,* It's the worst.
17030,What's most absurd is that the people who are encouraging the breaking know that COVID is a massive problem and hold power in some form.
17031,It's so much pointless death.
17032,"Worldometer reports 251,790 deaths out of 12,450,666 cases for a death rate of 2.15, but I'll go along with a death rate of 1% for the sake of argument since that is a death rate that the deniers always pull out of their asses."
17033,"Even half the actual death rate, 1%, 124,500 deaths, is too many."
17034,Well you sound like an atrocious person.
17035,"Yeah this was particularly jarring to me, if anything, states that follow the east asian development model (korea, japan, china, taiwan, vietnam, singapore) are dominated by technocratic decision making"
17036,"Dunno either, but this stuff has solidified my decision to move to another country once I get vaccinated."
17037,Fuck this shit hole.
17038,"My bf’s family is having a dinner with 5 different households, and a lot of them are at risk."
17039,"His sister also went to Las Vegas and Thanksgiving day will be exactly 2 weeks since she went, and parties left and right with her friends."
17040,But now they’re all PISSED at me because my bf and I decided to have our own thanksgiving by ourselves this year.
17041,My bf hasn’t been social distancing (goes to Jiu Jitsu and hangs out with friends) and I’d feel terrible if anything happened to his family.
17042,"But it’s like one thanksgiving, i don’t understand why they need to celebrate it this year out of all years."
17043,"Of course lockdowns become harder to enforce, especially with law enforcement or right-wing politicians claiming that it is a hoax."

17046,CCP bot!
17047,"Don't ever change, Reddit."
17048,Greece has less deaths per 1 million than the international average
17049,"I agree that the people at the highest risk to contract it should get it first, not the highest risk to die IF they contract it."
17050,That will stop the spread and lethality faster unless the vaccine also works to counter the disease early or something odd.
17051,"I mean if it can SAVE a dying person then sure use it, but high risk people are only high risk if the virus is being spread all over the place."
17052,"The spread is the risk, not so much the lethality and MOST hospitalized people don't die even if they do suffer."
17053,lol you’re really quoting some number from the “democracy index”.
17054,We're having a national Jim Jones moment.
17055,I wouldn’t bother tbh.
17056,It’s not worth the risk and guilt I would feel if I killed my gran.
17057,More than 2 person per 1 second.
17058,This is not Not funny.
17059,My Father lives alone now and has a lady friend who's careworker brings her by for dates.
17060,"She has 2 careworkers these days, and I've no idea what their bubbles are looking like."
17061,I had a stern conversation with my Father about waiting until January to see her.
17062,"He understands, but got pretty angry at me at the time, told me I was awful and negative, and hung up on me."
17063,It hurt.
17064,I also felt like a jerk as Dad's all alone now and I know that's tough.
17065,He called the next day.
17066,I reminded him that I loved him and was trying to look out for him.
17067,"He was quiet, then apologized and said he understood."
17068,I call him every day and am sure to drop everything when he calls to chat.
17069,"Loneliness is a hard thing, especially for older folks - just be sure to be there for your Dad, do some zoom calls, play online scrabble, even watch a tv show together over the phone, whatever you can do."

17071,Then concern ourselves with defeating Covid19.
17072,Kinda like when you're on an airplane that loses cabin pressure.
17073,"You out your mask on first, then help others."
17074,Gotta start somewhere.
17075,Anyone who would complain about a serious lockdown implemented by government has not been properly distancing themselves from others during the pandemic.
17076,"It takes strong leadership to do that, but in absence of strong leadership the people need to take accountability and get it done."
17077,"He puts it in an envelope, tapes it where it’s obvious and says for walmart associate."
17078,A couple wouldn’t take it at first though.
17079,One women jumped up and down though.
17080,"Theoretically speaking, the vaccine should not be contraindicated for nursing mothers."
17081,"Out of all the available vaccines (for other disease), the only ones that are contraindicated for nursing mothers are live attenuated virus vaccines."

And none of the Covid candidate vaccines fall in this category."
17083,"Pregnancy is a lot harder to sort out though, as there are many more possible mechanisms that could affect the developing fetus."
17084,"I'm hard pressed to think of anything that could go into breastmilk as a result of a vaccine that could harm the nursing baby, other than live virus."
17085,In jail makes sense because they are higher risk to get it.
17086,Smokers don't make sense at all.
17087,"Obese makes some sense, but that's like most people right off the bat and we don't have that many doses."
17088,I think using the vaccine to target the spread will be more effective than giving it to the most vulnerable.
17089,I mean theoretically you are correct and Luxembourg needs to do stuff but comparing those numbers to US numbers does not work at all.
17090,The equivalent of 4000 deaths in the US in Luxembourg is....8.
17091,Now 8 deaths per day is obviously bad but if you manage to just get a single death less per day you are already at the equivalent of only 3500.
17092,Those vast difference in population numbers just really screw with those statistics.
17093,The scary part is comparing those numbers with other european countries.
17094,While Luxembourg is smaller than a lot of them and thus has a higher population density there are a lot of countries with &lt;6 million people.
17095,For those we can somewhat correctly compare the statistics.
17096,"&gt; seriously considering telling them no

Considering?"
17097,The fuck?
17098,Tell them no already.
17099,"There is little to no pressure on the healthcare system, which is the only reason we were locking down was to flatten the curve so that in the process of achieving herd immunity, deaths due to hospital capacity didn't happen."
17100,The elderly and imuno compromised need to lock down as well as whomever they live with.
17101,Nobody else dies.
17102,The mortality rate has rapidly dropped because that's what viruses do.
17103,And if people are getting it and then immediately spreading it they are either the unluckiest people or they were already spreading it before
17104,Nobody knows much about mRNA vaccines?
17105,"You idiots don’t know anything about any vaccines other than whatever article you read says, so quit with stupid fucking comments."
17106,Next year there will be some families who sit around the table at Thanksgiving and give thanks for the sacrifice they made of not seeing each other for Thanksgiving in 2020.
17107,Other families will sit around the table next year at Thanksgiving and there will forever be empty seats at their table.
17108,New Zealand issued their mask mandate on August 25.
17109,Extremely late compared to most countries.
17110,A lot of countries already have
17111,"I think it should be people most likely to contract the virus vs most likely to die from it because lethality is low and rate of infection is high, so mathematically that makes more sense to me."
17112,They will be digging mass graves.
17113,Without a doubt.
17114,You can choose what to be a fan of or  not - but the science is pretty clear - the virus grows increasingly dangerous as the patient gets older.
17115,Doesn’t mean there is zero risk for anyone but vaccines need to be given in  some kind of order.
17116,"About a million years ago, when half of Australia was on fire at the start of the year, I saw a comment ""This might have been the worst fire season in 20 years."
17117,"But on the bright side, it will be the best fire season in the next 20 years"""
17118,"I would thinking targeting those that spread it would actually be more effective because lethality is kind of low and RO is kind of high, so you want to hit it in it's strength, which is it's infectiousness."
17119,People who interact with people a lot and spread the virus should be the top candidates for the fastest results.
17120,Are there any stats on instances of Covid being brought to USA via Mexico and Canada?
17121,I believe there's been restrictions in place on both borders for non-essential travel since March?
17122,"Without looking at stats, I'd assume most imported covid cases to USA would have come via air or sea, the same as Australia and NZ."
17123,The west is too busy worrying about *their freedom*.
17124,The hypocrisy lies in the majority wanting to sacrifice deaths for a simple concept of freedom.
17125,Thank you!
17126,Yeah totally.
17127,I have to travel this Christmas because my grandma is basically forcing us all with guilt.
17128,"I’m going double masked, gloved, and face shield."
17129,Our health care system will certainly collapse by the end of December.
17130,Until that negativity bias hits ya!
17131,Great movie!
17132,All I know is my gut says maybe.
17133,They could probably do 40 million people then come back for more vaccine.
17134,It could make a big difference if they do the most vunerable.
17135,"Yeah it totally seemed like I was correcting you, tbh I was going to edit it but I don’t even know how I would salvage that comment short of deleting it :D sorry lol"
17136,Interesting read a article summing it up.
17137,Might be correct.
17138,Seems the airs filtered every 2 minutes and particle size of Covid is larger enough for the filter.
17139,Also “The testing assumed only one infected person on the plane and did not simulate the effects of passenger movement around the cabin.” Still something to look at it though.
17140,The mistake was that they interviewed the bat in Mandarin.
17141,Bat couldn't understand.
17142,"Once we start speaking Italian, the bat confessed."
17143,A lot of people are about to kill their parents and grandparents.
17144,Just before the vaccine comes out.
17145,Fucking feels bad man.
17146,"I just wish we would take this shit seriously, the last thing I want is a rushed vaccine."
17147,Sadly that's gonna be our only option.
17148,Is FB the problem or just a mirror held up to our already selfish society?
17149,Have you been paying attention?
17150,That’s exactly what the government has been doing
17151,With luck it'll be twins and he can change it to fatherdozen!
17152,I think it’s more selfish than stupid.
17153,Sounds like *you* don't.
17154,"My workout is more intense, I assure you."
17155,Have Trump take the vaccine on live television and then inject it into Barron maybe then he can lead by example.
17156,"nope, can't do that, critical thinking is in my blood, and fyi, if it weren't for critical thinkers the world would've burned to ash a long long time ago lol and we wouldn't have things like computers, cars, planes, radios, telephones, defined laws of physics, and on and on and on...the world NEEDS critical thinkers...so again, no, sorry, can't stop being a critical thinker"
17157,"germany was a parliamentary democracy in name 

but hindenburg always held power."
17158,The army of weimar was thinly veiled as reformed but in reality was still the same Prussian militaristic army that existed before weimar.
17159,"I'm referring to hitler's germany in the 1930s you know, before he did all the gassing and holocausting."
17160,"We see facism for what it is now but, without the opportunity for historical hindsight, 1930s western democracies were stuck in economic depression and it seemed like the goddess fortuna favored italy, germany, japan, and soviet russia instead."
17161,"Surely that would be cemented as the western democracies failed to help the weaker members of their alliances Czechoslovakia, poland, etc."
17162,"It's different now but as australia falls under the influence of china, hong kong losing it's special status, etc."
17163,not by militaristic but by diplomatic and economic means.
17164,"You can see Hoovervilles popping up in many major american cities, san francisco, los angeles, san jose, and many other places."
17165,It's homeless camps and the streets are filled with crazy drug addicts where I live.
17166,It's reminiscent of history for me
17167,"Seeing as it was the OP agreeing with a theory, your question doesn't make sense."
17168,That's like asking someone to source an opinion that her neighbors' hosting block parties increases her odds of struggling to find parking space.
17169,"I’m still waiting for the shrew who tried to get us fined by the HOA for having a quarantine trailer in our driveway for a month after a known exposure...

We’ve since modified the basement to do such a task, with its own filtered ventilation system and some extra whole room HEPA air purifiers to help."
17170,But it blew my mind that the lady would yell at me for such a stupid thing.
17171,"&gt;Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,  

&gt;With conquering limbs astride from land to land;  

&gt;Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand  

&gt;A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame  

&gt;Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name  

&gt;Mother of Exiles."
17172,"From her beacon-hand  

&gt;Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command  

&gt;The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame."

&gt;With silent lips."
17174,"“Give me your tired, your poor,  

&gt;Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,

&gt;I lift my lamp beside the golden door!”  

-The New Colossus by Emma Lazarus."
17176,She wrote the poem in 1883 to raise money for the construction of a pedestal for the Statue of Liberty (Liberty Enlightening the World).
17177,"In 1903, the poem was cast onto a bronze plaque and mounted inside the pedestal's lower level."
17178,"I like to think that at the time, even her most fervent dreams for what the United States would come to be was eclipsed by the reality."
17179,I think the reason that there is so much discussion about America handling Covid is because so much of the world looks up to America.
17180,I'll leave this clip here from the intro to the Newsroom.
17181,I hope America comes out the other side of this pandemic and is reborn with new fervour for a better world.

17183,"Probably also ignoring the undercount, as well as incoming holiday season, winter and at least some local healthcare collapses

I'll take the over on this one."
17184,I always jump to Springfield Massachusetts.
17185,The basketball hall of fame is there.
17186,It's even worse than that.
17187,"Lawyers, lobbying groups, and special interests at least have some clue about what they want to achieve."
17188,The West is bluntly increasingly simply run by propagandists.
17189,That's why there is this widespread belief in Western governments - particularly at the highest levels of both politics and business - that you can simply PR problems away.
17190,This is also why they tend to assume that non-Western governments are also just trying to PR problems away instead of actually taking effective measures.
17191,"The problem really, is that contrary to all the toxic individualism talk, Westerners are actually very conformist people."
17192,That's why they are so easily fooled by PR and Facebook posts.
17193,"They are in fact desperate to ""fit in"" - hence so many deluding themselves into believing that not wearing masks makes you cool and patriotic, rather than a public health hazard."
17194,"I live in MA, which is regarded as the most educated state."
17195,"We have not had proper lockdowns, police don't enforce anything, people don't wear masks, people don't wear masks correctly, people don't social distance, people think the virus is a hoax, and people think any measures we do take are enough when it's clear they won't be enforced and thus mean nothing."
17196,"And that's all in just one city, there are multiple cities and towns in this state that are like this."
17197,"Education means nothing if the population chooses to ignore said education, and this pandemic proves education won't help."
17198,short memory i see
17199,"Reading this feels like reading a diary from a different century, not a country so culturally similar to mine."

17204,A correlation.
17205,Sadly no commercial pharma gain for further/fast investigation.
17206,"And the university's move slowly, as usual."
17207,"Yeah this is classic correlation, basically always is anytime that vit D is mentioned, and it has been proven countless times from vit D supplement follow up studies not doing anything."
17208,"Frail people have lower vit D counts and get sick more often, therefore vit D gets bundled in as a possible cure or preventative."

17218,Anti-maskers are afflicted with a mental illness.
17219,They must hear themselves talk.
17220,"They are afraid the mask will cause self harm, because it will push their mental illness to the breaking point."
17221,People who practice meditation are likely the antithesis of the anti-maskers.
17222,"You know, with things like this it’s easy to say just let them catch coronavirus and see God."
17223,But they end up infecting people outside of their congregation and it’s so fucked up.
17224,Yes but that is not the point he was making.
17225,"He was saying ""india is bad because they got xxx death"" which is an invalid argument."
17226,"If you want to say ""india is bad because their per capite death rate is high"" then sure, go for it."
17227,Our health department does them for free in a drive through type operation.
17228,"When your country has 10x the death rate of is immediate neighbors during a global pandemic, you have a pretty clear baseline of what you'd expect if you'd followed similar measures."
17229,"Sweden's approach has led to the needless deaths of roughly 6,000 citizens and counting."
17230,"Well, if there's only been 12.5m cases, and we only have a death rate of 1%; then how many will die if another ... oh, 300 million get infected?"
17231,"Yeah, 3 million."
17232,Let's hope even that is wrong.

17238,Oh we're believing Chinas numbers now????
17239,"for months we were told to be more like the UK and Europe, now that we're beating them by half almost half of their deaths the goal line was pulled back to competing with the numbers of China... that EVERYONE knows they are lying"
17240,A plushie?
17241,"A teddy bear, except in this case it's not a bear but a penguin?"
17242,It's illegal to deploy the military to police the US.
17243,"Also there are no official state border crossings, you can't just shut down every road that crosses state lines."
17244,Yeah nobody has to wait for that.
17245,"People are choosing to take a mild risk in order live their lives, like we do for a million other things daily, and it's not on 'epidemiologists' to tell everyone they have no right to see their family."

Exactly."
17247,Exactly my thoughts 😞😞
17248,"Yes, yes they will."
17249,Hate to see this.
17250,Small study but still disheartening.
17251,Looking out for further research
17252,Pretty sure if you compare per capita for countries like Thailand/Cambodia/Laos/Vietnam there would still be a huge disparity with most other countries in the world
17253,I'd honestly be shocked if we are out of lockdown by 2025.
17254,"I have almost zero faith in round one of vaccines being effective, along with overzealous governors wanting to continue lockdowns indefinitely."
17255,It's gonna get bad next summer.
17256,That’s dark asf
17257,At that point everyone will have it in like a year
17258,Thank you.

17260,"The work load, the deaths, and the deniers are a lot."
17261,"I do what I can to listen and lighten her load, snd even have her set up with a great therapist once a month since this started, but it’s still so much more than any one person should carry."

17271,Did you have a real information about COVID19 there?
17272,"About polution, mass destruction of country?"
17273,I think so no.
17274,"Yeah, bad things are all happening in 2020."
17275,My hometown 💔 both mine and my partner's families decided to cancel Thanksgiving because things are so bad there.
17276,"They didn't want us to travel, and told us many people are still not wearing masks."

17290,"It didn't work because of people like her, who are healthy and go all over the place with no precaution as if they're invincible and as if they might not become a vector."
17291,"&gt; ""we should have never started calling it social distancing."
17292,What we should have called it was physical distancing.

17295,"I live in Florida, and anyone who has ever been here is not shocked by Florida."
17296,Colorado really surprised me.
17297,I thought you guys were a beacon of sanity and science in the west.
17298,A lot of the spread in Florida is from private gatherings.
17299,People casually visiting one another’s homes.
17300,The vast majority of people in our large cities wear masks inside businesses.
17301,"But if people decide to get together.. well, there isn’t a lot the government can do about it, you know?"
17302,It’s up to the people.
17303,Stay safe!
17304,None of those would exist without ad-revenue.
17305,Follow the money.
17306,"Spread went to almost zero in many places in the northern hemisphere too in summer, and we were quick to assign those improvements to various mitigations."
17307,Closing borders or quarantining all international arrivals is also a luxury only a few remote countries can do.
17308,They may have done it right but that doesn’t mean Denmark or France could copy their success.
17309,Just throw em on the BBQ.

17311,As a teacher in a district with in-person students I am terrified about what will happen between Thanksgiving and Christmas.
17312,"Every year there is so much sickness after the kids travel the country and bring back bugs from everywhere, this year they will have COVID too."
17313,"We will have critically sick kids, plus chas for the kids forced to quarantine from exposure, and probably some kids dealing with disease and death in their families."
17314,"I know some of their families will still travel with COVID and knowingly spread  it because ""its not so bad""."
17315,It is s heartbreaking.
17316,Umm.. huh?
17317,Or sources maybe?
17318,You went a little sideways with that.
17319,"I've already read all that, I understand how it works, I just won't be taking it for at least 6 months until I've seen how others react."
17320,It is my choice and right to do this if I choose (which I do).
17321,"After that period, if everything looks fine, THEN I will take it, not before."
17322,Providing me with information that I have already read in a dozen other places isn't going to change my mind about using a basically untested vaccine the day it is released.
17323,But thanks for your input.
17324,Also draws a lot of ooohs and ahhhhs.
17325,Followed by a feeling of not being able to breathe.
17326,Ima travel to the fridge grab a beer then travel back to my computer to play more video games
17327,"Nah, we’ll probably lock down before then."
17328,Many schools won’t reopen after thanksgiving.
17329,You know how battlefield plans never survive contact with the enemy?
17330,"Well, coordinating federal action in the US is like that, and the populace is the enemy."
17331,"We talk a good game around preparedness, but I don't think we could collectively fight our way out of a wet paper sack at this point."
17332,We won’t see how bad it’ll be for a couple weeks.
17333,Christmas and New Years are going to be the absolute worst
17334,"You know that India is a part of Asia, right?"
17335,"My family can barely even get me to come by for the holidays before covid, and we live in the same city."
17336,If I had to travel?
17337,They’d never see me.
17338,Don't expect this to be accepted.
17339,Too much money at stake.
17340,"1 month later

It’s on 20k cases in a couple states."
17341,We’re doing fine!
17342,"5 years later

Help me please internet everyone I love is dead and I can’t breathe"
17343,"There’s also the people not going to hospitals because they’re afraid of contracting Covid, people not getting routine checkups, people not going to the dentist, and people literally getting turned away by hospitals because their issue has nothing to do with Covid."
17344,"We can see this is happening and we know this will hurt us, why aren’t we doing anything to fucking stop it?"
17345,Not sure why you're being downvoted.
17346,You're correct.
17347,Putting your faith in either side of an operating government to solve all your problems is a false dichotomy.
17348,"There are many problems and many solutions, but at the end of the day, they're being handled by humans."
17349,"Fallible, predictable humans."
17350,Humans who can be bought with money or votes or who can be blackmailed or controlled.
17351,The sooner we put Artificial General Intelligence in control the better.
17352,Either we have a beautiful utopia where all problems are solved and everyone is happy or the robots nuke us and everyone is ~~dead~~ happy.
17353,thank god you arent a doctor then
17354,Yes.
17355,"We made the stupid mistake of telling people what my wife does for a living, and are used to giving random rashes a once over at the community playground."
17356,"But this was different, so I did what I could to help with preventative medicine, hoping that these past few years would have given my family some rapport when it came to medical advice, and by keeping my neighbors healthy there would be less patients at our small hospital where my wife works."
17357,But people wouldn’t listen.
17358,"And while I feel bad for them, even if everything else was taken care of, there’s no treatments we can do from our house (one loon told me through the doorbell that she knew we had HCQ, we don’t, I asked my wife about getting it a while back as it seemed safe and she said it was safe but pointless), and the poor woman is already so worn down from these months of high stakes and ever changing medicine that there’s no way I’d be up for anyone but our closest friends getting a telephone consult."
17359,I’ve since put that same list on my door along with a note that we aren’t taking solicitation due to CoVID19.
17360,Wonder if it helps.
17361,It's been more of a mental test than anything for the last 8 months now.
17362,"I'm living in circumstances that I'm far from used to or enjoy but then I tell myself how much worse it could have been, especially when I replayed some Fallout 3 back in April."
17363,All of this can wait.
17364,I'm trying to make sure I survive to see these hobbies like travel again.
17365,And I want to see others survive it too.
17366,You make it sound like no big deal that people are nervous about taking it.
17367,"I take all my vaccines and am scared of Covid, but I am sure going to wait a few months to see how it goes for the first wave or two."
17368,This would be the fastest vaccine ever to market by a fair amount (as I understand it).
17369,They are skipping a whole shit ton of testing.
17370,A LOT of them are quitting.
17371,Like 700 or more are on strike.
17372,"Tbh, I’d refuse to help anyone who A- went to a party or B- were unmasked outside."
17373,"Kids, babies, teens with unmasked dick parents, old people... I’d serve them."
17374,"No, and some of these vaccines only require one dose (Johnson &amp; Johnson for ex)."
17375,Think of these others as requiring a two-part innoculation.
17376,We need to get vaccinated every year for flu because flu changes rapidly.
17377,"So far, it appears this virus does not."
17378,In no scenario would we need to be vaccinated more often than once a year.

18344,They’ve had so many experts come out and endorse the safety of the vaccine.
18345,They’ve done three phases of trials.
18346,I’m just genuinely curious what more they could do?
18347,It’s not like they’re just going “ 🤖 yes.
18348,It safe” they’ve lined out the science of how they created it and literally paused trials when there was *any* indication of any unsafe sides from it

18358,"The US, few of the states can be compared to Sweden or even Norway or Finland's geography and population density."
18359,And even in places it might be theoretically demographically similar for comparison... the major difference between Sweden and the US is that the outgoing political leader in the US doesn't appear to give a shit about actually providing leadership to reduce cases.

18361,"Where are the reality shows following individuals from diagnosis to eventual outcome, warts and all?"
18362,"Maybe video of a grandma fighting for breath, and eventually dying with her family unable to be near her might drive the point home to the significant percentage of the US population who are unable to show empathy if its not on TV."
18363,"It's not like the virus would spread at full speed until it hit some magic ""herd immunity"" number."
18364,Something like 30 or 40% immunity would have a *massive* effect on the R number (i.e.
18365,it would be reduced by 30-40%).
18366,"When combined with even the most basic social distancing measures, 50% immunity would easily bring it well below 1."
18367,"For the sake of comparison, most European countries were more-or-less open (with some mask-wearing) until a few weeks ago and the R didn't really get above 1.5 despite under 10% having antibodies."
18368,"Additionally, vaccinating the majority of old people would prevent most deaths even if the virus *was* spreading at full speed."

18375,"""a bit misleading"", that's you being polite here."
18376,This is something between complete bullshit and a blatant lie by the numbers you post.
18377,"About 30% of the ICU places are free, Covid patients are about 20% of the taken beds, and there is a good possibility of upscaling them."
18378,"Also the headline ""European countries believed"", I severely doubt any country neighboring Germany actually had in the plans just using the spare capacity of Germany, and everything will be fine, as the article implies."

18390,"Uh a lot of places are having to shut down again because we fucked up our response to this virus so horribly by not wearing masks, having huge protests and rallies, casting doubt on the legitimacy of the issue."
18391,If we had done what we needed to earlier on we wouldn’t have to shut down again.
18392,You need someone in government telling you what is and isn't responsible?
18393,Why don't you turn over and let them stomp on the other side of your face?

18396,"As soon as they get sick the police lock them in their house and since it's not real, they'll be fine."
18397,This isn’t surprising at all.
18398,This is exactly the outcome you should have when your country prioritizes wealth over health.
18399,Short term inconvenience for a long term gain is the exact formula you need for a healthy outcome.
18400,"However, that is the exact opposite you want for the economy."
18401,Early in the pandemic you could clearly see where the priority was given the narrative was “*should*” we lock down vs we *must* save the economy.
18402,The current situation is the result of that decision making.
18403,"Health, especially mental health, cannot be prioritized when the goal requires working and spending to lord over us all."
18404,"Ah okay, yeah, I was asking about the first reason lol."

18411,The only western nation that I have seen to not relax restrictions too quickly is Australia.
18412,"They had a second wave, even if it was isolated to only one state."
18413,"At its peak, they had over 700 daily cases."
18414,They then went under a hard lockdown and set a target of 5 daily cases on average (sustained over 2 weeks).
18415,When the figure did cross the threshold they delayed reopening by a couple of days because there was a potential source of outbreak that needed to be dealt with.
18416,"Now the state has gone three weeks since it’s last recorded case, and only one active case currently remains."
18417,The nation as a whole didn’t fuck around when it comes to the virus.
18418,Borders are still closed to non-citizens and they have a hotel quarantine programme instead of self-quarantine.
18419,"Just a couple days ago, another state shut down completely when they recorded 20 cases in a single day."
18420,All non-essential businesses (including takeaway and deliveries) were shut down and you’re prohibited from leaving your house.

18425,Nunavut territory in Canada went from the largest sovereign COVID free place to being worse off than the provinces that contain our densest cities in a week.
18426,Still not quite sure how it happened given there are no roads to the territory and no roads between populated areas.

18447,&gt; neither are reliable at all if you become infected after the test (which is what could have happened here).
18448,"I know what you were going for and I don't want to nitpick, but.. You can be infected, get a negative test before symptoms, and then start displaying them during the flight."
18449,This is most likely.
18450,Think the Hope case and how McDonald supposedly got infected.
18451,"She tested negative before boarding the plane, then started showing symptoms in the air."
18452,Agreed.
18453,Four times less likely means negative three times as likely.

18479,If it had a 5% mortality rate it would probably have killed fewer people outside of China and *maybe* Western Europe and New York.
18480,The thing that makes this virus such a huge global health threat is that the death rate is just low enough for a sizeable number of people to not take it seriously and for governments to prioritise the economy over eradication of the virus.
18481,"With a 5% death rate, you'd have seen absolutely mind-boggling deaths early on, followed by much stricter lockdowns from governments and much more widespread compliance from the public."

18492,"It's the same thing with the pandemic - a similar subset of the population that opposes gun reform opposed all public health measures and sabotaged any meaningful progress, and over time, most Americans collectively gave up as well."

18501,I traveled from Washington state to Arizona and got very ill there.
18502,I went to an urgent care and the test was negative.
18503,I felt worse and went to the er but I wasnt sick enough so the released me after doing a PCR.
18504,I was scheduled to fly back before the results would be back but I chose to drive instead.
18505,My husband wasnt happy about it but I refused to be an article on reddit.
18506,PCR was negative ultimately so I really did have pneumonia but there is no way they'd have let me on the plane hacking like I was.
18507,let's pretend it is 80@ 330 million is 264 million people infected and infections give robust immunity (a BIG if).

18548,What else may have happened in the time after that is more the question.
18549,"For example, say you were infected they day you tested negative."
18550,Then you could start to show symptoms in a few days.
18551,And I have had right-wingers explain to me how the rest of the world is insanely jealous of the US healthcare system and are desperate to switch to it.

18777,What I want to hear is any informed person explain how this data submission could pass authorization after a hypothetical three-day review and yet be found to suggest substantial net harm after this three-week review.
18778,This is the only way that a shorter review process could end up being a significant mistake.
18779,"Devil's advocating with some extremely unlikely possibilities:

(1) Maybe the vaccine has severe long-term side effects that will only appear months or years from now."
18780,"(2) Maybe the 20,000 or so vaccinated trial participants were all just lucky, and if we collected data on 20,000 more we'd find that several die of an unexplained illness after vaccination."
18781,"(The higher the number of deaths, the more vanishingly unlikely this is.)"
18782,"(3) Maybe the vaccine has immediate side effects that are so rare and mild that the FDA could miss them in a three-day review, but not so rare and mild as to elude a three-week review."
18783,"Case 1 is a disastrous error, but it can't be averted by a slightly longer review of existing data."
18784,Case 2 is at worst a minor error since the current safety record already proves the vaccine is safer than Covid (at least for the vulnerable populations first in line to be vaccinated).
18785,"And in Case 2 again, a longer review of the existing data wouldn't change anything."
18786,Case 3 isn't an error at all.
18787,"Nobody cares if your extended review finds that the vaccine induced (say) 10 minutes of hiccuping in 1 in 5,000 patients."

18825,"Taiwan is just an island and part of China, the ROC doesn't declare Taiwan to be independent, but claims to be the ruler of China itself."
18826,This distinction needs to be made because its covid-19 measures is consistent with other Chinese provinces which also experienced numerous cases but low death counts.

18963,There was a comment on here around that time when someone announced they pulled their kid from school and had two months of supplies saved up and it was their “go time.” That sent shivers up my spine reading it.
18964,I still wonder about that person from time to time...
18965,Yep.
18966,Hold our beer.
18967,USA!

18973,You've never seen this much winning.
18974,"So much winning, we'll get tired of it."
18975,&gt;“Yes.
18976,Yes.
18977,"Yes.” That was the response of John Bell, Regius Professor of Medicine at the University of Oxford, when asked whether we could be confident that life will be returning to normal by spring."
18978,"You could very realistically catch it while traveling to see them, and bring covid into your family's home."
18979,No?
18980,Can't have a second wave if the first one never ended
18981,This!
18982,People need help right now more than ever.
18983,We were driving around and when we cut through our small town there were hundreds if cars lined up.
18984,At the head of the line it was a food handout.
18985,The church running it said there were 4 others going on around town today and they all looked like this and most of the cars will be  turned away empty handed.
18986,We found 2 others and the line went for miles.
18987,Weren’t they going to do that anyways?
18988,In my county it’s had a mask mandate for as long as I can remember island it’s gone up at least 100% in 6 weeks
18989,"Yup, Georgian here!"
18990,"So many radio plays about how the Democrats are “evil” but only use the same words like “socialist, and take ur guns away” but the democrat radio just gives a more calming “we just want to help, give money to workers that have been swindled by big businesses”"
18991,You can’t kill stupid.
18992,Keep trying COVID
18993,Either he has been living in a cave for a few years or he is highly delusional.
18994,I have a local example of climate change.
18995,"I'm 41, and live as far south as you can in Canada."
18996,"When I was a kid we used to get some serious snow, every year 6-9 weeks of snow minimum, usually much more."
18997,Now we are lucky to get a week or two every once in a while.
18998,Climate change is the easiest to understand too.
18999,"CO2 absorbs heat at a higher rate than the usual atmospheric gases, this is a fact."
19000,It is also a fact that we are producing billions of tons of the stuff a year.
19001,How would that not have an effect on the environment again?
19002,4 people out of 304 possible people over 18 continuous hours of exposure is a hell of a good job of the filtration.
19003,The studies said that the re circulation through HEPA prevents the virus from travelling throughout the cabin but those sitting next to each other were still vulnerable.
19004,4 people out of around 250-300 is really really good considering you are inside and in close proximity for 18 hours.
19005,This particular flight is operated by a 777-200LR which for such a long flight typically carries around 304 max and in COVID around 200 expected.
19006,200 people being exposed to COVID for 18 hours and only having 4 catching it is a hell of testament to how little the virus can spread on a plane.
19007,In comparision you sitting in the same condition inside a resturaunt with face masks would see around 25-40 people infected from studies over that time frame.
19008,"Yeah but none of them have it, so..

19037,Not everyone can stay home and order or there’d be no one to put the orders together
19038,"There's no endemic deadly airborne virus without some sort of vaccine available, except for Covid 19, and soon that will have a vaccine too."
19039,"And if it were the case that there were some disease that could kill others because you wouldn't wear a mask that we couldn't treat or vaccinate against, then you will wear a fucking mask or you will rot in jail."
19040,What if both me and the people I will socialize with confirmed positive?
19041,Checkmate.
19042,That's a real covid party.

19044,How am I downplaying it at all?
19045,"Fuck man, go back and read my posts, your reaction to it is EXACTLY what I've been saying happens too often here."
19046,It more has to do with people get drunk as the night wears on and social distancing &amp; masks get forgotten.
19047,"All these measures are to discourage people gathering, but there are often unintended consequences that negate the intended effect."
19048,Like bars close at 10 so then people late night at a house party.
19049,"There's just no way to stop people from doing what they want, but governments are being forced to do something."
19050,1.
19051,"That says low risk not “absolutely safe”

2."
19052,"4 people infected during a 18 hour flight isn’t “mass infection” and you have to eat on a 18 hour flight, go to the bathroom, etc."
19053,I’d bet there was a lot of moments where people were within 6 feet of each other.
19054,"&gt;So it was a suggestion, not a mandate."
19055,"You can't just ""opt out"" of a mandate."
19056,It was much more than a suggestion.
19057,Try to spin it a little harder next time.
19058,"No free speech, no free press, no free elections, no right to assemble."

19102,Maybe that's how it should start being portrayed.
19103,Can you imagine the freakout the news and people would have over 10 planes crashing every day?
19104,"It's funny how you started off criticizing how the US failed to have further stimulus, now you're just criticizing stimulus as a transfer of wealth."
19105,&gt;You've insisted on seeing things at that level and to dishing out blame at that level.
19106,"Your ""high level"" idea of dishing out blame is to avoid doing it and just say ""the whole system is broken, who cares who did what!""."
19107,"That's utterly, utterly pointless, and a naked attempt at deflecting responsibility - especially when 1 party is saying ""We need more stimulus"" and the other is saying ""no we don't""."
19108,&gt;Disagreeing with you doesn't mean I don't follow America's politics.
19109,I didn't say it did.
19110,"The ignorance you've displayed however, does."
19111,"&gt;Like I said, even the bill that passed in May was deeply flawed and didn't address many issues."
19112,"It also has led to a massive transfer of wealth to a few hands

This for example illustrates your ignorance."
19113,You seem to be under the impression that the May bill we're discussing here was the stimulus package that was passed into law - it was not - that happened in April.
19114,"As I already explained to you it was rejected by the Senate, who did not want further Stimulus."
19115,It has not lead to any wealth transfer.
19116,&gt;yet you're applauding it as if it was some sort of achievement by your team.
19117,"No, I was pointing out that the House had passed additional stimulus bills after the first one, which were blocked by the Senate, contrary to your claim:

&gt;They delayed it for months and months up until the last minute

At some point you have become confused and lost the plot, and don't know what is being discussed here."
19118,All that is happening here is that you said something that was factually incorrect.
19119,I was correcting you.
19120,The house had passed additional stimulus bills after the initial one (which was in April).
19121,"&gt;You are too invested in the pageantry of american politics

I'm invested in facts."
19122,"You're invested in bullshit, and pretending that it's pointless to blame anyone specific, while you complain about the democrats."
19123,&gt;Denying good societal outcomes at the altar of the market is the desired outcome and the pageantry of American politics and the believers (like you) of this theatre are keeping it going.
19124,The hilarious thing is this is what 1 party wants.

19612,Seems doable in a week to me under the circumstances.

19658,Do any of these have or contains any penalties or language that the police can use to make an arrest for violating them?
19659,"If not, then the police are hamstrung, and they are just trying to proactively save themselves from a public beating by saying what they are able and/or are going to do."
19660,"A ""simple"" fix would be for the Governor and legislators, to add language to the orders that spells out that a violation is a misdemeanor or even felony crime and can result in fines up to $$ and jail time up to XX."
19661,"Do this and the police have something to work with that is both a chargeable and arrestable offence, and they can enforce things, using tickets and arrests, if the people won't comply with the legal order."
19662,"Most Health Department issues don't seem to become a Police Department issue until an actual Health Officer is involved, and is prevented from carrying out their legal mandate(s), then the issue becomes something about not allowing the Health Officer from carrying out their legal duties, which then tends to become a disorderly conduct charge/arrest."
19663,"But as I see/understand things, it takes something like this to cause an action to become something the police can enforce."
19664,"Just telling people to stay home or off the streets, without any enforcement power attached to it, is just a request, and only puts the police in a bad spot."
19665,"Arresting someone for disorderly conduct for or while not committing a crime or a reasonable belief that a crime will be committed, tends to end up costing the police force and the city/govt they work for big $$$ when it goes to court for false arrest, imprisonment and the like."
19666,"I do hope that California gets things under control, because it's looking like they are going to be taking back the #1 position from Texas for the most COVID-19 cases."
19667,Definitely not the kind of #1 that one tends to want to be associated with.

19670,"what annoys me is that it takes away from real criticism and just comes across as a dick stroking contest, the people that make unfounded claims like ""Anti-Intellectualism is baffling from Europe"" never admit they were wrong when proven otherwise either."

19672,"I always take it somewhat personally because I've honestly been called racial slurs more as a tourist in Europe than in my more than 25 years living in America, so the idea that Europe sees anti-intellectualism as ""baffling"" is fucking horseshit

19693,That was with insurance.
19694,Thankfully I fought and made several phone calls and got my insurance to pay.
19695,They were hoping I wouldn’t contest it and just pay up.
19696,On the flip side that ER doctor’s agency would not budge and reduce their price.

19709,This source is very bullshit and right wing.
19710,It cherry picks the evidence to suit the point.
19711,The reality right now is that Sweden is now forced to implement stricter measures due to rising deaths and cases.
19712,"You definitely get the feeling that there are a couple, maybe more, people in this sub that don’t want the pandemic to end."
19713,All you have to do is read stories posted about DR Fauci and if he says we are in for a couple of very rough months people praise him and say he’s following the science.
19714,The next day a story is posted and Fauci says we are back to normal by spring of 2021 and people say he’s an idiot and doubt what he’s saying.
19715,They were controlled by Trump.
19716,"They still are, unfortunately."
19717,I'm surprised more of our nurses and doctors haven't went on strike.
19718,Most people want to go back to work and hospitals just fill up.
19719,I would just go out on strike right now while the iron is hot.
19720,The frustrating part is that the people that need to see this aren’t the ones reading this.

20115,Huh.
20116,I had no idea.
20117,I’ve been doing back of napkin math using a lot of variables.
20118,You know you can also use google trends to spot what areas (states or cities) are going to pop in cases a few weeks or a month ahead of time?
20119,"Add these three to search: Covid testing, Covid symptoms, Covid test."
20120,"Play around with timelines, locations, etc."
20121,I like the to follow and document the past 7 day search and keep track and spot trends and areas that move up charts to know which areas are going to become hot in a few weeks — and which areas are experiencing huge virus spread.
20122,"Granted, it was much easier in the beginning and then a couple months ago... data is getting kinda jumbled because it’s spreading all over the place right now."

20194,So..the big plan was to take the risk out of the classroom and move into strangers homes.
20195,Beautiful.
20196,I have an elementary school age child.
20197,You know how many kids have tested positive for COVID-19 at my child’s school since they went back to school brick and mortar in the middle of September?
20198,2.
20199,"Due to the (surprising) diligence of the school administrators, teachers, principle, they have established a heck of a plan that requires the kids to stay in the same rooms, wear masks at all times, have staged lunches, school drop offs, etc."
20200,I have no reason to believe that what they’re doing isn’t working based upon my anecdotal experience.
20201,You want to know why a lot of my friends’ kids don’t go to school as the school has the option for virtual only as well?
20202,It’s because it’s easier on the parent.
20203,"No having to take the kid to school or pick them up, they can go on vacations in different parts of the state and do the virtual learning anywhere, the kid has more free time, etc."
20204,Some of the reasons they share are shameful as a parent.
20205,"So, why shut the bar and the restaurants and not the school?"
20206,You have the benefit of stopping where stupid patrons congregate and It’s less trickle down effect.
20207,"Shutting a bar or restaurant, while tragic for the employees for the bar and restaurant, just simply impacts less people."
20208,Closing one school in an impoverished area where all the parents work impacts potentially hundreds of people who now have to make a decision between literally eating or having a roof over their head or their child’s education/safety (I say safety because you can’t exactly leave a 7 or 8 year old at home alone).
20209,I found it fascinating when the schools in my county announced they were going virtual only and so many parents were happy about it at the end of August.
20210,"Literally 2 days later the school board announced the furloughing of the school nurses, janitors, police officers, and other non-union teaching staff."
20211,"Logically, if the school is closed, you don’t need the non-teaching staff."
20212,"The outrage, however, was tremendous."
20213,"I get it, we should be able to compensate these people."
20214,"But if we can’t compensate the landscapers who can’t stop working to keep their kids home or nurses, or grocery store employees, or waitresses, or a tremendous list of other jobs, how can we compensate the non-teaching school employees?"
20215,Just like anything else in this world where you have to make a choice between two bad decisions it is imperative to have a full understanding of the reaching consequences of these decisions prior to just blindly making those decisions.
20216,I have found going to grocery stores that open at 5AM is also good.
20217,Often the only one there.
20218,Australia doesn’t have 340 million people.
20219,The majority of Australia is the outback
20220,"Despite doing nothing we still aren't running out of ICU beds, at least not the way they did in some european countries, because despite reddits constant socialism trolling the US healthcare system is actually pretty good."
20221,I hope that makes you feel good about your life.

20505,"The literacy rate at time of ww2 was far ahead of usa, uk and ussr."
20506,They just ran out of men trying to fight war on 2 fronts.
20507,usa is still racist where germany put the past behind them and built a strong culture.
20508,"We have had a few positive cases at my place of employment (none since August) but thanks to our state being a hotbed of activity, people that were all ""masks don't work, this is fake"" are 180 turning into ""I refuse to come to work, it's not safe""."

20518,Noem is the grim reaper.
20519,Killing all her constituents with her rhetoric.
20520,"Dark soul, that one has."
20521,Asymptomatic rapid testing should not interfere with diagnostic PCR testing.

20528,"What you're doing isn't doing everything you can to mitigate spread, which would be you both staying put in Baltimore and NC respectively."
20529,"Is your dad really isolating for 2 weeks before coming to Baltimore, no trips outside the home, no grocery store, no anything?"
20530,Is he doing a one and done drive from NC to Baltimore directly?
20531,Have you been isolating for 2 weeks prior to when he comes?
20532,Tests do return false negatives much more than they return false positives.
20533,"This isn't super selfish, provided you're both taking the precautions you're stating and not half-assing it, as I suspect you might be."
20534,"And yes, it definitely is travel."
20535,Is your dad seeing you for Thanksgiving worth you or him possibly dying from COVID?
20536,"You say he needs to see you, if he's going to die without that then maybe it's an ok trade."
20537,You might also find it interesting that hospital in german is krankenhaus which is like house of the sick.
20538,maybe they'll wake up
20539,Do you honestly believe that people will do the right thing when they find out they're positive?

20543,Any idea why they're waiting 19 more days?
20544,That's not what harm reduction is.
20545,"Harm reduction is saying ""we know there is a group of the population who will see family no matter what, so what can we do if anything to mitigate that risky behavior""."
20546,Testing is guaranteed to catch at least some non-zero percentage of positive cases more than not testing.

20576,"I've read all sorts of theories about the percentage of cases being asymptomatic, from 20% to 30%, 40% and even up to 81%."
20577,In my country (Portugal) people who test very often (such as football players who have to test before every match) tend to get asymptomatic infections.
20578,"I was wondering whether the fact that they're testing so often just increases the chance of a false positive eventually happening rather than them being ""asymptomatic""."
20579,"I find this important since two reasons why people tend to get careless are the idea that ""mortality is very low"" together with ""most people don't even have symptoms"", which might both be wrong for this one reason."

20816,"We can either stay locked down because we can't seem to get everyone to take it seriously for a mere two weeks, or we can take our chances and go have fun."
20817,[removed]
20818,show me a picture where no one’s wearing masks at airports.
20819,God if Reddit isn’t a cesspool of misinformation lately.
20820,"Let's let the groceries slide, a family unit still needs all children not to go to school, or any outside activities and all parents to either work remote or not work."
20821,I wonder how many families using this approach are able to do that.
20822,"Aah, gotcha"

20829,Gross 👎
20830,Fine w me.
20831,We have a system of checks and balances here for a reason.
20832,I keep reading these articles and I’m dumbfounded by them.
20833,It’s cognitive dissonance.
20834,[removed]
20835,"Wisconsin here, business as usual with bars packed and rifle season started today so now we are flooded with Illinois hunters."
20836,"If it helps, Joplin just reinstated their mask mandate recently after a while of not having one."
20837,"[https://imgur.com/EdUKrzO](https://imgur.com/EdUKrzO)

i'll take my chances"
20838,Well said.
20839,I figure we're about halfway through this thing; in general terms.
20840,What's another eight months of mask wearing and being a little more isolated?
20841,"In terms of hardships that people have to endure now and again, I'll take this one without much complaint."
20842,"Oh come on, the whole “Americans are fatties who need McDonald’s” thing is irrelevant here."
20843,"Yes, there is a large calorie deficit between what we feed animals and what they feed us."
20844,"No, that is not the cause of food insecurity in the United States."
20845,You don’t need to throw every remotely possible argument into something to make the already popular point that America sucks.
20846,"Lots of countries eat a lot of meat, lots of countries employ the same factory farming methods we do, and lots of countries have a lot of suffering."
20847,"There are many irrelevant, false conclusions you can draw."
20848,Bless you.
20849,I need muh turkey damnit!
20850,Also accommodation bookings.
20851,I watched it the other day.
20852,One of the things that stuck out was the vaccination bracelets.
20853,"And we're at a ""who gets it first"" point right now."
20854,I’m looking forward to tweets by trump blaming Biden and how he did better and would be doing better if he was still president.
20855,The future is so predictable.
20856,"There are 3 billion journeys within China during CNY, a tiny minority go overseas but that number is probably smaller than the expats who go on holiday."
20857,Source: am expat who left China in January.
20858,"New Zealand is real serious about Covid and as the other person mentioned, forcing people to quarantine in a hotel."
20859,Plus they do serious testing to trace strains (forgive me if that's  the wrong word)  so they  know who got what from whom.
20860,"In the meantime, while some people may be quarantined, the rest of the country really is covid-free."
20861,People live like we did in 2019.
20862,I know this from frequent long calls with someone living there plus reading articles about NZ which that person confirms.
20863,My point is it’s laughable that USA has any real understanding of poverty.
20864,Yes this is the only way.
20865,Prepare for violence
20866,[removed]
20867,COVID rent protection.
20868,"That’s not deceptive at all, you’ve just proven to everyone who’s read this that you have poor reading skills."
20869,They said that the spread of COVID increased drastically because of Chinese New Year and that it would be much worse during Thanksgiving.
20870,Nowhere in this article did they EVER say that COVID was introduced into the us by Chinese New Year.
20871,THIS.
20872,"I know this comment will get buried, and that’s okay."
20873,I am an ER nurse.
20874,I used to *love* what I do.
20875,"Now I dread going to work every day because of the patients, and the patient load."
20876,I get purposely coughed on by deniers while they’re being tested for COVID.
20877,Then they scream at us for not allowing their entire family back into their room to visit.
20878,Nobody seems to know what medications they take (I’m honestly shocked that there aren’t more accidental overdoses).
20879,"They’ll give you one story on why they’re here, then give the doc a totally different story."
20880,"Then you have the fact that people are coming in sicker, and we have less nurses to take care of them."
20881,"Our boss told us that “we’re actually fully staffed right now!”, but then call every single day I’m (and my coworkers are) off asking for help...even though we’ve been mandated to pick up a minimum of 8 hours extra every two weeks, and were told that it may extend to “either 12 hours every two weeks, or an extra 8 hour shift every week”."
20882,"I can’t leave work at work because of this, because there’s not a single day that they’re not calling me asking to come in extra."
20883,Then you have patients screaming at us because of the wait times in the waiting room.
20884,"Sorry, let me just move this intubated/ventilated patient out to the waiting room so that *you* can get your hangnail checked out right away."
20885,"I’m trying so hard to keep my mental health together, but it’s almost impossible right now."
20886,I have wished for COVID just to have time off away from this hell.
20887,"I cry either on the way to or from work daily, because there are no “easy” shifts."
20888,"And anymore, I can’t stand being around people outside of work."
20889,Even my family.
20890,"I feel bad because I feel like I’m neglecting them emotionally, but I literally have no more emotion to give."
20891,"Back when the pandemic/shutdowns started, we were “heroes”, everybody and their brother were sending us food every day."
20892,We got “free” PTO time given to us to offset the fact that we were getting called off at least once every two weeks because patients *weren’t* coming to the ER.
20893,But that PTO time came at a much higher cost.
20894,The higher ups learned that we could do more with less...so that’s what we get now.
20895,And I’m tired.
20896,[removed]
20897,Once anyone can get it I don’t give a shit about herd immunity.
20898,If people don’t want to get and hospitals aren’t at risk it I’m not worried about their case numbers.
20899,cool guy alert
20900,It's very much a part of our *being* American.
20901,I suspect somebody overseas wouldn't really understand it very well....it isn't a holiday *for* most other nations.
20902,I know when I was working over in Japan they were really baffled by the whole concept of Thanksgiving.
20903,Everyone I’ve talked to is traveling to spend time with family or inviting family over.
20904,I don’t get it.
20905,You generalize much?
20906,That’s why racism is still alive btw.
20907,Even here with 100% mask compliance the amount of people wearing it under their nose is infuriating.
20908,We’re so screwed.
20909,Don’t they even give it a single thought?
20910,Do they they wearing the mask at all is like some sort of magical pendant?
20911,Let the far right do it to us*
20912,I’m just frustrated with Mike Parson for not taking this seriously.
20913,I’m frustrated that nearby towns like republic still haven’t put their own mask mandates in place.
20914,Cox had like 150 covid patients admitted on Friday.
20915,That’s pretty concerning for a hospital that typically budgets for 350-400 beds.
20916,Oh that sucks.
20917,"If I have to go anywhere these days I just drive, but if you have to go over an ocean that’s not an option."
20918,Didn't I hear scientists on TV saying immunity might only last a few months?
20919,"I really, truly wish he was."
20920,"He really doesn't seem to be, but I hope he pivots realizing how much of his voter base actually *want* someone like that rather than Republican Lite."
20921,Yeah Im guessing angry whiskey rant.
20922,"At least in China, only the government knew about it and citizens had no idea."
20923,"Here, everyone know but openly doesn’t give a fuck."
20924,"Lol, he’d be dumb stupid to try and pull anything into actual people forcing them to give up guns."
20925,Now buying them like Australia did could work.
20926,Instacart is much worse than just using a delivery or pickup option straight from the grocery store.
20927,Kroger has free pickup in my area.
20928,Bill Gates must control the weather in his tracking chips!!!!
20929,!
20930,95% will travel by car.
20931,I’m wondering how they estimate that.
20932,"Forgive me for thinking this way, but due to our population size I feel the only countries the USA can compare ourselves to for COVID is China, India and Indonesia."
20933,"It is easier managing an outbreak on a lesser population, especially in rich and developed countries serving only a few tens of millions of people."
20934,"The US could do a better job standing up to covid, but we don't have it easy despite being affluent."
20935,I guess we can just ignore all the executive orders from every level of government then.
20936,/s
20937,"Yeah, let's follow China's lead."
20938,They had less than 10K deaths /s
20939,Yet people come from all over the world to attend our universities.
20940,Insurance companies are obligated to pay for 100% treatment cost for covid
20941,I will be staying home.
20942,Yes.
20943,But you can be less fucked than others.
20944,Don’t re-invent the wheel.
20945,We did a 16week lockdown and still masks are mandatory.
20946,But my folks are packing the caravan are going on a Statewide holiday cause we’re 3weeks no new infection.
20947,"Make phone calls, stay home, wear masks if you do have to go out and know that you’re not killing those you love."
20948,Or yourself.
20949,You don’t need a government mandate.
20950,Just a brain.
20951,It works I promise you.
20952,Look at other countries.
20953,[removed]
20954,Yeah the people suggesting we stay locked down until we convince 90% of the antivaxxers... lol.
20955,"Once this is available to the public that’s 100% their problem, I’m going to the bars."
20956,Kinda like only having a 6 pack instead of a 12 pack before you hit the road.
20957,"This, my family will still click the travel stat because we’ll take a toll road to my parents but they have been in our bubble since April/May and we’re both staying careful."
20958,I still have a bone in turkey breast in my freezer just in case someone isn’t feeling good Thursday morning because we’ll call it off and I can thaw it in about 4 hours.
20959,"&gt; The American people are ~~victims~~ **co-conspirators** of the President's propaganda campaign

Stop letting over 70 million pieces of filth off the hook for their sins."
20960,"I can't believe this stupid headline, or trusting journalists ever again (this is not the first time)

China locks down city (*In Inner Mongolia, which Tianjin is NOT a part of*) and orders mass tests in Tianjin (*which is not locked down, if you read the article*)."
20961,I can.
20962,All I can remember was I hated life even more back then.
20963,"I'm not looking forwards to this being ""over""."
20964,Social distancing and wearing masks is one of the best things I've ever got to experience in society.
20965,I hate being in line at the store with people all up on my fucking ass.
20966,I hated folks being all up in my face trying to look deep into my eyes or talk to me randomly when I'm OBVIOUSLY minding my own business.
20967,We can certainly hope
20968,"Under optimal conditions, which are slowly vanishing"
20969,3rd?
20970,"We ain't even left the 1st wave yet

Edit: I'm talking about america, not all the other countries, sorry if you were talking about the rest of the world"
20971,"Well, Rome was originally a Republic before internal infighting sparked the transition to a much more authoritarian Empire."
20972,[I'm joking heheh](https://bryantanner.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/getting_in_line_india_04.jpg)
20973,"Just asked my girlfriend, who had covid and went to a super elite hospital system within a college system that would allow for research staff purely working as contact tracers, and no one even called her to find out who she interacted with."
20974,To review the studies presented.
20975,There is that much information.
20976,They usually take more time to review
20977,Fair enough.
20978,Though these are the decisions governments grapple with.
20979,How much death is acceptable?
20980,"I believe around 3 million people lost their jobs in Thailand, around 1 million in the tourist industry."
20981,"This government said zero death, and closed up."
20982,Which is an option.
20983,"I’m merely sounding this out though, I don’t really have a strong opinion on the matter."
20984,Though I would err towards the side that there was a better balance of risk to be struck.
20985,IMO closed borders for a country like Thailand with a zero tolerance approach does more harm to their population than good.
20986,"Their economy, including the informal economy, is believed to be up to 25-30% tourism."
20987,No winners in these situations really.
20988,I don’t admire any governments job.
20989,Definitely depends on where you are in are in Texas.
20990,In Dallas grocery stores I’ve been too about 98% of people have mask and in small towns it’s more like 28%
20991,True.
20992,It's going to be free
20993,Read the article.
20994,It literally says it right there.
20995,It’s necessary to go over all the data and then have the meeting about it on 12/10/2020
20996,You will be disappointed.
20997,LBJ's Great Society social welfare programs weren't completely gutted until Bill Clinton fully implemented neoliberal workfare programs in the 1990's.
20998,This country is going backwards.
20999,It may mutate
21000,Got to get a few more points on the board before 2020 is over.
21001,Thanks for the info.
21002,Everyone has gotten a crash course in FDA procedure this year lol.
21003,As if these ppl are testing
21004,Australia says hi
21005,Probably no need to apologise to the guy swearing at a bot.
21006,Good on you though.
21007,The left isn’t just as bad.
21008,"They are better, but it’s not by much."
21009,They think it’s a huge gap but it’s way closer than they would ever admit.
21010,Doordash is down
21011,Has California had better results than the rest of the US?
21012,[deleted]
21013,Maybe the bars went and got their food licenses to open as restaurants
21014,"Also, I don't think other countries would want us taking our covid cases to visit them :/ As much as we like to think we are the center of the planet, we are all part of one big global community."
21015,I assume if travel requires proof of covid vaccination then the science rejectors will eventually get on board
21016,100%.
21017,I am in Austin.
21018,We have a population that is happy to comply with the mandate.
21019,"In the last 9 months, I’ve seen TWO people in a store without a mask."
21020,Also unsurprisingly is the blueberry in the tomato juice (+45 Biden in Travis county/Austin.
21021,"Harris county/Houston is +13 for reference) 

Looking at Texas broken down by county, Austin is ‘lucky’ when you adjust for population for other metro areas."
21022,"Dallas county has about 2x population, yet 3.5x cases and 3x deaths."
21023,But it’s not luck.
21024,It’s not a shock that the only super-blue metro area in Texas is doing well.
21025,I go to SE Houston about once a month and the difference in mask culture is goddamn wild.
21026,"As in, there isn’t a mask culture."
21027,We still have pretty much no effective treatment for COVID-19.
21028,6 months from now is going to be pretty much the same
21029,They all did it without lying about numbers too.
21030,It's still in the vertical line phase.
21031,Thanos did nothing wrong.
21032,You get the point.
21033,No doubt.
21034,Remember when we were told in February to quarantine for 14 days?
21035,The anti-lockdown crowd doesn't realize restaurants can't get make money if 30% of people are sheltering....especially the upper middle class.
21036,We can deny the virus but then our hospitals get crowded.
21037,That makes people less likely to restaurant.
21038,And then we get both deaths and bad economy.
21039,And we still have to solve the virus problems.
21040,[deleted]
21041,Same.
21042,I went back to the school at the end of June to pick up things from my office and there was still a sign outside telling everyone to have a great spring break.
21043,It was unnerving.
21044,"You signed up for it, do it."
21045,It would be nice to know what chemicals the vaccine is made from.
21046,Can you quarantine after you fly and test again in that city?
21047,Can you drive there instead?
21048,"&gt;First treatment of any kind to have prospectively confirmed and statistically significant anti-viral activity against SARS-CoV-2

&gt;Authorized for recently diagnosed, mild to moderate COVID-19 in high-risk patients

&gt;Initial doses of REGEN-COV2 will be made available to approximately 300,000 patients, with no medication out-of-pocket costs, under U.S. government allocation program."
21049,I just wish we had more doses available!
21050,"It’s exciting news, but we’ll burn through that super fast."
21051,Also glad to see the medication cost will be taken care of.
21052,I know in the long run it doesn’t matter but my family and I are staying home for Thanksgiving.
21053,Gonna facetime relatives and eat dinner here.
21054,"You are absolutely right, especially since we're finding out pre-symptomatic people are the biggest spreaders."
21055,"I live in Key West, where our town is full of tourists not doing the right thing and our state and local government is doing nothing."
21056,I've got a bit of a negative exposure thing going on as tourism season heats up.
21057,"Locals are mostly cowering at home with the onslaught, yesterday our positivity rate was over 20%."
21058,"Oh, i see, they are pretty good i think, unbiased at most of times."
21059,Nah.
21060,They're just really really really dedicated because that's how much they want to bring down Trump or something.
21061,You can’t compare with Wuhan because the US strain (G614) is 10x more contagious.
21062,"Yea I think this is something that we can give Trump partial blame for, but the untouchable mind set doesn’t come exclusively from him."
21063,I can’t tell you how many times a person told me I didn’t need a condom when having sex with them.
21064,The majority of people  think nothing bad will happen to them.
21065,So?
21066,"Born babies are only alive because thier mothers feed them 

Whether their life is maintained artificially or naturally is irrelevant

All innocent human life matters"
21067,Kills a guy just heading to work at 4AM.
21068,Parents bail them out.
21069,This is America.
21070,crew members who were near them?
21071,15 minutes?
21072,what kind of flights are these?
21073,"seems like there's some strangeness there, I guess."
21074,"Even so, 5 people got it out of 21 cases."
21075,"I fight every day for people to simply wear their masks at work... Good luck, everyone."
21076,Just put a lockdown in place for thanksgiving.
21077,Haha!
21078,stop it!
21079,you’re killing me.
21080,Lol!
21081,And then who knows what'll be like after Christmas and New Years!
21082,Happy holidays!
21083,You sure sound like you're conflating protests and riots.
21084,You taking BLM protests or pro-Trump riots?
21085,I am going to guess you have never been poor in this country.
21086,America has never cared about poor people.
21087,They were NEVER going to do anything to help people that couldn't afford to stay home for months at a time.
21088,You realize they have Americans that don't believe CHILDREN SHOULD GET FREE LUNCH.
21089,Do you really think Americans were going to help people that lost their job?
21090,American culture worships the rich and looks down on the poor.
21091,Also has.
21092,Always will.
21093,https://www.indiatimes.com/technology/science-and-future/oxford-vaccine-covid-19-research-519303.html
21094,If not enough Americans take the vaccine we will not achieve herd immunity.
21095,As much as these people suck we need to convince as many people to take the vaccine as possible.
21096,You live on a goddamn island no shit you can fix it easily
21097,It's like that mutated grizzly bear from Annihilation luring you with the voice of a family member telling you about all the delicious food they're making for Thanksgiving dinner.
21098,&gt;you could not pay me 50 bucks an hour to enforce mask rules in the states...
21099,"Correct me if I am wrong, but thats a good way to get shot or stabbed no?"
21100,Depends on how polite you ask.
21101,"If your kind about it then we usually go with just a quick one-jab shanking, but if you're an annoying jerk about it we gonna cap you, and If you complain after the shanking or capping... that's when your real trouble starts."
21102,99+% survival rate...
21103,The economists told everyone that a virus out of control will do more damage to the economy than any lockdown I guess we are going to prove that.
21104,They also predicted that even after the virus is under control people will not resume their spending as it was before the pandemic.
21105,Looks like we are going to test that as well.
21106,How does that work during a code?
21107,Having one nurse?
21108,We have two and I feel like it’s sketchy
21109,Maybe for you
21110,"In Romania, we had a football team with 23 positive tests that turned out to be false-positives."
21111,So I guess a positive test isn't proof either.
21112,Or 23 of them for that matter.
21113,Maybe it depends on the lab that works the results?
21114,I have no clue really.
21115,A poorly done lockdown is probably worse than doing nothing.
21116,At least when nothing is done people don't get lulled into a false sense of security thinking what they are doing is safe since it's still open during the lockdown.
21117,This one is specifically referring to the one in Missouri.
21118,"Sorry, couldn't clarify in the title without breaking the rule regarding modifying the title to reflect the article."
21119,the atlantic had a great article about a ‘lagging cfr’ that is about 22 days and about 1.5-1.8%.
21120,look st it because you’re right on the money.
21121,"I find it hilarious that Trump blames China for not being able to contain the virus from spreading outside the country with more than 1 billion people, while he has failed to keep it out of the fucking White house."
21122,Y'all already have the government monitoring your cell phones.
21123,"They're not going to use it for corona, because even if they did - there's no point, covid is going to spread in the US regardless of the government knowing where you are."
21124,It took us about a month to convince our grandmother to cancel Thanksgiving to those of you who are still arguing to have thanks giving canceled with your families I wish you luck
21125,"&gt;Another complained about the difficulty in recruiting workers: “Labor, labor, labor; we need people,” the exec said."
21126,"“We are losing people and cannot find replacements.”

Correction, they are losing people they pay poverty wages and now expect someone else to risk their health for poverty wages."
21127,There are no places hiring near me.
21128,I see lots of Go ApPly At ThE GroCeRy StoRe comments.
21129,They are not hiring.
21130,People do not have the money to shop as much.
21131,"Also, those places don't pay enough to cover utilities let alone a rent/morgage."
21132,"&gt;“They’re looking for work, but they’re being highly selective,” Larrea said."
21133,“People are hesitant to put themselves at risk.
21134,"There’s too much at stake.”

I don't blame them."
21135,I also so tired of how poor people are treated in this country.
21136,We are expected to sacrifice everything.
21137,The majority of Americans view poor people as roaches.
21138,I have seen that attitude on this subreddit.
21139,Telling people to go work at a grocery store and that they are also selfish if they want to spend the holidays with family in the same breath.

21171,"You are extrapolating and conflating these increases in quality of life as impossibilities that rarely exist except in a couple places, when in reality, there are countries on all continents with better Healthcare systems and labor protections than America."
21172,"The truth is America fell behind, hard."
21173,We got complacent after ww2 and stopped our social programs as the cold War ramped up a war on communism.
21174,Since then we've committed endless buckets of money to war and dedicated less to our domestic issues.
21175,America produces enough food to feed the whole world.
21176,"I assure you, there is not a shortage of food."
21177,"We (mainly our livestock) eat it all though by ourselves, and we choose to have burgers and chicken tendies instead of food security for all."
21178,We made our bed and now we are sleeping in it hard with this coronavirus pandemic.
21179,America needed to issue a coordinated lock down of hotspots and contact tracing.
21180,America needed to let businesses close temporarily and pay all employees to stay home.
21181,We didn't do it.
21182,We sowed disinformation and politicized a disease.
21183,We stopped believing it was real because we had no choice but to go to work.
21184,And now... it spreads... this won't be the last disease... America can do better.
21185,It didn't make the difference everyone thinks it does.
21186,The Sydney-Melbourne air route was one of the most busy domestic routes in the world before and during the start of it.
21187,"Also when it takes root, doesn't matter if it's an island or not at this point."
21188,It happened in Victoria from just one quarantine hotel and a handful of staff leading to a major outbreak that peaked at over 700 new cases a day.
21189,That's how infective this thing is.
21190,Took a 4 month lockdown to get it to zero cases which it has been for about 22 days now.
21191,"Anyway, Vietnam is not an island, multiple land borders including an almost 1000 mile land border with China and they didn't have a single death until July 31st."
21192,Then their so-called second wave was crushed by them with only 35 deaths in total because they took the outbreak very seriously and closed down Da Nang where it was mainly located.
21193,"Collectively you’re fucking stupid :(

I know there are plenty of good people, but damn at the number of Trump/GOP supporters."
21194,There’s too many correlations between voting a certain way and other life choices.
21195,Good luck (un)USA
21196,This is a completely ridiculous point.
21197,"People should avoid traveling for thanksgiving obviously, there’s no debate there, but acting as if Covid-19 was going to infect any less than billions of people just because people visited family on holidays is completely dishonest."
21198,"These half-truth/half-lies are exactly why nobody can trust any media outlets anymore, and it’s how you end up with people who think masks don’t work at all/masks and social distancing will fix everything/Its all the president’s fault/covid is fake."
21199,God awful journalism.

21201,having the rmb as a base currency doesn't equate to 'running the world economy'.
21202,You claiming the USA is somehow some sort of magic ship that all boats follows is laughable - the ability to project power is great diminishing daily.
21203,China's nominal GDP is set to overtake the USA by 2025 and has already surpassed when you use PPP.
21204,"In foreign affairs, China has pursued pragmatic influence whilst the USA has been addicted to projecting force."
21205,But keep living in that fantasy.
21206,The emperor has been exposed as having insufficient clothing.
21207,"FYI, TB (tuberculosis) is not caused by viruses."
21208,It's caused by bacteria (**Mycobacterium tuberculosis**).
21209,"I mean, just looking at it logically, it seems like most spread comes from pre-symptomatic people."
21210,They don’t know they are infected and contagious until after they’ve already unknowingly infected other people.
21211,If it was as simple as “stay home if you’re sick” this virus wouldn’t be ripping across the globe.
21212,"Any reasonable person is going to stay home when they are with Covid, but the main problem is many have no idea they are."
21213,Rapid testing large percentages of people *could* save so many lives.
21214,"It’s a logistical nightmare and we barely have enough testing now, but it’s what really should have been happening for months now."
21215,Yes and no.
21216,I feel better knowing what we know about the virus but I feel like people are taking more risks every single day as we go on.
21217,"Of course your chances are better now that we know what we're dealing with but it's still not something you want to gamble with if you really didn't have to, know what I mean?"
21218,I'm not saying this is true but i just had this thought.
21219,Isn't Mitch a perfect excuse for the left to pretend that they've done their best to change something their base feels strongly about but the establishment does not really want.
21220,I just don't believe these old career politicians are enemies like they are portrayed to be in the media.
21221,No.
21222,Our country is full of people who can make their own choices and do as they please.
21223,Which is far more desirable than living in China.
21224,I think the problem is we have a culture war going on and those idols have largely lined up with the base.
21225,I do agree though if there were willing big names this would be an awesome way to share the message.
21226,"Australia also benefits from Christmas being in summer, and longer daylight in Winter."
21227,"The virus is spreading so rapidly because it is winter, really, and everyone has to cram indoors for all activities, plus the Christmas shopping season"
21228,Because people are fucking selfish
21229,Probably from rental car and plane ticket bookings.
21230,Most people planning to travel have likely already booked their tickets and reserved a rental car.
21231,Fuck that.
21232,Innocent people are dying and the burden is on the poor.

21236,How good is it?
21237,"It is not ""good"", it is normal."
21238,"You should expect the same from your leaders and if they don't provide it take their power away, by violence if necessary."
21239,"Any other course of action is normalisation of this horrible, unethical, immoral behaviour among your leaders."
21240,"or if the people vaccinated get sick between vaccinations, if enough of that happens it will be nightmare fuel for the antivaxers everywhere"

21246,Reno has plenty of deniers too.
21247,"I'm confused, why are reusable bags banned?"
21248,"Where I'm from they actually encourage them because of the environment, most of the supermarkets have warnings saying that if possible to bring your own bag and most people do it."
21249,You cant bring your bag and have to pay for the ones in the supermarket for what reason?

21252,"I have the slight feeling that some people want this to go on, because right now, everyone is miserable and sitting at home."
21253,A lot of people wallow in that collective miserableness.

21255,"And suddenly, those who still are miserable and still sit at home are responsible for their own life again."
21256,Flew today from MCO to IAD.
21257,MCO wasn't too bad and 99% were properly masked.
21258,1% were the idiots wearing N95 masks under their nose.

One thing I don't understand is why the airlines would offer refreshments."

21269,"Yeah, no thanks to your dumbass flying around to take a vacation."
21270,"As one commenter mentioned, Pfizer is moving to get placebo receivers to get vaccines as well."
21271,"In J&amp;J Janssen trial, they say we can leave the study anytime we want."
21272,"And we are free to get vaccinated if commercial vaccine is available, just to let them know so they can mark us as “exit from study”."
21273,One thing they discourage is to enter another COVID vaccine study.
21274,Flew today from MCO to IAD.

21280,Truly galaxy brain thinking.
21281,Can't have a 2nd wave if the first never ends.
21282,I was kinda hoping that people would be cautious this year but seeing as how business is as usual in the bakery I work at (totally slammed this week)I'm disappointed.

21290,"So many types of bread, and several brands of each."
21291,"Dozens of cereals, most were not around just ten years ago."
21292,We don't need thirty different kinds of Oreos.
21293,We don't need mountain dew flavored Doritos.
21294,So much food is thrown away simply because the store doesn't sell it.

21308,Funny how people still believe that it started spreading around February.
21309,It is well known that since November 2019 the virus started.
21310,Can you know realize how much people got infected/died/healed from the covid?
21311,"Regardless of how shitty our response has been, You can still blame the medieval country/culture that started the pandemic"

21316,"I wouldn’t say it’s failed all throughout the west, but it’s definitely still in progress and has dragged on due to the approach."
21317,But the chances of it being stemmed globally without a vaccine were near zero anyway in my opinion.

21363,Yeah vaccine documentation is already a key part of immigration/tourism policy from failed states in Australia - but there some are other considerations as well.

21438,"At about 212k it was already estimated the true number based on average deaths per year and how this year's has been so much higher, that 300k was already the real number."
21439,We're already approaching this figure if we take into account deaths that are unaccounted.
21440,By March we should be above this easily even with unconfirmed deaths.
21441,"Not all doctors are taking the virus seriously either, unfortunately."
21442,Could be worth a curbside pickup experience.

21446,No.
21447,If I decide to do what I want to do and you want to be safe all you have to do is stay in your house.
21448,Everyone out and about has made the conscious decision that they are ok with getting the virus.
21449,If you stay in your house you will be fine.
21450,The rest of us who have had it or those who haven’t can go on living their life.
21451,Your false moral high ground is idiotic.
21452,You should feel bad for trying to perpetuate that argument.
21453,Because the solution is you staying indoors.
21454,So do it.
21455,Stay indoors and shut up.
21456,I can’t spread it.

21487,"Just a nitpick: Singapore is more accurately described as an *illiberal democracy* (with a dominant-party), as we can freely elect our leaders but many of our freedoms and rights are more restricted than they are in liberal democracies."
21488,"Contrast that with pre-2019 Hong Kong, a *liberal authoritarian* country - China-backed lawmakers almost always held a majority, but freedoms like that of speech and assembly were less restricted than in Singapore."
21489,"Singapore has been in transition to a more liberal democracy ever since Mr Lee Kuan Yew's retirement, but his party is still dominant in the government, and is still well-respected by the people."
21490,"So the government is able to agree on laws/policies and enact them very quickly, which helped a lot with Covid-19."
21491,That's probably what people mean when they say Singapore is authoritarian.
21492,"(As an aside, this means the mainstream press isn't as polarised as it is in some Western democracies: *The Straits Times*, which has been accused of being biased towards the government, leans right (i.e."

*Channel NewsAsia* and *Mothership* are centrist)

21499,"IMO it was warranted, as the whole state has been living back pre 2020 normal since April so shit would have spread like wildfire if it got out."

21509,"Of the 1/15, some share of those either have symptoms or know they are positive, and are likely to stay home."

21669,americans are truly fkn dumb
21670,I agree on mixed messages.
21671,But not because working at target is okay but bars aren't.
21672,Every interaction you have with other people comes with a chance of spreading this.
21673,The goal is to reduce the risk of transmission as much as possible.
21674,To slow transmission down.
21675,"(If done effectively enough we would have already been past all of this)

People need groceries."
21676,They don't need alcohol and strange.
21677,"Wharehouses are reasonable, as they don't interact with the public and help the logistical network which is keeping us all from starving or being able to wipe our asses..."
21678,If we could close grocery stores and warehouses we would.
21679,"But, they're essential..."
21680,"The confusion, to me, is things like allowing restaurants but not bars."
21681,"Neither should be allowed, (and leases and utilities should be covered while their forced to stay to closed...)

21697,You got some proof of that?
21698,"How public outcry stopped Trump - the man who put children in cages and blackmailed Ukraine and fired the AG and played 2X the amount of golf as Obama, and who hired his son-in-law to do everything - how this man was stopped from banning all travel due to public outcry?"
21699,"&gt; Earliest confirmed case was on february 6th, ""community spread"" wasn't until March."
21700,Wrong.
21701,[First case in the USA was on January 20th](https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191).
21702,"First death from [community spread was on February 6th,](https://www.sfchronicle.com/health/article/First-known-U-S-coronavirus-death-occurred-on-15217316.php) indicating it's been spreading since early January."
21703,&gt;  since reality shows New Zealand was able to stamp it out.
21704,"This is called ""Post Hoc Ergo Promtpter Hoc"", as well as Begging the Claim."
21705,You have not proven that New Zealand stampted out the virus due to the travel restrictions; you merely say that's the case to claim another argument is false.
21706,"Furthermore, because the virus was reduced after travel restrictions doesn't mean those restrictions resulted in their win over the virus."
21707,"It's discounting the contact tracing, masks, lockdowns, and all the other efforts they used to beat the virus."
21708,&gt; They do not wear masks in New Zealand anymore.
21709,"Masks do not ""stop"" a virus."
21710,They can only slow it down.
21711,They don't wear them because they beat the virus.
21712,Your second point here is another Begging the Point; you imply that NZ is not wearing masks because masks don't work.
21713,Your third point contradicts the others; that slowing down the virus is not help in efforts to end the crisis.
21714,"&gt; EVEN IF we could control covid at this point, it's pointless to destroy the economy for it."
21715,Why?
21716,You are at highest risk if you are a) old or b) obese.
21717,A healthy 30 year old is not going to have a high chance of dying.
21718,You make a bad economic point and a bad moral point.
21719,"The economic point is that somehow our economy will be OK if 3 million people are die (1% of population), 30 million have permanent damage to their lungs and hearts, and people who work in food distribution and health care are the worst hit."
21720,That's a stupid argument on it's own.
21721,"The second point is both inadequate - people with diabetes, overweight, immune compromised, and have asthma together make up more than 30% of the population - and immoral."
21722,Your making a point that it's OK for *those* people to die.
21723,It's just those people.
21724,Sorry...
21725,I'm not a failed human.

21753,are't the Dakotas a lot worse than this though?
21754,so why is this so shocking?
21755,"in fact, given how things have been handled down there, why is ANY of it shocking anymore?"

21758,I just don’t see it in real life.
21759,Im a nurse on a covid unit.
21760,I personally know a hundred nurses and doctors and healthcare workers all over Florida.
21761,"I’ve never met nor heard of a healthcare worker, in real life, who is stressed out over covid."
21762,Definitely don’t know anybody who says they have “PTSD” over it.
21763,I think we are just happy to have a job.
21764,Exactly.
21765,It's fucking annoying because the rest of us have to deal with burden longer thanks to their lack of responsibility.
21766,"My uncle married a swede and despite congratulating me on my work creating r/Masks4All he still does not wear one in Sweden because he claims ""people are better at social distancing here""."
21767,I guess they’re just making people wait in ICUs for hours and sending people to other counties for treatment for the hell of it then?
21768,Keep in mind flu season has only just begun.
21769,"One difference, however, is that it’s not like travelers are spreading it from an affected area to an unaffected area."

21774,"I gave it to them, but I'm confused."
21775,"If it's free, why do they need to know that I'm insured?"
21776,"Is it because Covid is a pre-existing condition now, and insurers want to know whether my test comes back positive or not?"
21777,earth lol
21778,People are so dumb.
21779,America deserves this.
21780,That's a bit obscure!
21781,"l think the article is only referring to travel and the spread of corona virus within China, not how their authorities allowed people out into the rest of the world and spread it, then to threaten and cajole countries that threatened to barr entry from China."
21782,If you turn in 2000 car tickets you get the 6 foot teddy bear.
21783,Well said!
21784,Agreed on all counts.
21785,"&gt; If Sweden had followed their neighbors, they would have lost 567 Swedes at Norway's death rate of 56 per million vs their toll of 6,406 at 686 per million."
21786,Following Finland's example would have led to 688 deaths at a rate of 68 per million.
21787,"This really puts it into perspective, thank you."
21788,"Another argument I've seen made is that if Sweden has acted in solidarity with its neighbors, instead of cutting its own Quixotic path towards herd immunity via natural infection as the goal, the whole region would have done better overall."
21789,"This is because in Norway and Finland, many cases during their slowest periods were being traced back to Sweden."
21790,Do you have insight into that?
21791,"&gt;People who state that Sweden might still come out ahead are denying the reality

Could've stopped there!"
21792,"It's been really horrifying to watch this denialism of common sense, basic science set in in *Sweden* of all places (which before this I always looked up to as a place where science is taken seriously)."
21793,It never fails to shock and sadden me when I think about it.
21794,"That's not going to happen, and being stuck inside with a bunch of people and a lot of food?"
21795,You'll be lucky if they don't throw all of their masks in the trash.

21797,I told my boyfriend I'm skipping his mom's thanksgiving dinner.
21798,"I'd rather not show up and be wrong about catching Covid, than show up and be right."
21799,I did?
21800,"I cited the Italian study done by ""The Italian Association for Cancer Research"""
21801,Its crazy to think that China only had 4k deaths.
21802,Singapore is going on I think 11 days now with no local cases and only 28 deaths.
21803,Korea only has 500 deaths.
21804,How is that mediocre?
21805,"&gt; Oh no, you'll kill grandma... You must stay inside forever, you living your life is killing people."
21806,Direct quote.
21807,You sarcastically claim we need to stay inside forever or you’ll kill grandma.
21808,Implying you support opening things back up because who gives a shit if grandma dies.
21809,There is literally no other way to read that statement.
21810,Stop backtracking and get fucked.

21817,Someone in my neighborhood had over 10 cars over for an early thanksgiving even though the governor has an order of no gatherings over 10 people.
21818,"The police dept said to call the health dept, and the health dept was closed with a message to call police for health emergencies."
21819,We’re fucked.
21820,"Um, yea, because in the past they have infected the entire god damned planet by that point."
21821,This time a large portion of the worlds population has been able to distance from one another.
21822,I for one would rather avoid getting this since I'm at risk.
21823,"Honestly if I worked in an airport, I'm not sure I'd be satisfied with anything other than a respirator."
21824,I voted for Trump.
21825,I don’t think covid is as big a deal as this sub wants me to believe.
21826,"I don’t care if I get it, I have to work every day anyways."
21827,I live in deep rural Appalachia.
21828,My family cancelled thanksgiving.
21829,You can take your opinion and shove it.
21830,In the end it doesn't matter if you feel bad about doing it if the end result is you still travelling for the holidays.
21831,You'll simply be another potential spreader of the virus and the US is going get worse because of it.
21832,Heard this in Captain Kirk’s voice.

21834,Jesus Christ.
21835,Where did you hear this?
21836,That's awful.
21837,My parents are really lonely and have tried to guild me into visiting them.
21838,"They live on a farm and are very isolated, we are 3000+ miles away."
21839,"But, they are both high risk, and we are in a pandemic."
21840,"So because I love them so much, I’m not seeing them."
21841,"It hurts so much, they’re lovely people and I want my kids to know them."
21842,"But, it will have to wait for now."
21843,"""This does put a smile on my face."""
21844,"I'm in Western Australia and I remember back in April when we had our lockdown, my local community took it so seriously."
21845,"Like, my suburb's Facebook page was full of people talking about what we can do to entertain kids (one thing was that teddy bear hunt idea, where people hid bears in their front yard and families drove around for the kids to spot from their car)."
21846,"If someone popped up doubting the lockdown because they needed a haircut or their nails done, they were told in no uncertain terms why it was a bad idea and exactly why a lockdown is in fact necessary to flatten the curve."
21847,"We haven't had any community transmission in WA since June I believe, and while I give heaps of credit to our state government for getting on it so quick, and the fed government for approving supplementary payments so people could stay home from work, I also give much much credit to my fellow citizens."
21848,People took it seriously and banded together.
21849,It was really nice to see.
21850,"Don't get me wrong, it was fucking hard, but it helped having people online who understood and would offer support."
21851,"I’ve followed since Jan before the swap with the other sub, and wanted to echo this - everything you said was documented and they produced dozens of videos per day."
21852,I watched a lot of them and it was truly amazing to see the collective effort.
21853,Especially the volunteers.
21854,"And the drone videos of huge 20mil cities being completely deserted and dead, everyone at home."
21855,So is price markup
21856,As scared and sad as it makes me I'm assuming 400K by Christmas but to be honest I'm considering it might be closer to 500K.
21857,At that point we are probably heading into herd immunity.
21858,But the death toll is going to be staggering since our hospitals already can't deal with our case load imagine more than doubling it.
21859,At that point the US military will probably be activated and they will set up field hospitals at any place they can.
21860,we are talking every major stadium being converted into a field hospital.

21881,"Thanks for prolonging this shit though, so nice of you to  think of only yourself, as if you getting sick doesn't fuck over fuck everyone else around you."
21882,These orders are under emergency provisions given to the California governor.
21883,They have the force of law and must expire or be renewed in 60 days.
21884,I don’t think an individual can sign an executive order to overthrow the government under the powers given to the governor of California.
21885,I needed that laugh - thank you!
21886,A vaccine is coming in a few months and people can't fucking wait one freaking holiday.
21887,Ugh...
21888,Honestly I'm done with this country.
21889,I hate the people here so much now.
21890,It's gotten to a point where I need to constantly look over my shoulder and question is the person next to me is part of the half of Americans that truely are despicable people.
21891,I was at Costco today.
21892,Got to store 30 minutes past open.
21893,Couple pallet of paper towels gone before I could get to the isle (dumb ass store moved them to a different location) only managed to get tp which had maybe 40  bundles left.
21894,It was gone before I got checkout.
21895,"1) During recent non-panic times, I upped my supplies so I have 6 weeks of paper and cleaning supplies on hand."
21896,"I didn’t hoard, but I learned not to be close to running out."
21897,"JIC, not JIT."
21898,JIC = Just in Case.
21899,2) Supply chain is still messed up for some things.
21900,I ordered a refrigerator in May.
21901,Still haven’t gotten it.
21902,The store is now telling me “maybe 2nd week of December”.
21903,I don’t know details but I’m assuming at least some parts come from Asia.
21904,God can't help us if we are being egotistical.
21905,"Unfortunately, all I can hope for is for Americans to stay out of other countries and only travel within the US."
21906,I’ll mourn the innocent and condemn the guilty.
21907,We have plenty of resources to handle it
21908,"Vaccine is on the way, who gives a shit"
21909,"&gt;good gracious, they can eat and be healthy without working, because that's what a government should do."
21910,"It's strange for me, in usa, to think of gov't as anything but authoritarian."
21911,Covid is a serious problem for the world as a whole because of the danger it poses towards overwhelming the system.
21912,"Covid to an individual isn't a huge deal, especially when those individuals will receive the best care in the world, so the white house is probably pretty good with external threats that would pose an individual danger but didn't feel that this required them to deal with it."
21913,They can they but most retail companies are so afraid of angry customers they tell their employees to not confront customers.
21914,They know that anti-maskers are more likely to make a scene if confronted.
21915,Mask wearing customers won't make a scene about the anti-maskers.
21916,"But yes, they absolutely can and should confront people not following store policy."
21917,"Doesn't need to be germany, but there was a definite expectation that *someone* would have had the back of all those countries that suffered."

21920,Thank you!

21923,We are going to our dining room table.
21924,Believe?
21925,This is fact 15 is greater than 5.
21926,Your opinion on the matter is irrelevant.
21927,"""The average per-capita annual income in China is 30,000 yuan (USD 4,193), but there are over 600 million people whose monthly income is barely 1,000 yuan (USD 140), not enough to rent a room in the Chinese cities."""
21928,Enjoy having your hospitals overwhelmed I guess
21929,"If you have control of the disease then cases are in small numbers, and even smaller percentages of the population."
21930,So the absolute population size doesn't matter ... until you lose control and then its how bad it can get.
21931,"And don't forget, the bigger the gdp the bigger the ability to deal with it."
21932,The US should have it the easiest.
21933,"Be cautious, don't strike excess fear into others"
21934,Also mRna vaccine may become more viable in the future meaning future pandemics that happen can potentially get prevented faster.
21935,Aside from that tho we may some problems in the future such as climate change to possible world war
21936,50 million come on guys
21937,I can’t imagine everyone going on strike and not working in a hospital would be too good for patient health.
21938,Something about telling the patient good luck I’m going on strike wouldn’t sit well with people lol
21939,Jesus Christ.
21940,You need to stop getting all your news from Reddit.
21941,Crazy shit is happening all over Europe as we speak.
21942,America isn’t even near the top in deaths per capita.
21943,"Also, what the fuck does BLM have to do with Covid?"
21944,"I despise Trump more than anyone, but he has blessed the vaccine process."
21945,He’s not holding this up.
21946,"I hate to say this, but I think you just *despise* America."
21947,"That’s fine, but wear it, and don’t pretend like Europeans (50 separate countries) are some enlightened group who are lining up to get this vaccine and are significantly more enlightened than Americans."

21970,I seem to remember people talking about this Ben Gazi character....apparently he killed like 5 americans and was like the biggest evil do-er of all time?
21971,Wonder what those people think of this?
21972,I'm not sure we'll quite have the testing capacity to hit those numbers so it'll be time to watch the positivity rates.
21973,It’s a very small risk.
21974,MRNA medications and vaccine trials have been ongoing for years; there just haven’t been products approved and brought to market.
21975,But safety data is pretty robust.
21976,Source?
21977,"Um, look at all the hospitals that are saying they are near 100% capacity right now *before everyone travels*."
21978,Do you think Thanksgiving is going to make this magically go away and somehow less cases are going to show up next month?
21979,"For Pfizer it might have been 12+, but not certain:

21983,"Hell, i'm telling my Mom in the morning that first the first time in 23 years I won't be home for Christmas."
21984,A mix of not wanting to tempt fate with holiday rush airports and not wanting to take a month off work to quarantine in two separate states has made a hard decision easier.
21985,"I think the point he's making is that America flat out has plenty of food and isn't going to ""run out""."
21986,Which is pretty true.
21987,I mean go drive through the suburbs / county and see how many people DON'T have a garden?
21988,I'm in KY... heck we could have year round open season on deer for 3-4 years without really putting a dent into that population.

21990,Not a food production issue.
21991,So you have been out protesting heart disease and cancer?
21992,Have you been screaming at people as they eat a burger or use chemicals?
21993,Lots of fucking people die every month and you have 0 clue of it.
21994,With all these deaths... we will still have more people in the US in 2021 than we started 2020 with.

That's the whole point of a lockdown."
22072,You should just quote the entire comment because this guy is going to delete if he hasn’t already.
22073,Fucking embarrassing and extremely aggravating to see an example the people’s mindset that has fueled this fire.
22074,They will do anything to justify the garbage that comes out of their mouth.
22075,You could quote them directly as you just did and they’ll just delete it and act like it never happened.

22078,And yet it's the first time I've seen it.
22079,"Funny how the world doesn't revolve around just your eyes, Jackson."
22080,In philly yes...and paper towels and limits on amount if items like chicken or beef....augh...
22081,Yes my wife masks up in public and avoids public places as much as possible.
22082,"But then she thinks our families are totally safe to visit, that she can go have wine night at her friends house, do play dates with some other mom and their kids that they just met, etc."
22083,It's almost like her criteria for safety is that she knows their name.
22084,Fortunately she's agree to stay at home again with the governor's new recommendations
22085,How long to quarantine if exposed and testing negative?
22086,Family member was exposed to someone who has symptomatic the next day and tested positive the day after that.
22087,Today is the third day and she got tested.
22088,"She is getting another test Monday, day 5."
22089,She is quarantining.
22090,How long does she need to quarantine if she tests negative?
22091,"Oh no, no joke... You're just very angry man, hope you get help man."
22092,Honestly
22093,Nice straw man.
22094,How many vacation homes does he have again?
22095,Dishonest argumentation is worse than just being wrong.
22096,Asshole
22097,"Once again:

If you disregard rules and travel anyway, I have zero sympathy for you if you get sick and die."
22098,The people who I feel bad for are the people who did everything they could to prevent the spread and still got sick because of idiots like you.
22099,You can miss one Christmas and Thanksgiving with family.
22100,Things are truly insane right now.
22101,You can go to places you would think would be sparse of people and there seems to be more people than ever all around.
22102,Maybe I'm just noticing it more now but it seems impossible to find a place without random people milling about.
22103,Unless you pick it up while traveling and you’re in the incubation period when you test.
22104,Only accurate statements get downvoted on Reddit
22105,vt vt vt vt nomesayin'?
22106,Was crazy for me.
22107,Working in the television crew at a golf tournament.
22108,Everyone was already on edge...wondering if we were going to make it home or what?
22109,Fans were cancelled for 1 day...then the entire tournament the next day.
22110,I remember how frightened I was on that flight home.
22111,It truly was end-times.
22112,"Ironically, I was probably statistically much safer then, than I am now...but here I am - back traveling MORE than I ever have for work - THANKS INDUSTRY LAYOFFS!"
22113,Can you elaborate/point to a link?
22114,You're conveniently forgetting that a large portion of the workforce is casual and gets fuck all sick leave
22115,Because if people could just follow some simple guidelines it wouldn’t as risky to hop on a flight.
22116,"If they isolate for a few days and test negative, the risk is very low."
22117,"Not zero, but probably lower than the risk of getting in a car accident on the drive there."
22118,Everyone here needs to take a little chill pill.
22119,"I see that you need to get popped in the mouth, because you're a fucking jackass."
22120,You need to make sure your shoppers are taking precautions.
22121,I can't ficking count how many intsacart shoppers are not wearing masks.
22122,"Or wearing them improperly, or shopping for you with a crowd of friends."
22123,Be cautious.
22124,This subreddit is bogged down with doom and gloom type of people.
22125,There is plenty of good news to go around.
22126,I suggest taking some time and researching the positives about the pandemic to help ease your mind - there is a lot of it out there.
22127,"If you need to talk, or want some links to some better news, feel free to PM me."

22132,"Masks are a ""little inconvenience""."
22133,Social isolation is one of the biggest inconveniences there is and goes against humanity and how weve evolved throughout time.
22134,Definitely nothing little at all about thst
22135,There was totally a spike.
22136,Cases started going up pre July and then got even higher.
22137,It’s just not politically correct to state that fact here
22138,Nice.
22139,How do we know 50 million people will travel
22140,"His ""method"" is simply recalculating the number of deaths from cherrypicked western countries if they had the same deaths per million proportions of some cherrypicked Asian countries."
22141,"Following that is a long rant where he bashed the individualistic, money loving, technocratic west and contrasts it against some idealised far east that sounds like a socialist utopia."
22142,Something that is absurd to anyone that knows anything about Asian culture and politics.
22143,"Everything sounds extremely simple and easy, if only our leaders listened to a genius like him."
22144,"I say without hyperbole, this is one of the worst, lowest quality, most pointless things ever posted in this sub, even though competition is fierce."
22145,Most user comments here have more research and effort than this piece of garbage.
22146,The linked article isn't very good and comes to some incorrect conclusions.
22147,Being detected earlier in Italy means that there were available samples to study from that time period and someone thought to do it.
22148,Not that it's the only occurrence from September 2019.
22149,"Here is a reuters article that better explains it:

https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-italy-timing-idINKBN27V0KH

and here is the original article from Italy:

https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0300891620974755

If I remember correctly it's also assumed the virus was present in france earlier than detected because of someone reviewing lung x-rays from late 2019."
22150,It’s symbiotic
22151,How do you expect covid isolation units to function if any staff member exposed to covid can’t come to work?
22152,"Freedom of speech, combined with sufficient freedom from regulation lead to media run states."
22153,"Media that is naturally going to protect the interests of big business, being one themselves."
22154,"It does take more than the first to get here, although it's certainly a somewhat natural end to arrive at given enough time."
22155,"You can have for instance freedom of speech, and also a well funded pro-science pro-information public media spending, serving to inform the public."
22156,"Ofc, this is difficult to maintain because the money-that-be find it inconvenient to the narratives they want to sell."
22157,"Look at the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's decade of cuts and muzzles under the conservative govt there/(here, in my case)."
22158,But I still live in hope that one day we will understand again why those services were well funded in the first place.
22159,"more like 70% of trump voters are like that, and 40% of biden voters too"
22160,So they are still a success story in containing the virus.
22161,"No one said they are successful in hygiene overall, where is the mental gymnastic?"
22162,"so I don't see a source here, I assume you paraphrased it."
22163,I see that you graduated from a “child care facility” rather than a high school considering how ignorant your words are.
22164,I feel I'm in the minority on this; but I don't care where it came from.
22165,I'm interested in what species it hopped from and how to minimize the chance of future events; but for me Covid is out there.
22166,"Italy China, Alabama...."
22167,"Doesn't matter, it messed my life up the same regardless of origin."

22173,"We’re just able to confirm &amp; believe because multiple [experts] also were able to observe, record &amp; recreate the hint."
22174,"Same reason we know that bananas are yellow, almost everyone can confirm that bananas are generally yellow."
22175,"Same can be said for gravity, existence is confirmed by consistent results being observed."
22176,Big turkeys are not really in demand this year due to smaller gathering.
22177,Stores are trying to get rid of them.
22178,"I am, I’ve been isolated since March and it’s just not worth the risk to meet with family or friends."
22179,This years just going to be different.
22180,"And it’s absolutely not easy, it’s been so heavy for so long."
22181,I can keep going a little longer.
22182,"The exhausting part is knowing the live my life people, can’t be convinced that a little inconvenience on their end, goes a long way to help everyone."
22183,"So they just keep liven, being part of the problem not the solution."
22184,But some people cant live in isolation either.
22185,There is a lot of judgement on reddit for people who are just trying to stay alive mentally.
22186,Some people live alone.
22187,What are they supposed to do?
22188,It's been 9 months.
22189,That's a long time to completely be on their own with no form of emotional intimacy.
22190,And there is more and more evidence that zoom does not help for many people and in some cases make people feel even more alone.
22191,"It's a tricky situation, but I also feel blaming individual people isnt the answer."
22192,"We are telling people to cut themselves off from their support systems or they are selfish, and that is completely unfair."
22193,[removed]
22194,&gt;There’s also going to be that sense of complacency with how well the state did to suppress that cluster.
22195,"Where I live just started its second wave in the last few days, and the whole reason it started has traced back to complacency in the public."
22196,The headline alone gave me anxiety.
22197,Whew.
22198,It’s gonna be a rough couple of months.
22199,"Welcome to hell, USA."
22200,I think it skews both with age and obesity
22201,Question for anybody more educated than I: can this vaccine be trusted fully?
22202,"I’m a pro-vaxxer, but the fact that this one was put together so quickly, and (from what I can tell) hasn’t been studied enough to identify potential long-term side effects, is there any reason to worry here?"
22203,"Go
Australia 🇦🇺"
22204,Woooaah!
22205,The 'first thing' perspective is such a cool way to look at it.
22206,"No comrade, the virus has never been in China!"
22207,That is an American myth.
22208,It came from uh... ummm... Italy?
22209,All hail comrade Xi Jinping!
22210,Yah I am a RN on a covid unit.
22211,The quarantine rules don’t really work for us.
22212,We can’t quarantine when we are exposed because we are exposed every single day.
22213,All we do is get a temperature check when we enter the hospital.
22214,If we get covid we stay home until we test negative once.
22215,Then back we go.
22216,"But the senate has been very clear that relief will not be coming, and people just voted a month ago for a Republicans senate, knowing that means relief will not be coming."
22217,That means the two options are shutdown and starve to death or don’t.
22218,There is no third option.
22219,"When people say they want to lockdown, the “without any sort of relief” is the unsaid second part of that because we already know no relief will be provided."
22220,car=good
22221,"Nah, eugenics is selective and has a clear bias and goal."
22222,50% of everybody just makes real estate cheaper.
22223,covid is starting to hit my area but people are just saying 'well everyone had pre-existing conditions that caused their deaths' because it is mostly old people.
22224,"A lot of ""none of my friends have died so why do I care?"""
22225,while also claiming they are good empathic christians.
22226,"You don't think the inconsistent leadership, and 'back and forth' ""guidance"" hasn't played a role in what we're dealing with eight months later?"

22232,Sadly not in time for all the idiots travelling for Thanksgiving and Christmas...
22233,I hate this country and the people in it so much.
22234,Covid sucks...pre apocalypse era you could eat out of a garbage can and not care....nowadays people look at you like a savage.....fuck Covid
22235,I specifically work in Industry in submissions also (I actually started at Pfizer) and this is lightening speed review.
22236,"While I haven't worked specifically in vaccines, INDs (to start small scale in human trials) take 30 DAYS to review."

22242,$15 turkey checking in.
22243,"Staying home with my family unit, sorry relatives."
22244,Because restaurants are not serving people.
22245,"People generally eat 3 meals per day, and if they are not getting it at Mc Donalds, they are getting it at Walmart."
22246,"With this said, almost every grocery store has a very large labor pool available because of all the restaurant layoffs."
22247,"Bruh, there was a bill stalled in Congress before the election."
22248,Everyone was talking about it.
22249,Now republicans are drumming up fake election fraud claims to make it seem like nobody is talking about it.
22250,China may have mishandled a completely unexpected virus during peak flu season at the beginning but they were quick to stamp it down.
22251,The greatest nation on earth is still struggling after almost a year.
22252,"Agree, wear the mask, keep the distance."
22253,Here in SoCal you can’t go into any store or business without a mask.
22254,Because they lack common sense.
22255,"I hadn’t heard of that one but indeed there was another long haul flight in March with 13 cases, before masks were mandated."
22256,So that’s two flights out of millions.
22257,If flying were high risk there’d be hundreds of super spreading events on flights.
22258,A 0.25 rt in their study is incredibly low and that’s not even remotely worth arguing.
22259,"But it's normal for us to eat baby calves who have been caged so they can't move and grow muscles, to eat random chicken parts mashed into nugget form, whatever the fuck hot dogs are, to mash turtles and make soup out of them, and to use placenta for beauty products?"
22260,Every culture is different.
22261,You sound ignorant.
22262, Who gives a damn?
22263,"Doing research and finding earliest sources of the disease does not confirm a source or an origin, that’s bogus."
22264,"Also, I doubt China is actively trying to prove the virus originated with them."
22265,"We don’t know, truly, and we never will."
22266,Worst thing I've watched was that poor traveling nurse that left an El Paso hospital in the middle of the night.
22267,"She talked for an hour on a FB live stream about the ""pit"" were patients were just left to die."
22268,Young patients too.
22269,She was left because she was terrified  that if she got sick she would die in the pit.
22270,Horrible.

22272,"Its not like education goes bad, even if kids stayed home a school year and went back to it when it was safe they would still be ok."
22273,ESPECIALLY compared to the potential alternative.
22274,"Or, even if they don't learn *well* remotely it's not a complete waste."
22275,Okay I know this isn't super related to this particular thread.
22276,"And I KNOW cases are on the rise and that this is very serious, so I really hope this doesn't come off as me being a COVID skeptic here."
22277,But I'm seeing the headlines of us (the United States) hitting record number of new cases every day- are we also seeing record number of tests taken every day?
22278,Record number of negative results?
22279,"Again, I'm not disputing that this shit is wildly out of control over here and I'm masking up and being careful, but I'm also curious about the other numbers."
22280,I don't entirely disagree.
22281,Its hard to speculate but i also think the American psyche really loves am antagonist.
22282,"Trump could have spun this as ""we all must fight a common enemy oh and BTW it's all china's fault"" and that would certainly have made his cult behave differently at minimum..."

22285,"&gt;  we're in this together

Teacher, can I be in another group?"
22286,Never implied they are lining up.
22287,Just plainly stated that Americans are worse.
22288,"Don't get me wrong we have some pretty high heights, but also some really unexcusable lows for what we have access to as a whole."
22289,Just because european countries can sink low doesn't mean we aren't comparitively sinking lower.
22290,My primary news source is NPR.
22291,I read politico articles as well.
22292,Also like to listen to legal eagle's political commentary.
22293,"And due to my kentucky relatives toting the Blaze and Breitbart, I read that trash so I can try to understand where they are coming from."
22294,"Also I'm not sure if it's fair to claim despising Trump more than anyone unless you've been part of a demographic that he's sexually harassed, pushed off their land, threw paper towels at and then denied similar support to 'real parts of the US, approved stealing children from, condoned violence towards based on skin color, etc, etc."
22295,So maybe the angle I take is just off your radar?
22296,Apparently you can't see the broader implication of what I meant by 'categorical' in my prior post.
22297,I choose to believe you're smart and are just ignoring that.
22298,What's that thing quite a few european countries have again?
22299,Universal Healthcare?
22300,The bottom line matters and in the US we sweep our bottom line under the rug as best as possible.
22301,"So until the most needy in the US are treated properly, then yes, there is something wrong with our country."
22302,Just because I am at no real risk to covid doesn't mean that our impoverished black and latino community doesn't suffer worse from it than elsewhere in the world.
22303,I know I'm privileged.
22304,"I'm just also not blind to friends, family, and neighbors that have died, gotten evicted, and lost jobs and have tens of thousands in debt because they were just breaking even before."
22305,It is an obligation to look to see things that are going wrong for people in your immediate life and demand better and justice.
22306,You can't just point the finger elsewhere to justify what is happening at your doorstep.
22307,Bullshit!
22308,This is something that's perfectly easy to explain in binary terms!
22309,😂 yep you’re correct but I’d trust them more than Russia...
22310,"COVID came from china, and I speak out against china constantly, i fucking hate their government."
22311,"I don't hate their people, they have a rich culture and heritage."
22312,"In this instance i don't hate the US government, but there's a subset of your country that i actively fucking hate."
22313,"This selfish, self centered me me me fucking bullshit attitude."
22314,"Man honestly shout out to all the americans who pulling their weight but FUCK all these conspiracy toting, muh freedums loving fucks making the corona virus spread easy as fuck."

You could stay home."
22316,"I mean we’re in the middle of a pandemic, I got sick because someone at my partners work was irresponsible."

Ma’am clerks are fired for less than being rough with peoples groceries"
22321,Myself and my guests have completely quarantined for two weeks so we could do Thanksgiving.
22322,I cancelled it today - it's just not worth the risk.
22323,You can have holidays alone or funerals for family.
22324,Except mental health resources are missing as well since many clinics arent doing in person either and for many individuals teletherapy isnt effective at all.
22325,So their typical mental health support is also being closed off as well.
22326,Too bad welfare is a cuss word
22327,Not even close.

22348,go straight hazmat suit lol love it!
22349,"Yes, we should be more concerned about a variety of health issues."
22350,"But if someone eats crap and shortens their life by doing so, that doesn't directly put my health at risk."
22351,"Having millions of people who refuse to take a highly contagious virus seriously puts all of us at risk, and is hampering our economy."
22352,That's a far bigger impact than foreign-inspired terrorists have had here.
22353,Do they do that for obese people?
22354,Or alcoholics?
22355,Or drug addicts?
22356,Or unwanted pregnancies?
22357,Or chainsaw accidents?
22358,"Yea, your ignorance is showing."
22359,You have peak libRight thinking.

22361,Spend a buck feeding a kid in school so you don't have to spend 10 feeding them in prison.
22362,"Yeah, I have to admit I'm proud of her."
22363,The mental gymnastics is him trying to shift the US utter failure at handling Covid19 onto downplaying China's own handling of the virus.
22364,He was impeached.
22365,He just wasn't removed.
22366,"If you really want that ""traditional"" taste, you can get what I call ""turkey ham""."

22375,I’m just saying stop fucking eating for 3 hours on an airplane.
22376,I promise unless you have a medical condition you’ll live.
22377,Dude was also drinking a ton of booze so if he does have a medical condition I’d imagine alcohol is terrible for it.
22378,Iraq wasn't obvious.
22379,As someone who takes every precaution and is absolutely not trying to get this virus... Why the hell do some of you spend so much time in this fucking depressing hell hole of a subreddit?
22380,Well the word you say is basically just good health so yeah you’re right.
22381,It’s fuckin badass

22386,Doesn't mean that it's good.
22387,"We briefly entertained plans to visit family 600 miles away - with both families quarantining 2 weeks prior to the visit, driving 10 hours to visit with minimal stops, always masked when leaving the car and not seeing anyone else while visiting."
22388,"However, as the time to travel approached we felt increasingly anxious about the drive and possiblity for something to go wrong on the way there or home."
22389,"We cancelled about a month ago, even before cases were really spiking in our area."

22397,If airports shut down all commuter traffic and major highways blocked commuter traffic across state lines this shit would be a lot less worse.

22498,"That you should (again, not saying that you weren't necessarily) appreciate the fact that you're forcing other people to work for you while you stay safe in your home."
22499,"That you're in an incredibly privileged position to be able to do so, and not everyone can."
22500,&gt;The grocery store employees are going to be inside either way.
22501,"If everyone ordered pickup and it was just employees inside loading up bags full of food, the risk of exposure would just be from coworkers instead of the general public."
22502,DO you actually think it's posisble for every single person in your town to get efficient online ordering done?
22503,You can't be that naïve.
22504,"It was really hard and full of delays at the beginning of the year, and those places didn't even close fully."
22505,Imagine how horrid the experience would be if every single person in even a moderate sized town had to order online.
22506,"It's insane to think that would even be possible, logistically."
22507,And it's another thing that should illustrate just exactly the privleged position you find yourself in....that you assume online ordering and credit cards are so common you don't even give it a second thought.
22508,It's not possible for everyone  to go online and buy shit.
22509,"You can hold up in your house thinking about a fantasy world where everyone orders food online quickly, efficiently and the public doesn't have to come near a store employee....but that just isn't possible, and shows just how lucky you truly are."
22510,People are working in risky situations to serve you in order for you to not leave the house.

22519,The fear pornography here still has to persist as well!
22520,I am at wits end with all of this and now I am feeling all of this is about controlling people with those in power getting a thrill off of everyone's misery as these psychopathic leaders continually gas light the public and continue moving the goal posts.
22521,"Months ago, it was said that a vaccine would return things to normal."
22522,Now they are telling us we will have to continue with social distancing and all this crap for a long while after vaccine is available in spite of 2 vaccines being over 90% effective.
22523,This really irritates me and Ive about had it with all this!
22524,"Once many are vaccinated, they will live life as freely as was done before COVID I feel."
22525,I certainly will once being vaccinated and no one is going to interfere with that either no matter what position of authority they are in!

22533,But it's all the lit match's fault.
22534,Its going to be a shitshow in December.
22535,Pretty selfish of you to work while wanting others to stay at home.
22536,"Pretty selfish of you to work for an industry that is shuttling people around, presumably spreading covid at some point."
22537,"Pretty selfish of you not growing all of your own food, expecting people to run grocery stores on your behalf."

22542,Let's see how those thanksgiving speeches sound like in 2021...
22543,I really don’t get that level of not giving a fuck.
22544,It’s just such a blatant disregard of everything going on.
22545,"On the flip side, I took two weeks of vacation leading up to Thanksgiving to quarantine including taking a test this weekend to confirm I am negative (all just as precautions) so I could see my four family members for Thanksgiving, and my sibling cancelled it today because of the governors recent restrictions on businesses."
22546,Also not smart enough to understand the repercussions of actions but on the opposite side.
22547,Now I’ve used up my vacation time and still don’t get the mental health boost of spending some time with my family.
22548,"That's actually not an option for me, and that was the point of my comment."
22549,That I'm sad and angry and nothing can fix it.
22550,Most of the treatments being approved and that are approved right now are only for people with severe cases who are on the verge of being put in the ICU.
22551,"I don’t think there will be a magic pill you can take for mild cases anytime soon if ever, much like every other common cold virus."
22552,Which rule is that?
22553,That's kinda ridiculous.
22554,"But still, in general terms, where are we with treatment compared to vaccines?"
22555,Friend who works as a Physical Therapist (COVID stuff now obviously) told us yesterday that they had two ventilators left.
22556,So what?
22557,Statistically you could be one of the 50% and the only memory I'd have of you is this comment.
22558,"Shame, either way."
22559,I don't think that elementary aged kids are capable of fully understanding the situation.
22560,I also don't think they are mature enough to be able to remember it follow all the rules consistently.
22561,"It is difficult to see your kids struggle for sure and I understand most people, even if they work from home, can't take care of thier kids and work at the same time."
22562,With everyone having the same struggles right now I think collectively we can come up with some solutions.
22563,Which one is right?
22564,"Someone here said the other day, when you can’t process your own dead, you’re in a state of collapse."
22565,I think Texas qualifies.
22566,"When USA supermarket chains have a bag tax and then say that you can't bring reusable bags due to COVID, it's a profit decision, not a health one."
22567,Despicable corporate behaviour.

22573,That isn’t the problem.
22574,Most people won’t get sick.
22575,Most won’t need the hospital.
22576,But if you gather you are contributing to the chancel you might.
22577,Which is the real problem and could lead to hospitals filling up.
22578,"Ffs, people are still telling each other that 5% die?"
22579,CDC has had official survival rates of 99.7% - 99.8% up forever.
22580,I’ve read enough to know that you are on the fringe of the American political spectrum.
22581,Good luck to you.

22605,"There have been studies on this, children don't make up that gap."
22606,"I initially was all for keeping schools closed, then there more I learned and the research really supports trying to keep elementary kids in school."
22607,"Absolutely, *if* there's a great curriculum and *if* the teacher is fabulous and *if* the parents can be engaged...lots of *ifs* for that age group."
22608,"Older kids should be online only, it's too dangerous for staff I agree."
22609,"Oh boy, field hospitals sure sound fun."
22610,Maybe slightly better than dying in a hospital corridor.
22611,"Car company CEO says he crashed his car, so won’t wear seat belt."
22612,Lol travel where?
22613,How many countries even are open to Americans?
22614,It's because the producers consulted with the CDC for a realistic film
22615,Thanks for being sensible.
22616,Reddit seems to be under the illusion that being positive means that you’re not following the rules.
22617,"I’ve been following everything since March, and I intend to until we’re given the all-clear."
22618,But a little good news gives me the extra motivation to push on.
22619,I work in an insulation handling facility.
22620,Most of my coworkers are smokers and didn't wear masks before covid.
22621,They still don't.
22622,"Certain allergies (eggs) prevent you from getting vaccines, though I’m not sure that applies to the covid vaccines."
22623,Also autoimmune diseases or active cancer (because treating it wrecks your immune system) could prevent some people from being able to take a vaccine.
22624,Any previous negative interaction with a vaccine can also exclude someone from getting one.
22625,"I’m a RN, I screen people for vaccines when they are admitted"
22626,And here I am changing my gloves everytime I have to shift my mask lol (work in a deli)

22634,"They got rich and they're still in business, and now tweens are vaping as a prelude to smoking!"
22635,It's twenty fuckin twenty and we can't even agree that seat belts and ear protection are good things.
22636,Old people are more likely to die from 100s of other conditions rather than the meme virus.

22667,&gt;the Vietnamese militarization of COVID-19 messaging is only part of a wider goal to cultivate solidarity and a common identity.

22681,ICU nurse here.
22682,Our surge crisis action plan is 1 ICU nurse with 2 med surg nurses assisting taking 5+ ICU patients (that number gets bigger as unfathomable amounts of patients pour in after Thanksgiving).
22683,The ICU nurse functions to direct the med surg nurses (who have never worked in a critical care setting) in taking critically ill patients.
22684,"There’s many many many more med-surg/telemetry/oncology trained nurses than ICU nurses, so this is a way to make your ICU staff be spread thinner across the patients."
22685,"Imagine if even one of those patients coughs on their vent, takes too long to recover their oxygen afterwords, and crashes."
22686,"Imagine hitting the code blue button on the wall while three other codes are happening in the hospital already, and ten minutes pass while you are doing CPR and nobody has come running from across the hospital to help you save a life from fading away."
22687,"Imagine a doctor finally arriving to try just one or two Hail Mary attempts to save them, then calling time of death."
22688,Imagine having to bag someone without the respect their life deserved because there’s 20 patients in the ER waiting for the ICU bed that has suddenly just become available.
22689,This is where we will be before the end of the year in so many places across our country.
22690,THIS!
22691,how can a nurse be working in a medical job that’s equals biology and science to be spreading conspiracy theories.

22707,"I knew before Halloween that I wasn't going to do Thanksgiving, and the sane half of my family (the ones who would have actually hosted) agreed."
22708,"It's kind of a reverse ""The lord will come like a thief in the night"" situation."
22709,"Yeah, it won't last forever."
22710,But nobody will know the date that the virus is gone until that date has arrived and passed.
22711,There's just so much lag in the metrics.
22712,"""Indefinitely"" doesn't mean ""forever""."
22713,Totally!!
22714,Definitely religious on masking up and trying to keep my distance from people.
22715,"I am certain I got it at work from someone who came in my office hacking and sneezing everywhere and while she we waiting for me used my fucking desk phone, which I found out later."
22716,At first I thought it came from my husband but now I'm not so sure.
22717,"I asked her what she was doing at work with those symptoms (I work at a hospital in a paper pushing role and so does she, it's not like she needed to be there) and she said it was just her allergies!"
22718,I told her she should leave immediately and call our employee health dept and get tested.
22719,She refused and so I had to involve my boss.
22720,"She ended up testing positive,  I ended up testing positive, and the lady in the cubicle across from her also tested positive."
22721,This unfortunate cubicle mate of hers is still battling pneumonia and is living in a motel right now so she doesn't have to see her elderly husband who has congestive heart failure already and is on home oxygen.
22722,Getting this virus would probably kill him.
22723,"I'm sorry but I think people like that should get wrote up (the lady who came in my office, I mean) ."
22724,Each day we have to sign a form saying we don't have a fever or cough or sneezing or GI symptoms.
22725,She straight up lied on that form and now her cubicle mate can't even go home and has pneumonia.
22726,Why shouldn't she get busted for lying on the form she signed?
22727,My husband said if she really thought it was her allergies she shouldn't be penalized.
22728,"I don't buy that for a second because in this day and age no one knows if it is their allergies, strep,  a regular cold, or COVID."
22729,"I mean, that's kind of the point of why we can't come to work with any cold symptoms even if it's just a runny nose."
22730,"All this is to say that even being cautious and having the relative luxury of having my own office, I still got sick because someone else was careless."
22731,I should use this story for the people that want to come visit so they see how easy this is spread even after taking precautions.
22732,Nope.
22733,"As [one Swedish scientist said lately](https://www.pri.org/stories/2020-11-18/sweden-s-pivot-toward-new-virus-restrictions-may-not-shift-mindsets-says-swedish): 

&gt;We don't have any face mask recommendations in society at all."
22734,People can still gather en masse in malls.
22735,They're advised not to — but the prohibition is restricted to public gatherings.
22736,And that's not ...
22737,"I mean, the restaurants are still open."
22738,It's ridiculous.
22739,I decided I can’t handle all the winning anymore.
22740,My very unprofessional take is that there is a profound lack of respect for the elderly here.
22741,"If this was affecting those in their 40s-50s, there would be more action."
22742,Respect for the elderly is baked into East Asian culture.
22743,"In addition, all of east Asia as well as Vietnam are Confucian societies, in which there is a strong emphasis for both filial piety and respect for authority."
22744,"So regardless of the political structure, there is an inherent mindset of respect for authority."
22745,Whereas people are more cynical toward their leaders in the west.
22746,"Culture is thousands of years old and hard to shake, whereas the East Asian democracies mostly became democratic in the 1980s and after (save for Japan)."
22747,Almost there.
22748,"It's because Matt Pottinger, Deputy National Security Advisor who was in charge of the COVID response team from January to February before Pence's team took over, saw it as an opportunity to kick start Cold War 2.0 propaganda instead of actual policymaking that would have saved lives."
22749,That’s good to hear.
22750,I have friends who’s kids chose the full time virtual option and they say their kids like it as well.
22751,"I am sure there are plenty of success stories of kids where they have a good school program, an engaged teacher who provides structure and constantly engages, parents that can be present throughout the day to monitor and enforce discipline, and kids who actively want to make it work and be happy about it."
22752,"And coronavirus makes you lose your sense of smell, so we will all be good there."
22753,"It's going to be a question in the future I will use to quickly determine what kind of person you are - tell me about your 2020 experience, was it hard to quarantine for you?"
22754,Their answer will provide me with a lot of information about whether or not I want to continue the conversation.
22755,Yeah.
22756,Thanks China.
22757,Nobody could expect that 🙈
22758,Proper Fucked
22759,"Live in Shanghai, can confirm - no restrictions in most of the city outside of where the cases were found."
22760,"Definitely an increase in mask wearing everywhere in the city since the cases were found, though."
22761,I hope so because I want Anime Olympics 2020 Now 2021 to proceed.
22762,"same guess approx also, 400K by Xmas,"
22763,I don’t think we even have contact tracing in the us

22812,We're about to vastly increase the death toll to because of how much we absolutely need to hold a holiday where we celebrate how 'The pilgrims came to America and became besties with the native people and nothing bad ever happened as a result of this'.
22813,How about the governors and people trying to control everyone with their fear mongering let the GROWN ASS ADULTS make their own Grown ass decisions.

22824,"He's been sending me lots of pics of maskless hangouts with his other friends, so when he invited me to get food with him, I said I wasn't comfortable with it."
22825,"Then he told me that because he works in a tourism/service job and we live in an area that was an early hotspot, he probably already had it back in March so I was being unreasonable for worrying since he couldn't possibly get anyone sick."

23022,Any low skill job won't pay well because there are always people willing to do it as an entry level position.
23023,He's not.
23024,"40% of Australians live in two cities, Melbourne and Sydney."
23025,90% of the country lives in one of 18 cities/large towns (inc. Melbourne/Sydney).
23026,And we *still* had fuckwits who threw a shitfit about the lockdowns.
23027,I live in China and I remember how truly locked down we were.
23028,"They stopped inter-city travel, no public transport in or out, they even bulldozed roads leading in and out of  some towns."
23029,"My appartment complex in a gated community gave every household entry/exit cards, you were only allowed to leave your community once every two two days."
23030,January to April was a crazy time BUT it worked.
23031,"Everyone just kind of hunkered down, and though all the rules came from the government it was our neighbours enforcing them, we all kept each other in line."
23032,China shut down completely.
23033,Most business were closed for at least 3 months.
23034,"Now, it's as if there was never a pandemic."
23035,We all still wear masks on the metro and other public transport but life has pretty much gone back to normal.
23036,"&amp;#x200B;

In short, don't travel for Thanksgiving, wear a mask and try to avoid other people for as long as you can."
23037,"It sucks, but it will be better for everyone in the long run."
23038,"True, but from a US perspective, it's practically free."
23039,I wish masks were mandatory inside here in Sydney.
23040,Just been to the shops and it’s pre-christmas chaos and hardly any masks.
23041,"Come on, people, we’re not there yet"
23042,[deleted]
23043,"Also, at some point I expect medical staff to be so exhausted from this catastrophe and our unwillingness to take even the most basic of precautions, that we see a huge exodus from the profession."
23044,Countless tragedies in the making.
23045,Soon thousands of people will learn that their thanksgiving gathering has killed someone they loved by Xmas.
23046,Sigh.
23047,Ya.
23048,Freedoms duuummmb.
23049,Civil liberties and freedoms are more important than a pandemic
23050,Just saying this lines up pretty well with the study that about 93% of people develop immunity
23051,Whereas US states have mass cases and do nothing?
23052,Tell me who has better government?
23053,What are your parameters for “success”?
23054,"Good jobs, growing economy, guaranteed welfare in terms of food, housing, medical care, etc?"
23055,Anything else?
23056,Or do you just covet the right to vote for it’s own sake?
23057,The reason I ask is because it appears you are viewing political system in a vacuum.
23058,"The US has been successful in the last 100 years due to democracy, sure."
23059,"But also because it has a large labor market, was already the top economy prior to WWII, was economically innovative, had a fair legal system, and was not subject to invasion and ruin in WWII (or at any point in history, for that matter)."
23060,"It’s not helpful to analyze this in a vacuum because democracy is also responsible for the rise of people like Trump, Mussolini, and Hitler."
23061,Texas’ governor has $6 billion in stimulus funds that’s he’s sitting on and doing nothing with.
23062,"Maybe, maybe it wasn't a good idea to have a lockdown for 8 months."
23063,People would have taken these lockdowns more seriously if they were shorter.
23064,FYI in France scientists recently demonstrated rigorously that the lockdown and curfew measures had had absolutely no impact on the dynamic of the virus.
23065,The only thing which helped prevent spread was to enable mass testing early and isolate infected persons.
23066,Other studies are starting to appear on the collateral deaths that will result from widespread lockdowns.
23067,"Wouldn't that 231M figure be lower if you adjust for the people who gained immunity through a regular infection, especially for those infected in the Fall/Winter period—assuming vaccinations roll out by mid-Spring?"
23068,So it's estimated about 40% of the US population will get together over Thanksgiving with at least ten people.
23069,"If only ten percent of those people become infected we're looking at 13,200,000 new cases, and that's before they start infected others outside of their gatherings."
23070,Potentially doubling our total infected within one event?
23071,I'd say megafucked might even be putting it mildly.
23072,Totally concur.
23073,Posted this because anything seemingly positive about long term in relation to Covid seems outlawed.
23074,If you havent been watching your hospitals and the situation I can see how you would think that.
23075,"In the first wave when New York was having issues the rest of the country could help them, that can't happen anymore because all jurisdictions have runaway viral outbreak."
23076,All hospitals are reaching Peak capacity simultaneously while more than half the population is not adhering to social distancing or mask use going into a holiday.
23077,This is literally the worst case scenario.
23078,Australia has had the majority of the time this virus has been a threat being winter.
23079,"It still did better than the US, which had the benefit of summer."
23080,Lol no.

23095,"Hi all , i have a dumb question."
23096,So let’s say one tested positive.
23097,"With care and quarantine, the person is now tested negative."
23098,Does that mean the person is completely virus free?
23099,Or is there still residual COVID-19 virus left in body?
23100,I am just curious how virus works.
23101,Does the virus gets destroyed in body?
23102,Or the virus is just no longer transmitted to others?
23103,Thanks!
23104,And sorry for dumb question....
23105,So like.... are the mountain dew flavored Doritos a thing?
23106,Because I would try that
23107,"refuse to admit responsibility, refuse to process the trauma, refuse to make amends, wonder aloud why you're depressed and can't sleep for the next 40 years."
23108,Flight attendant asked me to pull up my mask as I was still chewing some of my own pretzels so as most things.... there are going to be good apples and bad apples.
23109,It’s been such a slow motion catastrophe that it’s really hard to watch.
23110,I saw a cashier at the grocery story pull his mask down to lick his fingers to separate some plastic bags while he helped bag groceries.
23111,"I think his customer noticed because when he tried to hand her a receipt after, she just stared at him for a moment before taking it by a tiny corner."
23112,And then he still had to ring up other people and touch their things too!
23113,Gross.
23114,People like this are why i'm still wiping down my groceries.
23115,'Merica
23116,America about to get Thanosed by coronavirus
23117,I would like you to be my mentat from here on out.
23118,People like who?
23119,"I wear a mask whenever I go out in public, as does my community."
23120,But we're still spiking... You people just can't admit that maybe none of this shit fucking works
23121,"Dude idk why you're being down voted, you're bang on..."
23122,I watched it three or four weeks ago.
23123,It was sobering.
23124,"The bit I found hardest (no spoilers) is the way in airport and street scenes, no-one was wearing a mask."
23125,It just looked.... wrong...
23126,It happened because the government was useful enough to react to the data.
23127,The US tends not to have that benefit.
23128,Ok - I hope you feel better now lol
23129,"Car tickets, duh."
23130,I'm not sure the alternative is better.
23131,Leave the borders open for tourism and you just delay the eventual lockdown and guarantee you have a domestic epidemic to go with it when you eventually do a few months later.
23132,"One that you then likely can't get rid of, as they actually have, it is actually eradicated here domestically which means you don't *need* internal restrictions any more (there are still commonsense precautions like masks in malls and public transport, and people don't complain about that.)"
23133,"I don't see the scenario in which tourism is maintained, on an ongoing basis, AND the virus is contained also."
23134,"Where you don't eventually end up in a lockdown scenario anyway, just with far more virus and far more deaths."
23135,"Is there any other country in the world that managed this, that remained open for mass international tourism throughout the pandemic and has not had a virus surge causing it to subsequently impose restrictions?"
23136,This whole thing is apart of an agenda just wait and see that’s all I’m saying ...good luck to you and yours!
23137,!
23138,Honestly so fucked.
23139,I just told my dad yesterday we wouldn't be coming over for Thanksgiving and he tried to pull out all the stops to try and convince me.
23140,"Hey guy, your elderly in laws would probably highly appreciate it, even though they decided to go."
23141,I just got back from a nearly empty store &amp; got all my holiday baking stuff while they still had it.
23142,No cranberries or TP tho.
23143,"Cooking alone, dropping it off &amp; mailing it."
23144,Is fine.
23145,Yes.
23146,"The NSA collects metadata (who you call, when, and for how long) and can tap any cell phone any time."
23147,"Emails and texts are also laid bare for them to intercept in full, which they do."
23148,[They've spied on the entire EU including America's allies](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/30/nsa-leaks-us-bugging-european-allies) (spying on Merkel for example) and have [hacked foreign companies like Huawei](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/03/nsa-hacked-huawei-servers-watched-companys-executives-nyt-sources-say/) (oh the irony).
23149,"For anybody paying attention, it's pretty obvious that US foreign policy is to project its own secret evildoing onto others in order to manufacture consent for conflict."
23150,COVID-19 is no different.
23151,This whole site is a shitfest.
23152,Fuck these people.
23153,there's no xenophobia in entitlement
23154,No one is wishing for more deaths and such.
23155,I'm simply illustrating why some people are fine with this sudden change to our lifestyle.
23156,"Of course it's not perfect, I worry about my parents every single day."
23157,I was actually already working from home.
23158,But now I am not expected to have the occasional office meeting and other work related bureaucracy.
23159,That's the point.
23160,The pandemic has precipitated big changes that would've taken decades otherwise and it's something I've enjoyed seeing in the midst of terrible mismanagement of and by the human race over the last decades.
23161,So far the vaccines presented do not mean it will eradicate the virus.
23162,"Most people will have protection, yes, but some will still catch it."
23163,"Those who get it might have have less symptoms or will face the ""normal"" symptoms."
23164,It's not black and white and it's still up to everyone to behave properly to prevent further infections after the vaccines are out.
23165,By the time the vaccine comes we will already have near herd immunity
23166,I think they got their wish when Trump got elected.
23167,COVID is just the cherry on top.
23168,Not me.
23169,"Nah, they will blame it on whoever gave it to them."
23170,They will sleep well knowing it wasnt their fault.
23171,We all know who the real murderers are whether they will admit it to themselves or not.
23172,Maybe we're just part of the mass extinction that's been occurring for the past 30 years.
23173,"It's our turn to go, I guess."
23174,"In general, people tend to be more optimistic than they ever should be."
23175,Its a mental defense mechanism that our brains use.
23176,If only we had a functioning central government.
23177,Imagine that.
23178,No shit.
23179,When you have a 99.997% chance of living then fuck it really.
23180,"I'll stay home like I usually do, but I'm basically living a normal life covid or not."
23181,"I tried, I was all in on the 2 weeks to bend the curve, as were everyone I know, look at countries that harder lockdowns than us, it's obvious it doesn't work."
23182,"At some point you're gonna have to admit your beliefs that the only reason we're spiking is because there are people that ""never tried"" is wrong, I still wear a mask too, as does all of my community but we're still spiking"
23183,Less though.
23184,You don’t have to _BoTh SiDeS_ everything.
23185,Quantification matters.
23186,"The point is, the response wasn't 

People reacted to the data and swiftly took the action needed to deal with it."
23187,Thats the only thing that matters.
23188,"You know all these dumb fucks in this country who either downplay the severity of the illness, doubt the statistics (“if a person dies in a car accident they still mark it as covid death!”), or view not wearing a mask as a political statement?"
23189,They get that directly from Trump.
23190,I wanted him to take this seriously and put top experts on the job.
23191,Not putting his fucking son in law in charge of getting PPE.
23192,I wanted him to stop concentrating on the stock market and start concentrating on saving lives.
23193,Because we have 250k dead already and the contagion is accelerating.
23194,Sounds like I’m not the one who needs to expand my horizons.
23195,I'm just going to sit here and wait for the reports to come in complaining that Covid is destroying the turkey industry and that millions of dollars worth of turkeys are going to landfills because no one bought them.
23196,"Sorry, industry that failed to plan for this event, I don't have the fridge or oven space to cook a bird big enough to feed twenty people."
23197,Especially when I'm only planning on feeding three.
23198,"Looking forward to Christmas, where there's barely going to be any gifts on the table because no one made any money this year either."
23199,"&gt; There's nothing special about the dates, just plan a family gathering for June or July."
23200,Except it's when our employees graciously allow us to stop working for a bit.
23201,"Are you going to burn 3 vacation days to travel and see your family, or combine it with a company holiday so your trip doesn't have to be super short and stressful?"
23202,"&gt;	No, we’re “fucked” because people like yourself don’t understand that as cases rise and hospital capacity rises it’s going to cause greater problems in the form of increased deaths."
23203,"Why would you go to the hospital with 0 symptoms, like 80%+ of people infected with covid?"
23204,"Why would you go to the hospital with flu like symptoms, like 90% of symptomatic covid patients?"
23205,“Hospital capacity” is literally just made up.
23206,&gt;	We’re also “fucked” because people like yourself care so little about their fellow Americans (and fellow humans in general) that you have decided their lives are unimportant and not worth protecting/saving.
23207,"Lmao if you wanna stay inside and kill yourself, go for it."
23208,I’m not stopping you.
23209,That’s your call.
23210,"Protect your own life by staying inside, I’ll go on ahead living mine."
23211,"&gt;	But you know your arguments are flawed and that you come across as hateful towards others which is why you make these comments on a throwaway

Not at all."
23212,"I am intentionally hateful to people like yourself because I hate you, it’s pretty much that simple."
23213,"I don’t care about you at all, I don’t care about how hurt your feelings get when confronted with basic facts."
23214,&gt;	Or perhaps it’s a nod that you’re throwing away your future in which case just because you are find throwing away your future doesn’t mean others should be okay with you and others having the same lack of concern for others’ future.
23215,Stay inside then?
23216,Like wtf?
23217,😂
23218,I hope PJ's work is actually listened and taken more into consideration these days.
23219,"Hell, the man could've been doing literal backflips for nearly a decade and sadly now during a global pandemic with ongoing effects of climate change, he's finally being noticed."
23220,Not a chance...our testing capacity isn't capable of that much testing so the number will officially be lower.

23247,Germany may be  able to conjure a fully-functioning intensive care bed out of a hat —  but there isno magic that can produce more staff.
23248,"&gt;  
&gt;The reasons  for this are clear: Comparatively small income for a high level of  responsibility; shift and weekend work and little societal recognition."
23249,"Even before the pandemic, Health Minister Spahn was desperately trying  to recruit nursing staff from abroad."
23250,"&gt;  
&gt;The results of the latest  DIVI survey among intensive care workers will not calm Spahn: 97% do not  think there will be enough staff to deal with a second wave, almost  half are less motivated than they were in the spring and 93% are afraid  that working conditions will deteriorate in the months to come."
23251,That's because their leadership is in shambles just like America/ UK.
23252,It's more of a leadership issue tbh coupled with individual responsibility.
23253,If neither is present...
23254,Nice.

23325,I'm not the one avoiding questions.
23326,Lemmings aren't the only suicidal mammals.
23327,Sweden had the 5th highest death rate in Europe before the second wave started.
23328,It current massive rates of infection mean that its quite likely it will regain that position by the time the second wave is over.
23329,Its strategy of trying to achieve herd immunity is a disaster.
23330,All countries who tried to mimic this have encountered the same disastrous results.
23331,"If the Czechs were as successful in terms of PR as the Swedes have been, for instance at convincing their population they are managing it well and not just stupidly aiming for herd immunity, then people woukd pay attention to the Czechs aa much."
23332,"Any thoughts on this ""optimistic nihilism"" people are  so often embracing?"
23333,"I find it very strange, since it's just existentialism with an edgier moniker."
23334,"Wow, mandatory testing for online classes, someone in administration clearly does not understand how the virus works!"
23335,"There must be another component to this, that isn’t listed in the article, such as students with active online accounts may also have physical access to buildings / study spaces / physical resources"
23336,We need critical thinking skills.
23337,"I wonder with 3 weeks of no community transmission or active cases/deaths, why didn’t he relax all rules considering that they’ll be taking effect come December 13th, by which point, unless something bad happens, they’ll be in their 6th week of no community transmission or cases."
23338,He should restore it back to Stage 1 if it’s going to take this long to take effect.

23366,I seriously wonder whether the US is going to hit herd immunity before a vaccine is even broadly available.
23367,Some studies are suggesting that actual infections are reaching as high as 10x of detected... meaning the US is *actually* seeing *2 million* infections in a day.
23368,"With daily case counts rapidly accelerating, that could hit 70% of the population in a few months."
23369,Well my brother in law is a RN in Texas and they just had to hire 60 new emergency nurses to come to their town and work because they are completely understaffed and getting filled with cases.
23370,And they also had to buy mobile morgues.

23383,The slightly good news is ‘herd immunity’ isn’t a light switch that turns on at 70%.
23384,"I think, already, some places like NY are getting a partial slowing of spread from it."
23385,Even at lower percentages like 10% or 20% it will have a slowing effect on the spread.
23386,"To be sure, I wish we were finding other ways to better slow the spread.. still it is good when doing these back-of-envelope maths to see a little good even in very scary numbers."

23401,I hope Brazil's methods work (or improve) I was just pointing out the article seemed to be implying ethnic/racist bias and which isn't the case.

23432,Either way I am hoping to see that 50 foot robot doing something.
23433,While the rest of the world was worried about COVID the Japanese were building the robot and planing for the Olympic Games.

23462,Apparently there's also no profit in a redesign to get the rate down.
23463,Only improperly done lockdowns destroy economies to that point.
23464,It's a false idea that the economy has to suffer more than necessary because of COVID mitigation.
23465,"Some industries will take a bigger hit than others regardless, but good longterm mitigation nulls the need for severe restrictions like SPH orders or actual lockdowns."

23631,It’s not that we’ve all been isolated for months because a lot of people haven’t.
23632,It’s that we tend to decide how to behave based on what the people around us are doing.

23730,"The primary endpoints of the trial were created just to see if it could prevent COVID-19 (the disease), not prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2."
23731,"They can’t really figure out right now if it prevents infection, but BioNTech’s CEO said it likely has a 50-60% chance of preventing infection, and in all other cases because your body is fighting back, it shortens the amount of time you’re infectious for while asymptomatic and also makes you less infectious than you would’ve otherwise been."
23732,That’s good news because we know that asymptomatic cases tend to have an R_0 less than 0 and tend to have their line of transmission die out if they don’t pass it on to someone who will become symptomatic.

23750,I don't doubt that treatments have gotten better.
23751,But one of my main concerns is that the reason the summer wave was less deadly is that the case numbers were spread out rather than concentrated in like 4 states.
23752,"I get the feeling that we're going to see hotspots like the first wave, where hospitals are so overwhelmed that the death rate spikes again."
23753,"I think this wave will have a higher death to infection ratio than the summer, I just hope it doesn't hit the ratios we saw in spring."

24026,"In contrast, Europeans and Americans have a more independent and free culture, emphasizing personal liberties, freedoms and expression."
24027,They also never have any recent major pandemics due to the quality of health care that's provided in those countries.
24028,"Because of this, you really need to educate people and leaders when a uniform response is needed, otherwise people will feel less inhibited to do whatever the hell they want."
24029,That's why America has performed poorly compared to Europe and NZ.

24039,there are technological ways of helping those ppl instead of taking a mask off to talk.
24040,"JHU is reporting Case Fatality Rate there (CFR), which is deaths per ***known*** case."

24042,"Last CDC estimate for the US I hear was 0.65%, though that was a while ago."
24043,And it's skewed toward older people and those with pre-existing conditions.
24044,"Not that 0.65% is great, if 80% of the people eventually got COVID we'd be looking at 1.7 million dead from it."
24045,I sure don't want that.
24046,Teletherapy does not work for many people.
24047,Therapy at its core is based on connection and you lose that.

24060,This disease sucks and having it I really realize why it’s so dangerous.
24061,"My wife, my two kids and myself all got it within 24 hours so it’s extremely contagious."
24062,No one in my house has had a fever yet so we would be missed in screening.
24063,If I didn’t have sick pay I could see how I would have the logic that no fever = I’m fine to work and that is very not true.
24064,The media does not even come close to over hyping this illness.
24065,It’s no joke.
24066,"I want to say a hard shutdown will never happen, but I’m pretty sure we’re getting closer and closer to a point where something definitely needs to happen as businesses that basically need to stay open due to no help from the government won’t have *anyone* coming to their stores as they’re all sick or probably in the hospital!"
24067,No business with customers &gt; no money &gt; RIP.
24068,Or we could go hardcore with masks and social distancing and actually enforce stuff on people not wearing masks or crowding around.
24069,It gets dicey with private Thanksgiving gatherings that will be the true spreaders.
24070,How would the police stop big gatherings from happening if most (maybe even their own families) will be having one?
24071,Do you forcibly stop it if a place is littered with cars?
24072,Do you kindly ask for everyone to get a mask or at least get tested after?
24073,It feels so weird thinking of ways to stop big Thanksgivings if nearly everyone will have one or go to one.
24074,Then you got the same thing for Christmas and New Years.
24075,Just about every college is shutting down this week  and reopening late January.
24076,Those kids have to get home somehow
24077,It's a morally questionable position to justify largely preventable deaths in column A by pointing to less deaths in column B.
24078,"This line of thinking nullifies all the ""they would have died this year anyway"" deaths which is substantial in the group of people most vulnerable to covid."
24079,"I mean if you are 80 years old, there is probably a 15% chance you'll die within 12 months covid or not."
24080,In the month of April you were way above the excess rate... And you are heading back there now.
24081,Something like 8% of everyone who has died in Sweden this year has died from Covid-19.

24083,Swedes are generally wonderful people except for my ex girlfriend...
24084,I even have a Swedish aunt :)
24085,Go to the source data for that graph and add Austria to the list....doesn’t make them look great.
24086,The way it’s presented makes the UK look worse than ‘Europe’.
24087,How would you know?
24088,"As a scientist who has taught science in government schools and lived a number of years in both the UK and Thailand, I am certain that the scientific knowledge of an average Briton is substantially greater than that of an average Thai."
24089,What's interesting is how this fact hasn't benefited the UK during the pandemic.
24090,"Living in Thailand now, it's apparent that Thais have more respect for and trust in scientists, teachers and doctors."
24091,How much this is due to differences in science education versus general cultural differences is pretty much impossible to distinguish.
24092,"Please note I am talking about Thailand specifically, where a government school class may have double the number of students compared with a UK class, and teaching practices are well known to be highly outdated."
24093,"I do not believe the ""West"" is more educated than the ""East""."

24250,Well people back then pretty much said the exact same thing you just said.
24251,"Yeah, or he's manipulating the market."
24252,Or possibly smoking the reefer.
24253,just stay in you shithole so you all can die in the US and avoid spreading the virus to other countries
24254,We pay less taxes than the US and we don't need to pay health insurance on top of it.
24255,.
24256,.
24257,So
24258,Never said it was a fact.
24259,The nature of my original comment was opinion in that respect.
24260,It doesn’t need to be labeled as such
24261,Chinese data is probably more reliable than American data this year.
24262,"They had a problem at the beginning of the year but if you have been paying attention (you don’t seem to have been doing so) you know almost every single state (especially Florida) just blatantly lies to everyone in their state about coronavirus, from designing their system to count as few cases as possible to weird school regulations that prevent you from being notified when your own child is exposed."
24263,So yeah Chinese data is suspect?
24264,American data is known lies.
24265,"Factually wrong information, rigged by politicians, and it’s not even secret!"
24266,Yet people like you will pretend like it’s not happening.
24267,"So dumb, this country."
24268,So dumb.
24269,"No, of course not."
24270,GOP DEATH CULT
24271,"&gt;Also, here is the source for Chinese food distribution during the Wuhan lockdown."
24272,"It worked in China, a country that is much poorer per capita than us."
24273,No reason it wouldn't work here.
24274,"Uhh....that doesn't sound like it's working very well....
&gt;Some districts have even begun to regulate the group delivery services, prohibiting supermarkets from selling to individuals and forcing communities to buy groceries in bulk."
24275,"Even if a neighborhood can group order food, some Wuhan residents have complained about the quality and price of the produce delivered."
24276,"David Dai, a resident who lives on the outskirts of Wuhan, told AFP that onions and tomatoes he and his neighbors ordered arrived rotten."
24277,He said they were forced to throw out a third of the food.
24278,"However, grocery stores and communities are struggling to fill the increasing number of orders have begun to set minimum order requirements for delivery."
24279,"While one supermarket required a minimum of 30 orders, another store only allowed 1,000 delivery orders per day, the AFP reported."
24280,They got a preselected thing of groceries and many weren't even good.
24281,Heaven forbid you have a kid with different needs or allergies or an eating disorder.
24282,&gt;maybe it's an age thing.
24283,Ah!
24284,May I ask how old you are?
24285,Because your ignorance kind of seems like ignorance that comes with no experience in the actual world.
24286,"And I don't say that to disparage young people (I'm 37 btw), many are smarter than me in many areas."
24287,But your fantasy land scenarios and shocking lack of ability to admit you're putting other people in danger to serve you just reeks of life inexperience.
24288,&gt;How am I saving gas money by picking up my groceries?
24289,I still have to drive to the grocery store.
24290,I don't think you've even been reading my posts.
24291,"Good god, you're not even tipping extra?"
24292,"I assumed you were going out to OTHER places less, and not spending money on normal things you might buy at stores, thus saving money...but whatever."
24293,"That, and the fact that we don't seem to have herd immunity to the common cold, or the flu."
24294,Why do we think it's going to work any better for covid?
24295,&gt;I don’t believe any independent media outside Singapore would agree with you.
24296,"I agree, even in Singapore a lot of people wouldn't agree with me."

24299,He said Corona virus panic is dumb.
24300,He said kids are essentially immune.
24301,He said he won't take the vaccine when it comes out.
24302,Also all this.
24303,"&gt;On the podcast, Musk argued that instead of sweeping stay-at-home orders to mitigate the spread of coronavirus, ""anyone who is at risk should be quarantined until the storm passes."""
24304,"&gt;When Swisher confronted Musk with the possibility that people would still die in the process, he replied bluntly: ""Everybody dies."""
24305,"&gt;""The question is what, on balance, serves the greater good,"" Musk continued, adding that the lockdowns did not accomplish that and the pandemic is a ""no-win situation."""
24306,He seems to have a very simplistic/superficial view that really doesn't match the facts.
24307,He should probably stick to his fields of expertise or at least take the time to understand the problem better.
24308,Right!
24309,They could have a negative test and then come into contact with someone positive on the way home from the test and now they’re infected.
24310,What good was the initial negative test from the standpoint of protecting a classroom full of people?
24311,And then add in that it’s for online classes and this makes even less sense.
24312,There are instructions on the bag and online and even on the Turkey Bags package if you use one of those.

24389,They walk to a nearby park to see other kids.
24390,They went to the library for a school book.
24391,They go shopping for home decor.
24392,Isn't someone sent home for contact tracing (proximity to someone with covid making them a transmission risk) supposed to self isolate and quarantine?

24431,"It's always worth remembering that countries have different ways of recording how many have died from Corona, which sometimes hide the true Corona death toll (e.g."
24432,USA).
24433,Another thing worth remembering that Corona doesn't only have an effect on the people actually catching the virus.

24464,There might be a different definition of currency where you are from but a currency has a face value.

24468,In Colorado for instance all of our parks and effectively our state shut down but those traveling from out of state to our parks just refused to follow our procedures as it was different where they came from.

24905,"That man is truly such a gift during this shit, that imagery has been in my mind too."
24906,"Starting to hear it, feel it shake the ground... this is going to be nightmarish, stay safe everyone, do not swap air with anyone outside your tiny bubble... lots of love, stay safe, stay sane"
24907,We’ll also be able to learn from it and look out for other possible viruses in the future that may be similar.
24908,"ya know what, I might just try that"
24909,[removed]
24910,I like to point out the fact that the federal lack of leadership means that the lockdown we did do was all but useless.
24911,"Piecemeal, one state this week, one state the next week, Alabama didn't lock down until Georgia was already about to reopen, etc."
24912,"Everyone's efforts totally wasted, even the people who followed everything that was asked of them."
24913,Pick n save ftw

24915,Can't trust a guy with two first names.
24916,This.
24917,The peak is projected to be right around the inauguration
24918,"Yep, I saw the news for that."
24919,I just wanted to make it clear in my head that treatment has been lagging behind prevention.
24920,"Sure, I've just heard theoretically you can't contact the virus through the digestive tract"
24921,"&gt; In Springfield, CoxHealth will add nearly 150 beds in the next few weeks, which is equivalent to a mid-sized hospital, said Dr. Shawn Usery during a briefing Friday."
24922,"However, he said, he needs more staff to care for the patients who fill that added space, KYTV reports."
24923,"&gt; “We are currently looking across the United States to find nurses to help care for patients,” he said."
24924,Maybe.
24925,Doesn't sound like that was their first option.
24926,Perhaps the military does not have large number of extra ICU nurses available.
24927,I’m gonna pick up a rotisserie chicken &amp; make mashed potatoes probably
24928,Bro if you think I would t rather stay home.
24929,Your crazy.
24930,You miss the part where we all get paid to stay home?
24931,Look  to the leadership.
24932,That's your answer
24933,"Actually, post-Christmas and New Years is supposed to be worse."

24937,For those who don’t know yet: the incubation period is up to 14 days.
24938,"And then you could be symptomatic &amp; contagious for ~14 days, but possibly longer."
24939,Schools are places where children LEARN!
24940,I mean ... this has not been up for debate in centuries.
24941,Where is this “school are child care facilities BS’ coming from?!
24942,?

24952,Pretty weird that you’re carving out a job for yourself.
24953,"Cargo would almost positively fall under one of your well defined categories, unless you are against getting cargo of essential supplies to people."
24954,While this was fun.
24955,There is no one that can tell me to stay home or stay away from my family.
24956,"I can make those decisions on my own, and live with the consequences."
24957,"If you want to be managed by the same government that is ran by Donald, go for it."
24958,Some people are too young (babies/small children) -- I don't know the cutoff age they will use but the Astrazeneca vaccine was tested on age 5-12.
24959,"Some people have immune disorders, or have a risk of being allergic to the shot ingredients, or are undergoing chemotherapy, or actively have some other serious illness."
24960,"You can't get new infections if everyone is infected, i guess"
24961,Because following Asia's success would mean putting most of the burden of the COVID response onto the government and not the citizens.
24962,Yeah I think doing all those mental gymnastics might’ve worn you out lol

24974,"The Asian countries kept their borders closed and kept up their travel restrictions, most of the EU countries did not and the US never really had any worthwhile restrictions on travel."
24975,Well my wife and I are still traveling for New Years.
24976,"Going to Dallas, but we will be driving."
24977,Renting a house with some friends from Cali and other friends who live in Texas.

24979,Can't imagine it now.
24980,"Well, a very promising treatment, the Regeneron antibody cocktail that was given to the President was just given emergency use authorization by the FDA."
24981,Maybe cheap relative to ideology.
24982,"But in the west, apparently life is cheap relative to cash."
24983,"Rapid tests are notoriously unreliable, some studies say 50% false negative"
24984,"Actually right after, it says they anticipate ""air travel to fall to 2.4 million from 4.58 million last year""."
24985,"So I am curious what they define as ""travel"" for the 50 million number."
24986,"Might be literally anyone going anywhere, even if it's just a 30 min drive?"
24987,"In that case, that makes more sense as I can see a lot of children visiting parents, etc if they live so close (they likely visit them regularly anyways)."
24988,Tbh I shall know this stuff as I am not exactly novel to the English speaking world :)
24989,This sub has a massive boner for the IMHE model now that it predicts doom and gloom.

24994,"I feel shame as well, I don't wanna be an american anymore..."
24995,"&gt;This is literally one of the ways China dealt with covid, by setting up food pickup points

You're gonna have to show me a source for that, cause I couldn't find it."
24996,"I found this:
https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/3/25/21193817/home-delivery-china-coronavirus-us-alibaba-amazon
which shows how horible delays were both in China and here."
24997,"And this:

https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3078749/coronavirus-how-chinas-army-food-delivery-drivers-helped-keep

which shows how China's existing home delivery infrastructure helped delivery, but nothing about food pickup points."
24998,I doubt this was a nationwide thing.
24999,"&gt; not fucking fast food employees

This doesn't even make any sense?"
25000,You're opposed to this?
25001,Drive thru food is exactly what you're saying you want with all the grocery stuff?
25002,"&gt;It would be a simple matter of restructuring the parking lot for a line of cars to circle through a pickup point, and arranging pickups by appointment."
25003,"Simple, yeah, right."
25004,"Just think about that in a big city like Toronto, and how mcuh people would want to order, and how limited the stock would be."
25005,"Think about how much of a line there is for Tim Fucking hortons on a random weekday morning, and now think about three times as many people all trying to time their grocery pick ups."
25006,"Seriously, what the fuck?"
25007,&gt;.
25008,"If grocery stores become pickup only, people will figure it out

Good plan."
25009,"&gt;The way you think is representative of western nation

Your way of thinking is insane and impossible."
25010,"All I was trying to show is that when you stay home, other people are being put at risk to bring you your shit."
25011,Why is that so hard to admit?
25012,Why do you have to make up some sort of magical fantasy scenario where no one has to interact?
25013,"Even if I agreed that it was possible, it's not what's happening right now."
25014,You staying home right now is forcing other people to be more at risk than they would be if they didn't have to gather and deliver your shit.
25015,"But whatever, you don't want to admit that....just make sure you tip them extra, your'e saving all this gas money after all."
25016,Increased domestic fuel purchases.
25017,"If card X usually buys fuel from gas station A in Cali and then for 2 weeks is now buying guys from gas station B in Florida well, boom."
25018,[removed]
25019,"I mean they could theoretically all stay in a bubble if they can work from home and already bought groceries, and then drive directly to the event."
25020,"I’m not saying it’s good at all, but it’s better than taking zero precautions."
25021,you fucking idiots
25022,"Well at -20C/-4F it doesn’t seem so hard to me, for Pfizer(which Europe contracted) it will be harder as it needs to be stored at -80."
25023,"So, would this mean not as much mask wearing in the summer?"
25024,"I know masks are good, but I’m so sick of wearing them."
25025,"If you want to minimize future events, the country of origin matters a lot."
25026,Do I even need to explain this?
25027,Hearing it and witnessing it are two very different things.
25028,"We were, but things changed \~2 months ago."
25029,Early on (back in March) we had an outbreak in the mountains due to the virus spreading via travelers/vacationers.
25030,"After that, we locked down hard and benefited from a proactive governor, fairly responsible populace, and well spread out population (bar Denver)."
25031,"Then kids went back to school, colleges welcomed students back, and the general population became fatigued over COVID."
25032,"Since then it's been a junk show across the state, which disappoints me as I was proud of our early response."
25033,"Of note, mask use is fairly good here outside of a few rural towns and college students /young adults partying."
25034,"So in my mind mask use alone can't stop this, we need additional regulations."
25035,We did our weekly grocery shopping earlier this evening.
25036,Publix supermarket was packed with people.
25037,Just my wife and I will be celebrating in our home.
25038,I got us a tiny little turkey breast to cook and was shocked at the amount of people rolling through buying big 20lbs+ turkeys and all sorts of loaded down carts.
25039,Only 5 million people less are traveling this year compared to last year?
25040,WTF is wrong with people?
25041,Anything to shit on America.
25042,"One person admit it will be free in America, pissed that it will be free, they then started to say it will be free but how many people will have access to it."
25043,SEP ends in most states (44) November 28.
25044,End of standard UI for most.
25045,Maybe keep providing care without reporting the care and medical supplies so they are not charged.
25046,I saw something similar to this in the front page where bus drivers would strike by not charging for the bus fair so that the passengers wouldn't be affected yet they could still send a message to the admin and ceo.
25047,been flying weekly since June.
25048,The airports are empty and the most sanitized.

25073,Nobody asked where you were from.
25074,"&gt; In other words, what the masses of the public believe at any given time can be shaped by the government and by its newspapers and broadcasters, simply by hiding facts that the people who actually control the country don’t want the public to know."
25075,"Censorship is the core of dictatorship, and almost all countries are actually dictatorships, but the news-media there censor-out that fact, instead of publishing it."
25076,"So, the reality of censorship is, itself, hidden from the public, in order for the people who control the government to control the masses so that the nation can be called a “democracy.”

Lol this shit."

25085,"What they're doing is still more than most people who are holding festivities is, just showing how bad this is gonna get 😬"
25086,This is such bullshit.
25087,The US population is unwilling to sacrifice personal comfort for the safety of others.
25088,That’s why the measures are failing.
25089,The wearing of masks is politicised to a degree where the common good is no longer a thing.
25090,“Muh freedoms” are more important than your fellow countrymen’s lives.
25091,If a city of 4.5million (Melbourne) can lock down for over 6 months and eradicate COVID then middle America can too.
25092,They’re just **unwilling** to.
25093,These are conspiracy theorist talking points.
25094,We’ll do whatever the gods of capitalism say will squeeze out an extra cent of profit.
25095,Pandemic won’t matter.

25099,This is definitely something I have noticed over this pandemic
25100,I’ve been hearing this since February
25101,"To be fair, I didn't care about society before the Pandemic either."
25102,I keep to myself and try to interact with people as little as possible.
25103,Not going to let what I do in my life be determined by what other people say or do.
25104,Studies show that  anti-maskers are narcissistic people and have other anti-social disorders.
25105,Anti-maskers are more likely to wear masks if they believe it will protect them and not just others.
25106,"Yes, we beat it."

25111,Huh ?
25112,In what way?
25113,The way I posted a serious comment disgusting the media hyping reinfection times?
25114,The way I posted a reply to a commenter showing a recent article?

25137,I went to a pharmacy and got my flu shot for free today in Canada.
25138,It was nice.
25139,&gt; We can deny the virus but then our hospitals get crowded.
25140,Those firsthand accounts from doctors and nurses saying that these people dying alone gasping still claim COVID is a hoax and not real.
25141,I just can't even with these people anymore.
25142,Death is the ultimate equalizer and now they deny it almost.
25143,That's something unheard of.
25144,they were just celebrating Biden's victory so it's fine.
25145,&gt;Well it is already everywhere here so it’s not like it’s not go to spread anywhere that was previously safe.
25146,"Yes, virtually every county in America has active cases — but just because the virus has a presence in a given county or city, it doesn't mean the pandemic can't spread further."
25147,"Within affected counties more towns, more suburbs, and more damn neighbourhoods and even streets will suffer outbreaks."
25148,And more human tragedies will unfold.
25149,It can and will get worse.
25150,"There is an inevitable and unpredictable massive  LEAP in deaths per day coming when an overwhelming number of hospitals are beyond their crisis capacities across the country, which I anticipate to be two weeks after Thanksgiving following viral incubation periods."
25151,"When there is no room in hospitals to save “saveable” lives, whether it be COVID or anything else, 2k deaths per day will look very much like the “good ole days.”"
25152,It will be free at the point of service for anyone
25153,"Another sub to ask is /r/personalfinance, this kind of issue comes up a lot there"
25154,"That’s good, weatherwise it’s great to be outdoors this time of year so that’s probably what’s helping"
25155,"It might be different in some places, but usually a veto override is a brand new vote."
25156,"You veto the bill, and the legislature has to vote with a veto-proof majority *again*."

25158,"For sure, it's an interesting question."
25159,"I saw that the Army Nurse Corp had 11,000 nurses, but how many of them are specialized in ICU care is also a good question."
25160,Not every nurse available can be used to handle COVID patients.
25161,Can we stop upvoting every word that Bill Gates utters?
25162,I don’t care what he thinks about the vaccine.
25163,I care what scientists who study vaccines think.
25164,Why don’t we upvote some of them instead of one of the worst capitalists this country has ever seen?
25165,Damn you are triggered easily.
25166,Maybe you did go to a childcare facility instead of school.
25167,Out of curiosity where do such places exist?
25168,I’ve lived in 10 states (both “blue” and “red”) and have never seen as a child care facility masquerading as a public school.
25169,Was it a charter or some type of kooky religious school?
25170,The option is actually to use other mitigation methods suited for the long-term instead of waiting to have a national lockdown when cases are massively surging.
25171,well collectively 99.8% of us will be fine.
25172,Good info.

25180,"She's flying to another state to ""escape the lockdown."""
25181,I'm so angry.
25182,"She, or someone else, is probably gonna get sick because of her actions."
25183,"Meanwhile, I'm over here feeling guilty because I hit the grocery store and pharmacy once a week."
25184,"Like, if I planned better, I could probably stretch that to 10 days."
25185,The floor here is made out of floor
25186,But that's not what the commenter said.
25187,15.2 million people per year die of heart disease or stroke in the world every year and no one bats an eye
25188,"After more than half a year, you still believe in bullshit."
25189,This shows why America fucks up so bad.
25190,Americans are stupid.
25191,Who knew?
25192,"Yes, it is not that simple, I understand that in some cases the requirements of social distancing are  unreasonable,  however we have people who are going out and refusing to take the most basic precautions to slow the spread, and are continuing to live their lives as if nothing is happening."
25193,"I've had people yell at me for wiping down commonly used surfaces, I've had people tell me that the virus is a government hoax."
25194,"So yes, I am angry, and yes, I am going to blame these people, because they don't care about the Human lives that are attached to these numbers by doing even the most basic precautions."
25195,Does not work for many kids.
25196,Without supervision kids are not able to do virtual learning.
25197,These are zombies not vampires dawg.
25198,Do you also spend your time complain that mandating pants is retarded?
25199,Because we wear clothes for the sake of public safety too.
25200,They don't even have to vote against it.
25201,They just have to not show up.

25206,They are OP is spewing misinformation.
25207,WTF.
25208,I had no idea EMS professionals made so little.
25209,"I am a nurse and I seriously can’t imagine the stress that EMS workers endure compared to what I do, and I am paid 4x as much."
25210,EMS are the boots on the ground.
25211,"A mobile ER charged with not only providing medical care, but pulling off mental health/social services/and often times law enforcement."
25212,This is ridiculous.
25213,"Well to be fair if you're 90+ years old, you've pretty much lived life already and it's only a matter of time anyways."
25214,Covid or not.
25215,How do you fix any dying empire?
25216,Did the Romans fix what was plaguing the western empire?
25217,How about the Ottomans during the late 19th century?
25218,Contemporary westerners were brought up in the postwar miracle where anything seemed possible.
25219,Now the bubble is crashing back down to earth.
25220,"I booked Hawaii tickets, but due to the testing requirement and unreliable testing locally I canceled."

25227,It is ironic that the people who are most opposed to mandatory lockdowns are generally the same people doing stupid shit —like not wearing masks while collected in large groups indoors — that make lockdowns necessary.
25228,I’ve been hearing that it’s like a 9/11 everyday and people still shrug their shoulders.

25310,Im not sure I agree with this.
25311,Testing was massively ramped up during the summer and we all watched the results of hundreds of thousands of tests per day in the likes of France.
25312,They just didnt do anything with the results other than rearrange a few deck chairs.
25313,The reality is that they were more concerned with image than efficacy.
25314,All over Europe goverments won the PR battle with their citizens during the summer and early Autumn.

25333,"Trump did this, intentionally."
25334,I'm glad I can be with them for my favorite holiday.
25335,Here there are many instances of cops pulling someone over and not having a mask and the driver asking them to put one on or keep as distanced as possible and they still won’t.

25337,people want to know who to call to report on the police?
25338,America did this to themselves.
25339,China handed us the bullets but they told us they were bullets and we knowingly and deliberately loaded them into a Twitter account and blasted ourselves in the face pretending it was no big deal.

For all intents and purposes we know that algorithms tech giants used can both be useful for getting you things you *actually* want to see, like when Google notices you are searching for rings and will recommend wedding rings as an ad, but it can also very easily be used, like in Facebook's case, to appease set groups as to bolster the appeal and mainstay of a platform."
25364,Twitter not banning Trump and his many bot followers is a pretty clear example of how tech companies happily skirt moral lines to maintain a profit.
25365,"I can already feel the ""WELL ACHTUALLY"" coming."
25366,It's not a UN member because china won't let them in.
25367,The cou tries that decide who gets membership are all buddies of china.
25368,Taiwan had no help from china in this.
25369,They were refused information from WHO because of china.
25370,They were never privy to any of the information.
25371,China was banking on them having a severe outbreak and bring decimated.
25372,Taiwan knew better and locked down before any other country.
25373,"Also, on par?"
25374,"They have roughly 500 cases total over this entire year, last I checked."
25375,"No, the workers have literally no choice."
25376,"If they quit, no unemployment."
25377,In this particular county.
25378,We are not seeing uniform trends in domestic violence across the US during covid.
25379,Some counties are seeing far fewer calls (not necessarily a good sign) but we’re seeing vastly different things depending on community resources and access.
25380,"&gt;I am so confused as to what is going on at the moment, someone may enlighten me but I’m struggling to understand why they’re still allowing people to travel?"
25381,Because the second the government takes away a right there is no guarantee it will ever come back.
25382,All of you people that want Big Brother to protect you from a slightly dangerous virus are lost.
25383,There is not and never has been any actual way of controlling this pandemic.
25384,The virus was already around the globe before anybody knew anything was wrong because of its gestation period and mildly or asymptomatic carriers.
25385,"Every country that does business with China had thousands of people flying there and back every week or two checking up on business operations and meeting with suppliers, by the time this thing showed itself as a problem in China it was already percolating everywhere else."

Black Friday"
25387,Nah man I’ve been responsible this whole pandemic.
25388,I’m not missing a major holiday with my folks because other people suck.
25389,What a constructive and intelligent response.
25390,Care to provide facts?
25391,Because freedom.
25392,"Maybe the USA administration could fake a massive terrorist attack and scare people in their houses, because war and freedom eats reason for breakfast."
25393,"Because some of them, not you obviously, that this drug is only being produced in tiny numbers in comparison to the scale of the problem, requires a hospital or other medical visit to be administered as it's an iv, is an antiviral ace2 receptor inhibitor so it needs to be given early to avoid the severe critical stage immune system dysregulation that covid causes and it would not help, and thus is essentially not going to be very helpful in a pandemic situation."
25394,"That might be why it's downvoted, because people who understand nothing believe again that this covid thing is overblown and easily solvable."
25395,Here I am in tokyo talking of a shut down with less than 1000 people per day.
25396,Y'all in the US are fucked.
25397,Can't go home and visit my ill  father cuz y'all fucking idiots.
25398,"I dont want any of this, point being masks delay individuals from getting it at best."
25399,Vaccines are viable for some strains and since we know covid has hit cats dogs and minks we have proof it species hops.
25400,"Since the mink variant is back into people we know it will mutate and come back 

What we dont know is what other species have it

What we do know is its impossible to quarantine nature ( think rats ) 

The economy is already changed forever, remote work is here and likely to stay regardless of everyones vaccine optimism I dont see vaccines keeping up with this ... much like they dont keep up with the flu 

At this point society has changed and just doesnt know it yet"
25401,People are so stupid
25402,Family always come first for some.
25403,"Perhaps it’s the mindset that if they catch it, they’ll at least be within the vicinity of loved ones rather in a hospital bed across the country all alone with a doctor holding a phone to their head before they take their last breath."
25404,And you would think that description of current hospital scenarios would be enough for some families to call of their gatherings.
25405,"I’m sure some will test social distancing with masks, but there will obviously be some where no mitigation is enforced and it’s a free for all."
25406,Before it was people bringing their politics to the table and now it will be who is wearing a mask and socially distancing or not.
25407,And the US already spends the most money per capita on healthcare of all countries worldwide.
25408,The legalized corruption makes it so actually *getting* healthcare is expensive for people.
25409,Its less important to wear pants than it is a mask at this point in time.
25410,Try going anywhere with no pants and underwear and you will see how effective society can be at enforcing rules.

25412,"Sure, but that person could go on and infect younger residents, not to mention the healthcare workers themselves and *their* families."
25413,Or do none of those lives matter either?
25414,"Also, we've already seen from superspreader events that often people completely unrelated to that event are the ones who end up dying."

25423,See: US
25424,Most of my colleagues take COVID seriously.
25425,We started working from home since April.
25426,But they like to think that a vaccine is a magic wand that will make everything go away.
25427,"They don’t know that even with a vaccine, it’ll be years before we experience normal."
25428,We may not even remember what it’s like by the time it comes.
25429,"Not necessarily travel, that's much more situational."
25430,"But for most, it's a large gathering of extended family."

25439,All the while he's freaking out because I may have gotten exposed at work.

25446,Right?

25449,We are all working from home and super careful (I have a high risk child) so occasionally we see each other but I won't be seeing her on the holidays or for two weeks after.
25450,"I told her we can see relief coming and the virus is spiking everywhere right now, please cancel."

25452,She's lonely and not making good decisions.
25453,Breaks my heart (she's 78 and honestly one of my best friends).
25454,"Might not have significant impact on cases, but if they're delivering to high risk, it could have amazing impact on deaths within weeks."
25455,"According to [this](https://unherd.com/2020/11/why-is-france-full-of-anti-vaxxers/) article, mistrust in the government is one of the primary reasons that the French are opposed to vaccines."

25474,Fucken yanks.....
25475,"China locked down for 21 days in Feb-March, it was going out of control with thousands of cases popping up in every province."
25476,They did it once and did it right.
25477,"It's pretty simple really, the virus can not incubate for more than 14 days, lock down, mass testing, identify+quarantine the sick, and done, you are left with a society with no virus."
25478,But that lockdown better be strict and enforced.
25479,"Those that did not want to make the sacrifice of that 21 day strict lockdown, are doomed to suffer a multi-year pandemic + high amount of deaths"
25480,"Welp The virus gonna virus especially now that it’s widely propagated in the US, and unfortunately lots of people gonna be traditional people this time of year without restrictions and... results gonna ensue."

25523,"We have a President in the USA for example who said that COVID-19 will just go away, who hasn’t been to any COVID-19 related meetings in over 4 months, and who just today went golfing instead of attending the G-20 summit on pandemic preparedness."
25524,We have McConnell who has had approved relief bills on his desk for months but refuses to bring them to a vote and help millions of Americans at the brink of eviction and homelessness simply to ensure that the deficit lands on Democrats during Biden’s presidency instead of on Republicans during Trump’s.
25525,"We have people gathering in large crowds to protest the disinformation campaign on election fraud, many of whom are not wearing masks."
25526,"We have people who are hosting large weddings, parties, and planning to travel for Thanksgiving, probably Christmas too."
25527,"Earlier this year we even had states refusing to lock down schools, requiring by law for children to be sent to school in close proximity with their peers and teachers while everyone with an ounce of rational thought told them it was a bad idea and children would die; and guess what?"
25528,Children died.
25529,Your argument of the current stage of this pandemic being exclusively a result of a lack of preparedness is hilariously wrong.
25530,Sheer stupidity is in fact a major contributing factor.
25531,A lack of preparedness was a semi-valid excuse when this pandemic started.
25532,Everything since then has been the result of blatant stupidity.
25533,No formatting on purpose because I want the main paragraph to run on to properly highlight the insanity of the situation we’re in.

25545,It's one thing to reject social contact for 2 weeks.
25546,2 months is a stretch.
25547,2 years is something none of us signed up for and is either not feasible or will cause a host of mental health issues.

25605,That is a good point.
25606,I think it may have to do with the randomness of initial spread.
25607,This plague is driven by super spreading events.
25608,"The Wuhan version wasn't as infectious but because of how dense, polluted and cold it is in Wuhan/ the Chinese New Year celebrations/ military games, it kind of just accelerated the spread."
25609,"Compared to Wuhan, it didn't really pick up in Italy until after Milan Fashion Week and Ski Week."
25610,"This is like compared to Seoul, Daegu is a much smaller city with less visitors from Wuhan."
25611,Seoul totally should've had an outbreak before Daegu.
25612,But it didn't depend on population flow but whether there was a superspreader and what actions she took/not took to prevent further spread.
25613,Does that make sense?
25614,Thanks for the correction.

25645,So is this post saying that Americans gathering with family that they most likely already see rather frequently or in some cases family they almost never see is going to make it worse.
25646,I'd like to point out that the 5 million chinese people weren't traveling in a world that's Social Distancing or wearing masks or many of the other things that have changed since then.
25647,Not to mention i don't know how many people travel out of the country to celebrate Thanksgiving.
25648,So not exactly an apples to apples comparison.

25681,"She told me she would have a portable air purifier, got one of those flask face dividers from a doctor friend, and has a mask and a UV light pen to clean things or whatever, and that's why it was safe and why I should go."
25682,This is where I should mention that this aunt has stage 4 melinoma and is currently under chemotherapy!!
25683,She is also obese and has breathing issues.
25684,"Well, everyone cancelled after a bit because no shit, covid looks like a bad idea even to my insane family memebrs."
25685,And my aunt has now somehow caught covid.
25686,I guess she wasn't being as safe as she claimed and I have no idea if she will survive this.

25846,My city just got 16 new cases after having none for the past months.
25847,"They’re out handing out $300 fines to anyone not wearing a mask in public spaces, in or outdoors"
25848,The virus was already politicized.
25849,"In fact, that's really the point of the chart and discussion."
25850,"I won't pretend to be neutral, mostly because I want to save lives."
25851,"Aww, its so cute when FDELAYERS prevent the public  from any medical innovations they need as usual"
25852,Yep I figured as much... hence why I’m staying home when I’m not at work.
25853,"Whenever I bring up the number of deaths to certain family members, they say “the numbers are inflated.”"
25854,how would you feel if you heard that someone took your advice and died?
25855,Just wondering.
25856,You don't have to wear a mask inside your home... or did you not know that?
25857,😏
25858,Why are people this stupid?
25859,a lot of people just really can't come to terms with the fact that vaccinating the whole population will be a huge struggle for a whole lot of reasons.
25860,It's not going to be fast or easy or simple at any point.
25861,america is essentially incapable of large scale things like that anymore because of our political gridlock.
25862,Early on in the pandemic the Republicans voted to essentially tie her hands from issuing a mandate that would essential require masks.
25863,"The local city council for my area is constantly at war with the Republicans who question masks non-stop with with them, even NOW."
25864,It has been an uphill battle every step of the way and the areas suffering the most are without a doubt mostly red.
25865,Unfortunately these areas are all butted up against each other so there's no dodging them even when you live in more liberal leaning areas.
25866,"Anyway, long story short, I'm incredibly grateful for this lady and she has caught a TON of flack for sticking to her guns on this thing, even though the mandate has been voluntary."
25867,"This is only the tip of the iceberg, don't forget after thanks giving is Christmas and New Years."
25868,Even more people will travel for that.
25869,"I’m a little confused by 


*To give more context to these rolling averages, consider that in a typical year, over a two-week period, you can expect about 28 out of 100,000 people die."
25870,"So if you're looking at deaths over 14 days per 100k, a value of 28 would represent a doubling of the baseline mortality rate."
25871,"*

How could the same figure represent both the average and a double of the baseline?"
25872,&gt;People should understand that paying taxes is also a noble way to help those less fortunate.
25873,Love this.
25874,Well said.
25875,"I'm Canadian, and our system is not perfect, but I do believe that this way of thinking is critical to a healthy, sustainable society."
25876,"Should be elderly, health care workers, and essential business employees..."
25877,"Though, I'm betting on there being an uproar when a tone deaf celebrity/athlete (maybe many) posts about their early vaccine on social media."
25878,Just watch.
25879,Do you think those children don't go to school for 8 hours a day?
25880,"If there are children there without their parents, its a child care facility."
25881,"It is also an education facility, but de fucking facto anywhere you leave your kids without you being present is engaged in child care."
25882,"Yes, I do get triggered by stupid people."
25883,I think its a positive quality.
25884,I do know about stats.
25885,Hence why the stats you gave are bullshit.
25886,100% survival rate under 20 would mean nobody has died.
25887,So you are admitting to your own crap.
25888,"which is why we should have had a hard shutdown with enough stimulus for everyone, rather then expect buisnesses to remain open when most people arn't going to shop."
25889,"now people can't afford to work or shop or risk dying, and buisnesses can't remain open."
25890,"At this time, pandemic was really dangerous for all people, not only for 70-90 years old, so it make sens."
25891,"Not for the first time, I’m glad Australia is more Asian than American these days."
25892,A lot of people I've talked to are waiting a few months take take the vaccine when its available.
25893,I'm sure eventually it will become mandatory but not right away
25894,"How much more death and sickness 
 do Americans have to see before making mask wearing required."
25895,So easy to do.
25896,So easy to slow/stop the spread.
25897,"I’ve been sick with long-haul COVID, know people with average length COVID, and a friend who died."
25898,Many have lost so much more.
25899,our testing capacity is probably at or near its limit.
25900,number will have a ceiling as a result.
25901,"Four or five months ago, I said we would hit 250k."
25902,"I was mocked, and those mocking comments have since deleted themselves."
25903,"With the current trajectory we are on, 350k deaths are all but certain."
25904,450 is likely.
25905,600k is possible.
25906,American individualism has metastasized into apathy and indifference.
25907,"Our inability to care for people we don't know, our unwillingness to bear the slightest of discomforts, and our incessant selfishness has and will continue to make this more painful than it ever needed to be."
25908,"Individually, none of us deserved this."
25909,"Societally, it is exactly what we get."
25910,"Not to mention the US is a very obese nation, which is a comorbidity for covid."
25911,"The North American attitude is “if it doesn’t affect me, it doesn’t matter.” The number of people who don’t think like that is overshadowed by those who do"
25912,What about when he said it was safe to go on cruises?
25913,That one backfired.
25914,I wonder what new nursery rhyme will they write for covid19
25915,I was just chatting with some friends about this tonight.
25916,People are like toddlers that lack any concept of object permanence.
25917,Don’t see Thanksgiving this year?
25918,Is gone forever??
25919,"No dude,  It’s OK, it’ll roll around again next year"
25920,"if the sample's demographics are representative, 1,235 is just fine, more than enough even, as a sample size for almost any country."
25921,"past a certain population size, increasing the sample size gives almost no returns in terms of accuracy benefit/cost"
25922,Not shocking for anyone who lives here.
25923,Too many red hats who refuse to follow the mask and social distance orders and the worthless tourists who won’t stay the fuck home.
25924,"Sorry your home state is a shithole, but we don’t need you here until this is over."
25925,Actually two of my medicines.may help..
25926,"I like to analogize a driver in the rain, or at night, in traffic, without their lights on."
25927,"All the other head and street lights are illuminating the path, why then use your headlights?"
25928,"I could imagine a similar response, had driving without headlights been allowed all these years, and now the governments are requiring headlights."
25929,I’d argue there would be people who refuse.
25930,I’d also argue the same people would be unwilling to follow mask mandates.
25931,"It requires you to think outside of yourself, a trait we all need work on."
25932,And proud to be an Australian after you saw SA totally willing to do the same thing.
25933,My brother had a ginormous birthday party today (50+ in an enclosed space for 4+ hours).
25934,No one social distancing or wearing masks.
25935,"It boggles the mind that many people, including those currently in hospital, continue to deny the deadly nature of the disease."
25936,Can someone explain how the military is supposed to deliver the vaccines.
25937,Is the military going to Pfizer and picking the vaccine in their HUMVEE'S and MRAPS then deliver the vaccines to hospitals that have the required cold chain to maintain the temperature of the vaccine.
25938,Or is the military contracting with FEDEX and UPS to deliver vaccines to the hospitals and health centers across the USA.
25939,"Well, it could have very well lasted for opposite reasons."
25940,"If covid happened in 1920s, my 2 cents on it passing faster than spanish flu."
25941,But present day scenario is different.
25942,"Because of media and social media, there was a fear in general public, forcing them to shut down, and government subsequently shutting down, which obviously was a good thing."
25943,"Also people had confidence of developing vaccines a lot faster, so with benefit of hindsight, locking down in march was not such a bad move"
25944,Might be a support unit the regular army has mobile conex coolers not really designed for morgue use though.
25945,Oh ya I'm genuinely worried about the mental health of friends I have living solo in single apartments.
25946,That's good of u to at least offer that.
25947,Street food is hard to be profitable in suburban and rural areas.
25948,They had billions of dollars thrown at them to allow them to proceed at the speed of light.
25949,"It takes meny to do this research, lots of money."
25950,Physicians basically can never strike.
25951,This was my concern.
25952,We had our chance to develop and produce rapid tests back in April but the plan got scrapped.
25953,"Are they going to quarantine everyone that tests positive, even if that approaches 50% of the tests?"
25954,Some restaurants here have transitioned to mostly takeout with some sit-down ok.
25955,Problem is restaurant may survive but they currently don't need full wait staff or dishwashers etc if inside dining was fully open.
25956,Kill the economy and do nothing to stop the pandemic!
25957,Now that's efficiency!
25958,It's so bad it was in the news... Several pictures
25959,So this chart is purely politicising the virus and shows the maker's political affirmation to the dems
25960,"They are very conservative, sure, but that is a consistent trend with most of East Asia."
25961,Japan’s working culture is notorious in the west but then so is that of most east Asia.
25962,But their citizens still vote for their leaders.
25963,Democratic governance does not automatically engender a significant change in culture.
25964,These people don't actually care.
25965,They only care because THEY are affected.
25966,"Once they get back on their feet they will go back to being selfish, uncaring people."
25967,"Yeah that's why I said the problem is not about education, because that's present in good amount."
25968,"The problem is this active opposition to even the most established basic facts, like about the earth being round and vaccination."
25969,"Apart from the country being well off and believing in conspiracies in free time, I think there must also be some heavy money being poured into scientists and doctors who'd take opposing stances."
25970,Don't know what they'll benefit from things like this though.
25971,"Why in God’s name are people INSISTING on going to see loved ones, when they could be carrying a loaded metaphorical bomb?!"
25972,You know we have to see WONDERFUL inventions called PHONES.
25973,"That can not only make voice calls, but you can now make VIDEO calls where you can actually see your loved ones without infecting them."
25974,Maybe I’m just stupid.
25975,Maybe I’m an unfeeling beast.
25976,But I would gladly skip ONE holiday to have a chance at 20-30 more.

26034,Oh and the part where people are willing to get tested and it looks frowned by others if you deny testing.
26035,"You know, cause it’s the exact opposite of here where if you don’t wear a mask and deny the virus exists then you are the steward of American freedom, riding on the back of a flying bald eagle and putting it all in the face of the libtards, George Soros, and the media and Trump is the second coming of Jesus."

26085,Where do you live that you can’t go to a grocery store with your wife?!?
26086,"From my (layman’s) understanding, grocery store shopping isn’t super high risk, owing to the size of stores being large, and the length of time people spend near strangers being small (this assumes universal masking is in place)."

26132,The east also had governments help their citizens out.

26138,9/11 was a tragedy.
26139,COVID is one of many illnesses that people die from.
26140,Death is always sad but dying from an illness is a little less “tragic” than dying from a terrorist attack or murder.
26141,Because MABs are really not that useful in a widespread epidemic like this.
26142,"They are at their most effective when given early on - but the production process is slow and involved enough that it's impractical to produce them in large enough volumes so that everyone has access to them (especially if you have &gt; 100,000 cases a day) - if you hold off to save them for serious cases then they become much less effective."
26143,"So in practice the only people that will end up getting them are politicians, sportsmen, business people with lots of money and friends of Donald Trump - great for them individually, but honestly not a major contribution to public health."
26144,Weird.

26160,Internet person - school is ~5.5 hours.
26161,Who do you know who works less than 5.5 hours a day?
26162,"People need time to get to and from work to drop off pick up their kids..

Do a few people PAY a lot of money so their kids can stay before and after school, yes."
26163,People also pay money to nannies/babysitters/other organized programs to pick their kids up from school and watch them after school.
26164,"Often the after and before school programs are not on campus, but at nearby YMCAs and Boys and Girls clubs instead."
26165,Obviously you don’t have kids that go to school or else you would know all of this!
26166,You are making a bunch of assumptions that are not true.
26167,"Risk of dying onboard a Delta 737NG flight from Chicago to St Louis:  1 in 8487941 (source:  “amigoingdown” app)

Risk of at least one person at a ten person gathering in St Louis being infected with COVID:  22% (roughly 1 in 5)."
26168,"Source:  https://covid19risk.biosci.gatech.edu

Risk of acquiring COVID at that gathering:  unknown, but if everyone is in the same unventilated room not wearing masks and socializing around a thanksgiving meal for twelve hours... high."
26169,Let’s say 1 in 10.
26170,"Risk of being symptomatic enough that you test positive so you are counted in the case numbers:  estimates vary on this, but 1 in 5 is common."

26246,We're not expecting anything like this to occur.
26247,"The spike protein that is being targeted isn't found in the human body, so there is minimal chance of autoimmunity."

26287,"You realize they will only release the OFFICIAL rollout plan post approval, right?"
26288,"Also, having enough vaccines for the ENTIRE population (for every Joe and Sally who want one) and living a restriction-less summer are two different sentiments, right?"

26290,I think you are absolutely right.
26291,The trick is to not be optimistic or pessimistic; just neutral.
26292,As all things should be.
26293,I understand how research works and how vax are developed and am aware of the role of MERS/SARS research here and definitely feel there is more inherent risk to this vaccine than others subject to standard regulation and approval protocol.

26323,And then go back to normal.
26324,You're seeing the same thing in the restaurant industry.
26325,Most places are phasing out everything that doesn't sell at least 10-15% of plates a night.
26326,"Fast food and fast casual are doing it, too (cries in Taco Bell getting rid of potatoes)."

26329,Could you imagine Reddit’s reaction if COVID had originated from the US...?
26330,Redditors would be LIVID and this entire website would become one giant ‘America Bad’ echo chamber (much more so than it already is).
26331,"But when it comes to China, these sorts of articles are posted about how they didn’t fuck up at the beginning and how everyone around the world should just accept whatever they say regarding the timeline of critical information being released about COVID..."
26332,I don’t believe the CCP and this article is complete bullshit.
26333,Vietnam runs authoritarian covid prevention that is successful if the government has absolute physical control of people.

26341,"There are poorer people, as you say."
26342,"But then again, many of them are not living in a warzone, so why help them when there are those less fortunate?"
26343,But those living in warzones may not be in active fear of death.
26344,"But those living in fear may not be actively dying, so let's not concern ourselves with them."
26345,But those actively dying may not be living in excruciating pain.
26346,"But how do we determine who is most in pain at any moment, since we should only be concerned about those who are suffering the most?"
26347,The rest are just an afterthought.
26348,Victoria's lockdown sucked.
26349,And I am proud of my fellow Victorians for pulling through.
26350,Non-Victorian Australians did not go through lockdown.
26351,"They have their problems, but they did no go through our lockdown."
26352,"When I talk about our lockdown in a coronavirus-related, that's not to diminish the suffering of others."
26353,People go through worse fates than a lockdown.
26354,But it's nearly certain there are some suffering worse than any of those people.
26355,Everyone suffers.
26356,It's not a competition.
26357,"Personally, I got through lockdown better than most."
26358,I also know it was an entirely Victorian endeavour.
26359,South Australians went through a 3-day lockdown.
26360,That probably was tough too.
26361,I'm not going to tell them that their lockdown was nothing.
26362,"BUT if they do have the audacity to act as if our lockdowns are in any way similar,  then I will calmly but firmly tell them they're wrong."
26363,That's not to say that they didn't have problems.
26364,It's to say our problems shouldn't be diminished.
26365,I most likely had the moderna vaccine.
26366,I’m in the phase 3 trial.
26367,"I felt pretty blah for about a day, but my front hasn’t fallen off yet."
26368,Given how out of control this virus is about to get I’m actually worried about you guys more than me.
26369,"How, as we know and understand things right now, is it that wearing a mask isn't the same law as wearing a seat belt?"
26370,And a seat belt only protects yourself.
26371,A mask does both.
26372,This cannot be a suggestion anymore.
26373,The only question would be do you give the person or the place of business a fine?
26374,"""No mask, no service""  should be a policy in every business that is indoors."
26375,"My state has had a mask mandate for quite awhile and we’ve dodged big surges until recently; my town of 18,000 has 134 infections for instance."
26376,Today there was an announcement that 17 new cases are within our local county sheriff’s department.
26377,"None of those cops wear masks, but their supporters wear Thin Blue Line ones."
26378,It is weird.
26379,You’d think they’d jump at the opportunity to wear that and not just have it on their vehicles.
26380,Why do people always use Worldometer instead of 1point3acres?
26381,1point3acres has such a better layout and you don't have to go to multiple pages to see the info
26382,now all we need to do is make them.
26383,Remember when we used to be worried about mass shooters?
26384,One person coughing and taking off their mask to breath can be just as bad.
26385,This was in Trump-entrenched South Carolina.
26386,"I live in California, where most of us know better."
26387,I’m not a covid denialist.
26388,I take it very seriously and remind my family to do so also.
26389,at the same time I don’t buy into the idea that we will never overcome this like so many do.
26390,Thanks for your super valuable and insightful contribution!

26395,"Yeah I agree with you, the numbers are under counted."
26396,"I do however understand the universities stance where they don't want to report a number in their population when the student isn't technically a resident of that town, I can totally see why the decision was made that way, because they don't want to double count."
26397,I don't really agree with that decision though.
26398,People who live there should know the numbers of infected I thier community
26399,fuck
26400,"Eh, I'll plan later so I don't have to panic later later."
26401,"Yeah, no shit."
26402,These people are disturbed in some way.
26403,"Let me educate you, friend."
26404,The Wuhan government tried to silence the doctor and downplay the virus.
26405,When the CCP found out they fired the local leaders and swooped in with the army to control the situation.
26406,If you are upset about the doctor then you should be happy with the CCPs response.

26472,In the US there was a huge innate resistance among people of all political stripes.
26473,It's forgotten now but in the beginning the response to someone wearing a mask in public was to scorn them for taking PPE from a healthcare worker.

i mean the true infection rate will still likely end up around that mark?"
26482,just some back of the envelope math indicates 261k deaths at a 0.5% true fatality rate would mean around 50m infections the US so far.
26483,maybe that's a bit on the high side but this ain't over yet

26529,The only thing I would rule out is malice - I would rather think some laboratories are over-cautious and are worried about smaller amounts of viral material (and the consequence) than others.
26530,"Good 

You're saving their lives"
26531,The problem is that a decent amount of them either 1) think the virus is overblown or 2) firmly believe masks do absolutely nothing and they're being tricked for some reason.

26535,Australia and NZ are huge islands in the middle of nowhere with very few people and no land borders.
26536,You can't even begin to compare thekr challenges with that of a central European country
26537,Neither of those countries have a population anywhere near the US.
26538,"Also, I’m tired of the NZ example bc it’s a tiny, isolated island with a population the size of ONE US city...of course it’s so much easier to control a virus over there"
26539,thank god the beef is safe....

26541,Only us Victorians had a second wave.
26542,"The rest has been pretty much covid free since June, barring the odd small cluster here and there in Sydney and one just now in Adelaide."
26543,So if you don't have any corona to beat back its very hard to create any headlines.
26544,All states did very well in the first wave though... Got it down to virtually zero everywhere.
26545,Victoria's second wave was caused to leaked quarantine issues.

27078,They’ve all been breaches in quarantine caused by staff
27079,[deleted]
27080,Was it worth it?
27081,"Can’t you also buy supplemental insurance in Canada, or pay out of pocket for private care?"
27082,"Kind of the best of both worlds... if you can afford the luxury of faster non-essential care, then great, if not, you wait in line like the rest of the people."
27083,As for how our private insurance works... goooood fucking luck.
27084,"You do realize that if you’re not employee, you get ZERO insurance?"
27085,"And even if you are employed, they can offer whatever insurance they want for you."
27086,"Meaning it could be total dog shit that you pay ~300/mo for, and when you need medical care, you pay another $6000 before insurance actually kicks in."
27087,Does that mean you’ll gladly pay more in health care premiums and taxes for all of those people who end up with long-term side effects?
27088,🤔
27089,Honestly... A lottery once we get to general distribution seems less painful than whatever chaotic crap we seem on track for.
27090,I've got an ugly feeling it's going to be organized for medical workers and assisted living and then some jackass will flip a switch and we'll all be left scrambling like we are for Flu vaccines in Ontario.
27091,"If i, as a mechanic, would probably go to jail if I let you leave with a knowingly deadly vehicle, why cant we arrest these business owners?"
27092,They know its deadly and still choose profit
27093,That's really interesting.
27094,"Its good that the masks offer some protection, though you wish it was more, but I guess what they originally said, about them more being used to prevent you from infecting others is the real reason to wear one."
27095,Thanks for the explanation.
27096,"People are just going to drive this year , never fear thanksgiving is still on ."
27097,That means I don't have to work in the same space as the germ factories.
27098,Works for me
27099,I think my empathy is dead forever after all of this.

27101,"Children under 12 don't seem to get sick as often, so there's not as much of a need to vaccinate them."
27102,"I did see they're doing vaccine trials for children 12 and older though, who are more likely to get sick."
27103,"For the record, I'm not saying children under 12 never get sick or don't spread COVID."
27104,Reopening schools was a bad idea.
27105,"I'm the kind of person who actively avoids news and current events, and I've been tallying numbers in a spreadsheet daily since March (locally, nationally, and globally)."
27106,The pandemic was the one thing that was able to get me to start watching the local news (although I ragequit when they ran a segment telling people they were wearing their masks *too much*).
27107,This is a pandemic.
27108,These are not normal circumstances.
27109,Normal rules do not apply.
27110,"I'm not sick of hearing it, I'm sick of people sensationalized it by drawing attention to records being broken."
27111,I'm in no way trying to downplay the tradgey of the situation.
27112,I just think news outlets are stupid for telling us we're a day older than we were yesterday.
27113,"True but if the virus has started in Vietnam, how would the numbers look?"
27114,That happened in how many asian countries?
27115,Albertsons has the same deal.
27116,I got my turkey at Smith's (Kroger's) for 47 cents a pound.

27123,The sheer ignorance of it all is appalling.
27124,You don't seem to understand what I'm saying.
27125,"It's irrelevant how dense the individual cities are, the fact is that there are thousands of miles between large cities, and oceans around the country."
27126,It's infinitely easier to contain a virus with this geographical situation.
27127,It's infinitely more difficult to contain a virus in countries with land borders and cities with large amounts of physical interaction.
27128,"Of course, *some* people may live in Sydney and work in Melbourne but the will be in the absolute minority."
27129,Many people however live in one city in France and work in another.
27130,It was possible to close Victoria because it's almost entirely self contained.
27131,"People largely don't need to travel from Victoria to South Australia daily, and those who do can be kept at home and supported economically by the open states."
27132,Take Queensland for example.
27133,"With an outbreak there, you could cut off the whole state and it could be supported economically by the rest of Australia."
27134,"I'm not saying Australia didn't do a good job, I'm saying that they had it far easier than Europe"
27135,Well of course it won't end it.
27136,It's not a cure.
27137,"Come on now, we would only invade Chad if we had evidence that Myanmar was behind all of this"
27138,&gt; You can have holidays alone or funerals for family.

27140,"Nah, credit should be given where it's due."
27141,"For one, India has a MUCH younger population."
27142,Germany was not that proactive either.
27143,"And yes there is NZ, but Vietnam, Taiwan, Thailand, Cambodia and Laos have done better."
27144,Just look at how many people have died in NZ per capita compared to those countries.
27145,"And this whole ""other factors"" you keep bringing up is probably that most of those countries I mentioned dealt with SARS and learned from it."
27146,Cambodia and Vietnam in particular had excellent systems in place.
27147,Moaners stuck on repeat.
27148,"You have a point, and there's a part of it that feels wrong, but I don't want the hateful anti mask idiots to be the first beneficiaries of these vaccines."

27158,Just two?
27159,"I thought this was something we'd have to get regularly, like 3 or 6 months, depending on the vaccine."
27160,Sounds like a bargain given the potential benefits.
27161,"My cousin is in Korea; she said that she’s getting a lot of text alerts over this, and that people are fine ~$80 for not wearing mask in public."
27162,"Meanwhile in the US, I have friends that claim masks don’t work and public health measures violate their right."
27163,&gt; Covid has really just rubbed our noses in all the ways we've been doing it wrong.
27164,"Now our future relies on telling the most overworked, underpaid, and just demoralized people to sit in a beige box and stare at the wall for a few months."
27165,"Oh, and you're not even going to get any help while you do it."
27166,WELCOME TO CAPATALISM
27167,"That's kind of the point though, what other reasons than saving the economy would you use to not lock down?"
27168,Sweden still fared marginally worse than Denmark who like Sweden has no piggie bank to draw from... Piggie bank or not you can still borrow or quatatively ease to stimulate the economy during covid...
27169,Which Sweden did.
27170,Tell them NO because you love them and Fauci says not to get together.
27171,They should not get together either.
27172,No!
27173,!
27174,Exactly.
27175,Or they could've isolated themselves in the lead up to thanksgiving.
27176,Or wankers who simply refuse to believe shit's as bad as it is
27177,"""hey its either 9 months or you cease to live, pick one"""
27178,They do.
27179,"I was thrown around by doctors (primary care, neurologist, pain management) for over a year before I did my own research and demanded to see a rheumatologist."
27180,"She diagnosed my condition in the first visit, officially after some imaging and lab work."
27181,And that was fast compared to most people who end up waiting 10 years from the onset of symptoms to diagnosis for ankylosing spondylitis.
27182,I too am hopeful that this may shed more light on autoimmune diseases and encourage more research in the field.
27183,As it stands.
27184,The drug manufactured have no incentive because they’re making hundreds of billions a year on the biologic drugs they prescribe to manage the symptoms.
27185,That’s the crux of the problem.
27186,"The actual order Nikolas gave was -
1."
27187,"Trial participants as a reward for risking their bacon for everyone else to have a vaccine

27189,3.
27190,After these 2 groups he said it was debatable and made the point about maybe vaccinating working age population first
27191,The USA is among the countries with the highest number of tests.
27192,Nearly 6 out of 10 people have been tested so far.
27193,The world isn't just.

27198,oh wow.
27199,thanks.
27200,&gt; Like were living it two different worlds.
27201,Because we are.
27202,Half this country has a faith-based belief system and the other half have a reality-based belief system.
27203,Trying to unify the country is a fool's errand.
27204,Bad headline.
27205,"As they head into phase 3, they said they expect it to be at least 60%."
27206,"Why have both WHO and CDC defected to ""No shit Sherlock"" news?"
27207,"Do we know everything about this virus now, that they are spending their time and money reiterating things from March/April?"
27208,"Basically be a good productive member of society and pay lots of taxes, but just don't try to have any fun."
27209,The line in the UK is that anything goes if it's for work.
27210,China has a higher population then India yet has only 4.6k deaths.
27211,Everybody here defending the west's approach only prove the point.
27212,"As someone living in Germany I can only say yes, they do better then most other european countries but still very poor compared to east Asia."
27213,New deaths in germany are again on the rise.
27214,One thing of looking at this is not only deaths but  also how is life moving on in the west vs east Asia.
27215,Where in China there is close to no restrictions in Europe almost every country is in lockdown again.
27216,If we had a lawyer we probably would have done much better than with the media personality we have.
27217,"Correlation is not causation, and this is certainly not a randomised trial."
27218,"It just means that some counties have found effective measures, and others have not."
27219,"Face masks may be a cause, or they may be an indicator or both."
27220,Good luck USA.
27221,I can’t see how it won’t get worse.
27222,Really worse.
27223,Mid December stats are going to be insane.
27224,Hope I’m wrong.
27225,You are assuming that most of the elderly are all in nursing homes or at home unable to take care of themselves.
27226,The elderly are usually 60-65+ which means they come into the contact with the same people everyone else does.
27227,That's why it makes more sense to have the elderly vaccinated first.
27228,"Well, I’m european so I’ve seem the US make all kind of weird claims about possible medications in the last year."
27229,Not that impressed.
27230,And vaccines seem 95% effective at less than 50 USD apiece.
27231,So way better than this medication (small survival benefit or something).
27232,The owners of this country don't give a fuck about the people at all.
27233,"Wait are you telling me that masks don’t work when governments also open schools, promote EU tourism, allow bars and clubs where no one wears masks?"
27234,It’s almost like several measures are needed to successfully fight this virus.
27235,"When I read the comments here I’m not surprised why the pandemic situation is so bad in many western countries, people and governments there are totally clueless!"
27236,I wonder if East Asians look at the West and wonder “Why is it so difficult for them?”
27237,about 331 million people
27238,&gt;something deeper is going on.
27239,Government competence.
27240,"Nothing to do with political leaning, ideology or economic systems."
27241,"Authoritarian countries can be run well (or badly), just like liberal democracies."
27242,"Capitalism, or democracy, or communism or whatever had nothing to do with how competent a government is."
27243,How many deaths is acceptable to you?
27244,MORE BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD
27245,Yooo they’re paying people $27/hr and up to bury bodies
27246,&gt;I owned only one car in my family our entire life.
27247,My car is ten years old.
27248,I have the oldest car in my friend group.
27249,"Even when I was working retail, ALL of my co-workers had brand new cars."
27250,"Yes, wages are lower now."
27251,But so many people are terrible with money.
27252,People are downvoting you because what you are saying is not want they want to hear.
27253,But has your landscaping cousin been inside?
27254,Has he seen the ICU or ER?
27255,Our hospital looked quiet during the covid surge.
27256,"Visitors were not allowed in, out patient procedures were halted, and the general “my knee has hurt for 8 months” bullshit stopped coming to the ER."
27257,"However, our ICU, which was originally 12 rooms, went to 36 rooms, and most everyone was intubated."
27258,It was pure chaos and hell up there.
27259,"I worked in the ER and the “dirty” areas, where covid patients or possible covid patients were being seen, was also hell."
27260,"But the generally areas for non-covid people, were pretty much empty."
27261,"This ""work hard strike it lucky fortune"" mindset was a common stereotype of poor European immigrants prior to WW1 and seems to have embedded itself into the culture."
27262,What part of New Zealand are you planning on moving to?
27263,People are probably downvoting you because there is a tendency here for people to fall into two distinct camps (just like our political divisiveness).
27264,"""LOCK DOWN EVERYTHING vs IT'S JUST A FLU WE DONT NEED TO DO ANYTHING!!"""
27265,You're 100% right that the government aint doing shit for us and so businesses are going to flout rules and fight back against restrictions because we're not getting bailed out (I have a small gym business that I've moved to house visits and online).
27266,Arguing for harsh lockdowns would be absolutely the way to go if the government would actually fucking help us.
27267,Although Ive pivoted my business model many others cannot so it's not much wonder if they're not getting shit for unemployment insurance that's they're staying open.
27268,Yep I'm sure this plays a huge part.
27269,"But redditors don't have social lives and always love hating on people that have fun, this is just another way to do it."
27270,".... electricity,sewer,garbage,hospitals....the world can't shut down ."
27271,You would kill more then covid ever could
27272,American here.
27273,Propagandist will have you believe that Conservatives are the problem but then you look at florida which was staunchly red and very dense in population isn't having surge in cases.
27274,Don't let bots make this a decisive issue about left vs right.
27275,They are talking out their ass when they blame a political party.
27276,In the US it is States responsibility to put measures in place.
27277,"Deaths fall on the state level, no t the federal one."
27278,Unless they are ready to deliver 300 million then no there aren’t enough ready
27279,I don’t care which one I get but I would prefer the most effective and safest.
27280,I think that one will win.
27281,"If they are all similar, I want the one I can get the fastest."
27282,[removed]
27283,Well I mean seems like a lot of people I’ve spoken to recently think the suggestion to not do thanksgiving is oppression and *”the guv’ments not gunna stop me from having thanksgiving”* I can see why there’s not been a significant reduction.
27284,"Darwin, you never cease to amaze."
27285,"Always have been 

🌎👨‍🚀🔫👨‍🚀"
27286,Because killing that annoying little brat of a cousin was only a pipe dream of thanksgivings past.
27287,"This year, it is on."
27288,"Typical attitude to try to win an argument by describing *who I am* as a person by calling me ""touchy and defeatist"" and decided I ""am helpless."""
27289,"I can't wait until that's not a thing anymore, it's really distracting and makes it impossible for the other person to even hear what you're saying."
27290,"If you stop immediately attacking people's character and telling them*what they are* and using mocking language, (even regarding yourself) like ""boohoo"" you would be surprised how much more people listen."
27291,You don't think they are going to vaccinate the people administering the vaccines *first*?
27292,"There absolutely will be issues if things are too out of control when it comes time to vaccinate, but I doubt this is one of them..."
27293,"&gt; Am I the idiot

I believe it was Fauci who said at the start of this pandemic something like ""The measures we take will seem extreme at the time but will seem like not enough afterwards""."
27294,When someone who has spent their lifetime studying and worrying about pandemics says something like that it's worth listening to IMO.
27295,Way too many people also didn't understand that the first 7 months of this didn't represent what the worst could look like - the low death rate has only been because we've been able to maintain the healthcare system.
27296,It's been like large waves hitting a beach but now we've got a tsunami coming in.
27297,Isn't that (imported frozen food) the best guess New Zealand came up with for their new cases about 2 months ago?
27298,You’re thinking of Clearwater lol.
27299,Opposite coast
27300,These people are all about to hop on airplanes too.
27301,"Florida hospitalizations seem relatively low, though?"
27302,Better than some northeast states even.
27303,"These are all young people, the problem arises if/when they interact with at risk individuals."
27304,"Uh no, because no one is misinforming anyone, you just didn’t read the title of the article properly."
27305,Just like those who support lockdowns don't care about the children dying in Africa thanks to the negative economic impact of the lockdowners' selfishness.
27306,https://data.unicef.org/covid-19-and-children/
27307,I agree.
27308,Have a great week!
27309,/r/unexpectedthanos
27310,I’m just likely to wear masks quite frequently.
27311,"No one can see my mouth, but I’m not sure that hurts me in any way at all."
27312,Human nature.
27313,What would've thought?
27314,Goodbye
27315,"Yep, I know a bunch of people who are still in college would do a weekend trip to cities and bars that were opened so they can party."
27316,And then this one girl took her friends on a plane to Las Vegas to celebrate her birthday this past weekend
27317,"Particularly in cases where people die in their homes and haven’t ever been tested or been to the hospital, these may not be counted as Covid deaths if they aren’t investigated."
27318,"Probably every county has a different approach to these cases, some would do blood work some would do an autopsy but many would be simply marked as unknown cause or something else."
27319,"After this whole shit is over (if it ever ends), there really needs to be an audit of companies and their behavior during this."
27320,There needs to be consequences for the blatant disregard of human life.
27321,Have you found something new yet?
27322,"I think he also had the flu, so..."
27323,Just go get the virus and you won’t get it again.
27324,My whole family has already had it.
27325,Only 4 people globally have gotten it twice and they’ve all been asymptotic the second time.
27326,Don’t let fear ruin your life.
27327,I’m the biggest bernie gal there ever was so he is painfully inaccurate lol
27328,Fuck.
27329,Off.
27330,With.
27331,That.
27332,Shit.
27333,Fucking vampires looking for blood at every turn.
27334,This isn’t a fucking Botox shot it’s a potentially life saving medicine in a global fucking health crisis.
27335,Miss me with that money shit.
27336,Hand that fucking shit out and save lives.
27337,Fuck your profits
27338,But “sitting in a beige wall for months” isn’t what’s being asked of people though.
27339,At least not anymore.
27340,"The message since at least May has consistently been “wear a mask, socially distance, and eat/drink outdoors” and getting people to do that has been incredibly difficult."
27341,"While I definitely agree that Covid has shone a harsh light on wealth disparity in the US, it has also shone a harsh light on how selfish people can be."
27342,The “surge” I read about last week was still about 40% of a normal Thanksgiving.
27343,And many of those Traveler’s were kids coming back from colleges that are going remote.
27344,It’s not exactly back up the system.
27345,"Do you have any idea how many expats visit hospitals every day, and do video calls with their relatives over here later?"
27346,All corrupted?
27347,Is Florida doing worse than the average state right now?
27348,Not every problem is significant enough to warrant mandates with such sweeping social disruption.
27349,"If you had to guess, how long do you think it would take for this pandemic to exact the same toll in terms of loss of life on a population-adjusted level as the Spanish Flu?"
27350,"Yes, there is, from lots of different angles and it all converges around 5-10x undercount."
27351,Such evidece includes ratios of confirmed covid cases to positive antibody results.
27352,E.g.
27353,"NYC has 300k confirmed covid cases yet 25% of it's 8.5 million are antibody positive, so about 2.1 million infections or 7x more than confirmed cases."
27354,You get similar numbers comparing case mortality rates to many studies looking at infection fatality rate.
27355,"The US case mortality rate currently stands at 2.3%, but latest WHO paper from October estimates INFECTION (NOT CONFIRMED CASE) fatality rates at 0.23%, again pointing to a 10x factor of undercounting."
27356,Care to share your evidence or at least reasoning against it?

27358,We had our son out of his school from March all the way to September...

27361,1 in 25 in Fl *waves*
27362,This comment section is a mess.
27363,"No, but we have terrible public transportation, and low pop density."
27364,So much of the country could probably prevent catastrophic spread with only a few significant measures in place.
27365,Driving is a privilege not a right
27366,"With how bad the government has been at messaging throughout this, I don't want them coming up with anything."
27367,"Trump’s rich friends have no incentive to help people losing their apartments, and have every incentive for poor people to stop spreading this shit so the upper middle class feel safe to spend money in the economy again."
27368,Vaccinating everyone willing to get jabbed will absolutely happen.
27369,"All the people who survived Covid:  ""See, it isn't deadly!"""

27395,"Hoping for the former, expecting the expecting the latter."
27396,Reinfection is possible.
27397,We currently don't have enough data to know if reinfection is rare or common.
27398,"Because of the high standards to determine, and lack of measures taken to accurately view the criteria, (like lack of testing early on, infrequency of sequencing genomes, etc) we likely won't know how common or uncommon it is for a long time."
27399,"We also don't know how common resurgences are, and these are proven as well."
27400,Meaning you could be infectious weeks or months after having tested negative.
27401,Immunity is variable.
27402,This isn't sterilized immunity.
27403,You are always susceptible to getting it again.
27404,We just don't know the timeline or frequency of that.

27412,"To be fair my drinking and drug use is off the charts this year compared to every other year of my life , I do just drink and get high on my couch now though."
27413,Pre-pandemic we always bought the big packs (24 or 32 packs depending on the store) and just didn’t buy it often.
27414,It’s usually (but not always!)
27415,a better value.
27416,Now I’m buying 4-packs every week and it’s more annoying because if they’re out one week we’re actually risking running out.
27417,"Whatever, just bring them on, I don't care at this point."
27418,Look.
27419,"My husband and I fly every week (we are long distance) , even through COVID."
27420,That's 50+ flights since COVID.
27421,Wet have not caught COVID.
27422,"Just add my one anecdote doesn't mean you won't get COVID if you fly, your one anecdote doesn't mean that you certainly will get COVID if you fly."
27423,"I take precautions and we isolate as best we can (no dinners, minimal shopping trips, make, hand washing, etc) but I am not going to be apart from my husband for who knows how long, I am not going to ask him to be apart from his kids and he's not going to ask me to be apart from my son (we live apart due to where it children currently live, long story)."

27432,My wife's work usually has flu shots brought in free for all company employees.
27433,Not sure if they did that again as we already got ours but they are doing weekly covid testing for all employees so they take this pretty seriously
27434,"Yeah, but you’re ignoring the tragedy of the commons aspect of this."
27435,"So if you get sick and need to go to the hospital, don’t go."
27436,And everyone you get sick shouldn’t go either.
27437,Obviously this doesn’t work which is why you 100% need a top down approach for a pandemic.
27438,People don’t seem to be capable of calculating and assessing second and third order effects.

27480,In fact contact exposure is very limited.
27481,Mostly has to be transferred directly.

27525,Just had ours 4 days ago in MN and all rooms were full
27526,Leave Canada out of this please
27527,[deleted]
27528,Ignorance is bliss
27529,Think of the hospitals and our healthcare workers you pieces of shit!
27530,I don’t think wide scale vaccination of the public will start until spring 2021.
27531,Only a relatively few people will get the first dose of the vaccine in December and I wouldn’t expect them to have protective immunity until sometime in January at the earliest.
27532,The logistics of getting hundreds of millions of doses of vaccines (which require -70 F {Pfizer} or even -7  F {Moderna}) are incredibly challenging.
27533,Do I think hospitals and research universities/institutions can figure it out - yes.
27534,"I’m not so sure about drug stores, grocery stores, county health offices, doctor’s offices and other places people usually get vaccines at."
27535,Those are extreme sub zero temperatures - most businesses do not have massive scale cryogenic storage.
27536,I suspect the Jansen and Astra Zeneca vaccines (if approved by early next year) may end up being the vaccine of choice since they don’t require the extreme cold that the RNA vaccines do.
27537,I bet those people are the happiest though.
27538,I would argue 99% of the news isn’t going to affect you much.
27539,"Obviously that 1% is probably important, but it’s important enough that you will hear about it from some other means."
27540,But I’d also argue 99% of social media is pretty worthless too.
27541,Who would look after your dog if you died??
27542,Another reason to stay home.
27543,I used to work in a rural hospital.
27544,"4 ICU beds, the only hospital within a 50 mile radius."
27545,"Nearest major center 7 hours away by ambulance on bad roads, helicopter service frequently unavailable due to weather conditions."
27546,"On a very good day (pre covid), one or two ICU beds would be occupied."
27547,"Traumatic brain injuries, sepsis, post-op cases, the usual."
27548,"On a not so good day, all four would be occupied."
27549,"On a bad day we would have more patients than ICU beds and I would spend precious hours desperately trying to arrange transport to either the major center or one of the other rural hospitals 2-3 hours away, all while they steadily deteriorated in front of us."
27550,"On the absolute worst days, none of the other hospitals would have beds available either, and there was nowhere to send them."
27551,"We would have to explain to their panicking families what was going on, and that we just had to do the best we could in a regular ward setting until we could find them an ICU bed."
27552,"Many of them didn't make it, and I will never stop wondering if there was anything else at all I could have done for them."
27553,And this was before a pandemic.
27554,Now put covid into this picture.
27555,"This, as I said in a previous comment, is not going to be pretty."
27556,You’re fucking retarded and part of the reason why The US is heading into civil war
27557,There’s no reason other developed countries places can’t do what Victoria did (noting Victoria  was the only place within Australia that locked down that hard since it had the worst outbreak - it wasn’t the whole country).
27558,I don’t get why people think it’s so difficult.
27559,Just stay home.
27560,Relax.
27561,"Hell, for a lot of people it’s a nice break from work."
27562,Note that you obviously have to do this in combination with government paying people’s income and ensuring their jobs are safe.
27563,I think *thats* why Americans think it’s impossible.
27564,"They’re missing that you have to have both sides of the coin: a well enforced lockdowns, and financial support so that people want to actually comply with the rules."
27565,Obviously no one is going to obey a lockdown if it means they can’t get food on the table or pay their rent.

27570,Performing brain surgery drunk is also dangerous.
27571,But what if smart-ass doctor guy says he's perfectly capable of driving and cutting your brains open after drinking a bottle of vodka?
27572,And the tricky part is that maybe he is.
27573,But will the next one be?
27574,Is that a personal choice?
27575,Do we only go after people doing reckless things *after* we can prove they harmed others?
27576,Or do we try to prevent it from happening?
27577,And what about situations where it's practically impossible to prove individual guilt?
27578,We know a party like that is very likely to spread the disease.
27579,"We know people who attended will then infect others in their families, workplaces, shops etc."
27580,"People who had no choice, no freedom at all."
27581,"When I get out of my house to buy groceries, I know there's a risk I'll catch COVID-19."
27582,But that's a calculated risk.
27583,"If I happen upon someone who was in a big party a week before, that risk is much greater."
27584,And I'll never be able to know or prove they were the ones who harmed me because of their negligence.
27585,"Now, maybe you're the most conscientious party-goer ever."
27586,Maybe you live next door to the club and only come in contact with other people who accepted that risk.
27587,But *we know* that's not the case for everyone.
27588,At some point it's just common sense.
27589,"Freedom is great, but people don't have a right to drive cars blindfolded."
27590,Like I get it.

27643,Does the UBI come with a catch that we have police presence checking on people's homes to make sure they are locked inside and are quarantining?
27644,That we're shutting the airlines and the roads down so these idiots don't travel all over the country to go to Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner?

27660,When did American public follow government advice?
27661,Exactly.
27662,Say they take the gamble and someone at Thanksgiving has the virus and spreads it around the family.
27663,It doesn't just affect the old folks who are ready and willing to die.
27664,Younger family members may end up with long term effects.
27665,Family members will later be going about their lives and exposing the public.
27666,"And then you know if an elderly family member gets sick, they're not necessarily going to just accept their chosen fate and die in isolation at home."
27667,They will probably seek medical attention when symptoms get bad and expose healthcare workers in the process.

Which is why we have required auto insurance, why paying taxes to fund the fire company isn't optional... who knew behaving properly during a pandemic would need to be regulated, too?"
27697,"Guys, I’m tired."
27698,I’m an icu nurse and my hospital has critical staffing shortages because nurses are getting sick from their family members.
27699,They are offering double time for every over time shift until 12/31.
27700,That NEVER happens.
27701,They’re super stingy with double time.
27702,It’s only going to get worse.

27737,"Well, virus numbers have been slightly on the rise lately here too, so let's see how long this lasts, but even if Japan is undercounting death rates by 10 times, we still have less deaths than Germany per capita which is hilarious (i.e."
27738,"Even if we x10 Japan's current death count, we would still have a slightly lower death per capita rate than Germany)"
27739,"No, we got a “midterm” rental through a realtor."
27740,"They had vacation rentals, “midterm rentals (3-6 months),” and long term rentals (like you would normally do if you simply lived somewhere)."
27741,"Because of the lack of travelers this year, the midterm rentals were like the long term rentals price wise and a lot cheaper than hotel or airbnb."
27742,Actually our own home rented out for slightly more than we were able to get a place for over there.

27779,The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.
27780,"Yet, here we are."
27781,You are still risking your life so people can get care.
27782,My mom was so thankful for the security staff at her hospital protecting her from unnecessary visitors who refused masks and tried to sneak in when visitors aren't allowed.
27783,"My heart breaks for everyone working in healthcare right now, the general public isn't putting in the same effort to keep them safe."

27825,Jesus fucking christ were closing in on 200k reported cases a day.
27826,The real number of cases is a lot god damn higher cause our testing capacity is still utter garbage.
27827,Everyone is fucking suffering this God damn year but a majority of Americans want to simply make it just about them and that is what is prolonging this bullshit.
27828,Its 100% selfish.
27829,What’s the per dollar cost of the vaccine?
27830,Is the Government going to make everyone get it?
27831,Should be free or at least 5 bucks so everyone can afford it.

27863,Maybe sit 15 feet apart or something a bit more generous.
27864,My man!
27865,We already know what to do if something like this happens again.
27866,Trump mismanaging this thing is literally solely to blame for where we are...and most of Europe.

27870,I think the soldiers are living under heightened circumstances that are actually not at all similar or close to the levels of daily stress etc that we live in not in a war zone as soldiers during a world war.

27873,Don has definitely fanned the flames and has been a vanguard for the so called disenfranchised.

28395,"There is also no longer a proper contact tracing, so we probably don't catch all those mild cases because they don't know they have been exposed."
28396,And by reading other comments it is apparently also very difficult to get tested now if you had contact with an infected but have no simptoms.
28397,They will just tell you to quarantine and wait for simptoms to show.

28416,"He tested positive, I’m negative and both asymptomatic."
28417,Both were antigen lab tests (not rapid).
28418,It was a bummer to have to postpone our event since we feel fine but it’s a small comfort to realize we’re not the only ones dealing with the stress of upending thanksgiving.
28419,Can anyone relate?
28420,I would take it first as long as the FDA approved the data submitted.
28421,"I haven't seen the data on this yet, but they had to stop a trial of this drug in patients on oxygen with covid due to safety concerns."
28422,"I don't have any idea if the symptom improvements seen in outpatients is from a placebo controlled study or not, but the benefit that one gets from this drug does not seem to match the expense and harms that are potentially involved."
28423,"Reducing levels of virus in the blood doesn't tell me anything about how patients will do, and reducing hospital visits could be important, but only if both patients and doctors were bound in the study, which i would bet they were not."

28437,"I haven't been this scared since March, when people were saying ""most people are going to get this disease before it's over"", then we proceeded to see only a small fraction of the population represented in the numbers."
28438,"I know, that's still a LOT of people, and it doesn't represent everyone who got the disease, many of whom may have had mild cases or been asymptomatic."
28439,But the implication is that there is still so much more potential devastation to be wreaked.

28448,He’s been congested the past couple of days where it feels like allergies or maybe a cold so the doctor said unless there are more symptoms they don’t do a swab and send.

28496,The Oxford vaccine had pretty unimpressive results in the pre-clinical trials.
28497,Compare that to the Moderna/Biontech results that have exceeded all expectations.
28498,Oxford has had to halt their trial a couple times due to serious adverse reactions while the safety data from the Biontech trial appears to be fantastic.

28677,Are you saying that there are places that still are expecting this to just go away like SARS did?
28678,"All countries want herd immunity, we get there through vaccination (as Tegnell himself has said numerous times)."
28679,I will always refuse badly sources information.

28682,It’s pointless to argue with these people.
28683,They’re in an fear cult.
28684,"&gt;But it’s pretty clear you have a boner for western capitalism

If I had a boner for Western capitalism I'd be praising China which is the best example of ruthless capitalism you can find out there."
28685,This is understandable.
28686,Their patients are going to ask a lot of questions and the doctors and nurses are going to need to give answers.
28687,If there's data that can help convince people then they need that.
28688,We're not saying don't treat them.
28689,"But if there are two patients and you only have resources to treat one of them, priority should be given to the one who didn't run around screaming hoax while spreading the disease to others."
28690,A sort of triage.
28691,Would you be okay with alcoholics having equal priority for a liver transplant compared to someone who didn't cause their own liver failure?

28738,"November 26-27 - Tens of millions of morons get infected (Thanksgiving/Black Friday insanity)     
December 10 - Millions get sick     
December 15-20 - Hospitals overloaded    
December 25 - Deaths surpass the Civil War total (620k)         

Does that aound about right?"
28739,"Nah, because the best option in both cases is society washing their hands of these people."
28740,So nice to be a member of your club...
28741,I do agree.
28742,I can't upvote this enough.
28743,People are not following restrictions because Rona is not scary enough to force compliance.
28744,Every single person in that photo looks to be under 35.
28745,Covid isn't a threat to them.
28746,I wouldn't be comfortable in that situation but clearly there are many with a higher risk appetite than mine.
28747,No.
28748,It’s reality.
28749,What is asinine is to play pretend and just randomly claim that relief that isn’t coming is somehow coming and then acting as though that completely made up untruth is real by enacting rules and laws.
28750,America had it’s chance during the election to “get relief”.
28751,They voted against it.
28752,But you can't it spread it amongst your family.
28753,Your family is clean and hygienic!

28755,Call me crazy but spreading a pandemic level virus and harming one another sounds like a sin to me
28756,Gotta respect the thought you put into your arguments
28757,"Yea, Western countries have given up on COVID so badly that basically all of them are currently on lockdowns (althought not as severe as the ones in March and April)."
28758,"In my country, we are basically killing all the restaurant industry (which is fucking massive in terms of GDP contribution and jobs) and yet we have to deal with bullshit articles like this one saying the West has given up."
28759,you know how easy it is to stay the fuck away from an unmasked face?
28760,you know how easy it is to wash your hands?
28761,You know how easy it is to fuck off?
28762,Not free - paid for through taxes
28763,Has anyone looked into the idea that this is actually a very American expression of self-sabotage?
28764,"It’s like how we eat when we’re full, how we spend when we’re broke, how we date people we know are toxic... idk it’s just kind of occurring to me today."
28765,"On some level, I wonder if many of us don’t subconsciously *want* Covid to destroy us."
28766,Both on an individual and a society scale.
28767,&gt;Unfortunately people die from them and there’s nothing we can do about it.
28768,People are telling you what we can do about it.
28769,"People are asking you to do it, for the sake of others."
28770,"Your answer just amounts to ""I don't really care about other people."""

28772,I agree 100%
28773,Already closing in on 0.4 Spanish Flu.
28774,I figure we will get to 0.8 Spanish Flu by January or February.

28789,You were needlessly insulting because of internet anonymity.
28790,Did you want applause for your smooth brain statement?
28791,The government has botched this so horribly.
28792,Of course we will need to shut down some business due to the pandemic.
28793,But the the giver meant needs to step and and help those businesses and employees that are being shut down so they can survive until we get a vaccine.
28794,I think this restaurant owner is wrong for doing this but at the same time I can understand how they feel.
28795,Edit - typos

28809,I still have 3 pock marks on my face to this day.
28810,It would have absolutely been better to get it as a child than to go through what I did.

28831,"I don’t see how that’s any more dangerous than going to the supermarket, tbh."
28832,Let's party like its the End of the World ..lol..is for them ...
28833,It’s being downvoted because it’s asinine and absolutism.

28835,"I also have no feelings for Texas, but I don’t hope for the worst simply because of their outlook or it’s what they deserve."
28836,Not all 7 hour visits are created equal.

28839,If you’re having a stroke or have had some other kind of trauma that 7 hour wait can be lethal or otherwise irreparably damaging
28840,One year.

28845,Luckily all his favorite places like strip clubs have been closed for months
28846,"While true, this doesn't tell the whole story behind the statistics."
28847,Suppose due partially to quarantine tensions a husband and wife get into a very heated argument and the husband loses his temper and punches a wall.
28848,The wife doesn't feel safe and calls 911.
28849,"This is probably not enough for a charge unless it was accompanied by a threat, but they'll probably tell him he can leave the house to cool down or be arrested and advise her she can get a protection order if she wants."
28850,That will be recorded as a DV callout in statistical reports but may or may not be a pathological abusive relationship in the way you're identifying.
28851,Might be a good reason to get couples  counseling or anger management though.
28852,We are in a war with this virus.
28853,We should be nationalizing the companies who can produce PPE.
28854,Those trying to profit off this war should be tried for murder.
28855,It's about lowering probability of getting it and not completely avoiding the risk which is still there no matter what you do.
28856,"Early IGG studies in the UK suggested at least 3.4 million cases when their lab confirmed case total was closer to 300,000.

Testing is more widespread now, but the US also ignored the lockdowns this summer with young people who are more likely to be asymptomatic or barely symptomatic and necessitate testing, so it would make sense if we blew past 50 million cases months ago."
28857,H1N1 spread to 60 million Americans in less than a year and it is less contagious as an airborne pathogen then the seasonal flu.
28858,"This isn’t measles, where you have a 90% chance at catching it if you are in the same area as a contagious person within two hours of them leaving, but it might be close."
28859,"It is airborne though, meaning cloth masks just reduce viral load and cannot prevent it outright, only N95 masks work for sustainable protection in close contact and we don’t have any."
28860,Are people ejaculating into chicken eggs some how?
28861,"No, that's not how this works."
28862,Just an axample.
28863,"You board your flight, the moron ahead of you is contagious but asymptomatic."
28864,"Because of the way air recirculates on a plane, likely everyone has it now."

28874,"It is ""harmful"" to block students who don't comply with mandatory rules after being given many chances but it's ""not harmful"" for those students to disregard those rules."

28990,"In multiple parts of the world, since the post you were responding to referenced SE Asia and I'm in Canada."
28991,Not all tests here involve a throat swab--a whole school local to me was tested using a gargling method--but many do.
28992,"&gt; Yet, the individuals in question see themselves more as potential millionaires than they do potential paupers

29025,Why did it more than a year for the west to disclose they had the virus since last September?
29026,Why did NATO hold a closed door meeting about the virus last November and told no-one?
29027,"If the west told China last September, it wouldn't have spread there."
29028,But I guess that's the point isn't it?
29029,"The west isn't only at fault for this virus and it's spread, it's at fault for trying to frame it on China."
29030,"Unfortunately for you, China does not believe in forgiveness."
29031,"Ok, Eritrea also has 0 deaths."

29058,How many of these people do you think will be traveling for Thanksgiving?
29059,How many will catch COVID and unsuspectingly pass it on to someone else during the holiday?
29060,These are questions that a responsible person who cares about the rest of humanity would ask before doing something like this.
29061,It's not like no one is dying from it.
29062,"A thousand people a day may seem like nothing to some, maybe because they think it's all old people who were going to die anyway."

29072,It’s because Americans have had so much for so long they act entitled.
29073,"Yes there is poverty in the US, but only in the US are people with iPhones and iPads considered poor."
29074,Americans today will not make sacrifices for the greater public good like they did several generations back.
29075,My friends and I that play both regular and board games have had a discussion about this over chat since our board game days have been nixed this year.
29076,The US approached this all wrong by being completely reactive.
29077,"Oh crap, it got bad, lock it down."
29078,"Oh wait, economy, let's define essential....crazy enough everything but entertainment became essential."
29079,Some got to work from home but many business leaders don't like that so a good portion was still going into to work.
29080,Congress passes a bill that had a 6 month spending window but definitely only had the concept of this lasting 2-3 months in mind.
29081,"Economy and unemployment go to crap, let's open it all back up."
29082,Second wave hits in portions of the South.
29083,Many other places basically implement a reduced capacity that most businesses outside of bars / restaurants / entertainment aren't hitting 80% of their day.
29084,"We get into Fall, the mid-West and norther states start seeing growth."
29085,They basically ignore it in the Mid West and threaten to kidnap a governor in the north...that seems like something people should definitely be doing.
29086,"Now we're her in November, numbers are exploding everywhere, hospitals are getting full everywhere so the ability to spread patients or bring in doctors / nurses for surges is basically impossible and they are getting burned out."
29087,Now we're going to add in all the Fall / Winter holidays and travel over the next six weeks while all of this is happening and how can we expect any less than a disastrous outcome?
29088,The worst part is the scientists literally preached this the entire time.
29089,We just ignored them and didn't implement a real lockdown in March to where we could have had a Summer far similar to what Europe and others had where things actually were operational to a far greater capacity and now we're ignoring the same shutdown metrics that's going to make this far more nightmarish than it has to be.
29090,"If we implemented something to support the citizens and basically keep them home through the holiday season, we'd have this under far more control as we start to roll out vaccines."
29091,"The lack of any kind of planning, strategy, and execution is an utter failure here."
29092,The lessons learned out of this is enormous and is only growing.

29104,"A person stuck in a coma for the rest of their life ""survived"" 

Just because you make it out doesn't mean there aren't long term consequences."
29105,The modeling is constantly checked against reality and adjusted.
29106,At this point the modeling should be pretty accurate regardless of understanding the virus all that much.
29107,In a lot of cases you can just look at trends over time to determine where the trend is going and not exactly need to understand why.
29108,That's pretty much how the world's stock markets all work and it's kind of how quantum mechanics works.
29109,When you don't understand why you just observe changes and everything and look for patterns.
29110,Speculations are that the first person became infected (incubating) in late October of last year.
29111,Began infecting people in November.
29112,"I mean, statistically, those people aren’t going to die from Covid either, which is the personal risk assessment each has made."
29113,Everyone makes these risk assessments daily.
29114,"I can guarantee there’s several risky things you decide to do because your risk assessment tells you it’s fine, and I bet we can find millions of people who think you’re stupid for coming to a different conclusion than them about your personal risk assessment."
29115,But that doesn’t make you stupid.
29116,Perhaps the only true “stupid” people in this are those who don’t understand that very simple concept and instead conflate it with a million different things in order to tell themselves they are SPECIAL and AMAZING and GREAT!
29117,"No, people who are immunocompromised can't get live vaccines, but none of the Covid vaccine candidates are live."
29118,"However, the vaccines have not been tested on pregnant women or young children, to the best of my knowledge."
29119,[removed]
29120,"imagine if this was how China handled the virus, the ""China LIED"" ""Ban Chinese travel"" crowd would lose their minds."
29121,Almost like it was never actually about how China handled it.
29122,"They except China to know everything about a never-before-seen virus the day before it mutated, but it's perfectly normal for western countries to cover it up from September till March until death blew up everyone at once."
29123,They will be donating to other countries yes
29124,Do we know why natural antibodies (getting sick) go away after 3ish months but a vaccine would last longer?
29125,"r/avoidchineseproducts 
Please."
29126,Stay home and don’t do any holiday shopping this year.
29127,"While France is starting to think of easing restrictions with more than 17,000 cases a day, Korea is closing pubs and nightclubs with just over 300 cases a day."
29128,And people wonder why the west is doing so poorly while Asia is doing much much better.
29129,I'm pretty sure people understand that Sweden did (or rather did not do) other things to cause that too.
29130,"&gt;consistently fed misinformation such as it came from a wet market

Well it was certainly wrong conclusion in hindsight, seeing we now know the virus was already circulating in at least Italy last September

But the question then is why did nobody in the west tell the world about it for so long?"
29131,"Let’s pretend the vaccine just doesn’t exist in this universe and now picture this

Canada is at a stage that USA was at, and it is NOT conducting proper lockdowns."
29132,No one in Canada is “locked-down”.
29133,They can do as they please.
29134,So with USA as an example we can see that Canada could potentially be in for a thriller.
29135,"If this vaccine doesn’t help out, USA will continue to get more cases and so will Canada until all of North America is entirely dangerous."
29136,Didn’t some scientist say that 40-60% of the world population would get it?
29137,Well at least they won’t be coming to Canada.
29138,At this rate I’ll be dead before they let them back in and it’s really a blessing in disguise for our country

29152,Whats the point of masks?
29153,So... have they got any new strategy to avoid locking down again?
29154,It’s not even a rant.

The difference is that they actually followed them rather than starting off with some rather bad luck and bureaucratic infighting, followed by a year of political tantrums in which the initial response never really suppressed the virus and the later response never came."

29182,"Correction, thats 49,999,996 beacause this family aint going anywhere."
29183,I am merely stating what successful strategies have in common and that each component is crucial.
29184,You can’t ask people to wear masks whilst at the same time keep bars open and allow people to congregate in restaurants gyms schools etc.
29185,"Similarly, you can’t ignore developing COVID clusters and not mass test- as that will result in community spread (which is what is happening in Europe now) 

Each one of the measures I listed earlier is important, it is not a this or that approach, the more measures governments select the better they will deal with this pandemic."
29186,"While I see where you are coming from, the amount of resources poured into this is astronomical

Two of the leading vaccines are above 90% effective."
29187,"These vaccines will be fine, they just need to be mass produced."
29188,"And with the whole world working towards that goal, id wager we will be in an even better place this summer than some current predictions"
29189,Surely WA closing not just its borders but splitting itself in to 7 regions with controlled movement is no harder than a European country acting to do the same?
29190,I mean in April I couldn't have legally driven my car out of Perth if I had wanted to...
29191,"I feel the biggest thing is that other countries didn't really try, tbh."

29213,Why protest?
29214,They’re protesting themselves for voting for who they did.
29215,Because they make up 1/5 of the population means we need an even greater compliance level from adults though.
29216,"If enough people aren’t vaccinated, it doesn’t work at all."
29217,There will still be large viral loads and exposure that will cause people to get ill.
29218,This is why we still get measles outbreaks in clusters of people with low vaccine compliance rates.
29219,Remember too that some people have allergies or autoimmune disease that may be why they can’t take a vaccine.
29220,People will still get measles for example if they’re exposed to enough loads (and it’s highly contagious and requires a 90+ vaccination rate among your group.)
29221,And now we are vulnerable with having 1/5 of the population unable to vaccinate.
29222,"So we will have a problem of adults working in schools surrounded by highly unvaccinated populations and it continuing to spread, to mutate, etc."

29236,"According to research, most people stop shedding live virus after about 10 days after symptoms onset."
29237,"They may continue to shed dead virus fragments, and those can cause a swab test to be positive, but they cannot infect others."
29238,"In rare cases, people can shed live virus for longer, one person who was immunocompromised shed live virus for over 70 days, but it is not known whether she was shedding high enough amounts to infect another person."
29239,"yes, it is more and more likely that vaccines will end this pandemic, but if sars-cov-2 virus manages to mutate to a form where antibodies made by vaccines or by surviving covid, dont attach to the virus, we are back at square 1."
29240,"If you noticed, Denmark found a new cluster-5 mutation in their minks, basically accidentaly because they noticed minks getting sick and decided to read the genome of the virus, noticed a major difference, isolated people who came in contact with minks and tested the surrounding population."
29241,This mutation is considered extinct but might not be.
29242,"Nevertheless there are known animal reservoars in outher countries in minks and other animals, jumping between humans and animals, which is bad on so many levels."
29243,"We dont sequence the genome  these viruses enough, so we have no idea how many signifucant mutations there are."
29244,And it only takes one for this show to return back to 2019.
29245,"And since majore scientists said it is probably a human made virus and contains parts of HIV, malaria and sars-cov-1, the possibilities of how dangerous this could be are endless."
29246,"As we know HIV shuts down your immune system and malaria is deadly without treatment, imagine a combination of both, with the current virulence (spread rate) and we could be in deep sh*t. Unlikely, almost impossible, but as Lloyd has said, there is a chance..."
29247,"Canada is the #1 country in the world by secured vaccine to population ratio

Canada has purchased enough vacs for ~10x the population

The next is the US or Australia or some first world country  with 5x,"
29248,You’re being optimistic that we even have enough testing supplies to put up numbers like that.

29308,"&gt;With the Flu or Measles the natural immunity lasts most people a lifetime,

Might wanna edit the 'flu' part....."
29309,I think it depends on a lot of things.
29310,Yes traveling for thanksgiving or Christmas is selfish and there isn't a good justification for it in general.
29311,But my sister did just visit us because her daughter was in a childrens mental health facility gor suicidal ideation and my sister couldn't even go in to see her.
29312,So she came to be with family.
29313,Before coming to us she hadn't been showering or getting out of bed.
29314,She needed support.
29315,Travel is still necessary unfortunately for a lot of people.
29316,Going to see loved ones can be important.

29326,"There is not ""good evidence"" for that degree of an undercount."
29327,Meanwhile in California they are trying to act like testing is unreliable because people are using it to work and gather.
29328,It’s such backward messaging.
29329,"At some point all the rich people are going to be vaccinated and all us peons are going to have to go back to work to staff their hotels, and we’re going to need to rely on testing while we do it."
29330,For sure.
29331,"Social skills, I think, are particularly undervalued."
29332,Too many people working with the public just shouldn't be.
29333,"Sometimes it's because they're awkward and shy, sometimes bitter and rude, and sometimes because even though they're technically polite and competent they're also so standoffish and rigid they manage to make the whole experience awful anyway."
29334,I don't know why employers aren't more attuned to how important it is to have someone up front who can put people at ease.

29341,Who did he tell you that to?
29342,I’m so sorry for what you’re going through.
29343,Thank you for sharing your valuable perspective.

29350,"I agree that companionship is important for older folks, but these two have each other, and were not even planning to travel for turkey day.., they just wanted to get away."
29351,Ugh.
29352,They both work too.
29353,Goes both ways tho.
29354,If proper measures were taken and the virus was controlled then such strict lock downs wouldn't be necessary
29355,We had to get groceries a couple of times so that’s part of it.
29356,It was well over a week ago so maybe not needed but just being cautious.
29357,"Paraphrasing here, but Dr Fauci just said on tv that if only 40-50% of the population get the vaccine, we won’t hit herd immunity and the pandemic won’t end."

29378,"I agree, but let’s not discount social pressures."
29379,"If everyone else around you isn’t wearing masks, you’re going to feel pressured to not wear a mask as well, if even just subconsciously."
29380,It’s a difficult hurdle to get over.
29381,You have to reach a critical mass of people to get the societal pressure pushing the other way.
29382,"So interestingly enough my mom who is the director of public health around here told me that of the 700 health care workers in the mayo health system  that have gotten covid, 90 percent got it from outside their place of work not from the hospitals they work at."

29384,Do have a genuine bone in your body?
29385,Or are you only capable of spewing disingenuous fallacies?
29386,"Nothing I posted had anything to do with the acceptable level of death, so no, that's not what this comes down to."
29387,So another straw man.
29388,"But even if we give you credit and I did mention something related to acceptable deaths, this is an oversimplification, or in terms of logical fallacies, a hasty generalization."
29389,And then you throw out a question that diverts us from the subject at hand: Do mask mandates give citizens a choice?
29390,"So no, I won't follow your red herring fallacy and let you distract from the topic."
29391,"I bet your dipshit socrates routine gets a lot of high fives among people who have never debated in their life, but you gotta do better than this if you gonna take a shot at me."
29392,"Money is a part of it, but 1st to finish is probably the goal."
29393,It depends on how many hours the person is working.
29394,If they are jobless they get 60%.
29395,"If they are on Kurzarbeit (still employed, but not working) they get 60% if they work 0 hours unless their employer bumps them up."
29396,If they work 24 hours a week they get 85% pay.
29397,Theres a bit of a formula to it.
29398,If people are working they get nothing extra.
29399,It really depends on what is in the data.
29400,Which we currently don't know.
29401,"We suspect that it will be approved, but you can't approve it until you've assessed all of the data."
29402,It would be really bad if there was an issue found and people weren't told about it and it was just rushed out to people.
29403,"Yeah but most Thanksgiving dinners don't feature hundreds of guests and most family members in most families are not engaging in daily campaigning activities for an election/supreme court nomination...

What likely happened is that Hope Hicks (or someone) got sick between the test and the event, which is an extremely unlikely event in a small gathering in a family that doesn't have to socialize 24/7 with mask-resisting conservatives."

29418,The fact that the “more people die in car accidents” argument holds weight just shows people are grasping at straws to justify their irresponsible behavior.

Additionally, seat belts help prevent death from car accidents, are you not wearing those because “the government is trying to control you?”"

29440,Expect 300k cases/day and 3000deaths/day in mid January
29441,We need a legit lockdown.
29442,"I don't think the vaccine will affect case #s and death rate for another two months or so (people get first dose in mid-December, second dose in mid-January) 

I think the curve is also - hopefully - going to be flattened by the number of states re-imposing restrictions."
29443,"Sadly, not what's happening here in Texas, where in El Paso they're calling in the National Guard to help with morgue duties, but meanwhile our AG is suing the city for trying to impose mild restrictions and shutdowns."
29444,I think that area in my brain must be broken.
29445,I always like to err on the cautious side.
29446,"Plus, with people getting sick all around me at work and still not covering their pie holes when they cough, it's hard not to be pessimistic."

29454,"The [tl;dr list](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html) is that these conditions ARE an increased risk:

&gt;Cancer  
&gt;  
&gt;Chronic kidney disease  
&gt;  
&gt;COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)  
&gt;  
&gt;Heart conditions, such as heart failure, coronary artery disease, or cardiomyopathies  
&gt;  
&gt;Immunocompromised state (weakened immune system) from solid organ transplant  
&gt;  
&gt;Obesity (body mass index \[BMI\] of 30 kg/m2 or higher but &lt; 40 kg/m2)  
&gt;  
&gt;Severe Obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2)  
&gt;  
&gt;Pregnancy  
&gt;  
&gt;Sickle cell disease  
&gt;  
&gt;Smoking  
&gt;  
&gt;Type 2 diabetes mellitus

And these conditions MIGHT be an increased risk:

&gt;Asthma (moderate-to-severe)  
&gt;  
&gt;Cerebrovascular disease (affects blood vessels and blood supply to the brain)  
&gt;  
&gt;Cystic fibrosis  
&gt;  
&gt;Hypertension or high blood pressure  
&gt;  
&gt;Immunocompromised state (weakened immune system) from blood or bone marrow transplant, immune deficiencies, HIV, use of corticosteroids, or use of other immune weakening medicines  
&gt;  
&gt;Neurologic conditions, such as dementia  
&gt;  
&gt;Liver disease  
&gt;  
&gt;Overweight (BMI &gt; 25 kg/m2, but &lt; 30 kg/m2)  
&gt;  
&gt;Pulmonary fibrosis (having damaged or scarred lung tissues)  
&gt;  
&gt;Thalassemia (a type of blood disorder)  
&gt;  
&gt;Type 1 diabetes mellitus

And if you really want to go into the details, the reports and studies that fed into those lists can be found [here](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/evidence-table.html)."

29466,"The irony is how many so called 'patriotic' people I see praising veterans, the military, worshipping the flag, etc and those same people will rail against lockdowns, masks and restrictions."
29467,They talk so highly about sacrifice and then can't do the bare fucking minimum to protect their fellow countrymen.

29474,That's what they're referring to.
29475,I know a lot of people feel different but that's the true number.
29476,For example we know that drug overdose deaths have gone up this year.
29477,So let's say we get everyone vaccinated next year and then drug overdose deaths go back to the 5 year average.
29478,That increase during 2020 is attributed to covid19.
29479,This was from October (your article).
29480,This is what’s happening now.

29491,go back a year and no one would care about this.

29498,Shit happens.
29499,Do we feel sorry for local movie theaters and (not chains) going out of business AND BAIL THEM OUT because home theater setups are so cheap now + streaming services?
29500,Do we feel bad for the guy who owned a franchised blockbuster or video store?
29501,Should we retroactively bail him out?
29502,"The problem is, the moment he goes and works for Biden, half of the country will start believing him even less."

29516,I used to think it was an over estimate.

29518,What did you expect?
29519,Hilary Clinton is still very much a problem for many Americans.
29520,Imagine a bunch of missing emails being a bigger deal than a quarter million dead?
29521,"For North Dakota, 1 of every 1000 has died."
29522,Or kill more by zombifying the public
29523,More It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia.
29524,I dunno if Puerto Rico is the same deal as Oregon... but Oregon until recently was only counting the first test someone took for positivity and ignores subsequent tests.
29525,I think it's done for more randomized sampling (I think) in epidemiology.
29526,I think it's better for growth/spread models but has some problems if the pandemic drags on.
29527,"It skews the positivity rates high though because those subsequent negative tests are ""dropped""."
29528,I think they are dropped with the original intent being that subsequent tests after the first test are not as random as picking a truly random sample.. but don't quote me on that.
29529,Now (IMHO) the idea behind ignoring tests after the first test is to track the spread of a disease outbreak in a small city or a processing plant.
29530,It's not as useful for a LONG pandemic disease outbreak.. but at what point does the processing change from one to the other... which is why Oregon is/or will soon change the reporting to include those negative tests too.
29531,People argued against doing this change a long time ago but comparing state to state no longer makes sense since so many other states have changed this.
29532,I think I recall Florida being the first to include negative tests back into the pile.
29533,A certain amount of this is surmised because I can't find text on it that doesn't involve a 12 hr read of dense epi papers.
29534,Is that why you've the highest incarceration rate on the planet?

1."
29547,"It wasn't actually Manhattan/NYC becoming unaffordable for tons of people and forcing an exodus of lower-income New Yorkers coupled with both *Roe v. Wade* having cratered the number of unplanned, unwanted lower-income people born and the fact that vehicles no longer gave off lead fumes that urbanites grew up and spent their lives inhaling due to gas becoming unleaded in the late 20th century that ""cleaned up"" NYC in the 1990s-2010s instead of the NYPD's punishing (lower-income) people for having broken windows and that
2."
29548,The police generally give a single shit about proper mask-wearing themselves.
29549,"One political party has consistently said that the scientists, nurses, doctors, virologists, etc, are all wrong."

29553,"The tornado itself hits when there are too many cases for the hospitals to handle, resulting in them having to turn away patients or leave them to die without adequate care, while people with other illnesses also start dying at much higher rates because there aren't enough beds/ventilators/staff to treat them."

29865,"I’m not saying this SHOULD be the case, but our current reality is that the average American absolutely does not have many options to shelter."

29867,"You said if what I said was true, then we would already have paid sick leave, and then that we would have paid sick leave because that’s what should feel safe."
29868,The upper middle class clearly has had no problem with the flu and cold season up until this point as demonstrated by their behavior up until 2020.

29935,We have never done significant measures to stop the spread of the flu which is also killing people on a yearly basis.
29936,You never gave a fuck.
29937,I am certain that pre-covid you never shed a tear for someone dying from the flu.

If we can all stay home, so can everyone else"
29998,minimize exposure and change clothes when you get home.
29999,it's the best you can do.

30005,In all likelihood yes.
30006,In theory there could be some reason why they would not recommend this but generally that would not be a serious concern.
30007,What?
30008,You mean the government can pass laws that infringe on freedom in order to protect public safety?
30009,The point still stands.
30010,Okay so explain to me how it’s misleading.

30017,You sound neat.
30018,Kids are virtual and I never leave house.
30019,Mask wearing is really good here in Austin.
30020,"Had to go see a friend in hospice, also strong mask protocols."
30021,Only place I was around people with masks off was airport and plane and incubation periods align.
30022,Not a scientific assessment but a fairly probable source
30023,We just don’t have the levers to force it unless we lay people to take it.
30024,Feds can force the military and federal workers to take it....states can do a similar route.
30025,We could require it for air travel around the same time frame.
30026,But we at least have 70 million morons who won’t be taking the vaccine.
30027,"If we exclude another 70 million kids - half the country will continually infect each other, along with the 5-10 percent where the vaccine doesn’t work."

30037,But that certainly wasn't the case - or priced in - when most people decided to invest in these establishments.

30039,"My MiL is taking all reasonable precautions but is also required to go into work, where not everyone wears a mask (although she always does)."

30071,Pathetic.
30072,"I understand 9/11 was a terrorist attack but the men, women, and children who died were Americans none the less and if you truly gave a shit about 9/11 deaths, you'd give a shit about this too."

30076,"Reading the article it seems like he fell and his injuries were really minor, not traumatic enough to cause death."
30077,He died because his lungs were fucked from COVID.

30180,This is what happens when you believe grifters and con artists over scientists.
30181,That’s not what Fauci and the experts are saying.
30182,Also just the initial round of vaccinations for healthcare workers and at risk populations will bring the death rate down significantly.
30183,Life’s going back to normal soon (it already somewhat is as no restrictions are looking to be placed anytime soon).
30184,Yep.
30185,I thought I had surrounded myself with decent people who cared about others.
30186,"All my friends are in favor of women's rights, mental health care, LGBT, BLM, etc but when it came to staying home, keeping distance, masking up...nope, suddenly they only care about themselves."
30187,Health and safety of others be damned.
30188,It was just an analogy on why older people should get it before younger ppl.
30189,"Jimmy Carter was the last technocrat, but maybe you could argue for Obama too."
30190,This initial wave of the vaccine will be entirely consumed by government and at-risk medical people.
30191,I don't think it is enough to fully cover the medical people.
30192,At risk and older people will get the next wave.
30193,Wonder where the military will be slotted in.

the median COVID-19 infection fatality rate was 0.27% (corrected 0.23%): the rate was

30206,The drivers of the US economy are industrial.
30207,"Silicon Valley, Aerospace, pharmaceuticals, biotech,  energy, etc."

30218,Save the jokes for another time.
30219,"We have a yearly vaccine for the flu, it’s much less deadly, it doesn’t spread at an exponential rate as for Covid-19."
30220,Covid-19 has killed more people in less than a year than the flu kills in many years.
30221,"We get it, you don’t care and you are now spreading misinformation and lies."
30222,Stupid people tend to have kids much younger so even 21+21+21 = 63.
30223,Or 25+25+25 = 75 is plausible.
30224,&gt;It has also been suggested that the 10 pm curfew currently in place could be amended to 11 pm to allow customers to finish their meals and drinks at pubs and restaurants.
30225,They could also just be allowed to take their meals and drinks to go.
30226,Shut down in restaurant dining after 6pm.
30227,So then why are you complaining about wanting private insurance?
30228,You should be asking for more investment in healthcare services.
30229,Private insurance would just mean more doctors focused on less people.
30230,Looks like Trump was right

30332,Rapid tests don't really catch those who've been infected in the past 3 to 4 days but it's better than nothing.
30333,Most importantly when you're just chatting before dinner make sure everyone is masked up because you're not going to be talking 6 feet apart.
30334,"Oh, anyone over 70 shouldn't go at all."

30392,Why should somebody who hasn’t set foot on campus all semester long be forced to the campus to take a COVID test to make the university’s numbers appear better than they actually are?
30393,They should focus testing on those who actually use the campus and leave the folks alone who are self isolating at home.

30504,Yes.
30505,"Plenty of people want to do the right thing, but also plenty of idiots equate mask wearing with tyranny."
30506,It’s a lot greater than 10% in some parts of the country.
30507,These followers equate mask mandates as government oppression.
30508,This is one of Donald Trumps greatest mistakes (and crimes against the people).

30528,"I made sure I had everything I needed two weeks in advance, sat at home for two weeks, took a Covid test three days before the flight and tested negative."
30529,I would be fine with airlines requiring a negative covid test before flying.
30530,"I know people can still catch it between the actual test and the flight, but it would still help to prevent people from flying."

31054,"The IgM results are simply unbelievable with over 10% of the population positive, that indicates a fantastically poor antibody test."
31055,The IgG tests are around 1-2% which are consistent with antibody cross reactivity and false positives (same problem as the initial rounds of antibody testing early in the pandemic).
31056,They do not test against pre-pandemic samples from e.g.
31057,2017 to show that they can detect 0%.
31058,What remains is the 6 samples that tested positive for neutralization on the CPE microneutralization assay.
31059,"With only 6% of the antibody positive samples positive for neutralization this is simply screaming out that their antibody test was total bullshit, yet they don't report it as such and waste a lot of effort talking about the temporal and geographic distribution of all their clearly bullshit IgM results."
31060,"And after the rest of the study I just don't believe them about the 6 positives for neutralization, and I'd like to see another hundred samples from 2017 run through that with no positives, and the results validated by some other lab."
31061,"And wastewater is sensitive to around 3 known infections per 100,000 or roughly 30 per 100,000 or 0.03% population infected."
31062,It is highly sensitive.

31200,"Also, my job demands that I be here."
31201,This happened twice already.
31202,It was when the Wuhan strain mutated in Europe and the mutated strain in minks.
31203,Possibly another mutated strain in India/Bangladesh.
31204,Wouldnt be surprised if the wuhan strain was not the first.
31205,"For a coronavirus, this one seems to mutate a lot more than were veing led to believe."
31206,Bad year for mink.

31213,"There is so many companies trying to make vaccines,  which one do you trust?"
31214,"Somebody downvoted this, but I think you’re absolutely right and this is quite insightful."
31215,That’s not to say that the left isn’t also at fault for being very conformist.
31216,It’s just in this specific case the conformity has been expressed as following the guidance of the experts rather than supporting their president.
31217,I have a question to resolve an argument with a friend.
31218,"So, my group of friends and myself have been hardcore social isolating and all wearing masks when we do go out."
31219,"For example, my girlfriend and I literally only go to the grocery store, gas station, and my mom's house to do laundry (since the alternative is a laundromat, which is worse--we wear masks around her)."
31220,That's literally it.
31221,I'm not exaggerating.
31222,My friends and I haven't hung out together at all since March.
31223,"Today, I was talking with my one friend about how great it will be when we're all vaccinated and can hang out again (at each other's houses only); however, he said he wasn't comfortable with it even then."
31224,"Since we'd all still be practicing the same precautions outside of hanging out, I said that it would be practically impossible for one of us to get corona and pass it to the others."
31225,"He disagrees with this, but can't explain how it could happen."
31226,"He cited a health official who said life wouldn't ""get back to normal"" until May, but was unable to explain how that was relevant when I pressed the issue."
31227,I should mention that none of us are in a high risk group.
31228,"My questions are: 

1."
31229,Is my friend being overly paranoid or is there evidence that one vaccinated person could pass coronavirus to another vaccinated person in such a way that illness could result?
31230,2.
31231,"Are there any credible health officials or scientists suggesting that it wouldn't be safe for a group of vaccinated friends to meet up in a small home setting, taking into account the other precautions we're taking in our lives?"
31232,"I'd like to be able to say that my friend has a point, but I just don't see how there's any real risk involved."
31233,I'm afraid it's purely mental health related.
31234,"Plenty of people care about stopping it, just not at the specified cost."
31235,"If you're told you can stop the virus by not seeing your family or going out to have fun, or by having to remember to wear an annoying and uncomfortable face mask every single time you step into public, they won't be interested."
31236,"Lower the cost to ""come into a pharmacy twice in 30 days and get an injection,"" and they will be."
31237,More of Governor Abbot's leadership failure.
31238,I get it .. but it’s likely that they also spread it to people who were not playing stupid games.. and possibly the healthcare workers that may have to take care of them.
31239,Nothing about the situation is funny.
31240,A lot of innocent people are dying.. alone.
31241,"""May"" is in the context of the alternative."
31242,Is it anger management and probation or a jail sentence?
31243,"And the example would meet the statutory definition of disorderly conduct or maybe terroristic threatening but not domestic battery, but as always the context is important."
31244,One disorderly conduct case is not the same as another.
31245,If by years you really mean weeks...then yes.

31250,It certainly fits my face well.
31251,"I just wonder if it’s counterfeit or not, that would be shitty"
31252,People just want to blame China not realising that whatever was done in Europe is what led to the mutated strain that made this a pandemic in the first place.
31253,Honestly depending on the major metro area it can be easier.
31254,I’m in NYC and the parks and museums are mostly empty with some pretty strict mask policies and occupancy limits.
31255,I went to the MoMA the other day and it was basically deserted.
31256,There’s plenty to do here that’s fun and safe
31257,I wouldn't say nobody cares.
31258,"There are 2 million redditors here, and we might not all agree on the particulars, but you won't get much argument that we can't yet know what the consequences are long term, even for people who survived the initial infection relatively unscathed."
31259,"That's true of many viruses in the wild, and it's more than just their mortality rate that caused mankind to prioritize finding vaccinations for them."
31260,"But there is a kind of willful ignorance about it, that is understandable in some people."
31261,"If you can't isolate, and stay that way, it's just a self-protection mechanism to minimize the risk."
31262,"And the people announcing their psychological ""hack"" are looking for support to improve it's efficacy."
31263,"It probably helps to remember that most of these people are acting out of discomfort and fear and a feeling of helplessness, that downplaying the seriousness of our situation, helps them cope with."
31264,"Of course, not all of them."
31265,"People with some kind of celebrity status, urging others to behave unsafely, are looking for followers."
31266,"They are looking to exploit that psychological need, to line their own pockets."
31267,I reserve a particular amount of loathing for them.
31268,As far as the rest.
31269,Absolutely.
31270,"The country elected a self-absorbed, ignorant, incompetent, greedy, narcissist president, and he behaved with predictable ineptitude in the face of this challenge."
31271,"They put someone who's not fit to run ANYTHING, in charge of our country, and 300,000 Americans paid the price for that, so far."
31272,"And it's really horrific to see the proof this month, that a solidly high percentage of Americans don't see that as a problem."
31273,"A solidly high percentage of Americans can't look around the world at examples of other countries handling this appropriately, and see how Covid is a lesson for us all."
31274,At this point we're panicking on whether we are learning anything sigh.
31275,Isn't positivity rate just (# of positive results)÷(# of total results)?
31276,"So on a day where say you had 1000 tests done, if 11 turn up positive your positivity rate for that day is 11/1000 = 0.011 = 1.1 %."
31277,1.
31278,"Not important today since the abolishment of the gold standard
2."
31279,"I can easily find someone today in 2020 to sell me something I want for a barrel of oil which is still a barter ( good for good)
3."
31280,If your workers accept hair you can pay them with hair (if not violating the law) it does not matter.
31281,Gold ist not **generaly** accepted as currency on national scale in any nation.
31282,The trade of money on forex markets (just like stocks on the stock exchange) is like trading commodities because money (and shares of a company) are commoditized (undifferentiated).
31283,Gold is traded as a commodity on commodity exchanges which implies that it is generaly accepted as a commodity.
31284,Money is traded LIKE a commodity.

31351,"Not sure what you mean b ""throw caution to the wind"" here?"
31352,The cautious action is to not vaccinate children prematurely.
31353,Remember: vaccinating children soon means subjecting them to the risk of a vaccine not having been through large scale testing in children.
31354,The risk of a vaccine can be higher than the risk of the disease for young children.

31574,I understand why you think assignments might be easier for us.
31575,"And honestly, I agree they result in better learning."
31576,"But, low stakes assignment would have been much better if we were taking only one course."
31577,"Which none of us do, everyone has multiple courses."
31578,"So, we end up with a submission a day on average."
31579,"And assignments require much more effort than watching lecture, and I agree that putting that effort is worth it from a learning perspective, but when being stressed for a whole day is worth just 1-5 grade points out of hundred, we feel a bit cheated."
31580,"People don't skip it, as assignments usually become the driving force of the course for students, and missing out on an assignment is equivalent to a week of backlog in the course, which means you do next assignment with less knowledge, and more pressure of not doing the previous assignment."
31581,"Assignment being the driving force of learning is a sad state of affairs, I completely agree to it, but it is what it is for most of the us."
31582,"I try to stay ahead of the assignment timeline, tried the whole semester, but I just couldn't keep up with so many assignment, and a general lack of enthusiasm due to mundane lifestyle."

31584,"Which are open to suggestions, and not stubborn."

31589,"Students hesitate to speak in class, and that happens more during online sem, so you may use following points tod drive the conversation, and make more and more people participate."
31590,A) Asking general opinion about autumn semester.
31591,"B) Their experience with assignments and workload from all the courses, and maybe additional workload due to online sem (this is more applicable to students from my country, as we usually do help out our parents in household chores)

C) Ask their opinion about low stake assignment vs high stake exams."
31592,"I apologise if I wasn't clear enough while writing, english isn't my primary language, there are significant cultural differences between me and your students, and I do have a student bias in writing this :p.

31618,You can't just read/quote the data that supports your claims and overlook the rest.
31619,Business regulation doesn’t happen in a vacuum.
31620,"Politicians and policy-makers aren’t sitting around, concocting new ways to control people’s lives."
31621,"Generally, an “Orwellian” regulation is the result of corporations behaving badly, usually repeatedly, as paying any fine if caught for said bad behavior is just part of the cost of doing business."
31622,"“I trust people to operate responsibly” is code for “do whatever you want, and remember I pandered to that when in the voting booth.”

As a proud member of the ‘tax-and-spend, Liberty-hating left,” I just shrug and say “Yeah; someone needs to be the adult in the room.”

Who am I to tell you what to do?"
31623,"Well, I’m the voice of the voiceless, the quarter-million dead who don’t have a say in things."
31624,These people died because others didn’t take precautions.
31625,Precautions.
31626,"Not oppression; precautions, a way of mitigating a danger to others."
31627,"Goddammit, why is this such a difficult concept to understand?"
31628,"Why is selfishness a feature of “Liberty?”

Motherfuckers, one of the leading minds in American Liberty, Thomas Paine would have worn a mask."
31629,"He’d have looked at it and said “we have such a simple device to defend and protect so many; arguably the greatest invention since the pen!” 

Franklin, man of science, father of the USPS, would have embraced a mask as a means to further the cause of the early Americans."
31630,"That, and if that was all the protection he needed to be nearer the ladies, he’d cover his mouth and nothing else."

31634,"I believe every modern President all the way to FDR would be leading by example, barring the current trash human being occupying that seat."
31635,But I digress.
31636,Selfish disregard for our fellow man cannot be the hallmark of the Liberty and freedoms we have.
31637,"Exceptions to all our freedoms exist, and walking around without a muffler should be where personal freedoms end, and rudely, even expensively."
31638,"My pursuit of life, liberty and happiness doesn’t end at the tip of your nose, but from and around where you begin to breathe your air."
31639,Changing this colloquially considered standard could revolutionize thought when considering rights and responsibility.

32041,I wish people on reddit would realize that you can both be critical of public health policies disregarding the economic &amp; emotional impact of this year while also abiding by them out of interest of keeping yourself physically healthy.
32042,"I know that is a slippery slope, but I'd just think it would be common sense."
32043,One thing I've learned though is that you can never underestimate human stupidity.
32044,"You see so many stories about ""I didn't think it was a big deal"" and people regretting holding these gatherings in their homes that one would hope things would have sunk in by now."
32045,"But I digress, too many people have given up so I am done trying to help educate others and just hope we get a publicly available vaccine soon so I can go to bars and hang out with people again."

32101,"just fyi, 'exponentially' is an expression often used in everyday life in SK so maybe they do actually have a better idea.Its not a problem trying to defend your own countries failed response to the virus, but as the commenter above mentioned, the inherent racist idea that what happens in the (barbaric) China cant happen in the advanced west kind of mindeset, this I have definitely witnessed in the early days of the pandemic."
32102,"Its not a wonder since the west have indeed been the center of colonization, invasions and wars, and subsequentlt economic and technological advance, but hey history is a dymamic things, so maybe its okay to be a bit open-minded to other explanations."

32159,"Nurses don't show up to the hospital in hazmats and break rooms have been shown to perpetuate the spread, so having covid positive nurses at work is extremely risky."

32236,Strange so many more people seem to upvote the long term immunity articles when there is so much more evidence for short term immunity.
32237,I think some people are mistaking or being overly hopeful in their interpretation of immunity vs resistance.
32238,Detection of antibodies alone doesn't prove sterilizing immunity.
32239,Detection of T cells and other immune cells tells us even less as to what level of immune response you will actually get and thus we can bet on immunity even less from those theories.
32240,In any case immunity really doesn't matter with vaccine coming out and talking about long term immunity WILL MOST DEFINATELY cause less people to get vaccinated.
32241,You can read it and see it happening right in the comments of articles suggesting long term immunity right here on reddit.
32242,As soon as you give people a reason to consider alternative narratives a good chunk of people jump ship to the new narrative if only to be different and unique in their own minds.
32243,In avoiding conformity sometimes we make very stupid decisions.
32244,You see it all the time in people trying to *act cool.
32245,"* 

Like it or not the VAST MAJORITY of data says short term immunity."
32246,I suspect average immunity in the range of 6-12 months based on the majority of data and I'm being hopefully when I say 12 months.
32247,"When you read UP TO 7 MONTHS IMMUNITY, that's not a scientific way to talk about immunity."
32248,Immunity should be an average.
32249,In this case at least they've shorten the time down to a more realistic window of probable immunity.
32250,"**MOST people will be immune for 3 months is a high probability statement and that's how you should think about immunity, as a probability that varies significantly from person to person."
32251,** At least in the case of coronaviruses.
32252,"With the Flu or Measles the natural immunity lasts most people a lifetime, but those are completely different viruses."
32253,"And yeah you do get immune to whatever flu strain you get for life usually, it's just the flu mutates like no other virus and producing new strains constantly."
32254,That's how it sticks around.
32255,"Coronavirus sticks around by not producing long term immunity reliability, otherwise it would eradicate itself."
32256,"COVID could be different, but most data does not suggest that it is."
32257,So I'm glad to see a more honest interpretation of the facts for once.
32258,"They went conservative in their estimate, which is the only responsible way to present immunity data."
32259,You don't want people thinking they are immune when they aren't.
32260,It does bring up the question as to how long will the vaccine immunity really last because I don't expect to eradicate this virus.
32261,My 150+ high school students have 100% mask compliance in class every day.
32262,I have to remind a few about noses...mostly due to loose masks.
32263,"If HS kids, notorious for flaunting rules, can do the right thing, the adults should be doing better."
32264,Risk vs reward.
32265,The reward shown with the Moderna study are that 99.96% of the vaccinated patients didn’t contract COVID and 99.4% of the patients who received the placebo didn’t contract COVID.
32266,That’s about a half of a percentage difference with a margin of error of probably at least 1%.
32267,So is the reward that great with unknown risks?
32268,Fucking hell.
32269,No rule of law.
32270,It sounds like problems that a third world country would experience.
32271,"Not catching it, but dying from it yea"

32326,Why is that?
32327,One thing my dad said that has really stuck with me is that Sweden hasn't had a proper national crisis for over 200 years.
32328,No war since Napoleon.
32329,Most of Europe has had parents or grandparents who could tell them of WW2 etc..  it's like they don't have the collective memory to work out how bad things can really get.
32330,I'm not saying covid is on a scale even remotely close to that...
32331,But rather that they didn't seem to think they should make allowances for extraordinary situations in their constitution (which is from 1972 I think).
32332,"I think there are accommodations for war, so maybe they could convince Norway to pretend to take back bohuslan lol."

32358,In Korea (almost the same population) are increasing restrictions with only 330 cases.
32359,Europe will never get things under control this way.
32360,China has more than triple the population of little USA and they had less total cases than USA gets every single day lol.

32375,"* COVID did spread to other provinces in China, China was able to deal with it because of early detection."
32376,"* Almost every single COVID treatment used to date was discovered in China then slowly tricked into the west, COVID PCRs were invented in China, the genome was first sequenced in China, and the majority of medical equipment used in western hospitals are made in China."
32377,"The west dosn't even compare to China in term of technology
* Oh and Chinese vaccines has been in emergency use since September with a million vaccinated already, hundreds of thousands doses are arrived in Brazil, and Middle Eastern countries are already getting jabs."

32439,We have one kid in private school that has been in session since September.
32440,They just sent out an update since they had been getting so many questions- they have not had a single Covid case.
32441,They wear masks and we are fortunate that they are able to move to outdoor classes for winter and they have many other mitigation strategies.
32442,My other kiddo does not have any in person options available to them.
32443,The difference in learning and demeanor of the two is heartbreaking.
32444,Even with some of the chaos and restrictions of in person my in person kid is thriving while the online is not.

32499,The US is an outlier here and it's going to be extremely damaging for tens of millions of children who rely on public schools.
32500,Public education is one of the great equalizing institutions in society and closing them for over a year is going to have horrific consequences.
32501,This subreddit views public health exclusively to mean how many COVID cases a country has.
32502,Masks probably have a dampening effect in some circumstances but overemphasizing them by saying baseless things like they are effective as a vaccine is delusional and obviously will lead to risk compensation.
32503,The amount of people here who think that the reason COVID is spreading in the US is just because people aren't wearing masks is crazy.
32504,"Belgium ""loosening"" their mask rules was just removing a blanket mandate outside, because having mask mandates when your walking down a street nowhere near anybody is just security theater."
32505,"Nobody knows much about mRNA vaccines at this point, that's the problem."

32519,It was exponential in the first wave and if you just ignore a virus it will spread exponentially by it's very nature.
32520,That's what a virus does.
32521,Unless it kills like 70% of the infected or isn't really contagious.
32522,You make it sound like it's a revelation that it behaves like this after a scientist said so.
32523,Scientists all over the world have been saying exactly that since the very beginning.
32524,"India has an absolutely massive population, I’m not sure comparing raw numbers in that case is particularly informative, better to go per capital."
32525,Ask and you shall receive!
32526,"https://www.ustranscom.mil/cmd/docs/TRANSCOM%20Report%20Final.pdf

Edit: study starts on page 2."
32527,Page 1 is a clarification.
32528,"A recent study came out showing that SARS - which is a different virus, but is probably the closest thing we've got - seems to have left survivors with some level of protection even 17 years down the road."
32529,"Now, ""some level of protection"" doesn't necessarily mean immunity, but it may mean that your body can start bumping out antibodies so quickly that you may barely get any symptoms and will probably be over and done with it (possibly including not being contagious) in only 3-4 days."
32530,It may be an experience so minor that you could essentially mistake it for immunity.
32531,"Now, that's no guarantee, but it's a very similar virus, and it's very encouraging."
32532,One thing we definitely know - reinfection on the scale of less than a year is *exceedingly* rare.
32533,"It's been documented to happen, but last I heard the reinfected number is under 30 and we have 58 million confirmed primary cases, so... roughly 1 in 2 million?"
32534,Maybe more?
32535,Maybe less?
32536,"It's an open question, but the Magic 8 Ball says things are looking good on immunity."
32537,"A co-worker said to me""Nobodies stopping me from seeing my family.."" ohhh ok there"
32538,"IFR is relatively low (around 2%), but infection rate is high."
32539,That makes it deadly.
32540,Well they will be.
32541,"Things will most definitely be normal by Fall ~~2020~~, ~~2021~~, 2022."
32542,Czech Republic and Greece?
32543,What?
32544,You might want to recheck your sources.
32545,How horrible
32546,Indeed :)
32547,With a 95% effective rate it would be extremely unlikely if you are all vaccinated.
32548,They don’t know 100% yet whether people who get the vaccine can still get infected and pass the virus to others but be asymptomatic - in the phase 3 trials they didn’t test everyone continuously so they don’t know for sure if some people still got the virus but were asymptomatic and/or if they could still spread the virus (people in the trials were asked to get tested if they had symptoms).
32549,"But the vaccine is successful in stopping severe cases for sure and quite possibly stops infection all together, they just can’t say for sure."
32550,They will know more as time goes on.
32551,"In saying that, it looks like it won’t be until around April or later for you to get vaccinated unless you are a healthcare worker."
32552,Healthcare workers + elderly are the first group to get vaccinated (hopefully mid to late December after EUA) then they will likely reduce the age group (eg over 60’s) for the next lot of vaccinations.
32553,They will continuously review the results and then apply to get the vaccine licenced and that’s when it becomes available for the general population.
32554,"They are hoping to do this in Q2 or maybe Q3 of 2021 (source: Scott Gottlieb, board member of Pfizer and former FDA Commissioner)."
32555,Full immunity kicks in around 2 weeks after your second jab so about 4-6 weeks after your initial jab.
32556,&gt;Solution is socialize education and health care.
32557,Education is already socialized for K-12 and may states such as my own is heavily funding Pre-K programs.
32558,Healthcare could be socialized more but there has to be serious cost reductions in the system first.
32559,I don't think universities should be socialized as they really aren't public goods.
32560,They are very exclusionary - with the median American let alone the poor often lacking the requisite skills/certifications to be accepted and succeed in many of them.
32561,This is in contrast to K-12 which is accessible nearly by right and they cannot turn away anyone even if they have severe mental disabilities.
32562,&gt; Do away with the war machine and scrutinize government spending.
32563,"Restoring the military budget to pre-Trump levels would only free up around $70B of the budget, which would certainly help but isn't really enough to pay for many proposed social programs here."
32564,"Also, keep in mind that our deficit on a normal year is around $1T...

&gt; It works for many countries and can definitely work for us."
32565,"These systems ""work"" for other countries but that doesn't necessarily make it the most desirable."
32566,"In terms of healthcare, there isn't any real argument that other nations outperform us big time in this regard."
32567,The one strong point of American healthcare is drug/treatment development and specialist availability but that's really it.
32568,"In terms of education, it may ""work"" for other countries but I don't think Americans really understand the consequences of how universities in other countries are set up for their universities to be cheap."
32569,"American tertiary education even with its big secondary school achievement gap is still among the most inclusive and universal of the world, with around 56% of US adults having attempted college education at some time."
32570,"In other nations, especially European nations, only around 10-30% of adults at any given time have the *right* to study at a university at any given time and earning that right often requires secondary students to be put into schools that they have to be tested in middle schools to gain entrance to."
32571,"European taxation is also a lot more regressive than the US which means that marginalized immigrants, the poor, the blue collar labor force, people with no real shot at goint to university etc... are paying some pretty hefty taxes for mostly upper middle class students in Europe to study without paying a cent."
32572,"&gt; Obviously insurance companies who fill political wallet, has a big say

Post ACA the average profit margin of an healthcare insurance company is only around 4%."
32573,Plenty of insurers left the market because they couldn't afford the cost of having to accept sicklier uninsured people.
32574,I don’t think anyone will gather inside really besides the bathroom.
32575,I agree though
32576,Lmao
32577,I’m lucky enough to live within a drivable distance so I’ll be road tripping home but I feel bad for my friends who live across the country being vilified just because they have to get home.
32578,My school is closing all residence halls so there is literally no other choice
32579,Hahaha!
32580,Of course you're a denier.
32581,"Yeah, if the only thing keeping someone from being abusive was the fact that they were distracted by their job or whatever they were doing before lockdown, it was probably only a matter of time before they started doing it anyway."
32582,"A lot of the problems people argue are being caused by lockdowns are really old problems that were being swept under the rug before, and they'll probably come out again whenever society is disrupted enough."
32583,the poop must flow
32584,It’s a distraction to think it was educational issue.
32585,It was intentional propaganda to repeat misleading ideas over and over to resist public health authorities.
32586,It became an issue of “faith”.
32587,"US has been doing something--Individual states like California just put out a month long curfew, many states have acted in reaction to their rising numbers---and today ten European countries once again reported higher death tolls per capita than the US"
32588,"Trump may not have a great personality, but his policies aren’t bad."
32589,Saying mean things doesn’t mean you are bad with policies.

32596,"Sure, every virus will have some rate of mutation but it's much slower than something like the flu."
32597,There's been little evidence that any of the common mutations circulating will have any effect on immunity.
32598,Also consider that these vaccines use the spike protein to train the immune system.
32599,A point mutation elsewhere in the viral genome is irrelevant.

32921,Actively mocking people for mask wearing should be met with reckless endangerment when your responsibility is to the safety of your citizens.
32922,"&gt;Aside from health care workers and frontline workers, I don’t think many people are getting covid that are genuinely doing what they reasonably can to avoid it."

32934,I agree with most points.
32935,But it's still not very comparable when you being to take into account the population.
32936,"Australia is 75% the size of the US (in terms of landmass), however it has less than 1/10th the population."
32937,This alone means people are more likely to be spread out from each other.

32953,"&gt;  
&gt;So no, it wasn't a mistake for the WHO to point out there were far more infections in Sweden than had previously been reported."
32954,"You do realize that if you start test the public, you will find many more cases?"

33154,"There is moderate certainty evidence that wearing a mask probably makes little or no difference to the outcome of laboratory‐confirmed influenza compared to not wearing a mask (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.26; 6 trials; 3005 participants)

That's pretty clear in stating the evidence points to masks being ineffective."
33155,"You can say that better quality research needs to be done, but systematic reviews/meta analyses of RCTs are the best standard of evidence we currently have - meaning they supersede the poorly controlled observational studies that people usually cite to claim masks work."
33156,There is of course plenty of pre-COVID research of similar calibre that finds masks to be useless in preventing respiratory illness.

34430,They closed 5% of the gyms.
34431,That's like clinching your cheeks 5% and say you're holding the poop in.
34432,"Using that as a reference to ""sweden is closing down"" can and should be seen as spreading disinformation."
34433,"You know exactly what I'm talking about, don't act dumb."
34434,well that's what they tell you..lol...even my Chinese associates there say don't trust the government.
34435,but they are much more proactive.
34436,"If there are a few cases, they lock it all down and do mass testing."
34437,people complain about tyranny and losing freedoms here...go to China and see what they have to do and makes you think twice about how spoiled we are here.
34438,You should delete this comment.
34439,You dont go to ASU and know the kind of shit they pull.
34440,I go in regularly to get tested and was summoned to take a random test basically the day after getting a test.
34441,They lock people out of their accounts who never go to campus for not filling out a health check that can only be accessed on an app that barely works.
34442,No refunds for 800 dollar parking passes that suddenly became useless or classes that are 2x less effective.
34443,Can people also stop posting ad wall articles?

34445,The US had incredibly generous unemployment benefits for those who lost their jobs during the lockdown.
34446,"If ""all you got"" was $1200 that means you didn't actually lose your job."

34478,"Hopefully though if healthcare workers and vulnerable elderly get the initial vaccine the death rate should reduce, but again, they won’t have full immunity until after all the family holidays."

34489,"Those idiots could be millionaires for all I care, but their still idiots for complaining."

34526,This is a sensible solution and has extremely low likelihood of transmission.
34527,This is the type of thing we should have advocated for instead of the Zoomgiving.
34528,"Right now, the dilemma appears to be Zoomgiving (LOL at the elderly figuring out Zoom) or having a traditional, indoor extended family Thanksgiving."

34535,"It was a very, very unpleasant surprise."

34564,"It's thinking that because the winning number was X last time, it has more chance of being **not-X** next time."
34565,The distinction is significant.
34566,Assuming that because the number was X last time it has more chance of being X again is **not** necessarily a fallacy.
34567,"For example, imagine that the number 19 came up 30 games in a row."
34568,"There are two possible hypotheses that make sense:

1."
34569,"The machine is fair, and the number 19 just happened to be picked a bunch of times in a row

2."
34570,"The machine is biased toward the number 19  - maybe the ball weighs more or something - in which case 19 really is more likely to be picked on turn 31

Gamblers fallacy would be a third hypothesis:

3."
34571,"19 has come up 30 times in a row, there's no way it can come up again."
34572,"(Or alternatively - 17 hasn't been picked in 30 games, it has to pick 17 soon)."

34749,"Which, if 250k isn’t a lot to you, I’d hate to see what is."
34750,Have a holly jolly Christmas!
34751,It’s the best time of the year!
34752,I don’t know if there’ll be snow!
34753,But hopefully it’s cold enough the bodies don’t rot when the morgues overflow!
34754,Wait so the German CDC is named after the word you use for acknowledging a sneeze?!
34755,That's badass.
34756,"It's stupid, but people are paranoid that the government's ""newfound power"" to tell people what to do will end up in a dictatorship."
34757,People need to understand that moderation is a thing.
34758,"Keep in mind those are CONFIRMED cases, not everybody gets confirmed."
34759,I had tickets booked to go home.
34760,Cancelled them last week.. 75 and Sunny here where I am all week this upcoming week and I've got it off.
34761,Bought a 15 dollar turkey.. could be worse!
34762,Yes!
34763,"It's mind boggling to give this advice, even though most people already have travel plans and will clearly travel regardless."
34764,"The test is not foolproof, so probably skip Thanksgiving with 80 yr old grandma regardless, but there's many other cases where your risk tolerance will be a bit higher, and harm reduction will go a long way."
34765,"Highly recommend following Michael Mina, Harvard epi making a big push for universal rapid testing:

34766,"Nope, still full of shit."
34767,I don’t trust him.
34768,That law on assembly is shit.
34769,But we’re digressing.
34770,Coming back to the topic at hand - are these reason enough for you to dismiss the way we got Covid under control?
34771,Because that’s just absurd.
34772,[deleted]
34773,"Most ritzy schools like Duke, Princeton, etc use large parts of their endowments to make sure that money isn't an issue for those that can get in, and they usually do need blind admissions."
34774,I went to Duke grad school for free and I have a friend that went to Princeton undergrad  for free.
34775,"Why is need in quotes ""need""."
34776,As if you doubt that Americans truly need to work.
34777,We have no safety net.
34778,"Even unemployment pay may take months to get, if you get it at all."
34779,"We ""need"" to live indoors and eat."
34780,"We are not given ""options""."
34781,You’re not going to catch the people who are actively spreading via tests that take 2-3 days to process considering spread peaks a day before symptoms start and lasts for just a few days.
34782,"If you got tested on day 1 or 2 of your infection, you’re almost certain to test negative, then you show up to Thanksgiving, spread it, then show symptoms the day after."
34783,It’s really hard to harm reduction COVID via testing unless you’re ignoring symptoms
34784,What are you rambling about?
34785,Just gave birth 7 weeks ago!
34786,We had lots of scares through work but thankfully never caught it.
34787,You guys can do it!
34788,Never let anyone pressure you into any gatherings.

34793,Conspiracy theorists of the German kind.
34794,Absolute idiots
34795,"You just picked a state at random for this headline,  didn't you?"
34796,I think it is fucking hilarious.
34797,Leftists getting PTSD from the moralizing fearporn they so love to propagate.
34798,"Once more leftists are their own worst enemies, sadly this time it did not end with them in a mass grave like the other times"
34799,Unfortunately attacking morons not wearing a mask is still illegal.
34800,Who are these people that you’re touting want another lockdown with no government support.
34801,Literally all conversations I’ve seen about another lockdown go hand in hand with we need government payout and support
34802,Wasn't the original comment quoting Trump out of satire?
34803,"His twitter would be THE source of the quote for that, I'd think."
34804,Yup.
34805,"I got into tower climbing, wanted to get out so I took a year off to get my EMT and IV cert."
34806,"As I found out what it paid (and I’m in a very high rental area) I just went straight back into tower climbing, no degree, working the way up to 5-6x the pay of an experienced EMT."
34807,It’s sad really.
34808,"They could get spit on, shot, kicked, lit on fire, BIT, kicked, be exposed to traumatic events, and that’s how the pay works."
34809,(Or doesn’t work I should say)
34810,They're being sarcastic.
34811,Companies and governments have taken to framing global issues that are largely being influenced by them as being a problem of personal responsibility that the individuals are responsible for.
34812,"Instead of addressing things like coal power, industrial carbon output, inefficient shipping practices, etc they instead say that you need to buy a hybrid to stop global warning because your minuscule carbon footprint is what's *really* causing climate change."
34813,"In the same way, with COVID-19 they're framing people getting the virus as them being irresponsible, instead of doing things like mask mandates, surge testing, limited capacity enforcement, lockdowns, forcing all jobs that can be done remotely to WFH, etc."
34814,"While individuals *can* make decisions to reduce their risk of getting the virus, even people who are doing everything right are getting the virus because overall infections are high as a result of government not doing a good job setting the rules and leading the people in strong pro-social behavior."
34815,The poor souls who are raging as they die that it's all a hoax are the ones that trouble me.
34816,The species has issues if we are capable of that sort of self delusion...

34837,Mine is going virtual after this week.
34838,Many of my students have informed me of missing a day or two of class for travel.
34839,"One student is going to fly multiple times to see BOTH SIDES of the family, one being in an ultra hot spot, over the holiday."
34840,Very glad I won’t be seeing her in person again.
34841,"Two of my students have already had Covid, though fortunately exposed during a break in which I didn’t see them."
34842,I don’t get paid enough for this.
34843,A school schools.
34844,That passive immunity is temporary.
34845,"Eventually, even this winter, they could both be infected again."
34846,When the virus wipes us out at least China will be around to be more competent than us
34847,He wore a mask until he had it and is now immune.
34848,Genuine question: Is there a reason you are using an article from April as evidence regarding numbers being reported today?
34849,"Also, the article gives a very clear rationale to the numbers being updated, stated that ""While these so-called excess deaths were not explicitly linked to the virus, they might not have happened had the outbreak not occurred, in part because it overwhelmed the normal health care system.""."
34850,"This is comparing the number of deaths from one year to another, showing a strange anomaly of 3,700 excess deaths (not directly linked to covid) occured in the same time period when compared to prior years."
34851,"Also, these additional 3,700 deaths were only added after an assessment of the time between the 11th of March and the 13th of April."
34852,The numbers being reported TODAY do not that this additional length of time assessment.
34853,"Don't take this the wrong way, but there are numerous holes in your logic and a lot of conclusions being leapt to."
34854,Do you happen to have anything more up to date and more suspicious than a rationally though out and explained article from April?
34855,"Comparing the UK to America is not exactly fair though, seeing as only about 4-5 states have a population density more than the UK’s overall population density, and many states have a far lower density"
34856,[removed]
34857,depends on the state really.
34858,"some teachers have shit pay, in other states they make twice as much as the average American."
34859,it's still an above average job in general
34860,no they will not ..
34861,"I worded it facetiously, but: https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.jsonline.com/amp/5187856002"
34862,"This is what I dislike about government agencies dumbing down guidelines to be comprehensible by layman, because it sounds contradictory if you don't know the source of truth."
34863,People think oh I'm 6 feet away I'm fine.
34864,"No, it's at least 6 feet because it's impractical for stores to accommodate even larger gaps."
34865,Yes.
34866,"Because that works, this is just senseless."
34867,This is pure bullshit.
34868,I am from Norway.
34869,"I still go to bars, I have barely used a mask ever."
34870,"Compared to the rest of the world, my life now is pretty normal."
34871,And we have had 1 deaths in my home city area among 250k people.which happened in the start of April.
34872,And it is true that during the summer our restrictions was prerty much non-existent.
34873,Here is the difference with Sweden though.
34874,We have set up restrictions whenever the amount of people testing positive goes up.
34875,"And in the start, before people had any idea what was going on, and how to protect the ones who need it, we did a total lockdown."
34876,"During the summer, when the numbers of infected was in the 1 in a million per day, we relaxed the regulation a lot."
34877,"Now, when the numbers have been going up again, strickter regulations has been set up all over the country, and specifically in areas with higher numbers."
34878,And we are already killing the second wave.
34879,This is not at all comparable to the Swedish approach.
34880,My coworker did that to separate two pieces of paper that he was handing to me.
34881,That he could have emailed to me.
34882,"And remarked ""These damn masks make is hard to lick your fingers""

Let's just shoot the earth into the sun at this point."
34883,Almost certainly.
34884,Pfizer gave the FDA a mountain of data to review and that takes time.
34885,truer words have not been spoken
34886,"I know this sounds cruel, but some people who are taking every precaution will get this."
34887,Those people should get priority when it comes to medical treatment.
34888,Anyone that ignored the rules should be put at the bottom of the list.
34889,The bot deserved it.
34890,And would you non-bots butt out please?
34891,I’m busy.
34892,Still nothing in South Dakota either.
34893,Governor said again recently she is leaving it up to personal responsibility.
34894,"Yep - conservative messaging is heavily centered around fear, but not so much on actual policy."
34895,Scare the voters into thinking that Joe Biden will usher in an era of communism and degeneracy
34896,"Even with supplies, there will be violence that will occur with some of the more defiant of the populace."
34897,"A lot of people are quite on edge, even before the pandemic."
34898,"Don’t think anyone here would stomach the military effectively inciting a shootout with civilians, even for a lockdown."
34899,"As an English person (whose politics have also in 5 years devolved into nationalism, ""freedom"", disguised bigotry, and the politicisation of events such as coronavirus, my heart goes out to you."
34900,"The Chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, has been begging Congress for months to keep a steady flow of stimulus going."
34901,The threat to our economy is far greater by the lack of federal stimulus than whatever deficit spending stimulus requires.
34902,"We can literally print money, and due to the higher US savings rate we don't need to borrow from the international market."
34903,"But nooooo, let's make it political and fuck over millions of Americans, sounds like a *MUCH* better pan."
34904,[removed]
34905,Is that how it works there?
34906,You can stay open if you sell a certain amount of food?
34907,I know it works that way in other places.
34908,And yet COVID is spreading very fast in the US and daily death counts are quickly rising for the past month.
34909,"Other countries are able to use other means to prevent the disease, but the past 9 months have proven that a vaccine is the only thing that will stop COVID in the US."
34910,I know where you're coming from.
34911,"I'm not traveling for T-day, but am planning to visit family for Christmas."
34912,"Our family is self quarantining before we visit, and we're driving 8 hours straight to get there; only stopping for gas."
34913,Rates of infection are comparable in both locations.
34914,So I don't see how this is any more dangerous than our normal daily lives.
34915,"People talk about it spreading through travel, but if it's already everywhere it's not like there's a risk of bringing it somewhere new."
34916,wearing a mask shouldn't make you suicidal.
34917,but I understand what you are getting at.
34918,if things go really well things could be back to very much normal by this time next year.
34919,but masks are just common sense for a lot of reasons.
34920,Me too.
34921,"I'm assuming to analyze data, although the process would feel more expedient of they simply had rolling meetings and announce a conclusion when they reach one, instead of having this set on an arbitrarily selected date."
34922,"&gt;On Christmas Eve, state health officials in Nebraska [made influenza a mandatory quarantine disease, with fines ranging from $15 to $100 for violations."
34923,"Approximately 1,000 homes in Omaha were placarded, with their occupants unable to leave for at least four days after the fever had subsided."
34924,It's interesting to see how we had more enforcement of pandemics and lockdowns a century ago in this country than we do today.
34925,Well authorities might as well try reverse psychology at this point.
34926,A large team of doctors and scientists need to review the mountain of data that Pfiser is giving to them.
34927,"This takes a long time, and I'm sure they are going as fast as they can."
34928,"Science takes time, and can only be rushed so much."
34929,this
34930,"&gt;I'm not sure why Manzhoul is locked down, possibly its economy is less important to China than Tianjin."
34931,That's exactly the reason why.
34932,Another would be that Tianjin has more resources and ICU beds in case things actually flare up.
34933,As we've seen in the US it's the rural communities that have been hit the hardest.
34934,"Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, HK, ~~Singapore~~

Edit: Singapore can be counted as an island"
34935,Those were different times.
34936,The people actually had the means to rebel back then.
34937,With the kind of weapons the government has now makes it impossible to fight against them.
34938,We wouldn't even be able to mount a rebellion because we have 0 privacy.
34939,Who the fuck gave this the wholesome award?
34940,?
34941,At least they saw the writing on the wall when it gets closer to them.
34942,Imagine how much worse it would be if they were still insistent on wallowing in virus laden environments unmasked and passing it to all and sundry before the fever and shortness of breath sets in.
34943,An 18 hours of exposure is a long time.
34944,No a positive covid test doesn't mean you have to lockdown or cannot socialize
34945,El Paso also takes in some patients from other areas like New Mexico which exacerbates the issue.
34946,"Why do people persist in claiming ""island makes it different""?"
34947,"Countries and states have borders, and you have control of them."
34948,"If you want to limit those crossing them, you can do so."
34949,That's what happened in Australia where states put up limits on people crossing state borders.
34950,Island doesn't come into it.
34951,Remember Australia is as big as the US and also has states - and most of the action was in closing those borders to the real efforts going on internal to those states didn't spill over.
34952,Island isn't really any kind of relevant.
34953,Um... how do they know it was him and he didn't get infected *from* the other passengers?
34954,Sounds like fear mongering.
34955,Yea you can still get mad at the person that lit the house on fire but you should also worry about putting some water on it at some point.
34956,"He shouldn't have that kind of money to begin with, we shouldn't have to rely on the charity of some rich asshole to improve our society."
34957,"Australia has had numerous episodes of community transmission, which we've managed to control."
34958,I mean being an island doesn't matter in those cases
34959,yeah.
34960,um.
34961,they don't care.
34962,"they don't study history, or math, or biology, or logic, or a number of things that would help here."
34963,they just want to be selfish.
34964,I'd say at least 1 in 5 have already had it.
34965,"The state premiers didn't *pressure* the federal government to take covid seriously, the federal government put all of the responsibility onto the states, so they don't need to act on it themselves."
34966,The feds have taken every chance they could to undermine the states on covid (especially if they're a Labor state).
34967,"They don't even have Border Force doing quarantine (one of the things it's meant to do), and instead pushed the states to do their own programs, so if it goes wrong (which it has in multiple states already), Morrison doesn't have to take responsibility."

Help people with stimulus checks, keep rent/mortgages from kicking people out of homes, ensure that they do everything to keep the spread low with lockdowns and masks, and giver our nurses/doctors adequate supplies."

35055,Fewer than 25% of population have the Corona contact tracing app installed.
35056,And in the absence of any other tracking contact tracing relies almost exclusively on people warning others themselves.
35057,Testing is also going to shit.
35058,Germany had 2-3% positive tests in spring.
35059,"It's now up to 9.5%, way more than 5% the WHO recommends to try to achieve."
35060,Therefore you can't even compare numbers to the first wave - not enough testing is being done for the current data to be reliable.
35061,"It's better than, say, Poland with a shattering 45% of positive tests (which makes their covid statistics almost completely meaningless), but Germany is still really failing at responding to the second wave."
35062,At least the vast majority of people actually wear masks around here.
35063,"They've given up and feel they have nothing to lose, unfortunately there's been no effort to give people incentives to continue to make further sacrifices, the morale of a defeated army constantly on retreat"
35064,My girlfriend’s friend lives in Florida.
35065,Every single night she’s at a club/fancy restaurant and it’s full of people.
35066,Then later in the night she’ll be at a crowded apartment or after party that can go all night.
35067,It’s a big fuck you to everyone who is taking this seriously and I really hate how some people act like we’ve done everything we can and the cases are going up so we should open everything back up.
35068,A huge portion of the country isn’t following guidelines at all.
35069,Makes sense.
35070,Thanks for sharing.
35071,"I can sort of see the logic though...it’s not guaranteed they’ll catch COVID at thanksgiving dinner, but they may not live another year anyway - especially if they’re older and not in the greatest health - the risk might be worth it to them."

35087,"From the cdc study linked in the article, The mask mandated counties went from 17 to 16 cases per 100,000."
35088,"The non-mandating counties went from 6 to 12 per 100,000."
35089,So yes at the end the non mask counties were still lower.
35090,That's Reddit for you bro.
35091,My suggestion is to pay more attention to your local situation rather than the world.
35092,Most of this sub's content involves pessimism which is extremely bad for your mental health.
35093,"Just use common sense (mask, social distance) and keep looking ahead to when we're out of this nightmare."

35097,Dude look at vaccine-trust statistics in Europe.
35098,They are not some “enlightened land” that trusts vaccines more than America.
35099,Quite the opposite actually.
35100,"Transfer and graduated pipets, common culture media, staining reagent, the list goes on!"
35101,And that's not even touching actual virology testing kits and reagents.

35112,They probably owned that car BEFORE the pandemic.

35115,Third world shit hole countries  in Asia and Africa are laughing at y'all
35116,"The government initiated the protests by, despite the pandemic, amending the existing legislation and basically banning most of the already limited abortion rights Poland had, so people got pissed."
35117,"However, there was no massive increase in cases during the time of the protests or after."
35118,And the CARES act has run out for millions/will run out within a month.
35119,So all those self employed/independent contractors will no longer be able to claim unemployment at all.
35120,Do what you want within the laws of the states you'll be in.

35125,"If Powell really wants more stimulus a smart move would be for him to come right out and declare a minimum dollar amount of the package (ie: ""no less than $1 trillion"") as this would force McConnell and the Senate Republicans to move on from these absurdly insufficient skinny bills."
35126,"Usually, someone that talks to invisible beings gets confined to a soft room and is not allowed sharp things because of what they might do with them."
35127,How did this nutjob get missed?
35128,Let’s not manipulate people with raw numbers instead of percentages.
35129,"There were 139.9 million people in the US in 1945, we lost \~416,000 OR .29 percent."
35130,If we lose 471k to COVID at a US population of 330 million it is .14 percent.
35131,Buuuut all lives are created equal!?
35132,"Yeah in World War 2 the people who died were young healthy adults, the future of the country."
35133,Covid19 primarily kills the elderly.
35134,There’s a big difference.
35135,How far do you plan to move the goal posts?
35136,8 months of stupidity has resulted in 250K dead Americans.
35137,The most grim predictions have us at 400-500K dead before we're all vaccinated.
35138,And your prediction is 50 million dead in the next 6 weeks?
35139,"I hate thinking of myself as more intelligent than 50% of the population, let alone anyone for that matter because I say and do a lot of stupid shit."
35140,Irregardless...just kidding.

35142,"Shit makes me cringe thinking, ""huh, I'm a fucking genius next to these jackwagon, asshats."""
35143,"Edit: I'm not, nor do I consider myself a genius."
35144,Just using real geniuses as a metaphorical example of how stupid a huge percentage of my fellow countrymen and women are.
35145,Isn't this an apples to oranges comparison though?
35146,It was relatively isolated in Wuhan and the traveling helped spread it where it wasn't previously.
35147,At this point in time the virus is already everywhere.
35148,"Traveling will make it worse, but it's not really comparable to the Wuhan situation."
35149,"Jesus Christ, wtf is wrong with you"
35150,And there's going to be issues vaccinating if too many people are infected.
35151,If the people administering the vaccines start getting sick because people turn up to their vaccine appointment with covid it's going to slow things down.
35152,Is it really?
35153,That's shocking.
35154,But good news.
35155,Even if it comes with the preconditions that you can only use Windows 8 from now on?
35156,"Well, as an immunocompromised person, I'm gonna die."
35157,What should I do with my last few weeks?
35158,I'm leaning towards finding lots of kittens and puppies to pet.
35159,Maybe some bunnies?
35160,Possibly while watching Adventure Time.
35161,We are screwed.
35162,how do they even estimate this....?
35163,"Americans please listen, yeh lockdown is shit."
35164,As an Irish man who cant go to the pub.
35165,I understand that its very unnatural.

35168,New Zealand is real.
35169,You have to stay in a supervised hotel.
35170,"If more people died from it, it wouldn't spread as well."
35171,"My grocery shopping has changed zero, because I've been on the delivery trend since it showed up."
35172,I had haaate grocery shopping.
35173,But my poor 80 year old dad finally retired and he's been so bored.
35174,"Grocery shopping was his daily excitement and now I'm standing in front of the door like... ""I will tie you to a chair""."
35175,It's hard to change habits!
35176,But we will get through this and you and he will be back to daily shops soon!
35177,"Deaths are a measure of deaths, nothing more."
35178,Cases dropped dramatically after June 18th.
35179,Ramping up testing doesn’t make cases drop.
35180,It would mean more cases would be found if they existed.
35181,"Of course social distancing works, that’s what caused cases to drop."
35182,Trump is incompetent.
35183,The next Trumpist likely won’t be.

35187,I think that why they put it in quotes.
35188,"Because it's an artificial need, created only by the shitty system in the USA."
35189,"No one really ""needs"" to work if they're happy with not having much, except in the USA, where people have to work so that they can have healthcare."
35190,"Whether or not what you've said is true, how is that relevant to what Americans are doing now?"
35191,"You know, many months after this started?"
35192,You're probably not sitting facing them 2 feet away talking and laughing for 3 hours.
35193,the vaccines should be thoroughly tested in a controlled environment before being used by the public

35204,"Now its ""Prove you caught it at work""....and the courts are accepting it, giving all employers all the immunity they need."
35205,I'm not saying that the US should follow Chinas response.
35206,"However, basic measures such as wearing masks, lockdowns, testing were completely Ignored in one of the world's wealthiest nations."
35207,I also brought up SK as an example of a successful response.
35208,Yup.
35209,I feel we greatly overreacted to 9/11 after seeing how little we care over 80 times the number of deaths.
35210,"We didn't see a spike from the riots, surprisingly enough."
35211,"Agree that it's a stupid thing to do in these times, but many states did indeed stay home for months (NY'er here... we definitely did, masks, social distancing and everything)."
35212,I think most countries have a small minority of anti-maskers... it's just that unfortunately our current president is fueling that fire.
35213,I'm sure the people you will kill are also comfortable with your choice.
35214,Do you know that the virus spreads?
35215,"Editing: Why the hell did I said 300,00 world wide?"
35216,... no idea... but yea... what u/nedonedonedo said.

35220,Am I the only one who finds the current wave a bit less terrifying than April now that we know what we’re dealing with?
35221,"Yeah, this all sounds like everything that would be played on one particular channel on TV in the US..."
35222,Hard to say.
35223,I mean Fauci himself thinks next winter will be pretty much back to normal and many experts think this summer will be close to normal.
35224,So chances are you could have a normal wedding next October.
35225,However there are still too many questions and not any of the answers we have now are set in stone.
35226,"If I were you, I would plan on having a normal wedding but keep plan for contingencies in case we are still dealing with outbreaks."
35227,How many patents does this guy have concerning Coronavirus?
35228,His conflict of interest statement would be a mile long.
35229,"Yes, but it’s been shown that high cycle thresholds could pick up virus fragments that would not be enough to be infectious and may also result in someone being asymptomatic because they have so little active virus in their body."
35230,"Yeah, Easter 2022 maybe"
35231,"Hoover institute, a public policy think tank."
35232,"Can't fool me, that's where the kraken lives."
35233,A million a day easily.
35234,"50 million travel, they will be staying with and having dinner with many more than that."
35235,100+ million will be around these travellers for sure.
35236,"Then they all go home, after picking up the virus from family and spreading it in airports again, to their normal life and keep spreading."
35237,This is like when the WW1 soldiers spread the spanish flu
35238,Most people are very poor at assessing risk.
35239,The survival rates are staggering low considering how easily the virus is to catch.
35240,I couldn’t care less if I have a 99.9% chance of survival that 0.1 is still too high of a risk of dying.
35241,Ignoring the dangers of actually having longterm damage from the virus despite surviving.

35246,We very literally do not care about each other at all.
35247,*Laughs in American healthcare worker*  I'm in danger.
35248,I feel that's slightly misleading.
35249,"Vermont, for example, has been far and above safer than other places."
35250,"Like, looking at numbers now, it's definitely better than Hawaii, even if numbers were growing marking it a ""hotspot""."
35251,It still had lower numbers than Hawaii.
35252,"That said, Hawaii is by and large doing better than most of the states, so it doesn't break your point."
35253,"I just don't know how truthful it is to say it's doing ""a lot"" better absolutely every other state"
35254,Word is insurance companies are trying to get covid labeled as pre-existing condition if you get it as well.
35255,So not only are employeers not liable but if that happens you're going to see future health care claims denied as well meaning you're ip shit creek if someone that ends up with health issues because of covid.
35256,What site do you watch?
35257,"Contagion has a happy ending though, completely fabricated bullshit nonsense (not really, the movie is scarily accurate)"
35258,Human to human transmission was confirmed about 1 week before Chinese new year.
35259,The chinese gov still managed to limit (relatively speaking) the people travelling from/through Wuhan down from the original estimate of 15 mil.
35260,Now fast forward 11 months apparently not many people left the denial stage.
35261,The US is planning on a similar timeline.
35262,Fauci said April last week.
35263,You know that the most interesting thing is how much people said then matches what people are saying now.
35264,Then again it shows what we have to look forward to.
35265,We are already seeing the start of the annual journey home.
35266,We know what comes next.
35267,What can you do?
35268,Short of physical force you can't stop it.
35269,I meant few months in the sense it’s short lasting like two-three months.
35270,That article just supports the main point I was getting at which is that it’s probably longer lasting than we think.
35271,The comment was addressing the claim that you can just celebrate another day...
35272,It's a valid response.
35273,"Yeah you’re right, you’re a bunch of imbeciles who have nothing better to do than to spread a potentially life threatening disease instead of staying home."
35274,"Jesus Christ, how are people this ignorant like you able to live in todays Society?"
35275,?
35276,"Remember all those other things that were said by the media, only for them to end up not being true?"

35281,Exactly this.
35282,Leadership's response to the pandemic feels a lot like a cull.
35283,Thanks.
35284,It’s fascinating to me to read about this approach.
35285,Huh?
35286,"You do realize that you can order online from grocery stores and the employees will put together your order for you to either pickup or have delivered, and they can do that without having to go into the public area of the grocery store."
35287,"Or in my case, they put the bags together overnight when the store is closed and they are doing the restocking."
35288,"And yes, the unfortunate reality is that the vast majority of us need to ""hole up at home"", but we can't really exist without grocery stores and their employees."
35289,"Of course they should get paid more, hopefully the $15 minimum wage will happen."
35290,"I know there are other systems where you are paying a gig employee to go shop for you, like Uber Eats or whatever, but Krogers are almost everywhere in this country under some name or another and they all offer contactless pickup."
35291,"Place your order online, come in the next morning and a dude loads your trunk up, already paid online."
35292,So you think the European citizens who have no desire to get the vaccine will suddenly be on board with some government initiative?
35293,The people who don’t want the vaccine aren’t listening to any government protocols
35294,Covid tests shouldn't be used that way.
35295,"The quick ones aren't that accurate, it you aren't showing symptoms there is a good chance you test negative, although not always."

35510,Loaded immediately for me.
35511,Though I wouldn't complain when you didn't want to do any of the work yourself.

35539,This is why we keep having problems.
35540,"I've already lost one person I know to covid, and friends and family I know across the world have had neighbors die to this disease too."
35541,This is not a joke.
35542,I wish more people would take it seriously.
35543,This was a single place.
35544,I bet you could find places that would allow themselves to be locked down right now too.
35545,"But most won’t, and most didn’t then, either."
35546,The excess deaths in the us is already over 300k and that was a couple weeks ago.
35547,I'd be more inclined to accept an excess death count over a verified covid death count just because if a hospital is full of covid patients and someone dies of a heart attack that should count as a covid death too.
35548,"We're going to finish out this year with 500k+ excess deaths, I have no doubt."
35549,And next year will probably be the same if the vaccine rolls out.
35550,Without vaccine that will probably be double or more.
35551,"Lots of that out there, eh?"
35552,Some of us are just ignorant and selfish.
35553,Maybe but definitely not big enough to impose any kind of restrictions.
35554,I think it’ll just be small endemic waves like the flu starting next fall.
35555,Add all the vacationers to your list.
35556,I’m really tired of anti-maskers being the only people to get shit for spreading covid.
35557,"Where I live has seen record tourism this year, and no, they’re not just a bunch of anti-maskers."
35558,"Everyone seems to justify whatever the fuck they’re doing because they’re wearing a mask, and then just blame anti-maskers."

35605,The fact of the matter is that the virus will be dangerous until herd immunity can be achieved.
35606,That may take more time in a place like the USA for a number of reasons but it WILL end.

35632,Why hasn’t that reoccurred if it’s simply the result of being an island?
35633,"Tbh the biggest difference by far is having enough resources dedicated to contact tracing, and a public that’s generally comfortable with making sacrifices such as a temporary lockdown for long term benefits like the freedom to attend large events without risk of exposure"

35654,"If you were driving there wouldn't be that big of a problem in my opinion, as long as you weren't meeting like 20 people."
35655,The problem is that all it takes is for 1 or 2 people on your airplane to have it and they could easily spread it to so many people on the plane.
35656,"If cases are low, then the chance of those 1 or 2 people having it is quite low."
35657,But we have been ramping up so much that the odds of someone on your plane having Covid is probably pretty high.
35658,"Not automatic, but decently high."
35659,This is all just hypothesizing though.

35683,"The numbers are almost certainly going to shoot up like crazy after this (which is what happened in Canada during our October Thanksgiving, and now the Toronto area is going back into March-level lockdowns a month later - we still haven't recovered because we went from a few hundred a day to close to 1,500 a day)."

35717,I’m in Australia and we had some mass shootings and after the Port Arthur massacre our government banned a lot of guns and put restrictions on the sales of the others and we haven’t had a massacre since 1996 .
35718,I’m in Victoria and we are just coming out of a 3 month lockdown but we have had no cases or deaths in 23 days .

35798,"This is the sad part, even those who tried to take strict precautions."
35799,"By my calculations, we were going to pass 500,000 infected daily by next Saturday, without accounting for Thanksgiving."
35800,We're at 1 infected per 150 people in the US.
35801,That's roughly 1 person per a small suburban neighborhood.
35802,"Fully expect that we'll have 1 person infected per suburban block, by first week of December unless we go full lockdown soon."

35817,"idk, most of our shop wasn't wearing one."
35818,"Not because they didn't understand, but because it was hot af and it was a hassle."
35819,Then we got a positive case in our shop and now everyone's wearing a mask without complaint.
35820,I think it just has to hit a little closer to home for some people to realize.
35821,"It say at least 6 months, not at most 6 months."
35822,"At least means ""this much, or more."""
35823,They only have data for 6 months so they can't say it lasts longer.

35825,What pictures are those?
35826,I had to travel for work this past week and the 4 airports i was in had really strict mask usage.

35842,A zoom ICU Christmas and zoom funeral.
35843,I'd say we are about half passed fucked at this point.
35844,It's even more startling when you realize that a lot of the problems with the response are baked into the American form of government.
35845,"We have a decentralized federalist system that privileges states' autonomy and is distrustful of coordinated national action, especially regarding things like public health, safety and restrictions on civil liberties."
35846,"What we're really seeing here I think, is a kind of natural selection for forms of government and societal organization, where some governments are ""adapted"" to deal with a national health crisis requiring a centralized response, and some are not."

35859,We've been dealt the filthy hand of capitalist greed and we all get out of bed each day reciting what works for us.
35860,Blaming the working class is an exercise in moral superiority... and futility.
35861,"You gotta look up, not down to find the real cause of this suffering."
35862,And why is it important?
35863,"Well, it's important because only collective reckoning with that corporate greed will engender revolution in our society."
35864,"Otherwise, we are just dividing ourselves further."
35865,"I could drive, but it’s an under 2 hour flight vs 15 hours driving."

35885,"was it individual income, wages, or disposable income?"
35886,"True, and I respectfully and humbly took the time to read your message and understand your viewpoint."
35887,"But at the same time, by the Government's logic, I could do everything right and go out to the grocery store for essentials and inadvertently catch COVID from the guy in front of me."

35899,They ran multiple steps simultaneously.
35900,They don’t normally do that because of very high financial risks and costs.

36625,"Ask Nurses, “I can’t breath” happens to people without a boot on their neck too!"

36629,"So step 1, be a small island with strictly controlled immigration."
36630,"Right, of course that 40 million is just the initial - everyone who wants one will be able to get vaccinated, the point is that it will take until late Winter/early Spring."
36631,"Over here in Turkey we are approaching 6k reported cases a day and people are getting concerned, new lockdowns are being put in place etc."
36632,Crazy what's happening in America.
36633,"Crazier I'll be flying there soon, it's kinda scary!"
36634,"Effects of 1918 was indeed amplified because of millions of people traveling across the globe, albeit it was not for fun or pleasure, it was the first world war and they were soldiers under orders."

36658,"Plus, the vitamins probably absorb better than they do in pill form."
36659,"The up and up brand I bought last from Target has 1000mg C, 25mcg D, and 10mg Zinc."

36668,I'm having a traditional Thanksgiving...with me and my spouse and kids...we are still going to make a turkey breast and have traditional side dishes and stuff..
36669,This is almost an argument against the death penalty right here.
36670,"People don’t give a shit about the reaper these days, my Lord."
36671,Sweden has very low rates of wearing masks.
36672,I'm not even concerned about protecting people from themselves anymore.
36673,They don't deserve concern.
36674,I am 100% worried about protecting the people who are being safe from the people who are being reckless.
36675,"If the only people who got sick or died were the ones who didn't wear masks and who packed together, fine, that's on them."
36676,But that's not how this one works and I'm so pissed.
36677,My local city hospitals are starting to get filled with people from the outer regions who refused to wear friggin masks.
36678,We aint going anywhere until the vaccine is out and deployed.
36679,Or we reach the immunity otherwise.
36680,Until then all we do or do not is merely postponing the inevitable.
36681,And what we do or do not is not gonna affect the vaccination speed in any way.

36698,"“We blame the people who have been in charge for decades and who refused to be stewards of the country’s well being”
There is a word for those people: Boomers."
36699,That makes sense.

36701,"&gt;	“We have to remember that the virus does not care that it is the holidays, that you are family, and that you have already gone a long time without seeing one another."
36702,"If given opportunities to spread, the virus will spread,” he said."
36703,The novel coronavirus also did not care that across the nation lots of people were protesting and rallying with little to no social distancing or any masks.
36704,"The social protests were one of the worst super spreaders up to date, but no one wants to talk about it because the objective was a huge social issue in American policing."

36711,You can't go beyond a 100 percent positivity rate.
36712,Not that I'm aware of but at least some of the participants must have had it before the trials without realizing.
36713,Political pressure forced the governor to do it.
36714,"Because the Republicans worship death or something, idk."
36715,I’m just in aw at how awful things are for you guys.
36716,I’m in Canada and our gov has made sure people can get a type of unemployment.
36717,"So you don’t have enough hours for normal unemployment, there’s a program to make you eligible.. self employed ppl don’t get the same advantages as ppl who aren’t, there’s a program for that, kids school shut down and a parent needs to quit or take time off to be with their kids, there’s a program for that."
36718,Basically  relates to you not being able to work our gov has tried to put in every scenario and make a program for that.
36719,"We had a more universal benefit from literally March, $2,000 a month every month."
36720,It ended in sept and then all the other new programs rolled out so if you were still out of work or became out of work due to covid you can still get something.
36721,Now it’s paid every other week at $900 bucks.
36722,"Only reason the newer programs is a bit less then the first program is the first one wasn’t taxed, so ppl will feel that tax time, and the newer programs are taxed so you get a bit less which most ppl prefer anyways."
36723,"It’s not perfect and there are always ppl who fall through the cracks, but seriously I don’t know how we would be getting by without it."
36724,You guys in the states need something like this.
36725,"Like you all got $1,200 payment and we’ve had access to 2k a month since March and still going."
36726,"I couldn’t imagine losing work due to covid and only getting $1,200 once just cuz I’m self employed or someone that doesn’t qualify for unemployment."
36727,I really hope something changes for you guys.
36728,"If you are going to be paying students less I hope college is also free in this scenario, and that is also likely illegal age discrimination."

36741,"EVERY SINGLE ONE of them is over the age of 50, with co-existing conditions (obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, etc...) this has been the case by-and-large since the beginning."
36742,"If anyone needs a vaccine it is the elderly, especially the elderly with poor health."
36743,Nobody under the age of 50 NEEDS a vaccine.
36744,It's just that simple.
36745,Especially the first round.
36746,"Now, doctors and nurses, etc... get a higher level of exposure (viral load) and a consideration could be made for this group, but other than that it's just simply not that virulent and deadly."
36747,"I had it in March, and granted it sucked for about 5 weeks, but I was never in fear of dying or in need of substantial medical care."
36748,"And i'm in the group I just mentioned, high exposure, high viral load."
36749,Reddit tends to see Europe as superior to the US and China as the new superpower.
36750,Economically the USA has a major poverty problem.
36751,"However, it has a richer middle class than Europe."
36752,"By and large Europeans live urban, rent their dwellings, often don’t own cars or own one small car."
36753,"Yes, their uni is cheap and their healthcare is covered."
36754,But their wealth is much less.
36755,I forget the site/source with the exact stats.
36756,"But the average middle class French is as rich as Alabama, Spain is to Louisiana, etc

These are amongst the poorest US states."
36757,"Look at healthcare, the salaries are staggering."
36758,"Reddit will often say “yeah but no healthcare”...healthcare for a family of 3 is typically $800-$1,000/month-ish."
36759,Which is high...but it’s seen as almost like a tax.
36760,"This debate could go on, this is your blah blah blah."
36761,But how many teachers in Europe who aren’t from money retire to a $480k house on 4 acres in the mountains?
36762,How many principals live in a $800k house on the lake?
36763,Doctors make more than double in many areas.
36764,"This is your blah blah, this is a longer debate."
36765,My point is...it’s just a pro/con.
36766,USA is turning into a tale of two peoples.
36767,Corona has amplified it so much too.
36768,But to me the European lifestyle isn’t superior to the American.
36769,"As for China, it’s still largely a paper Tiger."
36770,I’m curious as to in what exact ways you see China surpassing the rest of the world.
36771,Militarily?
36772,Diplomaticly?
36773,Technologically?
36774,Economically?
36775,They are still pegging their currency to be the factory of the world.
36776,They are still developing that middle class.
36777,Whats the plan when they want basic rights?
36778,What’s the plan when you tell them they can’t invest it in American real estate?
36779,I think the USA and China can and should peacefully co-exist.
36780,We can and should work together.
36781,We can be stronger that way.
36782,That is exactly what happened!

36792,50% of people voted for trump so is this really a surprise?
36793,Idiots.
36794,I would love to see this interview.
36795,"go home 98, you're drunk."
36796,I live with my grandparents and even though my grandparents do believe in covid and all that and they have been doing instacart I think or grocery pickup they have also started going back to church (I knew it was a matter of time before they went back can't keep them away from that damn place) and they are doing Thanksgiving because God forbid we just don't celebrate it.
36797,I really don't see the big deal over it.
36798,Who cares if we don't have Thanksgiving?
36799,Why do we need to have it that bad when all this is going on?
36800,But they also would get upset with me if they knew I went to the mall to go buy a pair of jeans.
36801,None of it makes sense with them.
36802,Having land borders must be the reason why we (Germany) kept our airports open until after the virus arrived and did not even recommend quarantine.
36803,Sweden's borders are essentially closed - by their neighbors.
36804,Pro sports teams as well.
36805,I live in the US and also got one for free.
36806,Thanks for trying to gloat.

36808,Do you all think maybe racism is an indicator for psychopathy?
36809,"I don’t mean passive racism, like disliking foreigners, I mean hating your neighbors."
36810,Is that why a good 30% of Americans all want other people to die?
36811,Because there’s a pretty big overlap between racists and covid deniers in the USA at least.
36812,You really can't make up the sheer stupidity of Americans...

36933,Exactly.
36934,"And those people who still have to work could then quarantine, even if they had to do it in groups and take turns."
36935,The work load for hospitals would go down if people weren't getting sick so there would be more capacity to allow gross of healthcare workers to quarantine.
36936,Oh it’s slightly lower than Fridays we must be rounding the corner now /s

36946,But the majority would struggle to find a fish completely on their own.

36948,Dunning Krueger is definitely a problem here in the US.

36958,Is that a bad sign?
36959,"A few months ago my spouse and I went to the same place for testing and got our negative results back at the same time, so that’s why I’m nervous."
36960,"Well, correct me if I'm wrong, but if the vaccine is really 95% efficient, then I believe vaccinating 70% of the population should be enough and even a lower percentage like 50 to 60% should be sufficient to significantly slow the spread down or bring it to a halt."
36961,"Point is, what is most important right now is adult compliance."
36962,"Yeah, when I first heard the story I was like WTF, how was he speeding, there weren't even cars invented yet!"
36963,But nature finds a way.
36964,Seems you've been fed lots of lies about China.
36965,There's no point talking sense to you.
36966,Same here.
36967,Have the entire week off.
36968,Beautiful weather and a to go thanksgiving dinner reserved on thanksgiving.
36969,At least I’m like you.
36970,The weather here is going to be beautiful.
36971,Consolation prize.
36972,I’m so pissed at all these morons.
36973,"Our government hasn't done a damn thing to protect us, to help us or to mitigate this problem."
36974,"We've been told to ignore it, 'it is what it is', to stop being lazy and work."
36975,"And now, people are surprised that Americans are traveling for a holiday?"
36976,Our government has the audacity to NOW try and maybe do something???
36977,"My fucking school didn't care when I got covid, many of my coworkers think its fake or a bad cold."
36978,"Nobody helped me when I got it, so I dont really respect any action my government takes now."
36979,"I won't go to Thanksgiving because I'm still sick (its been 3 fucking weeks mind you), but this suprise people are traveling is mind boggling."
36980,"We've been forced to work through a fucking pandemic, people are going to do what they want now."
36981,Significantly less than 1%.
36982,But that's not a reason to not give a fuck about it.
36983,That’s definitely a false positive.
36984,"All Covid outbreaks are charted by an excess of deaths, as its novel, highly transmissible, and directly causes deaths in individuals who otherwise would not have died soon."
36985,Doubling rate of confirmed positive cases right now is right around 18 days.
36986,That puts us around 350k/day dec 10 and 700k by December 28.
36987,Not sure how big a bump will be caused by Xmas and thanksgiving but the already exponential increase is going to be very high.
36988,"Yep: Dr Fauci pretty much said this is exponential spread now, and we are all in for a very bad time, Dec-Feb. 

As long as supply lines hold up — druggists stay stocked, and grocery stores — I feel I can hunker down and stay safe."
36989,"If those fail though, it will get ugly."
36990,And for all those relying on the unemployment that ends right after Christmas: 🙏
36991,South.
36992,Same.
36993,"There's someone posted at the entrance to tell people to put it on, but once the customer is 5 steps in they take it off."
36994,"I think the employees are tired of getting into fights about it, and I can't blame them."
36995,Complaince has been pretty good here but there are definitely people who DGAF.
36996,"We have a statewide mask mandate but it has no fines, no punishments, no consequences..."
36997,It's really more of a suggestion than anything.
36998,I feel like some teeth would help.
36999,Wow I was kidding but okay.
37000,"I don’t even have money for a motel room for Thanksgiving, noooooo worries about making poor investment choices here."
37001,"As a cashier who has been essential through all this year, I think it's safe to say we are royally boned."
37002,"We have tried to tell folk an uncountable amount of times that this was coming, but they just do not care."
37003,"At this point and time, I am sick of screaming at them to avoid the storm."
37004,Is this what Cassandra of Troy felt as her people drug in that cursed wooden horse from the Greeks?
37005,"I do not know, and sadly, I am now I am inclined to morbidly just sit back and watch my home country get consumed."
37006,We shall reap what we have sown.
37007,Gods above help us poor fools.
37008,Be safe.

37012,"Lol 

They questioned his credibility to make statements like this and I clarified his position in the medical world to help them understand why he is in fact, very credible in making claims like this."
37013,But if you would like any further clarification please feel free to ask.
37014,Honest question because some of my friends have COVID now and I’m wondering about seeing them in the future.
37015,Why are you still skipping the holidays if you had it already?
37016,Doesn’t that mean you’re immune and can’t get it/transmit it anymore?
37017,I know there’s been cases of people getting it twice but I thought that it’s still considered very rare.

37024,We are as well.
37025,"We live 15 minutes from my senior parents, so we are staying home to be able to keep seeing them."
37026,Restaurants and parties can wait.
37027,"Isn’t it crazy how we have internet, Netflix, food delivery, etc."
37028,and people are being spoiled brats about staying home?
37029,"We are our own worst enemies, aren’t we?"
37030,"Yes, I remember this- the ""very bad as an adult"" thing."
37031,I had two rounds of it and I don't know why.
37032,"One quite young, and one a little older."
37033,The second round was a smidge worse.
37034,Thankfully I was still young.
37035,"I had heard of these older cases, and remember feeling kinda relieved that I got it when I did."
37036,"My parents weren't social enough for some party, and there wasn't a point, because if someone brought it to school.... Well.... Everyone pretty much got it."

37043,We don't need to vaccinate everyone.
37044,We need to vaccinate enough to slow the spread to very manageable number
37045,Gonna be a lot of Holly Jolly Funerals
37046,The issue is that people are talking about temperature as if it matters to the virus.
37047,Of course they are.
37048,And they are prioritizing their own livelihoods and enjoyment.
37049,"I imagine there are at least a few fat, old bigots that are just ready to go out guns blazing

37061,"Victoria is currently relevant on a world scale because they curbed uncontrolled spread down to zero, which kind of gives people in hotspots hope."

37071,"let’s golfing, shall we?"
37072,It was a joke.
37073,"Those videos are beautiful, but in my opinion are bad educational materials."
37074,"For the sake of  reducing barriers to accessibility (like lots of jargon), they put up barriers of comprehension (like misusing jargon)."
37075,I've been introduced to a few topics because of those videos; but they're I think most useful as introductions.
37076,That's whats going to happen.
37077,If it hits 200k a day they'll start implementing things.
37078,"I've already personally noticed st press briefings them encouraging hand washing, soicsl distancing and mask wearing if needed (Albeit they are never wearing masks) and trump is at least pretending covid is resl because he ""attended"" the g20 summit."
37079,You can read it.
37080,I posted the archive link and the study they were discussing.
37081,I don’t think they know how long masks were off for eating.
37082,Now that is funny.
37083,Are you being sarcastic or just absolutely blind to the contradictions in the one sentence.
37084,"""I am not against vaccines, I am just against getting the vaccine..."""
37085,I heard UAL cancellations were up overall as well.
37086,In what sense?
37087,"Yup, same."
37088,Thanksforgiving us the virus y'all
37089,We're proudly Asian now.
37090,Same here.
37091,"My boss is Covid+, was at work last week while he was obviously sick, and stood at our desks with his mask down to sign paperwork for 10-15 minutes."
37092,We take papers in and out of his office with him in it (no mask on) all day.
37093,The nurse in the office next to him is out with covid.
37094,"My coworker started showing symptoms and got tested, and management is angry about it."
37095,They don’t want us reporting symptoms or getting tested.
37096,"We are now only allowed to see 2 providers in the office if we feel sick, because the now “unapproved” providers are following guidelines and testing."
37097,"everyone is so smart, lets stop arguing over who is doing better, we can do that in 2 years when we have all the data."
37098,right now were still in the middle of this.
37099,like a bunch of firefighters arguing while stood in the middle of a burning house.
37100,jesus.
37101,I looked at the Washington State draft plan and it seemed like there was still a lot to be ironed out.
37102,"For example, how do you determine who is most at risk due to comorbidities."
37103,"According to the plan, 3 million people in the state have comorbidities, so what are the thresholds for those people?"
37104,Is there a database that can sort those comorbidities so you can arrive at a number that matches how many doses the state will receive?
37105,"And with unequal access to health care, how do factor in the people who have serious comorbidities but don’t have a medical record trail that shows this?"
37106,This is going to be a big challenge for every state and it could get ugly.
37107,the funny thing is they absolutely can tell them to leave.
37108,they are private businesses and you can always tell someone to GTFO your private businesses.
37109,it's absolutely 100% a lie that they 'can't' tell them to leave.

37115,So you have some evidence that the virus mutates to be less contagious in the heat?
37116,Because that’s what you need to prove it has anything to do with seasonality.
37117,Or is it just common sense that it spreads more when people are inside.
37118,Thought I saw something where they were paying people to attend.
37119,"We had to fly SFO to PHX to MIA on American Airlines, I didn't see anyone without a mask on and there was no food/drink service other than individual ziplocs with a water and some cookies they handed out as you boarded."

37129,My choice of wording may have been inapt.
37130,I generally agree with you.
37131,"However there are examples of democracies which don’t have very many liberties (like Singapore) and places with amazing civil liberties that lack democracy (Hong Kong, ranked the freest place in the world ten year running)."
37132,So the picture is not as black and white as you are understanding it.
37133,I’m not right in the head?
37134,All three of those people used democracy to amass power and political legitimacy.

37146,Enjoying the lifting of most restrictions in the next month here in Australia.
37147,Sydney has had 14 days free of new cases.
37148,Melbourne (which had a second outbreak and was up to 730 new cases per day) has gone 21 days.

37183,"Actually, I just looked at it, and India is the only one that stands out now."
37184,"They have 133,000 deaths with 9.1 million cases, which would equate to about 172,000 if they had the same number of cases as the U.S."
37185,I find that surprising as I'd think the U.S. facilities would be as good or better than India's (on average).
37186,It's possible that this is simpler due to India having a higher percentage of younger people than other countries.
37187,"It just goes to show how deeply ingrained the anti socialism goes here, even though so many already benefit from taxpayer funded programs and infrastructure."

37189,I gotta assume that that’s something their prediction already accounted for?
37190,"Some schools will straight up not tell teachers a kid tested positive, because that would mean having to send a whole class/floor home, and we can't have *that*..."
37191,What you are saying is in line with common thought (I stated initially I felt i was in the minority) and syncs with early statements from epidemiologists and other infectious disease professionals ([https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(20)30032-2/fulltext](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(20)30032-2/fulltext)).
37192,"If you read the Lancet article, you can see several early assumptions have shown to be incorrect/misleading."
37193,Given this is the seventh known Coronavirus that has undergone zoonotic transfer we have a fairly solid understanding of the primary sources and points of exposure.
37194,Similar to other respiratory viruses there are known likely sources; this is how they were able to predict that we would get hit sooner or later.
37195,Further study of species that carry coronaviruses and the viruses themselves is important to mitigate further outbreaks as well as limiting human/animal interactions at high risk spots.
37196,It doesn't matter if it's bats in South America or bats in China likewise  camels in in Saudi Arabia or Iran... they all pose risks.
37197,"That said, if you look at the geopolitical blowback from the finger pointing at China such as the removal of funding to study coronaviruses in Wuhan (US pulled funding) I feel it becomes apparent that looking for the exact origin is more a de facto witch hunt that is counterproductive to science in the current climate."
37198,Further there is no guarantee that future events will follow the same path as the current virus outbreak (i.e.
37199,MERS) so learning likely vectors is of more use than one specific origin IMO.
37200,**TLDR**; yes you need to explain to me how knowing whether it's city A vs city B in the current environment helps prevent the emergence of  Covid 20**27** or H1N1 Bird Flu 20**31** when it results in finger pointing and reduced funding?
37201,I'm all for studying zoonotic sources (i.e.
37202,"bats, camels, civets, etc) and the mechanisms of transfer; but the blame game hinders science."
37203,You literally said you don't know that we're doing pretty damn well in deaths per capita.
37204,"Oh I see what you're doing, you want to believe that our country is grossly overstating COVID deaths."
37205,"I was going to ask you where you felt the ""straight dope"" comes from but now I don't care what you think."
37206,You're mad because this self-organizing social network bursts the bubble you want.
37207,"I would love to be a mask enforcement agent, kicking people out of grocery stores for not wearing masks."
37208,"Hell, I'd even do it for minimum wage because I honestly love going off on people for not wearing masks and do it every single time I get the chance

I have gone off on strangers a couple hundred times."
37209,"No, I've never been assaulted in any way."
37210,Mostly they get mad and stammer and walk away.
37211,"Sometimes they try to go complain to staff, who tell them to put their mask on or get out."
37212,Sometimes they put their masks on.
37213,It's crazy to me that we're all literally living in abject fear of these people to the point that you won't even tell people to put their mask on around the food you're buying because of...what?
37214,You think they're gonna pull a knife or a gun on you in fucking wal mart?
37215,Get real dude.
37216,But they say mass deaths are a hoax.
37217,You die with covid not because of and to them they always choose the lowest death count percentage possible to downplay.
37218,I colored by numbers for you in my other reply.
37219,Pfizer said they'll have 50 million doses by themselves so 25 million people.
37220,Add the other vaccine and I think we're at 40 million
37221,But still in the wrong.
37222,I know 250k sounds like a lot but where is the heart break for the 500k+ annually from heart disease?

37225,My point was it wasn’t only due to democracy.
37226,The other person was overstating it.
37227,As a gamer your analogy is hilarious.
37228,I just moved away from hattiesburg to Utah and it's like I moved to a different country altogether.
37229,I went to the asian grocery store earlier (which by the way was literally 10-20 times bigger than the one in hattiesburg) and literally every single person in there - a couple hundred - was wearing masks and were very obviously being careful to not be too close to other people.
37230,Not even any dicknosing or chinstrapping - NONE.
37231,And it's like that nearly everywhere I go.
37232,People are walking around on the street alone with their masks on.
37233,Driving around in their cars with their masks on.
37234,Even riding bikes on mountain trails - wearing masks.
37235,People in south mississippi by contrast are as bad as you say.
37236,We were petrified to go anywhere or do anything in hattiesburg because everyone we knew was still posting big maskless group pics with their friends at bars every night of the week.
37237,"People BRAGGED about not wearing masks, and made fun of people who did."
37238,I know it's not everyone in ms but quite frankly it's most of them.

37272,"I actually tried to ask /r/neutralpolitics if Bernie would have done better than Biden, and they went full SCREECH at me for DARING to ask a question without citing things, and it was CLEARLY not neutral because I asked about the liberal party specifically (wtf?)"
37273,"but I'm super curious, with the post-election breakdown and how close it was... would Sanders have made it more a landslide, or a total loss?"
37274,Lol.
37275,"So much to fit in an anonymous social media shit posting antisocial media platform, so little time..

High, not drunk."
37276,"And not single, but the concern is appreciated lol

TLDR: I'm pissed and annoyed at the cognitive dissonance that will see the 22% of hospitals currently facing critical staff shortages rise to nearly 100% by NYE because ""fuck yo grandma, I got pumpkin pie to eat while I assuage my avoidant narcissistic ass with turkey stuffing""

If you need me to spell out the correlation between dating app statistics and what that means for the societal pools ability to be empathic with no reward, then guess what demographic you belong to in that 80/20 chart?"

37300,Give manufacturing consent a read sometime if you really believe people *want* to return to the status quo that has devastated the working class so much so that a fascist was elected 4 years ago.
37301,"Who people vote for is divorced from their material interests by design, indeed our education and broader culture does its best to make sure we in the working class can't even *recognize* or properly value our own material interests."
37302,"One simple example, the media outlets in this country that reach hundreds of millions?"
37303,They are all owned by the absurdly wealthy whose class interests are diametrically opposed to yours and they spent billions in air time attacking the candidate who posed a threat to their material interests.

37323,Mask use universally lowers this virus' reproduction number.
37324,"If a hundred people have a virus, and the R0 is 1.5 without masks and 0.9 with masks, then a mask mandate means the different between ~200 people getting infected vs. the entire planet getting infected."
37325,US counties with mask mandates have had dramatically reduced spread compared to otherwise similar counties with no mandates.

37331,"There is no need to vaccinate children, they aren’t transmission vectors as has been proven in a multitude of studies now."

37345,This pandemic gave everyone a chance to reset their lives.
37346,I no longer drink booze or smoke cigarettes.
37347,I now work out regularly and lift weights.
37348,When the pandemic is over I will come out of this a better and healthier person.
37349,I can't understand how more people aren't using this moment as a silver lining for their lives.
37350,"I don't see why people are surprised at this, haven't we proven how selfish the human man is thoughout the centuries."
37351,History just keeps repeating itself.
37352,&gt;Workers who handle the packaging at the port can get exposed that way.
37353,Then they should keep their hands away from their faces until after they wash them.
37354,That's basic pandemic hygiene.
37355,I was a poll worker/volunteer.
37356,Everyone who voted handed me their paper voting pass.
37357,I handled them with my bare hands.
37358,I didn't care.
37359,My hands weren't getting anywhere near my face until I washed them.
37360,"That's not how immunization works though and will have cause problems to others around them, family, health workers, hospitals all get put at risk when people don't vaccine."

37363,Honestly - for me it’s the extreme cold that makes the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines so difficult to put into wide spread use.
37364,"Hospitals, research universities/institutions, big tech/pharma/biotech - sure they can figure it out since they already have the cryogenic storage and ability to track down their people for the second dose."
37365,I suspect the Astra Zeneca vaccine will soon be approved and that it will be the first choice until the Jansen (J&amp;J) vaccine gets approval.
37366,I don’t think the one vs two dose part will be the biggest differentiator compared to the ease of transport and storage the viral vector vaccines have.
37367,This is assuming the viral vector vaccines also have high efficacy.
37368,If their efficacy is much lower than that is a different.
37369,BTW: I joined the (J&amp;J) trial last week.
37370,Fingers crossed I got the vaccine and not the placebo AND that it works!
37371,So far  haven’t had any ill effects other than typical vaccine soreness.
37372,"I like to regularly remind people that in the UK, after the first lockdown and 40,000 deaths later, the UK government adopted the ""eat out to help out"" scheme, in which the government paid for half price on all food eaten in restaurants to encourage people to cram into restaurants."

37378,Do you know how science works?
37379,You’re the one claiming it’s seasonal.
37380,It’s on you to prove it.
37381,Also that article is from April.
37382,Isn't the Scum owned by the owner of Fox News?
37383,There is a mountain of published research about how it’s impossible to learn while being traumatized.
37384,"We are wired for safety and when it is nowhere to be found, we massively regress to our most basic instincts."
37385,"College was hard enough when I did it in the mid ‘00s which, in retrospect, was such an easy time to be alive."
37386,No one will remember what they learned this year.
37387,"All they’ll remember is how hard it was, and how pointless it was to suffer like that."
37388,Sarcasm?
37389,TL;DR.
37390,The Swedish public health agency (FHM) has implemented 50% of the face mask recommendations from the WHO.
37391,There actually exists a recommendation for face masks that FHM started working  on when the WHO came out with their updated recommendations.
37392,"It can be found here:
https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/contentassets/eb0d34a63a124fa39c7c2d5753dedaa4/atgarder-minska-risken-smittspridning-covid-19-personal-vard-tandvard-omsorg.pdf

However it only covers close interactions between caregivers and patients like for instance at a dentist’s office."
37393,This is the kind of situation where they believe face masks will be effective in reducing transmission.
37394,"&gt;	Mouthguards and visors can act as a mechanical barrier that reduces the risk of the wearer spreading secretions from the mouth and nose when they speak, cough or sneeze."
37395,This is usually called source control (Swedish expression is missing).
37396,"The basic measure is that staff with symptoms, even mild ones, should stay at home."
37397,"Although physical distancing works in society at large, it is not as easy to maintain between staff and patients and caregivers in all situations."
37398,The purpose of source control in this context is to try to reduce the risk of asymptomatic staff spreading covid-19 to patients and caregivers when working face-to-face.
37399,"Here, the duration of the work close to the face is also important for the risk of infection transmission."
37400,"The measure probably also means some protection for those who wear a mouth guard or visor, even if protection for the eyes, nose and mouth is to be used at the same time when caring for confirmed covid-19 cases."
37401,This covers the first part of the [WHO recommendation](https://apps.who.int/iris/rest/bitstreams/1279750/retrieve).
37402,The second part is what people usually mean with face mask recommendations; use by the general public.
37403,"They preface their recommendation with this:

&gt;	Many countries have recommended the use of fabric masks/face coverings for the general public."
37404,"At the present time, the widespread use of masks by healthy people in the community setting is not yet supported by high quality or direct scientific evidence and there are potential benefits and harms to consider."
37405,The FHM is instead pushing for social distancing measures that proved perfectly capable of stopping the spread this spring.
37406,Wether or not that will work this time remains to be seen.
37407,&gt;Why would they do that?
37408,"The same reason they now deny the strategy was based on herd immunity, when it is well documented that even Tegnell himself said it was back in March."
37409,"I think we’re from the same country, so I wholeheartedly agree."
37410,"Because of the pandemic I’ve lost my job back in July, been at a new job for a while now and I am again the only person wearing a mask."
37411,Responsible adults my ass lol
37412,I bet next year we see a huge increase in cancer deaths.
37413,"People are skipping screenings, or having appointments pushed back."
37414,"I personally have seen it with a coworker who kept getting a mammogram pushed back 6 months, and it turned out she had cancer in both breasts."
37415,Cousin had a weird black mole on his back that he couldn't get a derm appointment for in March.
37416,Finally got surgery for melanoma last month.
37417,These are not uncommon stories.
37418,So damn frustrating to see people arguing about literal covid deaths when there's so much more misery beyond that.
37419,The US was also hit by 10 hurricanes this year and I feel like everyone forgot about those too.
37420,"It was the worst hurricane season on record, beginning two weeks early and running well into the Greek letters."
37421,And there's technically a week left.
37422,You tried :)
37423,The thing that pisses me off most is I’ve been busting my ass to avoid being part of the problem.
37424,"Aside from my asthmatic son, most of the other people I’ve been concerned about (older/overweight friends and relatives) don’t care at all and are doing very little to protect themselves."
37425,"I just keep telling myself, “I’m doing it for my son” because right about now that’s the only thing preventing me from saying “f@ck all these people if they don’t care then I will stop inconveniencing myself to protect them.” 

I’m very healthy and have very little concern about catching this myself other than the fact that I might give to my son."
37426,Once he’s vaccinated everyone else can f@ck right off.
37427,I ended two relationships with family members.
37428,"I wonder if the more mass you have, the more virus exposure is needed to cause an infection, but your ability to fight off the infection varies based on your physical health."
37429,Would a very tall person who is extremely physically healthy be less likely to catch a virus than a short person who is also physically healthy?
37430,It doesn't matter so much that the disease is new when you assess damage to the body's organs.
37431,"Humans have been studying physiology a long time and can assess pathologies of the heart, lungs , kidneys and other organs and know wether they will be permanent or not irregardless of if the cause is new."
37432,It'll sweep through and eventually reach a saturation point.
37433,[removed]
37434,"No, some independent group, but with a decidedly national, unified orientation, ""command"" and message."
37435,Make it very WWII in reference.
37436,How dare you mention that!!
37437,!
37438,"Even if you weren't a troll, I dont think you know how society works."
37439,"Ugh, that is truly disheartening."
37440,"If even other medical personnel won't take it  seriously, I'm not sure what to say anymore."
37441,I hope you're doing a little better now that you're out of that environment.
37442,DM me if you ever need to rant.
37443,"I know most of us could use a friendly ear, at the very least."
37444,Agree.
37445,HIV has a high probability to turn into a death sentence yet people still go bare with strangers.
37446,"Same mindset, these people just don’t care."
37447,Caring is too much of an inconvenience for them.
37448,"It's not an ace2 inhibitor, the antibodies target the virus."
37449,It is possible.
37450,Are we seeing similarly unequal distribution?
37451,Spring was mostly New York.
37452,Summer was much more evenly distributed between major metropolitan centers.
37453,"What is troublesome that people are too eager to sum up the numbers instead of dividing them up, both by population and geography."
37454,"Nah, it's true."
37455,Sweden's results are terrible because they chose and stuck to a terrible strategy.
37456,"And yes, it does sting to actually see how many deaths would have been prevented if they'd done as competently as their neighbors."
37457,I think that's a fairly polite way of putting it..
37458,"Yeah, well, I'm guessing it doesn't survive being cooked."
37459,"And you should be washing your hands after touching raw chicken, fish or pork."
37460,Yes...
37461,I was just adding evidence that Tegnell himself also agreed that herd immunity was the strategy.
37462,&gt; misleading attempt to rewrite history.
37463,Yes.
37464,"I see it as like that line from Orwell's *1984:*

37476,This person is just correcting the record.
37477,This is about how they filtered who got the money.
37478,Not everyone got $1200 and the $1200 was not limited to only people who were impacted by the virus.
37479,In the US they chose to give it to the unemployed assuming that would hit the most that are impacted.
37480,It might not work as well but acting like the $1200-$2400/mo extra that is being given out is nothing is disingenuous.

37483,"Overall, 177 COVID-19 cases were linked to the event, including seven hospitalizations and seven deaths (four in hospitalized persons)."
37484,Investigation revealed noncompliance with CDC’s recommended mitigation measures.
37485,What are the implications for public health practice?
37486,"To mitigate transmission, persons should avoid large gatherings, practice physical distancing, wear masks, stay home when ill, and self-quarantine after exposure to a person with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.

37496,I don't see a way that everyone doesn't get it now that people are all over the place traveling.
37497,I don't think masks are the same situation at all.
37498,Seatbelts primarily protect the wearer.
37499,"Masks also, probably primarily, protect other people."
37500,"The consequences of not using a seatbelt are mainly born by the person who decided not to use one; often enough, the consequences won't even include taking up a place in the hospital, just in the morgue."
37501,The consequences of a person not wearing a mask are arguably mainly born by others.
37502,I don't see anything wrong with leaving something up to an individual's choice if it's the individual who bears the risk.
37503,That changes fundamentally if it's not the individual who bears the risk.

37568,"I almost had to beg my parents to cancel their trip to Puerto Rico on December 26th, I even got my mom to cancel a Thanksgiving dinner (I believe she only invited my brother and sister, but still, absolutely not) and I'm opening her up to the idea of cancelling Christmas (I think it was my brothers and sisters, but of course, absolutely fucking not) and she's saying stuff like ""oh well come on it's Christmas!"
37569,"They can just eat in the back porch blah blah blah"" but I'm going to get her to cancel it, I just need to work on it slowly."
37570,"I just want to say my parents are extremely careful and take every precaution necessary, never going out unless it's for necessities and when they do go out it's with masks/gloves/sanitizer/the works."
37571,"I honestly think they've just had enough and figured just one time for the holidays with a couple family members would be okay, but why take the risk?"
37572,When a vaccine is so close on top of it?
37573,"It genuinely feels like a full time job taking care of my family and keeping them informed, idk what would happen if I weren't here."
37574,"My brothers and sisters clearly didn't find a problem with coming over for the holidays, what the hell would have happened if I hadn't moved back in with them this year?"
37575,I guess that's my glass-half-full way of looking at moving back in.

37618,Stepbrother and brother in law are now a cop and firefighter respectively.
37619,A lot of EMTs do go into those two fields or nursing.
37620,It’s quite dumb to think just because a vaccine was made quickly so it carries more risk.
37621,"It does not take time to make a vaccine, it takes resources."
37622,And the government has put a LOT of resources on this one thing.
37623,It’s no more dangerous than any other vaccine and will have gone through the same testing and validation by the time it’s available.

37735,Going to public restrooms?
37736,"Those are highly contagious locations, residuals shared bathrooms."
37737,What if he gets into an accident?
37738,More people on the road = more accidents.

37740,"If the car needs to get towed, he will be riding with a stranger."
37741,"If he gets injured, he will be in a hospital, with a ton of potential exposure."
37742,Testing is not 100%.
37743,You can be infected but have too low of a viral load when testing to show up as positive.
37744,This is why many countries require testing and a 2 week quarantine.
37745,I guarantee that people are not doing that.
37746,Quarantine: most people are not actually quarantining.
37747,They're still going to grocery stores/parks/pharmacies.

37821,That's what I'm thinking.
37822,By then we'll have vaccines and a president who will actually take action to combat the virus.
37823,Which ultimately means they export the issue.
37824,Hospitals in northwest Arkansas (for example) are taking a lot of COVID patients from SW Missouri and NE Oklahoma - states without mask orders.
37825,"This isn't a condemnation of those hospitals - if the roles were reversed and Arkansas had no mask orders, we'd be exporting to OK and MO."

37883,I'm assuming linear because well I'd rather not think of an exponential curve after thanksgiving.

37892,I’m fighting off COVID right now and am the perfect example of masks do work.
37893,"I wore a mask while symptomatic (I thought it was a sinus infection) at work, and all of my co-workers that have received their results so far are negative."
37894,My grandma who I wore a mask around is also negative.
37895,"Meanwhile me, my mom, and stepdad were all positive because we live together and didn’t have on masks."
37896,It drives me INSANE for people to be like masks don’t work when they do.

37903,What are good sources to find out further information about how countries in Africa are handling the pandemic?
37904,I hate the response in this country and am tired of being in tears whenever the CBS Nightly News music starts and have to hear about breaking numbers and how nothing is changing because of how fucking dumb these people are.
37905,I would love to hear more about Rwanda and other countries managing the pandemic.
37906,"Honestly, it would give me some hope."

37911,No but there are people who will start screaming at the TV the moment Trump opens his mouth.
37912,It’s at the point where he’s automatically wrong.
37913,So I think there will be people who are deterred simply because he thinks the vaccine should work/be taken.
37914,"For example, he also said HCQ should be taken and that Remdesivir are miracle cures so I guarantee people will say “yeah, if Trump is touting a vaccine, no way in hell I’m taking it.”"
37915,Well all 3 airports were no where near packed and everyone had masks.
37916,You seem to be part of problem if you are able to take pictures like that.

37947,I have never met anyone that had trouble showing others empathy that wasn't a complete psycho.
37948,I really do believe that there are more sociopaths out there than we realize.
37949,Sure not everyone is Ted Bundy.
37950,"But I know many, many people that have no problem treating someone that they view as ""beneath them"" horribly."
37951,This is one of those glitch in the Matrix moments.
37952,"I am reading Jim Carrey's memoir and got done reading a paragraph about the great leap forward and then Googled it and thought...hmm, should read more about that."
37953,This was moments ago.
37954,"Finished the chapter, get on Reddit, first thing I read is about the great leap forward."
37955,Weird.
37956,Actually my position is that you don’t shut down anything.
37957,Let people assess their risk and make decisions individually.
37958,The lockdowns will never work in this country.
37959,Enough people will disobey to the point where it is going to continue to spread.
37960,So there is no point in trying when even trying destroys the economy.
37961,"Im safe over here in aus, the worlds gone to shit."
37962,I dont think many countries have done well outside SK and NZ
37963,You need to do better at organizing your thoughts.
37964,Your first statement makes no sense.
37965,"The first part of the second statement is objective truth, hospitals were coding covid deaths to turn profits, there's nothing to argue there that's facts."
37966,"No idea what ""straight dope"" means."
37967,"I'm mad because this fear mongering subreddit has run rampant with misinformation and it's a blight to the realities of this pandemic, just as bad as the far right, if not worse."

38005,Guy licks fingers.
38006,Guy touches something.

38014,"That’s not defined by decorative degrees, it’s defined by your scientific understanding and achievement."

38035,It's hard to tell what travel will ultimately look like with the new flexible bookings.
38036,Plenty of people like me who may have booked a flight a while back hoping things would look good but ultimately going to cancel.
38037,I'm going to take that trip EVENTUALLY so it's not the end of the world to end up with a voucher (although hopefully the airline can honor it later)
38038,I've heard that some people with insurance will lie and tell the testing site they don't have insurance to avoid the paperwork.
38039,"Yeah, especially once the hospitals get overwhelmed everywhere."
38040,":( 

My family's pared down our Thanksgiving to just my mom delivering food to one of her sisters and then making Thanksgiving dinner for just us living with her, and we'll probably do something similar for Christmas as well."
38041,"Hopefully that pays off for us, because in my mom's side of the family who we usually see for the holidays there's not only many old people with pre-existing conditions who will be priority for the vaccine, but also one of my mom's good friends is a physical therapist at a nursing home who might actually be higher priority for the vaccine than my elderly relatives."
38042,A bunch of robbers came in through that open door and stole everything we had.
38043,Let's lock the door now!
38044,This is my favorite holiday.
38045,"There's no stupid presents to buy, no cards needed, showing off cooking skills and vegging around the house with friends and family and watch some football."

38047,This year sucks!
38048,"But we've all gotta make sacrifices, and this is a huge one for me."
38049,Good on you!
38050,I mean honestly I can understand the complications.
38051,Even pro vaccine people want a tested safety record and proven results.
38052,"Imagine consenting to your child having an experimental vaccine tested on them, even knowing it has to pass multiple rounds of review before it gets to that point."
38053,Probably difficult to find people willing to do that.
38054,[deleted]
38055,I highly doubt this to be accurate but I realize it will be highly upvoted to reinforce the America sucks narrative.
38056,"Yeah I did know about the evidence that the Spanish flu may have come from the US, but I still think China should get a lot of the blame for COVID as well."
38057,"That was my thought exactly, who are you going to believe Dr Fauci and his staff or Nurse Betty?"
38058,"I appreciate the job they are doing, but they are not the experts in this."
38059,It's this line of reasoning that leads to neuroradiologists and pharma lobbyists having way to much say in the handling of Covid.
38060,"In the words of Kevin Hart, ""Stay in your lane""."
38061,I'm going to trust Fauci over [Dr. Stella Immanuel](https://www.vice.com/en/article/5dpzna/doctor-who-warned-of-demon-sex-and-touts-covid-conspiracies-is-now-campaigning-for-trump)
38062,"I used to have 0 dollars, and now have -200,000 (ish)..."
38063,"The thing is, when I had $0, the $1000 I had to somehow come up with every month to have a place to live was being used to pay for someone else's house (their *commercial property* actually)."
38064,"So for 25 years, I bought someone else's shit for them."
38065,"With -200,000, the $1,000 I pay every month is paying for my own shit."
38066,"The poor staying poor isn't because wages, jobs, blah blah blah..."
38067,"It's because their biggest expense is footing the bill for someone who isn't poor...

And to add insult to injury, the only way to overcome that first big ass hurdle and stop spending most of your pay on someone else's shit, is to have good credit, and you get good credit by making your negative number bigger...  Get a bunch of credit cards, finance a car, take out a loan or three and start paying out some interest, and your score goes up..."
38068,It's literally a measure of how profitable you are as an interest producing chump.
38069,"That's the ""cost of entry"" or the ante up at the poker table, so that -200,000 number isn't a sign of having *less*, it's a sign that you actually got a seat at the fucking table and have a chance at getting in the black"
38070,"Yeah, my company took it away, 'cause there's no threat anymore, it seems."
38071,"Meanwhile, our store hasn't gone more than two weeks without someone having to quarantine or actually getting the virus since September."
38072,But our store manager is beyond thrilled that we actually hit our state-mandated capacity limit today.
38073,"...Conclusion

Vitamin D deficiency markedly increases the chance of having severe disease after infection with SARS Cov-2."
38074,The intensity of inflammatory response is also higher in vitamin D deficient COVID-19 patients.
38075,This all translates to increase morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients who are deficient in vitamin D. Keeping the current COVID-19 pandemic in view authors recommend administration of vitamin D supplements to population at risk for COVID-19.
38076,OR THEY ALREADY HAD THE VIRUS AND CAME OUT TO BE POSITIVE WITHIN THE 14 DAY PERIOD LOL
38077,"I mean geographically yes, as well as in terms of social and cultural influence."
38078,"Both Australia and NZ have large Asian populations and I'm so glad that both countries handled the pandemic like an Asian country would, rather than America or Europe"

38082,Ah the ICU nurse superiority complex.

38086,Then put a wall around France and let the rational world move on with their life.
38087,...no?
38088,Bill Gates is not a scientist.
38089,And are you suggesting Fauci is a worse resource than Gates?

38093,"Yeah, they also both frequented wallstreetbets and seemed to have the same agenda."
38094,"It's like somebody putting on glasses and being like ""YoU caN't rEcogNize mE nao"""

38096,Just like oz and nz.
38097,i hope you feel better soon!!
38098,!
38099,Source on people getting it a second time?
38100,I think it was Nikolas Cristakos on Joe Rogan the other day that said there's a strong case for giving the vaccine to working age adults before the elderly because they're the ones out and about most and actually spreading the disease.
38101,This may result in less overall deaths in the elderly population as a result.
38102,There must be some model they can run to figure out the best rollout strategy given all we know about the virus and how it's spreading now...
38103,It was a Boing 777.
38104,It seats 396 people.
38105,304 people were aboard.
38106,Most airlines are not flying their routes at 25%.
38107,Especially not the 18 hour ones.
38108,"They left 25 seats intentionally empty on our Airbus 321 today, and it normally seats 200."
38109,I’m under voluntary quarantine right now.
38110,"I’m not required to be, it’s just the responsible thing to do."
38111,What makes a man turn neutral?
38112,Lust for gold?
38113,Power?
38114,Or were you just born with a heart full of neutrality?
38115,The numbers are still very low compared to euro countries no?
38116,"Maybe, we don’t even know if adults will get a decent one."
38117,Appears positive but patience on results
38118,I'm so sorry.
38119,Wishing you strength - I can't imagine how isolated and powerless you must feel.
38120,"&gt; I hear the alarm bells, why doesn't the government?"
38121,"See they do, but they're drowned out by the cha-ching of \~~profits

38122,It’s not that haven’t caught on.
38123,It’s that it’s not important enough to them.
38124,"Even in China people can discuss things, sometimes even post things."
38125,But if an activist starts doing it and gains some transaction the hammer will come.
38126,That’s free speech.
38127,Not the ability of little people to have idle chit chat.
38128,I can’t tell if you are really just a koolaid drinker or something more serious.
38129,I’ve never met one Singaporean person who would ever try to tell me they have true free speech or free press.
38130,Not one.
38131,They may not care since life is good but they are realistic about the truth.
38132,You really think it’s ok for the police to require you to have a permit to hold a virtual meeting?
38133,This is a normal requirement that everyone else has to do?
38134,Come on.
38135,"You aren’t credible at all

38137,"Your heart was in the right place to be helping people, but the compensation for that could never be enough."
38138,"What you said makes me think about my dad, who is a volunteer for the local FD back home."
38139,"Its a very small town and not much happens there, but because he used to work for the town for many years (their garage was located directly behind the FD, sharing a parking lot even) he was often a first responder to many emergency calls if he didn't by chance happen to already be in the area."
38140,"In such a small town, he was always pretty much ""in the area""."
38141,"One day, on a Sunday, he happened to be at the local gas station in the center of town when a car parked in the parking lot suddenly shot backwards into the street."
38142,"There was a sharp drop and a wooden fence between the parking lot and the road, so this VW bug completely flipped over and slid across the street, smearing the drivers head along with it... he, and another local EMT who was in the store as well were the unfortunate first responders on that call that afternoon."
38143,I know that it wasn't the first time he had seen the inside of someone's skull or bones sticking out of someone's body.
38144,I just... idk.
38145,I can't even watch people fall too hard or get hurt because the thought of them breaking bones is just too much for me.
38146,"How he could walk away from incidents like that and continue to do it as a volunteer for so many years, is something I would never, ever, be able to do myself."
38147,I'm honestly not sure how much you'd have to pay me to do something like that.

38177,And there are many reasons to be optimistic about us being closer to normality by spring 2021.
38178,"I'm gonna go with the scientists, too."
38179,Bill Gates isn't a scientist.
38180,There's credible evidence that the Spanish Flu from a hundred years ago did originate in the US.
38181,But the focus wasn't on where it originated but what do we do with it now?
38182,Most governments knew something was pretty serious in January.
38183,Most governments reacted.
38184,Amazingly the one government that didn't was the one that was the most prepared.
38185,But Trump dismantled much of that preparedness during the first three years of his presidency and then squandered months downplaying and denying the seriousness losing precious time to respond.
38186,Trump will have the deaths of at least half a million Americans on his hands during the last year of his presdency.

38192,Yes.

38194,They saw 17 cases in one day and announced a week-long lockdown.
38195,Things were better than they originally thought and they were able to start lifting restrictions after only three days.

38226,No its not.
38227,Its logical.
38228,Of course it carries more risk (meaning potential for unknown consequence not *danger*)  than vaccines which have been tested over longer periods of time.
38229,"It will in no way whatsoever have gone through the same testing and validation (sic) as ""any other vaccine"" when it comes to market."
38230,All that comes with the territory of the pandemic and IMO people are much more likely to choose to take it if they are treated like adults able to understand the above and given an accompanying explanation of the cost/benefit and risk/reward.
38231,"I will 100% be taking one of them when it's available to me though if the non-MRNA Oxford vaccine is comparably effective and available at the same time, I'll choose that over the other two."
38232,"He explained something and u said ""cute eli5 there lol"" that started it"
38233,Thanks for the detailed explanation.
38234,The reason I asked was because it was evident even from the aggregated data that the counties with and without mandates were somehow different.
38235,"I did not know how, but it should be taken into account that whatever caused the difference in the initial situation could have also affected the outcome _after_ masks were mandated."
38236,Your answer confirms my intuitive suspicion.
38237,"The west has actually spent more cash fighting Covid than the east, just to less avail"
38238,"I understand, and to a degree, agree with the sentiment."
38239,"But at the same time, I can’t pay my bills with warm fuzzy feelings."
38240,"I’ll never forget being able to help people through a scary and dangerous time, but preying on the hearts of people who have passion for their work as if that’s justification for paying them like shit is reprehensible itself."
38241,The whole system is fucked.
38242,"The people driving the ambulance and providing care are being paid like shit, while the ambulance company and insurance charges thousands of dollars to the patient for the “privilege” of getting life saving care."
38243,"All so corporate CEOs and their middle men can make a little more money and appease their shareholders, everyone else down the chain be damned."
38244,"South Australia had an outbreak recently of 20 people, resulting from hotel quarantine."
38245,They went into hard lockdown for 6 days but came out early due to low case numbers and incorrect evidence the virus was transmitting to casual contacts.
38246,They had zero new cases today.
38247,Outside of South Australia there have been no cases of community transmission (i.e.
38248,"only international travellers have tested positive) for 2 weeks

38268,"Hey, no real skin in the game here, but did want to pop by to let you know that your string of comments here is literally one of the stupidest things I've read all 2020."
38269,"It actually reads like something from ""Ken M""."
38270,"It definitely has that South Park or Futurama feel of multiple unrelated, nonsensical plot threads coming together at the end for a really convoluted punch line."
38271,"You really drank the koolaid there, why don't you go to China and see how good people have it there before you speak."
38272,Oh wait you can't because your government can't contain covid like China can.
38273,This one’s a tough one!
38274,"The biggest risk I see in this situation is that one of you may still be infectious, even though you’re all feeling better;  in some cases, people have tested positive weeks or months after they had seemed to recover."
38275,"Presumably, your physician thought of this when clearing you to return to work, though."
38276,I think the risk to your family is indeed quite low - reinfections are certainly possible but really rare (and we are hoping this is true because we very much want the vaccines to be effective!)
38277,But the risk to them is really hard to measure.
38278,"If they all live together and came directly to your home, packing a lunch and only stopping for gas and bathroom while masked up and extra cautious, the marginal extra risk to them from your area being on fire is probably not a huge issue - just the risk to them from someone in your family still being infectious."
38279,"If they are coming from separate households I’d be much, much more concerned."
38280,"Testing 3 days prior still leaves plenty of room for uncertainty or late breaking infections, so the four of them could also be at risk for spreading amongst themselves."
38281,"If they don’t all live under one roof, DEFINITELY call it off."
38282,"Nobody can tell you this gathering is safe, but you’re effectively in a situation where four vaccinated people are meeting four unvaccinated ones who live together, which is a little less insane than eight people who are all from separate households gathering."
38283,Most of the risk is from lingering infection in your family and from the road trip.
38284,Would I do it?
38285,"No, I’d probably call it off and Zoom - there’s definitely still risk."
38286,But is it negligent levels of risk?
38287,"If all four of them are young folks under 50 from a single household, no comorbidities, they commit to quarantining for 10 days after returning home, and everyone is cautious during the visit - I’ve certainly heard far crazier plans."
38288,"In that case, it looks much more like forming a “pod” to me from a risk perspective."

38300,How do HR departments not understand that it takes on average three to five days after exposure for the viral load to be high enough to be detected by a standard PCR swab test?
38301,This has been known since May by all of the scientists who have been paying attention.
38302,"Honestly, it’s irresponsible for any company to be selling Covid testing kits without making sure that whoever is doing the testing understands what timing and isolation procedures they should use to get the most accurate results."
38303,as a canadian the concept that your law enforcement people are elected and aligned with a party is BATSHIT CRAZY
38304,Kentucky.
38305,Gov Bashear has been fairly strict from the early get-go.
38306,Earlier than most other states.
38307,They put limits on the amount of people per household that can enter a store.
38308,Our Kroger and Target both had signs limiting to one per household.
38309,Super happy with Gov's decision on that one.
38310,"And if it's not high risk to be outside around hundreds of people, also super thankful he told us we couldn't have BBQs during 4th of July with families because it was too much risk of spread...He was shaming people who were being called out for having gatherings in their front lawn with social distancing hanging out in lawn chairs."

38332,In every thread there is a post like this where someone says that the effects of the virus are worse than the possible effects of the vaccine.
38333,"The problem there is they are always talking as if getting the virus or the vaccine are the only two options, that if you don't get the vaccine that you WILL get the virus."
38334,People are currently taking steps in order to not get sick.
38335,"I work from home, I have groceries placed in my trunk upon pickup from the store, I haven't touched anyone or gone in anyone's home since March."
38336,I can wait on the vaccine a while as others get it first and continue doing what I have been a bit longer and have basically a 0% risk for myself and others.

38381,If you look at total deaths per 100k blue team seems to be ahead quite a bit (being 8 of the top 10 states).

38457,But from my understanding (as a researcher and now med student) comorbidity is a condition (or more than one condition) that you have that is not part of what you are examining.

38485,This is probably the first year I’m *not* lying to get out of holidays.
38486,Technically covid is *one* reason I don’t want to go.
38487,Gloooom and dooooom!
38488,at least some states literally came up with a new branch of medicaid to cover the cost of tests for anyone who doesn't have insurance.
38489,and they were doing free drive through testing for anyone who signed up anyways
38490,I accept your pity....and food....
38491,Yup!
38492,Agree.
38493,That’s why I cycle instead of getting mad at everyone else who chooses to car commute.
38494,Not specifically on holidays though.
38495,"Some of them sure, but many who are given shifts on the holiday and can't eat with their family."
38496,"They either miss out"" or, schedule for later."
38497,Which is what the average citizen can do this year.
38498,Schedule summer holidays after vaccinations.
38499,Or when cases dip again.
38500,Just like someone deployed over a holiday may celebrate at a later time.
38501,Even with federal leadership Americans don’t listen.
38502,That’s the cost of freedom.

38509,masks help.
38510,"there is a mask mandate in Springfield MO city limits and has been for some time, interestingly, hospitals here are saying  (link below) about 75% of COVID cases in springfield mo hospitals are people living OUTSIDE the city limits, where there are no mask mandates."

38512,Pfizer had announced that the two doses would cost $39 US dollars.
38513,Not sure if that price holds constant throughout the world.
38514,I am sure it makes a difference.
38515,Here in Canada we also eat most of the same crap the US does.
38516,We have obesity issues though not as severe as the US.
38517,But the major difference of course is that we have nationalized health care.

38519,Based on previous pandemics all the data pointed to the fact that there would be a second surge.
38520,We all knew it would happen.
38521,Many of us didn’t believe it.
38522,"The problem is if you do well in the first wave, everyone thinks it was a hoax or not that serious and they drop their guard leading to a second wave."
38523,"Conversely, if you do badly and mismanage the first wave, you just have a ginormous second wave because nothing was ever under control to begin with."
38524,Not all regions are going to react one way or the other.
38525,So the areas that mismanage the pandemic are going to make it even harder on the ones that have it under control.
38526,We are getting to see in real time how pandemics get out of control.
38527,"Oh wow, many humans are entitled reckless assholes."
38528,Tell us something new.
38529,This was totally predictable.
38530,Oh no I can't believe people traveling I'm sorry :-(
38531,"So this was in the article - 

A vaccine, he said, keeps you from getting the disease and the symptoms, not from getting the virus."
38532,"You might not feel ill or show any symptoms, and that means the vaccine is successful, but it doesn’t mean you can’t have the virus and thus spread it to others."
38533,So even if you are vaccinated you can still contract the virus and spread it to others.

38575,One of our local hospitals is raising insurance costs and cutting retirement contributions January 1.
38576,"The nurses are thinking about striking, and the hospital is basically like you can’t strike, COVID cases are counting on you."
38577,"Basically, not only do people not care about the virus, the hospitals are using it to actively screw with people’s benefits while they are literally risking their lives during a pandemic."
38578,It’s pathetic.
38579,Who said anything about a virus?
38580,I specifically said the lockdown laws that have been put in place that require people to stay at home.
38581,"I think the post-Thanks Giving surge will briefly spike to 450k cases a day for about a week, then go back down only to continue the slow rise again."
38582,I don't disagree with your quarantine nor your stoicism.
38583,"However, you do realize it is incorrect to say you can do nothing about other people."
38584,"Humans are social animals and our lives are influenced, and in a large degree controlled, by other humans."
38585,"&gt;So if you get infected today, don't assume there will be a doctor/nurse available to care for you should you require that level of care."
38586,This.
38587,The hospital I work at is already at capacity and is having an issue with keeping workers.
38588,"(Stress from the whole deal, catching the covid and being out, low pay... a variety of reasons why.)"
38589,"When this Thanksgiving wave hits, it's going to be awful."
38590,"I mean, that's been said about everything, the protests, elections, other holidays, but I think this and Christmas will be the worst ones."
38591,"Especially with so many people saying this is probably nana's last thanksgiving, of course we will all get together."
38592,"Obviously in many of those, they have no idea how long nana has left to live, but they pretty well just guaranteed her dead by Christmas."
38593,"But hospitals will not have enough rooms, staff, or equipment to deal with what will most likely be a huge increase in daily cases needing to be seen."

39234,"It was nice knowing you, lads"
39235,"I believe there's also concern that the way some people talk and breathe, or possibly the structure of their throat, affects the extent to which they spread the virus."
39236,"Essentially, two people may do exactly the same things, but one doesn't spread the virus at all and the other spreads it like measles, because the latter sheds more particles than the virus."

39244,Then people started getting sick......including me.
39245,I found out the day after this meeting that I had been exposed at work.
39246,We had 20-30 people at least get sick and one of them died.
39247,I might have exposed every single person in our congregation and I might be the reason a good friend of mine is a widower right now.

39266,"I guarantee I can get a lot of people to say ""Yes"" when I ask ""Can I pay you in gold?"""
39267,Both of those items have a face value as well.
39268,"Just like the value of a dollar changes from day to day, so does gold and soybeans."
39269,"If you look at it from this perspective, all currencies are commodities and are bought and sold as such."
39270,It's the acceptance of a commodity as payment that makes it a currency.
39271,"Bitcoin, for example."
39272,"It's as intrinsically worthless a commodity as sand, except for the value people place upon it for its scarcity."
39273,Like gold.
39274,Queueing theory engineer here.
39275,This is the way.
39276,Data from March (when we were using the extremely limited number of known-defective cdc tests) isn't really directly comparable to data from September.
39277,Just two things to consider.
39278,- the percent positive rate was astronomically higher.
39279,"NY, NJ, CA probably had FAR more cases than are reflected in the public data, starting in like Feb."
39280,"True total infection counts are probably drastically skewed to the high population coastal states, much more than this data shows."
39281,- treatment for covid19 was still being figured out when NYC was getting walloped.
39282,"The people who did make it to the hospital were much more likely to die then than they are today, sometimes over simple things like being laid on their stomach instead of back."
39283,Imo this kind of presentation of the data is not beneficial to public health.
39284,"People immediately want to manipulate it for scoring points for ""their team"": the person who originally created the website clearly has an agenda."

39289,"&gt; ""For a 99.6% survival rate, we are destroying the economy and destroying  peoples lives and all of the things that go along with it,"" Hayhoe  said."
39290,*  3% of all covid cases currently result in death.
39291,"This number will go up as our healthcare system is at the maximum capacity and our doctors and nurses are wore out, getting sick, or just quitting."
39292,* It is not known how many cases go undetected so we don't know the true death rate.
39293,"Even the WHO , being very optimistic with believing random sample studies, think the mortality is around 0.6%."
39294,"* The amount of asymptomatic cases, regardless of the percent( though 50% is generally assumed) , should be alarming in its own right."
39295,These people can spread covid for days  without even knowing it.
39296,"* In the 2018-2019 flu season the CDC estimates that 34,200 people succumb to the flu."
39297,"262,000 Americans have died of Covid this year and its not over yet."
39298,If you figure deaths to deaths Covid will kill about 10x more people  this year than the flu did in 2018-2018 flu season.
39299,BUT Covid will do it with about half as many confirmed infections.
39300,"Before someone says ""but covid can be asymptomatic!"
39301,""", it is estimated that 50% of flu carriers are asymptomatic which is where they get the 50% asymptomatic assumption for covid."
39302,"Lastly, Covid has to invade our population and spread whereas flu has already been here and established."
39303,It took nearly the first half the year to reach a majority of America.
39304,So  about 10x more people die of Covid than the flu and the flu was established whereas covid took months to fully spread to all of the same area covered by the flu statistic.
39305,There were also no measures to slow the spread of flu.
39306,No distancing or mask wearing.
39307,Only a vaccine which doesn't stop you from getting it or becoming a carrier.
39308,We can logically assume from all this that the logical mortality rate of Covid given that it is well rooted in a  population is at least 10x the mortality rate of flu and would likely be 20x if it had already been established in our population.
39309,"Without partial mitigation measures that were put in place, the mortality rate would mostly likely increase to 30-40x of the flu."
39310,This would have been due to more infections of the more deadly strains of the virus.
39311,As of August there were six strains of the virus.
39312,The more deadly strains die out if they kill the host before they can spread.
39313,So the virus evolves to not kill the host so it can also survive and spread.
39314,Mitigation measures have helped cause the virus  to evolve into less deadly and harder to detect( more mild) forms.
39315,Best case scenario we can figure a 1% mortality rate based on a flu comparison.
39316,"But in reality this virus has about 2 to 4% mortality rate which is the observed mortality rate( 3%)

* Finally 10% of Covid positive cases develop ""Long Covid"", lingering symptoms  and even organ damage."
39317,"Some of these resolve months after the initial infection leaves the body, some are permanent scars of the disease."
39318,Covid is the # 3 kill of people in the US right now.
39319,"The flu is  at the bottom the top list, if it makes it on the list."
39320,Covid and flu are the only infectious diseases on the list.
39321,"The only diseases you can ""catch"" from others."
39322,That makes their mortality rates even more serious  as these diseases can spread through a population like a wildfire infecting and reinfecting...unlike the top two killers: heart disease and cancer.
39323,There will be thousands of deaths this year because some people HAD to go to Sturgis.
39324,Don't be that guy.
39325,Don't be  the person that kills people out of your own willful ignorance and greed.
39326,"Businesses can be rebuilt, people can't."
39327,"And you might be like "" Well people die every day"" until it's your mother, brother, or daughter you have to say goodbye too because someone gave them covid."
39328,Their death could have been prevented with a little more caring about other people and a little less selfish greed.
39329,"Do the right thing and take this virus seriously, because it might just be you in a month laying in ICU( if your lucky enough to find an open bed), with a breathing tube shoved down your throat feeling like death could come for you any moment."
39330,Then you wont feel so callous with that little mortality rate.
39331,What state?
39332,Good!
39333,Take all of them out of the gene pool.
39334,Help us make a better tomorrow.
39335,"Also, it could be mandatory by law."
39336,Don't forget that business can put it as a business expense.
39337,Best way to do that is to eliminate the demand for the product.
39338,Fastest way to do that is legislation but that's just going to create a black market.
39339,The most sustainable way to do it is to have a cultural shift where people don't want to be wearing clothing made out of animal parts.
39340,It's going to be much easier to convince the young people of that than the old people who already own them.
39341,Remember that these kinds of things were extremely in fashion back when today's old people were the young people.
39342,"Once you convince the young people that it's not fashionable, all you have to do is wait for all the old people to die."
39343,"The market will dry up and the suppliers will go out of business, or more likely they'll switch to a different product."
39344,Clearly they meant fall of... Another year!
39345,Yeah...
39346,"You didn’t win, you just didn’t spend."

39371,I'm an EMT my supervisors were basically asking me to be drenched in covid everyday to make a buck.
39372,I drew the line when we got dispatched on a call to a skilled nursing facility as an urgent 911 for respiratory distress.
39373,"Not only is this woman breathing completely normally, her vitals are stable and she's covid positive."
39374,"This nursing home wanted her taken to the ER to be ""evaluated"" I told them we just did that and she does not need to go to the ER."
39375,She wouldn't have needed to gone in a normal circumstance let alone that that she had covid and the staff wanted us to expose a bunch of people in the process of taking her to the ER.
39376,I explained this and that was a huge unnecessary risk for a patient that is not in any need of immediate medical attention.
39377,Then the nursing home explained the real reason they wanted her to go.
39378,They had new protocols in place about performing CPR on covid patients.
39379,The patients family did not have the DNR paperwork in order for this woman and were arguing about it.
39380,The nursing staff was worried this woman would croak on them and it would be a mess with the family (who were a prickly bunch).
39381,"Somewhat understandable I guess, but I'm not in the business of taking people to the hospital because they may or may not in the future need to go."
39382,I explained this again and the staff became upset they said it was out of their control and this was coming from their medical director (physician legally responsible for all the patients there) whos not on site.
39383,"I say call him up, I want to hear him say why this woman who is alert, conscious, and has normal vial signs needs to urgently go to the ER."
39384,"He says he wants her evaluated, I ask what are they going to evaluate that we haven't."
39385,"We know she has covid, that's already been established."
39386,I told him I wasn't willing to expose an ER staff for the sake of a paperwork headache.
39387,"The medical director was pissed but I knew he knew how fucked up it was, I just wanted him to acknowledge it."
39388,My supervisor was then called.
39389,I was reamed for not doing my job and just accepting the call.
39390,"""Cool, I quit."""
39391,I drove back to base and never went back.
39392,I'm so much happier now.

39395,"I had to tell my mom multiple times it's just 1 year, 1 time."

39398,Yes.

39400,We do not always get what we deserve.
39401,"I like nothing better than everyone stays home, wear a mask, keep the bar close."

39411,": You now have more than one ailment)

No, in that it is not specific to obesity, which is how your post seems to read."
39412,"""Related to"" is sort of an awkward term to use in this case."
39413,"Strictly speaking, being obese doesn't relate to having comorbidites, other than by your default state being 1 condition rather than 0 conditions (though being obese tends to cause its own set of problems, which can get that comorbidity count rolling, but let's set that aside for now)."
39414,"But by that reasoning, any sort of illness or condition that takes you off of a perfectly healthy condition is ""related to"" comorbidities, even if the two conditions have nothing at all to do with each other."
39415,"To use a more extreme example, if you have ADHD and catch COVID, you technically have comorbidities (two medical conditions existing simultaneously), even though they have absolutely nothing to do with each other."

39686,No I didnt know you were talking about Pfizer too.
39687,But yeah there's no part of  this where there isn't government involvement.
39688,I think there's reason to call it 'private' and there's also reason to call it 'public'.
39689,"I was calling the manufacture private since it really is just the government in the US holding a bag of money, not directing the labs or manufacturing process at all."
39690,"And I also choose to call the distribution 'private', because Pfizer's people are the ones getting all the trucks and distribution plans ready."
39691,But I'm sure there's some government person rubber stamping it.
39692,But there isn't a 'vaccine czar' somewhere making the decisions -- yet!
39693,"You wrote ""Our health minister is organizing the vaccination centers"", and that's something I've not heard happening in the US, so I'm thinking there's a difference."
39694,But definitely a caveat is that I dont actually know.
39695,I'm just going off of what you said and what I know of the US process so far.
39696,Really though.
39697,We can’t enforce the risk tolerance of the minority on the majority.
39698,"For people in that age range, the threat of deaths of despair are statistically higher."
39699,We can’t ignore that science.
39700,"And I agree with you, my personal cost-benefit analysis wouldn’t put me in that bar, but I am ok with other people feeling differently about it."
39701,"Or over the mouth, I'm sad to say or maybe glad to say I was a loud asshole at Wal-Mart yesterday, to the well over 12 year old with a chin diaper and two others with dick noses."
39702,I wanted to scream..you're the reason we will never get out of this!
39703,"Oh and spoiler alert, all of you saying just miss one thanksgiving.. um you are pollyannas"
39704,Dude I know.
39705,I absolutely could not believe it.
39706,That was around the time I started looking for another job.
39707,They all just heard about the vaccines.....
39708,All you have to do is drive in traffic to know this.
39709,I'm in the USA.
39710,"Back in the April/May time frame, one of my neighbors, someone I've never met before, they live 2-3 streets over, would have their kid draw ""motivational"" pictures, and then they'd walk around the neighborhood stuffing people's mailboxes with them."
39711,"This was a small child, and I understand that having them draw these pictures probably kept the kid entertained while stuck at home, and going for a walk was good exercise."
39712,"But now I, and all my neighbors, were being included in part of their circle of contagion, and they were being included in ours."
39713,Some people are too stupid.
39714,Does anyone have some comments about this article?
39715,It looks like Oregon is misreporting its number of cases.
39716,https://www.kgw.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/oregon-changes-the-way-it-counts-covid-tests-after-kgw-report/283-e883b1dc-3099-47fb-8556-90e94a707ab7
39717,"*it’s going to lead to a very sad Christmas for a lot of people*

Given that the vast majority of people under the age of 60 recovers from COVID after a week or so, it won't be."
39718,"I know, I know, you'll start talking about the 300k dead by then from COVID, but most people would either not be impacted or they'd dismiss it because the person dying from it in their family was extremely old and frail anyway."
39719,My mother is trying to strongarm me into going to Texas from California and is guilt tripping me hard because I haven’t seen her since February.
39720,"They’re taking the precautions but still the numbers are just too damn high and I’m scared because if I hurt my girlfriend or her family out here, I’d never forgive myself."
39721,I’ve thought about driving but honestly I just hope they issue a travel ban to make this easier and out of my control.
39722,I've been defacto alone for years.
39723,It's just so weird to me that people can't suck it up for a year or two when they have dozens of people they can talk to over Zoom/Snapchat/whatever.
39724,More like using mouthwash vs drinking a 12 pack.
39725,Your exposure to a toxic substance is never zero.
39726,This sub is awful.
39727,Just had a baby in July.
39728,God it's so scary.
39729,I keep telling myself we just have to hang on for another 6 months

39731,The military are experts at *logistics* above absolutely everything else.
39732,Anyone who says otherwise is badly misinformed.
39733,"And as someone who briefly worked for a fortune 50 medical supply company, flu vaccine distribution is a mess of capitalism and misaligned incentives."
39734,The flu vaccine definitely should not be a model for distributing the covid vaccines.
39735,Shit is so tough to hear.
39736,All the people who cry about Pre existing conditions and the low death rate.
39737,Like people with pre existing conditions don't deserve to die.
39738,And most of the time these people will live on for many years if the virus doesn't do them in.

39741,"The abuser is always to blame, but the lockdown response to the virus makes it harder for victims to leave, especially if they have lost their job or or have been cut off from family and friends support networks."
39742,Thank you internet stranger.
39743,It's so frustrating when my patients and co workers are all talking about how this is a bunch of bullshit and still going out like everything is normal.
39744,I would get shit from co workers when I was still wearing my mask and shield in the lab when there weren't any patients.
39745,It seems like I was ever the only one that gave a fuck.
39746,"Interesting, it wasn’t brought up in that thread at all."
39747,Please reveal this information from August to November for us commoners.
39748,There is pretty good evidence that even at 200k/day we are catching a small portion of total cases as most are still going undetected.
39749,Last number I saw was we were catching 1/6.
39750,"At 1.2 million plus per day, 12 million confirmed or roughly 70 million actual infections already.. yeah, we could get through most of the population in a year"
39751,Sounds very familiar to: COVID COVID COVID - that’s all he talks about.
39752,"*Tests positive 5 days later*

*shocked pikachu face*"
39753,"If fearmongers truly cared about other people’s safety, they would support lockdowns every flu season, which killed tens of thousands even with a vaccine."
39754,"But they don’t support that, do they?"
39755,"Pretty sure the golden rule can't die, but you can certainly choose to ignore it to society's detriment."
39756,I feel guilty going to see my mom in Texas from Florida of all places.
39757,"But I haven't seen her in 5 years, and this could quite possibly be her last thanksgiving."
39758,So I'm breaking my own rules and I apologize to everyone out there.
39759,"True, but we're still looking at a few months more of this before we see a change."
39760,They're essentially under siege from the USA and the KSA.
39761,"There are foreign powers actively trying to topple the Iranian government, It's no surprise that they weren't able to respond efficiently to COVID."
39762,"Iranians do have a more communitarian outlook on life, though."
39763,Tested positive this past Wednesday.
39764,I had a fever and it’s gone now.
39765,But tell me does my smell/taste ever come back?
39766,:( my nose is very stuffy so it may just be that but i miss tasting food
39767,LOL.
39768,"If not, you can be my honorary kid."

39770,"It just breaks my heart to see this wonderful country (not province) being bullied to this extent, and also so many people defending China's stance by spouting some objectively false facts."
39771,"There's usually no reasoning with them so yeah, ignoring them is probably the best option, haha."
39772,"It makes me angry as a foreigner, so I can't imagine how it feels for your wife."
39773,Exactly - and  remember we have a 3-4 week lag between those two doses and then IIRC a few more weeks before someone is fully immune.
39774,"Point being that this is great, but we've got probably two months before it starts making a difference."
39775,Well we are keeping up with Thanksgiving tradition.
39776,Killing innocent people with diseases they have no immunity to.
39777,Trying to get out of a teacher contract is no joke.
39778,I was looking into it back in August.
39779,"If your district doesn't like the reason you give for leaving, they can have the state board sanction your license for a year."
39780,"Less of an issue if you don't plan to re-enter teaching, but you'd still have to potentially tell other employers that you've had a state license sanctioned, which doesn't look great on you..."
39781,"&gt; ALSO, if you test positive for covid with no symptoms you're expected to work."
39782,jesus christ.
39783,Morons.

39788,There are far too many people in positions of power that don't understand enough science or don't care enough to listen to experts.
39789,"I mean, look at the way most of the US is treating the virus, so many states don't even have mask mandates."
39790,pretty sure reading comprehension ain't your thing.
39791,fuck off.
39792,"&gt; Germans are recieving up to $7,326 monthly

Uhhhhhhh where is my 7k then?"
39793,Idk where you got that number but we aren't getting that here.
39794,Yeah well it looks like it works doesn’t it?
39795,I don’t think it’s a coincidence he goes on and on about it.
39796,You got it backwards.
39797,"He is still privy to information you and I aren’t, so he likely knew about this before he even got sick."
39798,Which explains why he’s talking about it.
39799,It’s no secret he can’t keep anything important to himself.
39800,He needs to share with the world that he’s smart and powerful.
39801,Otherwise they might forget him (that’s how smart and powerful he is).
39802,If remdesivir got approved for emergency use it would be a different story.
39803,"also, the damage this will do to your healthcare system for years to come."
39804,These people are not replaceable on a whim.
39805,Don't ever let the people responsible for this forget what they did here.
39806,Shouldn’t it?
39807,We are paying our employees to run our Navy.
39808,We need to see how well they are doing so we can make informed hiring decisions at the next election.
39809,"oh ok lol, well that makes way more sense...those ""/s"" marks make all the difference"
39810,"Then I’m curious how quickly this would reduce the projected fatalities, flatten the curve"
39811,Friend caught it - he had a fever for 2 days and lost his sense of taste for one day.
39812,There's no telling the viral load and how your body will react.
39813,"I can't sit here and be an armchair doctor, ***but from what I've read***, reinfection is rare, but not totally impossible."
39814,The whole thing with the vaccine and having it and catching it again isn't antibodies as much as memory cells.
39815,"When you come in contact with the virus again, your body fires off memory cells/antibodies to fight it."
39816,Sometimes the memory cells aren't fast enough and and some of the virus gets through.
39817,"On the other hand, sometimes the viral load you experience (when having it) isn't high enough to trigger antibodies."
39818,That first reinfection that happened during the summer when everyone freaked out?
39819,"Doctors found that the individual had a very, very mild case and it didn't trigger enough antibodies to fight it the second time."
39820,So to answer your question - idk.
39821,You gotta do what you're comfortable doing.
39822,Having the virus and beating it doesn't mean stripping your mask off and going to every grocery store and bar.
39823,You still need to wear your mask out of respect to others and because reinfection is still possible (although rare).
39824,BUT... there's people that haven't caught it who are returning to their lives so.... why shouldn't you do what you're comfortable doing?
39825,Just be smart.
39826,**Antibodies aren't an excuse to be anti-mask.
39827,** At least not right now.
39828,Be safe.
39829,Be smart.
39830,And don't be reckless.
39831,Wishing you and your family a speedy recovery
39832,Rural communities will be devastated.
39833,"Example, middle Nebraska county, one large hospital with 5 ICU beds."
39834,It services around 65k people.
39835,An outbreak in that area will kill way more people because they simply don’t have an effective capacity for treatment.
39836,That’s the tornado.
39837,"Welp, that sucks for them."
39838,"I would thinking nursing students would want to at least not jeopardize others, especially patients."
39839,"Just telling you what it says -- and either way the point is the same, this doesn't mean 40 million people will be vaccinated by the end of the year."
39840,By disregarding the whims of individualists and emphasizing the greater good.
39841,Extremely strict lockdowns.
39842,Is $15 cheap for a turkey?
39843,"I'm from Australia, we'd pay about $8 aud for a chicken."
39844,&gt; You get to be as safe as you want to be.
39845,Not when you have to go into work five days a week.
39846,Do you think we’ve learned anything from this whole ordeal that could help us prevent future pandemics?
39847,Have we strengthened our defenses?
39848,I fear that we’ll come out of all this and be no better off than before we came into it.
39849,If the pandemic was much deadlier including to children and young adults would we still be seeing all these looney anti-maskers and anti-mitigation fools?
39850,If the next pandemic is much worse than covid how screwed are we?
39851,We need to pour trillions of dollars into pandemic preparedness.

39856,"If I break the rules, I do slightly better and overall we do slightly worse."
39857,Everyone else thought of that idea though dipshits.
39858,Forty-seven percent of voters saw four years of this and signed up for another four.
39859,"Of that group, 80 percent is willing to completely overturn the democratic process to give their preferred candidate the election."
39860,We're a failed state.
39861,I'm not sure why your focus is so set on millionaires or becoming a millionaire.
39862,"Most of us aren't striving to be millionaires, we're striving to be successful."
39863,"Becoming a millionaire would certainly be successful, and it'd set our family up for even greater opportunities, but we don't need millions of dollars to consider ourselves successful."
39864,We just need good work ethic and to achieve our best.
39865,That's success.
39866,And we do see that in people like Jeff Bezos who took a little online book shop into a massive online retailer.
39867,Good for him!
39868,How'd he do it?
39869,He worked his ass off and he solved a problem.
39870,People pay for problem solvers.
39871,That's how we see it.
39872,"Don't be a problem, be a problem solver."
39873,"Find a solution to a problem, work at it, and market it to others."
39874,Invest in your future.
39875,"Alternatively, just demand capital from people who are more successful than you because you didn't earn it."

39885,Stay the fuck home.
39886,I'm so sorry you're in this situation.
39887,I'm a healthcare worker too and it really hurts to hear how people in our professions are treated as expendable.
39888,"It was bad enough in normal times, but this is just another level of crazy."
39889,"What hurts the most is that literally all it would take to avoid this much suffering is everybody being a little considerate to each other, but apparently that's just way too much to ask."
39890,I hope things turn around for you soon.
39891,Elbow bump from an internet stranger
39892,Omg USA
39893,Solid statistics
39894,"Right, but we're still talking a bit down the road -- once they start delivering the vaccines (I've heard mid-to-late December) people still need two doses, spaced 3 or 4 weeks apart (depending on vaccine)."
39895,"So lets say optimistically our first batch of 20 million people are immune in late January -  that's still enough time for 50,000 to 100,000 deaths."
39896,"Not saying this to be a downer, these vaccines are amazing and revolutionary."
39897,Just stressing that we still need to be vigilant for a few months before we see any improvement.
39898,And let's remember how long two months is - in February we wouldn't imagine living like this for even a few weeks.
39899,Can I move off this planet?
39900,I don't think I'm human.
39901,I don't like bars even in non-pandemic times.
39902,That’s a bad response.
39903,The cocktail is the first treatment to be out on the market that actually has a real affect on the virus in people.
39904,You’re response is basically: it’s not available enough so I downvote it.
39905,People who’s immune systems are compromised won’t benefit from a vaccine and this is their answer.
39906,"Yeah, that's a scary realization."

39937,"&gt; Funnily enough, if there's one country in the world that's close to that stereotype, that would be China."
39938,"True, but there's another stereotype that actually fits the united states, it's the stereotype about the country where there's no health insurance and everybody believe that if you are poor you deserve to die."
39939,I always got the impression that this and not having sick days generally increased the spread of Covid in the US.
39940,"Note that I'm talking specifically about the US though, as most of the US does have health insurance and stricter work laws."
39941,"From Kansas, did the same thing"
39942,People can't take accountability when there is no money coming into a household and they live in fear of losing everything they have by no fault of their own.
39943,"I have no particular insight into the economics of delivering vaccines, but retail markup tends to be around 100%."

39956,"Even if India has 7 billion people, the per capita would still be astronomical compared to, say, Vietnam."
39957,It is obvious that the 133k number would imply a really high per capita deaths (from my perspective) no matter the country.
39958,Yes.
39959,If you can get a N95 mask you’ll most likely be fine

39974,"If they spread the disease and someone else dies then that person dies in a hospital, out of sight, out of mind."
39975,It's a truly abhorrent mindset.

39990,Now go find a study that counters it or go away.

39999,The CDC (and WHO) have flip flopped their stances so many times based on political motivations it's not even worth talking about.
40000,"The question is, what does the actual *evidence* show?"
40001,"The public just chose to switch administrations, with those voting against the current administration citing coronavirus as the most important issue."
40002,"An overwhelming percentage of independent voters voted for a change in leadership, as well."
40003,People voted with their vote.
40004,"It *is* pretty funny to think about the implications of conflating college-aged, impulse-driven behaviors to the societal norms of the entire voting public, though."
40005,"Remember everyone, because reported deaths are fucky with the republican states attempting to hide/downplay/ignore Covid."
40006,It's excess deaths above baseline.
40007,"When the annual influenza wave hits, and we have grandmas with broken hips and femurs from falling on ice that don't get treated (leading to hemorrhage, or infection), that's when numbers REALLY climb."
40008,"&gt;Did you really say

&gt;Boo Hoo, right?"
40009,Poor me.
40010,Everyone has issues.

40016,This is exactly why a vaccine is our only hope of ever getting this virus under control.
40017,Too many people are either too stupid or too selfish to do what is needed to protect themselves and others.
40018,What a different holiday season this might have been had more people taken the virus seriously from the very beginning.

40024,"Speaking with hospital workers, reading articles, taking in information from multiple sources."
40025,The first lockdown did little more than what happened outside the first two weeks of flattening the curve.
40026,There is absolutely not a good reason for a new one now.
40027,"As most pandemics do, they use their limited rna space to spread more."
40028,Killing your host isn't beneficial for reproduction.
40029,"We have close to the lowest deaths per day count yet depending on the area, the highest cases there has been."
40030,Common sense doesn’t mean people are going to care.
40031,"If you polled people across the U.S., I would bet 90% of people would give you the right answer for what you are supposed to do."
40032,That doesn’t mean people will actually care.
40033,&gt;Solution is socialize education and health care.
40034,It's not quite as easy as a snap of the finger.
40035,"I agree that's the long term solution, but there are huge economic machines in place that will be disrupted by those changes."
40036,"Ultimately these disruptions will impact people, and we need to make sure those people are taken care of, too."
40037,We also need to put safeguards in place so that the existing healthcare/education infrastructure that's grifting the American people doesn't have a chance to grift the American people through the government.
40038,"Otherwise, nothing will fundamentally change."
40039,&gt; Do away with the war machine and scrutinize government spending.
40040,&gt;It works for many countries and can definitely work for us.
40041,Unfortunately it works for other countries because they rely on the existence of the American war machine.
40042,"As ugly and seemingly unnecessary as the American war machine seems, it's the primary reason we've had relative global peace for almost a century."
40043,"Any retraction in the American footprint will allow the Chinese footprint to expand -- if they still had a leader like Hu Jintao, I'd say it's not a huge problem."
40044,"But they don't have Jintao, they have Winnie the Nazi, and any expansion of their military footprint while Xi is in charge is bad for everyone involved."

40057,Tbh the word exponential is wildly misused by this sub.
40058,People say exponential which most people interpret as doubling every day or something related.
40059,When really exponential could be n to the power of 1.1 or 1.05 or 1.6.
40060,"Its not just because it's exponential it's bad, you have to look at what the actual power is to determine how severe the growth is."

40065,I doubt that but you never know.
40066,Well in some ways this risk taking behavior is exactly what sent us to the moon.
40067,Going to the moon was incredibly dangerous and had a high risk of failure and was also based entirely on technology developed to lob missiles across the planet to vaporize several hundred thousand of your enemies at once.
40068,Risk taking is integral to human advancement.
40069,"Sadly, in cases like pandemics it leads to widespread tragedy and death."
40070,Tbh the best way to discourage it would be to play up how expensive such a trip could be.
40071,Crash your car in snowy conditions a few thousand miles from home?
40072,That would add up
40073,Proof brains don’t necessarily matter.

40075,"I predict we'll still be seeing people write, ""they died with Corona, not from...""."

40077,Take care of yourself too.

40085,It seems as if many people will have to have their area to go through this to understand it.
40086,Here in Ontario I keep hearing of people's older relatives heading to Florida for the winter regardless of their age and preexisting health conditions.
40087,People are super stubborn.
40088,So enjoy Christmas then deal with NHS overload and total lockdown on the new year hmm.

40091,I'm a medical worker.
40092,"Your ""choice"" means 16 hour shifts for me and mine, multiple dead colleagues and several who have had months long dibilitation."
40093,"These ""choices"" are literally killing us."
40094,It spreads the disese faster and means more people overall have it at any one given point.
40095,"So just like we revile people who make the choice to go and get drunk before driving home and smashing into sidewalk full of people, we revile people that help spread an easily preventable disease to us because they won't take the basic fucking steps to prevent it."
40096,"There's no cure, but there is treatment."
40097,"Hospitals have learned and are better at treating people now than at the start of the pandemic, you'll have significantly better chances for improved outcome if you can get care vs. if the hospitals are overrun."
40098,"And of course hospitals being full affects all healthcare, not just treatment for COVID-19."
40099,&gt; its their risk.
40100,"not yours

Actually, it’s other people’s risk as well."
40101,"If even just one person catches covid there, they can easily spread it while being asymptomatic."
40102,And those people can spread it even further
40103,Their pre-clinical results were on a 1-dose regimen.
40104,"Their clinical trials in humans contain both 1 and 2 dose, but nAB titers and cellular response for their 2-dose in P1/2 was very similar to all the others."
40105,"Which is why the expectation is that J&amp;J, Oxford, and ESPECIALLY Novavax will work."
40106,"NV had the most robust response of any vaccine so far, and all the vaccines right now are targeting the spike protein like PFE and Moderna."

40127,Can someone explain to me how is the Pfizer vaccine considered to be effective?
40128,They reported that it's 95% effective because only 8 people got ill with Covid.
40129,"But if 8 people are the 5%, doesn't this mean that the sample size is ridiculously small?"
40130,How can any conclusions be drawn from the results of less than 200 people?

40158,"Everyone was suddenly allowed to get tested, numbers went up, and quickly down."
40159,Which showed that the virus was far more widespread than the FHM had been claiming - remember for months before the FHM had been claiming the number of cases had plateaued.
40160,"Then when they started testing more people, it was obvious it hadn't."

40170,One concern I’ve heard with the two-dose vaccines is they have common side effects that essentially feels like a hangover.
40171,Many people who would be willing to get a first dose might not be willing to get a second dose.
40172,"If that’s the case, then even a less effective single-dose vaccine might be preferable (for society—not for use as an individual) because people will actually get it."
40173,A two-dose vaccine that people won’t complete won’t help us.

40186,Aye we even had a set of friends that said we can't get any life updates until we see them in person.
40187,Pretty shitty but it turns out it matches their behavior otherwise so this whole thing has revealed quite a bit about people's character.

40309,Lots of people have caught it and most people are fine.
40310,"If you catch it and don’t have a severe illness, you will almost certainly recover fully."
40311,None of that is to say that it’s not horrific because lots of people do have serious illness from it and die.
40312,But you also don’t want to necessarily freak out the millions of people that have caught it that they’re never going to be better.
40313,"I Know you can't really tip on curbside, but do extra for your deliveries whenever possible."

40322,&gt; The notion that the handling of a once-in-a-100-years pandemic has any bearing on the capability of a nation to ensure a good life for its citizens for the remaining 99 years is ridiculous.
40323,Oh yea?
40324,"Do you know about the history of the United States and how well they have historically treated the descendants of African slaves for instance, or any of the people from the nations the US has decided to randomly attack?"
40325,Do you think it's just a coincidence that the attitude the US has towards the lives of the poor masses is actively spiteful during the pandemic?

40348,We’ve all had covid so hope there is some immunity associated with that (in that we aren’t carriers).
40349,Still very unsure what to do.
40350,But assuming everyone can “just wait” is a pretty big assumption.
40351,And “what’s special” about the dates is people have off work.
40352,It’s really ignorant to assume all the people of the world are working from the same set of assumptions that only lead to one possible conclusion.

40487,"You, and everyone else defending and enabling this shit are the problem."
40488,I'm done because I know Im not going to change your mind.

40503,They made recommendation that public not travel during this holiday
40504,"&gt; According to Lopez-Gonzalez, this is not the first time an infectious respiratory disease has led to this phenomenon, noting a similar increased risk in influenza patients."
40505,"“There is still a lot of research to be done when it comes to COVID-19 and stroke, but stroke symptoms should never be ignored."""
40506,From your article.
40507,Yes.
40508,"99.98 isn’t 100, and I realize that’s not the hospitalization rate, which is higher."
40509,That said the article doesn’t really prove that COVID-19 is radically different from Influenza like illnesses as far as long term effects.
40510,It would have to be pretty serious to get people to not do thanksgiving.
40511,"We are all aware of the mortality rate , it’s simply not high enough to deter most people ."
40512,How did you catch the virus ?
40513,"370,798 dead so far of pneumonia, influenza and covid according to the CDC."
40514,"About 7k of those had tested positive for influenza (probably most came from jan, feb and march, before we implemented measures)."
40515,"A lot of viruses do not kill the patient directly, but weaken the immune system enough that they succumb to bacterial, fungal and/ or viral pneumonia of other types."
40516,"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/index.htm


Also, that's just the death certificates that have been processed so far."
40517,"From the source I linked (CDC -  excess deaths by week and state)


""It is important to note that it can take several weeks for death records to be submitted to National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), processed, coded, and tabulated."
40518,"Therefore, the data shown on this page may be incomplete, and will likely not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period, especially for the more recent time periods."
40519,Death counts for earlier weeks are continually revised and may increase or decrease as new and updated death certificate data are received from the states by NCHS.

40526,This carefree bullshit doesnt even come from a place of mental health they literally think covid is a hoax and that masks are fake news.
40527,This is why America is number one in cases and for you to come in here and act like that the bare minimum that were asking to get this shit under control is too much and too easy at the same time just makes you look like a fool.

40651,"&gt; no it's not

I guess you fall into the ""oblivious"" category then?"
40652,that comparison is bullshit because the total population is much bigger.

40663,Most interesting statement he made was the potential for herd immunity to be established in the USA by May.

40674,"There’s honestly no progress to be made with posts like this, articles like this, and the constant “what the fuck are you thinking” type content and such."
40675,It’s done.
40676,Tens of millions of our citizens have been brainwashed by Trump and his idiot administration into not giving a fuck.
40677,"Trump weaponized his bases idiocy, he weaponized their worship of him, and he tries to leverage it to get re-elected and maintain power."
40678,"He completely lost control of the covid pandemic and instead of owning up to it he instructed his heard of cult-like followers to feverishly avoid any and every precaution, and to even out right deny the threat."
40679,The left blasted them and made it even more of a political issue.
40680,"They/we/I made personal attacks against these idiots, and even if they are deserved it serves to make them double down on their positions."
40681,As a result these people’s identities are now intertwined with their covid stance.

The propaganda campaign of weaponized misinformation has been a huge success, amd the opposition to it has responded in the worst way they could and made the situation worse."
40684,It backfired.
40685,Why can’t the stupid local government suspend/cancel their business license for breaking regulations/protocols?
40686,All it takes is a few example places being shutdown before others to abide to the rules.

40691,"While I definitely agree that the state of the US is totally inexcusable, saying that being an island doesn't help is kinda BS."

40704,"Definitely comorbidities, but if it wasn't Covid I'd be very surprised."
40705,No autopsy so we'll never know.
40706,What is this supposed to mean?
40707,The two antibodies prevent the virus spike protein from binding to ACE2 by blocking the binding sites on the virus.
40708,"That is different from an ACE2 inhibitor, which would either inhibit expression of ACE2 or prevent ACE2 from downstream signaling."

40710,Just because you’re too ignorant to understand the germ theory of disease and how it’s transmitted doesn’t mean people who do are insane.
40711,I worked in Keystone in the ski industry.
40712,I’ll never forget March 14th (the day Keystone shut down).
40713,At the beginning of the day I was reassuring my friend (she had just bought a house and was terrified they were going to shut down the ski shop) that Keystone would never close.
40714,"At the end, we were watching in silence with some other employees, drinking a beer, as Keystone set off all of their fireworks for the entirety of the season."
40715,It’s stupid but I will never forget that as long as I live.
40716,"For a ski resort to shut down in the middle of the season, it honestly felt like the end of the world."
40717,"And then the kicker, when you find out that YOUR OWN FAMILY shares those same idiotic beliefs?"

40728,&gt;Fauci is the closest thing we have to a “scientist warning about the apocalypse and no one pays attention to him” at the beginning of an apocalypse movie.

40749,"yes its possible, this is from the article-"" However, the rapid spread, the large number of patients requiring hospital admission and treatment in intensive care units, as well as the duration of the pandemic suggest that the arrival of the virus and its circulation in Italy in a less symptomatic form could be anticipated by several months.

40792,This is the response I always get.
40793,And this mentality speaks to the toxicity and ignorance of American individualism.
40794,People can’t be bothered to make small sacrifices in their daily lives to protect others who may get sick and die from this.
40795,"And no, it’s not just 80+ year old people who make up the 250k death toll."
40796,"Young people, immunocompromised people, even otherwise healthy people have gotten sick and died from this."
40797,"And when people die from covid, it’s not pretty."
40798,"They’re in the ICU, with tubes and lines in them, getting medications to stabilize their blood pressure."
40799,Meanwhile they’re slowly drowning in their secretions from the virus wreaking havoc on their immune systems.
40800,"And when they do die, they die alone, or surrounded by hospital staff in pseudo-hazmat suits who just tried to revive them for 30 mins."
40801,Then their bodies get cremated to prevent further spread of the virus.
40802,Not to mention the possible long-term effects that covid can have in the body.
40803,"I worry that now I’ll be at higher risk of heart attacks and strokes because covid has been linked to increased blood clotting formation, for example."

40812,"I think there will be an initial, chaotic rush with confused people pestering their doctors, traveling long distances to get it and finding there isn't any."

They're doing this right now, during final projects and exams, and give you 72 hours from the time of notification to get your test done."

40823,Not once.
40824,Not even to drive through it.
40825,"And then suddenly I needed to go in person to a place where they know there are cases, putting myself and my roommates at risk of exposure, otherwise they'll lock my out of contacting my teachers while I have final projects due."
40826,"On top of all the disgusting money-grabbing things they've done all semester (and in their very, very long history of screwing their students over) they're making it difficult for their students to even do the work they've paid at MINIMUM ten grand to do."
40827,If you look into the pathology of the lung injury caused by vape oil you can see that it's very different to the lung impairment caused by covid in a CT scan.

42167,It’s not
42168,Florida is just a different world entirely.

42170,Serious.
42171,No masks allowed.

42177,Stay safe and do what’s best for you guys!
42178,Let's say you have a group of 6-10 friends (3-4 couples in the same household) you want to see and trust are being safe.
42179,There are two options -- gathering with each couple 1-1 throughout the week so it would be max 4 people at a time or gathering all 10 people at one time for a meal like Thanksgiving.
42180,Is there significantly more risk in the second option?

42188,No one thinks a lockdown until Christmas 2021 is necessary.
42189,Spreading such rumors weakens the efforts needed for this years holiday season.
42190,How can their rhetoric be false when they're posting direct quotations?
42191,The Public Health Agency changed their story and that's an indisputable fact at this point ever since the mail correspondence between Tegnell and Peet Tüll was revealed in which Tegnell says they've chosen the herd immunity route.
42192,"Either way, reddit is not to blame for the spread of the herd immunity idea."
42193,"That's on the Public Health Agency themselves, since they didn't hesitate to participate in various media outlets worldwide to talk about herd immunity in relation to Sweden (which you obviously don't do if that's not something you're engaged in)."

42263,no its worse.

42335,That’s not what I’m saying at all.
42336,We actually have more coronavirus in Florida than there ever was in the entire country of China.
42337,And we did it on purpose.
42338,We knew what we were doing.
42339,"The state hired people who lied to the citizens, and the newspaper told everyone they were lying; and the citizens knew they were lying."
42340,But they all did it anyway.
42341,And there will be people who insist we are telling the truth when the truth is that we are obviously and flagrantly lying.
42342,That’s the difference.
42343,In China they tried to cover up their crimes: we are just trying to pretend they aren’t crimes.
42344,Which is worse?
42345,I think being willfully and deliberately ignorant is a lot worse than a simple coverup.
42346,"There are currently  about 5 million active cases in the US, which means about 1.5% of our population is currently infected."
42347,"So, yeah, For every 100 people on a flight more than one has covid."
42348,It would be great if ALL of that 1.5% of the US that are sick could just stay home but they won't.
42349,Then there are the likely 2 million more who are asymptomatic.
42350,[removed]
42351,How many were on the flight?
42352,That seems kinda impressive and reassuring that a positive testing passenger ONLY infected 4.

42366,Those people are less likely to be tested.

42374,The only *fact* is October 18th had the highest flights to date.
42375,October 18th is not Thanksgiving.
42376,Thanksgiving has not occurred yet.
42377,"After it had, the responsible way to process data would be to compare flight numbers against pre-pandemic numbers."
42378,Paired with a questioning of each individual flying over this Thanksgiving week of their flight purpose.
42379,"As we both know that is not going to happen, we both know that accurate data collection is not possible/going to happen."
42380,"As such, people like you (who like to loosely guesstimate), and members of media outlets that need stories ....and operate in your fashion... will paint the same picture for gullible public consumption."
42381,"&gt;The nation’s health experts on Sunday pleaded with Americans to stay home over the Thanksgiving holiday and forgo any plans to travel or celebrate at large family gatherings, even as airports have recorded a significant rise in passengers."
42382,"&gt;Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the country’s top infectious disease specialist, and other health experts relayed a clear message on Sunday morning news shows: with coronavirus cases surging to record levels across the country, turning nearly every state into a hot zone of transmission, the risk of getting infected, whether in transit or in even small indoor gatherings, is high."
42383,"&gt;Up to 50 million people could be traveling on roads and through airports in the United States over Thanksgiving this year, according to AAA, the biggest travel surge since the pandemic began, despite strong cautions from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other health authorities."
42384,A video of a packed airport in Phoenix has been circulating widely on social media.
42385,"As of Sunday, 47 states — all but Vermont, Maine and Hawaii — were considered high-risk zones for viral transmission, and nationwide hospitalizations were at a record 83,227."
42386,"&gt;Please seriously consider decisions that you make,” Dr. Fauci said on the CBS show “Face the Nation.” Encountering large numbers of people in airports and on planes is particularly dangerous, he said."
42387,"Although airlines have invested in air circulation and ventilation systems to minimize viral transmission, Dr. Fauci said, “sometimes when you get a crowded plane, or you’re in a crowded airport, you’re lining up, not everybody’s wearing masks — that puts yourself at risk.”

&gt;And gathering indoors, whether you travel or not, carries risk."
42388,"“When you’re eating and drinking, obviously, you have to take your mask off,” Dr. Fauci said."
42389,"“We know now that those are the kinds of situations that are leading to outbreaks.”

&gt;Dr. Tom Inglesby, director of the Center for Health Security of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said on Fox News Sunday that because about half of infections are spread by people who don’t have any symptoms, “you can’t assume that you don’t have the virus, and you can’t assume that the people whose home you’re about to enter don’t have the virus, at this point in our pandemic.”

&gt;He recommended celebrating Thanksgiving only with the people you live with."
42390,"People who choose to visit others’ homes should spend as much time as possible outdoors and “should be wearing masks indoors when they’re together, and only removing them when they’re eating.”

&gt;Dr. Fauci and others warned that Americans’ behavior over Thanksgiving will have critical implications for the coming weeks of the winter season, including risks to people gathering to celebrate Christmas and New Year’s, because the country is still months away from having wide access to vaccines and therapeutics and the cold weather drives more people indoors."
42391,"&gt;”We’re going to have to, you know, hunker down, reduce our interactions,” Dr. Scott Gottlieb, a former Trump administration Food and Drug Administration commissioner, said on Face the Nation."
42392,"&gt;As an example of the risk, he said that in a state like North Dakota, where case levels are high, there’s a 50 percent chance that someone in a group of 10 people has Covid-19."
42393,"“That’s the kind of risk we’re facing individually right now,” he said."
42394,“And that’s only going to get worse.”
42395,"Its quite possible I understand your comment, but California daily deaths are mostly double digits with triple digit days."
42396,"That, or the chart I look at is wrong."
42397,How bad was it?
42398,I don't want it or anything but the way my job has been operating it feels inevitable.
42399,When I was a kid in the 90s I paid 15 euros per year for public gym but  nowadays it's as expensive as everywhere
42400,You cannot eat while wearing masks.
42401,Thanksgiving is a holiday where you eat and snack the whole time.
42402,"It's a red flag, or perhaps a brown M&amp;M, that tells you that the party planners didn't do their diligence."
42403,"If it was me, I'd stay home."

42534,We just kicked out student nurses for the second time (did it in the spring and again on Friday) because they keep brining covid into the hospital and not following distancing/masking rules.

42540,And people were jumping all over me on another board the other day when I was wishing for a lockdown in our state.
42541,Stupid/ignorant people need to be protected from themselves!
42542,Germany is also the most aged country in the world together with Japan and Italy.
42543,Its results are definitely worth of praise.
42544,We certainly know which half
42545,I don't seem to understand either.
42546,You are claiming that not having lockdowns work better than having lockdowns?
42547,Can you explain why?
42548,Not impressed by my prime minister either who is saying we are are all reasonable and responsible adults who don't need to be told what to do.
42549,We will do the right thing on our own.
42550,"Meanwhile, on Facebook I watched a whole group argue the body can't absorb chemicals through the skin, because why else would we have mouths?"
42551,This is what happens when the governor passes a law strong arming mayors from man dating masks and enforcing social distancing.
42552,I think the logistics of banning interstate travel in regions like the northeast compared to a giant spread out country with populations generally centralized (like australia) are too great.
42553,"The NYC metro area has the same population as all of australia...... And even with a lot of in person work stopping, there are still a lot of workers that have to travel between NJ/NY or CT/NY everyday for work in person."
42554,it would be like if a HUGE chunk of melbourne travelled to Sydney every single day (the numbers are actually nearly twice as much as that) for work.
42555,"And the government didn't offer to give all of melbourne money to help them, but told them they could no longer work."
42556,Its one of the reasons that unfortunately some much much bigger rules need to come down to have the same impact as reasonably simple laws like those in australia.
42557,"So then, you realize, no matter how strong or healthy you are, you can die from a whole host of other things right?"
42558,And your chances of dying from those increase dramatically if there's no open hospital beds near you.
42559,What age are you?
42560,I'm curious what the odds are you'll get into a car accident and not have any hospital bed to get into because you got someone sick by not wearing a mask at the bar.
42561,"Outdoors is generally pretty safe, I would add some distancing though, as people can't eat with masks, and different family pods should ideally do different tables."
42562,&gt;I've been sitting in a pool for 3 weeks and I can still detect water!
42563,They told me if I got wet that I would dry up after a short time!
42564,Very hard to actually use.
42565,Has to be used only on milder cases if you read the limitations and it’s disallowed on hospitalized patients BUT requires an IV infusion and monitoring for an allergic reaction afterwards.
42566,That will very heavily limit where you’ll be able to get this if at all.
42567,"Our primary care doctors aren’t even allowed to see Covid cases in person, they have to been seen remotely to avoid infecting the other patients so there’s literally no way for them to offer this even if they had clinics equipped for infusions."
42568,This is gonna be a vip thing

42573,I think people downvoting you have misinterpreted your opening sentence.
42574,"“You’re welcome to lockdown all you want if you’re paranoid” is what people are saying to you, not what you’re saying."

42649,"**Translation**

Comparisons in the OECD's new report “Health at a Glance: Europe” show that Sweden is the worst of all 37 member countries in reducing the spread of infection, discharging IVA patients and making citizens isolate themselves."
42650,"The report investigates, among other things, how quickly the countries managed to limit the spread of infection after reaching the peak."
42651,"They then examined how many days it took for each country to bring the r number down to below 1, after a high listing."
42652,The national r-number shows the number of people to whom each infected person on average spreads the virus.
42653,Sweden topped the OECD's list by 58 days.
42654,"In comparison, the corresponding figure was 43 in Finland, 38 in Denmark and 27 in Norway."
42655,"The fastest spread of infection was in Malta, where it took eleven days before the r-number reached below 1."
42656,"When it comes to discharge of IVA patients, Sweden was also behind the other countries."
42657,The report looked at how the number of IVAs developed after the peak of new inpatients was reached.
42658,"In countries where tougher closures were introduced, such as France, Ireland and the Netherlands, the number fell rapidly, while it took much longer in Sweden."
42659,The reduction that took four weeks in the Netherlands and France took eleven in Sweden.
42660,Sweden was also last in the comparison of how different populations have changed their movement patterns.
42661,"Between March and May, Swedes reduced their movement pattern by 7.4 percent."
42662,"It is lower than the neighboring countries Norway (10.3 per cent) and Denmark (9.7) and a sharp difference with Spain, where citizens' movements decreased by 22.2 per cent during the period."
42663,Anders Tegnell does not want to draw too great conclusions from the OECD report.
42664,Anders Tegnell does not want to draw too great conclusions from the OECD report.
42665,"Photo: Henrik Montgomery / TT
 State epidemiologist Anders Tegnell believes that the results in the report are interesting, but that more context is needed to be able to draw conclusions from the comparisons."
42666,- I think it is great that the material has been produced and then a continued discussion is needed about what it really means.
42667,"That you quickly get down to below r1, for example."
42668,"The one who tests less gets faster results than the one who tests a lot, says Anders Tegnell to the journalist Emanuel Karlsten."
42669,The OECD also emphasizes in the report that further studies are needed to ensure whether there is a connection between tougher closures of society and the rapidly declining spread of infection.
42670,The organization also does not present any conclusions from the figures.
42671,From an outsider perspective (I’m not American and don’t live in the US) it seems crazy to keep public schools closed when inequality is so bad in the states already.
42672,Having private schools open and public ones closer will surely give wealthy students another leg up on their poor counterparts?
42673,"More like 350,000 by Christmas"
42674,And the simple-minded can only exist in this state.

42676,"Thats a treatment for rich people, its not a vaccine"
42677,"Nah there are lots of people like /u/thundersteel21, they are not on their own."
42678,It just feels that way because the people doing the right thing are not visible.
42679,The people behaving like jackasses are.
42680,Like I am not going to go on facebook and brag about staying out of restaurants and bars for eight months.
42681,Selfish narcissists are definitely going to plaster all their partying on social and end up in stories like this one.
42682,How can she force you?
42683,"Unless your grandma has a gun to your head, or pays your bills and is threatening to withhold the rent money if you don’t go, or similar, you’re traveling on your own free will."
42684,"From some quick looking up seems to be almost 50mil people 65+ in America and around 18mil ""healthcare"" workers (not sure what that all includes as healthcare but it doesn't include frontline like police or fire) obv."
42685,There will be some overlapping between healthcare workers who are 65+ and older but best guess is there is about 70mil in those 2 populations alone.
42686,If the artical is correct and 40mil doses = 20mil vacinated then not even half of this population will be covered in the first batchs.
42687,"What that means for ""does it get us most of the way there?"""
42688,No damn clue.
42689,"You've taken a positive position insisting on neutrality, which is a self-defeating proposition."
42690,If you care about such things.
42691,Other than the 7 figure outlier; the numbers look quite similar from August to now.
42692,Would they have enough production capacity to be able to give out the doses to more then 20 million with the assumption that they’ll have enough to cover them 4 weeks later?
42693,If you don’t wanna go out then stay home.
42694,Stop imposing your beliefs on others.
42695,Yea sorry masks are gonna become a lifetime requirement like seat belts.
42696,Oh yeah definitely.
42697,If the doubling rate since October keeps up there will be over 1 million cases daily by Christmas.
42698,"At this point, the only thing I see preventing that is if you run out of tests."
42699,&gt;eg.
42700,bad handling of masks and less social distancing in exchange.
42701,Huh?
42702,I thought Swedes could be trusted to follow recommendations?
42703,Why would they suddenly stop following them if another was added?
42704,1.
42705,I am not arguing that they go to school with the primary purpose of being child care.
42706,Of course the main purpose of school is education.
42707,2.
42708,"Yes, you're correct."
42709,Parents pay for the childcare before and after school.
42710,"However, the point I am making is that if the schools had no concern for the fact that parents work they wouldn't offer these programs on campus."
42711,Educators do realize that parents work and the kids are in their care for hours a day.
42712,As a result they have programs that allow that duration to be longer.
42713,Same reason why schools have summer care programs.
42714,Because they are aware that parents work and need a place to have their kids while they're working.
42715,3.
42716,I never said they exist solely for parents to work.
42717,The fact that school occurs during the work day makes it very convenient for parents to work while their kids are cared for.
42718,The parents understand this and the schools understand this.
42719,"As a direct result, parents get jobs with the understanding that they can work while their kids is in school."
42720,You can't just ignore that simple fact as it is the reality.
42721,I run a company that would be considered blue collar.
42722,"The employees that work in my organization perform jobs that can't be done virtually, get paid hourly, most live pay check-to-pay check, and both the parents work."
42723,"These employees take these types of jobs because they \*know\* they don't have to worry about their kids from 8am-3pm M-F.  On one random day, the government decides to pull the plug on that with no backup plan, it can become a disaster."
42724,4.
42725,I think you're looking at this too narrowly.
42726,"I am not discounting their primary purpose, just simply making a point that their second, third, fourth, fifth, etc."
42727,"purposes are pretty damn important too and before you make the decision to close them you need to understand the ramifications of the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc."
42728,purpose as well.
42729,My school (and many others) were polling sites just a few weeks ago.
42730,They closed the schools in the entire county for the day because there was polling taking place at the schools.
42731,"If the primary purpose of schools is only to educate and there is no other purpose at all, why did they do this?"
42732,Because they also serve other purposes.
42733,"Again, don't confuse that I don't think this is a mess."
42734,I don't like this any more than anyone else does.
42735,"But when I hear things like ""close schools"" I shudder because it is one of those things that has to be so carefully thought of before you do it because of the extreme implications."
42736,I think the elected officials we have in place had no plan for anything like this and were more concerned with appeasing a group of individuals than rolling up the sleeves and coming up with a real plan that would address these concerns for EVERYONE.
42737,Our half assed attempts at lock downs and shut downs have done essentially nothing.
42738,"&gt;I think 2021 won't happen

How's that going to work?"
42739,"Like, at midnight on New Year's everything goes black for a moment and then we all see the words, ""One year later"" as our sight returns?"
42740,I could live with that.
42741,"With a 2 - 7 record, fan apathy is the greatest danger right now."
42742,We have been for a while.
42743,Our Governor is one of the worst in terms of taking this seriously and I dont know if it's the meth in the tap water or what but even those I know that I would consider intelligent just don't really give a shit.
