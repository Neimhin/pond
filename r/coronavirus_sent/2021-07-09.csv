0,That's literally the worst part about the pandemic.
1,People are gonna die or become chronically ill even after the pandemic is over because their treatments were delayed too much.

10,"Even with the new more infectious delta variant, you are strongly protected against severe disease (getting hospitalized)."
11,"However, if youve had a lot of contact with her there is still a non-trivial probability of catching an asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic case of covid."
12,"So dont be worried for your health, but do keep an eye out for any symptoms, and get tested if you feel anything."
13,My kiddos school requires proof of vaccination for attendance.
14,I‚Äôd be curious how you weigh the risks of COVID issues vs the risks of not developing socially and generally being at a heightened anxiety level?
15,(Plus the intangibles like missing another year of making childhood memories)

18,It's really hard to compare countries to other countries because everything is so specific.
19,I wouldn't be surprised if the US simply also has more infected people overall because some Americans weren't careful to begin with during the height of the pandemic.
20,We probably have a good amount of people naturally infected on top of people who are vaccinated that helps to slow down the spread.
21,"We are also a couple weeks behind the UK so some people are saying its a matter of time, we will see."
22,"At this point, cases going up is not surprising."
23,"The question is, will hospitalizations go up as well?"
24,We can't freak out every time cases go up because that is just inevitable once you open things up.
25,"&amp;#x200B;

I sometimes wonder if prolonged lockdowns can actually be a bit harmful because there probably is something to be said for a bit of natural immunity as well."
26,"My guess is the CDC dropped mask mandates so that herd immunity, either through vaccinations or naturally is sped up."
27,"For your sister, yes, but not for yourself"
28,Hope not.
29,I'm comfortable being out with people and not wearing a mask in most situations as I'm fully vacced.
30,"I do wear it at the grocery store because it's one place that everyone, healthy and sick alike, need to visit."
31,"Yup, can confirm."
32,"First shot was awful, but zero effects from the second."
33,Great!
34,But the majority of the 12-17 y/o are NOT vaccinated which is My point
35,He had a wall of text that rambled on about masking forever.
36,I'll admit the person who went into cardiac arrest is a mutual friend but my Step-dad was literally diagnosed and is in hospital.
37,I just feel like based on the fact that I know of 2 separate cardiac events in healthy men in my small area related to the second dose it makes me scared.
38,As someone who smokes I'm even more afraid.
39,"üò∞

I promise I'm being genuine..."
40,I just don't know what to think.
41,At the end of the day I probably still get the vaccine because it's the better option anyway.
42,Edit: thanks for the info by the way!
43,I had the first dose of the shingles vaccine back in January and it made me sick with a 101.5 fever for two days.
44,I‚Äôd never had a bad reaction to a vaccine before that.
45,Got the Moderna doses a couple of months ago and aside from some minor aches and pains felt fine.
46,"My sense is that you, like me, never really cared about vaccine side effects or followed social media posts about them."
47,It‚Äôs like product reviews on Amazon.
48,Even the most highly rated items will still have a ton of negative reviews that say it‚Äôs the worst thing they ever bought.
49,Covid is here forever.
50,It will be seasonal like the flu.
51,It is never going away.
52,I don't understand what people like you think the end game is.
53,Lock down forever?
54,"Even once everyone is vaccinated, covid will remain, evolve, and cause illness."
55,If it's causing the same death rate of the flu - which is now the case for vaccinated individuals - there's zero reason to remain closed.
56,It's never going to stop causing infections.
57,We just hit 41% fully vaccinated actually.
58,Another big thing is we are reporting around 50 new cases daily vs the 500+ NL was reporting when they opened up.
59,"We also have more indoor restrictions (limited capacity, no dancing, sit down only, no mingling between tables)

Hopefully we don‚Äôt see a spike‚Ä¶"
60,"I feel like everyone is forgetting that most adults are vaccinated at this point, especially the vulnerable people."
61,The second thing people forget is that there have been a lot more tests done in the last week.
62,If you look at the graphs it's very much correlated with the increase in infection.
63,"So yes it was a little premature, but there is no chance we'll see march 2020 again."
64,"And you can see this by looking at hospitalisations and IC hospitalisations, which are 10 and 0 respectively."
65,"The infections are going to be high, there is no escaping that."
66,"It's like everyone forgot vaccinations don't stop infections, it just makes the symptoms less severe."
67,Unless we keep the country on lockdown forever infections are going to skyrocket.
68,It's meant to happen.
69,"Technically any fixed percentage of growth is ""exponential"": my savings account that pays 0.01% per year (seriously!)"
70,"would be growing ""exponentially""... doubling every 70 centuries."
71,"R of 1.01 would double every 7000 cycles if maintained long enough, but that isn't the scary ""doubling every 3 weeks"" people think of - and if it's that close to 1 it can easily dip to 0.99, which means slow shrinkage instead of growth."
72,I bet conspiracy nuts are blowing their collective gaskets right now
73,Except of course when not getting a vaccine puts both yourself and your patients unnecessarily at risk.
74,Fingers crossed your reckless actions won't end up in someone dying because you feared vaccines that have had decades of research done to make sure they're safe.
75,[removed]
76,"Assuming you got the delta variant, the second dose gives you much higher protection."
77,"Good thing you‚Äôre vaccinated, or the outcome could be much worse."
78,I think the same thing about kids being killed by gun violence in schools.
79,"If it happened and just once, the parents got together and demanded that everyone be able to SEE what happened to their children, there'd be a sea change virtually overnight when it comes to opinions on gun control."
80,"It's the exact reason Emmett Till's mother allowed her son to be photographed at his open casket funeral - she *wanted* the world to see what kind of sick, depraved, evil lived in ""the heart"" of America, and it was one of the things that ignited the civil rights movement."
81,I'm genuinely curious how this will work with our students.
82,So obviously the nurse has vaccination records but with covid not being required for public school I'm not sure how that will work compared to the required vaccinations.
83,The odds of two people you know getting myocarditis are astronomically high.
84,So high as to raise some skepticism about your post.
85,"Here are some statistics from the CDC: 

‚ÄúThe benefits (prevention of COVID-19 disease and associated hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and deaths) outweighed the risks (expected myocarditis cases after vaccination) in all populations for which vaccination has been recommended."
86,"However, the balance of benefits and risks varied by age and sex because cases of myocarditis were primarily identified among males aged &lt;30 years, and the risks of poor outcomes related to COVID-19 increase with age."
87,"Per million second doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine administered to males aged 12‚Äì29 years, 11,000 COVID-19 cases, 560 hospitalizations, 138 ICU admissions, and six deaths due to COVID-19 could be prevented, compared with 39‚Äì47 expected myocarditis cases after COVID-19 vaccination (Table 2)."
88,"Among males aged ‚â•30 years, 15,300 COVID-19 cases, 4,598 hospitalizations, 1,242 ICU admissions, and 700 deaths could be prevented, compared with three to four expected myocarditis cases after COVID-19 vaccination.‚Äù

89,Awesome.

104,"Not quite 

Here's some light reading about the effects of asymptomatic and mild/moderate cases."
105,It seems that there's a lot we're still discovering about the effects of Covid-19 and their duration.
106,Asymptomatic doesn't equal an absence of ill effects.
107,"‚ÄúThe researchers found elevations of C5b9 in patients with severe COVID-19 and MIS-C, but to their surprise, they also found that C5b9 was elevated in patients with minimal or asymptomatic disease."
108,"Of the 22 patients for whom complete data were available, 19 (86%) met the criteria for TMA [thrombotic microangiopathy]."
109,"Additionally, sC5b9 levels were elevated both in patients who did and did not meet criteria for TMA."
110,"Although most children with COVID-19 do not have severe disease, our study shows that there may be other effects of SARS-CoV-2 that are worthy of investigation.‚Äù

‚ÄúMethods: We retrospectively investigated patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 but who did not show any symptoms."
111,"Among the 139 patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized in Yeungnam University Hopistal in Daegu, South Korea, 10 (7.2%) were asymptomatic."
112,Their chest CT and radiographic findings were analyzed.
113,"Results: In the results, all patients (100%) had ground-glass opacity (GGO) on chest CT. Further, the GGO lesions were predominantly distributed peripherally and posteriorly in all patients."
114,"In 9 (90%) patients, the GGO lesions were combined with reticular opacity.‚Äù

115,Mild-moderate acute stage.

117,"Comparing seropositive vs seronegative participants, 26% vs 9% reported at least 1 moderate to severe symptom lasting for at least 2 months (RR, 2.9 [95% CI, 2.2-3.8]) and 15% vs 3% reported at least 1 moderate to severe symptom lasting for at least 8 months (RR, 4.4 [95% CI, 2.9-6.7]) (Table)."

127,A few teachers caught it but stayed out and one student caught it but only because his parents had it and he was quarantined at home with them.

404,"For symptomatic cases, the percentage is between 80-90% reduction (much more in line with England)"
405,No the rest of Australia won't fall the same way.
406,Australia is so large and cities spread out that covid won't spread to other states while lockdown is still occuring in Sydney.

415,"&gt; The vax is prevents hospitalization/serious illness

True, but even in Europe, they still have a 30-40% unvaccinated population."
416,"So the hospitals will still fill up, with the unvaccinated."
417,Do we let that happen and then start turning people away from hospitals?
418,I don't think anyone will stomach that.
419,Or do we lock down hard again when the hospitals are full yet again?

455,We have not done anything with her all year and thought with  vaccination rates pretty good in New England area and low positivity rates (under 1%) that an outdoor aquirium would be safe.
456,We would love if she would wear a mask but she hates it.
457,We just have done no activities where one would be remotely needed until this.
458,It was so much more crowded than we expected.
459,We waited until people cleared away from viewing spots and moved out if anyone walked close by.
460,We walked quickly and around folks with as much distance as possible.

515,"For better and for worse, those kind of images aren't very common anymore."
516,"Because of logistics, I doubt that we'll see videos of very many COVID patients struggling and dying in the ICU."
517,You would need the patient (and maybe family) to consent to a press/info release.
518,"The hospital would also need to be okay with it, and they would likely bounce that request to PR and legal teams who would likely discourage the idea due to HIPAA and liability exposure."
519,"Additionally, hospital systems and all trying to increase elective surgeries as much as possible to preserve hospital revenue, and a foreboding image of death in the ICU isn't going to encourage people to come to the hospital for their 100% elective surgery."

532,Even a big section of young people will inherit insane value in assets that aren't taxed (even the US has estate taxes for comparison) if their parents bought a modest home before 2010 in any capital city so most don't care as long as they get their slice of the pie.
533,"Take out compulsory voting and sausage sizzles at the polling booth, I'd be interested in seeing how much the polling % is."

709,I misunderstood what you meant too.
710,You could always edit it to be more clear.
711,"Why are people not paying attention to the spike in RSV cases in the US south and in NZ, indicating that there may be an immunity debt incurred due to having kids not going to school/daycare or being masked up all the time for a year?"
712,I keep seeing people on Twitter/Reddit obsessed about how kids still can‚Äôt get vaccinated and they don‚Äôt want to ‚Äútake a chance on unknown long term effects‚Äù when there is clear evidence that COVID does not impact children nearly as common as the general population and there are NOW outbreaks of RSV which can land kids in the hospital.
713,I just worry that we‚Äôre not thinking about how we‚Äôre not setting up our children to have a robust immune system by constantly protecting them :(
714,So you can't answer them because you don't know.
715,Makes sense

867,The antigen tests only show up as positive several days after infection and a few days after becoming infectious.
868,"yes, this is actually a good news because we know the combination of vaccine that can effectively beat the Delta variant.. though probably the second Sinovac injection and the AZ booster need to be spaced around 3 month to allow for affinity maturity..
  
and it's a pity there is no data about 3rd Sinovac injection, I'm very curious about that.."
869,One shot of a vaccine would give me way more confidence than someone unvaccinated havign a test just before.

934,Or the alternative of getting Covid!
935,I've wondered what would have happened if SARS and MERS had popped up in 2020?
936,They were contained by a robust organization that was dismantled just in time for the covid to run amok.
937,"They didn't say anything about the vaccines losing the ability to protect as some sort of fear mongering; many vaccines have loss of efficacy over time, which is why you get boosters."
938,"Tetantus every 10 years, yadda yadda."
939,"The concern they brought up is that if this shit stays at a constant 'pandemic' level threat for too long, that could overlap with a certain segment of the population's ""wane"" curve."
940,"It's a legitimate concern, albeit not one that will happen within the next 6 months to a year, if we're lucky."
941,"(Although, they were talking about boosters before the Delta Variant really kicked into gear, so.)"
942,"For the benefit of the doubt of those curious, the study shows number of Neutralizing antibodies produced after different combinations."
943,2 shots of sinovac combination yields good enough response but SV+SV+AZ really takes it up a notch by a LOT.
944,That's about it.
945,"No other data yet, maybe we'll have to wait for the actual paper to be peer reviewed then released."
946,"&amp;#x200B;

Thank you u/east_62687"
947,Nepal is in a dire situation as well.
948,We need loads of vaccines to all countries all over the world.
949,Not OP but same city.
950,It‚Äôs atrocious what‚Äôs happening with citizens overseas.
951,"However, while some genuinely couldn‚Äôt for life reasons (sick family, mortgage etc) leave, others that I knew rolled the dice and figured it would be over soon or not so bad to lose visas and come home despite the government advice to the contrary."
952,For those people I have less sympathy.
953,In May ages 65+ had 84% at least 1 dose and 71.9% fully vaccinated.
954,"Like the UK, the US focused early vaccination efforts on front line workers then the elderly, my parents were vaccinated in Feb."
955,But like with every age group it varies by the state.
956,The article that I can't link to because it contains politics compares fully vaccinated older adults in Utah 57.6% with Vermont 87%.
957,Are you saying people who enter clubs never leave them?
958,Or should high-risk ppl also avoid any areas that ppl who visited clubs went afterwards?
959,(like supermarkets)
960,This was a hospital company.
961,I was trying to agree that bars and clubs are not the issue.
962,I was implying virtually nobody in the NL is wearing masks anymore.
963,"But sure, drag it to another meaning and call it ridiculous for your upvotes"
964,"Considering Chicago is the third most populated city in the US, our situation could‚Äôve been a hell of a lot worse had we not had strict measures in place."
965,"So, as I stated previously, the state actually did take it pretty seriously."
966,A federal court has already upheld a vaccine mandate after employees were fired for refusing to be vaccinated.
967,No surprise that myself and every other person working in microbiology at a level 1 trauma center got vaccinated without much hesitancy.
968,"However, my fellow lab scientist in chemistry and heme are about 60/40 vaccinated."
969,It's different when you're forced to handle dozens upon dozens of sputum samples every single shift.
970,literally having to dig into a covid patients vent juice to find the chunky bits since that's where the secondary bacterial infection is hiding.
971,Do that a few thousand times and you want that fucking shot.
972,üòÇüòÇüòÇ this is my new slogan and should be the gov one

984,"""People like me"" think the end game is not eradication but prevention through mass vaccination."
985,We need to hit a target before we can even dream about fully opening.
986,It is there!
987,"It's not an artificial thing on the horizon anymore, the end is there!"
988,"people have appointments, we just have to wait until it's done!"
989,Good we really need to vaccinate everybody all over the world before we start talking about 3rd shots etc.
990,"I mean, they also expose people to *dying,* which is worse."

992,Update to be more effective against delta.
993,The mRNA vaccines are gone from your body in a day so there is absolutely no chance of cancer.
994,Thank you so much.
995,Any information is good enough for me!
996,I'd like to take a look!
997,Of course there were people dying all around the world but IMO closing border sooner would have prevented some deaths.
998,Looking for a treatment instead of only the vaccine would have prevented deaths as well.
999,And when I say sooner I means beginning of 2020 when we all knew something bad was coming.
1000,What do you mean abandoned in Denmark?
1001,The coronaapp is very much in use in Denmark right now.
1002,It‚Äôs not approved outside of emergency use yet.
1003,Just have a solid vaccination target and try to hit that.
1004,Why not keep masks and capacity rules until then?
1005,I don't understand
1006,Illinois is 18th in Covid cases and 16th in deaths per 100k.
1007,"So, did the state take it serious or did the measures not make a difference?"
1008,"This number will vary a lot with how easy access to free tests are, and the willingness to test."
1009,There are large differences from country to country
1010,[removed]
1011,"I understand not wanting to get the J&amp;J, though I would in a hard beat if that was my only choice."
1012,"But even for J, the chances of anything wrong are so incredibly low and conspiracy theories are pushing these worries."
1013,What‚Äôs for sure is that as long as you have COVID you cannot die from anything else
1014,[deleted]
1015,That's fucked up.

1019,As an Australian living overseas I expected nothing less.
1020,Luckily I have no intention of going back but my daughter won't get to meet her grandparents for years at this rate.
1021,It's home to some of the most selfish people I've encountered so far.

1025,They are hero‚Äôs until they don‚Äôt want the jab
1026,They are fudging the numbers again.
1027,"From the article...

&gt;The state has not provided any information as to when these &gt;deaths occurred."
1028,&gt;The state stopped reporting the number of non-residents who &gt;died in Florida with its new weekly reporting method.
1029,So if you die in Florida from Covid and you don't officially live there your not part of the count.
1030,Same shit different day.
1031,And of course WHEN people died of Covid doesn't really matter does it?
1032,/S
1033,Ugh.
1034,You're right.

1036,One of my good friends runs a daycare out of her house in LA county and she also has not had one COVID case amongst the kids or any staff.

1041,There's very little empathy for those outside a narrow worldview of what Australian life is supposed to be and it's frankly disheartening.
1042,[removed]
1043,This thing killed a lot of people when we were being careful.
1044,This variant is nasty and most people are walking around with no precautions.
1045,These places where the vax rates are low are going to get slammed.
1046,COVID vaccines aren‚Äôt on the required vaccination list.
1047,The sad truth is they probably won‚Äôt be until we see full authorization from the FDA that applies to kids under 12.
1048,Right now there isn‚Äôt even emergency authorization in the US for giving vaccines to kids under 12.
1049,"Even then, there are loopholes that accomadate anti-vax nutjob parents in many states that allow unvaccinated kids to still attend public schools."
1050,"Lol I know

Shitty but true"
1051,very true.

1060,IMO it should have been much higher priority.

1272,A lot of people think we are nearing the end but in reality I think it's still going to be a long battle with the virus continuing to mutate and new vaccine shots being developed.

1286,"60% vs infection is something I haven't seen before, but a certain percentage of those who do get infected will have a viral load low enough that they cannot pass on the virus and others will have a harder time transmitting the virus."
1287,I think everybody is underestimating delta.
1288,"We have been in a pandemic for over a year and we all kind of ""know"" what works, how the virus reacts."
1289,"But delta is different and what worked, what was reasonable last year is no longer."

1334,It‚Äôs a fact that less than three hundred cases out of 177 million and the inflammation is treatable therefore factually emphasizing that the benefits are greater than the risks.
1335,Many medications have risks that are weighed against the benefits.

it's not clear what the demo of the 3000+ new daily cases is but 50% vaccination is not a panacea clearly."
1347,Florida sits at around 48%.
1348,"Also your anecdotal evidence that you got covid and didn't have symptoms doesn't negate the fact that long-covid is affecting many young people, per the CDC, even though it's not killing them."

1554,"Overall administered doses are fairly constant at 500-550k/day, but new first doses are plummeting like a rock (down to about 100k/day)."

1556,"I certainly hope it's not because people have stopped signing up for it, since with first doses we're still barely at 70% of the adult population."
1557,There are a few scientists who agree with you on Twitter

1772,391 families in the US alone who have lost a child to covid might beg to differ that you don‚Äôt need to worry about kids.
1773,"Sure, it‚Äôs great if the adults are vaccinated."
1774,It‚Äôs great that kids are at lower risk of death.
1775,But kids can and do catch it from each other.
1776,I‚Äôm an elementary teacher and we dealt with a cluster among students at my school in March.
1777,"We know kids can develop long covid and can in rare cases die, and we know it‚Äôs perfectly possible to run successful classes with masks because we did it this year."
1778,So it‚Äôs a complete no brainer to just require masks until they can get vaccinated.
1779,My friend who got vaccinated with Pfizer now has COVID.
1780,But he‚Äôs doing well.
1781,No symptoms at all.
1782,We don‚Äôt but can still predict that the non vaccinated will contract the virus and die off in higher numbers than the vaccinated.
1783,So it‚Äôs still a win for science fact over the science deniers.
1784,If only we had a public list of all the deniers and could be able to run a bingo game of sorts.
1785,Also I‚Äôm fed up with trying to convince them.
1786,Now I have a default comment for majority of theirs.
1787,‚ÄúYou‚Äôve just been added to the list of people helping with the solution to climate change.
1788,Your name has been added to list of people willing to remove themselves from humanity‚Äôs gene pool.
1789,List will be shared hospital staff and would ease their minds and the strain on medical resources .
1790,Thank you for your service.‚Äù

1792,"You yourself said the vaccinated will be fine, it‚Äôs the unvaccinated that will have the problems."
1793,So with this scenario why should we still have a mask mandate.
1794,The vaccinated don‚Äôt need them and the unvaccinated adults weren‚Äôt wearing them to begin with.
1795,I would hope that parents with unvaccinated children wouldn‚Äôt need an official mandate to tell them to have their child wear a mask until they get their shot.
1796,So what would a mask mandate do?
1797,I moved back to Colorado after a four year tour in Texas a few months before the pandemic hit.
1798,Best decision I ever made.
1799,"Why dont you ask the people that are reporting this, on this post if they where part of the investigations done by these regelatory services."
1800,"If not, the number is under reported by default"
1801,"True, but I'll give my portion of Long Covid to somebody else."
1802,This is better than expected news.
1803,‚ÄúJust as much‚Äù sounds like a huge stretch.
1804,Have a reference?

1818,"It made me snort laugh and scare my cat, so‚Ä¶your attempt was successful!"
1819,"The same people saying ""these vaccines haven't been tested enough yet"" (despite there being over a billion vaccinated people now) will say COVID is ""just like the flu"" when long COVID...hasn't been tested enough yet."
1820,"No, J&amp;J is supposed to have 70% efficacy against severe covid, and that‚Äôs regular covid not the delta."
1821,It‚Äôs a shit vaccine really I don‚Äôt get why it counts as being vaccinated.
1822,&gt;‚ÄúMost‚Äù people in the US are fully vaccinated‚Ä¶.
1823,"Over half the country is fully vaccinated

Not quite."
1824,"I'm having trouble finding a non-paywalled article to link, but according to Google, 47.7% of Americans are fully vaccinated as of two days ago."
1825,"For Fosun it‚Äôs the same, but the X billion $ goes to BionTech and not Pfizer."
1826,:(
1827,Why Florida?
1828,Florida and Illinois are very close in vaccination rate but nobody brings up Illinois.
1829,Maybe it‚Äôs time to acknowledge that not all unvaccinated people are caricatures of Trump idiots

1862,Most of the people I know are talking about how they still don't feel safe in large crowds and don't think this is offer because we can't get everyone vaccinated.
1863,"They speak about not wanting to return to work in the office because they don't trust others to be vaccinated, without realizing that the vaccine should protect them regardless."

1890,"We shouldn‚Äôt disregard the data, but we also should give it appropriate weight in the risk-benefit analysis."
1891,Me personally?
1892,I think this is an important consideration and I acknowledge that this increases the risk associated with taking the vaccine.
1893,I also think that the benefits from receiving the vaccine are not even close to being eclipsed by the potential risks given their severity and frequency in the general population.
1894,My worry is that there are people who are less informed than I am who are on the fence about getting the vaccine and use this data as the excuse to avoid it without fully understanding the true risk.
1895,"It‚Äôs my belief that the only path forward in managing this virus is through mass vaccination, so we need to proceed in a cooperative manner, meaning as many people as people need to get on board."

2030,I figured the effects of covid would be worse that over vaccinating.
2031,A huge issue with the delta variant too is the change in symptoms.
2032,"Here in the UK we're finding that the most prominent symptoms are now - a sore throat, a runny nose and headache."

2037,Yep.
2038,"If the human body indefinitely kept producing antibodies for every virus it ever encountered, then the average human's blood would probably be a sludge by the time they hit age 20."
2039,So after an infection is cleared the body winds down production of the antibody for that infection.
2040,"For long term (potentially lifetime) immunity to a pathogen, the human body creates [Memory B Cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_B_cell) to remember that pathogen and allow the immune system to rapidly respond to reinfection."

2046,And the tragic part is that it‚Äôs all so preventable.
2047,"If there‚Äôs any silver lining, it‚Äôs that senior tend to be the most vaccinated demographic, so the case fatality rate should be a good deal lower than previous waves."
2048,But still‚Ä¶ not great
2049,"&gt; The EMA says, after 177 million total Pfizer doses were given out, 283 inflammation cases were reported."
2050,"&gt; And after 20 million Moderna doses, 38 inflammation cases were reported."

2096,My hope is still that deaths and hospitalisations *DO NOT* rise in the same way.
2097,"For some reason since the second wave, the Dutch always reported significantly less deaths and hospitalisations compared for the number of cases it had, compared to other countries."
2098,This has become even more extreme since the last wave of cases with a partially vaccinated population.
2099,"Hopefully this stays the case, as a lot more people are vaccinated now (81% of adults partially and 50% fully vaccinated)."
2100,"Last wave the peak of cases was ~10,000 and deaths ~20 per day."
2101,"Currently we are at 10,000 cases and ~1 death per day."
2102,"But deaths always lag cases, and the peak of cases will be much higher now due to less measures and the new variant being much more contagious."

2284,I disagree...
2285,The semantics of the origins of the virus just still don't add up....

2287,It's literally a city.
2288,"Also, a lot of publications keep repeating this falsehood that the Huannan market sold wild animals."
2289,"They did not.. they sold mostly seafood, it's literally a wet market."
2290,Aquatic animals don't even have the ACE2 receptor and none of them tested positive for the virus at the time.
2291,Or the fact that it was winter in China in November 2019.
2292,There's so many other reasons that this reasoning doesn't work.
2293,Because other viruses emerged zoonotically meaning that this one has to have done so  is also a very straw man argument to make.
2294,It is possible that it emerged naturally but this particular reasoning/timeline and explanation is bollocks.

2634,"First, you are going to have kids who have seen Trump and other influencers running around without masks who'll question why do they need to wear masks or get vaccinated (ignoring the fact that Trump got very, very sick from COVID-19 because he refused to wear a mask, plus later he very quietly got vaccinated)."
2635,"Second, you'll have two groups of students, masked and unmasked, with the masked students basically signaling to everyone their parents are anti-vax, anti-mask very likely strongly conservatives."
2636,Or more likely you'll have a large cohort of unvaxxed students also refusing to wear masks.
2637,Which will guarantee lots of schools will be the sources of COVID-19 outbreaks in the Fall.

2640,This is the dumbest spin I've ever heard and I've been on Reddit for years.
2641,Not getting vaccinated is unethical.

2643,"Sure, it might not have been the wisest of decisions to lift restrictions in a situation like this."
2644,"But aren't people capable of thinking by themselves, assess the situation rationally, and take (or avoid taking) action accordingly?"
2645,Just because a government lifts restrictions doesn't mean you have to act as if this pandemic suddenly was over.
2646,"In fact, you shouldn't, and all you need to come to this conclusion is some common sense."
2647,"So IMHO people should start taking some personal responsibility, this would help way more than anything the government does."
2648,"&gt; The risk to holidays has not been a factor in the decision to bring back some restrictions, he said, adding that he hoped that other EU countries would look at hospital admissions rather than infection rates when deciding if the Dutch should face quarantine or extra tests."
2649,Why the hell should hospital numbers in the Netherlands matter for other countries?
2650,The super ill people in the hospitals won't travel to other countries.
2651,They won't infect people outside the Netherlands.
2652,People with Covid and no or mild symptoms who don't stay at home are the bigger risk.

2654,How much testing?
2655,Nepal is where Delta and Delta+ dominates.
2656,I just don't think J&amp;J will do the trick.
2657,"Most hospitals where overwelmed by sanity rules and forced isolations (of both personel and patients) in the first place, not by shear numbers of patients"
2658,&gt; The vax is prevents hospitalization/serious illness in 93-97% of infections.
2659,That's not how efficacy against serious illness is calculated.
2660,"It's based on total reduction vs. an unvaccinated group, so the protection against infection is a significant part of that."

2662,"And of course there are still a lot of unvaccinated people who are just as susceptible to severe disease as they ever were, and they take up hospital beds just like anyone else."
2663,Because we actually will be providing education to children again

2673,Of course one of the big worries of the whole pandemic has been how long immunity lasts in general.
2674,"We haven't seen a lot of serious reinfections that we know of, but it's still early."

2699,"After my second, I got real tired about 4 hours in, slept for 8 hours, and woke up with flu like symptoms that lasted about 36 hours."

2715,He's on the zero covid moron train
2716,I thought most of the flu vaccine allergies were due to it being cultured in egg proteins.
2717,"I could have sworn I read something on this sub months ago that suggested allergies to the mRNA vaccines were far more rare and there was no common contraindications (egg allergies are fairly common, i.e."
2718,there were uncommon ones).
2719,From what I've read the most common reason to not be vaccinated is actually that it simply is not expected to work (i.e.
2720,"on chemo, certain immunosuppresents) and there is concern that a partial reaction could be worse."
2721,Just like that the end of the pandemic in the Netherlands had been officially willfully postponed at least 2 months by the government
2722,Everyone should have  a right to decide what is done to their own body.
2723,That's inviolable to me.
2724,However others also have a right to expect reasonable protection against unvaccinated people.
2725,At least you still got some protection.
2726,It would have been more serious without it
2727,What‚Äôs this now?
2728,Why is it called a dissent pin if you‚Äôre doing what you‚Äôre supposed to do (getting vaccinated)?
2729,Or am I misunderstanding?
2730,"I don't want to single you out and I agree with most of what you said, but what makes people on this sub think that Vietnam is more honest than China about the size of the outbreak there?"
2731,"Is it some kind of ""plucky underdog"" reputation?"
2732,It's a one-party state and is ranked 175th of 180 for press freedom (only two places higher than China).
2733,"It's been interesting to see that since the start of the pandemic, this sub has been incredibly sceptical of Russian statistics, fairy sceptical of Chinese statistics (although there's definite pro-China astroturfing), but almost universally trusting of Vietnam's statistics, which are actually the most implausible of the three."
2734,"In the early days, there were also some pretty hilarious comparisons to the Vietnam war."
2735,"The good news is, number of hospitalized people is still (for now, remind me in 2 weeks) going down."
2736,"Also good to note is, more than 2 times the number of tests where done, and the number of cases didnt double."
2737,So the average of positive case per test still went down
2738,"I said ""But that's a completely different topic that this section wasn't about""...

nvm, :wave:"
2739,My county is legitimately one of the best in the country in terms of vaccinations with 80% of adults having at least one dose.
2740,"Our cases have quadrupled in the last 10 days, with the last week showing a decent increase in percentage."
2741,"Does this mean we're now at like 2,000 cases a day?"
2742,"No, it went from 17 to 68."
2743,"BUT, the fact that we were seeing 0.3% positivity rate and now it's back up to 1%+ is really annoying and a bit concerning as it means this shit is way more out there than we assume."
2744,"My hope was always ""Get the cases to be so minimal that if anything bad happened, it would take time for things to get crazy."""
2745,"Well we got close but never really hit that, and now this variant is gonna make things have to be way more cautious."
2746,It's spreading like this even in countries with some of the best vaccination rates in the world.
2747,"It's just an absolute bugger of a variant and will find its way through any unvaccinated or single dose vaccinated crack it can, whether that's children or young, low risk people who haven't got their turn or gotten around to it yet, or genuine anti vax people."
2748,"Once levels got very high here in the UK we even started hearing more stories of double vaxxed people testing positive--the vaccines are excellent and most breakthrough cases seem to have low or no symptoms, but if even 5% or 10% of people can still catch it after vaccination, and covid is EVERYWHERE, that's going to amount to a fair few."
2749,"But if you look at the UK stats, the death rate is MASSIVELY lower than it would have been without the vaccines (last time the case rate 7 day average was where it is now and rising we were getting 30-40 0 deaths a day, and right now we're getting a tenth of that)."
2750,"States that have good vaccination rates will still see delta take over as the primary variant and may see temporary case spikes, but I'm confident those states won't have anything they can't cope with."
2751,"I'm much more worried about areas that do have low rates, though."
2752,This one must spread like *wildfire* in a low vax population.

2756,Nobody here has used the term ‚Äúscientific consensus‚Äù except for you.

2758,The random dentist from Kansas who doesn‚Äôt like vaccines doesnt affect that.
2759,"But, again, all I said was that dentists and therapists are not considered virology experts...because they‚Äôre not."
2760,This is what I‚Äôm thinking as well.
2761,I would‚Äôve been fired for not getting the flu vaccine every year.

2779,This is only true if the people who don't get vaccinated also don't catch the virus and get immunity the old-fashioned way.

2864,"Of these, 12.3m have been distributed to clinics for use, and 620,000 doses of AstraZeneca have been sent to Timor-Leste and Pacific nations."
2865,The health department says 2.3m doses of AstraZeneca are held in contingency to cover second dose allocations.
2866,"That leaves 1.4m doses which are presumably about to be distributed."""
2867,"Based on the number of vaccines administered to date and the size of its population, Australia has enough vaccine *right now* to give one shot to its entire adult population (my very rough calculations is that there are about 18-19 million adult Australians)."

3005,"The CDC's new guidelines about the new school year seem reasonable enough:  if you're fully vaccinated, you don't need to wear a mask."
3006,"If you aren't, then you should."
3007,"Even better, it sounds like such restrictions may gradually be loosened as more and more kids get vaccinated."
3008,"Given that the vaccine for kids is likely to be ready by September or so, it should only be several months in the fall until that restriction finally disappears."
3009,I think that's fair.
3010,I know probably close to a hundred young man who have been vaccinated with no issue.
3011,It‚Äôs up to you but the risk is not high enough to risk catching Delta which is probably just as likely to cause heart issue.
3012,One dose is not very effective at stopping the delta variant.
3013,That‚Äôs a very interesting statement since the CDC stopped tracking breakthrough cases how exactly can you/we demonstrate that to be true?
3014,They fucked around.
3015,They found out.

3286,I wish I could.
3287,I came back home due to a disability when I had my kid.
3288,I'm getting better but it's still a long ways off moving out of this moron fest.
3289,I can tell a lot of people commenting haven't lived in rural areas.
3290,It's not like you can just pick a different dentist or therapist.
3291,Most of the doctors around here spew that same crap too.
3292,The majority of the people here are that stupid.
3293,They can still do their jobs as competent as they come around here but switching is pointless and going without healthcare because it's not ideal isn't very smart.
3294,If we go by polls that means there's at least 28 million people in the US not willing to get vaccinated for whatever reason and the Delta Variant is now the most transmissible and the deadliest Variant out there according to recent research comparing each different versions Covid 19.. longer this goes on likely hood of a worse Variant then Delta is highly probable and the bigger scare is that it becomes immune to the present vaccines requiring those of already vaxxed to get  booster shots or a new vaccine.
3295,Pfizer today said they're making a new vaccine based on the Delta Variant now that's something new.. so what did they see in the sequencing that got them to work on a new vaccine?
3296,"The problem is the sick pay is an earned and guaranteed benefit, aside from the COVID sick pay which was a bonus if it was suspected if you got it from a patient."

3306,"Your last sentences contradict your earlier statements, and those final thoughts are actually the correct ones."
3307,"Now, as vaccination rates are still too low the strategy is to keep infections down."
3308,The experts and models are speaking a clear language.
3309,It is essential to get vaccinations fast now.
3310,A 10% difference is huge as RKI calculations showed this week.
3311,"A vaccination rate of 65% in the 12-59 (we're at 41% atm in all age groups, in the 12-59 actually lower) would produce incidence of 400 and ICU beds of 6.000 whilst a rate of 75% ""only"" incidence of 150 and 2.000 beds."
3312,"High infection rates now only hurt us, means just more deaths and sick people."
3313,Johnson is unfit to hold any political power.
3314,Same for me with Pfizer - zero side effects.
3315,"It actually made me worry ""Is it not working?!"""
3316,Yes please.
3317,It is clear herd immunity hasn't kicked in yet.
3318,Or just stop British people from flying abroad.
3319,Everyday I turn on the news and see that my country is getting covid cases from incoming British flights.
3320,We only have 5% vaccination rate and it is unfair that we are all suffering because British people still don't know how to not get sick even after a year of being paid by their government to not get sick.
3321,Nothing about the tens of thousands of paramedics and nurses though?
3322,The one that's mostly lacked access to vaccines until recently.
3323,What does this mean for schools and colleges in LA County?
3324,Will they still open up?
3325,"I‚Äôve heard many of the colleges ‚Äúplan‚Äù for a full return but that nothing is certain, and that in any case, there could be some mitigations to a full-return plan"
3326,Is everyone wearing masks?
3327,It will help.
3328,Apparently it's actually not as bad against delta as originally feared.
3329,I've asked for proof.
3330,"Governments shouldn‚Äôt have to enforce seatbelt laws for people in cars, because we *should* all be smart enough to use them."

3334,Not good enough.
3335,He's been in the US ages.
3336,Could've been double vaxxed if he wasn't stupid.
3337,I say this as a huge fan of his.
3338,I work at a not so rural hospital in Alabama but same.
3339,I‚Äôm the only vaccinated person on the EVS OR team.
3340,Total bullshit.
3341,Or unvaccinated people only get tested when then have to go to the hospital.
3342,Which while rarer would appear more prevalent.
3343,I think it's impossible to tell right now.
3344,Everyone 18 and up has been able to get vaccinated since March 31st.
3345,So they‚Äôve had nearly 3.5 months now.
3346,"
&gt;Slash-and-burn agriculture and crop rotation were known to Europe for a long time."
3347,Slash and burn was very uncommon outside very small pockets of mesoamerica.
3348,crop rotation wasn't known in Europe so much as it was known that certain fields needed to be left fallow for a year or so while weed crops we're grown.
3349,"Native Americans grew beans in those fields instead, keeping them productive while fixing nitrogen better than cover would've."
3350,"They also had the ""three sisters"" method of planting where corn, beans and squash were grown side by side as permaculture, which kept the soil productive while still providing a complete diet."
3351,"&gt; Europe had better understanding of fertilizing, used animal force for handling the land, 

They used animals that North America didn't have, and fertilized with their feces."
3352,"&gt;used three-fields system that NA (to the best of my knowledge) never had, 

They didn't need it."
3353,"&gt;introduced cover crops (100-200 years before Columbus) 

North Americans were using cover crops before Europeans showed up."
3354,"We don't know for sure how long before, but it was before."
3355,"&gt;and survived on less productive cultures (maize is **still** more productive than wheat, there's no Indian magic in it; so is potato)."
3356,There's no Indian magic?
3357,Do you know anything about what you're saying?
3358,"Wild corn is garbage, it's the little stupid corn things you get in your Chinese food."
3359,"The corn you actually eat was bred by native Americans to be worthwhile, and the really productive varieties need to be processed using chemicals and sophisticated methods that the ""primitive"" native Americans figured out before even the Mayans developed written language."
3360,Potatoes were straight up poison before native Americans fixed them.
3361,&gt;Europe didn't know domesticated plants?
3362,"Hm, good to know... Oh, wait!"
3363,"Wheat, oats, barley, rye, turnip... Again, happens since Neolithic, doesn't need any knowledge Europe didn't have."
3364,"Wild and/or ancestral wheats such as bulgar, spelt, farro and others are perfectly edible and are sold in the wheat aisle of your grocery store."
3365,"They're slightly less productive than mainstream varieties, but they're more flavorful and tend to be more disease resistant."
3366,"&gt;They had houses and boats, so they did it."
3367,But they were waaaay behind.
3368,Houses and boats were not particularly important to them.
3369,"When they were, they did amazing things, but for the most part they didn't build permanent structures and they didn't need boats to go beyond a couple miles from shore."
3370,"&gt;Recurring appearance of various forms of a germ theory since Ancient Greece, including books on the matter."
3371,"Miazma theory dominated the landscape, but Europe at least **had** the root of the modern understanding of disease."
3372,No such thing for prehistoric NA.
3373,"&gt;Mondino de Luzzi, Anatomia corporis humani, 1316."
3374,Did any European in north America know any of that shit?
3375,Did any doctor in most major cities?
3376,"They were bounced between academics and philosophers, but were incredibly obscure."
3377,&gt;Except the wide-spread folk medicine and monasteries copying ancient books on herbalism and keeping gardens to grow said herbs to use in medical treatments (that's why wounded medieval kings ended up there).
3378,Both survived to our days.
3379,"Would you rather be treated by a 17th century medieval barber, or a 17th century native American herbalist?"
3380,"Because sure, herbalism was understood by some in Europe, but weren't practiced by many because those who practiced it were *often burned as witches*."
3381,Medicine was kept down for centuries in Europe by classism and Christianity.
3382,"It should've been better, but it wasn't."
3383,"Actually, I'm 16 and my parents let me get vaccinated."
3384,Sounds like they need to work on increased vaccinations then.
3385,I think we may be looking for those answers for years to come.
3386,1 year booster?
3387,5 year?
3388,New variants?
3389,"Which would be fine if science doing what it does, changing, evolving, didn't get used as an excuse to discount it entirely."
3390,And to your point about how much we care about mild covid in vaccinated people...good thought.
3391,I could live with mild flu level covid.
3392,The problem within the US is that lots of places have 70% of their population willfully (mostly) unprotected and at risk of serious illness and death.
3393,"And the rest of the world where widespread vaccination could take years, new variants emerge, new shots needed, ad nauseam."
3394,"This actually not true, here in germany, its the same as in other european countries:

The underlying problem is too quick, too unreasonable openings."
3395,"Dropping the mask mandate inside, in schools, totally neglecting the most unvaccinated group, artificially delaying hepa filters in schools, dropping the need to test, no controls whatsoever...

North Rhine-Westphalia jumping ahead (ofc) with opening all remaining restrictions in areas like sport, night clubs, festivals, no more distancing, no condact data (as if it was done before), no more restrictions of customers per area."
3396,All whilst our numbers are going up again.
3397,"So, the underlying problem is the same: they want too much too quick and then risk it all."
3398,The dutch are just ahead a couple few weeks.
3399,"It was one of our head experts own words, Wieler, President of RKI that we wont stop the upcoming autumn wave with vaccinations alone."
3400,Such a bad generalised article.
3401,Many parts of Australia have lived a normal day to day life and will continue until we are all vaccinated.
3402,Sure here in Brisbane we have had a few short sharp lockdowns since the large one large year where most of the world was locked down.
3403,But since then we have had it quite okay.
3404,"In many other parts of Australia, they have lived a normal life without any lockdowns or restrictions."
3405,[removed]
3406,[removed]
3407,The vaccine helps against severe sickness.
3408,The areas currently seeing a surge are in those with low vaccination rates.
3409,"Yes they work, they have good protection against the Delta variant."
3410,"The problem is unvaccinated folks are keeping the virus around for longer than it should have, which becomes a concern when vaccinated people's protections start to wane and they become vulnerable."
3411,Stagnant.
3412,"But since cases were on the lower end of the spectrum, this spike wouldn't cause anything major yet anyway."
3413,I need to look for next week.
3414,"The fact is though, my county is VERY vaccinated and still is seeing an increase in cases."
3415,That should be concerning for everyone.
3416,Yes thank you!
3417,Now everyone go get the vaccine!
3418,[deleted]
3419,&gt;it would take time for things to get crazy.
3420,But what are the hospital numbers looking like?
3421,"We didn't do stay at home and lockdowns simply because of cases, we did it to stop hospitals from being overrun."
3422,"If you're in an area with very high numbers of vaccination, its unlikely that hospitalization numbers will come anywhere near to the highs we saw last year."
3423,"The areas with high numbers of unvaccinated, those are the ones that are going to have real problems."
3424,The irony is that they tend to be chockful of people who complained about COVID restrictions the most but have also been refusing to do the one thing that would essentially guarantee not having to return to those same restrictions.
3425,you sound like someone who drank the q coolaid.
3426,"I‚Äôm fully vaccinated, I think my sister who has refused to get vaccinated might have COVID."
3427,Should I be worried?
3428,"Again, you're wrong."
3429,Which generation is that?
3430,It definitely isn't.
3431,Good luck for a speedy recovery.
3432,What symptoms did you have beyond the heart rate to get tested?
3433,And this is after the vaccine is available to everyone!
3434,I'd suggest getting out of Kansas.
3435,I was born and raised there and never really took vacations or anything.
3436,"Well, I made a sudden and I guess spontaneous decision with my wife and toddler to just move."
3437,4 months I've been out of there and it's just been an absolute blessing!
3438,P.S.
3439,Everyone I know here in my new state (AR) is vaccinated too!
3440,"Yeah, I think Wallensky will turn out to be one of the villains of the piece when we look back a year or two from now."
3441,"After a year of struggle, we had made good strides on establishing new social norms in the US about wearing masks, operating businesses at less than full capacity, and shutting down certain dangerous venues."
3442,"It was not perfect by any means, but tremendous progress had been made, which kept a lot of people alive."
3443,She basically pissed that away in about a week.
3444,Now everyone is strutting around saying they will never wear a mask again and going on cruises and into bars.
3445,Really tragic and lame.
3446,Geez.
3447,I assume you are looking for a new therapist for no them‚Ä¶
3448,"This is exactly what's going to happen with the delta variant all over, and yet these idiots refuse to get vaccinated, worried about side effects, and refuse to wear masks"
3449,Only in those areas where vaccination rates are 60% or higher.
3450,Experts estimate that only 50% of LA county as a whole is full vaccinated.
3451,So there are millions out there living life like it was pre-pandemic and are spreading it around.
3452,"There are more and more breakthrough cases, but it's not a real concern at this time as very few of those end up with severe symptoms."
3453,Hahaha!
3454,And I want a personal scanner so I can ping people and check.
3455,I live in the South.

3496,That's a fair point to raise.
3497,But the US being more successful wouldn't hurt.
3498,It would free us up to provide more aid abroad.
3499,Of course not.

3502,"Maybe social media is not even popular there, I don't know."
3503,I know that it sounds a lot like what's happening in the US with the 5G and Bill Gates crap.
3504,I think social media plays a big role in spreading misinformation.
3505,There are people that would love for that scenario to happen because it would mean they were right and all the people who called them stupid will be dead.
3506,Cuba is very serious about medicine and science.
3507,They have [14 med schools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_medical_schools_in_the_Caribbean) and came up with [a cancer vaccine](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/video/cancer-vaccine-cuba/) that is undergoing trials in the US.

3510,The government told me to do it so I won't do it!
3511,_Proceeds to drive through red light_
3512,Going door-to-door in rural Missouri to tell people to get vaccinated is not a job you could pay me enough to do.
3513,"(This is being considered, it is yet to be enforced) If it were implemented, I assume it would be abandoned like Israel‚Äôs and Denmark‚Äôs passes."
3514,It would be highly enforced for a week or two but would quickly taper off.
3515,With such a high vaccination percentage most businesses would eventually assume their patrons were vaccinated anyway.
3516,I think they wanted to do this for large venues and hospitality earlier in the year but they refused so they gave up.
3517,I just don‚Äôt see domestic passports being useful for anything other than international travel.
3518,Why are people acting like delta is a threat to vaccinated people?
3519,[removed]
3520,What
3521,Just sad.
3522,There‚Äôs also no federal guidance that the government has the authority to make vaccines mandatory for all.

3541,"In the bigger picture, COVID is highly survivable."
3542,"What should worry everyone is what future, more deadly virus they might disregard."
3543,We could very well have future leaders and millions of people who do not take something like that seriously and who do not react appropriately to something much more dangerous.
3544,Now they want to pass that kind of thinking through educational institutions.
3545,"My big hope is that COVID is remembered and is treated as a lesson, but this kind of stuff shows me that we'll probably repeat history and it could be much, much worse next time."

3564,But mRNA has been used in plenty of shots prior to COVID.
3565,It's just that COVID made it worthwhile to spend R&amp;D on the technology and improve/streamline it.

3567,Its having a big impact on young people too.
3568,Lots of under 40s in hospital and intensive care (vax not available for under 40s yet).
3569,It will get worse before it gets better for us as we only have 8% or 9% fully vaxed and 25% - 30% with one shot due to our Federal govt being very slow with the Pfizer roll out and lack of trust in AZ.

3576,Same as alberta.
3577,But don't underestimate Europeans traveling.
3578,That and the stupid green checkmark policies that basically gives you no reason to vaccinate.
3579,Netherlands really needs to stop pretending they know better than everyone else.
3580,Mate this virus has been in oz since March 2020 and our govt has issued repeated warnings then to come home or you might be locked out.
3581,"It's been fucken 1.5 years since then and we still have flights into the country, if you still ain't coming back then that's on you"

3590,"Hmm, maybe that's how we might get the rest of the people vaccinated..."
3591,"Roughly speaking, what‚Äôs the probability of testing positive for COVID 48 hours after exposure?"
3592,Idk.
3593,My GFs hospital just made vaccines mandatory this week and in the email they say point blank you will be terminated if you do not comply.
3594,Any exceptions need to be reviewed by a board with doctors.
3595,They still lose to The University of The Michigan
3596,"We have all kinds of laws that protect the common good, time to make vaccinations mandatory for the common good."
3597,Cowards can find their courage behind bars if they need to.
3598,At this point it's sheer cowardice not to get vaccinated there is more than enough data to make an educated decision.
3599,"Once the pandemic is over, no more mandatory vaccination law."
3600,I have HIV and COPD and belive me I understand worry about vaccinations but I did it because it's not just me that is important here.
3601,"What the individual does effects countless others and on something like this it effects even those not yet born so time to grow some balls, face your enemy and stop makeing excuses."
3602,"If the vaccination kills me in years to come, but stops the pandemic then it's a noble sacrifice to make for the sake of our youth and their children to come."
3603,Don't let them inherit this.
3604,"We are at this point due to the failures of those who were supposed to lead and protect us, let's do better than that for those we are supposed to lead and protect."
3605,Get it done.
3606,Ya and you don't know how to read or how vaccine testing works lol fucking typical covid denial bull shit
3607,Takeaway: monopolizing is bad
3608,"The person I responded to was saying the vaccines prevented hospitalization in 93-97% of **infections**, which isn't correct."
3609,The 93-97% reduction (and any efficacy against hospitalization that is discussed) is *before* accounting for infections.
3610,"So if you had a group of unvaccinated people that had 10K infections and 500 hospitalizations, and then an identical group that was vaccinated with a vaccine that's 90% effective and 95% effective against hospitalization, you would expect 1K infections and 25 hospitalizations in the latter group."
3611,"So a 95% reduction in hospitalization, but once you look at just people who were infected, the rate of hospitalization per case would only drop by half (2.5% in vaccinated vs 5% in unvaccinated)."
3612,"I know there are ethical issues involved with vaccine passports and vaccine mandates, but there are also huge ethical issues with massive restrictions on everybody, which appears to be the likeliest alternative."
3613,"The survival of live entertainment is crucial; it's not a minor part of life, and if they know they can be shut down again any time cases start to rise beyond a certain level, they can't survive."

3615,Really it's not a bad idea ü§£
3616,[deleted]
3617,Guess I'll be saving alot of money then!
3618,It's no business' business to know my vaccination status and that I've had my doses.
3619,"People will surely be up in arms they are doing that kinda thing, but those people have been aiding this pandemic for too long."
3620,"Like, you can claim it's ""your right/choice"" to not get vaccinated, but everyone else should be able to keep them as far away from crowds as possible."
3621,US venues should be doing this too.
3622,"There‚Äôs no proof it‚Äôs inferior, it actually seems to be holding better against the variants"
3623,For real!

3631,Yeah.
3632,It's a hospital.
3633,The last thing you wanna do is get the people you're treating even more sick.

3639,I‚Äôm pretty sure that at the federal level there‚Äôs nothing that says you have to exempt people based on religion.
3640,There‚Äôs actually 6 states that do not grant religious exemptions to their vaccination laws that are already on the books.

3786,We are also one of 20 states to hit 70% or partially vaccinated adults before July 4.
3787,We are far from perfect but most people I know actually believed the virus was real and dangerous and acted accordingly in following the guidelines.

3838,They‚Äôve been saying it since the beginning.

3840,I‚Äôd bet way more people have erection issues due to being fat than covid.

3844,I'm shocked at their stupidity.
3845,"And even in that case, there is no guarantee that this wave will give immunity to protect against a new wave of a new variant."
3846,Vaccination gives seemingly better immunity and at least this closure gives every adult the time to get fully vaccinated.
3847,"The closure is until the 14th of August, this is not a random date - it is the date you will be fully vaccinated if you sign up for your first dose today."
3848,(Same day first doses are starting to be available many locations in the Netherlands)

3854,The Delta variation seems to mostly be going after unvaccinated older people and middle aged unvaccinated people.
3855,Someone I went to high school with in the 90s (so he's 45 like me) is seriously ill in hospital for instance.
3856,I'm so sorry about your friends.

3859,"Yes they missed social interactions, but they learned more this year than years past."
3860,The school was focused too and did an excellent job.
3861,The kids got together weekly without teachers too and really had fun together.
3862,I think a ton of people underestimate how resilient children are.
3863,The biggest problem with remote learning is that some children don't have great situations at home.
3864,The US is doing the same thing.
3865,"We‚Äôre not devoting enough resources to vaccinate people, monitor the disease, or respond to outbreaks, so the fallback by politicians will always be ‚Äúpersonal responsibility.‚Äù"
3866,I heard that they will obtain BNT technology transfer and produce BNT after August.
3867,This is the real issue.
3868,Getting tested in the US is harder and harder as there are less locations further apart.
3869,They also actively discourage vaccinated people from getting tested to keep the numbers down since the beginning of the year.
3870,"Good for politics, not good for seeing what the spread looks like."
3871,At this point testing should be everywhere and quick turnaround.
3872,Every approved vaccine is effective.
3873,There is still a very finite number of vaccine doses worldwide and the supply is no where close to a point where we can be extremely choosy about brand of vaccine.
3874,"The J&amp;J vaccine is millions of times better than the alternative, which is no vaccine."

3885,How can he justify his stance.
3886,It doesn‚Äôt make any sense.
3887,China went for the full lockdown and zero cases strategy so they can't run trials domestically to find out.
3888,They have to depend on partner countries that have delta outbreaks to be transparent and help run trials.
3889,"They planned it to happen in the sense that most of these measures are intended to socially construct an end of the pandemic, even if that ending is not rooted in reality whatsoever."

3903,Indeed.

3937,I have to figure we hit a peak period of vaccines + people immune from being sick.
3938,"However, the immunity (from being sick) is wearing off and Delta is wrecking havoc now since it spreads so easily."
3939,So it's probably round 2 for a lot of those not vaccinated (but had immunity).
3940,Also mask mandate probably helped keep it slower for some time.
3941,Vaccines definitely help though.

3953,The people making everyone else wear the masks never wear them.
3954,"I dont comprehend why the push to drop mask wearing is here, sure make it not a legal requirement but we should still be strongly recommended, unless data suggests makes no difference for delta varient 'possible?'"
3955,"surely the more people who wear them, the less peak pressure on the nhs the next few months."
3956,Only logical reason I can think is that government is planning to use natural infection like a booster shot to infect as many people as possible before winter arrives reguardless of the consequences short term as the only way to get through winter without locking down.
3957,"There‚Äôs a Kaiser Health study showing ~1/3 of unvaxxed Hispanics are  extremely interested in getting vaccinated but are worried about immigration status, unpaid time off of work for side effects, and time to travel to vaccination site combines with child care."

3969,The government is doing fine here.
3970,It‚Äôs the dumbass party that is screwing things up.
3971,Some terrible ‚Äúleaders‚Äù politicized a public health crisis and now people refuse to get vaccinated.

3977,"I assume you're in the US or maybe UK, where you are actually allowed to try and influence your politicians."

4042,"Regardless if you want any vaccine (covid or not), pharmacists still have to make a determination if it's medically beneficial or not or risk losing job/license."
4043,"Right now, CDC is saying a booster is not recommended so they cannot give one out even if you beg and give them a $1000."
4044,But they don't as the group of people that would end up in the hospital already is vaccinated.
4045,As we can see by the hospitalisations to the IC.
4046,Which is still 0.
4047,Vaccines don't stop infections.
4048,"And this lockdown already drives the younger generation bonkers, mark my words most likely illegal raves and festivals and parties are going to pop up because of this."
4049,I would agree if there were any hospitalisations but there aren't any because of the vaccines.
4050,Infections are always going to be there because vaccines don't stop them.
4051,Not to mention the extra testing is very much correlated with the extra infections and could definitely have something to do with the stark increase without the increase in hospitalisations.
4052,When you people get covid and don't have any symptoms they would go unnoticed but now they are forced to so they are suddenly added to the pool.
4053,Time will tell I guess but this seems pointless to me.
4054,Eventually we'll have to let go of infections and just monitor hospitalisations.
4055,That's the point of the vaccine.
4056,I've come across multiple commenters already on this subreddit asking if it's illegal for them to get a third dose if they lie to a pharmacist because they're scared reading these headlines and heading back to work/school soon.
4057,"They will do similar in North Rhine Westphalia, Germany, neighboring state of Netherlands."
4058,But we still have more rules than Netherlands and most discotheques won't open because with incidence higher 10 they need to close again.
4059,You are much safer and much less likely to get sick and pass on covid when you're vaccinated.
4060,People spreading misinformation are rampant everywhere these days.
4061,"The only reason skepticism is 
reasonable is we don't know the long term effects of taking this vaccine because it's only been around for a year and change so far, but since we've been using vaccines for 80+ years I'm willing to concede that they probably have figured out how to minimize those problems."

4065,"A negative test is not 100 percent accurate because it was a LFT test aka rapid test, not pcr."
4066,So with many guests probability is high that there is one positive case.

4143,Based on the current speed of vaccination the EU will have vaccinated enough to fully vaccinate 70% of its population by the 10th of August.
4144,"Unfortunately speed has dropped off in many EU countries, especially in central and Eastern Europe."
4145,In Western Europe it is still going at full speed though.

4162,By mandating something that has not received approval by the very agency medical professionals claim is so trustworthy you basically prove the entire system is a joke.
4163,Bold move
4164,The most important decision is to get vaccinated; the choice of vaccine is of secondary importance.
4165,"There is a lot more data about the real life efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine, the data on the J&amp;J vaccine primarily comes from their clinical trials and in vitro testing."
4166,The only data on efficacy vs the Delta variant is in vitro - exposing the blood of a vaccinated person to the virus in a petri dish and seeing if the blood exhibits immunity titers.
4167,"Pfizer, on the other hand has been used in many countries where its efficacy can be tracked; there is a lot of data on Pfizer vs the Delta variant, relatively speaking."
4168,"It's also likely, based on clinical trials, that Pfizer provides more protection (yes, it's true that the trials were not conducted at the same time or with exactly the same methods, but I think Pfizer has the stronger case for efficacy overall)."
4169,"Obviously, Pfizer requires two doses and J&amp;J only one."
4170,J&amp;J has a known issue with a very rare blood clotting problem in a very small number of women of child-bearing age.
4171,"The reports were scary on this when they first happened, but the medical community now knows how to handle these issues."
4172,"Pfizer (and Moderna) has a known, but rare association with myocarditis/percarditis (inflammation of the heart/tissues surrounding the heart), primarily in young men."
4173,There don't appear to be any serious outcomes with these problems.
4174,I do not believe there is good data showing that J&amp;J provides more immunity faster.
4175,"In fact, the protection provided two weeks after the first dose of Pfizer appears to be as good (or better) than the efficacy four weeks after J&amp;J."
4176,"For most people, the choice will come down to more proven efficacy (Pfizer) vs. convenience of one dose (J&amp;J)."
4177,Either is a good choice.
4178,The decision to get vaccinated is the more important one.
4179,We don‚Äôt sequence every genome from every positive case.

4222,"I think it's really been a procurement and supply issue for most of the world, unfortunately."
4223,"Couple that with places doing ""good"" leading to complacency, because that's human."
4224,"Now with the hyper aggressive delta variant it's just the perfect storm to hit a lot of places that got through the last year+ ""relatively"" O-K unfortunately."
4225,"Dont worry like i said a few weeks back,  we will spread delta far and wide when we start to go camping next week!"
4226,Really looking forward next week if eu goverments will start banning dutch for vacation time.
4227,"I'd just lowkey hope to die, ya know, instead of suffering side effects of a virus for a lifetime."

4254,Does vaccine not reduce the risk of long covid symptoms too?
4255,Why wouldn't it?
4256,"The reality is that this disease won't be eradicated from the planet in years, probably ever, so it will circulate and mutate until one year it catches you and me despite vaccination."
4257,"If vaccines don't give protection against all kinds of symptoms (I bet it does help to reduce mild, severe, long, whatever symptoms) we're pretty much screwed."
4258,The effect of vaccination will also wane as time passes and we will need boosters.
4259,Will probably be included in fou shots in upcoming years.

4291,You mean because they are less than 10% vaccinated?
4292,"I'm afraid this will only lead to more high-risk residents feeling proud of themselves, like they're being brave or something for rebelling against the urging and attending indoor mass gatherings."
4293,Just as so many are smug in their failure to get vaccinated.
4294,"Mississippi had actually been a leader in childhood vaccination rates, which makes it all the more of a shame they have such an abysmal rate of Covid vaccinations."
4295,"From 1979 until 2015, Mississippi and West Virginia were the only two states that did not offer non-medical exemptions for compulsory school vaccination policies."

4366,Coming from Norway and being 34 years I‚Äôm extremely pleased that I can be fully vaccinated 2 months before I would in Norway and weeks before most other Western European countries.
4367,This must be a proof that how vaccines are highly effective.
4368,UK cases may look higher but they do over 1 million tests daily and also do tests to kids because of that probably russia has way more cases than Uk in reality and even with these numbers their daily death numbers nearly 25-30 times of Uk

4370,Janssen vaccine is produced as a one shot vaccine.

* Never stopping flights from countries with high infections
* Head of the RIVM basically telling everyone to not bother wearing masks because they aren't 100% effective
* The RIVM saying its unlikely the delta variant comes to the Netherlands (because this assumption went so well the first time)
* The government telling companies it is fine to commute into the office again
* The government letting NS advertise their services when they don't bother enforcing mask wearing and have overcrowded trains despite many people still not using their services
* The government saying masks aren't needed when Delta variant is on our doorstep
* The government absolutely screwing up the start of the vaccine program, putting us weeks, if not months behind
* The government telling young people to get screwed by opening everything up before allowing young people the opportunity to get vaccinated
* The government using cheap measure like an 8pm curfew and no alcohol being purchased after 8pm - affecting everyone's freedom for being too incompetent at enforcing rules that should mean the aforementioned aren't necessary at all."

4412,The gov will declare lockdown and people will take it as a challenge to find workarounds.

4426,"And yet even after 4 variants and the Delta+ mutation you can still have an high degree of protection from the first 3 vaccine all made in the West or India if you take both shoot while the Sinovac need a booster from another ""Western"" vaccine."

4430,We zijn in de halve finale beland van de ECDC.

4448,"You can make this argument again when we're at 80%+ fully vaccinated, not now that we're barely at 40%."
4449,Yes but won't the tests still show up as infected when you get tested anyway?
4450,Thus completely defeating the point of tests when you are vaccinated?
4451,"Because a LOT of people were tested that didn't have any symptoms, just so they could go to a party."
4452,Doesn't that give a lot of positive tests that aren't important at all?
4453,"Ugh, all I see in this article is the same ""Oh, we're out of it,"" mentality."

4466,You are right.
4467,"Individually, vaccine does not completely eliminate the risk of being infected and carrying the virus."
4468,But it reduces the contagious period and lowers the probability enough to slow down the spread on a *population scale*.
4469,"So all things being equal, living in a vaccinated community is safer than being vaccinated yourself"
4470,The fact that this was necessary is insane.
4471,Is being anti-vaxx growing among people who work in medicine or have humans always been so insanely stupid
4472,"I mean it's good news sure, but the bigger news should be that we are at over two-thirds of our population (not just eligible ones, the entire population) with first jabs, and targeting that same proportion with two jabs by early next month."
4473,"It's great that case numbers are low, but these will rise somewhat as restrictions are gradually loosened."
4474,"As long as hospitalizations and deaths remain under control and vaccinations remain high and effective, we'll be able to navigate out of this pandemic."
4475,"just Google vaccine efficacy rate, vaccine death rate and Covid deaths in relation to being vaccinated."
4476,Those numbers alone show an overwhelming confidence in the vaccine.

4505,Yooo WTF?
4506,"You must be joking, this mentality is completely fucked up."
4507,"The EU is the biggest vaccine producer in the west, has consistently exported more than half it's production."
4508,"Extrapolating from that, they have exported more than China by now."
4509,I know.
4510,That‚Äôs why I said that it doesn‚Äôt require a gym.
4511,"But, I just wanted to chime in on the importance of getting some movement and eating a decent diet in regards to a happy life."
4512,I am a fitness/swim/aerial acrobatics instructor who is just now starting to get back to doing what I love after the pandemic.
4513,It makes such a positive impact on our lives when we spend time being active.
4514,Doesnt have to be inside a gym at all.
4515,Can absolutely be anything.
4516,Find something you love that you are comfortable with.
4517,"Biking, hiking, walking, yoga at home, circus‚Ä¶anything."
4518,I added the part about nutrition/eating well because I have been really bad about that myself.
4519,I actually lost weight from depression during the lockdowns.
4520,"We all respond differently to stress, and I kinda shelled up during lockdowns and ate less."
4521,I have been working on eating more variety in fruits and veggies.
4522,(Because I have been lazy and eating carbs.)
4523,"The takeaway is, find an exercise you love, and a healthy diet that works for you."
4524,Doesn‚Äôt have to be to lose weight or gain weight.
4525,It‚Äôs just as important for our mental health as it is for our physical health.
4526,"It‚Äôs been a tough year, and we should nourish our minds, bodies &amp; souls."
4527,Does this also mean inactivated vaccines aren't effective against Delta?
4528,"No, it's not ""broken"" it's weakened for sure."
4529,Plenty of double vaccinated people are dying and as cases increase then more will die.
4530,Just not as many as before.
4531,Known....
4532,"Yeah, I have a friend who recovered from SARS and suffers from damaged lungs to this day."
4533,She joked that the only good thing to come out from that was she was first in line to get the COVID vaccine.
4534,What about booster shots or to soon ?
4535,Hindsight‚Äôs proven to be powerful here.
4536,"At the time of ordering vaccinations no one would‚Äôve expected mRNA to be as successful as it was, which is likely why so much stock went into adenovirus vectors (AstraZeneca) and protein based (Novavax)."
4537,Indeed the UQ and AZ options were particularly appealing because they could be produced locally.
4538,Would we be having this conversation now if Novavax didn‚Äôt have supply chain issues?
4539,Or if we got more AZ doses out of Europe before thromboembolism was described?
4540,"I‚Äôm amazed by the success of the mRNA vaccine, but putting that much hope on an unproven vaccine methodology would‚Äôve been risky at the time."
4541,"Saying that, fat cheques should‚Äôve been written when the phase 3 trials were finished."
4542,The boomer response that this isn‚Äôt a race is outright bullshit.
4543,Get ready for their gov to make a move to try to land a promotion to leader of the country in 24!
4544,[removed]
4545,I think counting on people who deny the existence of the thing you want them to avoid is not going to work.
4546,"Considering under 30s were only offered their first dose of the vaccine around 4 weeks ago and many won‚Äôt be getting their second until the month or so after reopening, this frankly feels like a kick in the teeth"
4547,"Yup, it's fortunately not bad overall in the Union."
4548,But the reluctance in some places is really worrying.
4549,Bulgaria might not get out of this pandemic for several years...
4550,"From a pure science basis, we've been conducting a really complicated mass experiment for the past year and a half with billions of participants; every different governmental and private distancing, masking, gathering model and a bunch of different vaccinations, and of course, the 'control group.'"
4551,What proportion of young people who get the virus will die or be disabled?
4552,That I did... what a farce.
4553,I went to Disneyland this week.
4554,I'd say only about 1/4 of people had masks.
4555,A little more for children below the age of 12 who we know can't get vaccinated yet...maybe 1/3 had masks.
4556,"No social distancing...all queues are as they always were...all social distancing removed, people one after the other in close proximity."
4557,Haunted Mansion?
4558,Asked for everyone to cram into the elevator like normal or we couldn't go on the ride.
4559,Indoors at Mr. Toad...asked to move the queue along taking up all available space.
4560,"I thought about complaining, but the sentiment here is the govt says we can open, so we can be open....this is not confined to Disneyland."
4561,"The thing is, if someone's wearing a mask at this point, you know they're likely vaccinated because few would choose a mask (especially in this heat) over getting vaccinated."
4562,"There were families where parents weren't wearing masks but kids were, so I figure the parents are likely vaccinated."
4563,Putting those together I'd say about 2/5 to 1/2 were likely vaccinated based on mask wearing alone.
4564,I wish all this wasn't so politicized.
4565,"I ran into a friend's parent who talked my ear off about how my kids shouldn't get the vaccine...how it has metals and fetal tissues and isn't approved by the FDA, and all the conspiracy theorist talking points."
4566,"She was shocked I ""didn't know"" about these things."
4567,I told her I trusted science and my doctor's recommendations.
4568,"All this being said, I'm not surprised we're seeing an increase in cases."
4569,Those who aren't vaccinated now get a free pass to go do anything without being masked.
4570,I got it this Thursday.
4571,Felt like a heart attack
4572,Definitely wouldn't want you treating me
4573,"The upper class and owners are vaccinated, anyone else isn't worth knowing if they're sick or infected by their standards."
4574,This is like here in catalunya a week ago.
4575,I‚Äôm assuming the delta is going to make an entrance all over Europe and we‚Äôll be reliving it all over...
4576,"[Public Health England said that the data showed there was a higher risk of hospital admission for patients with the delta variant compared with the alpha variant, but its analysis2 revealed that two doses of vaccine gave a high degree of protection against hospital admission, estimated to be more than 90%.](https://www.bmj.com/content/373/bmj.n1596)."
4577,"The *rate* of hospitalizations is higher, but a lot of people are vaccinated."
4578,"So, my sense is (a) the transmission rate is higher, which leads to more infections; and (b) the UK says the actual rate of admission per 100,000 population is higher, so it's more virulent (bad)."
4579,"Alright, I stand corrected."
4580,Thanks
4581,Pregnancy is really difficult in the best of times so I totally can sympathize with your feelings as you are nearing delivery.
4582,I‚Äôm sure everyone regardless of vaccination will be masked and gloved and they get tested frequently so I think you will be in good hands.
4583,Hospitals have higher rates of vaccination than the general public so there should be herd immunity.
4584,Best of luck to you and your family
4585,"Yes, I have read up about it myself but I don't have a background in medical sciences so can't understand everything completely myself."
4586,"The 3 deaths have been in the older age group, out of which the recent one was a case of ITP and other health conditions."
4587,Using that as an argument against vaccines and only considering data from Australia for a worldwide pandemic doesn't make much sense to me either.
4588,What would stop them from lying on it?
4589,Hopefully it doesn‚Äôt cross-check voter status.
4590,"No, two shots."
4591,"Moderna is one shot as well, isnt it?"
4592,Florida had 30k+ cases in a day.
4593,As did the UK.
4594,"I‚Äôd call that rampant, how is that any less risky  than undeveloped countries?"
4595,The article says that the alternative is to show a negative covid test from the day before.
4596,"Sorry, did you get side effects from the vaccine that lasted 6 weeks?"
4597,Did you report that to the CDC?
4598,And why is that?
4599,It‚Äôs not all by choice and you know it
4600,Still a democracy no?
4601,"You may feel small but if there's a majority with your opinion, you'll get what you want."
4602,"Flip side is, you may also NOT get what you want if you are the minority, and it may not feel that great even if it's the fair way to do things."
4603,"There definitely comes a point tho, where enough people are against unneccessary lockdowns(whether or not they are unnecessary is totally subjective, I'm talking about what people think of them!)"
4604,and then it will not happen.
4605,"Hang in there, normalcy will come and your vaccination helped to push it closer."
4606,Absolutely agree with all of this.
4607,People can‚Äôt seem to be able to think of what‚Äôs reasonable for them to do.
4608,"Just looking a the figures for Australia right now.. and apparently for the whole pandemic they've had 910 deaths from 31,000 cases (1 in 34) and if what you say is true, 3 deaths from 8,700,000 vaccinations (1 in 2,900,000)."
4609,People who try to make out that the vaccine is more dangerous normally go through some insane loopholes and backwards logic to justify their points.
4610,Either completely misleading and more likely just lying.
4611,[removed]
4612,[removed]
4613,"That‚Äôs because Sinovac is one of the very first, of course it won‚Äôt be as effective against delta."
4614,China has more than that vaccine you know.
4615,"I‚Äôm all for more vaccines for poorer nations, but it seems only China actually keeps delivering."
4616,Meanwhile it‚Äôs leftovers or Indian produced ones from the west.
4617,I just don‚Äôt see the pandemic getting under control if you‚Äôre counting on the west for vaccine help.
4618,"We‚Äôll end up at omega before US, EU, UK and Canada decide to match China‚Äôs vaccine amount."
4619,"Sadly there will always be people like my dad to keep the 30% unvaccinated, ‚Äúbecause mRNA tech is dangerous and the key is to maintain a healthy diet‚Äù."
4620,"My family has had dangerous history with the vaccines (my sister can die from it), so I can understand some of the reluctance, but the levels of mental gymnastics is wild."
4621,"It may end up like the very first surge, where people with no immune protections were not social distancing or wearing masks, and rapid caseload increases despite reasonable hospitalization rates overwhelmed health systems."
4622,Hopefully not though.
4623,Despite low vaccination rates there are a lot more people who are protected now.
4624,After a quick review of the nature article.
4625,I think you are comparing real world data of the other two with clinical trial data of Janssen.
4626,Those are different in setup.
4627,"Until a similar study is performed with the Janssen vaccin, you cannot compare the numbers."
4628,Peddling antivax propaganda backfired hard.
4629,This shows Putin isn‚Äôt some master tactician.
4630,"If you‚Äôre experiencing the same pandemic, sowing antivax propaganda hard would inevitably bite you in the ass later on."
4631,So sad for ordinary Russians.
4632,They deserve better.
4633,Calling other countries ‚Äòidiots‚Äô because they kept Covid out better than your country isn‚Äôt putting your own folk first or normal.
4634,This post appears to be about vaccines.

4644,It‚Äôs like people can‚Äôt think of what‚Äôs a reasonable action to take.
4645,Uncontrolled spread is the default.
4646,It's also the constant goal of the virus.
4647,"When you let people do their own thing and you don't make them do what needs to be done to get the upper hand on the virus, uncontrolled spread is the result you're going to get."
4648,"Unfortunately, this seems to be true just about everywhere in the world, and to be rooted in human behavior."
4649, Not testing either.
4650,Too unreliable
4651,Republicans cuckin for Covid
4652,"You are 100% free to not reveal your vaccination status, and present a negative test instead."
4653,"The vaccine passports work with both, there's pretty much nothing vaccinated people can do that unvaccinated people can't in more or less all of europe"
4654,It's just going to be the sheer number of cases.
4655,Two Whitehall sourced on the Guardian payroll hey.

4657,You can look [at this year-old picture](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Is_COVID-19_like_a_flu%3F_ENG.png) comparing peak flu ICU hospitalizations/deaths with peak Covid ICU hospitalizations/death (in Italy).
4658,"If it‚Äôs not mayhem now, what makes you think it‚Äôll turn into mayhem knowing delta doesn‚Äôt cause more hospitalizations?"
4659,It only is that easy in a dictatorial regime.
4660,In a democracy you'll have people wanting more freedom vs more control.

4664,It just isn't that simple to take these kind of decisions without consent from the people.
4665,Could they have done better: Yes ofcourse.
4666,Should we (citizens) have done better: absolutely.
4667,I feel comfortable going to the gym.
4668,"If you're fully vaccinated, you're pretty safe."
4669,"Unless there is a tremendously high positive test rate in your area, I wouldn't worry."
4670,YMMV.
4671,Vaccines offer protection even if it‚Äôs not 100%.
4672,Around 90% for now.
4673,Risk of spreading the virus for the vaccinated population is 1/25 when compared with spread in the wild.
4674,Majority of the vaccinated will get a booster shot if needed.
4675,So the chance of wiping out the deniers is quite high on all fronts.

4712,"So while certain countries have much higher vaccination rates, the vast majority are still largely unvaccinated now."
4713,This obviously has implications for everyone on the planet.

4914,"It is very, very rare."
4915,I believe he is referencing the fact that you may not have an adequate immune response to the vaccine despite having received a full course.
4916,This doesn‚Äôt have anything to do it being activated vs. inactivated.
4917,From data I have seen this matters more for transplant patients on immune suppressants for organ rejection.

4943,A natural virus couldn't possibly be this bad.
4944,And that a good immune system is all you need.
4945,"But confirmation bias is a dangerous thing - if someone happened to have a mild case of covid, they might interpret that as ""my immune system is good, covid wasn't that bad, therefore why risk unknown vaccine?"""

5058,What happens when the unvaccinated fill up hospitals?
5059,We can‚Äôt just sit back because whether we like it or not it affects us.
5060,One of the main reasons why America‚Äôs COVID response has been an unmitigated disaster is people reason from ‚Äúlet‚Äôs wait and see if hospitals get overwhelmed before we decide if we need to do anything.‚Äù Every country that has spared its citizens from mass death and infections has acted early and effectively to suppress the disease.
5061,And this doesn‚Äôt mean reactively locking down just before you‚Äôre about to be filling freezer trucks with bodies.
5062,"It means taking sensible suppressive measure, like requiring indoor masking until we actually have vaccination numbers that control spread, international travel quarantines, and maybe localized lockdowns, sometimes only of unnecessary congregate settings (places like bars and restaurants)."
5063,Essentially what South Korea has been going for the whole pandemic.
5064,"The inability to reason beyond the two options of ‚Äúlet people do whatever they want, with uncontrolled spread‚Äù vs hard, late lockdowns is why we have hundreds of thousands dead relative to the diminishingly  small numbers in other countries."

5073,I think you are wrong here and flu vaccines have a variable effect yearly.
5074,Some years are great coverage.
5075,Some there is enough mutation or one strain was not accounted for well and then we end up with things like the H1N1 epidemic in 2009.
5076,Covid passes more readily than flu and each variant seems to have increased how well it spreads if not how deadly it is.
5077,We also have limited data on how effective vaccines are to the delta variant at this point.
5078,"And to reiterate, places like Florida with the low vaccination rate, high travel/tourism, and low regard for any preventative mechanisms (masking, distancing, etc) is an optimal situation for allowing new variants time and space to grow and evolve."

5095,tin foil hat time...
5096,I think the authorities want to get this over with and get economies fully opened.
5097,So they are going for a herd immunity strategy.
5098,"Those who have protected themselves with vaccines, will mostly be fine."
5099,"The unvaccinated, will develop natural immunity or die."
5100,It's the only reason I can see for removing the mask mandate when you have a variant that is so much more contagious than the original virus.
5101,"Yeah but it turns out after a year of masking, we could have been preventing needless flu deaths as well."
5102,"Self Absorbed people don't care who they hurt, they will always make excuses for their actions but when they deal with these same issues feel it unfair."

5130,"And even before Delta it was supposed to be near 100%, not 100%."
5131,Seems that it's time to prepare the booster or a v2 to defeat the newest variants.
5132,[removed]
5133,This is purely anecdotal but I‚Äôve seen 3 patients now that have experienced lasting psychosis for the first time since having COVID.
5134,One guy was in his 50s and well past the age of onset for schizophrenia.
5135,"It‚Äôs very, very strange."
5136,I think you are and flu vaccines have a variable effect yearly.
5137,Some years are great coverage.
5138,Some there is enough mutation or one strain was not accounted for well and then we end up with things like the H1N1 epidemic in 2009.
5139,Covid passes more readily than flu and each variant seems to have increased how well it spreads if not how deadly it is.
5140,We also have limited data on how effective vaccines are to the delta variant at this point.
5141,"And to reiterate, places like Florida with the low vaccination rate, high travel/tourism, and low regard for any preventative mechanisms (masking, distancing, etc) is an optimal situation for allowing new variants time and space to grow and evolve."
5142,Viral evolution is not the centuries long process that larger organisms deal with for active spreading pathogens.
5143,I've been trying to find data about the risk of myocarditis from viruses themselves.
5144,All I could find was a myocarditis organization saying that viruses are the most common cause.
5145,"There's so much paranoia on Twitter about adverse side effects from vaccines, but seemingly no concern or understanding that viruses like Covid also can cause myocarditis."
5146,Ya don‚Äôt say??
5147,?
5148,This is purely anecdotal but I‚Äôve seen 3 patients now that have experienced lasting psychosis for the first time since having COVID.

5152,Headline is dangerously misleading and leads to vaccine hesitancy.
5153,This question is a clear signal that they will be rising for the next month.
5154,That's been the trend throughout the pandemic.
5155,"When lots of people are saying ""what about hospitalizations and deaths"" they will rise dramatically over the next month."
5156,Stupid argument.
5157,Nobody is against vaccinating kids for polio.
5158,"However, I am totally against vaccinating kids from a virus that is statistically less of a risk to children than the seasonal flu."
5159,Same difference
5160,It does actually.
5161,E.g.
5162,heart complications are just as much an issue with the flu.
5163,What a way to sweep you off your feet.
5164,"This is **ancedotal evidence** on my part, but when I got my 2nd Pfizer dose back in April, my doctor said I might have to come in the Fall for a 3rd shot (booster)."

5178,"We can do it the easy way, or we can do it the hard way."
5179,It's amazing that there are so many people willing to do it the hard way.
5180,Because the number of cases exceed what is normally seen in that age group over that time period.
5181,With the only common factor being time proximity of the vaccinations.
5182,More deductive researching and elimination than straight out proof of causality.
5183,I don't think that idea is tinfoilhatty at all.
5184,I think it's exactly what the CDC intended when they dropped their mask requirement advisory.
5185,They obviously knew that many unvaccinated people would also choose to go without masks and that there would be no realistic way to tell who was vaccinated or not.
5186,Herd immunity is pretty much the only practical strategy for the USA at this point.
5187,The social ending of the pandemic in most of the country is clearly here; people were not going to comply with restrictions all summer long.
5188,"Might as well get the unvaccinated infected now while hospitalizations are low rather than having them get hit brutally all at once in the fall, when respiratory infection rates always increase."
5189,https://www.statista.com/statistics/1191568/reported-deaths-from-covid-by-age-us/
5190,I had the vaccine right before leaving on a long term trip to a different state where my insurance doesn‚Äôt work.
5191,I‚Äôve been having weird heart symptoms since may that I haven‚Äôt been able to get checked out.
5192,It‚Äôs very alarming.
5193,I don‚Äôt think people should be downplaying this or at least I think that healthcare should be more accessible for people that might have these side effects.
5194,"Well, the other vaccines carry a similar amount of risk of blood clots."
5195,I'd take temporary myocarditis over potentially lethal blood clots.
5196,Neither are really likely to happen though.
5197,Get your shots.
5198,Thanks for the comprehensive write up with sources!
5199,Not sure if trolling but nearly every study I've seen has shown masks make little difference in the school setting.

5209,Ya but that's been going on since last summer.
5210,Didn't some conservative clam from California make that assertion last year?
5211,Lol
5212,I don't understand the whole idea of vaccination certificates.
5213,"Basically, the concept seems to be to find a way to let people do things that would be too dangerous to do otherwise."
5214,So the hope is to mitigate the increased danger of a voluntary activity?
5215,Like putting on a Kevlar vest and then walking into a crowd of people shooting each other?
5216,Am I missing something here?
5217,"In my state, if you had a positive COVID test, they ask you to wait four weeks from the end of symptoms before you get vaccinated."
5218,not 1 in 50!!
5219,omg what is wrong with you people
5220,Good we'll call the next variant the florida variant.
5221,[deleted]
5222,"Basically, the rules were dropped too soon."
5223,"On 26 june the government decided to do away with masks, distancing, and limits in places that required testing for entry, but the testing for entry system was really flawed."
5224,"For example, some partygoers screenshotted their QR codes and sent them to friends that didn‚Äôt test, and bouncers didn‚Äôt properly check ID."
5225,The labs doing the testing were also very overwhelmed given that many people wanted a test to be able to go out in the first weekend so they ended up rushing a lot of negative results to people even when they didn‚Äôt test their samples.
5226,There was even one case where one guy who was positive was accidentally given a negative result and he partied with a lot of people.
5227,"To top it off, these cases are basically among the age group that went out and have the lowest rates of vaccination because they were just offered the option very recently."
5228,"The entire thing was a poorly thought out disaster, basically."
5229,Or that it's almost entirely in young males.
5230,"Media wants outrage and clicks, not succinct and accurate articles."
5231,There are a lot of different ways a person can be immunocompromised.
5232,"Just because you can get the shot, doesn't mean everybody can."
5233,"Maybe I missed something in the article, but where is the 90% effectiveness number coming from?"
5234,It kinda seems like they pulled that number out of thin air.
5235,Great news if true though!
5236,I've literally not heard anyone outside of this subreddit say they want a lockdown again.
5237,America will simply not lockdown again.
5238,"Yes, they basically opened up everything just as delta strain became dominant."
5239,"Masses of people took to night clubs to celebrate, but also elsewhere masks are no longer worn (no longer required either) and people basically no longer keep distance (officially still required)."
5240,"At this point they only shut down night clubs and bars, and it will probably take them about three weeks to recognize (or aquire proof beyond any doubt?)"
5241,that it will not be sufficient.
5242,This is so gross.
5243,We have access to vaccine.
5244,A privilege that the rest of the world want and these people are refusing to get vaccinated.

5251,Real reason many refused vaccines is because how it is being used for political purposes.
5252,In my life I have never seen vaccines or flu shots being pushed so hard upon people to take them.
5253,It was purely choice.
5254,Then all of suddenly election year and how Democrats and Republicans used covid as part of political game.
5255,I am sorry to say this.
5256,Timing was too strange and wrong.
5257,I believe it was why many don't believe covid is real because it was being politicalized.

5259,"At least, let people make their decisions."

5262,"&gt; ""Americans who have been fully vaccinated do not need a booster shot at this time,"" the CDC and FDA wrote in the statement."

5314,"They're simply removing the legal mandate, to allow people to use their own discretion."
5315,"Both repeatedly said they would recommend, and would personally be wearing them in crowded public transport, public indoor spaces, or when someone else might be uncomfortable, but dropping the legal mandate allows someone on an empty train carriage to not worry about having their mask on."
5316,They said repeatedly this is just about removing legal diktat.

5318,"No no, it's German for, The Bart The."
5319,"Different countries have different advice about the optimal amount of time to wait

For example, in the UK they recommend
You can have the vaccine 28 days after you had a positive test for COVID-19 or 28 days after your symptoms started, 

If you are treated with monoclonal antibodies for covid symptoms, check with your doctor before getting vaccinated as you may be recommended to wait longer"

5321,I read a paper on covid reserch which stated that patients are far more likely to have vascular complications with catching the virus than the miniscule chance with the vaccine.

5333,I‚Äôve just been through a lot this past year as has the rest of the world.
5334,I‚Äôve lost family and friends to covid.
5335,I guess it has all made me a bit paranoid.
5336,My town has had very low vaccination rates so that hasn‚Äôt helped my mind as much.
5337,"My family is on ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt stop living in fear‚Äù and ‚ÄúThings have to get back to normal eventually.‚Äù

5338,1.
5339,"It‚Äôs the third time going in, like, 8 years, so not that normal an occurrence."
5340,And 2.
5341,What part of doing literally anything that doesn‚Äôt involve wanting to travel to Florida right now equate to ‚Äúliving in fear.‚Äù
5342,study used:
5343,No I agree.
5344,If the COVID19 vaccine had the same complication it would've become apparent back in January.
5345,"I've gotten both shots myself, and while the side effects are uncomfortable I still recommend my friends and relatives to take it as well."
5346,"But I was on the fence up until March because of the H1N1 vaccine side effect, and I think it's a main reason why some Swedes are reluctant to vaccinate against COVID19."
5347,You can't change human behavior.
5348,"And the response, while massive and impressive, is still too often too little, too late."
5349,That's why the virus has killed millions and will continue to kill and cripple.
5350,"It's very sad, but there's only so much we can do about it."
5351,"&gt; ""I'm concerned as this variant becomes more dominant, those select areas of the country that have a very low level of vaccination, like 30% or so, you're going to start seeing mini-surges that are localized to certain regions,"" [Fauci] said Friday."
5352,"There's a persistent spin that only some areas of the country are going to see spikes, but it's hard for me to believe that the difference between vaccination rates of 30% and 50% is going to be a huge factor for a variant whose R0 is between 6 and 8."
5353,I think this is just whistling in the dark.
5354,"&gt; A breakthrough infection should be thought of as ""vaccine success"" as opposed to vaccine failure, Walensky said, because the vaccine is doing what it was developed to do: prevent severe disease and death."
5355,"This is definitely a big move of the goalposts for the covid vaccines, for better or worse."
5356,"The narrative up to now has been that vaccines will both keep you from contracting covid no matter what you do, and prevent you from spreading it to others."
5357,"I actually think it's a more realistic attitude, but it's coming kind of late in the day."
5358,Spain is already fucked cases-wise.
5359,Italy is better but cases are ramping up right now and the health minister Speranza has had a very heavy hand on restrictions last year so maybe there will be closures.
5360,Thank you a lot üòä
5361,This is unlikely to apply to vaccinated people for many reasons.
5362,"1) regarding testing positive - Someone who is vaccinated still needs to mount an immune response to squash the virus and the pcr tests can pick up tiny amounts of virus fragments, far lower than what is needed to transmit the virus or cause any symptoms."
5363,In fact the test won‚Äôt be able to tell if it is a viral fragment (meaning no live replicating virus) or live replicating virus.
5364,2) you just cannot compare the immune response in someone who is vaccinated to someone who is unvaccinated.
5365,Most of the long Covid symptoms appear to be from the immune system going wonky and mounting an autoimmune response.
5366,This should not happen in someone who is vaccinated.
5367,The immune response is already primed - there is no learning stage where immune misdirection into autoimmunity would happen.
5368,3) The immune response is already primed and ready to go - there should not be a period where the virus is replicating like crazy and causing micro vascular damage increasing the chance of sudden death.
5369,4) you can see evidence of a shifting immune response happening in the symptom changes for people who have vaccine breakthrough cases.
5370,"The four top symptoms are headache, runny nose, sore throat, and cough."
5371,Basically - allergies or a mild cold.
5372,It‚Äôs the same symptom profile as young children have and most won‚Äôt even consider Covid as a possibility.
5373,Wrong.
5374,"My coworker just tested positive, for all we know my coworkers have it but we all feel fine."
5375,Maybe they decided to get tested because they were in contact with someone else who did.

5379,"I am an American, I am in the third world too!"
5380,"I didn't know about this - but by long term (totally the wrong term there, sorry) I meant... Years down the line."
5381,Which is what people are scared of typically with vaccine reactions.
5382,Immediate reactions absolutely happen and we see them and we respond to them.
5383,"Usually in over the top ways - like the Lyme vaccine, which had some questionable side effects that science generally considered to be bollocks, but the media ruined that for everyone."
5384,"So, lemme rephrase - no vaccine (that I know of, by all means correct me) was administered to large numbers of people and later found to have scary side effects years down the line."
5385,"I am an American, I am in the third world too!"
5386,One dose seems to provide *less* protection against the delta variant but is still [very effective based on the Ontario data](https://twitter.com/BogochIsaac/status/1412060322643464196).
5387,"The confidence intervals are very high, but even at the low-end one dose is very protective against hospitalization/death from the delta variant."

5392,Only a minority of people have gotten infected around the world.
5393,So yea it‚Äôs theoretically possible but that would mean a ton more misery around the world before it ends that way.
5394,There is a laundry list of possible side effects.
5395,"And you might get COVID, you will get the second shot, so the side effects need to be a lot less for it to make sense."
5396,Hell WHO has said don‚Äôt vaccinate children under 12 because it‚Äôs too dangerous at the moment.
5397,"And let‚Äôs not forget that this vaccine technology has existed for about 2 decades, but has never been allowed for use in humans."

5410,It's also not enough to tell people what they need to do.
5411,You have to make them do it.
5412,"Some will do it on their own, but too many simply won't."
5413,"I assumed early on that people would get on board with NPIs a lot faster than they did, and I was totally wrong about that."
5414,You can still get Covid when you are vaccinated you just won‚Äôt get seriously ill.  People do realize this right?

5419,I'm planning on the same move from the Tampa area in the next year or so
5420,I would wait at least 3 weeks.
5421,From what I heard you need two exposures (infection or vaccination) with that much gap in between to build lasting immunity
5422,So should we try to change human behavior?
5423,Or change our response?
5424,Also isnt J&amp;J even less effective against Delta than the original strains?

5450,Are you using an N99 mask?
5451,[removed]
5452,Like a 3rd you mean?
5453,You can't tell anything from that small of a sample.
5454,"Take 4 working-age unvaccinated people who get COVID and it's unlikely that any of them will be hospitalized , for example."
5455,I think it takes a while to do the sequencing also.
5456,Much longer that a simple covid test.
5457,I checked prices at a Hampton Inn I stay in upstate NY.
5458,"Before the pandemic it was around $105, during the pandemic it dipped below $80 and now the rates are around $240 and even up to $280 with all summer weekends completely sold out."
5459,The Hampton Inn is the most basic kind of hotels for travelers.
5460,Nothing fancy.
5461,"Decent room, used to have breakfast in the morning."

5464,"That may only happen in unvaccinated states, not everywhere."
5465,"I never said ""people don't experience"" hospitalization."
5466,"Obviously, hundreds of thousands of people in the US have and died from it."
5467,You're not actually engaging with my statement here.
5468,"I am saying most people thay have gotten COVID, as in the tens millions that have had it, have not come away with it with broken organs or a long term loss of taste or smell."
5469,"Like I said before, you're greatly exaggerating the risks of COVID for people not part of an at-risk population, and I would say thay is contributing to vaccine hesistancy."
5470,"Not everyone has to be on board with you pretty much lying about the risks most people would have to internalize, whether they choose to get the vaccine or not."
5471,Unvaccinated people are incubators for variants.
5472,"The current vaccines may work well on the Delta Variant, but how about the next one that comes along?"
5473,We simply don't know.
5474,Fuck 'em unfortunately doesn't work well for anyone in this scenario.
5475,"No I absolutely agree with that, but it would still be nice to know what percent of people being tested are vaccinated vs non vaccinated.. logic would obvious be that even though vax are probably catching at the same rate as non vax, they are not showing symptoms or have a reason to test .. conventional wisdom is that a high majority being tested is non vax but just wanted to know if there was data to support that"
5476,"How could Netherlands not get Delta, isn‚Äôt Amsterdam a major transit hub from Asian and globally?"
5477,No one who speaks German could be an evil man
5478,"Nope, it passes."
5479,Not to nitpick but it‚Äôs 5946 deaths related to Covid and if you comb through the data it‚Äôs the whole gamut of errors and misleading reports.
5480,A good chunk in the 85 and over bucket where the comments are usually that they were already on hospice or on their way out or had other major factors.
5481,Another good chunk under 12 where vaccines aren‚Äôt allowed.
5482,Another good chunk where people say they were vaccinated last year before the vaccines were out and they died a long time after said vaccine anyway.
5483,Even when you dig through the healthy age population you see lots of other reasons for them to have died.
5484,It‚Äôs kinda like the opposite of the people that scream how a car accident victim is counted as a Covid death.
5485,In any case it was troubling to see some commonalities with heart/blood issues with otherwise healthy adults.
5486,Of course myocarditis happens with a lot of viruses but you don‚Äôt see significant spikes in the reporting deaths until this year.
5487,MM
5488,No one who speaks German could be an evil man
5489,I tried to find studies on how well an N95 protects against COVID and what your chances are of catching it if you‚Äôre only there for a short period of time and couldn‚Äôt find anything.
5490,"And yeah I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs 100% necessary, I could make just do an online appointment, but I won‚Äôt probably have time to ask about that before the appointment so I‚Äôd just have to miss it."
5491,ANd it‚Äôs time sensitive.
5492,I need testing soon to catch if there‚Äôs something bad happening ... and treatment within a few weeks if it‚Äôs what I think it could be..
5493,"The original press release by FAA: [https://www.faa.gov/news/press\_releases/news\_story.cfm?newsId=26300](https://www.faa.gov/news/press_releases/news_story.cfm?newsId=26300)

I'm not even surprised most of these are Low Cost Carriers."
5494,Why hasn‚Äôt Delta spread throughout the US with so few restrictions?
5495,Luck?
5496,"Your numbers are quite crappy, but you have a point."
5497,"Bruh, if you don't think Fauci's comments are heavily rooted in politics let me remind you of how he survived the Trump administration -- surprise, it was by not honestly representing the dangers of the pandemic."
5498,It uses data going back to September 2020.
5499,Was the Delta variant even around then?
5500,"Right, nothing substantial has ever come from such a trash institution."
5501,Nothing but lies
5502,"Well, herd immunity here we come!"
5503,One way or another Covid will run out of people to infect.
5504,Don't confuse him thinking there's life outside of his hometown lol
5505,And this is exactly why life hasn't gone back to normal for me or my family.
5506,"This goalpost has been gradually shifting over the last month or so, and no one seems to be paying attention to it."
5507,I think my concern is for five and one year old‚Ä¶ but also the virus spreading and mutating into something that again becomes super contagious to all‚Ä¶
5508,Check how many cases we had last year this time and how many cases we have this year.
5509,Big difference.
5510,"They work very well, but there are still a lot of unvaccinated people."
5511,"I told him to get tested again, but IDK if false positives are common."
5512,[removed]
5513,Should I get another vaccine if it's true that a lot of breakthrough cases are because of antibodies waning?
5514,I'm thinking about it
5515,"From the report, the monitoring went through to the end of May."
5516,The rest of the time is probably authorship and reviews.
5517,Bureaucracy.
5518,"The other thing to consider is that the [UK counts a covid death as ""someone who dies within 28 days of testing positive""."
5519,"](https://publichealthmatters.blog.gov.uk/2020/08/12/behind-the-headlines-counting-covid-19-deaths/?fbclid=IwAR04jswGeFWJsXB-oVQ25HTjgelPuVQu77k5GO_PKWAnPfDEBpGAXXjLrM8)  So it's possible a good number of those 50 vaccinated covid deaths are ""died with covid"", rather than ""died of covid""."
5520,Would be nice to get some details about those cases.
5521,why can‚Äôt i post links to this subreddit?
5522,who‚Äôs deleting shit?
5523,"whatever

https://wgme.com/news/local/cdc-says-8-mainers-have-died-with-covid-19-after-being-fully-vaccinated"
5524,I mentioned that in my comment.
5525,"The UK has a higher percentage of people fully vaccinated though, which may affect the numbers."
5526,We don't have solid numbers for any of that.
5527,"There are no controlled, double-blinded studies on effectiveness for the Delta variant."
5528,"That's why I used the word ""If"" to start out my statement."
5529,The general principle I illustrated is true for whatever the actual effectiveness.
5530,The equivalence has already been made by skeptics and deniers.
5531,The intent is to clarify those equivalences to real world terms that people understand.
5532,"In that area, the side effects of the vaccine and weighing the risks against the actual symptoms and occurrence from COVID need to be clarified by contrasting the two."
5533,"You can disagree with that, but claiming ‚Äúpeople don‚Äôt experience much of that either‚Äù is completely inaccurate when contrasting the two."
5534,"It is simply wrong to state that ‚Äúpeople don‚Äôt experience‚Äù hospitalization, long term illness, and death at ‚Äúthat high of rates either‚Äù."
5535,It‚Äôs just wrong.
5536,"Contrasting the two, COVID is a million times more harmful and always will be."
5537,"Choose a different thread to get that soapbox on, your claimed intent and actual effect are a mile apart and make it look like you‚Äôre arguing in bad faith."

5540,Don‚Äôt worry.
5541,The N95 mask will keep you safe plus everyone else will also have masks.
5542,Don‚Äôt give yourself so much covid fear that you ignore necessary appointments.
5543,The FDA needs to be the decision maker on this because Pfizer has a conflict of interest (booster means more sales).
5544,Of course the vaccine creator has the expertise so they need to present their evidence for review by the FDA.
5545,I am glad I did not receive the J&amp;J vaccine.
5546,Another example of health officials lying to us months ago when they said that all vaccines are the same and J&amp;J is just as effective as mRNA vaccines.
5547,Nope.
5548,The only reason they said that was to get as many people vaccinated as possible.
5549,Glad I made sure to get an mRNA vaccine instead of listening to the CDC.
5550,[deleted]
5551,Yes the palpitations!
5552,They asked me if I was having them and I incorrectly said no because I didn‚Äôt know what that was.
5553,I was 24 at the time and wasn‚Äôt educated about cardiovascular health.
5554,The palpitations continued for several months after my infection and I still get them occasionally.
5555,"Maybe on Reddit and Twitter, but outside that I don't see that at all."
5556,Most people in the real world are over it I think.
5557,Because vaccines can cause drop of performances and side effects can hinder training.
5558,"Does anyone know what is the percentage breakdown of the covid cases between vaccinated and non vaccinated.. meaning yesterday and day before we saw over 25K cases, which means the number is again growing rapidly.. what percent of this is vaccinated as oppose to non vaccinated.. anyway of knowing.. if it‚Äôs pretty evenly split then I guess the vaccines effectivity isn‚Äôt great, not sure if this data is out there"
5559,Also the state of Florida has about 1/3rd the population of the UK
5560,Or people lie on the internet
5561,"Delta parties among not yet vaccinated young people mostly, I presume."
5562,There are people in other countries that are wanting to take the vaccine that we have but won't take.
5563,"If we didn't export the vaccines that these idiots refuse to take, then twice as many people are going to be endangered."
5564,Not as big of a mental leap as you might think.
5565,There have been thousands of vaccinated people that have been hospitalized or died of covid in the US.
5566,"It's still rare, but does happen."
5567,The mRNA vaccines are 93% effective against severe illness (hospitalization or death).
5568,Is that considered almost 100%?
5569,Maybe...not quite though.
5570,The mechanism of action to why this happens would be key to prevent this from happening.
5571,Yet CDC doesn‚Äôt think we need boosters.....Pzifer thinks so they are still pushing the trials internally to create a booster.
5572,Thank goodness

5580,"The point though is since getting covid puts you at higher risk in general after looking at all aspects in the grand scheme of things, they are RECOMMENDING people to get vaccines to lower % of the overall branch of issues you could get."
5581,"I'm telling you, if there were vaccines for every disease out there, would you take it or live with the much higher risks of not getting and having higher % risks for everything?"
5582,"Most people will take it, especially when they realise that the people who had vaccines for everything really aren't getting sick over anything."
5583,Only if you get the vaccine.
5584,I'll choose wearing a mask and taking my chances then willingly subjecting myself to taking something that may cause irreversible damage.
5585,I respect your choice to take the vaccine.
5586,Hopefully there are no long term effects and the inventor of the MRNA is over reacting to reports he has seen.
5587,I'm not willing to take that chance.

5593,"The trials were for ""symptomatic COVID."""
5594,It means exactly what I said it means.
5595,"&gt;What the 95% actually means is that vaccinated people had a 95% lower risk of getting COVID-19 compared with the control group participants, who weren't vaccinated."
5596,"In other words, vaccinated people in the Pfizer clinical trial were 20 times less likely than the control group to get COVID-19."

5608,I ended up getting one of those finger heart rate monitors and it seems to be normal now.

5622,Ok.
5623,He's opposed to every reasonable measure of encouraging vaccinations then.
5624,My implication was not to make an equivalency between the risks COVID and the vaccine.
5625,I was suggesting you are dishonestly mischaracterizing the effects COVID has on the majority population that catches it.
5626,I would argue greatly exaggerating the effect COVID has on most people contributes to vaccine hesitancy.

5630,Reading the comments i have one question: do people even know that the Biontech/Pfizer MRNA vaccine is not that great against Delta at all?
5631,I honestly don't wear mine now that I'm vaccinated.
5632,I don't attend large indoor events either but that's not a great loss to me
5633,sounds worse than no vaccine at all that sort of madness.

5639,"Maybe it'll be a while before we have real world data on J&amp;J against the Delta variant, since is far less common than the other vaccines."
5640,&gt; Having that lab there isn‚Äôt direct evidence as such.

5755,Those chip people make me laugh.
5756,Boy no one cares what you do all day.
5757,Unlikely doesn‚Äôt mean impossible.
5758,I‚Äôm not going to be afraid of a disease I‚Äôm vaccinated against because a guy on Reddit knows a guy who was a breakthrough case.
5759,I think his implication was everyone in this comment thread.
5760,"I don't know if you misread what he said or what, but no one here was questioning climate change."
5761,How would you know you have this to seek treatment in the first place?
5762,For all I know I could have had it before/from another time I was sick.

5766,The last time Rogan was funny Phil Hartman was still alive.
5767,"Denial can be a strong coping mechanism, especially when helped along by motivated interests and/or tied to identity."
5768,It does really help one avoid fear and maintain normalcy.
5769,"Unfortunately, it‚Äôs a very bad response in a pandemic for obvious reasons."
5770,"Am also curious about the severity, since it seems that vaccinated people that still contract it have much milder cases."
5771,Wouldn't it be cool if the advancements in vaccines allowed us to have a foothold against the cold?

I really hate this phrase."
5781,It is the normalization of failure.
5782,It pretends that we don't have any good strategies to prevent it so we just have to tough it out and live with it.
5783,"In fact, we do have effective strategies."
5784,We just don't want to do them.
5785,Not yet.
5786,Our full reopening is just over a week away.
5787,I wouldn't be surprise to see another big uptick in a couple of weeks' time.
5788,That's promising but we still don't have real world results yet?
5789,"But as u/zeraussiul says, its been a normal time for the stereotypical multi generational Anglo-Aussie who has no ties overseas."
5790,For the 30% of Australians that are foreign born it definitely hasn't been a normal 18 months.
5791,I have family there who are totally stuck and fuck knows when we'll get to see them again.
5792,My next door neighbour has a son there who had a baby two years ago that they've never met.
5793,"There're countless thousands of people who've had to miss family funerals, can't visit dying parents etc etc."
5794,"Despite seeing what happened in India, it baffles me that people are taking the delta strain lightly."
5795,"In India, people had literally stopped social distancing from December 2020 onwards."
5796,"But from January to March, we didn't see any noticeable rise in the number of cases."
5797,"And after that, the cases just skyrocketed."
5798,The only thing that changed was the delta variant.
5799,And then even those who followed social distancing and wore masks got infected.

5836,"I am fully vaccinated, I got the 2nd Modena shot in February."
5837,I am currently getting my ass kicked by COVID though.
5838,I can't find any doctors who will see me in my area due to no one wanting to see COVID patients.
5839,I am struggling so hard to breath and feel like death.
5840,I have a nebulizer and medication for it.

5844,Did you need to go to the hospital?

5846,Measures are unchanged for months now.
5847,"Yeah, I think every vaccine has breakthrough cases."
5848,I hope you are well and didn't get a severe case!
5849,"I don't think a lockdown is likely either but this sub, the daily threads in particular, is quite an echo chamber."
5850,They exempted people should also have to wear FULL PPE.
5851,"Mask, gloves, face shield and gown."
5852,&gt;	You can‚Äôt compare it to other states without accounting for other variables.
5853,That‚Äôs the whole point.
5854,Claiming your state took covid seriously while the data shows it had higher rates of infection and deaths than the national average is contrarian.
5855,Death isn't a card.

5857,If you don't upgrade your support expires?

5888,"A few scattered thoughts:

* FL's vaccination rate is basically at the national average, so spread here is not a great sign."
5889,"* Older people tend to be more vaccinated, so the death rate should be much lower
* If you're vaccinated, you should be largely safe from severe disease, hospitalization, and death."
5890,[Over 99% of people who have died from COVID since vaccines became widely available were not fully vaccinated](https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-941fcf43d9731c76c16e7354f5d5e187).
5891,"People keep saying this confidently, i know two people and one of them is my family member that got covid twice even after the vaccine and the second time his symptoms were more painful."
5892,"Apparently I got deleted, but I remember that day."
5893,I'm convinced we are just beginning here.
5894,Maybe the fall will being better cases when it's not so hot and people travel outdoors since the summer is too unbearable.
5895,Hopefully the rest of Europe and the world will see this and make the right desicions when thinking about relaxing certain rules.
5896,"I mean, what did they expect, by having people partying untested with a not yet working vaccination."
5897,But the CFR should be similar to the previous estimate in the unvaccinated population.
5898,[removed]
5899,"And I quote: 

""why wouldn't you use them rather than a known propaganda supplier?"""

5901,Come on man!
5902,Can't quit while you're ahead now.
5903,"To be fair, using a percentage of _doses_ rather than percentage of _vaccinated individuals_ is also misleading, since we each take two doses (with a potential booster coming)."
5904,This is why I don‚Äôt want to take my children anywhere on a plane.
5905,"Everybody exposed on that plane should seek compensation for their tests, quarantine, and infection if found positive."
5906,"I agree the restrictions were dropped waaaaay too soon, and many data scientists already saw this coming before that time, but the number of people ""cheating the system"" cannot explain it all."
5907,"There is the fact that a test could be 40 hours old when you enter a venue, lots can happen in between."
5908,There is the fact that the *Minister of Health* told everyone that they could take the Janssen vaccine and go to the club on the same day.
5909,"I think both government and advisory organizations OMT, and public health institution RIVM are completely out of touch with the reality of how people behave, already before loosening restrictions you saw mask mandates being ignored, and people sitting close together in cafes and restaurants with little ventilation."
5910,"To be fair they might be German, Belgian, Luxembourgian or French and still not have traveled further than many people in the US just to get to the other side of the same state."

5913,I was pro covid vaccine until I got it.
5914,"Here I am, 3 months later, still dealing with vertigo and inflammatory nerve issues."
5915,"For those who don't have an adverse reaction, it is easy to say the benefit outweighs the risk."
5916,why even test at the Olympics?
5917,at this point  any athlete who doesn't get vaxxed made a business decision not to.
5918,it's no longer a health and safety issue

5930,God fucking damn it I was just about to get Moderna too
5931,The county with the highest vaccination rate in Illinois is Dupage at 57%.
5932,The next 5 most populous counties are all right around 50%.
5933,Chicago alone has over 1 million unvaccinated people in a 234 sq mile area.
5934,"I‚Äôm not nearly as worried about Fayette county with their 24% vaccination rate which comes out to about 20,000 unvaccinated folks spread out over 700 square miles."
5935,"Illinois‚Äô 47% vaccination rate is 100% being driven by Cook, Lake, Will, and Kane counties"
5936,"It's not that they're dumb, they're scared."
5937,We shouldn't berate people for being worried about a vaccine or medicine.
5938,Headlines like this also don't help.
5939,Yes!
5940,Also stronger immunity in summer.
5941,Better spike now than in autumn.
5942,We will see how many hospitalizations be in a week.
5943,I guess it will be a minor peak.
5944,"&gt; is nowhere near it was at its peak (~15,000/day) in January."
5945,"It is much nearer to that peak now than it was in February, March, April."
5946,"May, or June."
5947,So we have to go back to one of the worst periods in Florida  Florida and Georgia both appear to have peaked in January.
5948,Other states have been at different times.
5949,Alabama was December.
5950,Massachusetts was earlier too.
5951,&gt;Would you agree with this?
5952,Yes.
5953,Yeah especially for higher risk people.
5954,Which is what France is recommending now and what Scott Gottlieb(on Pfizer board and former FDA) said will most likely happen here
5955,Why not just mandate vaccination and be done with it?
5956,Masks were great before we had the cure.
5957,"We now have the cure, if you're going to encourage/recommend/mandate anything - you mandate the cure - not the mitigation."
5958,You don't even understand your own god damn point.
5959,Here is also heart burn or costochondritus that feel similar
5960,"An addition to this very clear answer: people were allowed to go into nightclubs untested _immediately_ after their second or Janssen vaccination, instead of waiting for the two week working window."
5961,Same thing happened in Europe last summer.
5962,And by fall they were back in lockdown mode again...
5963,I actually think going without a mask the last few weeks is how I caught it.
5964,I live in a decently dense city.
5965,If something is going around and people aren't covering their faces then it makes sense I get it eventually.
5966,Kinda like the flu.
5967,The problem is not only the government but the people too seem to not care.
5968,"I have seen people say covid is a scam, a coverup for a fraud, or they haven't seen anyone die from it."
5969,It's just stupid people it's so frustrating to see these kind of people
5970,Mask works better than no mask.
5971,You don't need N95.
5972,That‚Äôs horrible.

5976,Been dealing with this since my first shot too and feeling crazy.
5977,I went to the ER because I thought I was dying but they said I was fine ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
5978,"Basically most of the infections are at the &lt;25yrs old, who are not yet vaccinated."
5979,They needed a negative PCR test to go clubbing or to a bar.
5980,"Many of the current positive numbers are asymptotic carriers, so without the bars and clubs open would not have shown up in our numbers."
5981,"(And lots of youngsters cheqted with fake PCR testst and our government blundered with allowing freshly vaccinated Janssen people, to go clubbing without waiting for 14 days)
Add to that the superspread events in said clubs/bars and most of our positive cases are related to fun night outs‚Ä¶"
5982,Yeah it‚Äôs ridiculous.
5983,"Another thing I find ridiculous is that I know a few people who during last opening went out to eat 2-3 times a day and always to restaurants for drinks, threw house parties weekly and had multiple family members die."
5984,"They took 0 accountability and justified it with ‚ÄúI‚Äôm young, I should be allowed to live free and have fun‚Äù."
5985,Needless to say I want nothing to do with those people but it still makes my blood boil to see how many people think that way.
5986,"I‚Äôm young too, and I don‚Äôt care too much about myself, but I don‚Äôt want to be the reason my partners family or my elderly colleagues have family members who would suffer because I chose my temporary euphoria over caring about the society."
5987,Sorry for my rant but it just makes my blood boil whenever I get called boring for not wanting to go out or ‚Äúlive free and take risks‚Äù.
5988,Yup this.
5989,I‚Äôll still get a booster if needed but CDC didn‚Äôt want to scare away antivax who would know they‚Äôd need potentially three shots to cover a year.
5990,The CDC probably figured even if they refuse a booster at least they‚Äôd have partial immunity if they still got 1-2 shots.

5992,"The thread in total yes, but not this comment chain."

6015,We‚Äôve had real world studies for a while.
6016,Neutralization tests are useful but definitely not the best or only thing we‚Äôve had.
6017,"&gt; Totally, do you disagree with the links I provided in the section you quoted?"
6018,"I wouldn‚Äôt say I ‚Äúdisagree‚Äù with them (although one of them is ‚ÄúVeryWellHealth‚Äù and not a scientific journal so I tend to not pay attention to them), but I just think it‚Äôs important to note that they‚Äôre not real world numbers, just Petri dish tests."
6019,"&gt; If you have a suggestion for how to reword that section

Personally I would say that the merit of the vaccines stands on it‚Äôs own, and doesn‚Äôt really need comparison to natural infection immunity, since I think most rational people would prefer vaccination over natural infection to begin with."
6020,"But what I have a problem with, when it comes to that section, is that it strongly suggests that vaccination induces stronger immunity than natural infection, with the possibility left open that they are simply ‚Äúsimilar‚Äù."
6021,"In the face of real world results where sometimes zero reinfections are found, or 99% reduction of symptomatic disease is found, it seems misleading to state the information this way when the vaccines are certainly not 100% or 99% effective against symptomatic disease."
6022,"Granted, these are *some* results and not *all* of them, so they are still open to interpretation, but if it were me, I would feel bad writing that sentence the way you did without noting the possibility that vaccine induced immunity may actually fall short of natural immunity, and studies attempting to find real-world benefits of vaccination after natural infection have often come up short."
6023,No it isn't.
6024,Hospitalization risk only dropped a few percentage points.
6025,Isreal didn't even seem tonthinknthere was much a drop.
6026,It's the complete prevention of infection that dropped like 25%.
6027,"You are much more likely to still catch delta if vaccinated, but barely more likely to have a severe case."

6266,California has had some of the fewest infections and deaths per capita in the US especially among large states with at least 10 million population.
6267,The only large state with less deaths per capita is NC based off worldometers.
6268,California has done a good job so far relative to the rest of the US.
6269,Therefore it has to vaccinate a much higher percentage because it lacks the natural immunity in many other states.
6270,50% in LA county is awful considering the vaccine has been available for quite some time.

6277,"I've now seen multiple reports that it can affect 30% or more, even for milder cases."
6278,That strategy is going to backfire spectacularly.

6281,"The original mRNA vaccines are still pretty effective at preventing infections period, and highly effective at preventing severe disease."
6282,"From Pfizer's profit-motivated perspective, it's good to take a ""belts-and-suspenders"" approach and push out booster doses tailored to the variants."
6283,"But from the CDC's public health perspective, asking the population to get a vaccine every six months, one that knocks people on their asses for 1-3 days, probably is not workable."

6690,You've incorrectly correlated personally not wanting to take the vaccine to assuming they think it's overall a bad idea

6698,"My boss is in her third trimester of a high risk pregnancy and had an appointment with a new high-risk OB last week (new to her AND the only one within 3 hours driving distance), NO ONE else was wearing a mask but her."
6699,"Not a receptionist, not a nurse, not another provider, not a doctor."
6700,"If she hadn‚Äôt literally been waiting 3 months for this appointment (for some important fetal testing), I think she would‚Äôve burned the building down as soon as she saw."
6701,She can‚Äôt get vaccinated until after the baby is born and came home in an absolute panic.

6708,"Its not going to up and vanish one day ""like a miracle"", nor are we going to completely vaccinate it out of existence."
6709,"We had tens of millions of swine flu infections and after a period of time the government just said ""fuck it"" and stopped counting cases."
6710,"As long as hospitalization numbers are manageable, there's no reason to believe that we won't be able to get through this just fine."
6711,"For those that are vaccinated, any breakthrough infections should be entirely mild, if not asymptomatic altogether."
6712,"For the unvaccinated adults, this will just serve as another reminder to get it done."
6713,Researchers have been studying and working with mRNA vaccines for decades.
6714,Interest has grown in these vaccines because they can be developed in a laboratory using readily available materials.
6715,"This means the process can be standardized and scaled up, making vaccine development faster than traditional methods of making vaccines."
6716,"mRNA vaccines have been studied before for flu, Zika, rabies, and cytomegalovirus (CMV)."
6717,Smh
6718,"If you do get a strong response after shot 2, you probably didnt have covid."
6719,Its also possible you just dont get  a strong response at all.
6720,Everybody reacts differently and if you dont feel any side effects you shouldnt take it as a sign that the vaccine isnt working.

6722,Just wait 2 weeks.
6723,It's gonna be crazy.
6724,Just like that post Super Bowl surge!

6726,There‚Äôs a wide gulf between supposed to be and reality.
6727,"Because you had covid 2 months ago, your body is already primed to respond to it."
6728,"So when you got he vaccine, your immune system thought ""hey i know what this is"" and directly kicked into gear to fight off (what it thinks is) another infection."
6729,I.e.
6730,"having a reaction to the vaccine is a good sign, its your body doing the work to increase your defenses against the virus."
6731,The government isn't mandating anyone to get the vaccine.
6732,"&gt;The problem is unvaccinated folks are keeping the virus around for longer than it should have, which becomes a concern when vaccinated people's protections start to wane and they become vulnerable."
6733,"I hate to say it, but it fits so well here...

\^This  

I have realized this, and I'm getting pissed at all the knuckleheads that are letting this thing linger."
6734,Especially for the people who are legit medically unable to get the vax.
6735,"Like, they're counting on us collectively for that sweet [herd immunity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity), but they are being failed."
6736,"And then *we'll* be failed, when our protection subsides and that damned virus is still around when we should have beaten it back much more severely."
6737,A real shame.
6738,I'm sorry but I don't understand that at all.
6739,"If it's 95% effective at preventing hospitalisations compared to control, then hospitalisations will be 95% lower, it's literally the sentence."
6740,You are probably more likely to get killed by gun violence in the US if you are under 40 and yet people are more paranoid about COVID.
6741,The hysteria these days is odd.
6742,I blame the media.
6743,"And as somebody who‚Äôs spent a boatload of time with RTs over the last two weeks, that pisses me off."
6744,"The last thing I want is to catch something off somebody giving me a breathing treatment, especially since I‚Äôm already really fragile and covid right now would probably be enough to finish the job."

6750,Just turn off the news.
6751,"It's no good for you: it seems like relevant information, but it's useless since you can't do anything about it."

6760,Straight up maddening.
6761,You require proof of vaccination or you keep the masks.
6762,It should be that fucking simple.
6763,Those are the only two recommendations that make an ounce of sense.

6765,\*facepalm
6766,I would wait a couple days before deciding you won‚Äôt get any additional side effects.
6767,My moderna ones hit about 12 hours after
6768,&gt;I thought most of the flu vaccine allergies were due to it being cultured in egg proteins.
6769,"I could have sworn I read something on this sub months ago that suggested allergies to the mRNA vaccines were far more rare and there was no common contraindications (egg allergies are fairly common, i.e."
6770,there were uncommon ones).
6771,"AFAIK, thats likely true."
6772,It‚Äôll be harder to control than it was in 2020 because a lot of people are behaving as if the pandemic is over and we‚Äôre in the all-clear.
6773,Messaging from the government isn‚Äôt helping with that perception either.
6774,Outside of some rich countries.
6775,"Most of us simply don't have vaccines available to us, it is nothing to do with conspiracy theories."
6776,A mandate does not allow you to sue for something that happened before it lol tf are you talking about
6777,"I don't know, why would businesses want the end of home office?"
6778,"It's convenient for them, they save a ton of money."
6779,"And it can be an excuse to cut salaries in due course, if it were to go on."
6780,The CDCs ineptitude is utterly maddening.
6781,Masks should‚Äôve been recommended from the jump and should stick around until this shit is over.
6782,This is simple stuff.
6783,Their attempts of manipulating the public is pathetic and a failure.
6784,Your takeaway from me laughing at your comment is that I‚Äôm an anti-vaxxer?
6785,Lmao.
6786,"I don‚Äôt want ‚Äúmild‚Äù covid, so I‚Äôm happy to take a booster."
6787,"If people with two doses are fine with getting ‚Äúmild‚Äù covid, missing work (and pay) for two weeks, and scaring everyone around them, that‚Äôs their choice."
6788,Most people are choosing their comfort level from no vax to max vax.
6789,Picking your place on the spectrum seems fair enough to me.
6790,Not true.
6791,Even more people experience it aftermild symptoms
6792,"It will help with the hospitalizations and deaths, which is the point."
6793,[deleted]
6794,"Not really, cancelling all events, after promising they wouldn't, and shutting all disco's, but still no masks anywhere and everything else goes on as normal."
6795,Still no work-at-home advisory either.
6796,It's despicable.
6797,Ive read that j&amp;j is the most effective against delta.
6798,Not sure if that‚Äôs factual but I did read it somewhere with credibility.
6799,I remember someone mentioning this to me all the way back in January 2020.
6800,It was the main reason I started buying face masks.
6801,"Don't worry, we laugh at you anti-vaxxers too."
6802,I want my booster asap.
6803,"I don‚Äôt trust fauci, the CDC, none of em."
6804,And they shut down again tomorrow.
6805,"Of course, it's probably 80-90% by now."
6806,"The CDC estimates are always behind by weeks, but latest data has almost all samples in the US positive for delta."
6807,Are the vaccines not helping?
6808,Do they work against this virus?
6809,"Or are most people Not vaccinated,?"
6810,There are jet injectors that solved the problems of the earlier models but needles can be administered so easily that they do that instead.
6811,What I've learned in the last 2 years is that people are simply stupid or naive or both.
6812,They want to party and if the gov says so people do so.
6813,So don't blame the stupid.
6814,Blame the gov haha
6815,"Cases doubling each week, or more than that, was one of the reliable signs of runaway infection rate in 2020."
6816,Obviously if this rate of increase continues we will have more than 50 times as many cases in 2 months.
6817,"Preferably 15% of assets, because ""income"" can be misled."
6818,Lol.
6819,"I honestly hate ""party factoids""."
6820,They stick in people's heads and take twenty-fold time and effort to put the perspective behind it.
6821,"For example, London is perceived as a huge city by modern people, but around 1100 it had less population than Rome - at the lowest point for latter since the fall of Roman Empire."
6822,Constantinople around 1100 was 25-35 times bigger.
6823,Babylon was \~10 times bigger when it was at its best (and that's a level of development NA cultures peaked around).
6824,Stop.

6827,"In my area, CVS allows you to select either PCR or Rapid test appointments."
6828,"Even if no one in the Netherlands would be vaccinated at all, you wouldn't see any kind of spike yet because the infections numbers have only skyrocket for a few days so far and hospitalizations are always a bit delayed."
6829,Look at the hospitalization number in a few weeks and you can see what the current vaccination rate in the Netherlands helps to prevent or not prevent.
6830,I read recently that older people are massively over-represented in the vaccinated population in the UK.
6831,"In other words they (properly) put their effort into vaccinating older people first, though only about half the overall population is fully vaccinated, as in the US."
6832,"Since older people are most likely to die from covid, they are seeing a pretty low death rate in the UK even as the Delta variant spreads."
6833,"The picture is quite different in the US,  as the vaccinated population tends to be more diverse, and there are plenty of older people who are currently unvaccinated even though the overall percentage of vaccinated people is similar to the UK."
6834,The implication is that the Delta variant is going to hit the US population harder as far as number of deaths is concerned.
6835,"Obviously, we all hope that's not true, but there are reasons for thinking it."
6836,Vaccines are not available for everyone worldwide yet.
6837,Even in Europe people are still on the waiting list in several countries due to shortages
6838,"I don't know about you, but I thought the global year long lockdown was just for fun."
6839,I‚Äôm so glad I‚Äôm not at risk of contracting a deadly virus every time I go see a doctor.
6840,Voluntary mask usage is always a thing.
6841,Schools cant tell you not to wear  a mask.
6842,We had a girl wearing a mask since January 2020 because she heard about it from China (which man did she end up being right)
6843,[removed]
6844,You know after I wrote this out I don't even know anymore.
6845,"I was going off the quote in the article that said that the CDC was not going to provide ""guidance on how teachers can know which students are vaccinated or how parents will know which teachers are immunized."""
6846,So once again the CDC is just punting the problem.
6847,"Traditionally, I'd think vaccine records would be kept in nurse's offices to protect privacy but I'm just a dummy on the internet and have no idea."
6848,What percentage of schools in US actually closed after reopening?
6849,"The past year I worked in an restaurant type club that literally had no precautions and didn't care about masks, I would be shocked if I didn't have covid at one point, but after my 1st dose I was fine, I have my 2nd in a few days"
6850,Went up today (196-&gt;206)
6851,[removed]
6852,[deleted]
6853,Correct until covid happened and student stopped recieving those key things in the IEP including physical therapy
6854,Are you implying people are wearing masks inside clubs in NYC but not in Amsterdam and that‚Äôs the issue?
6855,You must realize how ridiculous that sounds right?
6856,Would the side effects of a booster shot be far worse if it's generating that many antibodies?
6857,The second one really doesn't seem pleasant for many already.
6858,Hospitals are under staffed and holding tight to any employees they have.
6859,It's a hard decision for administration to make; even a nurse who doesn't trust vaccines is a warm body to take a few shifts a week.
6860,I expect more hospitals will start to lean this way now that a couple are doing it.
6861,I live in a republican stronghold but a nearby hospital system just announced that all employees will be required to have their vaccine in the next 2 months; I expect that my hospital system will follow their lead.
6862,I'd like to think it's saved me from getting hospitalized or even death.
6863,"I'm surprised I was able to make it 15 months before vaccination and not get it, at least I don't think I ever got it."
6864,Now I feel protected from anything long term or worse happening to me or my family who are also vaccinated.
6865,"I suspect that one thing governments were thinking about is the idea that Boris Johnson has been tactless enough to say out loud: it's better to have the ""exit wave,"" the wave that inevitably comes after lifting restrictions, in summer than in fall."
6866,"Everyone had a wave in 2020 when the weather got cold, and the idea perhaps was to avoid the seasonal effects on COVID spread."
6867,"In theory, this gamble might still work out if they can get the wave over with by September, but if there is one thing that seems clear now, it's that we don't necessarily get to decide when waves happen, and having a wave now is no guarantee of not having a bigger one later."
6868,Those are the students we sent back first because otherwise they arent recieving OT and PT which is massively important than them.
6869,"Our students with the most serious health issues (ie completely non verbal, wheel chair bound etc) were in person the entire school year without exception."
6870,DOs are just as doctor as MDs
6871,"Yeah so where i live, BC, Canada, the gov't recently moved to a new phase."
6872,Outdoor festivals have no restrictions.
6873,"Indoor at 50 max or 50% of capacity, whichever is higher."
6874,"Masks not required but recommended, especially for undervaccinated."
6875,"What will likely happen is there will be a blossoming of cases as we are at 78% at least one dose, 30% fully vaccinated i think."
6876,Have to wait another week.
6877,So far it's stable but it could take off.
6878,"I think the CDC ""followed the science"", but completely ignored the dynamics of schools and the psychology of school kids."
6879,California is still going to require masks for everyone and I think California got it right this time on the best way to protect school kids from COVID-19.
6880,"First, you are going to have kids who have seen Trump and other influencers running around without masks who'll question why do they need to wear masks or get vaccinated (ignoring the fact that Trump got very, very sick from COVID-19 because he refused to wear a mask, plus later he very quietly got vaccinated)."
6881,"Second, you'll have two groups of students, masked and unmasked, with the masked students basically signaling to everyone their parents are anti-vax, anti-mask very likely strongly conservatives."
6882,Or more likely you'll have a large cohort of unvaxxed students also refusing to wear masks.
6883,Which will guarantee lots of schools will be the sources of COVID-19 outbreaks in the Fall.

6886,That‚Äôs where you‚Äôre wrong.
6887,"If your ‚Äúright‚Äù is putting others peoples‚Äô life in danger then no, you are not entitled to that right."
6888,"You want to live in a civilized society with all the benefits, you respect the rules and don‚Äôt endanger the others."
6889,"If you‚Äôre not fine with that, like I said you can go live somewhere in the woods by yourself like a caveman, and nobody‚Äôs forcing you to vaccinate you will just not be able to enjoy the said benefits."
6890,My problem is that these guidelines sound like excuses for everyone to throw safety measures out the window.
6891,Why not push something like voluntary mask use?
6892,And how many people actually go in for testing?
6893,"Finally, someone who thinks about the shareholders."

6946,This is primarily used to identify potential topics to further investigate with regards to vaccine reactions.
6947,"However, because the event data in VAERS is often not verified and is often self-reported, it should not be assumed that the adverse events in VAERS are actually associated with or cause by the vaccines, nor is it possible to estimate the frequency of these adverse events from these data."

6954,It's the pro-union people who support vaccinations so I don't think this will create more anti-union sentiment than there already is.
6955,The difference here is that some COVID vaccines are using never before used mRNA vaccine tech...so it's not logical to compare them to any other vaccine.
6956,Plus we're still gathering data and learning of complications and severity each day.
6957,Just pointing that out.
6958,Those unwilling to get vaccinated in this country are not the biggest problem.

6967,I worked in an office building where the first floor was a vaccine clinic.
6968,"Per CDC guidelines, we were a healthcare facility and had to socially distance and wear masks even though we had a separate (different floor) entrance and no one on the first floor was allowed beyond security."

7159,I don't trust any news from anyone about covid.
7160,Regardless I don't see the reason to lockdown
7161,You're right that they were performed at different times but there is STRONG evidence that the mRNA vaccines have higher efficacy overall.
7162,"J&amp;J trials took place when the alpha variant was starting to take hold, and it had an efficacy rate in the 60s in most places with the alpha variant."
7163,"Real world studies have looked at how effective mRNA vaccines are against Alpha, and found it to be about 90%."
7164,"Even against Delta, mRNA vaccines have an efficacy rate in the 80s against infection, so it's extremely likely that J&amp;J's efficacy is still significantly lower."
7165,That was without vaccines.
7166,I asked about the Netherlands because I didn't know how long they had been available and to which age groups.

7180,"same thing that‚Äôs been in some other studies, you need both doses of vaccine in order to be protected but it is a high rate of protection"
7181,Prob the Euro cup caused those superspreader events
7182,This study found that  some antibodies from previous infections or vaccinations were less effective against the Delta variant than the Alpha variant.
7183,"What that actually means for real world risk of infection or reinfection is unclear, but it could imply Delta can break through some immune systems that were resistant to Alpha."
7184,"Seems like the delta variant escaped antibodies from a prior covid infection or a single dose of vaccine, but two doses of vaccine still generated neutralizing antibodies."
7185,"Somebody correct me if I interpreted that incorrectly, I read it pretty quickly on my phone."
7186,The reason people such as myself respond to this is because the majority of people won't read the article and only the headline.
7187,There are people freaking out in these very comments about how they're fucked and they can't believe how they've been duped when in reality it's an incredibly limited risk.
7188,This isn't something that should tip people into not getting the vaccine.
7189,About 2/3 of the country is not fully vaccinated.
7190,Great question.
7191,"From what I've come to understand, this is a typical process when a new pathogen reaches humans."
7192,We are very antibody naive to this strain as a population.
7193,"Once we develop antibodies in the community, spread will slow down."
7194,"If we do a great job, it will be rare like the measles."
7195,"If we don't, it will become more seasonal like the flu (more likely), depending on how long antibodies last."
7196,"But, this was the first time in history we have abilities to combat a new pandemic."
7197,"Some would say the damage by our response was worse than the traditional ways, but I this virus would have caused tremendously more damage if it occured 200 years ago."
7198,"The problem is the more people have it are mixing, even with minimal symptoms, the more likely we are to see another variant evolve."
7199,Delta is at least slowed by large scale vaccinations (well after the 2nd dose and 2 weeks at least) but a new variant at this stage could mean even less effectiveness.
7200,"Politics v science v public welfare is difficult balance, even before you take into account a population ready to throw off all caution for a good time and businesses needing to make money again."

7208,"Add boosters and they start parroting the ""just like the flu shot that doesn't work"" garbage."
7209,Subscription only model
7210,"I've heard your rhetoric several times in the past year... without exception, it was from people who either don't believe there is a pandemic at all, or that think ""God will take care of me"" so science-based restrictions have no place."
7211,I hope you aren't one of those...
7212,Your comment is slightly misleading too though.
7213,"The cases are not evenly distributed across ages, the risk is significantly higher for young males."
7214,"Wait, we aren't suppose to sleep all night?"
7215,most of those weren't what caused the spread tho... that is the stupid part... if u look at the regions which had the greatest number of cases: maharashtra etc there was no elections or pilgrimage there...
7216,"&gt; At some point, we have to let people make their own risk calculation and move on with our lives."

7271,It's unfortunate that none of the countries that were highly effective against containing Covid-19 up until now were able to avoid complacency about the need to get their population vaccinated.
7272,I was a bit puzzled by the quick negative reaction to Pfizer's booster plans.
7273,"Even if they do think boosters won't be needed, ""it's better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it""."

7275,Let's be more proactive for once.

7290,"&gt;crop rotation wasn't known in Europe so much as it was known that certain fields needed to be left fallow for a year or so while weed crops we're grown

Two- and three-fields systems are literally modes of a crop rotation."
7291,"And not like Indians had any better knowledge of soil chemistry, so no reason to blame Europeans for ""just knowing to leave it alone""."
7292,"&gt;They also had the ""three sisters"" method of planting where corn, beans and squash were grown side by side as permaculture, which kept the soil productive while still providing a complete diet."
7293,"For one, this method also doesn't work with any kind of mechanization (plowing with domesticated animals included), so it's a dead-end for a large-scale agriculture."
7294,"&gt;They used animals that North America didn't have, and fertilized with their feces."
7295,So?
7296,They domesticated and used them.
7297,America had llamas used for moving burdens for quite some time (since you insist on mentioning potato that has little to do with NA).
7298,&gt;They didn't need it.
7299,So?
7300,"They didn't, and the overall development of agriculture went the other way."
7301,Looks like having low population density and high yield cultures helps to not need stuff.
7302,&gt;North Americans were using cover crops before Europeans showed up.
7303,"We don't know for sure how long before, but it was before."
7304,Would be really nice to get a good source on it.
7305,"For one, growing beans as cover crops after growing beans as a part of ""three sisters"" looks strange."
7306,"&gt;Wild corn is garbage

So?"
7307,Wild apples are small and sour.
7308,Wild olives are nowhere near the one you get in a shop nowadays.
7309,"Wild wheat looses grains easily, and domestication included making it sturdier, so you do not end up with half of the harvest left in the field (people literally had to fight the way it plants itself)."
7310,&gt;Potatoes were straight up poison before native Americans fixed them.
7311,"If I remember correctly, tubers of the wild potato are relatively edible and were even consumed raw (and for sure - when properly cooked), so it wasn't ""a deadly plant turned into a miraculous food""."
7312,A good reason why the tuber is the only part we consume nowadays.
7313,"&gt;Wild and/or ancestral wheats such as bulgar, spelt, farro and others are perfectly edible and are sold in the wheat aisle of your grocery store."
7314,"They're slightly less productive than mainstream varieties, but they're more flavorful and tend to be more disease resistant."
7315,I don't think people ever domesticated something really poisonous just to eat it.
7316,"Either it was already at least partially edible, or it was domesticated for other needs and then found to be good to eat it."
7317,"After all, the green part of potato (the most poisonous one in the wild) is still not used much."
7318,"And I hope you understand all of those listed are domesticated species (just less optimized), and bulgur is not even a grain - it's a dish made of wheat."
7319,&gt;Houses and boats were not particularly important to them.
7320,"When they were, they did amazing things, but for the most part they didn't build permanent structures and they didn't need boats to go beyond a couple miles from shore."
7321,Amazing for prehistoric people - maybe.
7322,But even by means of Ancient Egypt and Babilonia it's not really impressive.
7323,Again pretty normal for Neolithic people.
7324,It also says a lot about the level of your trade and travel when you do not use boats much while having access to huge waterways.
7325,&gt;Did any European in north America know any of that shit?
7326,Did any doctor in most major cities?
7327,"They were bounced between academics and philosophers, but were incredibly obscure."
7328,Luzzi's book was used for training doctors.
7329,"So yes, chances were good."
7330,"As for a germ theory, between ""someone knows and supports it"" and ""have no idea"" Europe is a clean winner."
7331,"&gt;Would you rather be treated by a 17th century medieval barber, or a 17th century native American herbalist?"
7332,"Because sure, herbalism was understood by some in Europe, but weren't practiced by many because those who practiced it were often burned as witches."
7333,Medicine was kept down for centuries in Europe by classism and Christianity.
7334,"It should've been better, but it wasn't."
7335,Now this one is just some gibberish.
7336,Monks openly practicing herbalism for centuries were burned as witches?
7337,Folk medicine was punished so much it survived until modern times?
7338,Europe had medical universities for hundreds of years by the time of Columbus!
7339,By 17th century botany was an integral part of medical knowledge!
7340,"And this knowledge was constantly expanding based on what European contacts worldwide brought up - for one, a treatment for malaria (an Old World disease) was found in Peru in said 17th century by a trained European apothecary."
7341,"*The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp* is a 17th century picture (which, by the way, is done on a technical level impossible for any culture of NA at that time."
7342,Yet another thing Europe was a few millennia ahead).
7343,"It doesn‚Äôt, but most older people are vaccinated."
7344,"I'm not from the UK or US myself, but in the US isn't there significant regional variation in vaccination uptake?"
7345,"So even if older people are well-vaccinated when averaging across the whole country, aren't there still regions where the vaccination rate among older people is lower?"
7346,And clustering of un-vaccinated together likely amplifies the problem.
7347,[removed]
7348,No no not just students.
7349,Students who are in direct contact with vulnerable people twice a week for twelve hours at a time.
7350,Many of the patents have COVID.
7351,I totally agree they absolutely do not belong in medicine
7352,I think ya got it backwards there bud.
7353,"African Americans, Native Americans, Asian Americans, Italian American, Indian Americans."
7354,"notice how they're all Americans, and that their country of origin serves as an adjective, as to say what kind of American they are."
7355,&gt;American Indian would be for peoples who immigrated to the U.S. from India.
7356,Its actually you that is suggesting to put the country of origin second by saying that American Indians are American citizens from India.
7357,"following such a naming convention as this would lead to such bassackwards terms as ""American Africans."""
7358,&gt;you're fucking stupid.
7359,you typed that whole comment up and thought you were justified enough to call me fucking stupid?
7360,One glaring issue in the current strategy is that essential travelers must quarantine 14 days before getting a vaccine upon entry into Canada.
7361,Canada should be vaccinating on arrival.
7362,Canadians returning from abroad are waiting unnecessarily for their first dose.
7363,It could easily be done at arrival airports.
7364,"I understand the quarantine, but get these jabs out right away."
7365,Some places are showing only 55% for the first dose and 45% fully vaccinated.
7366,Which isn‚Äôt not too good compared to other states.
7367,[removed]
7368,I‚Äôm probably biased because I work on covid response in my state; but I don‚Äôt treat the pandemic as over despite being vaccinated.
7369,But I also have different circumstances than other people so I wouldn‚Äôt fault someone else who is vaccinated going back to normal.
7370,"The Florida government absolutely MUST devalue life and downplay the threats of coronavirus, as if the freedom of the politicians who purvey these horrendous lies was at stake."
7371,They must continually outdo themselves else their evil becomes evident.
7372,The authorities looking the other way while this mass negligent murder happens should be ashamed of themsleves.
7373,"Hey you all, stop science; this guy has all the answers."
7374,He knows hundreds of people who got covid and has all the answers smh.
7375,If you‚Äôre simply just wanting to lose weight there‚Äôs nothing wrong with going outdoors for a run or playing outdoor sports with a friend (unless you live in a hot hellhole like I do).
7376,"If you‚Äôre looking to build muscle AND lose weight then there‚Äôs not
many consistent alternatives to a gym."
7377,"I personally know someone who‚Äôs been going to a gym unvaccinated for months and hasn‚Äôt caught COVID as far as I or anyone else that knows him knows (yet, knock on wood), so I‚Äôd say you shouldn‚Äôt have much to worry about if you are vaccinated."
7378,My only advice would probably be to research your options maybe don‚Äôt go to any gym ran by Anti-Vax idiots (because they‚Äôll attract likeminded people) and find a time where the gym isn‚Äôt as heavily used in order to mitigate whatever little risk there is
7379,They'll say that's the earth's magnetism pulling you down.
7380,Lots of nations would do swap deals.
7381,That makes zero sense.
7382,We mix vaccines time to get a booster
7383,I realize that.
7384,"So the idea is that as long as they are ok at home, Australia doesn‚Äôt owe any duty to its citizens?"
7385,Olympic athletes will take epo.
7386,Break rules.
7387,"Carry pee around to try and win gold

But want take a vaccine"
7388,"Yeah, that article actually directly contradicts the study it's citing."
7389,Japan has a pretty severe anti-vaxxer problem so it's probably not the best example.
7390,"A lot of the pharmaceutical industry is very international so that also masks the contributions of different countries to vaccine developments, whereas this globalisation isn't so present in less developed countries which are developing their own vaccines, hence why they're continuing development where others have stopped or changed focused to more advanced vaccines."
7391,"**[COVID-19_vaccine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_vaccine)** 
 
 &gt;A COVID‚Äë19 vaccine is a vaccine intended to provide acquired immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‚ÄëCoV‚Äë2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‚Äë19)."
7392,"Prior to the COVID‚Äë19 pandemic, an established body of knowledge existed about the structure and function of coronaviruses causing diseases like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)."
7393,This knowledge accelerated the development of various vaccine technologies during early 2020.

7396,"The study they quote concludes:

""¬†Preliminary findings did not show obvious safety signals among pregnant persons who received mRNA Covid-19 vaccines."
7397,"However, more longitudinal follow-up, including follow-up of large numbers of women vaccinated earlier in pregnancy, is necessary to inform maternal, pregnancy, and infant outcomes."""

7602,This is primarily used to identify potential topics to further investigate with regards to vaccine reactions.
7603,"However, because the event data in VAERS is often not verified and is often self-reported, it should not be assumed that the adverse events in VAERS are actually associated with or cause by the vaccines, nor is it possible to estimate the frequency of these adverse events from these data."

7606,*
7607,I'm sure for the next 20 years we'll get all sorts of papers from one of the greatest accidental experiments ever run on humans.
7608,Usually good data on certain aspects of human behavior is hard to come by because you can't easily do controlled studies but data people always find a way to get their data.
7609,Like they'll use weird events like mass adoption of Korean children and them going into different families and it being first come first served.
7610,Now imagine how many weird pieces of data this pandemic has generated.
7611,Respiratory therapy students might not be at risk for outcomes but they will be dealing with a patient cohort that absolutely will be!
7612,Vaccination should never have been made into a political issue - we'd be so much further along than we are if it hadn't been.
7613,True despite downvotes
7614,Fair - given way more older people globally have had the vaccine.
7615,"Still, doesn't really matter since the risks are still heavily skewed."
7616,"It's way better to get vaccinated and risk mild inflammation of the heart and go to the hospital to treat it, than let covid spread."
7617,Risks of common over the counter medication are higher and worse and we don't fuss about those - we just warn people on the packaging.
7618,"The people who are driving up the cases, and causing the rise, are people who aren't vaccinated."
7619,"I agree, but I do hope that al the people mindlessly protesting wake up now."
7620,Probably not though...
7621,"August 1st it‚Äôll come out that the Bible Belt, aka the areas with the lowest vax rates, will have a spike in infections/hospitalizations/deaths."
7622,I can‚Äôt predict the numbers.
7623,I don‚Äôt even work with numbers.
7624,But I‚Äôm an educated adult who can read the news.
7625,I‚Äôve follow covid since the beginning.
7626,"I was the one sounding the alarm amongst my friends as Italy and Spain fell hard and fast, and while many Americans thought ‚Äúwell that won‚Äôt happen here‚Äù

So I‚Äôm informed enough to understand that covid, will work like the flu, and will have a natural spike come fall winter anyway."
7627,But combine that with like 70% of certain states populations not being vaxxed.
7628,The information is all right there to connect the dots and realize those states are going to be in a shit ton of trouble especially coming the fall.
7629,And what baffles me is why this knowledge is even downvoted.
7630,Like are you all so triggered by death and bad news you just downvote it?

7642,Not being vaccinated does not put others at risk.
7643,It's mixing with others while not vaccinated which does that.
7644,It's is absolutely your right to not be vaccinated.
7645,"If you stay properly isolated, that's fine."
7646,You wouldn't actually want to lose rights of bodily autonomy if you think about it.
7647,"It affects rights to contraception, abortion, appropriate medical care, tattoos, body mods and so on."
7648,What would we do if it were decided that people have no right to refuse the vaccine?
7649,To enforce it we would have to arrest refusers and administer it by force.
7650,That's completely outside what's acceptable.
7651,"Buuuut... as I said, other people have a right to be protected from antivax cult members."
7652,I think under existing health and safety law businesses have a duty of care to take reasonable steps to protect their service users.
7653,Personally I do think excluding vaccine refusers is a reasonable step.
7654,I hope the courts will agree with me.
7655,The majority of their workers are vaccinated already.
7656,As another poster mentioned the news here is that they are now making it mandatory for all co-workers to be vaccinated or they will lose their job.
7657,"From a public health perspective, you can argue that the safety precautions are a ‚ÄúSwiss cheese method.‚Äù 

You assume every safety precaution has its own limitations (the holes in Swiss cheese) so you stack layers (safety precautions) against one another to reduce the size of the holes that line up."
7658,it is insignificant compared to previous waves.
7659,Last time we had this many cases there were over 10 times as many deaths.
7660,Of course every death is a tragedy but talking as if we are going to witness another huge wave of fatalities is scaremongering.
7661,Virol load.
7662,Also at this point it‚Äôs the unvaccinated who are going to the hospital and dying.
7663,Because people remove their masks during air travel to drink beverages and eat snacks.

7665,Can you specify which consequences?

7707,"Well, I wouldn't say ""fuck society"", but the current Dutch government has made repeated disastrous policy decisions."

7721,"To be fair it is only hugely less effective on the first shot, and on the second less effective against symptomatic infection, but not much less against death and hospitalizations."

7727,"As far as herd immunity is concerned, it's OK if 30% stay unvaccinated."
7728,A large portion of them will develop natural immunity after catching covid (even if they develop long covid).
7729,"If we assume conservatively that half of them go this way, we are at 85% immunity, which is almost the level needed to suppress a disease like measles that is way more infectious than covid."

7808,But a mere 2-3 generations ago the idea of flying across the ocean in a giant metal bird or sending instantaneous messages to anyone in the world via a global communications network were impossible fantasies.

7931,"I guess it's technically still ""life long"" when you die way sooner."
7932,Percentages involving death probably stay the same.

8071,My doc agrees I probably had myocarditis even though I don‚Äôt have any official tests or evidence to prove it.
8072,The vaccine statistics are only using hospital cases/tests which are the severe ones.
8073,"So while it‚Äôs good that it usually isn‚Äôt a severe side effect, just keep in mind there‚Äôs probably a lot more unreported cases like mine because of people doubting me and making me think I was overthinking my symptoms."

8201,The people who have had the cardiac attack in my country were all guys who undoubtedly did intense workout training the same week as they took the jab so its also safe to say that they overworked the body when its already busy trying to deal with the vaccines.

8208,"The people choosing not to get it is driven a lot by US policies and propagandizing, especially the insistence that the pandemic is over even though we have high levels of uncontrolled spread and a lot of unvaccinated people."
8209,"We‚Äôve created a context where people think they can decide that the ‚Äúpandemic is over for them,‚Äù even though the collective consequence of that is worse outcomes for everyone, as is evident from reduced vaccine efficacy as more dangerous variants continuing to spread."
8210,Tldr - vaccine reduces chances of you getting it and spreading it - get that into your head.
8211,Once you bring transmission rate below 1 virus no longer can spread amongst population so your argument about it spreading regardless makes no sense.

8244,"I don't think it's like dangerous just unknown, but not even everyone in Fauci's office was vaccinated when questioned...only roughly half."
8245,"No, I'm right and you've just confirmed it; you can still spread it despite the amount of word salad you use to avoid saying it by coming up with the varying levels of  transmission rate."
8246,"See, it doesn't matter whether the vaccine reduces transmission, that's not the issue as you still spread it regardless."
8247,What matters that it reduces severity and hospitalitisation which is the key to normality.
8248,"So, knowing everyone will still spread it, knowing everyone can still get ill; it makes no sense to use passports."
8249,Why?
8250,1) bodily autonomy.
8251,If you don't want it you shouldn't be forced.
8252,You shouldn't have backdoor discrimination against the unvaccinated.
8253,"2) testing using flawed tests that the manufacturer themselves aren't using because they are so unreliable, is pointless."
8254,You've seen school kids using lemon juice to get a positive result and 10 days off school right?
8255,3) Say an unvaccinated person walks in.
8256,Spreads it.
8257,Those vaccinated will be less likely to be ill with it.
8258,"The unvaccinated is more likely

4) Children under 12 won't be vaccinated."
8259,Even Witty has said they are of little risk and any side effects must outweigh the effects of Covid; but there's no effects of Covid.
8260,So herd immunity will never be achieved and it will always spread.

8383,"While it sucks, it's been manageable with over the counter drugs and bed rest."
8384,I can imagine ending up in the hospital without the vaccine.
8385,The point is that if it‚Äôs only 70% effective against severe regular covid and the other vaccines with high efficacy are less effective against the delta  then the j&amp;j is probably also less effective against severe delta covid.
8386,The icing on the cake is false biontech and moderna are 95 effective against asymptomatic covid and 85 against any covid whatsoever

8440,"Nobody ever is, including home, just think of those people in that Miami building."
8441,Just be aware of realities and I think it is wise to be aware than vaccination does not lead to invulnerability nor should all vaccinated people consider themselves uninfectable.
8442,Not just for their own sake or safety but because they themselves can still be vectors or their demands can be putting othes in danger.
8443,We all live in societies and have duties to them and as well as their behaviour affects our own safety.

8544,It is why we don't see polio outbreaks and why we didn't see measles outbreaks for decades and yet there was an outbreak centered around Disney in California in 2014 due to growing antivax sentiment (almost 40% of the unvaccinated infected kids and adults were due to personal/family beliefs not medical necessity to avoid vaccine).

8582,Can you explain the selective pressure which would prevent a deadlier variant from emerging.
8583,"From a basic evolutionary standpoint, the long presymptomatic contagious period basically eliminates any selective pressure against such a variant."

8585,I suggest you actually talk to an epidemiologist instead of just pretending to have.

8587,Let me introduce you to the GSK H1N1 Pandemrix swine flu vaccine from 2009.
8588,"Roughly 0.009% of vaccinated Swedes shortly developed Narcolepsy, most of them young (440 cases with 5m vaccinated)."
8589,"However, in that case it can be mentioned that the offending virus H1N1/pdm09 had a very low mortality rate of \~0.03% compared to COVID19s \~0.5-1.0%."
8590,Do you think people shouldn't know about it?
8591,Or is your concern more that the media will overexxagerate it?
8592,"Tbh, at this point you're either too young to be particularly affected by COVID or you've had your chance to be vaccinated, unless you're an obese adolescent whose parents dont want you to get it."

8877,"During further testing on July 8 and 9, only four new cases were found among the 4,671 people tested, which indicated a positivity rate of 0.08 percent, he said."
8878,"""Given this improvement in the situation, the CECC decided to close its special command center in the area on Saturday, but testing will continue at the markets next week,"" Chen said."
8879,"Meanwhile, the number of cases in a Delta variant cluster in Pingtung remained at 17 on Saturday, despite widespread testing, which indicated that it was under control, according to Chen."
8880,"Recent tests on 3,033 patients and staff at Fangliao General Hospital, where several of the infections are believed to have occurred, have all been negative, while over 500 of the 600 contacts identified in the cluster have been released from quarantine, Chen said."
8881,"Meanwhile, of the 33 new COVID-19 cases confirmed Saturday, 31 were domestic infections, all in northern Taiwan, and 19 had tested positive while in quarantine, according to the CECC."
8882,"Taipei and New Taipei cities each reported 13 cases, followed by Taoyuan with four cases and Keelung with one, the CECC said."
8883,"Of the domestic cases, 21 had a known source of infection, while two had unknown links to other cases, and eight were under investigation, the CECC said."
8884,"The two imported cases were Taiwan nationals, in their 20s and 30s, who returned from Italy and Belgium in late June and tested positive before the end of their quarantine period, the CECC said."
8885,"It said the six deaths reported Saturday were two men and four women, ranging in age from their 30s to their 80s, who passed away between July 6 and July 8."
8886,"The new cases bring the total number in Taiwan to 15,218, of which some 13,800 are domestic infections reported since May 15, when the country first recorded over 100 cases in a single day."
8887,"The number of deaths in Taiwan from COVID-19 has now risen to 736, including 724 since May 15, CECC data shows."

8977,"Additionally, sC5b9 levels were elevated both in patients who did and did not meet criteria for TMA."

9041,"&gt; but as anyone in epidemiology would tell you, mutated variants are never more fatal,

That's not true, as [this paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2017129) on a mutation in a virus highlights, where it was associated with greater lethality: ""Our study indicates that the new H7N9 mutants are lethal to chickens""

That paper simply shouldn't exist if you were correct about what anyone in epidemiology would say."
9042,"Yeah no, several journalists are digging around and the way the testing for admittance system was set up, allowed a ton of false negatives to enter night clubs before people were vaccinated."

9045,"Floridian here, fully vaxxed and staying masked."
9046,I lost all trust in anything COVID-related put out by the state once Rebekah Jones got canned in late spring 2020.
9047,A quote I read in March 2020 during that last week of working at the office really struck a chord with me (paraphrasing because I'm too lazy to look it up): Precautions taken during a pandemic will seem excessive.
9048,"After the pandemic, those same precautions will seem inadequate."
9049,"Well, if there are two locales, one with a mask mandate and one without..."
9050,I'd rather be in the one with a mask mandate until we see what the effects of no-masks are with delta circulating.
9051,"When I say vaccinated people will be ""fine"", i mean that relatively; we're still learning what the breakthrough rate will be."
9052,"And if the unvaxxed start overloading the hospitals, then when someone who is vaxxed and has a non-covid emergency may not be able to get care."

9070,"Not sure what they are referring to but according to Wikipedia ‚ÄúImmunization is done through various techniques, most commonly vaccination.‚Äù So seeing we have vaccines for COVID I‚Äôm not sure how they can say ‚Äúthere is no immunization against COVID-19‚Äù."

9072,"&gt; Anyone in epidemiology would tell you that when viruses mutate, they may be more contagious, but actually weaken in virulence

That is not a hard-and-fast rule."
9073,"It is often the case, but not always."
9074,The virus has plenty of time to spread before killing the host.
9075,"Also, in a majority of cases, it doesn‚Äôt kill the host."
9076,"With those two factors in play, there is little to no selective pressure to favor less-lethal strains of the virus."
9077,The other reason sometimes given for respiratory viruses to become less lethal as they become more contagious is about what part of the respiratory system they reproduce best in.
9078,Something that favors the lungs is expected to be more dangerous and less transmissible than something that favors the upper respiratory system.
9079,"I have no idea how much evidence there is for this actually happening/shaping viral evolution in general, but even if it is a thing, it probably won‚Äôt apply here."

9094,At least this way if they are positive they won't be risking others.

9108,"Even a non fatal case can have lasting effects, such as making me permanently sterile."
9109,"A vaccine and low community spread, however, makes me much less at risk should I encounter an unvaccinated person who has not previously been infected."
9110,"I was also required by my college to either be vaccinated or prove I had a prior infection, so that actually is a thing already in some places."
9111,"Again, just not the same situation as covid."

9164,"None of that saves lives, it‚Äôs runaway government

9173,Only half of California is fully vaccinated.
9174,Not even close to the 70-80% threshold yet.
9175,It should.
9176,"There are lots of bubbles that are well north of 70% vaccinated at this point, which is why local rules make a ton more sense if localities can be trusted to actually look at local conditions, rather than politics, when making decisions."
9177,Wowüòëüòëüòë
9178,The idea is disease is supposed to win instead?
9179,I don't see any forever 'lockdown.'
9180,"But we have just had a surge of nearly 10,000 infections a day in Florida."
9181,If the state decides not to count visitors how is that going to help tourism?
9182,"If someone comes here and gets sick ""it doesn't count?"""

9184,"&gt; Basically, the rules were dropped too soon."
9185,This is why I'm ignoring the CDC's dropping of mandates and I continue masking up whenever I go out anyway.
9186,Numbers are starting to go up again in my area after a lot of businesses dropped the mask requirement.
9187,If only we could figure out why...

So, they deny COVID?"
9189,What is your solution to this?
9190,"Spain and Portugal are right now, respectively, the 16th and 17th most vaccinated countries in the world (by first dose and excluding countries under 1 million inhabitants)."
9191,"Looking at vaccine uptake statistics per age group until now, I think there is a good chance that in a few weeks they will be 1st and 2nd (not sure which of the two will be first)."
9192,"I also think they might be the first countries to vaccinate 80% of total (yes, not adult or eligible) population."
9193,"This is the ranking so far:

9194,Never though that we needed to consider natural immunity vs getting the vaccine.
9195,Unfortunately you can't consider yourself fully safe as there's always a small risk that you could still get the virus- they're called breakthrough cases.
9196,In my country we've had some cases of people dying from the delta variant even though they were fully vaccinated.
9197,"It's rare, but it can still happen."
9198,"Please do what you can to protect yourself and others, especially around crowds."
9199,"Even if you don't legally have to wear a mask or social distance, consider doing so anyway just in case."
9200,And what are we supposed to feel for those who are against it?
9201,&gt;It is what the numbers say.
9202,The worst period in COVID in Florida was January.
9203,Yes.
9204,That was not disputed at all.
9205,"&gt;And that's the only time where the new infection rate reached near 10,000 per day."
9206,"I am not sure where you are getting the ""near 10,000 per day"" from."
9207,"The highest 7-day average of cases in Florida reached \~18,000 in January ([Source](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/florida-covid-cases.html)), and then began to decrease."
9208,"&gt;The 7-day average never came up to 10,000 during Feb -through June."
9209,"Yes, and neither has July."
9210,"The current 7-day average stands at 3,392, no where near a 7-day average of 10,000."
9211,There is no denial.
9212,&gt;I'm talking about the newest rates that have spiked in alternate days.
9213,The 7 day average will have to wait another 6 to 13 days...
9214,"Okay, we'll have to see."
9215,"There was a raise in cases and spike in April that went to 9,000 one day, but then the 7-day average decreased."
9216,"Again, with the amount of people being vaccinated, and with the vaccines protecting against the Delta variant as well (as I cited in my previous reply)."
9217,I think it is wrong to say Florida is going back to one of the worst periods.
9218,"As in January, the number of people vaccinated is no where near where it is today."
9219,Glad you learned something

9222,Yeah because screw all the guys right?
9223,Is that how you feel?
9224,[removed]
9225,&gt; The first dose of pfizer is still very effective after 3 weeks.
9226,Multiple studies have shown an increase in infection right after the first shot of Pfizer.
9227,The infection drops off over the next of couple of weeks.
9228,The issue is not ‚Äúpeople waited three weeks and got infected anyways‚Äù.
9229,The issue is ‚Äúpeople did zero waiting and acted like they‚Äôre fully vaccinated the day after the first shot‚Äù.
9230,Which is why there‚Äôs an increase in the infection rate on people who got their first shot.
9231,And those numbers are probably low since we know Florida heavily doctored the numbers last year.
9232,"Yeah, we may run into limits soon."
9233,"And to be fair, I believe the true number of infections is already quite a bit higher than the official number."
9234,"Wherever you go you hear people sniffling, sneezing, coughing, which coincidentally are the telltale symptoms of a mild Delta-infection."
9235,"Since it looks so similar to a case of the sniffles, I think a substantial number of infected people won't get tested because they think that's all they have - the sniffles."
9236,I agree.
9237,But it was a choice I made.
9238,I was also part of the trial back in august but was a placebo.
9239,Guess I just live life on the edge lol
9240,&gt; I seem to recall that Delta doesn't cause more deaths or need for mechanical ventilation but that might be outdated.
9241,You recall it from stupid reporting / causation.
9242,People act like its not worse because they look at countries which are vacinated.
9243,Delta is more deadly.
9244,[removed]
9245,They said that too.
9246,They have to try suggesting everything because clearly people aren't listening and hope that some people who won't get vaccinated will at least put the masks back on or avoid crowded places.
9247,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt;‚ÄúWe have seen an entire takeover of the Delta variant for our transmission,‚Äù Dr. Thomas Dobbs, the state health officer, said Friday afternoon."
9248,"The state is asking that:  
All residents over 65 years of age avoid all indoor mass gatherings (regardless of vaccination status)."
9249,All residents with chronic underlying medical conditions avoid all indoor mass gatherings.
9250,All unvaccinated residents wear a mask when indoors in public settings.
9251,**All residents 12 years of age and older receive a Covid-19 vaccination.
9252,"**  
In addition to asking people to get vaccinated as soon as possible and to wear a mask in public until they do, the state is now asking vulnerable people to take extra precautions, Dr. Dobbs said."
9253,Fucking twats won't get vaccinated.
9254,"I haven't checked on it recently, but I remember hearing Delta might be twice as likely to hospitalize."
9255,"However, even if that translates to deaths, and vaccines were only effective at stopping cases not deaths, we'd still expect to see a drop in case fatality rate moving forward."
9256,"If the cases grow at a larger exponent in  the young than the elderly, there's not really a possibility for the case fatality rate to be as high as it used to."
9257,"Young people really really rarely die, compared to how frequently the old people die."
9258,It's like 0.00005 odds.
9259,Ya good.
9260,Good job on getting poked
9261,it is less than half the flu deaths in kids each year...and 1/5  the number of kids that die in car accidents

9274,Also seems like it makes Delta more deadly.
9275,A breakthrough infection happens at the individual level when someone who has been vaccinated gets infected.
9276,At the population level I don't think it's a binary thing.
9277,A decreased efficacy may warrant an updated booster.

9300,The part that stands out as being really stupid to me is that a lot of places are basically fumbling at the finish line for no real reason.
9301,They're dropping restrictions *while vaccination campaigns are still only mid-flight.
9302,"* Plenty of places with reopening criteria like ""50% of eligible adults with 1 dose"" and whatnot."
9303,"It seems to me that the wiser thing to do would be make the major push to reopen after it was more like 70-80% fully vaccinated, which for a lot of these countries is only a couple months away."
9304,"But people are so psychologically invested in *this* summer being ""the back to normal summer"" that they don't want to tolerate another month or two of restrictions while the vaccination rates are ramped up as high as they can go."
9305,Which leads to situations like this.
9306,They think they won‚Äôt get fined then go insane when they finally have consequences to their entitled actions for once in their lives
9307,"If im not doing the vaccine yet because of news like this which means the vaccine is still being ""tested"" , am I a conspiracist antivaxer?"
9308,Oh you were being sarcastic?
9309,Got my second dose yesterday and the mild heart inflammation disturbed my sleep.
9310,"Currently, it‚Äôs less intense then it was yesterday."
9311,Should I relax and just let it pass?
9312,"Yeah that will be the real clincher tbh, though don't underestimate the amount of people getting long covid now."
9313,"I was actually surprised that the high numbers today didn‚Äôt cause a troubles with their systems, as seemed to happen every time we had record cases."
9314,Tomorrow could very well bring a new alltime record of new cases in NL‚Ä¶
9315,[removed]
9316,I'm with you on this.
9317,"It was reasonable to ask young people to pause their lives for a period, in order to prioritize vaccinating the elderly, vulnerable etc., but with vaccination roll-outs being mishandled and vaccine hesitancy dragging things out, it was always going to reach a point where enough would be enough and patience and goodwill would wear thin."
9318,You can be as hygienic as you want.
9319,"You're still at the mercy of the people around you, however."
9320,Health is public.
9321,Some people subconsciously tend to adopt controversial opinions to boost their ego.
9322,Looking for that behavior is a good observable indicator that something's rotten in a person's underlying personality.
9323,"Concluding Paragraph:

Our findings provide early evidence regarding the use of FMT in recurrent CDI in patients with COVID-19."
9324,"Furthermore, these data let us speculate that gut microbiome manipulation may merit further exploration as an immunomodulatory strategy in COVID-19."
9325,"Based on our experience here (and other data demonstrating gut microbiome-immune interactions in humans10), we are progressing to a clinical trial to assess the impact of FMT added to standard COVID-19 treatment on the risk reduction of disease progression (NCT04824222); this should commence recruitment shortly."
9326,Florida only reports on Fridays.
9327,That 10k number is the total new cases over the previous 7 days
9328,"Europe is shutting down again, and again we in the US are going to follow."
9329,"Im talking about later, with 90% vaccinated deaths from vaccinated will be higher vs non vaccinated."
9330,for example: 2 deaths between 90k vaccinated vs 1 death between 10k.
9331,Just check the Israel results for some weeks it was like that.
9332,"That's just basic, normal maths."
9333,A very minimal nuisance at best.
9334,"Of course given the choice and no pandemic going on, I also would not wear it."
9335,"Alas, thats not the case."
9336,"People that outright refuse to wear masks when it is ‚Äòstrongly recommended‚Äô from the scientific community in order to save lives in significant volumes are stupid, or egocentric, or both."
9337,Government is setting for once a policy that IS in our intrest and people still stupidly fight it.
9338,"If there now is a gamma or theta or whatever-variant that originates somewhere in the western world, defeating our vaccines, thats then most likely on the mask refusers and governments that buckle/give in under pressure coming from them."
9339,Covidiots.
9340,I hope this all ends this year.
9341,(Knocks on wood)
9342,It‚Äôs this people need to realize!
9343,Not enough talk about it!
9344,It doesn‚Äôt mean you will die or even get hospitalized but people can 100% till get the virus after being vaccinated you just have a WAY better chance of fighting it off so it doesn‚Äôt replicate enough to do anything but you can still get it and even spread it.
9345,You already have soldiers at the door kinda thing but not always will they stop the attack either aka the ‚Äúbreakthrough‚Äù cases.
9346,It doesn‚Äôt mean be scared but don‚Äôt be stupid and act like the virus doesn‚Äôt exist like a lot do now.... doctors still don‚Äôt know exactly how many antibodies constitute great protection nor completely what causes ‚Äúlong Covid‚Äù and such because we are still figuring it all out so to act like the virus doesn‚Äôt exist anymore and for everyone to talk about the vaccines like it makes you immune is just a false reality which can lead to lots of problems because you act like the reality is not what the actual reality is.
9347,Vaccines great!
9348,But just a tool not a concrete condom over your body that blocks anything from coming into your space.
9349,"If you feel sick even vaccinated, know you could have Covid, it‚Äôs not impossible and it just needs to be wider known information because truth matter even if it doesn‚Äôt mean you need to change things or you do, understanding is key."
9350,Our oldest just moved to Vermont and we love it.

9354,[deleted]
9355,"Honest question, but doesn't having 70%+ of the population vaccinated make some difference?"
9356,"Those odds, to me (and I could be wrong), seem a lot better than when we were in peak COVID last year, variant or not."
9357,Well shit
9358,Hardly arbitrary.
9359,They're intended to protect people.
9360,And not everyone can be elected.
9361,Many of these people were appointed by those who were elected.
9362,"Besides, elected leaders make some of the most arbitrary rules out there."
9363,"For example, trusting school boards to make public health decisions during the pandemic has been insane."
9364,School boards are basically all elected business leaders who are unqualified for that responsibility.
9365,Give me the unelected public health experts all day.
9366,"Lunacy is sanity, conformity is individuality, oppression is liberation."
9367,"Welcome to the 21st century, where very weak men are about to create very hard times."
9368,"Got first vaccine Pfizer, and second dose Moderna."
9369,Had mild fever and recovered in 1.5 days.
9370,Lucky?
9371,"My partner and I live in the north east (NYC) and after this experience with the pandemic, I don't think we'll ever move away from this part of the country."
9372,It's not perfect but over all I've liked how the north east and it's people have handled themselves during the pandemic.
9373,"No, young people can think for themselves and don't want to be coddled and told what to do - at least, that's what they keep telling the world."
9374,There's no excuse after 18 months of pandemic to feign ignorance of the absolute basics of a respiratory virus outbreak.
9375,None at all.
9376,"Lacking critical thinking skills, indifference, having gone through a rough time (like the rest of the population) may be a reason for their irresponsible behavior, but it's not an excuse."
9377,"They are just as much responsible for the current out-of-control dumpster fire as are the bars and clubs who screwed the pooch by letting people in unchecked, through the back door, etc., and of course those worthless fuckmuppets in The Hague."
9378,Most cases come from clubs and local events.
9379,One pub had like 180 cases in a single night.
9380,Flawed method of showing a negative test from &lt;48h ago was enough to enter a club(without distancing) which could be frauded with fairly easy.
9381,Well it's quite logical.
9382,"If nobody in your direct circle of people gets it you aren't adversely affected by it, and they aren't really thinking: let's get vaccinated.. Then odds are you won't either.."
9383,I wonder when masking on transportation will be axed?
9384,That's the one thing holding me back from making any trips to places like NY or Florida.
9385,I do not feel ready to do either of those two things until the mask mandate on transportation is gone.
9386,But I fear they never will.

9416,It's also much less terrifying to believe that someone created it than that nature just  crippled our civilization without even noticing and could do it again anytime.
9417,I don‚Äôt feel like tracking down the link - but it‚Äôs from the UK based app that tracks Covid symptoms - I think it is called Zoe.
9418,Since the UK is experiencing a surge in delta cases and has a much longer wait between vaccine shots you can see the impact of being partially vaccinated on symptoms.
9419,I‚Äôd argue back that the data you want is emerging within the dashboards of countries like Israel and the UK.
9420,It‚Äôs just not been published yet.
9421,"What I wrote about pcr testing is NOT supposition, you can google why some people test positive for Covid weeks after the disease to read about the test picking up RNA fragments."

9427,That's a nightmare.
9428,If anything they are going to come up with COVID-2 to kill off all of the people who didn't get the vaccine so only the people who do what they're told are left.
9429,Not a rebuttal.
9430,Elon musk is incredibly smart.
9431,Was wondering why he would suggest deaths are being over reported.
9432,[removed]
9433,My question is what is considered exceeding normal.
9434,If we say (I'm making up numbers for example sake) have a disease that kills 50k people a year.
9435,If it kills 49800 one year I wouldn't say it seemed to be killing less people wed say that's within error or noise or whatever.
9436,And that's a .4% difference.
9437,117 million vaccines and 283 cases is an incredibly small number.
9438,It is probably higher but than normal but a difference of 100 people at the scale of 100+ million population seems to be something that is hard to account for?
9439,What's the sensitivity to noise if you will.
9440,I'm not a medical doctor I'm an engineer.
9441,"So I could measure the voltage across a component and it can jump around it I add enough zeros but that's noise in the system, randomness, not the component I'm measuring causing an extra fluctuation."

9560,This is for the mRNA vaccines; less efficacy for J&amp;J.
9561,"Also, data from Israel might show lower efficacy because:

1) They started vaccinating earlier than the UK - this could mean decreasing immunity over time

2) They spread out the doses by 3 weeks; in other countries the time between doses was higher."
9562,"This could have something to do with it

3) Israel has fully opened up."

9762,Well that's what the approach they're making in other countries.
9763,I was thinking at least we could require masks indoors.
9764,That's like the bare minimum and a very good bare minimum at preventing spread

9766,I think it‚Äôll take a lot worse than what we‚Äôre going to get before people will comply with lockdown again.
9767,Why did cases suddenly collapse in India at the start of May?
9768,I know they went into lockdown but if the Delta variant is as contagious as everyone says then it doesn't really make sense that two months later cases are still dropping

9805,It's about pressure from economic lobbyists.
9806,"FWIW, the fact that it is dominant now is actually good, because that means the current extent of transmissibility won't get much higher."
9807,"Living in the highly vaccinated Northeast we haven't seen a rise yet, so I'm hoping we really curbed transmission enough."
9808,"I know this sub knows this, but the current variants already affects your mental state."
9809,"Not to mention all the strokes covid can cause, and that‚Äôs in the people that survive"
9810,"It's the kids I'm concerned about, I hope they find a vaccine suitable for children, but parents will refuse on the kids behalf."
9811,That's not fair
9812,&gt;There‚Äôs no reason to think this would increase protection in people who‚Äôs immunity has not waned from the first two doses (that‚Äôs pretty much everybody).
9813,"Pfizer has stated that they are seeing data showing that protection DOES wane after about 6 months, though."
9814,Wearing kevlar drastically reduces your chances of dying from a bullet hit.
9815,What's your point?
9816,"From their perspective, efficacy rates can only be compared to one another if they were performed at the same time, in the same place, and against the same variant."
9817,The mRNA vaccines were tested at around the same time against the Alpha variant.
9818,They have generally the same efficacy rate.
9819,The other vaccines were tested at a different time when different variants were taking place.
9820,"&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, all the vaccines provide a stronger immune response than a natural infection and are generally within the same order of magnitude in terms of ongoing efficacy rates."
9821,May they be wrong?
9822,Yes.
9823,But their reasoning has generally been sound up to this point.
9824,Repeating a lie five times doesn‚Äôt make it true.
9825,&gt;	See I hate this kind of argument because you have no way to prove either side.
9826,Other than the actual data regarding covid cases and deaths per capita.

9830,"Using neutralizing assays to determine immunity is questionable at best, looks at only one part of the immune response (IgG serum neutralization), does it in vitro, and makes a lot of assumptions

Amen!"
9831,It's the best we had at the time.
9832,"Reinfections are rare, and I address that later in the comment."
9833,&gt;2.
9834,"Real world data is going to be far more valuable in my opinion, luckily we have a lot of research on reinfection:

Totally, do you disagree with the links I provided in the section you quoted?"
9835,"Edit:

I think there may be an effect of immune escape mutations on vaccine efficacy."
9836,"It would be interesting to investigate this further, however I'd like to highlight how awesome the vaccines are relative to infection."
9837,"If you have a suggestion for how to reword that section, I'd love to read it!"
9838,"If the Delta variant is more contagious and better able to evade the vaccines, then we MIGHT (I said ""might"", btw) need to enact some other measures at times."
9839,That there would be some breakthrough cases even with the older variants doesn't mean that there is no scenario where the Delta or or variants can cause us to take some other measures.
9840,"Yeah, I think we have learned a lot in the last 15 months, whether we like it or not."
9841,One thing we have learned is that it now takes about 2-3 months for a reasonably-contagious virus to spread globally from an initial hotspot.
9842,The advent of ubiquitous air travel has really changed the game.
9843,"When ships were how people got around, the transit time was usually long enough for the passengers to either die or beat back the disease before reaching their destination."
9844,Now vast numbers of people can (and do) travel anywhere in the world before they even know they are sick.
9845,So the traditional barriers against global infection are mostly gone.
9846,"At the same time, we don't seem to have developed effective countermeasures for this, or a willingness to use them."
9847,People want their vacations and trips no matter what.
9848,"Another thing we have learned is that it still takes years to develop, manufacture, and distribute a vaccine to the global population."
9849,"So reliance on vaccines, while helpful and important, is not going to be a total solution for anything."

9900,"Which is just completely false, they were busy vaccinating the high risk groups, but obviously your colleagues are younger so they weren't vaccinated yet."
9901,In addition the vaccine delivery only really started to kick off in May/June.

9912,I mean that people seem to believe the virus can‚Äôt enter their system.
9913,"As far as I understand it, the virus can absolutely still enter your system."
9914,It‚Äôs not like it somehow blocks your nose or mouth from virus entry.
9915,It‚Äôs still about telling your immune system how to respond.
9916,Breakthrough cases as I understand it is when the vaccine gets more of a foothold and generally shows on tests.
9917,"But you still can be negative but have the virus in your system, even if at extremely low levels because the immune system has started fighting it."
9918,"So for example, you go to Costco unmasked but are vaccinated."
9919,"Someone who has COVID and is unvaccinated coughs basically right at you, and you inhale thousands of Covid particles/virus."
9920,"The vaccine does nothing to stop that, Covid is in your system."
9921,"By at least how I define infected, you are infected."
9922,Maybe the clinical definition is different and that‚Äôs where confusion can arise and if so I apologize.
9923,"But my point is in at least that sense, you are infected."
9924,"Then your immune system sees it and kills it, hopefully no breakthrough really at that point."
9925,Hopefully that makes my point I tried to make clearer.
9926,"If I‚Äôm wrong on that and someone with Covid literally coughing in your face would somehow not allow the virus to enter your body at all, then that would be extremely surprising to me."

10291,"Sure, but now that's 300+ people daily who will develop long COVID."
10292,It'll be a non-trivial amount who lose their sense of smell and taste.
10293,"All because people, for some inexplicable reason, still refuse to get vaccinated."
10294,Mindboggling.
10295,If they‚Äôre fully vaccinated how does that help?
10296,Holy shit just get the free fucking vaccine that‚Äôs at every Walgreens in America.
10297,"Ah ok, I've noticed a few other counties that you'd think would have higher vaccination rates."

10315,"The people are great, more or less."
10316,"It's close to 70% of adults who are fully vaccinated in many areas, which is only 55% of the population."
10317,"Yes it has an effect but it's nowhere near enough for herd immunity, especially not with Delta."
10318,"We would likely need 80+% of the entire population, not just adults (or like 95% of adults) to be vaccinated for that now."

10347,Go spread that narrative to someone selfish enough to believe it.
10348,&gt;Social distance doesnt work against a√´rosols Unless you distance plus 8 meters.
10349,Refer above.
10350,There's also a reason why social distancing is recommended along with wearing masks.
10351,&gt;There have been papers about this for years.
10352,Why don't you actually give a source with regards to COVID?
10353,"&gt;I am saying the measures dont work

Based on what exactly?"
10354,&gt;vaccines might work.
10355,We will see in fall when we are back in season again.
10356,Imagine doubting the efficacy of vaccines when literally **all** available data from numerous countries shows that they are actually effective.
10357,"&gt;For now, where I live we are seeing worse numbers than last year summer, dispite vaccine."
10358,With stricter measures.
10359,Where are you living in then?
10360,&gt;But in the mean time my consititional right have been stript.
10361,"I am bunlaw not allowed to hug my mom, Kids are on and off out of school."
10362,Why don't you source these restrictions?
10363,"&gt;It's not because of people not abiding the rules

If your country is still facing high number of cases daily, it's exactly because people didn't abide by the rules."
10364,"&gt;But enjoy your anually booster shot

I won't enjoy it, but I'll certainly prefer it to developing any long COVID."
10365,&gt;enjoy forcing Kids to act as a biological shield for your long covid protection.
10366,Lol.
10367,"&gt;But dont drag me into this cesspool

Oh, you can stay in *yours* away from the rest of us."
10368,This dude knows the answer to his own question.
10369,He wants to argue with people lmao.
10370,It depends on what level of risk you're willing to take.
10371,"It's very, very unlikely that you'll get covid, but it's still possible."
10372,"I'm personally ok with the risk, but not everyone is, and that's ok."

10375,"""as a service"" usually refers to paying an ongoing fee for a service that a company provides for you."

10383,Stop.
10384,Don't.
10385,Come back.
10386,Is that a joke?
10387,Because part of the reason one doesn't create bioweapons if you have an ounce of sense is because viruses and bacteria can evolve beyond ones control.
10388,Even if you develop vaccines and cures.
10389,That's kind of what they do.
10390,As opposed to chemical and nuclear weapons.
10391,So bioengineered viruses could absolutely evolve.
10392,And can do so quite quickly.
10393,Also technology spiraling beyond an inventors control is so commonplace that it's a clich√©.
10394,I don‚Äôt have a solution.

10399,well there will be only one way.
10400,get vaccinated to be ill with covid.
10401,everyone who does not want the vaccine will get ill with Covid at some point until this pandemic is over.
10402,"So now why would I, as a pretty healthy 19 year old, want to take this vaccine with still many unknowns to be discovered, when my odds of dying from covid or having any serious sickness from it are practically the same as dying from choking on food?"
10403,An alternative perspective to offer.
10404,"The scope of conversation is so tunnelled on vax vs no vax, there are not many discussions around the other things that people who are hesitant to get jabbed might be doing to reduce the chance of infection."
10405,For example there is interesting research into dandelion extract and certain CBD extracts modulating the ACE2 receptor; the gateway through which COVID infects us.
10406,"Of course, no large scale pharma-conglomerates are interested in funding and fast-tracking these studies, unfortunately."
10407,So the vaccine becomes the only topic of conversation.
10408,Sadly these days I see to many echo chambers / polarized people either agreeing with one another or throwing insults at the other group.
10409,So people tend to stick to in circles with people who share a similar outlook.
10410,I‚Äôm finding that a common reason for vaccine hesitancy is peoples personal experiences being let down by the medical system and/or political interference.
10411,A good example is the suppression of cannabis as a medicine for decades - by the very same businesses and groups rolling out the vaccines.
10412,The manufacturers also have  a less than stellar track record when it comes to putting profits over health outcomes.
10413,"So there‚Äôs often more to the picture than ridiculous and unfounded conspiracies, although they are certainly out there and taken as gospel by a worryingly large number of people who are not interesting in learning to evaluate sources properly."
10414,When you‚Äôve lost multiple loved ones directly because of this suppression of knowledge and/or from prescribed medications that went wrong - it becomes easier to empathize and understand the levels of mistrust that are present.
10415,Anti-vaxxer‚Äôs care more about that .000001% than they do about the millions affected by Covid.

10419,Why does every news title have to be negative.
10420,We are making tremendous progress and Florida has done a great job overall at protecting elderly.
10421,I thought it was common knowledge to not fuck around on an airplane
10422,"Yeah, it corresponds *very* well: https://imgur.com/a/xHkJ1ei

Restrictions were listed on the 26th of June, cases started climbing beginning of July and now we're here...10K+ cases per day and counting."
10423,"I get that, but every hospital bed or emergency call that has to go to an unvaccinated person instead of say someone who had an accident, or a heart attack is what I stress out over."
10424,"Sure, LA County probably has plenty of emergency services to take care of everyone, but, there are small cities near me that have one hospital, or not even that."
10425,The vaccinated folks in those cities are really the ones who I feel bad about.
10426,Makes me wonder what's going to happen after September 13 if the TSA's mask mandate is allowed to lapse.
10427,"I myself will probably never fly without a mask again, but what's going to happen with everyone else?"
10428,"Will the airlines continue to keep their mandates independently, or will they abandon them as they become too much of a headache to enforce, especially without a federal mandate backing them up?"
10429,Seriously why do so few health authorities even want to acknowledge this?
10430,Why do so many discussions completely ignore this?
10431,I have a doctor friend who think it's not real besides hospitalized patients who may never recover - is that why?
10432,"I do agree that a number of studies on this seem like BS but not all, same as how some symptoms could just be brought on by isolation and lockdowns and would happen in a control group too ... but not all."
10433,"Also some ""long covid"" is just taking a bit more than 12 weeks to recover, which isn't the biggest deal if you're feeling better every week."
10434,"With all the above caveats, studies generally say 10-30% of people infected with covid (even mild or initially asymptomatic) can get it."
10435,"When people say you're less likely to get long covid with a mild infection, that's because MOST hospitalized people will get long covid, not because it's rare among people with mild infections."
10436,"Also, the only study I could find **estimates the vaccine's protection at only 30% against long covid once you are infected**: [https://institute.global/policy/hidden-pandemic-long-covid,https://institute.global/policy/hidden-pandemic-long-covid](https://institute.global/policy/hidden-pandemic-long-covid,https://institute.global/policy/hidden-pandemic-long-covid), but I don't know how credible this study is."
10437,It got almost no media attention.
10438,"I really hope that's not it and my own thoughts are that this seems way too low, simply because the vaccines are very good protection against hospitalization, so the effect should be bigger because of that alone."

10466,"As far as I know that is what the manufacturers‚Äô and scientific claims out there are, the rest of the claims are (cringe) ‚Äúfake news‚Äù horseshit."
10467,So this means e.g.
10468,"I can still get super sick and COVID can totally fuck up my vacation, but I won‚Äôt die."
10469,And not dying is pretty fucking important part of our primary instinct which is survival.

10481,"Per the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/vaers/index.html), the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is used to collect reports of adverse events after vaccination from the general public."
10482,This is primarily used to identify potential topics to further investigate with regards to vaccine reactions.
10483,"However, because the event data in VAERS is often not verified and is often self-reported, it should not be assumed that the adverse events in VAERS are actually associated with or cause by the vaccines, nor is it possible to estimate the frequency of these adverse events from these data."

10562,"However, because the event data in VAERS is often not verified and is often self-reported, it should not be assumed that the adverse events in VAERS are actually associated with or cause by the vaccines, nor is it possible to estimate the frequency of these adverse events from these data."

10655,"Just like in the UK, the death rate, which is what really matters, has dropped to one tenth of what it used to be."
10656,"From a purely political point of view, that policy might make a lot of sense."
10657,"I'm sure the government will have statisticians who have worked out how many healthy kids will die from a mass vaccination programme compared to how many would die from a mass virus outbreak, and psychologists to advise them on how the public will react to vaccine-induced deaths compared to virus-induced ones."

11009,There are a LOT of vaccinated folks now and the vaccine isn't 100% - therefore you'll have more vaccinated folks getting infected.
11010,It's expected.

11215,Infection rates in third world countries have been *vastly* underreported for three reasons.
11216,1 - the country cannot test as many people.
11217,2 - the people cannot access a test due to their living situation.
11218,3 - the people likely are healthier and younger so don't have as bad of an infection.
11219,"The people in that area, though not documented as well, still go through the viral replication process that provides a possibility for an error in the RNA replication which can trigger the next big mutation."

11474,Are we sure the a COVID vaccine for children will have less than a 0.000002% chance of serious illness?

11478,"Until then, for kids, masks and social distancing are being mandated with the assumption that EUA will be authorized and just wait a bit more.."
11479,"But as stated above, its not a foregone conclusion."
11480,"If we don't get an EUA, are we just going to have our kids live like this indefinitely and keep waiting?"
11481,Or are we going to reach a place where children are simply deemed safe enough from COVID and allow them to have normal lives again?

11506,People can tell if they have it.
11507,You notice when your heart doesn‚Äôt work right.
11508,I never had palpitations and suddenly got palpitations and my resting heart rate on my Apple Watch literally spiked the day I got the dose.

11532,"Depending on what the issue is, getting both vaccines might not properly set you to have protection if you are immuno compromised."
11533,"Some have reported getting both vaccines, but because they are immuno, when they checked if there was any activation, it was little or nothing."
11534,Doctor told the person to walk around as if he/she didn't get the vaccine even though the person got both.
11535,That means mask up and avoid crowded places.
11536,Where did I say they cannot?
11537,"I doubt explaining this to you will help since It's July 2021 and you've likely read this a billion times by now and just don't care, but REDUCTION is not the same as ZERO."

12011,"Very commonly, this is what happens."
12012,It is not even remotely universal.
12013,"It is not some 'rule' that when a virus becomes more contagious, it also becomes less deadly."
12014,This is a reddit factoid which has been spread everywhere.
12015,It is not supported by epidemiology.
12016,The only reason viruses tend to mutate to become less deadly is because of selective pressure.
12017,"More deadly normally means it kills the host before it has a chance to spread, or it is so deadly that people alter their behaviors."
12018,"Viruses don't just become less deadly as a rule, there is a mechanism behind it."
12019,"Covid has a fairly long presymptomatic period where you can be contagious, this means the selective pressure against a deadlier variant is basically removed."
12020,"Covid could in theory mutate to be far more deadly, and as long as you can still spread it without symptoms, it would continue to spread."
12021,This is just basic evolution and natural selection.

12046,I hope mRNA changes this.
12047,"If they can get similar approval as flu vaccines, they could have a much shorter lead time to the flu season, and could even tailor the vaccine to different regions with different prevalent strains."
12048,"Yes, I acknowledged that but the flu does not always get an optimal playground and flu rates took a major hit with masking and distancing due to lower infectious rate compared to SarsCoV2."
12049,"They are both RNA viruses but flu mutation rate is based on a smaller genetic code and as you said, much longer experience for vaccine design."
12050,SarsCoV2 has a larger genome and our vaccine is predicated on the spike protein.
12051,"If a variant mutates to caus a conformational change there, then the likelihood of a strain significantly resistant to vaccine mediated immune response goes up."

12066,"The virus believed to have caused it remains with us to this day, presenting as the common cold."
12067,Overall its believed that all of the cold causing coronaviruses were responsible for major pandemics when they first emerged so it wouldn't be unusual at all for Covid-19 to wind up following the same pattern.
12068,"In that case, your grandkids and great grandkids would still likely be coming down with COVID-19 infections, decades after this pandemic has subsided."

12118,&gt; four fully vaccinated people there tested positive for the virus.

12121,"If the answer to the later part of that question is no, welcome to the future, where Covid will always circulate and some small # of people will die from it but the vast majority (and the vast, vast majority of fully vaccinated people) will just live with it and not worry about masks, distancing, etc."
12122,I think the biggest problem is that the group of experts giving advice to the government consists of medical experts only.

12154,Reddit moment
12155,"&gt;&gt;crop rotation wasn't known in Europe so much as it was known that certain fields needed to be left fallow for a year or so while weed crops we're grown
&gt;
&gt;Two- and three-fields systems are literally modes of a crop rotation."
12156,"And not like Indians had any better knowledge of soil chemistry, so no reason to blame Europeans for ""just knowing to leave it alone""."
12157,"&gt;
The two and three fields system describes exactly the fallow field rotation I mentioned."
12158,I don't understand what you are trying to prove here.
12159,"&gt;&gt;They also had the ""three sisters"" method of planting where corn, beans and squash were grown side by side as permaculture, which kept the soil productive while still providing a complete diet."
12160,"&gt;For one, this method also doesn't work with any kind of mechanization (plowing with domesticated animals included), so it's a dead-end for a large-scale agriculture."
12161,"Plow field, plant bean corn bean squash, bean corn bean squash."
12162,"It works just fine with mechanized planting, just not mechanized harvesting."
12163,"&gt;&gt;They used animals that North America didn't have, and fertilized with their feces."
12164,&gt;So?
12165,They domesticated and used them.
12166,"America had llamas used for moving burdens for quite some time 

Small parts of the Andes had llamas."
12167,They were not widespread.
12168,"They're not particularly great as food animals, and as beasts of burden, dogs are significantly more compliant."
12169,&gt;(since you insist on mentioning potato that has little to do with NA).
12170,Potatoes were grown all around North America.
12171,&gt;&gt;They didn't need it.
12172,"&gt;
&gt;So?"
12173,"They didn't, and the overall development of agriculture went the other way."
12174,"Looks like having low population density


Before the introduction of smallpox, several native American cities, ones the size of some European cities, thrived."
12175,"Low pop density, on the order you're bringing up here, wasn't a feature of American life until Europeans (in this case unwittingly) fucked it up."
12176,&gt; and high yield cultures helps to not need stuff.
12177,"Wait, wait, wait."
12178,Do you realize you just validated my entire argument?
12179,Native Americans had better crop yields is basically my entire agriculture argument right there.
12180,&gt;&gt;North Americans were using cover crops before Europeans showed up.
12181,"We don't know for sure how long before, but it was before."
12182,"&gt;
&gt;Would be really nice to get a good source on it."
12183,"For one, growing beans as cover crops after growing beans as a part of ""three sisters"" looks strange."
12184,I'm having a hard time finding a primary or scholarly source on this one.
12185,"In certain climates, some varieties of beans grow in the fall and winter while corn does not, and when growing potatoes the soil is left depleted at the end of a season, so there are two good reasons to rotate beans into a native American garden."
12186,&gt;So?
12187,Wild apples are small and sour.
12188,"Some, yeah."
12189,But Europeans weren't cross breeding apples for the most part.
12190,They were just eating the little sour ones because they're still food.
12191,&gt;Wild olives are nowhere near the one you get in a shop nowadays.
12192,"They're smaller, yeah."
12193,The differences between the wild (and the domesticated) olives and what you get in the store is a matter of processing the olive with chemicals.
12194,"&gt;Wild wheat looses grains easily, and domestication included making it sturdier, so you do not end up with half of the harvest left in the field (people literally had to fight the way it plants itself)."
12195,"That's really the only difference, though, and the easiest trait to accidentally breed out."
12196,&gt;&gt;Potatoes were straight up poison before native Americans fixed them.
12197,"&gt;If I remember correctly, tubers of the wild potato are relatively edible and were even consumed raw (and for sure - when properly cooked), so it wasn't ""a deadly plant turned into a miraculous food""."
12198,A good reason why the tuber is the only part we consume nowadays.
12199,"https://www.alcademics.com/2014/09/the-potato-explained.html

You do not remember correctly."
12200,"Wild potatoes are extremely bitter, small, and must be processed with clay in order to eat them."
12201,&gt;I don't think people ever domesticated something really poisonous just to eat it.
12202,"https://www.hobbyfarms.com/beware-poisonous-wild-cousins-tomatoes-carrots/

Let's go ahead and add tomatoes to the list of plants about which you're wrong then."
12203,"&gt; Either it was already at least partially edible, or it was domesticated for other needs and then found to be good to eat it."
12204,"After all, the green part of potato (the most poisonous one in the wild) is still not used much."
12205,"&gt;And I hope you understand all of those listed are domesticated species (just less optimized), and bulgur is not even a grain - it's a dish made of wheat."
12206,Okay.
12207,&gt;&gt;Houses and boats were not particularly important to them.
12208,"When they were, they did amazing things, but for the most part they didn't build permanent structures and they didn't need boats to go beyond a couple miles from shore."
12209,"&gt;
&gt;Amazing for prehistoric people - maybe."
12210,But even by means of Ancient Egypt and Babilonia it's not really impressive.
12211,Again pretty normal for Neolithic people.
12212,Look at Pueblo dwellings.
12213,&gt;It also says a lot about the level of your trade and travel when you do not use boats much while having access to huge waterways.
12214,"Trade was conducted along waterways, bro."
12215,I'm not sure what your point is.
12216,&gt;&gt;Did any European in north America know any of that shit?
12217,Did any doctor in most major cities?
12218,"They were bounced between academics and philosophers, but were incredibly obscure."
12219,"&gt;
&gt;Luzzi's book was used for training doctors."
12220,"So yes, chances were good."
12221,"As for a germ theory, between ""someone knows and supports it"" and ""have no idea"" Europe is a clean winner."
12222,"Very, very few."
12223,You have admitted so much yourself.
12224,&gt;Now this one is just some gibberish.
12225,Monks openly practicing herbalism for centuries were burned as witches?
12226,"https://www.jstor.org/stable/43297753

Monks, no, but the few monks that did practice some herbalism weren't accessible by most of society."
12227,&gt; Folk medicine was punished so much it survived until modern times?
12228,Europe had medical universities for hundreds of years by the time of Columbus!
12229,That's where the barbers were trained to drain people's blood to balance their humors.
12230,&gt; By 17th century botany was an integral part of medical knowledge!
12231,Well after contact with native Americans and well before humor theory fell from favor.
12232,"&gt;And this knowledge was constantly expanding based on what European contacts worldwide brought up - for one, a treatment for malaria (an Old World disease) was found in Peru in said 17th century by a trained European apothecary."
12233,"*The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp* is a 17th century picture (which, by the way, is done on a technical level impossible for any culture of NA at that time."

12279,We thought my SO had a seizure a couple weeks ago and he begged me not to take him to the hospital because he was afraid of the expense.
12280,"We haven't gotten the bill yet but he had some scans done so it'll probably cost several thousand, we will have to be on a payment plan."
12281,"We are 29 and 31, just for reference."

12300,"Also if the creator of mRNA vaccines didn't get silenced over his concerns for the vaccine I would agree this is all good, but as humans we actually cannot even weigh the information, it's just all or nothing."

12308,It's still under investigation atm!
12309,That‚Äôs not accurate.
12310,The Israeli small study has come under a lot of scrutiny.
12311,Well there's two ways of reaching herd immunity I guess.

12315,Who ever would have thought free online social media platforms would be the easiest and cheapest way for other countries to affect our democracy.
12316,I know.
12317,My point was about the large increase in infections.
12318,Most people in the us are not fully vaccinated.
12319,The percentage is 48 percent.
12320,55 percent of the us is partially vaccinated.
12321,You are looking at 18+ statistics.
12322,"Yeah, it‚Äôs also important to remember that only a small percentage have myocarditis after vaccination."
12323,"Since it can sometimes be asymptomatic, caution is probably a good choice."
12324,"Even without myocarditis, it‚Äôs probably best to hold off on heavy exercise as your body is trying to make a strong immune response."
12325,"The microscopic muscle tears from lifting, means the body has to work harder to repair those at the same time it is trying to make antibody and memory cells."
12326,Except northern communities in places like Saskatchewan.

12335,"Sometimes heavy metals (like lead), in widely used items like makeup."
12336,"I'm not saying they're useless, but I am saying FDA approval doesn't mean much sometimes."
12337,I personally wouldn't hinge my choice of getting a life-saving vaccine on waiting for them to approve it.
12338,"Yeah it is not that simple, sorry."
12339,"Not that you are certainly wrong, just the ultimate potential for mutation is not unlimited necessarily."
12340,"Flu does not mutate into something drastically different, we have an updated vaccine which is fairly effective yearly, and it's been around for a long, long time."
12341,Much longer than Covid.
12342,I think pointing out the flu situation should be enough but maybe I'm overestimating your comprehension.
12343,"I fear EUA may not ever be authorized TBH, see my post above."
12344,Death isn't the only health outcome of covid tho.
12345,"Also, checks death toll, well shit, it is a big one tho."
12346,"Also, mutations."
12347,The way countries with low vaccination rates keep their deaths down is health and safety countermeasures.
12348,This could work in Florida.
12349,Plus everyone that will suffer from the long haul symptoms which are no joke either.
12350,"See my posts above about my worries for an EUA approval, too."

Ah yes!"
12358,Comparing oranges to apples.
12359,Dying is way worst than getting a Myocarditis/Pericarditis.
12360,"Should be sorts by ""able to think for themselves and did research on all of these companies before jumping into the fire blindly""

12361,"I said to my husband last night ( while listening to anti vaxxers we accidentally stumbled upon), I cannot believe the ill will in my head I‚Äôve wished on some people during this whole thing and I kinda don‚Äôt feel bad."
12362,That thing with wanting the ECDC to change their color coding based on hospitalizations is so ridiculous lol.
12363,It's not like the patients in hospitals are coming across the borders to infect everyone.
12364,Of course our hospitalizations are very low but having 10.000 cases a day still poses a huge risk to countries with lower vaccination rates
12365,Get vaccinated in the next 2 weeks or we inject it in your sack!
12366,No you‚Äôre wrong.
12367,"It‚Äôs not black and white, it‚Äôs a game of percentages."
12368,"You are much, much less likely to catch and then spread covid with a vaccine than without one."
12369,It‚Äôs about reducing risk.
12370,How are we this far into a pandemic and people don‚Äôt understand this shit?
12371,I didn‚Äôt think of that but you‚Äôre right
12372,"Fauci has said that 99% of hospitalizations are unvaccinated, so actually it's more like 1 in 100."
12373,"I am on a prescription medication that costs around $18,000/month."
12374,"No one actually pays that, but my insurance absolutely does."
12375,People do pay several thousand.
12376,Most people just go without if they can't get it covered.
12377,There are several charitable organizations that help with the cost.
12378,I paid over $400 for a medication last weekend.
12379,"Even with good insurance, which costs several hundred a month, a prescription for about $10 is super low."
12380,My baby has been on a few meds recently because he's been sick and I think we pay about $100/month.
12381,I'll keep the mask until we get long hauler numbers for it.

12387,"Lol
 As if 0.3% dying will make any difference."
12388,You need a Thanos snap to make any visible difference
12389,What a shitshow.
12390,"Until your vaccine runs out and you get it full tilt 

Pfizer already said they think boosters are needed and our government disagreed probably not to cause mass panic and tank the economy."
12391,We will never get through this.
12392,It's the new cold but 100 times worse.
12393,"No, we do not know the extent of the mutations."
12394,There are limits which are unknown.
12395,Will it mutate into a super virus that kills everyone?
12396,Or will it just keep mutating with small changes that don't make that huge of a difference.
12397,Some viruses have limits on how drastically they can mutate from the original.
12398,It is not that black and white.
12399,People need to cool it with the downvotes humble themselves.
12400,You don't know everything.
12401,We certainly don't know everything about this yet.
12402,You're not a responsible member of society.
12403,That is what you are not.
12404,Bad bot.
12405,"But you still spread it regardless of vaccination, hence the ever increasing cases going in hand with ever increasing vaccinations."
12406,"Cases were never the issue, it was protecting the NHS with hospitalisations which are not rising anywhere close to the prior rate because the vaccinations work."
12407,"Which means, you shouldn't need a passport as you would still spread Covid regardless of you having 2 doses, 1 dose or no doses"
12408,We've got multiple variants on multiple continents in a year.
12409,The rate of mutation leading to actual conformational changes is relatively high.
12410,The way mutation works is that as the body starts developing an immune response the the replication of the virus intracellularly evolves as a wide spread of nonspecific and specific antibodies arise.
12411,Repeat this several thousand times in a low vaccination rate population with propensity to have more symptomatic patients (FL is God's waiting room for the US) and likelihood of external population intrusion (big travel area that is super popular for antivaxxers this year due to Governor response to masking and distancing) and you have an optimal evolutionary mutation ground for an rapidly spreading virus.

12637,I don't know how to trust the vaccine only 95%.
12638,It's either 0 or 100.
12639,"Our vaccination numbers are high and our covid numbers are low where I am, so It's a risk I'll take similar to the risk of getting in a car."
12640,&gt;The lady has a history of bizarre behavior.
12641,It‚Äôs not attacking her reputation it‚Äôs a fact she is untrustworthy.
12642,Yeah.
12643,Sure.
12644,Doubledown on the reputation attacks.
12645,It works particularly well with authorities that look the other way.
12646,&gt;Btw as a Florida resident I actually believe Florida has done a better job in the pandemic then many other large states.
12647,"If you define better as a bit less inconvenience, for a whole lot of preventable deaths, sure."
12648,Prop's to the Florida authorities for running highly efficient funeral services and hospital transfers.
12649,"I mean, medical services barely felt the weight of coronavirus in the Florida system."

12660,Why do redditors keep spouting this BS.
12661,"""Mutated variants are never more fatal"" is demonstrably false, just look at the second wave of Spanish Flu."
12662,I had to delete Twitter today because I could not deal with both extremes.
12663,There are a lot of people afraid out there still.
12664,I wonder if it's an introvert vs extraverted thing.
12665,"As an extraverted I can not go though what I went through in the last year again, and I hate working from home."
12666,"I absolutely understand where you are coming from, but mask mandates are more likly."
12667,There will not be lock downs or capacity requirements again.
12668,It definitely does.
12669,Any viral infection can.
12670,My lungs were shot for a while after Swine Flu
12671,Pfizer and Moderna are preparing boosters.

12675,"I repeatedly told parents that I had been vaccinated along with my whole family, none of us had any severe side effects."

12677,"I‚Äôve had these students for a couple of years so I know the parents well, some confided that they were afraid to take it but would still do it since other family members had gotten it, they just couldn‚Äôt get to the vaccination sites because there were none nearby."
12678,"Some told me they showed up and WERE TURNED AWAY because their ID was expired and they couldn‚Äôt renew it because the DMV and/or the Mexican Consulate (where many of them are able to get their Mexican IDs, which are accepted as ID in many places here in L.A.) were/are backlogged."
12679,I couldn‚Äôt believe it when they told me they had been turned away.
12680,"I begged these parents to go back and ask to speak with a supervisor to see if an exception could be made, of course they wouldn‚Äôt go, they‚Äôre scared to‚Äîeven when they are in the country legally."
12681,"For some people it‚Äôs never been easy to just show up at a site and get their vaccine, even though they‚Äôre widely accessible."
12682,Can you elaborate?
12683,Is immune different than vaccinated ?
12684,How is this different than other viruses and their vaccines?
12685,PHE actually say the Delta variant is more likely(roughly 2x) to cause hospitalisation than Alpha.
12686,Your question was still valid and thankfully you‚Äôre open to admitting new facts.
12687,I was as horrified as you were probably when I first saw the numbers from Israelis.
12688,But other reports were more consistent.
12689,New variants might change that but then we hopefully get a booster as well.
12690,Your anxiety doesn‚Äôt sound totally unfounded since you have anecdotal experiences.
12691,"That said, I‚Äôll be pretty shocked if things reversed course."
12692,I live in one of the most liberal cities in the country that just recently reopened.
12693,There‚Äôs no appetite for things to go back except from a small minority.
12694,Lots of the country struggled to maintain restrictions even when things were bad.
12695,At this point now that vaccines are out there‚Äôs no reason for things to roll back.
12696,Beyond approving vaccines for kids there‚Äôs not much left to do at this point.
12697,"COVID ain‚Äôt going away, the vaccine protects damn well against severe disease, the vaccinated can move on and the unvaccinated need to keep protecting themselves via masks/distancing if they care to."

12710,"One of my uncle's didn't get an ambulance for eight hours, the unbearable heat was decomposing his body while his children and grandchildren were in the other room."
12711,"Finally, they got a rickshaw to put the body on the roof of it to take it straight to the crematorium."

12717,"If that is the case, they might have a reason and maybe are the possible consequences of the shot."
12718,"But they must extreme their care in order to not to get infected in said games, and after that, get the shot as soon as they can."
12719,"I worked as a contact tracer last summer and fall and I'm too familiar with human nature on this subject to think we'll get to that ""everyone is safe"" point."
12720,Also hospitalizations and deaths will always tend to be somewhat delayed from initial case onset.
12721,So we'll see the real effects of these 10k cases in a week or two.

12773,"BUT good news for you, J&amp;J announced new data recently that shows it's actually more efficacious against the Delta than it is against, for example, the South Africa variant."
12774,Do a Google and you'll find some articles on it.
12775,"If you have J&amp;J, you have excellent protection against the Delta variant!"
12776,People wanna be around people.

12779,"But I'll just say that for people who didn't have an SO during this time, or who lived alone, or had stress in their relationship/breakups, it has to be incredibly refreshing to be able to be around other people like that."
12780,Vaccine is both body armor and a fence.
12781,The fence is likely to keep it out in the first case if you get the full vaccination.
12782,But all of them offer 93% protection against hospitalization and death.

12799,"Sure there are people that take personal responsibility, however a lot of people simply don't care about covid."
12800,Should they care?
12801,Probably but it is extremely naive from the government to expect people to care enough because most people don't and just like to party.

12924,It's worth noting that the Walvax-Abogen vaccine is closer to the CureVac vaccine than the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines though in that it isn't nucleoside-modified and uses a smaller dose.
12925,I'm assuming you're from the US?
12926,Spain has overtaken the US in terms of first doses as a percentage of the population and is only 2% behind fully vaccinated folks with almost no slowdown .
12927,"The strategy here was to come down the age brackets strictly and vaccine uptake has been really high, for the 80 plus age group there was 99% uptake and for 70-79 there was 97.2% uptake."
12928,Uptake is on trend for each age group to be in the high 90s.
12929,"Data taken from here -&gt; https://www.mscbs.gob.es/profesionales/saludPublica/ccayes/alertasActual/nCov/documentos/Informe_GIV_comunicacion_20210709.pdf  (It's in Spanish, sorry!"

12931,I dare to say that the world is heavily inspired by American culture/celebrities/influencers so when they see an American going back to normality (e.g.
12932,fully unmasked concert crowds) they unconsciously believe they can go back to normality as well (except they don't have vaccines)
12933,Reddit peeps hate when you make sense and question their way of thinking.

12937,Part of that is impatience with people who are stupid and not taking it seriously.
12938,"Like, ok, I‚Äôve done my part, and I‚Äôm not willing to wait for you."
12939,It's actually pretty simple.
12940,There is nothing the mRNA does that the covid virus doesn't already do.
12941,When you get covid (or any virus) it hijacks your cells to process the viral RNA or viral DNA instead of your own.
12942,"But unlike a vaccine which is a controlled dose, a virus is totally uncontrolled as it replicates through your body."
12943,When evaluating the safety profile of the vaccine (for long term effects as you said) the baseline you need to compare it to is covid.
12944,And we already know covid has significantly more long term side effects.
12945,Superspreader events and delta.
12946,Well its obvious you don't think its flawed.
12947,But its as flawed as your ability for introspection and critical thought.
12948,"And I note, with interest, you've offered no argument against my assertion."
12949,Just a mere denial.
12950,"You sir, are a genius!"
12951,"I work in the hotel industry and it‚Äôs been shocking how quickly things turned around since early May, especially on the weekends."
12952,One of my hotels would typically run rates in the $89-$109 range and since May we‚Äôve been running weekend rates in the $159+ range due to the demand.
12953,Now we‚Äôre left wondering how long this will hold before it reverts back to more prepandemic levels.
12954,It's better to look at the 7 day average and avoid outliers.
12955,"June 20th cases may be low but June 19 was 7,572 and June 21 was 15,839."
12956,So picking out June 20 specifically gives a misleading view.
12957,"The 7 day average on June 20 was 11,134 compared to it currently being at 18,272."
12958,"From that we are indeed on the rise but not quite as dramatic as 4,000 -&gt; 35,000"

12964,"...and according to the CDC: ""Vaccinated people 'safe' from delta variant""

I am pretty irritated that the CDC director continues to go on TV and spread this fake message that people won't get sick and have no chance of severe illness after getting vaccinated."
12965,"I understand that they want more people vaccinated and don't want to give them reasons not to, but I know too many vaccinated people that think they are 100% fine after hearing about how ""safe"" they are in the news."
12966,Because it's quite clear to him and others who are familiar with this part of our country that if government workers are sent to homes people are going to feel attacked and someone's going to get shot.
12967,And it will set back their efforts to convince people to do it voluntarily.
12968,"If they feel attacked, they are going to double down."
12969,&gt;This is better than expected news.
12970,"""according to two infectious disease experts at the University of Alabama at Birmingham""

Why would I trust anything from the state with the lowest vaccination rate and highest poverty rate in the entire of the US ?"
12971,"Pretty scared rn, I have a doctor‚Äôs appointment that‚Äôs very important and I don‚Äôt think I should skip it, on this Tuesday, but in my country (one of the first world countries with infection rates similar to USA, Germany, France etc - low but still there) I have not been able to get a vaccine."
12972,I am very worried.
12973,I know that if I wear an N95 and I‚Äôm not there very long the chances of infection are low but... I‚Äôm still worried.
12974,Facts don‚Äôt matter to these people.

12985,I'll be like that when my kid can get it.
12986,"Until then, people's selfishness is putting my family at risk."
12987,No one cares what Elon Musk has to say.
12988,"While I agree with your statement for the most part, the thing I'm worried about is thar there really isn't any pressure on this virus to mutate to become milder."
12989,That almost always happens though simply because if more people are walking around spreading it because they feel fine then the virus can spread further.
12990,With a virus that spreads asymptomatically in large portion of people and pre-symptomatically in the rest of them then there is no selective pressure for the virus to mutate to become milder because it is already spreading efficiently.
12991,The only pressure is to continue to mutate to become more efficient at infecting its host and infecting people that have previously been infected.
12992,The severity of the resulting mutations are a coin flip.
12993,I think that's why we are seeing strains that are actually more severe at the moment.
12994,Just my thoughts anyway.
12995,"I think people are somehow less afraid of a virus created by humans, because that implies we have some control."
12996,"Accepting that this virus came from wild animals and then has been progressively ‚Äúimproving‚Äù it‚Äôs genome as it spread around the world largely unchecked,  is terrifying because it could happen again at any time and probably will."
12997,[deleted]
12998,Let's be clear.
12999,"Your numbers, even though you admit are made up, are extremely inaccurate."
13000,Unvaccinated people under the age of 50 have &lt;1% chance of hospitalization.
13001,Vaccinated people should see that percentage further reduced by 85% (so &lt;0.1%).
13002,Nothing is ever sure with science.
13003,That‚Äôs the point.
13004,Yeah I guess there‚Äôs some contradictory information out there about waning immunity.
13005,Seems premature to assume the drop in effectiveness in Israel was due to declining effectiveness.
13006,"I‚Äôm pretty sure Israel‚Äôs figures include asymptomatic cases, which the original efficacy numbers didn‚Äôt."
13007,"Either way, we‚Äôre talking about a third dose of the same shot, not a tweaked one for delta (yet)."
13008,Florida is mid pack in the country in vaccinations per capita and also mid pack in deaths per capita.
13009,Quit making stuff up.
13010,"When the facts don‚Äôt fit your narrative, you people just create ‚Äúfacts‚Äù out of thin air and it‚Äôs gotten old."

13019,Fucking assholes.
13020,Why not?
13021,"Japan only tests about 50,000 people a day, nationally."
13022,"Tokyo only tests about 8,000 people a day on average."

13048,Congratulations.
13049,You've found a large child to adopt.
13050,AND they're stilling lying about the total numbers by now pulling out and not reporting 'non-resident infections'.
13051,"Regardless of the validity of that, it's being done so that their cases a month ago are higher than their cases are now, because by eliminating non-resident cases they can manufacture a decline."
13052,"You can see all the data here:

Covid:

Excess:   https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsregisteredweeklyinenglandandwalesprovisional/weekending25june2021

I think the point he's making is that the measures taken to deal with Covid also reduced deaths from other things."
13053,"For example, with masks and social distancing other respiratory illnesses were reduced."
13054,"So while there were a lot of deaths from Covid, there were fewer from other things than normal, and so the excess is actually below the Covid total."
13055,"This isn't the case everywhere, but it seems to be in the UK."
13056,The CDC is just covering for themselves again after another policy screwup.

13108,There has been very little proven spread in American schools in general masks or not.
13109,&gt; Source?
13110,That sounds made up.
13111,"&gt; 
&gt; 

It's only vaguely true in reference to viruses with an extremely high mortality rate that kill quickly."
13112,"It sounds like someone picked up a bit of knowledge, but didn't realize it was only true in one set of circumstances."
13113,A virus has no will of its own.
13114,It just reproduces and makes mistakes in doing that.
13115,Some of those mistakes make it deadlier.
13116,Some of those mistakes make it spread faster or slower.
13117,Some of those mistakes make the onset of disease come on sooner or faster.
13118,"From an evolutionary standpoint, the variants that survive will simply be the ones that are capable of continued reproduction."
13119,The ones that become dominant will be the ones that are better at reproducing and staying in the population.
13120,What this individual is referring to is the paradox that a virus needs its host to live long enough to survive to pass it on or else it's an evolutionary dead end.
13121,A virus such as Ebola is so deadly and progresses so quickly in killing its host that it can't spread effectively.
13122,Ebola burns through areas because it kills too quickly.
13123,"So yes, if Ebola were to actually break out onto the world scene, it would probably be because it evolved to be less deadly."
13124,That would make it more effective at reproducing and spreading.
13125,But that's not true of most viruses.
13126,Most viruses aren't so deadly that they kill their hosts before spreading.
13127,"There's a wide middle range for a virus where they can be quite deadly, as coronavirus is, without damaging their own ability to reproduce."
13128,There's also a ton of other factors that affect the spread of a virus.
13129,"Before the invention of successful treatment, HIV had a near 100% mortality rate."
13130,"However, it stayed dormant for years before symptoms started to appear."
13131,"It had plenty of time to spread to other hosts, and it didn't mutate to become less deadly."
13132,It didn't need to.
13133,A version of Ebola that had a 30-day window before the onset of disease symptoms could spread much farther without being one whit less deadly.
13134,Another factor is how the virus is transmitted.
13135,"Ebola, thankfully, is transmitted only through bodily fluids."
13136,This vastly limits transmission.
13137,An airborne variant of Ebola would spread much faster.
13138,"However, it could still probably be contained very easily due to how easy symptoms are to spot."
13139,Covid is airborne and asymptomatic in large portions of the population.
13140,"There's no evolutionary pressure for it to become less deadly, and it could probably become a great deal more deadly without remotely hindering its own ability to reproduce."
13141,So the person you're responding to is simply wrong.
13142,"Considering we‚Äôre already seeing that, such as venues are filled, flights are oversold, hotels are filled, it‚Äôs almost guaranteed if trend is holding then we will be back to pre-pandemic."
13143,"Cool, but Florida is one of the fastest growing states in the country, so you‚Äôre the oddball there."
13144,The rules and probably the Euro Championship?
13145,"I think we need Voters Unions, to pool our votes together on issues we agree about and be able to use them to force politicians to do what's in our interests over their moneyed backers."
13146,A whole load of Max Verstappen fans were in Austria at the Grand Prix I wonder if that's got something to do with it?
13147,Chilean study was against Gamma &amp; Lambda strains actually because their vaccination campaign (and study) started in February and that's when those strains started rising there.
13148,That's why there is difference between Turkey &amp; Chile studies.
13149,The Rutte Doctrine.
13150,Spoken like a true anarchist.

13152,Why don't they have a billion vectored vaccines yet?
13153,"with the vaccine, 6 people out of 100 are hospitalized lets say."
13154,"(Number are just for assumption)

without vaccines, 80 people out of 100 are hospitalized."
13155,and the health care system collapses.
13156,More mutations come.
13157,The math is quite simple and I think that's what news and media should emphasize.
13158,"""Texas man vaccinated, contracts Delta variant, hospitalized"" this title so raw and manipulative considering existing vaccine hesitancy."
13159,This is very key.
13160,Some seem to ignore how important age is to the data.
13161,Why are young people walking around like it doesn‚Äôt matter.. because it doesn‚Äôt.
13162,After a year of being careful ‚Ä¶ and now old people can be vaccinated‚Ä¶ anyone left in the older population and unvaccinated is a victim of their own poor education and choices.

13285,That is why I feel positive about the future.
13286,"The vaccines are working, as time goes on, boosters can be added for those who are most vulnerable, the biggest issue right now is getting more people vaccinated to further limit the viruses ability to spread unchecked."

13302,All states except Montana are at will.
13303,Right to work means employees can't be forced to join a union at a workplace (which dramatically weakens the power of unions).

13306,Unvaccinated people are actually safer than vaccinated ones if they get a negative test before attending events or traveling.
13307,"Vaccinated can be asyntomatic, they don't take any test and spread the virus to a lot of people (like happened in Israel)"

13440,2) reduced community spread of the virus.
13441,"the more people around you that are vaccinated, the less the virus spreads and the lower chance you have to even come into contact with it."
13442,So do big health corporations sadly.
13443,You can't deny there is alot of money involved in the rollout of these vaccines.
13444,These companies have more to gain by lying than individual reddit users.

13603,You don‚Äôt think counting any death within a month of having covid is over counting?
13604,There was a guy in my town who fell and cracked his head open on the sidewalk.
13605,He died.
13606,But he had covid.
13607,They counted it as a covid death.
13608,"
&gt;And when it comes to vaccines, we can assume that the makers of the vaccines have greater competence than government officials."
13609,Or have greater incentive to boost their stock price by selling more vaccine $hots.

13627,[removed]
13628,My reading of the CDC advice is that if they've caught it they should still isolate from the rest of the household for the recommended period.

13641,"So, yes, that's exactly what I'd prefer before another mask mandate."
13642,"Also, I'd ask this question, did masking prevent any of the waves?"

13686,is death rate going up too ?
13687,Yup.
13688,NL had reopened everything suddenly (US is also fully open for a while now I think).
13689,But delta was also the majority of cases a week earlier than in the US.
13690,While the US overall also has fully vaccinated more people as of 2 weeks ago (which matters for protection levels against delta).
13691,"So it all exploded here, youth partying everywhere with a single dose Janssen (basically 0% testing) or a leaky test system, while the rest of the population overall got basically all of their freedoms back, while delta became the majority, lead to a mix creating this spike."
13692,"On the other hand, levels of deaths and hospitalisations are still at an extremely low level, and it is believed it will not increase in the same way as cases did, as the explosion of cases is almost exclusively caused by the youth, which is mostly partially vaccinated now or not at all."
13693,While the more vulnerable people and older people are not seeing a huge rise in cases and have almost all been fully vaccinated.
13694,Currently the Netherlands sees 1 death and &lt;7 hospital admissions per day on average over the last 7 days.
13695,"On almost 10,000 cases and a population of 17.5 million."
13696,Those are still pretty good stats.
13697,"However, cases are just terrifying atm."
13698,And now we have Delta+ and Lamda‚Ä¶the variant that has emerged in Peru ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è These two variants have occurred in ~a month and a half!
13699,Ugh.
13700,Ah... good point.

13705,First time clubs and bars fully opened and apparently a lot of people faked their required corona free test results to get in.
13706,"Our government also decided the Janssen vaccine shot was enough to go clubbing the next day, before immunity."
13707,Literally no-one is wearing masks anymore or worrying about distancing (I am one of the only ones still wearing a mask in grocery stores and ill continue doing that till a few weeks after i get my second shot).
13708,Working from home mostly stopped.
13709,underestimation of the rapidily spreading Delta variant.
13710,Combine that with our general lack off wanting to follow rules and you got a jackpot going.
13711,"If anything this pandemic has taught me to go with my own gut even more, instead of following general guidelines which always seemed to be 1-4 months behind Reddit :)"

13715,I might be stupid but it's not just vaccination that's a problem.
13716,People don't realize you don't suddenly stop spreading corona if you are vaccinated.
13717,Nor will it stop you getting it.
13718,Looking at the data the 7 day average did get to 330 for a week or so and is now back up to 430.
13719,A 33% increase.
13720,"On June 10th it was 579, has your behavior since then changed?"
13721,"I would not consider any of this sky high yet, but it may be something to keep an eye on for the next few weeks."
13722,In my county in MD during the entire month of June 95% of cases were unvaccinated people.
13723,So far most of the data I have seen around the country has 90% of cases being unvaxed individuals.

13743,Did you try it for New York City?
13744,Unreal.
13745,I pretty strongly disagree with this.
13746,When people are hospitalized they check if it‚Äôs covid.
13747,There‚Äôs a number of professions where you have to get tested regularly regardless of vaccine status.
13748,And especially as they were doing trials they would see if vaccinated people got sick.
13749,If vaccinated people were getting it much we‚Äôd know.
13750,That is because doctors are telling us (people with inflammatory responses) that they won't guarantee it is due to the vaccine.
13751,"That is the first time I have seen this stat and, just like many of the other ""it's fine"" stats, I no longer believe what they are telling us."
13752,They will..
13753,They already tightened restrictions a bit.
13754,But tbh it's really a lost cause.
13755,People are morons here.
13756,And government never should have lowered restrictions like this.
13757,They dropped everything and expected it was gonna be fine.
13758,But cash money right.
13759,They just needed money to start flowing again.
13760,Stuff closed = losing money
13761,That's one of the more stupid sub rules I've seen...
13762,"Just google walvax covid vaccine, there are plenty of links to info about clinical trials etc"
13763,"Yeah exactly, not an intelligent idea..."
13764,Hang in there.
13765,"There are others, just not that many others."
13766,Actually within Europe you just mentioned the only two possible contenders I really see.
13767,"After looking more closely at uptake data I will revise by ""bet"" as: 1st Denmark, 2nd Spain, 3rd Portugal, 4th Ireland."
13768,But then I am mostly following closely some European countries and perhaps suddenly Singapore (for example) gets ahead of everyone...
13769,Pretty much all age groups in the Netherlands seem to be getting there.
13770,"So maybe not all over the world, but in the Netherlands, the subject of this discussion 80+% is starting to look very feasible."
13771,"And Nepal, Bangladesh, Malaysia..."
13772,"Yeah, I know the story."
13773,I was responding to your gym fearmongering comment.
13774,They can't use AZ in younger people because of the blood-clotting issue.
13775,And the government was not clever enough (or too stingy) to diversify their vaccine portfolio early on through more contracts/purchases.
13776,"With everyting they order now, they have to join the end of the queue."
13777,[removed]
13778,You can't make someone else sick and die with your obesity.
13779,That's why the vaccine is important.
13780,"You can use math to calculate how likely would that increase be seen by chance, and it's too unlikely that this is by chance."
13781,Is no one vaccinated there?
13782,Wtf?
13783,"As far as I know, there are no known cases of outdoor transmission where the infected person didn't spend 5+ minutes in close contact with whoever they got it from."
13784,But am I behind the times?
13785,"Are there any known cases of casual outdoor transmission, where someone got it from someone without being close to them for a significant amount of time?"
13786,"Ok. Say, you didn't happen to read the article that's linked at the top of this page did you?"
13787,Did you see the statistics?
13788,But you won't know how many of those would have died anyway until you can subtract the below-expected deaths in the coming years.
13789,"Like from the NHS data, 92% of deaths were over 60, and 55% over 80 - the vast majority with pre-existing conditions (mainly diabetes, dementia and heart disease)."
13790,"A lot of those people would have died from those pre-existing conditions within these years anyway, and now will result in below-average deaths in the post-COVID years."
13791,"[NHS figures](https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/covid-19-daily-deaths/):

From the 1st July 2021:  

Age | % PE Condition | % Total Deaths

13792,She's not sufficiently protected.
13793,"Seems perfectly fair, though unfortunate, that she's not considered fully vaccinated."
13794,You're far more likely to contract and die from covid than a side effect from a vaccine.
13795,"They eased restrictions for election and religious festivals, correct?"
13796,99.5% that is damn compelling..
13797,I am betting the testing is around the same
13798,Dumbasses
13799,Also az also used a half dose protocol.
13800,I wonder why drug companies aren't running new trials testing smaller doses.
13801,Right i mean someone knocks on your door and you dont want it you say no thank u and move on.
13802,I am still getting emails from my state to get a jab even though i have had both so i just ignore them now.
13803,One hand not telling the other hand what is going on.
13804,I really dont understand why one side is making this so hard.

13871,"I'm addition to what was said, everyone who wanted to visit event or club had to do a test so 100's of thousands of people went testing."
13872,That obviously showed much more infections which wouldn't be noticed before.
13873,Yeah that is pants on head dumb
13874,I was hearing that Florida was trying to not count visitors.
13875,It absolutely is.
13876,Our hospitals were at max capacity for ICU beds during the big wave.
13877,That‚Äôs very abnormal for every other illness.
13878,The fact that happened should tell you something about how dangerous COVID is.
13879,I never said January 2021 was not horrible?
13880,"What I am saying is that it is wrong to say that July is as bad (or we would have to ""go back"" to January) simply because there are two days (currently) that have had cases above 10,000."
13881,"The reason I am saying this, as I have pointed out in my previous replies, is because the number of people vaccinated today is nowhere near the same as it was in January 2021."
13882,Vaccinations are relevant to the discussion.
13883,"The vaccine is effective against hospitalizations and deaths, as well as provides protection against the Delta Variant."
13884,Can this story be verified?
13885,You forgot get decimal
13886,Thanks for the article.
13887,"There appear to be two small studies, one with 8 and the other with 20 people."

13899,People didn't deny polio.
13900,They didn't deny that there was a swine flu.
13901,We did have education.
13902,We had good presidents like Gerald Ford and Dwight Eisenhower and John Kennedy.
13903,But in a way they're just role models.
13904,How do we get deniers to stop denying?
13905,Even when they're threatening their own lives...

13907,"&gt; I also think they might be the first countries to vaccinate 80% of total (yes, not adult or eligible) population."
13908,Iceland and Malta and maybe a few others have a good chance of being number 1.
13909,Lol.
13910,the Vatican also if they are not already.
13911,There is very little vaccine hesitancy in Portugal.
13912,"It rankles a bit to see other Eu countries, who theoretically get the same proportion of vaccines as Portugal being vaccinating under 18s or 18-25 year olds."
13913,"Under 25s can not even get a booking yet, and a lot of over 40s are only now just getting their first shots."
13914,We are still lucky compared to most of  the rest of the world though.
13915,And we are in a race with delta.
13916,Let us just hope vaccine suppliers do not fail and keep delivering as they promised.
13917,"man, i wouldn‚Äôt be so upset about it if this didn‚Äôt put such a strain on the healthcare and mortuary systems and if these people were the only ones who would be hurt by this shit, rather than the public health employees who will have to treat them and vulnerable people who can‚Äôt get the vaccine for some reason; not to mention, the longer this thing maintains community spread, the more likely it will spawn new variants that could be even worse, and that the vaccine might not work as well on."
13918,"because of course, they talk all big about it being ‚Äúno big deal‚Äù and that public health measures infringe on ‚Äúdur freedoms,‚Äù but the second they actually get sick, they will be the first in line at the hospital to get treatment üôÑ"
13919,"Less ppl will get tested in the upcomming weeks, since a lot of these tests where event/clubs based tests."
13920,Today alone 50k test appointments where cancelled.
13921,Also a lot of asymptonic ppl got tested positive and these are not the ones ending up in hospitals.
13922,I assume there will be some rise in the hospitals again but the current highest group of infected ppl dont end up in hospital and the ones that did are mostly vaccinated at this point and should be ok. That is if the vaccines do what their makers claim they do ...

13927,Cruiseliner sideliner?
13928,The Delta-Santis variant?
13929,So you‚Äôve taken a vaccine and still think you are at risk?
13930,Then why take the vaccine?
13931,"I‚Äôm not trying to troll I‚Äôm just trying to see it from others point of view, I‚Äôm struggling to see why I should get the vaccine at the moment."
13932,Eh its Florida
13933,"It may not be able to mandated, but it can be mandated for things like returning to workplaces, and I hope, for returning to colleges."
13934,"Colleges and Universities already have mandatory vaccine schedules, so it wouldn't be a big stretch to add it."
13935,"That would pretty much eliminate the surges in 18-30 year olds being seen right now, at least in the USA."
13936,"I had swine flu in 2013, and although I had flu a few times prior, I felt like I was going to die."
13937,I did not go to the ER but I cannot recall feeling so bad in my life.

13948,uBlock Origin.
13949,Yea you should go get vaccinated.
13950,Not sure I understood the second question.
13951,If you get COVID again (possible but very rare) then you will carry it and possibly transmit it.
13952,But unless you have symptoms or know you were near someone who had COVID I would not worry about it.
13953,"If you have family with these people, you know that they are likely willing to sever a connection over difference in beliefs."
13954,Or at the very least it will hurt your connection a lot if you stand up to them.
13955,Usually you have like no chance to correct their beliefs.
13956,Saying you respect their beliefs is a way to not ruin your connection with them over this.
13957,Yeah vaccine needles are about the smallest we use.
13958,25g I think.
13959,You can barely suck up liquid in them.
13960,I think sometimes if they are drawing up the vaccine they will draw with a bigger needle and then switch to the vaccine needle because they draw so slow.
13961,You can barely get blood through them but sure you can def get a microchip.
13962,"Haven't seen a lot of posts or articles on the J&amp;J efficacy against the Delta, but data so far looks really promising."

13964,"While I'm surprised that LA County only has 69% of eligible people vaxxed with one dose (16+) (for reference, San Francisco is 82% for 12+), if numbers soar in LA, a LOT of places are going to get hit at least as hard."

14227,Antivaxxers are choosing to be scared of the proven short / medium term (which as pointed elsewhere is historically speaking all that is relevant ) side effects which are statistically speaking very palatable.
14228,"We do know what the short medium and long term effects of COVID-19 are, and anyone who reviews all available data to make their decision simply cannot choose to not get the jab."
14229,"Btw, I was hesitant until the trial phases were successfully completed, and I wouldn‚Äôt have faulted anyone who was in that camp until data was freely available proving that concerns about the vaccines was for naught."

14240,I know this is hard to understand but sometimes people change their mind based on data.
14241,When Bidens team knew a federal mask mandate would most likely not survive SCOTUS and would likely cause more trouble than it was worth they changed their mind..
14242,"It's a state issue and even the states that mandated it had an extremely, if not impossible time , enforcing it

14255,"I had a minor case in March/April of 2020, which was uncomfortable but not terrible, but there was a lingering cough."
14256,A year later was able to get a pulmonary fitness test due to that noisome cough.

14263,That is my point.
14264,He should not.
14265,"No vaccine is 100% efficient particularly with delta, even after two doses, and gyms are a place of particular emission of infectious particles."
14266,OP needs to do their own risk analysis.
14267,"Israeli data, which might have methodological issues puts protection after two doses of Pfizer at 66%."
14268,That is far away from 100%.
14269,Other data from Canada and UK puts it at best at 88-92%.
14270,That is not 100%.
14271,"Plus you do not know OP¬¥s age, weight, race and other favors."

14275,Is everybody double vaccinated 100% safe against the delta variant in areas with an outbreak of it?
14276,No.
14277,"Not, a 100% for sure."
14278,"And vaccination is still a good, best choice possible even if does not guarantee 100% invulnerability."
14279,Turning vaccination into a all-or-nothing protection thing is seriously wrong.

14295,Vaccinated people do need them.
14296,That's the problem.

14330,Russia is a menace that needs to be dealt with harshly.
14331,391 families in the US have lost their kids to trips and falls.

14335,So do you think we shut down society unless there are zero preventable deaths or what.
14336,It is working very well just the amount of vaccinated is very low
14337,Why?
14338,It's a simple way to get back to normal things.

14344,All the elderly in my country had a chance to get vaccinated months ago.
14345,Those who didn‚Äôt get the jab did it solely based on their convictions.
14346,100% of them are eligible with no waitlist.
14347,"There are several pro vaccination drives trying to convince them, ‚Ä¶

As bad as it sounds there‚Äôs no cure for stupid and we can only mourn the dead."
14348,No... please reread the comment.
14349,Only 100 vaccinated people are even infected in the scenario because the reduction in infection stacks with the reduction in hospitalizations.
14350,So it was a 92% reduction in the hospitalization RATE.
14351,So if we had 15% before it is 15*.08 or 1.2%.
14352,"With 100 people and a rate 1.2%, you would see about 1 infection."
14353,"Only if my example include 10,000 vaccinated people and 1,000 unvaccinated people would you see 12 hospitalized vaccinated people."
14354,"Also a teacher and my school announced recently that we don‚Äôt need to wear masks if we‚Äôre vaccinated, but also we aren‚Äôt going to ask if you‚Äôre vaccinated."
14355,I know for a fact that several of my colleagues are unmasked and unvaccinated.
14356,It‚Äôs just summer school right now but it won‚Äôt change in the fall when the building is full.
14357,"We wore masks this past year but it‚Äôs looking like we won‚Äôt in the fall, and considering our students are too young to be vaccinated I don‚Äôt understand what has changed for them."

14369,I'd be happier with a higher number.
14370,Kids also get the flu or colds.
14371,"You don‚Äôt worry about your kid dying from myocarditis when they have those, do you?"
14372,But you are 100% right about vaccinating kids under 12.
14373,There isn‚Äôt much data here.
14374,"But it's not unknown...current research shows it's safe, especially compared to the alternative of catching COVID while being unvaccinated."
14375,To say it's unknown implies they shipped vaccines out to everyone without having a single idea of what would happen in the long term.
14376,"As for the Fauci claim, it's completely irrelevant to what we're talking about."
14377,"But if it were:

14378,YES IT IS TRUE FOR COVID.
14379,i dont know why people don‚Äôt understand that dying from severe covid complications is probably the best outcome.
14380,some of the long term effects of covid (even in young people) appear to be debilitating life altering issues.
14381,this heart inflammation is actually more common in covid patients than it is in vaccinated people.
14382,there are no risks for young people getting this vaccine unless you have a severe allergy to one of the ingredients get your head out of the sand
14383,OK.
14384,It's 85% less chance of getting sick than if you weren't vaccinated.
14385,That's not 100% less chance.
14386,This means some people are going to get sick.
14387,It's happening.
14388,"It's not like an unvaccinated person has a 0% chance of getting sick, either."
14389,"33 million people in the US have contracted it so far, and over 600,000 have died."
14390,"The information in the article isn't just fear-mongering (although maybe the headline is): it's a reminder that highly effective vaccines are highly effective, but not bulletproof."
14391,"As a vaccinated person, the chance of getting sick on a dance floor full of unmasked, vaccination-status-unknown people is higher than the chance of getting sick going about normal activities where people are masked and/or vaccinated and/or physically distant from other people."
14392,"Nobody's saying stay at home and hide under your bed, but that you might want to reconsider activities that are higher-risk."

14394,"&gt;Only 21 of the COVID-19 cases were sequenced to determine what version of the coronavirus caused them, but all of those samples were identified as the highly contagious delta variant, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report published Friday."
14395,"&gt;The outbreak, which occurred between April 15 and May 3, adds to existing evidence that suggests the delta variant has higher attack rates than other variants of concern, meaning it can infect more people after exposure."
14396,I wonder why this is just being reported now?
14397,It was about 3 months ago.
14398,&gt;The attack rate among infected gymnasts and staff members was 20% and 53% among their household contacts.
14399,"&gt;Forty of the infected people were unvaccinated, three were partially vaccinated with one dose completed and four were fully vaccinated."
14400,"Those who were infected ranged from 5 to 58 years old, though the median age was 14."
14401,‚Ä¶
14402,"Could those cases also just be caused by something else, or do we know for sure it was the vaccine?"
14403,"The ""man versus man"" narrative is a lot more interesting story to talk about."

14405,"The ""man versus nature"" story is less interesting."
14406,"Theres no bad guy, and the only moral is that sometimes nature kills people."
14407,[deleted]
14408,I did read the full statement.
14409,It‚Äôs hard for me to understand how a booster wouldn‚Äôt be needed at this time when the delta variant is infecting fully vaccinated individuals.
14410,It‚Äôs possible that the infection rate in fully vaccinated individuals is low enough to not cripple public health infrastructure and services and that‚Äôs the lens that Fauci is viewing this through.
14411,"But as someone with small children under 5, I don‚Äôt want to give Covid to my kids."

&gt; Eight people under the age of 50 died after getting the Delta variant, the data showed."
14417,"None was fully vaccinated, while two had received one dose of the vaccine."
14418,Wait until it gets into pockets of unvaccinated people and there's gunna be mayhem in fall

14424,"Fully vaccinated Texas man would be a better headline, especially with so many only with one dose."
14425,It tends to happen a lot with viruses.
14426,"I read somewhere (can't remember, definitely not a scholarly source, so take it with a pinch of salt) that it was a result of the body mounting an immune response."
14427,"Of course, your body mounts an immune response to all sorts of things, and viruses seem to be the only major contributor."
14428,"The point is, it's not specifically *vaccine* related."
14429,They are concluding that it evolved naturally.
14430,They are saying that a lab leak is plausible.
14431,"So, in theory, they could have isolated a naturally occurring virus and then a worker contacted the virus accidently."
14432,This would make both of those statements true.
14433,Just keep telling deniers that unvaccinated people account for 99% of recent covid deaths.
14434,I don't claim to have any answers.
14435,But what I do know is the inventor of the MRNA technology is on record saying don't get the vaccine right now if you are young.
14436,He's read the pharmaceutical report that Japan received and believes there is a possibility of long term effects from the vaccine.
14437,You can't possibly know more about the MRNA vaccine then the inventor of the MRNA vaccine technology.
14438,He's not claiming there will definitely be long term effects but believes there is a probability of there being autoimmune diseases and possible cancer relating to the vaccine which would take 2-5 years to show up.
14439,I think I'll listen to him when he says more research needs to be done.
14440,Category risk and tail risk is what matters.
14441,"Not stupid mean or median like a study or article claiming a ‚Äú10 fold event‚Äù 

I‚Äôm by no means a no vax but one has got to wonder what his own risk/benefit profile is."
14442,There‚Äôs a reason why vaccines are not ruled OK for kids and why the oms said it‚Äôs not clear for teenagers either.
14443,If you are 25 with no pathologies your risk of dying of covid is negligible.
14444,"Getting a viral myocarditis detectable and gone once the virus is is not the same as getting one that is unpredictable, vaccine induced and with grave consequences, however small the chances may be."
14445,This and absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.
14446,Meaning some effects may take a long long time to be noticed.
14447,And just because nothing too worrisome has shown up in the data it means that it‚Äôs not there without a question.
14448,Obviously for society as a whole this is not a big concern and vaccines yield a huge positive overall.
14449,"For the individual, ones gotta be careful with all the ‚Äúscience based‚Äù facts out there."
14450,Do you have any sources that say these studies are invalidated?

14461,"Here in my country, you can get an appointment right away if you are above 18 years old or you don't even need to take an appointment just go to the hospital or vaccine centers at the shopping malls or city center and get your vaccine but for some reason people are not willing to take it."
14462,This is bad because I think they risk the life of vaccinated people as well.
14463,If enough people not getting vaccinated virus continues to mutate and this risks the efficacy of vaccines that are available.
14464,I am not sure for the sake of many may be vaccination should be made mandatory.
14465,Quite
14466,"yes, the trend is that vaccinated people get a disease, and because they are vaccinated, the disease has little or limited effect."
14467,That is how vaccinations have always worked.
14468,[deleted]
14469,Up 15% in the last month.
14470,But you weren't posting in good faith so that won't change your mind.
14471,Four

14473,Let's hope it doesn't translate to a big increase in hospitalizations as most of these rising cases are in the 0-29 age group whilst every other age group is still declining
14474,"I mean, they fired those nurses in Texas who refused to get vaccinated."
14475,"Honestly, if you are a healthcare worker and refuse to get vaccinated, you probably shouldn't be anywhere near a healthcare job."
14476,You definitely SHOULD be fired.
14477,[This article](https://www.news-journalonline.com/story/news/coronavirus/2021/07/08/covid-delta-variant-now-volusia-flagler-st-johns-counties-florida/7899794002/) says hospitalizations were up 13% a week ago.
14478,Not really finding much more recent info.
14479,"Cases in Florida started rising a few weeks ago, currently double what they were 2-3 weeks ago, so since hospitalizations will lag a bit we'll probably have to wait a few more weeks to see if they also climb."
14480,I figured you know.
14481,I also assume you told her all this.
14482,I just don't get why this is so hard to grasp for some people.
14483,The world doesn't revolve around you.
14484,Not everyone who hasn't been vaccinated is anti-vax.
14485,"Some people are allergic or immune-compromised, etc."
14486,Throwing caution to the wind is just adding vaccinated cases to the growing unvaccinated one's.

14488,"To do that, we need to put the oil companies in check, as it is they will defeat any half measures to produce alternative energy."
14489,"We need new ways of pooling capital and operating businesses that don't rely soley on the profit margin, private benefit corporations that can find new better ways of making energy and bring them to the market en masse, the oil companies can't stop that, anything that involves politicians they can."
14490,Oh i know that - I am just saying what she said to me
14491,[removed]
14492,[removed]
14493,"Yes, and they ousted her for that."
14494,None of this is funny.
14495,Do they at least get unemployment benefits?
14496,[removed]
14497,People aren‚Äôt usually hospitalized for non-severe disease.
14498,What‚Äôs being talked about here is preventing hospitalizations.
14499,You realize people don't experience much of that for COVID either right?
14500,"I understand and trust me I have the same frustrations, but continue to show them love."
14501,Has talking in person helped at all?
14502,Just noticing more and more arguing is making it even worse.
14503,elon musk saying stuff is not a source
14504,"With COVID, isn‚Äôt serious illness usually on the side of 0.001% rather than 1%, especially when vaccinated?"
14505,You point to something very concerning.
14506,There‚Äôs a lot of inference and ‚Äúshould‚Äù in your comment but what studies are being done to understand if what you‚Äôre purporting as fact is what‚Äôs *actually* happening.
14507,Happy to read any links you can share but I haven‚Äôt found any.
14508,"Yes, on paper that‚Äôs what SHOULD happen."
14509,"But when the rubber meets the road, as you know, things don‚Äôt always work out the way they do on paper."
14510,However when you say vaccination turns Covid into a mild cold (or allergies?)
14511,you have nothing to substantiate those claims other than inference and supposition.
14512,I'm wondering the same thing.
14513,Hopefully there's some evidence behind it.
14514,That would be incredible news!
14515,"While that is true, there‚Äôs tons of unvaccinated people around the world to allow new variants to develop."
14516,"Florida or Texas are way better off than India, for example."
14517,You‚Äôd need to vaccinate the entire world to stop that angle.
14518,"Yeah, people confuse this type of information a lot and no surprise that the media is enjoying it."
14519,For example the israeli study that rang many alarms due to the 65% efficcency was only for infections.
14520,Asymptomatic infection still remains in the 90% just as before.
14521,"Now the real question is what we do with children and inmunocompromised who can still get COVID as a result of the viral load in those asymptomatic, in which boosters and full government approval for children vaccines come in handy."
14522,"But the cat is already out of the bag, 2020 lockdowns/mandates are not gonna happen again."
14523,Holy shit.
14524,"I had it and for me it was just my heart beating irregularly, like it skipped a beat every few minutes."
