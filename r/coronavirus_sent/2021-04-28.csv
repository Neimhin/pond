0,You set goals you are going to meet.
1,That way you win before you even start.
2,Biden has done this repeatedly with his vaccine X by Y day goals.
3,"He only sets those when he knows we have stuff in place to way exceed those ""goals."""
4,Then he auto wins.
5,Ending mask mandates indoors in 2021 is a mistake IMO.
6,Once the mandate is lifted it‚Äôs almost impossible to put back in place and we may need them over the fall and winter.
7,Testing is not a metric worth much.
8,I don't know why people obsess over the raw number of tests.
9,[removed]
10,How long should I wait to get a flu shot after the COVID vaccine?
11,[removed]
12,"Off the top of my head, that sounds like my city's ratio as well."
13,"I think this is only not true in the case of small cities, especially those 200+ km away from the coast, but the state has always had extreme difficulty providing significant infrastructure far from the population centers."
14,is anyone surprised?
15,CDC are very conservative with their guidelines.
16,they also say to wear sunscreen every time you go outside and to never eat meat that isn't well done.
17,technically it's not bad advice but most people don't live their lives like that.
18,Great for them.
19,oh shit yea I have to work with the public.
20,"Out of my roughly 30-40 fellow employees, only 1 other also wears a KN95/N95 in place of plain cloth."
21,They're cheap and the kn95 ones are really comfortable.
22,[removed]
23,[removed]
24,I really think people underestimate Twitters detriment to society.
25,"Because we don't really know how effective the vaccines are at reducing transmission, especially with variants."
26,Only that it is good but not 100%.
27,"I don‚Äôt mind wearing a mask while at work, in public, or if a host wants me to."
28,But how is wearing a mask at a party or ‚Äúsmall gathering‚Äù going to do anything?
29,"Most of the danger comes from touching an infected surface and then touching your mouth, eyes, or nose."
30,Just seems really dumb to me.
31,Obviously I‚Äôm not against masks in public though.
32,This is stupid.
33,It took how long to get everyone to use a mask?
34,They should wait until most people have their vaccine and THEN make masks non mandatory.
35,"As it is, you'll have people not wearing theirs at work 'because it's not mandatory anymore""."
36,I've mostly just stayed inside so it hasn't been a big deal for me to look into and I figured they'd be better off in other's hands.
37,You're right though
38,Bruh nobody wants to wear a mask at a bar or concert lol
39,[deleted]
40,What does vaping have to do with this lol
41,"As a New Yorker, I'm so happy we're getting better and better"
42,This could have to do with people getting vaccinated though
43,Baaaaaa
44,Really?
45,So we're not going to follow the CDC guidelines on social distancing?
46,"&gt; Would you also support insurers penalizing overweight people

Yes"
47,Theres a lot of places and people that are going to be Fd up.
48,Its good you voted with your dollars and went somewhere sane.
49,If everyone would just not financially support the insane asylums wed all be better off.
50,"You're right, it's a great place for misinformation pulled directly from the rectum"
51,Yeah my first dose was like that
52,100% at a Rangers game is still like 25% of the stadium lol
53,Exactly!
54,If someone does not want to get vaccinated - it's not the problem of people who got their vaccines.
55,This is the king of crap that keeps people from getting vaccinated - I they see that restrictions are not eased for vaccinated folks then they say what's the point are are likely to skip the vaccine.
56,That entire stretch of road is basically a public bathroom.
57,God bless Rocky's and Greenbush Bakery though
58,There hasn't been a PPE shortage for like a year dude.
59,"And even before that, as long as you're not hoarding, you have just as much of a right to it as everyone else."
60,I bought a P100 full face mask in February 2019.
61,"If only our CDC and the WHO had not lied to us about masks, we might all be wearing them."
62,Thanks üôèüèª
63,Yes.
64,"Remember, most UNVACCINATED people don't wind up in the hospital."
65,"Heck, most unvaccinated people haven't even gotten infected with COVID at all after a year."
66,"So to figure out how effective a vaccine is, you have to compare it to a control group that hasn't gotten the vaccine."
67,"Most of the control group will be fine, too."
68,You just look at the difference to see the vaccine's effect.
69,Yeah you're right.
70,I guess it hadn't occurred to me that it'd be fine to buy them now that there isn't a ppe shortage.
71,How does the mask protect you dining with multiple families?!?!
72,You are sitting talking and eating with no mask on.
73,This is a joke right?
74,LuL buddy adults act like adults.
75,The whole world watching you guys throwing tantrums in Walmart because many of you can't keep a breathable fabric over your face.
76,That's not adult
77,The drop is testing is a problem.
78,We really need to keep testing levels high as we move towards more reopening and fewer restrictions.
79,I'm thinking I'm getting around one in a thousand false positives.
80,Though I'm in a unique setting.
81,I have seen three positives in the last month that clearly do not have an active infection .
82,Each of them already had Covid and each of them is fully vaccinated.
83,once the limits of the vaccine are known as far as length maybe more people will feel okay with things too.
84,idk
85,My city has 575k and 52 clinics (UBS).
86,That would be 1 per 11k.
87,"(Not counting here UPA, Hospitals or other clinics)."
88,197 vaccinated people have died so far from covid.
89,Which is pretty good considering it's like 100 million vaccinated
90,"We don't really know how good the vaccines are, or if they'll work against mutations."
91,But you can't be that honest with people or else they won't follow you.
92,"Also, don't discard the maks after everyone is vaccinated."
93,Better keep them for flu season.
94,"&gt;permeating the race

Bait alert"
95,Absolute hogwash.
96,"There are precisely zero places in the world capable of ""creating vaccine on their own"" that aren't already doing it."
97,"There is no supply chain available to support it, and it would take many years to build it out."
98,"You can't just plop down a warehouse, mix some ingredients together, and start producing vaccine."
99,The multi-national conglomerates that are expert at this are struggling to build out their supply chains.
100,"In India, the world's largest vaccine supplier, Serum Institute is trying to produce Oxford/AstraZeneca's easier-to-make vaccine, but they are operating at much below capacity, because they don't have the supplies."
101,"Merck is going to start producing Johnson and Johnson's vaccine under contract, but they won't start shipping vaccine until mid-2022."
102,"It's really incredible to me that after the world's best effort in history to combat a novel contagion, a wildly successful effort such as has never before been seen, still people are looking for villains."
103,"I meant ""your"" as in anyone acting like that"
104,Maybe they have workers at higher risk or who aren't vaccinated.
105,You could get a real mask.
106,An N95 or KN95 mask will actually protect you.
107,It's not perfect but it's better than the fashionable pieces of garbage cloth that 99% of people wear.
108,"Funny, sounds like there bottle return credit."
109,I have no doubt it's lower because it has only been available for a few weeks to them.
110,But I also expect there to be more hesitancy the younger the age group.
111,Also whose going to go bother to get tested after getting a vaccine?
112,I didn't even bother to get tested after the first time I thought I had it.
113,It took 4 days for the test and another 3 to get the results back.
114,Lot of good that did.
115,&gt;The pharmacist told me I was the only person scheduled for the week.
116,I guess they poured the rest of the vial of vax down the drain.
117,Sad!
118,I have no training in any health-related field.
119,"Now, there has been a theory that the blood clots seen in J&amp;J and AZ vaccines are partially influenced by getting the injection in a blood vessel, and you may have gotten it in a blood vessel."
120,"However, rest assured because 1) it's not the case with Pfizer, and 2) that theory is probably either wrong, or there has to be the perfect confluence of many other factors along with the blood vessel thing to cause clotting because out of the hundreds of millions of doses give, and significant portion of those would be in a blood vessel and you can count the problems on your fingers."
121,"In short, I'm not a doctor, but if I were you I wouldn't be worried at all."
122,"Like, not at all."

135,My family members who refuse to wear a mask and still sneeze into their hands?
136,Nothing.
137,I mentioned some of this (in many fewer words) in another comment.
138,This makes me laugh
139,"If you‚Äôre vaccinated, the chance of a breakthrough case is really, really small."
140,"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/health-departments/breakthrough-cases.html

&gt; As of April 20, 2021, more than 87 million people in the United States had been fully vaccinated against COVID-19."
141,"&gt;Total number of vaccine breakthrough infections reported to CDC: 7,157"
142,Maybe if they ever get substantial data that shows that vaccinated people don't pose a risk in spreading infections.
143,"We know vaccinated people have a low risk of getting sick; if there's also a low risk of being a transmission vector, I don't think there would be any reason to wear a mask."
144,"&gt;The difference is that this bit of theatre actually works

150,"No problem, It's even stated in the rules that I did read."
151,"Kind of embarrassing actually, turns out I submited accidentally to this sub and only just noticed."
152,I had also prepared to submit to UK sub and turns out if you load a draft submission in Rif app it does not limit to the drafts of the sub your on at the time and did not notice the absence of the UK when clicking submit.
153,I had previously setup a draft on this sub before I double checked the rules and abandoned the idea.
154,So I short can apparently read rules but not my own submission.
155,"Seriously, what's the point of getting vaccinated if you are still required to wear a mask?"
156,you get fired if you say no.
157,It's almost like this whole thing is a farce and we as a society care more about the economic and social implications of all of this rather than healthcare.
158,We kept mcdonalds open through the whole pandemic.
159,That should tell you everything you need to know.

165,"I think many states won't be able to reach herd immunity because of skepticism, unfortunately."
166,Not to say they won't reopen eventually but it will just lead to so many unnecessary deaths.
167,Antivax = Murder
168,...because the virus did what the vaccines do - train your immune system to recognize the virus and prompt a faster response from additional exposures - it's just that the virus does more damage in the process.
169,"And now there is some scientific data to back up already established knowledge about how immunity works after an infection, and backs up the reason why I was always annoyed and frustrated by the people who would catch COVID and then run off to get a vaccine afterwards, which effectively denied another person that protection earlier - they already had the same protection from future infection."
170,"I don't blame those people, since most governments are still pegging reopening based on vaccinations, I can't expect every layperson to be versed in every aspect of medical science, and those people will probably want to get on a plane at some point in the future; this is more of a personal problem that I have with a resource like vaccines not being utilized to their full potential, in this case potentially resulting in slightly more infections, more deaths, and a longer time to return to normal."

180,"Look at this study

181,Do you think this is going to overwhelm hospitals?
182,Children in the US are more mature than the adults from a certain segment of that society.
183,People from that spectrum complain more than anyone else!
184,"I fully agree with you, I was trying to get /u/darkfuryelf to think about it, since his comment implies there is *no* risk for spread from vaccinated people."
185,No data showing fully vaccinated people can spread implies that there is no data showing that they do NOT spread covid as well.
186,"Thus, cautions still need to be taken until that data is available."
187,lets be real - anti-vax people aren't listening to CDC messages.
188,"Instead, lets give 10 free Powerball lottery tickets to people when they get the vaccine."
189,That will bring in the people who don't understand statistics.
190,You and me both.
191,Makes it hard to trust anything.
192,"If they work, people who have it should be able to safely go back to their normal lives."
193,Saying that‚Äôs not the case makes people less likely to want to get them.
194,They‚Äôre getting in their own way.
195,Sure.
196,But this is reddit.
197,Small scope by default.
198,"Yeah, in my state people 16 plus have only been eligable for 8 days, it's still impossible for them to be fully vaccinated unless they had J&amp;J"
199,I am surprised some places have issues with people getting their second dose.
200,I used to figure that if people were willing to get the first they would double down.
201,Your comment is a little patronizing.
202,"My comment was to get people to think about why the CDC is issuing this guidance, not to question the guidance."
203,"One person is being downvoted for saying there is a potential for vaccinated people to still spread covid, and then the reply he gets is ""there's no evidence that fully vaccinated people can spread it""."
204,"This is technically true, but the contrary is also true then: there's no evidence that fully vaccinated people don't spread it."
205,"Yet the cautious person is at -10, and the misleading statement is at +10."
206,"Everyone including,  historically speaking, our worst vectors-kids."
207,"Still got to mask up in meantime, vaxxed or not if we truly care about covid ending."
208,Anybody who pays attention to CDC guidelines is getting the vaccine anyway.
209,"I really don't understand how people can think ""if only the CDC says something a bit different, people won't be anti-vax."""
210,"Yeah, I did go somewhere else."
211,That's not the point of my post though
212,I'm surprised to see this coming from CNN.
213,Maybe the tide is finally turning.
214,Really Sherlock?
215,It's about proposing normality.
216,"For example, I've been going to bars or restaurants with a mask on when you stand up for months."
217,It's fine.
218,But it doesn't seem normal.
219,"If you can motivate people with normality, you should."

221,"I think a good in between approach would be to say ""if demand falls below a certain level we open things up""."
222,At a certain point we are going to hit a plateau in how many people want to get one and if the goal for the vaccinated percentage is too high then states will be stuck in limbo or have to adjust their reopening plans.

233,"Was previously infected with COVID in May 2020, tested positive for antibodies at that time, got my first and 2nd dose of the vaccine, was informed that I wasn‚Äôt injected with the correct quantity of my 2nd dose, so had to get a ‚Äú3rd‚Äù dose."
234,I hope this means I have literally all all all of the power now.
235,I've said in other places why that's my situation.
236,Vaccination isn't 100% and I'd be more comfortable if the people around me were likely to be vaccinated or were keeping distant and masked.
237,"Since georgia is still low in total vaccinations, I'm not ready to be around that many people in close quarters yet."
238,Probably about another month and we'll be to a place where I'm comfortable with it.
239,"I'm a weird risk profile, not exactly high risk, though."
240,Viral illnesses cause issues with my chronic condition.
241,Even mild covid could kick off a flare that would leave me sick for a year (that's what the flu does to me).
242,So I'm trying to be super careful.
243,I mean 94-95% efficiency that‚Äôs to be expected given their large population
244,I was late a week after my first pfizer dose.
245,"I chalked it up to stress as that has happened in the past, but kind of rarely and not in recent years at all."

247,Yes.
248,"Hey your the one who advocated for just letting the government do whatever it wants in the name of public safety, not me."
249,Just wear your fucking mask.
250,I‚Äôm vaccinated.
251,At this point being forced to wear a mask feels ridiculous.
252,The virus is always going to be here.
253,"At first I was all aboard the mask train, but I‚Äôm vaccinated."
254,"It‚Äôs not giving extra protection to me by wearing it, and it‚Äôs not protecting others."
255,If you get infected that‚Äôs on you.
256,It literally feels performative whenever I wear it at this point.
257,"This might be a silly question, but I just got my second dose of the vaccine and developed some side effects."
258,"Nothing major, just a fever and chills, some body aches."
259,"My question is, am I in any way contagious while this is going on?"
260,So you think unvaccinated people should be able to do whatever they want?
261,Absolutely agree!
262,Do you feel the same way about other people of other religions?
263,I cannot fake spotting or it coming earlier.
264,"I've legit never spotted before in my life, but both things happened post vaccine."
265,I feel like they're just saying it's not related because they don't know enough about how the immune system reacts with female hormones
266,Then why is the CDC bothering to announce that you won‚Äôt need a mask while walking or running outside alone?
267,It just made me laugh - y‚Äôall are real sensitive in this group lol
268,Thank you for this article.
269,Haha no its not.
270,"If that was true, we would have all been wearing masks anytime we had the flu, cuz there was a chance we could have given it to somebody that would die."

272,I meant because you're talking out of your ass.
273,In Atlanta you can walk right into the Falcons stadium with no appointment and have a vaccine in 30 minutes.
274,It‚Äôs been like that for like 3 weeks.
275,Anybody that prioritized  having a vaccine probably already has both shots by now.
276,Me and multiple friends do.
277,There is a reason that children are not receiving vaccines right now.
278,Because it is so incredibly unlikely that they will be harmed from the virus that it doesn‚Äôt make logical sense.
279,You know what else doesn‚Äôt make logical sense?
280,An elderly person not having a vaccine when they could have gotten one months ago.
281,"These scenarios you mention are extremely, extremely improbable."
282,"So much so that if we are going to take extra precautions for these unlikely scenarios, we might as well be walking around with rubber suits on so we don‚Äôt get struck by lightning."
283,&gt;But do you realise how little is being made in the UK?
284,Yes I do.
285,But a share of that little was direly needed 2 months ago.
286,You're right that shipping AZ back and fourth made little sense eventually so just deduct and send over the difference of whatever side owned more.
287,"In this specific case it had made sense because Halix wasn't ready yet afaik (they're approved by EMA for quite a while and are producing, but have still not started shipping)."
288,So it had been like sharing British made doses until Halix can repay the favour so to say.
289,"As others here already mused, this lawsuit now may not be about political point scoring and rather to get a verdict that proves AZ fails the EU, which would be used in a broader lawsuit to come - over compensation or forcing AZ to terminate the contract (which would free up the IP apparently)."
290,"And given the current stand of the British vaccine rollout, forcing AZ to export some UK doses doesn't feel that unfair to me, as long as second doses aren't affected."
291,"And even if we take every British person yet to get an AZ jab into account upfront, there'll be leftovers from the UK's 100m order."
292,So maybe a court order could be used to make AZ supply the EU with that instead of the UK giving it away as it sees fit.
293,In any case I couldn't blame the UK for suing back over contract breaches - that's AZ's problem and not entirely undeserved when you sign two contradicting contracts.
294,Nothing until they open their mouths and start pushing their superiority or their beliefs on others.
295,Girl you do not know how lucky you are that you are that regular!!
296,!
297,This is the weakest most low energy sentiment I‚Äôve ever seen in my life
298,"Haha thanks, thats what i thought."

311,"no one ever required that, it‚Äôs about wearing them when you are near people and can‚Äôt social distance."
312,stop it.
313,&gt; And you can imagine that most of the people who refuse to get the vaccine are the same people who are pandemic deniers and anti-maskers.

319,"I guess when I said low-income, I meant ""not G8"" levels of economic prosperity."
320,Did you even read the article?
321,But freedom to not wear a mask in public during a deadly pandemic is infringing on someone else‚Äôs freedom to live.
322,That trumps freedom from wearing a mask and that‚Äôs fact not opinion.
323,"There's a difference between optimism and ""it mostly only kills old people and barely any kids, stop trying to incite a panic over a bad cold""."
324,I have been told variations of that on too many occasions.
325,Because nobody looked at it in testing or asked about it.
326,"Then women instantly noticed post vaccine once they started talking to each other about it, so it's been getting around by word of mouth."
327,"Mine also came a week earlier after my 1st shot and faked me out by 1st spotting and going away for a day, so that was a fun and pants ruining surprise for me."

342,"Yeah, I was going to ask ""why now""?"
343,"Seems weird given it is winding down in Canada, or at least it's past the worst of it."
344,I was at the braves game the other day.
345,It was great....you can leave your bomb shelter now
346,&gt;Yes an observation of what's actually happening.
347,Not just conjecture on what could happen.
348,General observation means they just took the number of infections divided by the number of vaccinated people in the study.
349,That's a statement about the way in which the study was conducted.
350,"Also, the numbers do not include the chance that an unvaccinated person would be infected, which would not be 100%."
351,"Without that, you can't actually compare the efficacy."
352,If only 1-in-1000 non-vaccinated participants got infected then the vaccinated people are only about 1/15th as lonely to catch it.
353,Context on the numbers is important.
354,"&gt;If in reality vaccinated people are getting covid at a similar rate people are getting struck by lightning then I wouldn't say that is ""a lot of potential""

Again though, that's not what we're actually looking at."
355,"We're looking at how likely they are to catch it compares to the inactivated population, which is not captured in the number you gave."
356,"&gt;Yeah i will say you're both wrong, Although I'm assuming he didn't literally mean 1 in a million and was just using it as a euphemism for very unlikely."
357,"The person also said it was ""virtually impossible"", yet you assume 1-in-a million is a euphemism for very unlikely?"
358,I just got my 2nd shot and have been looking forward to being fully vaccinated.
359,"No, I won‚Äôt wear a freaking mask for the rest of my life even though I‚Äôm vaccinated."
360,The Sinovac is a good option too.
361,India sees 27k dead a day.
362,How many are dying from covid to cause this?
363,Thousands?
364,I also recall reading speculation that exposure to feline coronaviruses was giving some people partial immunity to SARS-CoV-2.
365,I don't know if there were any further developments.
366,"I didn't say a 1:1 percentage....obviously the percentage changer in each wi be different...but the relative change is always 1:1 the same...if adding 1k increased one by 1% and the other by0.75%, the next 1k will do the exact same thing....

You totally can use that percentage because the relationship is linear."
367,"If I know that I need 51% vaccinated to end community spread, then I know that I need 60% of all eligible to get vaccinated (rough numbers for NM for example), so you focus on that and the demographics and how to reach people in the demographic that can actually get the shots...."
368,"Since the relationship between the numbers is direct and simple, looking at either metric naturally implies the other."
369,"USA update on first dose shots:

941,130 first dose shots."
370,"Last week 1,178,600

7 day rolling avg is now 1,178,199."
371,"1,212,123 yesterday."
372,"142.6m age 16+ have first dose - ~53.6% (141.7m - ~53.2% yesterday)

373,So I think we are starting to see early data from the unpause.
374,Hopefully we start to see numbers hold for a little bit once more gets reported.
375,"I mean, do you actually think that's a useful number?"
376,"Because it's like 0.004% , but for the same time period, it's like 0.08% for nonvaccinated people."
377,You can't fix stupid.
378,"Well, no, not necessarily."
379,Once we're all vaccinated we should be safe from even another surge.

Translation ([deepl.com](https://deepl.com)):

The Mainz-based vaccine manufacturer Biontech expects to be able to vaccinate the first schoolchildren in the twelve to 15 age group in just a few weeks."
811,"In Europe, the company is close to submitting the study data for conditional approval, Biontech CEO Uƒüur ≈ûahin told Der Spiegel."
812,"Next Wednesday, he said, an application for approval for children aged twelve and older should be submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA)."
813,The first vaccinations could then be available from the beginning of June.
814,The Biontech boss also has hope for a vaccine for younger children in the near future.
815,"""In July, the first results could be available for five- to twelve-year-olds, and in September for younger children; the evaluation will take about four to six weeks."""
816,"If all goes well, the company could then submit regulatory applications."
817,"""We believe things can move quickly now."""
818,"So far, the Biontech vaccine has been approved in Europe only for adolescents and adults 16 and older."
819,"In children aged 12 and older, the Biontech vaccine was 100 percent effective and well tolerated, according to initial study data."
820,"This indicates ""that children are particularly well protected by vaccination,"" he told Der Spiegel."
821,"In the clinical trial of efficacy in younger children, vaccination is given by descending age if the children tolerate the vaccine well."
822,"In the meantime, the researchers are at the youngest age group with children from six months, he said."
823,"Childhood and adult vaccinations differ in the amount of vaccine given, according to the report."
824,"Younger ones would get a lower dosage, and very young children might need only one-tenth of the active ingredient."

889,"Especially with people who die suddenly, like young mothers with children and young people with living siblings, if an autopsy finds that Sarah didn't die of COVID, she died of something else, for example a congenital heart defect... the surviving family will now know to go to a doctor and be screened for the same defect to prevent another premature death in that family."
890,"Classic example: The families of basketball and volleyball players who are unusually tall experience a relatively high number of sudden deaths, and autopsies regularly reveal to their surviving family undiagnosed illnesses such as Marfan's syndrome (a side effect is being really tall with long limbs and very weak hearts) and other forms of hereditary heart diseases that disproportionately affect tall people."

927,*
928,Perhaps.
929,But I do want to see more data on current variant because it does seem super aggressive.
930,Most indians got through first wave just fine and india stopped social distancing a long time ago so I think new variants are to blame here.
931,Astra Zeneca is not a non profit organisation.
932,They are a profitable pharma company.
933,In 2019 according to their financial report they had a core operating profit of $6.4bn.
934,They made a deal with Oxford University which allowed them free access to a potentially very profitable product.
935,The only price they pay is having to sell it on a at cost basis for a certain time period and long term to certain costumers.
936,At cost by the way still includes the cost of scaling up the production.
937,At the end of the at cost time period they still have a product which by the looks of it might be needed long term and becomes one of the usual vaccinations everybody gets.
938,And they will already have running and payed for production lines for that product.
939,[removed]
940,My Mrs had no side effects from the second Pfizer.
941,I‚ÄôM ALRIGHT!
942,You can still spread the virus while vaccinated.
943,A lot less (hopefully) but can still happen.
944,So you can still spread it to unvaccinated?
945,[removed]
946,I saw a list a year ago of candidate vaccines being worked on.
947,71 separate vaccines.
948,"Totally agree, I've seen this ""the same thing happened last spring"" post several times recently and I think that's super wrong."
949,"I'm not saying seasonality isn't a factor here (there's always lots of factors at play), but this situation is COMPLETELY different from last spring for obvious reasons as you touched on."
950,"But I think even more importantly than that, is the fact that the comparison to ""last spring"" actually makes the opposite argument in the first place."
951,We had a SHIT ton of coronavirus at this time last year - the official case count obviously does not do it justice.
952,"On this day 1 year ago, over TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED people died of coronavirus."
953,"We had definitely begun to slope downward, but it was still a total disaster because we'd just peaked a couple weeks prior."
954,The current situation is nothing like that.
955,"We peaked months ago, and spread was totally under control (generally speaking) throughout the entire period of time where we were surging last year."
956,AND this is with easing restrictions all across the country (and little/no restrictions in some places).
957,"AND last year, that clusterfuck was mostly still confined to the northeast because the virus was still in the seeding phase in the rest of the country."
958,"So like... with EXTREMELY lighter restrictions, as well as deeply rooted spread already in place across the entire country, we've had a mere fraction of the coronavirus that we had last year in like one fourth of the country all throughout March and April."
959,I don't think it's even remotely similar.
960,Did seasonality help turn around places like Michigan and New Jersey this past week or two?
961,I'm sure it did something.
962,But it's nothing like last year.
963,Japan got 39 million doses from Europe.
964,What is taking them so long to get it into their people‚Äôs arms ?
965,[removed]
966,Thanks Edi for the correction
967,It‚Äôs actually increasing in much of the world.
968,In the US it‚Äôs not over because we still have high case numbers and high numbers of people who won‚Äôt take the vaccine.
969,It's surprisingly difficult to walk outside by myself.
970,"I went for a hike last May but the trail was full of people, there was no way to step more than about two feet away when passing, and I got a bunch of sour looks because I didn't have a mask."
971,So I always brought one with me after that.
972,"If I can see there's nobody around, I take it off, and it's trivial to put it back on when I'm going to approach anyone within 10 feet."
973,And there's no reason not to.
974,"The mask habit near my suburban home only makes sense, there are people out walking their dogs all the time."
975,Passing people on the sidewalk is unavoidable.
976,Breh we didn't ban India until yesterday and Amsterdam still has Brazilians arriving every day.
977,[removed]
978,but the worst may not be the same in every country.
979,Australia lost control for a while but only 910 deaths in total.
980,It doesn't make sense.
981,Wearing mask while jogging is absolute nonsense.
982,Wearing a mask generally isn't doinga anything at all.
983,The chances of getting sick with Covid outside are so incredibly small.
984,We knew this since the beginning in early 2020.
985,Covid spreads best in bad ventilated buildings with many people inside them.
986,god anti vaxxers are fucking morons
987,I see what you mean but unfortunately it's not that simple; someone could have gotten it and unknowingly passed it along.
988,Think of a restaurant with 50 customers a few months ago; all 50 would be subject to contact tracing and thus leaves 50 unique paths to one infected person.
989,"It's like finding a penny in a haystack at that point, and could lead to a lot of wrongful accusations."
990,"I think if our current system just doubled down on these knobs who throw the parties and participate, things should get better without risking innocent people's freedom."
991,Not yet
992,Has anyone had their second dose side-effects last longer than 2 days?
993,Still waiting for mine to kick in (if they do) after I received my second Pfizer dose 15 hours ago.
994,I've just had a sore arm so far.
995,I mean they could have reduced hospitalization by 50% and would have been considered working.
996,One of the worst was when the CDC intentionally lied to us that masks don't work.
997,"After the terrible messaging over the past year compounded by the gaslighting and mocking of those who care enough to take precautions, I would rather be at least a *little* more cautious than what the CDC recommends."
998,"2006, my account is roughly 2.5 years old."
999,"Yeah exactly ""good immune system=more side effects""."
1000,I'm in my early 30s and only had the sore arm
1001,The next problem will be defining what is ‚Äúunder control‚Äù.
1002,We need to set a date all restrictions are lifted in the US we can‚Äôt hold people down and make them take the shot so anyone who wants it will have it in the next 60 days.
1003,I‚Äôm 36 and get my second shot tomorrow.
1004,Two weeks later I won‚Äôt be out licking door knobs but I will only be masking up when private businesses request it and I fully intend on packed football stadiums in the fall.
1005,Lots of overlap in vax and nat.
1006,[removed]
1007,It means nothing period.
1008,It's way too small a sample size to draw any meaningful conclusions either way.
1009,I think most people understand this.
1010,I doubt that anyone believes a store clerk in  Barabinsk is actively trying to manipulate westerners using fake social media accounts.

1034,That doesn't mean we can't call out the insanity from China and Russia though.
1035,"In fact, we should."
1036,Part of the failings of the west is because we were too soft on Russia and China.
1037,Actually all studies show that covid recovered people need only shot to be even better protected than pop who didn‚Äôt have it after two shots.
1038,So that Second own is entirely unnecessary and has just shown the lead to more side effects and hyper immune reactions.
1039,My country France gives you only one hair if you‚Äôve had covid.

1056,"Real shame but after living 45 years in Detroit area, hardly suprising."
1057,[removed]
1058,Basically yeah.
1059,"The herd immunity threshold doesn't mean cases stop immediately, just that the epidemic cannot grow any more, so there will be some overshoot, and the epidemic might go down frustratingly slowly (but consistently)."
1060,"&gt;In Germany the health insurance also doesn‚Äôt cover birth control, glasses, or dental procedures involving more than a rock and a screwdriver."
1061,That's mostly false.
1062,"Root canals are covered 30 to 50% of the cost by health insurances, fillings, periodic clean and check ups are fully covered."
1063,"Glasses are covered if you go past the point of it being a nuisance, e.g."
1064,at least 50% of visual impairment if I remember correctly - for lesser sight losses any Fielmann will have you covered for a relatively cheap sum.
1065,"Birth control specifically are not covered, although a wide range of women healthcare necessities is."
1066,&gt;Personally I spent less money on healthcare in the US because the German health insurance really only kicks in if you‚Äôre dying.
1067,Yeah that's a vast exaggeration.
1068,"I get checkups with specialists relatively regularly + I am on regular prescriptions for non life threatening issues and I never paid a sum high enough to be noticeable, usually single digit."
1069,&gt;In the US my insurance actually paid for the small stuff that I needed where as in Germany they‚Äôre just like ‚ÄúRoot canal?
1070,"Best I can do is dentures.‚Äù

Again, that's false."
1071,[Here](https://www.newmouth.com/blog/root-canal-without-insurance/) you can see that insurances actually make quite a dent in the final cost.
1072,"That's only considering the public basic insurance, paying for additional care is possible and translates in a better cost all around."
1073,"&gt;A lot of insurances choose to cover the flu shot for everyone but not all of them do, so a lot of people think that they‚Äôll have to pay out of pocket even though they might not have to."
1074,Combined with the fact that it ends up being a 2+ hour ordeal at a doctors office most people just don‚Äôt bother.
1075,"A vast majority of insurance companies do cover the cost, and coverage for risk groups is mandatory."
1076,"The insurance companies cited [here](https://www.rtl.de/cms/wer-zahlt-die-grippeimpfung-diese-krankenkassen-uebernehmen-die-kosten-4624122.html) cover the flu shot even for non-risk groups, some (other) insurance companies offer a vaccination yearly budget in which you fit the flu shot as well."
1077,All and all I wouldn't say that it is a problem of availability.
1078,I think this says more about how bad public discourse has become where everything is black and white rather than having nuance.
1079,"To be honest, I was hesitant to get the vaccine at first and it was annoying to get lumped in with the crazy anti-vaxxers who think any and every vaccine is bad."
1080,It‚Äôs possible.
1081,Having said that important context is that this is an environment where there is no possibility of having to go into a store or any other location or where‚Äôd you have to interact with any more than one or two people passing you on a side walk.
1082,There was a big study on half a million people in the im showing that people after one dose of the vaccine and recovered individuals had the exact same percentage of getting covid.
1083,So it‚Äôs not true that the infection doesn‚Äôt give immunity.
1084,It‚Äôs just not perfect but neither is the vaccine.
1085,"The whole point of getting the vaccine is so I can return to normalcy (travel, visit family, gym-things I haven‚Äôt done in over a year while patiently waiting for the vaccine)."
1086,Otherwise what is the point of getting it?
1087,These two countriea are the gift that keeps on giving.

1149,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The Health Ministry has identified 41 new cases of the Indian coronavirus variant in Israel, including four in people who have been vaccinated against COVID-19."
1150,"&gt;  
&gt;Israel's genomic sequencing system found that 24 of those infected with the variant, which experts say may be more contagious than other variants, had returned recently from abroad."
1151,"The other 17 contracted it via community transmission, including five schoolchildren."
1152,The Health Ministry and the IDF Home Front Command are carrying out widespread testing at the schools where the children are enrolled.
1153,"&gt;  
&gt;Twenty-one of the people who tested positive for the variant are foreign nationals."
1154,"Last week, Israel banned entry to tourists from India over concerns about the variant's spread and the severe increase in cases there."
1155,"As part of the new restrictions, only 300 Indian caregivers and students will be allowed to enter the country per month."
1156,"They will be required to quarantine at coronavirus hotels designated for those coming from India, unless they have either recovered from or were vaccinated against COVID-19 in Israel."
1157,"&gt;  
&gt;A Health Ministry statement said that new restrictions which would forbid Israelis from traveling to countries with high infection rates (save for exceptional cases) are awaiting approval from the relevant ministries before it can be sent to government approval."
1158,"Israelis returning from these countries would also need to quarantine, even if they have been vaccinated against or recovered from COVID-19."
1159,"Foreign nationals from these countries would also not be allowed to enter Israel, and those who have received permission to do so would have to quarantine at designated hotels, as is the case with arrivals from India."
1160,"&gt;  
&gt;Last month some 1,000 people entered Israel from India, and only about a quarter of them were vaccinated."
1161,"Among those who entered, 63 tested positive for the virus, but not all of them had necessarily been infected by the Indian variant."
1162,"&gt;  
&gt;The Indian variant is of concern to experts because it consist of two mutations of its protein, which could make it more resistant to the coronavirus vaccine."
1163,"Last month, the Indian Health Ministry reported on a strain of the virus that includes two genetic changes and constitutes a kind of ‚Äúunion‚Äù of two variants previously known as E484Q and L452R."
1164,"&gt;  
&gt;However, because samples collected from throughout India have shown that the most dominant variant in the country is the British variant, the prevailing view is that the new strain of the virus is not behind the latest outbreak in India, which is rapidly spreading across the country."
1165,"&gt;  
&gt;The Israeli Health Ministry also identified eight new cases of the South African variant, seven of the New York variant, two of the California variant, one of the St. Petersburg variant and one case of an additional British variant."
1166,"&gt;  
&gt;Although most of the coronavirus restrictions in Israel have been rolled back in recent weeks due to the drop in infections, entrance to the country is still being controlled."
1167,"Israelis who enter without a vaccination certificate must quarantine at home, while those who recovered or were vaccinated in Israel do not have to quarantine, but must receive a negative result from the rapid coronavirus test now being administered to everyone entering Israel via Ben-Gurion Airport."

1230,You're saying it's unreasonable to direct the anger at not having vaccines at the organization that hasn't delivered said vaccines?
1231,Apologies.

1245,America has a population that fits in the rounding error of how many people we're not sure live in China.
1246,And yet America still thinks they are the world.
1247,More scientists serving in legislatures?
1248,YES PLEASE.
1249,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*The pandemic has given scientists a more prominent voice in society."
1250,They need to use it to push for better health through equality.
1251,"*  
&gt;  
&gt;For more than 150 years, scholarship and research have revealed how poor and marginalized communities are disproportionately affected by disease."
1252,"People are more likely to become unwell if they earn low wages, have few employment protections, live in unsafe environments, receive poor-quality education, or are discriminated against."
1253,"Whether Prussia‚Äôs typhus epidemic of 1847‚Äì48, tuberculosis outbreaks in the United States in the 1930s or chronic diseases today, researchers conclude that people would live longer, healthier lives if a society‚Äôs collective wealth could be shared more equally."
1254,"&gt;  
&gt;Scholars in disciplines ranging from economics to epidemiology and sociology have proposed ideas for how to share the world‚Äôs wealth."
1255,But their advice has mostly been disregarded by politicians.
1256,This is in part because the idea that the public and private sectors need to have a greater role in reducing inequality has been at odds with the thrust of global politics for at least four decades.
1257,"&gt;  
&gt;**During the COVID-19 pandemic, the successes that scientists have scored with drugs, vaccines and other interventions have given researchers a voice in decision-making."
1258,"They need to use that position to advocate policies that would improve social determinants of better health, such as living wages, employment protections and high-quality educational opportunities."
1259,"In this way, scientists need to ‚Äòget political‚Äô."
1260,"**  
&gt;  
&gt;That will require, among other things, scientists to consider how they can best achieve political impact and policy engagement."
1261,But advice is on hand.
1262,"A [News Feature this week](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00943-x) describes how community organizations in one of the poorest regions of the United States, California‚Äôs San Joaquin Valley, tried to curb COVID-19 in communities of colour by tackling some of the disease‚Äôs underlying determinants, in part through political engagement."
1263,"&gt;  
&gt;Hundreds of thousands of people in the valley ‚Äî mainly immigrants ‚Äî work on farms and in food-processing or meat-packing plants."
1264,"Compared with California‚Äôs more affluent regions, wages in the valley are low and labour protections weak."
1265,"And neighbourhoods of agricultural workers often have poor-quality schools, insufficient clinics and few markets selling healthy food."
1266,"Some areas even lack clean, running water."
1267,"A child born in San Francisco, California, is expected to live for at least ten years longer than children born in many parts of the valley."
1268,"&gt;  
&gt;**State and county public-health officials know this, but are often unable to push local leaders for the necessary policy changes."
1269,"This is because they are generally hired to carry out the wishes of elected politicians, and their budgets and jurisdictions are therefore determined by those politicians."
1270,"**  
&gt;  
&gt;**But academic scientists are not tied by these constraints."
1271,"** During the pandemic, researchers in the San Joaquin Valley have partnered with grass-roots groups to try to address inequities and push agriculture companies to report COVID-19 outbreaks and protect their employees with face masks and physical distancing."
1272,"They have also distributed free tests, and provided outreach and financial assistance for under-served communities."
1273,"&gt;  
&gt;*Funding gaps*  
&gt;  
&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare society‚Äôs inequities more starkly than most people today will have witnessed."
1274,"In the United States, Black, Hispanic and Latinx people are about three times as likely as white Americans to be hospitalized with COVID-19."
1275,"In the United Kingdom, Bangladeshi-Britons have [twice the risk of death from COVID-19](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/908434/Disparities_in_the_risk_and_outcomes_of_COVID_August_2020_update.pdf) as white British people."
1276,"In Singapore, most COVID-19 cases have occurred in migrant workers, including those from Malaysia, Bangladesh and India."
1277,"&gt;  
&gt;And the gap between rich and poor is rising in much of the world."
1278,"In the United States alone, billionaires have increased their wealth by 44% ‚Äî to a total of US$4.3 trillion ‚Äî in the past year, and 1.5 million jobs were created in the top wage bracket."
1279,"And yet, 7.9 million low-wage workers lost their jobs."
1280,The number of families reporting hunger and homelessness climbed in 2020.
1281,"&gt;  
&gt;In the United States and Europe, funders have responded with grants to explore and address health disparities and their social determinants."
1282,"**Researchers should push themselves to go further than simply collecting data on the social and economic roots of poor health, and perhaps even deeper than devising interventions to address immediate needs, such as programmes to teach communities about nutrition."
1283,"**  
&gt;  
&gt;*Getting involved*  
&gt;  
&gt;But there are few long-term funding opportunities for such work, or even for researchers whose main objective is evidence-based policy ‚Äî let alone systemic reform ‚Äî and that, too, needs to change."
1284,**Funders and research leaders must place a higher value on these types of impact in research-evaluation criteria.
1285,Then scientists would have a greater incentive to collaborate with economists and political scientists to devise ways to share wealth and turn around rising inequality.
1286,"** Those who study racism could work with epidemiologists to better understand why economic and political systems have marginalized certain groups of people for decades, and how reparations or other reforms could begin to turn the tide."
1287,"&gt;  
&gt;Researchers can also work with think tanks to write the short, research-informed reports that are required reading for politicians and policymakers, but are not part of conventional journal publishing."
1288,And they could co-design their studies with grass-roots groups who advocate for ‚Äî and work with ‚Äî communities in need.
1289,"**Scientists should also consider standing for elected bodies such as local, regional or national legislatures ‚Äî which often have a dearth of representatives with research expertise."
1290,"**  
&gt;  
&gt;Scientific discoveries and inventions made during the pandemic have led to progress in diagnostics, therapies and, of course, vaccine production."
1291,"But the pandemic is far from over, and, combined with economic inequality and climate change, the world is in a precarious era."
1292,"**Now that the pandemic has elevated scientists‚Äô voice in society, more must learn how best to use that voice to advance the cause of economic, racial and social justice."
1293,"Without such change, the essential research that is scientists‚Äô main focus will ultimately fall short of achieving its goal of building healthier, more resilient, more equal and more just societies."
1294,**
1295,I saw some sentiment online that young healthy people should have side effects from the vaccine besides a sore arm and if you only had a sore arm there may be something wrong with you.

1305,"Your math is off: When you divide the 90m number by 2, you are assuming there is a consistent number of people becoming fully vaccinated every day from December 13 to April 20."
1306,"Instead, you need to look at the population that is fully vaccinated (what the CDC uses to determine vaccine efficacy here*) in order to come up with an average."
1307,"It looks like the average fully vaccinated in that period is 26,776,416 (taking data from the table you can download [here](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccination-trends), expand ""Data Table for Trends in Number of COVID-19 Vaccinations in the US"" under the chart, download table, and averaging the  cumulative fully vaccinated by day)."
1308,It's also not fully reliable as someone who was vaccinated on April 20 obviously isn't testing positive and dying and having that death reported all in the same day.
1309,"If you look at fully vaxxed numbers just up to the end of March (giving a 3 week lead time for COVID--&gt;Death--&gt;Report), the average is 17,652,837."
1310,"Your numbers will still look very good, just not as great as they appear now, but it's one less hole for an anti-vaxxer to poke in it."
1311,"*Based on your CDC sources I glanced at, they appear to be counting those who are fully vaxxed and tested positive anytime after the final dose, rather than the '2 weeks after final dose' metric that they typically use."

Taiwan has bought 150 oxygen concentrators and aims to send them to India this weekend to help it deal with a massive increase in COVID-19 infections, and is also looking at providing further aid, Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said on Thursday."
1356,Countries around the world have been rushing to help India alleviate the crisis.
1357,"India's death toll from the coronavirus pandemic surged past 200,000 on Wednesday, worsened by shortages of hospital beds and medical oxygen."
1358,Wu told reporters that they had been working on an aid package for India and have already purchased 150 oxygen concentrators which should be able to be sent this weekend.
1359,"""We are in the process of buying more oxygen concentrators and buying raw materials from overseas so our companies at home can produce even more,"" he said."

1361,"Taiwan is also looking at providing other aid as requested by India, Wu added."
1362,"While India, like most countries, has no formal diplomatic ties with Chinese-claimed Taiwan, the two have gotten closer in recent years thanks to their shared antipathy of Beijing."

1462,"We don't know how many infections there would be among a unmasked, unrestricted, non-vaccinated population, as even the states with little restrictions still have reasonably high mask use levels."
1463,"So the CDC is saying that for now, even 90-95% fewer cases than in a hypothetical completely unrestricted, unmasked, non-vaccinated population would be too much."
1464,"Of course, as the share of vaccinated goes up, the amount of virus in circulation among the non-vaccinated goes down too, so this will change."
1465,"But you cannot look at being vaccinated in isolation, you also need to look at the situation at large."
1466,"If effectiveness was 100%, you wouldn't need to, but it's not."
1467,"It's not just that, it also makes it easier to control mask mandates if they apply to everyone, but this is a big part of the CDC risk calculation."

1484,"Maybe it's just me, but I see the same people who are hesitant about the vaccines as the same group that has been not following restrictions this whole time."
1485,"For instance, Washington and Oregon had very low cases per person and even with their vaccination rate they are the ones with cases going up."

1542,&gt; Another unknown is whether the manufacturing problem that led to the adenovirus vector being able to replicate also knocks out the DNA code for the spike protein -- rendering the shot ineffective as a coronavirus vaccine.

2343,"India was placed on England‚Äôs travel ‚Äúred list‚Äù from 23 April, restricting arrivals to citizens and residents who must quarantine in a hotel."

2345,"It should have been obvious, from the start, that people would need to provide proof of vaccination--to other nations (and airlines) to travel internationally, to employers, to schools, etc."
2346,They should have been setting up that system while the vaccines were being developed and tested.
2347,I think it's more of a wave...think of it like hot air and cold air.
2348,"What happens in cool weather, when you open the door to your toasty house?"
2349,"Hot air rushes out, and cool air sneaks in."
2350,"These ""waves"" of variants happen because one variant takes the place of the other."
2351,The key is not to be complacent.
2352,Do not open up to quickly.
2353,Manage outbreaks.
2354,Quarantine positive cases quickly.
2355,"Vaccinate, and test, test, test."

2357,How would you go about getting a flu test until recently?
2358,"Where I live, if you had any flu like symptoms you were told to get a covid test."
2359,No doctor would physically see you to give you a flu test until you had a negative covid result.
2360,"Results would take up to 5 days to get back and by then, if you had the flu, symptoms would be clearing up."
2361,"The wave of cases and illnesses currently happening is among the middle class, people in the cities and suburbs that own their houses, etc."
2362,The first wave earlier was among the impoverished and somehow was either not that bad or was not fully quantified or reported.
2363,"By the time the US can mobilize a vaccine shipment, send it there, have india distribute then administer the shots...the current wave there will be over anyway."

2370,YES!!!
2371,!
2372,I think it is a major deterrent for those who did abuse it for sure.
2373,"However assuming  countries that have a 14 days quarantine requirement, as far as the US is concerned the average American probably has ran out of PTO with one quarantine requirement (at least returning to the US doesn't involve quarantine) unless they have a secure job that can be done remotely during the quarantine period or professions that have large chunk of time off like teachers/professors or self employed."
2374,So it potentially even prevents those who wouldn't abuse the system to do it even once.
2375,"I am glad that neither the US or France requires quarantine, just testing and has a fully vaccinated person going into my fully vaccinated family, testing is already an additional step I am okay to take despite being highly low risk of contributing to virus spread."
2376,We need to push the message that vaccines will lower restrictions on those who get it to increase vaccination rates.
2377,The restrictions should be for those who refuse to do their part of ending the pandemic by refusing vaccines (excluding those who have a valid medical exemption verified by a doctor)
2378,moderna?
2379,So is there no reason to worry about the India variant?
2380,The situation sounds really scary but I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs bc the variant is more dangerous or if it is bc of living conditions in India.
2381,I try to stay up to date on this stuff but took a break from Covid articles as my mental health was plummeting.
2382,"It's been proven to increase over time (about 8 weeks is when their data effectively ends), and at that time it had increased to \~90%."

2391,No it hasn't.
2392,It's called parosmia.
2393,It implies that some of your olfactory neurons got destroyed and were replaced.
2394,"Most neurons can't regenerate, but these can."
2395,When it regenerates the neuron sends its' axon towards the primary olfactory cortex for interpretation.
2396,"However the axon isn't necessarily sent at the same place as before, and the interpretation may be off."
2397,Doctors are apparently having good success telling patients to make an effort to smell different foods every day.
2398,"The idea is that brain should eventually adjust its' interpretation of the smell to something more appropriate, by changing its' wiring through new dendrites and synapses."

2414,I'm talking about the basic research behind mRNA tech used in both.
2415,I'm aware Pfizer took no funding from the US.
2416,AZ now is not even trying...
2417,So you took it literally as there were no cases during the entire flu season?
2418,I mean if that's where you started out then you were already wrong to begin with.
2419,"Of course there are gonna be cases, just like there are still cases of the bubonic plague and anthrax infection."
2420,I mean the short answer is that all 3 things are simply untrue.
2421,They are just lies.
2422,I saw in another thread that early in the pandemic there was a rumor going around that hospitals were stealing the synovial knee fluid from people and selling it on the black market and that covid was a hoax that was a way to get people into the hospital.
2423,I mean I don't know where this shit comes from or why people believe it.

2435,Except in large crowds
2436,The least safe items should be at least yellow not green for fully vaccinated people.
2437,I'm certainly not going to do those things for awhile.
2438,In those situations you're going to be around unmasked or at best diaper chinned or below the nose masked people.
2439,"Also, the insuation here is that cloth masks protect yourself which it doesn't do well."
2440,You can't assume that offering cash to people will make them more willing to take the vaccine.
2441,From behavioral economics/psychology you should rather expect the opposite to happen.
2442,"If someone already have an intrinsic motivation for doing something, and you offer them money to do it, the economic motivation will often replace their previous motivation, instead of adding to it."
2443,"The result can be that they do less of the thing you want, instead of more."
2444,"In addition, a vaccine is ostensibly something good, that people would be willing to pay to get."
2445,"But if you offer them money to get it, that changes the category of the vaccine to one of those things that they normally don't want but other people pay them to do."
2446,"That can confuse a lot of people, and would also make many people very suspicious."
2447,"""Why do you want to pay me to take a vaccine?"
2448,What is wrong with it?
2449,"What are you hiding from me?"""
2450,There's some things you can do that don't suffer from effects like these.
2451,Making things free seem to only have positive effects.
2452,"So making the vaccine free, the administration of the vaccine free, giving people paid leave from work to take the vaccine, free Uber rides to and from vaccination and so on should all work the way you want and increase vaccinations."
2453,But you should be wary of moving past free.
2454,Why drive in?
2455,No because they test for covid.
2456,"Flu will never test positive for covid, PCR doesn't work like that."
2457,Sorry to hear that you are going though all of that.
2458,*-it change your DNA!
2459,"NOOOOO* 

\- A mRNA vaccine is incapable of changing your DNA."
2460,That is impossible for three reasons.
2461,1.
2462,DNA in a cell is housed in the nucleus.
2463,In order to access the nucleus the vaccine would need to pass though the nuclear membrane.
2464,"To do that, the vaccine would need a nuclear access signal (which it doesn't have)."
2465,No signal means that it is biologically impossible for the vaccine to enter your nucleus and interact with your DNA.
2466,2.
2467,DNA and RNA are separate languages.
2468,Let's suppose that the vaccine somehow did the biologically impossible and managed to sneak though a nuclear membrane.
2469,In that situation the RNA from the vaccine would be incapable of communicating with the DNA of your cell.
2470,RNA and DNA are completely different languages.
2471,"For DNA and RNA to communicate with each other a ""translator"" reverse transcription enzyme would need to be used."
2472,The vaccine does not have this enzyme in it and therefore it is impossible for vaccine RNA to communicate with cellular DNA.
2473,3.
2474,RNA cannot integrate with DNA without integrase.
2475,"If biological impossibility 1 and 2 happened, the vaccine RNA would still be incapable of integrating with your DNA."
2476,"For this to happen, yet another enzyme would need to be present in the vaccine."
2477,Which it is not.
2478,"So in short, it is literally impossible for the vaccine to interact with your DNA."
2479,"*-If you get the COVID vaccine, you have to quarantine for 2 weeks because of shedding."
2480,"* 

A mRNA vaccine does not actually have any COVID virus in it."
2481,Therefore it is impossible for you to shed the virus.
2482,*-TONS OF PEOPLE ARE DYING FROM THE VACCINE!!
2483,How many people have died from the vaccine.
2484,"*

 I see this one a lot."
2485,The misconception here stems from a misunderstanding of correlation and causation.
2486,Have people died who have *taken* the vaccine?
2487,"Yes, thousands of people have died after taking the vaccine."
2488,Thousands of people die every day.
2489,But has the *vaccine* been responsible for those deaths?
2490,No.
2491,"Right now it looks like of the 1.1 *billion* people vaccinated so far, one person had a freak blood clot which unfortunately led to their death."
2492,You would be more likely to win the Powerball lottery four times than to die of a vaccine related blood clot.
2493,You're right.
2494,And the article states there were still cases/deaths of the flu during the 2020/2021 season.
2495,It also shows a graphic about flu testing dropping to near 0.
2496,"I got both Pfizer shots and never felt a thing either time, did not even feel the shot, no side effects at all."
2497,Cold
2498,Another political nail in Putin's reputation and legacy as a corrupt leader.

2506,"For context, it was 3 million last Thursday, 3.5 million the Thursday before that, and 3.4 million the Thursday before that."
2507,We haven't had a Thursday this low in a month and a half.
2508,"So yeah, 2.7 million is nothing to sneeze at, but the direction we're headed in isn't great."
2509,Alabama checking in.
2510,"Not defending our lower than average number, but to maybe help explain some of it, we ‚Äúopened‚Äù up pretty early and took our large case load also early in the Summer/Fall as our reward."
2511,"At this point, life is pretty much back to normal minus most wearing masks indoors (which isn‚Äôt going to change for another few months regardless)."
2512,Our cases are really pretty low (200-300 per Day or so for the entire state).
2513,Our schools are wrapping up a successful in-person school year.
2514,Most of the at risk and older age population (my parents and my in-laws included) have been vaccinated.
2515,The weather is nice and we‚Äôre all ready for summer to begin.
2516,"So, to many, it just may not feel like there is a huge sense of urgency to get vaccinated if you aren‚Äôt in the older age or higher risk categories whom are mostly all now protected."
2517,"I believe it would have been different this time last year when our cases were way up and thing were ‚Äúscary‚Äù, if vaccines had been available then though."
2518,"Anyway, the number looks pretty bad on a map, but daily life here is really pretty good and only getting better."
2519,"Some people don't make the correct type or level of immune response even with the shot, in addition to that there are MULTIPLE different forms of flu circulating every single flu season."
2520,Scientists look at all the strains and quickly have to literally predict the future as to which strain will be the most problematic in order to get vaccines out to the general public in time.
2521,So if you're getting the shot and still getting the flu either 1) your immune system sucks horribly or 2) you've been one of the unlucky ones to get the strain that no one expected to be an issue.
2522,"Trust me I've also gotten the shot and gotten the flu the same year, just happens."

2536,Scotty!
2537,You just earned your pay for the week!
2538,Testing and quarantine seems like such a small cost to me.
2539,"There will be a few people who are very much inconvenienced by the quarantine period, but ideally you are also making sure people don‚Äôt abuse it."
2540,The government can‚Äôt just trust people to act responsibly because people aren‚Äôt responsible and even if you want to be this virus makes it so that you may not be.
2541,"The people who are responsible can do their best to factor those quarantine days into their travels, I think it‚Äôs fair to say that‚Äôs part of being responsible."
2542,"That really seems like a fair solution, people can still come in and we are not taking as much risk for spreading the virus further."
2543,Quantity of dosage does matter.
2544,"When I got the J&amp;J vaccine, they put a little round sticker with a plastic center on my skin, the purpose of which was to prevent spillage from the injection site."

2727,Might be a legit complaint.
2728,Here is the post again with the source they didn't like removed.
2729,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I mean you could literally just Google it or do a tiny bit of your own research."
2730,"But ok, I'll do it for you."
2731,"&gt;  
&gt;In an open letter  to the German government and state premiers, five leading members of  the Association for Aerosol Research (GAeF) write that ""The transmission  of SARS-CoV-2 viruses takes place indoors almost without exception."
2732,"Transmission outdoors is extremely rare and never leads to cluster  infections as can be observed indoors."""
2733,"&gt;  
&gt;https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-the-risk-of-catching-coronavirus-outdoors/a-56792936  
&gt;  
&gt;Our study does not rule out outdoor transmission of the virus."
2734,"However, among our 7,324 identified cases in China with sufficient descriptions, only one outdoor outbreak involving two cases occurred in a village in Shangqiu, Henan."
2735,A 27-year-old man had a conversation outdoors with an individual who had returned from Wuhan on 25 January and had the onset of symptoms on 1 February.
2736,"&gt;  
&gt;https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.04.20053058v1.full.pdf  
&gt;  
&gt;The one outdoor outbreak also involved a face to face conversation, meaning closer proximity and more time, both factors that help facilitate the spread of Corona."
2737,"&gt;  
&gt;Evidence continues to suggest that the vast majority oftransmission happens in indoor spaces; recent reviewsconsidering data from several countriesfound very little evidence of outdoor transmission for SARS-CoV-2, influenza or other respiratory viruses \[9, 10\]."
2738,"The small number of cases where outdoor transmission may have occurred are associated with gatherings that facilitate close interactions, particularly extended duration, or settings where people mixed in indoor venues alongside an outdoor setting."
2739,It is therefore important that messaging recognises that close interactions outdoors can still pose a risk.
2740,"&gt;  
&gt;https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment\_data/file/945978/S0921\_Factors\_contributing\_to\_risk\_of\_SARS\_18122020.pdf  
&gt;  
&gt;Of the 20,471 cases in the LSHTM database, only 461 in 11 clusters were associated solely with outdoor environments."
2741,"&gt;  
&gt;https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.04.20188417v2.full-text  
&gt;  
&gt;It's important to note that each of these studies only looks at Outdoors vs Indoors."
2742,"In fact, they even go so far as to mention that people WERE NOT socially distancing."
2743,So in non socially distanced outdoors activities these studies are already showing that very few cases were transmitted outdoors (.03% and 2.2%).
2744,Adding in social distancing would reduce those numbers significantly further.

2764,"An adenovirus infection is rarely dangerous, but this is a sign of a colossal quality control failure in the manufacturing of the vaccine."
2765,It's just sloppy beyond belief.
2766,Sputnik is pretty much guaranteed not to be approved by Western regulators at this point.
2767,I think they made the wrong calculation with the noble lie.
2768,"Just like it was a noble lie to tell us masks didn‚Äôt work in the beginning in order to preserve them for medical staff, they‚Äôre using another noble lie because they fear that if they truthfully tell vaccinated people that they can generally return to normal without masks and social distancing, because they‚Äôre afraid that the unvaccinated will follow suit, they don‚Äôt."
2769,"People can see all the studies that come out saving post vaccination, the average non immunodeficient person is essentially impervious to COVID, and as a result of that you just broadly lose trust with people who won‚Äôt stop lying to you, noble or not."

2783,"The title is, ""Effectiveness of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Vaccines Against COVID-19 Among **Hospitalized** Adults Aged ‚â•65 Years."""
2784,So the Axios headline is wrong.
2785,Nobody pays any attention to Macron anyway.
2786,Ironic.
2787,"Tennessee's COVID death rate is 7 people per 100,000 over the national average."

2790,"There have been millions of people across the US who gave up a normal life for the public good but in Tennessee, given their population, only 487 people above average had to do so for nearly 7 million to benefit."

2841,I will be.
2842,But vaccines aren't 100% and I have a weird risk profile (just getting a viral infection is bad for my chronic condition - the last time I got the flu made me sick for about a year).
2843,"Until I can be reasonably confident that the people around me are also vaccinated or will be distanced and masked, I'm not going to be comfortable doing it."

2845,It seems highly unlikely.
2846,"A robust vaccinated immune system, should kill the virus at a rapid pace."
2847,The viral load needed to be infected by coronavirus is over 1000 virions.
2848,"Seems pretty unlikely that you can get corona, it can replicate enough before being killed and then having a large enough load to infect other people."
2849,But then they have a panoply of recommendations for vaccinated people.
2850,The CDC has been about what you‚Äôd expect for a country that the WHO ranked as [the 37th best health care system in the world](https://www.who.int/news/item/07-02-2000-world-health-organization-assesses-the-world's-health-systems).
2851,"They fucked up the early testing program, fucked up their early recommendations and are fucking up now with their J&amp;J advice."

2862,"According to her, masks should be worn all the time irrespective of your vaccination status, the vaccine is not a cure/solution to the pandemic and that we are supposed to live like this for several years (I'd imagine she wanted to say forever, but didn't)."
2863,"It's disturbing, to say the least."
2864,In my state they need to bring their parent/guardian along to get vaccinated (written consent isn't enough) which adds an extra logistical layer.

2912,"Even if it mutates, it's not clear that the mutation will get past the vaccine - not just on a general cross-immunity type basis, but in the entire way the vaccine works."
2913,The vaccine targets the spike protein that attaches the virus to the cell.
2914,"In order to evade the vaccine, the virus needs to develop a new spike protein that is different enough from the existing spike protein to evade the vaccine-triggered defenses, but similar enough that it doesn't stop working entirely."
2915,Is Norway part of the EU vaccination program?
2916,That is categorically false.
2917,We need asymptomatic testing of vaccinated and unvaccinated people to understand the breakthrough infection risk.
2918,We need asymptomatic unvaccinated people testing to understand what the risk of infection is for an unvaccinated person as well.
2919,The risk of long Covid from asymptomatic cases (at initial positive test) makes the risk of catching Covid something we need to understand.

2998,A very tiny number of people (less than .001 percent) having severe adverse reactions?

3030,Use reasoning skills instead of listening to a liberal study from a liberal university from a liberal state that polled 800 people.
3031,But there has *barely* been enough time since they opened vaccines up to everyone for someone to get fully vaccinated (plus the waiting period after).

3091,Here we go with reasoning skills...
3092,"So, Trump won the 65+ crowd by about 3 points, 51% to 48%."
3093,"The 65+ age group, per the CDC, is about 82% with at least one vaccine dose."
3094,Let's assume that 95% of Biden voters over 65 got at least one dose (per the poll) - that's 45.6% of the over 65 crowd.
3095,"So, 82 (the percent with one dose) minus 45.6 (Biden voters with one dose) leave us needing another 36.4%, which had to come from Trump voters."
3096,"So if Trump won 51% of that age group, that means we have a remainder of 14.6%."
3097,That 14.6 represents 28.6% of Trump voters over 65.
3098,"As you said, the older folks got vaccinated at a higher rate, so it doesn't seem totally out of the realm of credibility that something like 40% of Republicans overall don't want to get the vaccine."
3099,"And that's before you get to the really fun part and realize there's an entire category we haven't even touched on yet, which are the people in that poll who identified as ""Independent."""
3100,"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2019/03/14/political-independents-who-they-are-what-they-think/

Independents actually make up 38% of the electorate (with 31% being registered Dems, and 26% being Repubs)."
3101,"So, of the over 65 crowd, Trump must have captured a good portion of the independent voters to hit the 51% mark."
3102,"Only 22% of Independents refuse the vaccine, as opposed to 43% of Republicans, per the poll, so if Trump won a sizable number if Independents (and he did) that would move the needle on my above math and get us closer to what the poll indicated, meaning something in the neighborhood of mid-30% of Republicans over 65 didn't get the vaccine."
3103,"Additionally, other polls have found similar numbers!"
3104,"Like this one: https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/dashboard/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-dashboard/ (, over 11,000 interviews, 29% Republicans refuse), or this one: http://maristpoll.marist.edu/npr-pbs-newshour-marist-poll-results-the-biden-administration-covid-19/#sthash.cI8mHWqH.dpbs (1.200+ polled, 49% of R men refuse, 34% of R women refuse)

3265,"A bunch of bullshit that turned out to be, eh?"
3266,"This is going to sound stupid, but is there any chance someone tries to get vaccinated like a dozen times?"
3267,Just admit you don't give a shit about masks instead blaming inconsistent messaging from a government agency.
3268,"I do it all the time, fuck masks."
3269,I wear them when I go shopping on the off chance they may stop me from infecting people but that's about it.

3271,"I don't know about Atlanta specifically, but Georgia has one of the worst vaccination rates in the country."
3272,Definitely risking another surge if they reopen too soon.
3273,And Georgia has been open to everyone getting fully vaccinated for a month longer than most places in the US.

3283,I don't see that anywhere in my comment.
3284,"I said that ""going back to normal"" with no restrictions at all is still a risk...as evidenced by the CDC saying there are still activities that vaccinated should wear masks when participating in."
3285,Some of those habits may have formed early in the pandemic when hand sanitizer was difficult to find.

3297,"Even assuming absolutely zero overlap between people who've been vaccinated and people who've been infected (definitely not the case) and that partial immunity from one shot is just as good as full vaccination is just as good as natural immunity, that's 230M/330M, which is right on the cusp of - but not quite at!"
3298,- theoretical herd immunity.
3299,"Once you start stripping away those simplifying assumptions, though you end up in a somewhat worse situation, clearly well short of herd immunity (maybe at a place where there's enough immunity that transmission is noticeably down tho)."

3372,"While there is a nuance to all of this as there are different types of deficiencies will impact immune response, at the end of the day that's what immunodeficiency means: at least some part of the immune response is compromised."
3373,This is one of the reasons why we should strive for herd immunity.
3374,Not everyone is fully protected by vaccines.
3375,What‚Äôs the password?
3376,‚Äú14% of people who have tested positive for covid-19 have symptoms which subsequently linger for more than three months.

3383,Was it April 13th?
3384,Vaccination rates drop significantly after that date.

3386, Pills cost pennies.
3387,Greed costs lives...   That's pretty much capitalism in a nutshell.
3388,This whole pandemic should illustrate to all humans of the world that governments/corporations don't care about people unless those people have $.
3389,If only poor people got covid there wouldn't be any vaccines for 20 years because research would rely on small donations.

3415,"Mine has 280,000."
3416,There is no way for me to go out and get coffee without walking past 50+ people in those two blocks.
3417,My point was that it makes no sense for NZ and AUS to be doing these random 3-7 day lockdowns with China and Vietnam not doing so.
3418,"And as for China, didn't they weld people into their homes?"
3419,"An internet search for it gives a bunch of maybe not completely reliable sources that say they did, but absolutely nothing saying they didn't."
3420,"Maybe it isn't confirmed beyond reasonable doubt, but I'd say it does have preponderance of the evidence."
3421,And to enforce it the way they did it requires a surveillance state at the very minimum.
3422,Even South Korea had the surveillance state thing going on.
3423,My understanding (albeit just from reading random comments from folks from India) is that many rural areas don't even report deaths in any official manner.
3424,I suspect we'll just end up with estimate somewhere down the line.
3425,"Honestly, there's more than a few countries where we're going to end up with just educated guesses."
3426,It'll be like one of those Wikipedia articles about a historical thing where they cite various death estimates with a huge range.
3427,How is it a high risk activity if you're both vaccinated and the covid rate in your area is low?
3428,"I don‚Äôt know, Brad."
3429,"Yes, they were dropping for a long time."
3430,Now they are steady to very slowly declining at 150-200 cases per day for the last month and a half.
3431,I gave this some thought today and I think you are right.
3432,I was actually really curious how it would work out so I made an equation to estimate the total number of people protected per state.
3433,"Depending on delta from average vaccinated population, I weighted the total cases that overlap with vaccinated individuals."
3434,There are quite a few liberties taken but what this revealed is that more rural states benefitted more from natural immunity.

3443,IF IT WERE _TRUE_!!
3444,But too bad it‚Äôs not!‚Äù You read into it way too much.
3445,"3 main reasons: new variant, too many people letting their guards down, and an incompetent government more interested in policking than actually doing the work of epidemic control."
3446,Essentially the same reason the US kept having resurgent waves in 2020.
3447,It's just that this time the consequence is more catastrophic because India doesnt have the resources and the infrastructure of the US to mitigate the spread and treat the ill.
3448,2nd moderna for me yesterday.

3453,"Healthcare worker here, can‚Äôt afford to just let all the unvaccinated people get infected."
3454,"Truly worrisome, aren't other countries showing the 50% of all population mark kind of being the sweet spot?"
3455,so jusst wear masks for the rest of our life?
3456,Id rather die.
3457,That drop occurred when restrictions were in place.
3458,Modeling when to lift restrictions based on that seems a little...uhh... simple-minded?
3459,"Considering that the idea is still being worked on, perhaps reserve judgement for when a plan is actually proposed with details."
3460,"I wouldn't be surprised if by the time they work out an implementation, COVID will no longer be a problem for many countries and the idea will just get dropped."
3461,&gt; re we ever going to know the true amount of people who will have died from this in the future?
3462,We will not.
3463,"If I know exactly what day I would get as head cold, I definitely would"

3467,How is this possible
3468,Ibspent 10 years of appearance self improvement only for my face to be covered by a mask now.
3469,"id take 10 needles a day if I could get rid of it, its by far the worst part od the pandemic for me."
3470,much worse than any of the other restrictions.
3471,10 years wasted for nothing.
3472,"The differential between elderly and non-elderly cases is not nearly as great for hospitalization as it is for deaths, particularly with the variants."
3473,"In other words, they can."
3474,Welcome to the Pfizer Pfam.
3475,"This is really sad, man."
3476,Hope the dead will rest in peace.
3477,...but it doesn't.
3478,One place may have 20% of their population ineligible and in another place it may be 30%.
3479,The latter place literally has to hit a higher vaccination rate of their eligible population to get the same effect.
3480,The percentage of eligible population vaccinated are entirely incomparable and really don't have any meaning.
3481,"Isn't this an entire story on what ""gravediggers"" (sic) are going through in India?"
3482,What other knowledge do you have to share?
3483,"Well it's probably a good thing that it doesn't appear like they have any power whatsoever then, isn't it?"
3484,"For real, how are children born in 2006/2007 using reddit of all things lol, mind boggling to me."
3485,What a weird and condescending comment lol
3486,"Right I knew of the 12-15, was referring to the ""6 months to 11 years"" part."
3487,"While I am happy the more that can get it the better, as a father of 5 and 2 year olds, that's more what I'm looking forward to on a personal level."
3488,"Shit I just got my shot 30 minutes ago feel very mild dizziness and fatigue, hope it doesn‚Äôt last too long, but WORTH IT"
3489,Actually I think the studies rather tested the efficacy in preventing severe covid.
3490,They never really tested transmissibility.
3491,That being said I do agree with your point.
3492,This sort of reminds me California saying you are allowed to watch the sunset.
3493,Biden's goal of basically having it all packed it up in time for July 4th is looking more and more likely.
3494,I think you confused yourself.
3495,"I‚Äôve never said you said anything besides ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, what?‚Äù."
3496,That‚Äôs what you said in response to my comment about violent thoughts.
3497,"Reading comprehension is important, clearly."
3498,Yes.
3499,The growth is more in the areas where it is celebrated but less so in areas where they don't go out to celebrate it like they do in the north.
3500,I just hope this virus changes all those practices which IMO are over the top.
3501,"&gt;Also, the numbers do not include the chance that an unvaccinated person would be infected, which would not be 100%."
3502,"Without that, you can't actually compare the efficacy."
3503,Again I'm not commenting on the efficacy of the vaccines in a vacuum.
3504,I'm just showing you what's actually happening to vaccinated people in the general public.
3505,You're reading into this way more than you should.
3506,"&gt;We're looking at how likely they are to catch it compares to the inactivated population,

Nope again I was only commenting on how the vaccine  performs in reality."
3507,"&gt;The person also said it was ""virtually impossible"", yet you assume 1-in-a million is a euphemism for very unlikely?"
3508,Yeah I guess you missed the part where I said you're both wrong.
3509,Idk why you keep bringing this up because  I really couldn't give a fuck what they said.
3510,"I was commenting on your 1 in 20 number, in which you assumed 100% infection."
3511,which is not even close to reality and therefore a pretty useless number if you're someone whose wondering how often people still get covid after they've been vaccinated.
3512,The 1 in 20 means nothing unless you're a fully vaccinated person allowing a covid positive person to spit in your mouth.
3513,"Yeah, but you can't give salmonella to your friend, who gives it to his brother, who gives it to grandma and kills her."
3514,Wow.

3536,India is a big place with a huge population.
3537,Certain urban areas have  covid clusters but if all of India were similarly infected the scale of crisis would be unbelievable.
3538,"This is what a mild crisis in India looks like, because there's hardly any excess capacity built into infrastructure whether at hospitals or mortuaries."
3539,Even on ordinary pre-pandemic days at most good well equipped city hospitals I've had to wait 3-4 hours to get a bed.
3540,"I've had this experience several times in the past few years to admit friends,  family and myself."
3541,Lots of old people in my family who needed hospitalization and ultimately cremation.
3542,Similarly at the crematorium on an ordinary day I've had to wait a few hours and give a bribe to get a slot.
3543,There's usually one or two bodies in the queue and often the electric furnace  would break down and they'd send for a mechanic.

3570,"There are ways to make sure they are weighed fairly that sometimes are used and sometimes aren‚Äôt used, but we live in a world of people, so there‚Äôs gonna be mistakes."
3571,"Just for you, I went and dug up the source I remembered:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7215164/

The gist is that veterinarians and cat owners appeared to be getting sick from covid-19 less often with fewer symptoms."
3572,"&gt;""I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs not going to be later 2021, early 2022 for that younger age group,"" she said."
3573,Vaccinated with one of the mRNA vaccines.
3574,"&gt; At this point, why should I care about people not wearing masks and aren't vaccinated?"
3575,"Yeah, because we need to reach herd immunity, to actually stamp the disease out."
3576,"Otherwise it'll keep spreading in the vectors available to it, potentially mutate, and be worse and/or evolve into a vaccine resistant strain."
3577,"&gt; but by June there is absolutely no reason that everyone who wants a vaccine in the US won't have their first dose

By June, or sometime in June, we will likely reach herd immunity at current rates, if not earlier."
3578,I‚Äôll wear a mask in my car alone occasionally but that‚Äôs only if I‚Äôm being really insecure.
3579,Also it's not been clearly telegraphed by the media that one of the vaccines is already approved for 16 and 17 year olds.
3580,I have been to the office once since March 2020 and have not eaten indoor at a restaurant since then.
3581,I haven‚Äôt been too worried about going to stores though since mask usage is pretty much 100% in my area.
3582,I just got my second shot yesterday so I plan to travel again soon and won‚Äôt be worried about getting COVID.
3583,But I still plan to pretty much follow the CDC‚Äôs recommendations because thousands of Americans are still dying of this virus and I figure the CDC‚Äôs epidemiologists know better than me what is safe and responsible.
3584,Or just don‚Äôt have Facebook.
3585,"It still amazes me how everyone needs Facebook...‚ÄùI just use it for xyz‚Äù

Delete Facebook"
3586,4+ million people with one dose.
3587,Stabilized at about 30-40k first dose shots daily after a drop in demand.
3588,Hard to pin point exactly because NJ doesn‚Äôt release first dose data daily as far as I can tell.
3589,At the current rate we‚Äôll definitely hit 70 percent adult population by June.
3590,I think we‚Äôll hit 60 percent population in June and 70 percent in august but maybe I‚Äôm being overly optimistic.
3591,Either way things are looking good
3592,I had to push my baby out wearing a mask (1.5 hours üôÉ).
3593,Plus it was so early in the pandemic and PPE supply was so uncertain/sparse that I used my cloth mask not a surgical one ü•µ
3594,Do...do they have to come willingly?
3595,Just asking for a friend that totally isn't me that could use some cash.
3596,This study is significant because it represents the high effectiveness of the mRNA vaccines  in real world data not just during the clinical trials.
3597,It would really help us in achieving Biden's goal of declaring the US epidemic over by the 4th of July if it was approved for ages 12-15 in time to ramp things up and gets us to 70% sometime during June
3598,At what point do we just open things back up?
3599,There's no way hospitals can get overwhelmed with most seniors vaxxed

3601,Big facepalm lol.
3602,No J&amp;J for them.
3603,Gotta go for the 2 - $50s
3604,I am vaccinated.
3605,Is there really any reason I should care if someone is unvaccinated and not wearing a mask?
3606,"The chance of me contracting the virus is minuscule and my symptoms will be mild if I do, and I have a smaller chance of spreading it."
3607,"At this point, why should I care about people not wearing masks and aren't vaccinated?"
3608,"I feel for immunocompromised people, but eventually, these precautions need to end."
3609,Everyone in the US is now eligible for a vaccine.
3610,"I understand it doesn't happen overnight, but by June there is absolutely no reason that everyone who wants a vaccine in the US won't have their first dose."
3611,"I'm not saying you're one of them as I don't think you are, but it seems like there's a huge subset of people that are unwilling to let the pandemic end."
3612,It's time to move on and start getting back to normalcy.
3613,The government should be forthcoming and let people who have been following their guidelines go back to normal.
3614,"In California, it's never been a requirement, but rather a social convention."

3617,Thank you for this.
3618,I also am in healthcare and it drives me nuts how entitled vaxxed people are acting.
3619,"Wait so I can take the vaccine off, just like I can take off my seatbelt when I'm done driving?"
3620,"For some reason I think the seatbelt is more akin to the mask, not teh vaccine."
3621,They had federal benefits which offered $1000 every two weeks for people who missed work due to illness
3622,100% not.

3646,"California, with almost 40 million people, has a 7-day average of a bit over 1,800 cases/day."
3647,And that's with the lowest positivity rate in the country so CA is doing a good job of finding what few cases exist.

3693,"And more importantly, they're at that level with daily life essentially normal."
3694,Why am I getting this stupid vaccine if I have to act like I never got it in the first place.
3695,It's ridiculous.
3696,At some point everyone is just gonna stop wearing masks if the CDC keeps trying to drag this out forever
3697,Boom yep.

3706,I‚Äôll give you that Im factually incorrect in saying the city of Indy is Trumptastic.
3707,My apologies.
3708,But the state overall is hardcore Trump.
3709,And you can‚Äôt stop that level of Covid ignorance/denial from permeating the race.
3710,"Well, sadly the mass audiences, including the CDC, keep pushing that ‚Äúyes, you too are a spreader even while fully vaccinated!"
3711,"So mask up and stay 6..or 3ft apart, whichever sounds better at the time!‚Äù"
3712,When it comes to real world data there are always confounding factors that makes it impossible to get an accurate number.
3713,"Trial data is more accurate, but never has enough samples to get a precise number."
3714,"For instance in Moderna's trial, there were 9 people hospitalized in the placebo arm and 0 in the vaccine arm (out of ~15000 people in each arm)."
3715,This is why they claimed 100% efficacy at preventing hospitalization.
3716,But this is absurdly misleading on such a small sample; the 95% credible interval (*) from this sample would be 55-100%.
3717,"Of course, that hasn't stopped everyone from incorrectly repeating the 100% number."
3718,"When we have real world data we have a tremendously larger sample size, but then the data isn't controlled so we will inevitably get confounding factors."
3719,With vaccination there are two huge ones: vaccinations are unblinded and self-selecting.
3720,"Because they are unblinded, behavior is likely to (and of course should) change after vaccination to (presumably) increase the risk of exposure."
3721,"And because they are self-selecting, the vaccinations might be given first to people who are at highest risk of exposure (e.g., healthcare workers or group care residents) or to those who take COVID the most seriously (vaccine early adopters)."
3722,Taken together these could make the risk many times different than what the data shows; actual protection could be 99% for instance if those who were vaccinated were simply 6x more likely to be exposed than those who weren't vaccinated.
3723,"(*) Using a Bayesian estimate from a uniform prior in theta, the probability that the event happens in the vaccine group; read more [here](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2020/11/a-look-at-biontech-pfizers-bayesian-analysis-of-their-covid-19-vaccine-trial/)."
3724,"Not true, covid vaccine does very little for contracting the virus but does make the virus symptoms less fatal."
3725,This is what every article about the vax I‚Äôve read has said.
3726,Also the new variant that is more severe for children and young adults is one of the easier variants to contract and one that the vaxxed can transmit.
3727,They mean the pandemic total for Nepal is equal to a daily total for India.
3728,And the population of Nepal is about 1/365 to India.

3805,What value is it providing?
3806,I really hope this isn't a serious question.
3807,California is rocking it right now.
3808,"Lowest positivity rate in the US, too, so the low case number isn't just from lack of testing."
3809,Major metro areas have high vaccine uptake (the SF Bay Area is already at around 70% of all adults with at least one dose).
3810,Producing the vaccine at cost/with no profit doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean the price will be the same everywhere.
3811,If the cost is higher (e.g.
3812,"they have less/no capability to manufacture locally, they need to transport it a longer distance, etc.)"
3813,then the price will be higher.
3814,How that cost varies by country will depend on the infrastructure and supply chain used by the company.
3815,"So they're safe cuz they got a vaccine that doesn't prevent it or stop the spread ü§î

3816,&gt;it can't have been a significant enough amount for them to be able to force AstraZeneca to break their UK contract.

3818,Why would *any* EU money be spent on British plants if they don't deliver to the EU??
3819,"Ditto the Halix plant, which shipped some drug substance to the UK instead of stockpiling for the EU, and would've exported doses later if the EU hadn't put a lid on it."
3820,"If AZ can't prove they invested literally all EU money into that one Belgian plant, they got a problem."
3821,Nah

3831,"I think at this point I‚Äôm gonna get it right after my last exam which is another week or 2 out - or, if they‚Äôre still taking walk-ins, I‚Äôll just chance the side effects and walk in at our mass site in Philly tomorrow (because they have vaccines that are gonna go to waste tomorrow)."

3877,likely it‚Äôs a mix of both but i wonder how it would have gone if every politician was emphatic about wearing a mask was a must.
3878,i know for a fact that would have spelled political doom for some of them cause their base would not have it.
3879,"A couple weeks ago, I was at the drive-thru at my bank, making a deposit."
3880,"In the lane next to mine, a guy pulls up in his car and puts his mask on to talk to the teller."
3881,"He's in his car, alone."
3882,Except Fauci even mentioned that vaccines are good against India variant yesterday on tv.
3883,He‚Äôs privy to data and research.
3884,Also India is less than 10% vaccinated.
3885,Good try though.
3886,"Also, not wearing a mask outside is okay (endorsed by CDC)."
3887,You are either trolling with your post intentionally or ridiculously uniformed.
3888,I love this thing that social media people do where they pretend that it's gully the physical act of wearing a mask that people are against and not that masks are a reminder that things aren't normal every single time you see another person.
3889,You could at least try to understand where people are coming from
3890,Hi everyone.
3891,Question about AZ.
3892,My doc and pharmacist both advised me that I should not take AZ due to my low platelet count.
3893,"I understand that the blood clots that are being reported are ""blood clots with low platelets""."
3894,"Is it the vaccine that causes the low platelets, or is it that people with low platelets are more susceptible to blood clots?"
3895,I'm a little heartbroken because I've been waiting patiently to get my shot and now I'm going to be waiting that much longer for Moderna or Pfizer due to my age category (40+).
3896,Any information would be most appreciated.

3898,We are definitely reaching the point where doses are being wasted in the US.
3899,"They have expiration dates, and also if you open a vial (They are stored in multi-dose vials), you got to use up that vial in a few hours."
3900,"I think per capita, The US will end up wasting more doses than a country with less vaccine hesitancy, such as England."
3901,"It's important to meet people where they are but it will inevitably result in some wasted doses... example, it's important to go out to community centers and other places where people congregate or shop (dollar generals, etc) but this will inevitably lead to wasted doses."
3902,"Meanwhile, other countries haven't even vaccinated their health care workers."

3920,"Hes diabetic, hypertensive and asthmatic and 60+ years old."
3921,He could barely even get out of bed.
3922,Awful coughs and couldn‚Äôt breath properly for weeks.
3923,Hispanic stubbornness made him not seek medical attention so im pretty sure he got so bad he would have been hospitalized.
3924,but even if he had gotten to that level i wouldnt have known.
3925,They told me like 2 months after he got better.
3926,"&gt; ‚ÄúIf someone who had been at your party was infected and died, as far as I‚Äôm concerned, you‚Äôre guilty of manslaughter."
3927,"If someone who had been at your party was infected and passed it on to grandma, as far as I‚Äôm concerned, you‚Äôre guilty of manslaughter,‚Äù she told him."

3934,"sigh, cheers."
3935,it goes fast.
3936,Do you think those projections are unaccounted for?
3937,The obvious answer is we need more time to figure out.
3938,This is saying 'at least' 7 months.
3939,Right now we are in the 'at least' phase for both infection and vaccine immunity.
3940,"We don't know the far end of the duration

It is a hard question to answer until we know how long the immunity truly lasts."
3941,Could be a year or 10 years.
3942,Only then can we compare immunity given by infection vs vaccine vs a combination.

3950,Much Appreciated!
3951,I think that's the case.
3952,I've been following in my county.
3953,10-20% of people got vaccinated because of their jobs before it was available for everyone over 16.
3954,I'm assuming because 16-19 year olds don't often have jobs very few 16-19 years olds were vaccinated.
3955,For is it's gone from 5% to 47% in six weeks.

3963,"I felt pretty emotional going into it and then when I walked out of the hospital I was just like ""...Is that it?"
3964,"There ought to be confetti or something"""

3984,Laziness.
3985,"For a lot of us it‚Äôs just that, laziness."
3986,Great news
3987,I saw a comment by the SF board of health that was pointing to June as the date 5-11 years olds will be eligible.
3988,I think 5-11 years olds require dosing studies cause they be smol so it'll take a little longer than the 12-15 years olds.
3989,"Some cities, like mine, have mask mandates."
3990,"We‚Äôre still only at 9 hospitalizations per 100,000 residents."
3991,That‚Äôs quite low compared to most of the country.
3992,The lowest you can find out there is 4 per 100k.
3993,Highest is 38 out of 100k.
3994,It‚Äôs increasing sure but still completely manageable.
3995,Especially with vaccines and having over a year to prep.
3996,This is an over reaction by the governor in my opinion and doubtful to last very long.

4032,Opening everything up will be a disaster vaccine or no vaccine.
4033,Right???
4034,"My governor have said ""just a bit longer"" with zero numbers since January."
4035,I have no idea how you can keep you chin up with no carrot to attain on the end of the stick.
4036,In the beginning I think people believed that touching the mask was a method of getting infected.
4037,As an expendable worker who has been forced into overtime throughout the pandemic I definitely feel this.

4051,"And we are saying this with our current RT-PCR tests that are known to be not completely accurate, and often miss low grade infections."
4052,Cough is not one of the shot side effects.
4053,"Could be spring allergies (runny allergy nose can irritate throat and cause cough), but if you‚Äôre still coughing tomorrow, get a COVID test to see if you need to quarantine from others."

4111,Crazy what happens when the  whole world puts their money together for a vaccine.
4112,If only it was always like this for medicine and science.
4113,Without any precautions vaccines are only 90% effective but with the same precautions people used through the pandemic like social distancing and wearing a mask can get that protection near 100%.

4120,*
4121,That‚Äôs why I said another possibility was to just read it and have the arguments ready.
4122,You got me thinking about the affiliation of governors and their track record for COVID-19 deaths per capita.
4123,"Red governors average 160.5 deaths per 100k, while blue governors average 159.0."
4124,"Given the variance, these differences are not significant."
4125,"[I've plotted this against population density](https://imgur.com/a/aPHajdB), and again I don't see much of a difference."
4126,"So regardless of whether governors ""take the virus and safety precautions seriously"" it doesn't seem to have much of an effect."
4127,"Ah yes, [‚Äúdemocrats‚Äù](https://m.youtube.com/watch?t=369&amp;v=7zthJUf31MA&amp;feature=youtu.be)."
4128,40% of a party saying they won‚Äôt get vaccinated is a popular minority.
4129,"Democratic pundits don‚Äôt advocate for rioting, et cetera, et cetera."
4130,Let‚Äôs take your argument on merit anyway.
4131,"If democratic pundits were to truly rally behind political violence as a means to their ends, it should then be a well-intentioned democratic voters onus to disavow such actions."
4132,Anything less is complicitous in nature.
4133,&gt;Where do children who lose both parents go?
4134,This is another problem in our country after so many years of independence and population growth we have no good system to support kids either orphaned or abused.
4135,Mostly we depend on NGOs to take care of these kids and there is little or no monitoring of these.
4136,So often there are news stories of abuse in these orphanage.
4137,"I have personally been donating to some if these NGO for kids education costs anything between 8 - 12 k pa per kid, encourage everyone who is earning to do so."
4138,But we need a good support system from govt.
4139,"NGO and society for such children, after all kids are our future."
4140,Is anyone going to attend?
4141,"Won't it just mostly be athletes, who are all being vaccinated and everyone else watching it on TV."
4142,Then find some numbers.
4143,Go on then!
4144,Are people just cool with being violently ill for potential weeks?
4145,Because I never thought I would die if I got covid.
4146,But I definitely knew I would be the sickest I have ever been and that's why I got the vaccine.
4147,IHME models India at 14m infections per day at the peak earlier this week.
4148,"Even at the low end of IFR estimates, that would result in 30-40k deaths."
4149,and I am nervous about attending
4150,Nobody who believes any of those three points will read a CNN article.
4151,They'll dismiss it as schmake schnews.
4152,This time a year ago I remember reading about Iran and these sorts of statements.
4153,"One that struck me when there was no testing available, Grandma brought food and left it at the door."
4154,"Mother, father and daughter lived in the loungeroom prostrate and all together to keep an eye on each other."
4155,God help you.
4156,username checks out.
4157,You're also wrong.
4158,a scenario where some variant comes out making the vaccines useless is compelling science fiction but that's about it.
4159,"Yeah I agree it's definitely all about perspective, I guess I'm in the same boat that I've spent too much time indoors and on the internet so I feel like it's real life when it's really not lol

I think that's the sentiment in a lot of places tbh LA is active rn"

4341,I keep seeing this claim but see no proof of it or data that indicates that.
4342,"The rate of mutation of SARS-CoV-2 is much lower than the influenza virus and while spike proteins can mutate so to **reduce** effectiveness of antibody response, antibodies in themselves aren't reflective of a long-term immune response to the virus."
4343,For that we have to look to memory B cells which can last a lifetime and T-cells which could potentially last years (People who got SARS in the early 2000s still have T-cells for the virus).
4344,And so far the variants don't show any resistance to T-cell response and it doesn't seem like they will.
4345,Also a new study dropped that shows that mRNA vaccines also produce T-cells.
4346,"Not that the cnn article in itself is a wrong idea, I just think you shouldn't lie and try to scare people for them to get vaccinated."

4383,One of the things Spain did early on was specify that triage decisions should not be made by physicians and other staff providing care to the patients.
4384,They should be made by a neutral medical bureaucracy which consider the survival odds of each case.

4481,In the US I would have been treated if possible but had a hefty bill (or more likely set of bills) afterwards.
4482,"I really wish I could have been treated for it in Germany, because they were so willing and on the ball with what they were able to do in my condition."
4483,I don't know where you get your information but oecd has different one.

4531,*
4532,I agree with that sentiment.
4533,"The sweeping generalized statements that are used for headlines and other posts can do a number on us subconsciously, and we do need to be much more careful with our language- *especially* when it‚Äôs painting someone else with a negative brush!"
4534,&gt; You need to stop propagating this myth.
4535,"&gt; 
&gt; You have no clue how long the waiting times are."
4536,How clinics will outright refuse you to admit saying they are full.
4537,"&gt; 
&gt; How ER will send you back saying go get a note from your HausArtz even if you are clearly suffering."
4538,How doctors won't conduct more extensive tests to find the issue.
4539,"How a doctor would say oh you meet 3/4 criteria and since its not 4/4 , we cannot give you a diagnosis."
4540,"&gt; 
&gt; How you need to travel sometimes 70 + Kms one way beacuse that's where you could get an appointment as clinics in your city are full."
4541,"German here with variouse medical conditions (sever foot disability, asthma, allergies) and family with more conditions (MS, Autism, artificial hips and knees)."
4542,The only real issues I had in my life with health insurance was when I wanted additional shoes and when I demanded refunds for my medical travles to the other side of Germany because I wanted to go to one of the world's best surgeons for my foot disability.
4543,Look at the vaccination numbers in the Northeast.
4544,Look at the deep south.
4545,"Finally, something that makes sense."
4546,Michigan was down around 1200 cases a day before the peak around mid February.
4547,"At that time the US as a whole was dropping rapidly from 80,000 to 70,000 cases."
4548,"The US bottom out mid March around 55,000 cases when Michigan was at 2,500 cases just starting their rise."
4549,"Michigan reached a peak around mid April at 7,500 cases while at that time the US was at a peak or 71,000 cases."
4550,That means during the small rise in cases the US experienced during that month long period about 33% of cases came from Michigan even though they are only 3% of the population of the United states.
4551,The peak the US experienced was almost solely due to Michigan as seen by the fact both went down in cases at the same time.
4552,Probably because this population is older and the first dose creates a more robust immune response in a younger population.
4553,Also I didn‚Äôt read the article yet if this isn‚Äôt relevant
4554,Japan has a bad history with vaccination.
4555,It‚Äôs created outbreaks of AIDS.
4556,Hepatitis.
4557,Etc.
4558,their past has come to haunt them.
4559,And they are very very careful about drug approval.
4560,Also why they have only authorized Pfizer and also why they haven‚Äôt produced any vaccines under license yet.
4561,"This person was stating a fact, they didn't even advocate for a position."
4562,"I actually live there and have several pre-existing conditions, so I can assure you from first hand experience that what you're saying is mostly BS, starting with doctors or ER staff turning you away when suffering (that's actually prohibited by law), and if you're not content with basic UHC, you can always upgrade to a private insurance carrier, pay more and get yourself some VIP treatment in exchange."
4563,What I feel is much more important though is that in Germany _everyone_ has a human right to get necessary medical treatment and is insured to receive it at minimal costs.
4564,"Now don't get me wrong, would I claim the German HC system is perfect?"
4565,"Of course not, there's still an awful lot to criticise about it, and there are other countries with differently build UHC systems doing a much better job at being cost effective, but compared to the hugely expensive, predatory and exploitative US system, it's still almost paradise."
4566,"He needs to announce something before Memorial Day weekend, because the Shore is going to be insane whether he does anything or not."
4567,This is excellent approachable info.
4568,I‚Äôve shared it with my immediate family.
4569,"I have extended family that is ‚Äúhesitant‚Äù still, shall we say."
4570,I expect to get lit up for my insensitivity and rudeness for sharing this info with them.
4571,"It's a valid opinion, but not one public health professionals are allowed to have."
4572,It's also interesting seeing that the two most common discourses on here are mutually  incompatible.
4573,"Namely: 1) the cdc is dumb, it should clearly incentivize being vaccinated, people won't get vaccinated because they don't see that restrictions will change based on immunization percentage and individual status."
4574,"2) open everything up, people have had a chance to get vaccinated, if they haven't by now, fuckem."
4575,"This not even including that most of the places with very low immunization rates are already ""open""."
4576,"In Germany, we started shipping doses to every GP and that really helped to accelerate the rollout."
4577,I was donating blood two days ago and I overheard one of the donors using these talking points.
4578,Then **the fucking Red Cross worker** agreed with her and started using some more of these talking points.
4579,Honestly Facebook has ruined the people in the United States.
4580,why do it if vaccinated?
4581,Going to get my second dose of Sinovac (CoronaVac) eight days from now.
4582,"I can't wait of course, but I've heard that some countries don't recognize certain vaccine brands when it comes to allowing travelers in."
4583,"Knowing that, I plan to get Moderna through a family member's company some time down the line -- most likely July this year as my country has been rather slow to get other brands."
4584,Is it safe to get Moderna on top of Sinovac?
4585,"If so, how long should I wait before the Moderna jab?"
4586,Do I even have to wait at all?
4587,"Again, zero mention of the number of tests done."
4588,But I'm going to assume it's still very low.
4589,Japan has willingly let the virus spread throughout it's country and their government has proven to be incompetent.
4590,The only thing stopping it from being terrible over there is the incredible mask compliance.
4591,"About 10 million, which is 10s of millions less than what was supposed to be produced by now"
4592,Half the restrictions in NYC make zero sense.
4593,Bar curfews?
4594,Food while at a bar?
4595,Masks outside for all?
4596,"Sorry, public officials don‚Äôt get a pass on shitty policy a year into this thing."
4597,"The premise is flawed, SK and Japan do not aim for elimination."
4598,Since when has Japan aimed for elimination?
4599,Doesn't look like it from the data
4600,Your comment is as well spoken as it is incorrect.
4601,You cant have a chance for reinfection if you are not exposed to the virus.
4602,You would need to adjust for infection rate.
4603,19mil also includes partial vaccinations.

Just put this into google."
4614,"I didn't make the calculation

Why not keep drugs at home and not bother other people with it?"
4615,"&gt; I'd prefer German smoking rates over US child mortality rates any given

I didn't say US is utopia, just that there are better options than Germany."
4616,The US was an extreme example to point out how expensive the social contributions in Germany are.
4617,Measles is around forever but we don't have public health measures to stop it because we have a vaccine and herd immunity.
4618,I got sick at the first of March 2020.
4619,I started having eye problems and confusion the last week of February 2020.
4620,Covid hit me hard neurologically.
4621,"Still, over a tear later, dealing with constant double vision as well as blurred."
4622,I did four rounds of antibiotics 4x daily.
4623,At least three rounds of steroids.
4624,It seems that Benadryl is the helps when it gets bad during the day but I can‚Äôt just constantly take that.
4625,I was at a concert doing photography and someone sneezed and overall was just sick (looking back on video I have).
4626,I went around them to get away because at the time Covid really wasn‚Äôt taken seriously and masks weren‚Äôt a thing but I didn‚Äôt want to get sick with anything.
4627,Coincidentally I ended up being one of the first in my state sick with Covid with symptoms showing two days after that specific concert.
4628,Months later still the same issue and my doctor explained it exactly like this.
4629,My contacts were basically a Petri dish and to stop wearing them and not let anyone lick my eyes.
4630,I laughed but I mean...
4631,Bullshit.
4632,Just nonsense.
4633,"You can wear the mask, gloves and everything and still get affected by the virus if one carrier coughs right in your eyes."

4638,"The most factual,  non opion answer I can give based on what has been said on local news in Japan is that they dont have enough ‚Äúqualified staff‚Äù to administer vaccines."

4648,&gt; Yeah sure nothing is free.
4649,It is paid for by taxes.
4650,Why should this be more expensive in the long run.
4651,German health care costs are about half of the US health care costs.

4663,I feel your pain.
4664,Lol
4665,Is Plasma therapy beneficial for covid-19 patients and is there any research to back up the claim if it is?

&amp;#x200B;

i could also have simply called a Ambulance 1 month ago and get my self checked out in hospital instantly but i simply didnt want to cause it doesnt feel threatening and i also got treated by multiple doctors."
4675,"&amp;#x200B;

ER ?"
4676,they will ask what you have and if its High priority get you in early.
4677,if you fear for your life dont go to ER call a Ambulance they drive you straight into hospital INSTANTLY and you get care near instant at that hospital because they make sure PRE bringing you there that they can treat you and got a bed for you.
4678,"&amp;#x200B;

also iam living not in a main city like Berlin literarily living in ""Dortmund"" which is a shit hole and got many ""dont go to"" areas because they are plain criminal areas."
4679,It doesn‚Äôt matter - going to a party and spreading it or going to a grocery store and spreading it.
4680,"Either way it‚Äôs continuing on unknowingly, and those that are carriers must pay."
4681,"The govt basically still doesn't have distribution plans together, and only MDs and nurses are allowed to give the injections."
4682,It's just stunning incompetence.
4683,"They had a year to plan this, but in Japan, no one takes any initiative lest something go wrong and they get blamed."
4684,"They typically are asymptotic, but are carriers."
4685,[removed]
4686,Maybe just to clarify - vaccines will reduce the risk of transmission.
4687,"Maybe at the same rate of reducing symptomatic disease, though my guess is a little bit less."
4688,So say 80 percent effective at reducing transmission.
4689,Certainly enough to reduce case numbers dramatically.
4690,But the US is going to be in a weird spot where 30 percent of the country refuses all mitigation measures including vaccines and masks - it will be an interesting test to see if natural immunity is less effective long term than vaccinated immunity.
4691,Europe is not EU only.
4692,In my country I'll probably get a vaccine in 2022
4693,Seriously people bring up wait times for countries with socialized healthcare but forget to mention people wait years in America because they cant afford to even get diagnosed let alone treatment.
4694,"Can't shake hands, can't bump eye balls... what next?"
4695,"As an European, two months ago I also thought that I won‚Äôt get vaccinated before 2022."
4696,But the speed of the campaign has drastically increased and now we are planning to be done by the end of July.
4697,Fingers crossed that Japan finally gets going.
4698,What is the reason for not using the vaccines that have been imported from Europe ?
4699,39 million doses is a huge number.
4700,Getting them into the people‚Äôs arms would help you a lot.
4701,[removed]
4702,[removed]
4703,All those things happen way more often in America.
4704,Also in America people will ignore medical issues for years because they can't afford the healthcare.

4729,The language barrier is to their advantage.
4730,The WHO was also initially reluctant to get involved to help get it tested which caused a delay in development.
4731,There is no way to test these vaccines in western countries because Ebola is not prevalent there and due to ethical considerations testing it in Africa.
4732,Secondly Ebola comes in unpredictable bursts in remote areas so trials are difficult to run.
4733,Also research funding is always scarce for almost any uncommon disease and even many common diseases.

4749,I understand people are desperate but doing this will further spread the disease and kill even more people.
4750,[deleted]
4751,That‚Äôs incredible.
4752,"If even those people are reduced to mild/asymptomatic illness, it really shows how fantastic the vaccines are."
4753,"Because, incredible as it might seem, Modi is even more arrogant and stupid than Bolsonaro but neither are as stupid as their supporters who appear to make up the majority of voters in each country."
4754,Blood clots are common among people who are sedentary for long periods of time.
4755,"At any given time, your body has several very small clots circulating, usually they're benign and other organs in your body help clear them."
4756,"There's even names for it like ""traveler's disease"" and ""economy class syndrome""."
4757,"Women can be more susceptible in youth because hormones like estrogen, progesterone, and oxytocin can promote clotting."
4758,"Its unfortunate, but from the sound of it, it doesn't sound like COVID."
4759,People are super quick to blame COVID.

4764,*
4765,"Ah yes, like when the UK newspapers released articles claiming vaccines were only 8% efficient, when the UK jeopardize the NI peace process, when the UK leaders repeatedly and publicly undermined vaccine approval, when the UK successfully raided one of its own finishing sites, when the UK repeatedly released dozens of incorrect press releases, when the UK repeatedly threatened legal action, or when the UK ignored that its own bureaucracy was the reason for its slow progress."
4766,"Oh, wait.... No that's all EU, sorry!"
4767,"Let's see, what did the UK do that makes its behaviour so wrong..."
4768,Successful early initialising of manufacturing sites?
4769,No wait that's a good thing.
4770,Successful early approval of vaccines?
4771,"No, not that."
4772,Successful switching to longer intervals?
4773,"Nope, nothing wrong there."
4774,Staying silent in the press while others made fools of themselves?
4775,Nailed that.
4776,"Ah I see what the UK did wrong, it didn't make itself an easy target for the leeches in Brussels to use as a distraction, and that must be punished."
4777,I don‚Äôt think masks are a big deal *because* I‚Äôve been wearing them for the past year.
4778,They were only a real inconvenience when the pandemic kicked off and I hadn‚Äôt adjusted to them yet.
4779,Fair point but the worst of the infections happend after the vaccination drive started so those 4 months were the worst 4 months.
4780,"Even if we assume that in all of those months you had an equal chance of getting covid (which you didn't), unvaccinated people have been getting covid for 3 times longer."
4781,So 1 in 30?
4782,"Really a drop I the bucket compared to 1 in 14,000"
4783,to protect you just in case you're part of that 5 to 10% that still gets infected despite being vaccinated.
4784,"While you most likely won't be hospitalized, you will have to quarantine and potentially miss work."
4785,"For a white collar professional who can work from home for the next 10 days it's no big deal, but a shift worker at a retail store or an Instacart shopper will have their finances impacted with that length of time off on sick leave."
4786,"At this point in the pandemic we're trying to reboot the economy, to open it up fully, and that means trying to minimize the % of ppl calling in sick who need to quarantine."
4787,"As we've seen with the production of computer chips, employee sickness &amp; absenteeism can a have a huge impact on a sector's productivity and wreck havoc on ancillary goods &amp; services."

4793,So I can't see why a buffet orgy would be a problem.
4794,"Had suppliers known in march 2020 that anyone was allowed to produce vaccine once they were developed then obviously the supply had been much better now, because you reduce the response time in the supply chains."
4795,[removed]
4796,I get what you're saying.
4797,But we have tied vaccination to restrictions and they are two separate things.
4798,Restrictions were created by law makers and companies.
4799,If a company today wanted to ift its mask mandate it could regardless of how many people are vaccinated.
4800,"I never got any trouble for it, plus my state had a straightforward ‚Äúmust wear masks if you‚Äôre indoors and not eating/drinking‚Äù."

4814,"The software uses deep learning to detect abnormalities in the chest X-rays and then creates a heat map of suspicious areas in the lungs and provides a score, from 0 to 100, that suggests the likelihood of an infection."
4815,Tbh I have lived in Ohio my whole life and find cedar point to be a waste of money.
4816,The lines are so long and it‚Äôs overpriced.
4817,They really lost me when they acquired Wild water kingdom which was awesome and closed it the year before they started pushing their water park.
4818,"Businesses have a right to choose their own policies, even if we do not agree with them so I guess just don‚Äôt go if you don‚Äôt like it."
4819,I wish the anti maskers would follow this with businesses who ask them to wear a mask.
4820,It‚Äôs their policies.
4821,So fucking typical that you‚Äôve been downvoted here.
4822,So many people are proud of being dumb.
4823,Bc there are plenty of people who will not be able to take the vaccine for medical purposes.
4824,"Auto-immune disorders, allergies, bad reaction to first dose."
4825,"You are doing it for the same reason you wore a mask, to protect others from you (remember the mask doesn‚Äôt really protect you from others"
4826,"Tell her in the future if that happens again to drink a bunch of water, maybe Gatorade for faster absorption."
4827,"Heavy periods can actually cause enough blood loss to impact your blood volume, which will make you dizzy when getting up because the body is struggling to maintain adequate blood pressure."
4828,I kind of had that issue up until I got diagnosed with von willebrand disease (I'm deficient in that particular clotting factor) and my hematologist told me that's actually a an early sign of hypovolemic shock.
4829,All those times It was getting really bad and I was ignoring it I apparently should have been going to the ER.
4830,I don't really have the issue now because I have medication I can use when the bleeding gets really bad and I know to force down fluids when I start feeling a bit light headed- I keep Gatorade on hand at all times.

4838,Normal people as in not fully vaccinated?
4839,"Just under 33M

So about 1 in 10."
4840,"Some vaccines aren‚Äôt able to effectively stop viruses from spreading, they just stop symptoms."
4841,That‚Äôs not an ideal vaccine bc then you are dealing with potential for ‚Äúleaky‚Äù vaccine scenario.
4842,There are examples of this in certain livestock vaccines.
4843,What you end up with is a more virulent dangerous strain.
4844,"That being said, most human vaccines aren‚Äôt leaky like this."
4845,However the COVID vaccine is new technology that lacks the same testing as other vaccines.
4846,So it‚Äôs a good question to ask
4847,"Yeah, not in Canada."
4848,Dug in and found the article.

4851,"Uh, sorry, no."
4852,"Not complaining just curious, but why is it safer for vaccinated people to wear masks?"
4853,I‚Äôm vaccinated and wear my mask but someone asked me why and I couldn‚Äôt really give them a good reason why aside from easing peoples minds
4854,"
I‚Äôm just trying to see if I can find information on neurological issues from covid and I saw they talk a lot about how covid can affect orexin neuron degeneration."

4867,I pray that the latter option of people getting vaccinated to get us to normal will be that option.
4868,It's really annoying living here (in the uk) with this hyperbolic press.
4869,It really does brainwash people.
4870,We'll get herd immunity by ending this ridiculous lockdown.
4871,"Yes vaccines would help that, but so would just being exposed to the virus, which for non-seriors is not that dangerous."
4872,[removed]
4873,See chickenpox.
4874,Three out of four COVID-19 deaths were not in the Americas.
4875,If vaccinated people do indeed shed the virus at high rates than that‚Äôs worrying for more reasons than people understand (I‚Äôm sure the CDC knows why): leaky vaccine mutations.
4876,"When a virus is able to live within a vaccinated person it tends to mutate to be more virulent, not less."
4877,"That‚Äôs why this question is so important and, I‚Äôm sure, the real reason the CDC still wants you to mask up even if vaccinated"
4878,"Sorry, I was being a bit of a smart ass."
4879,I just always found these kind of headlines odd.
4880,Probably not... you may have to leave the eggs runny so they can be absorbed more easily through the skin.
4881,/s
4882,"what do you mean weld people in houses, like have you seen what that look like?"
4883,Also they have 7- 14 day travel quarantines right now and testing in quarantine so i dont know what you mean not doing random lockdowns.
4884,"They dont have lockdowns they have quarantines, and also they started giving vaccines."
4885,Are you suggesting then that this 'minor event' is concluded without further development?
4886,That like choosing a single frame in a film there's just nothing left to see?
4887,"This seems to entirely underplay the dynamics of an infectious disease, the obvious data issues  https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31857-2/fulltext‚Ç© , and as you mentioned  corruption and credibility issues."

4892,Are you staying at home?
4893,"Now that the adults in our family are all vaccinated, we have started to venture out a bit:  masking up to go into uncrowded stores; masked play outdoors with small groups of friends; we even started daycare for our 5 yo for a few days a week after we were satisfied with their covid protocols."

4902,You doubt vaccines?
4903,"Didn‚Äôt India change the rules to approve all vaccines that were approved in the us, Europe, Russia?"

4906,Put the $3mil back into our medical system.
4907,"Small chunk in the bucket for sure, but it'll hurt him way more"
4908,Then why doesnt they use it to producere more vaccines than they do now?
4909,I am sure they producere more or less as much as they can.
4910,I agree.
4911,We should start to use COVID tracing as a way to imprison anyone who gives COVID to another person.
4912,These people that keep giving COVID to others are what has caused this to drag on too long.
4913,[deleted]
4914,"I still remember expert advice said, don't wear a mask because you arent a train professional and don't know how to touch it, so you will actually increase your risk of infection by wearing it."
4915,Nothing like bad advice with a side of condescension.
4916,Amen!
4917,People on this sub are acting like we're in the clear.
4918,We aren't.
4919,"These vaccines are good for what we were dealing with a bit ago and right now, but they are about to be rendered useless at the rate the world is going."
4920,Yes but at the same time the reported numbers are likely to be completely underestimated as there is absolutely no idea of what is happening in more rural areas nor what is happening at peoples homes.
4921,"While yes context matters, on the other hand context matters‚Ä¶ both ways (how much testing per inhabitant do you do, how many excess death do you have?"
4922,Are you aware of all deaths?
4923,How many hospital bed per capita do you have?
4924,Etc).
4925,So yes even put in context this crisis is really bad.
4926,Do you not comprehend?
4927,There are variants in circulation..while not dominant yet...they may become so..that have mostly escaped the vaccine already.
4928,You need to continue wearing a mask until the boosters are out
4929,"Well the entire pharma industry was dominated by Germany until the 60s, and that was when they changed their patent system to a more American style system."
4930,Patents weren't really an issue until the laws of the 1960s.
4931,"Before this drug make up was not patented, but the process to make it was."
4932,Multiple drug companies could make the same thing if getting there different ways.
4933,This was the German way.
4934,"France had medicine patents from 1791, but removed them in 1844."
4935,"Britain allowed medical patents in 1949 after the missed ""national opportunity"" with pencilling."
4936,France switched to medical product patents in 1960 and Germany in 1967.
4937,Until then germany had developed more drugs than anyone else.
4938,The lack of vigor against patents in the medical setting had diminished by the 1960s.
4939,"Us polio, Britain lenecillin, Germany everything."
4940,"The spirit of patent laws and expectations of the medical community remained aimed at providing busineses with a period of monopoly, but only in return for genuine novelty that offered a distinct benefit to the public."

4950,As a random Redditor I'm going to have to say I'm not qualified to give you a real answer.
4951,I'll leave that to the scientists to determine.
4952,But I will say that masks are a great covid anti-measure.
4953,Minimal cost with substantial returns.
4954,Honestly it should be one of the last things to be done away with.
4955,You can do almost everything with a mask on.
4956,"Even high risk activities like school, public transportation, movie theaters, etc."
4957,"It's the closest thing we can have to having our cake and eating it, too."
4958,I can only think of high quality vaccines being a better (if delayed) option.
4959,Thanks for this.
4960,Do you know where I can see first doses given over time?
4961,Why is this bad?
4962,There‚Äôs not much reason to wear a mask outside if you‚Äôre not in a crowd.
4963,Sounds like people are actually following the scientific guidelines.
4964,"My father is a poor, hardworking, Central American migrant who has not yet had the vaccine."
4965,Please wear your mask at all times because think of all the unfortunate people out there you could potentially get sick when innocently walking near them thinking everything is ok. We all need to be doing our parts by continuing to stop the spread by wearing masks when around anyone at all.
4966,Well it's paywalled and I can't read it but I'm not even sure how helpful their vaccine is for global access?
4967,The countries getting the shaft here are the ones where storage and transport of vaccines at extremely cold temperatures is impractical if not impossible.
4968,The adenovirus vector vaccines are far more practical but the problem is as we have seen in India the shortage of supplies needed for manufacturing- patents held by the likes of Millipore-Sigma not the actual vaccine makers.
4969,[removed]
4970,Well we know my Falcons don't fill it up :'(
4971,I definitely felt more glee after the first shot.
4972,Second shot was more of like ‚Äú I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm this close to feeling normal‚Äù
4973,[removed]
4974,Fair enough!
4975,Here we go-this should get interesting.
4976,Fuckin great lol
4977,The EU was a bit bloody quiet when it came to some German politicians leaking what they thought (wrongly) to German media as well as Macron's comments.
4978,How likely is it that this is spurring a new variant that can be spread to other countries?
4979,That is super horrifying if that is something that can happen
4980,"fear mongering click bait, ""Pandemic not over still causing major problems but we are doing a good job fixing it but need to do more."""
4981,would be a more accurate title but doesn't get clicks
4982,That would be good news.
4983,"They have to have data to say, so it's a month to month update."
4984,I'd expect it to end up being 2-3 years since that is what they found for SARS-COV-1.
4985,"It is also a top-2 country by population, so..."
4986,But would it be spotted post mortem?
4987,"Have you looked at Seropositivity numbers in the ""hesitant"" states?"
4988,"They aren't anywhere near herd immunity, this is like India who thought all was clear because lots of people had already been sick once."
4989,Not enough though.
4990,People keep overestimating natural immunity.
4991,"Of course, but we can't stay locked down forever."
4992,There is some threshold of risk that's acceptable because we've never shut down this heavily for any disease in decades.
4993,That would be nice to have but if they gave those guidelines they would have to answer to all the warehouse/grocery store/hospitals/retail/etc essential workers that have been going into work every day since the beginning.
4994,Not everyone is from the states bud.
4995,Studies for 5-12 year old just started and they obviously take a fee months to complete.
4996,My guess would be more early Fall over mid Summer.
4997,"I guess that would be one way to get more people vaccinated, use a replication competent vector to deliver the spike."
4998,"Of course, people will die if the resources they require are lacking."
4999,But I'm not sure if we'll ever hit that stage with our current levels of both vaccine and natural immunity.
5000,I see India's at 8% with 1+ dose so their situation is quite different (also just a more densely populated country I imagine).
5001,"At one point, the decision to choose not to get vaccinated means you are accepting all those risks."
5002,"I'm curious that even if we opened up completely, would it be possible to get hospitals so overloaded that doctors won't be free to help other patients."
5003,god damn.
5004,They haven't done many of those studies yet.
5005,"To test for sterilizing immunity, they have to test everyone every few days to look for asymptomatic cases."
5006,"Which the CDC did and released on 3-29 for a group of healthcare workers, but it wasn't a huge study, and didn't cover J&amp;J."
5007,The data was a mix of the mRNA vaccines but showed 90% reduction in infection.
5008,"And that's amazing, but still not 100%."
5009,"Ah, I see the pandemic denialists have arrived"
5010,"Certainly, but the government is much more responsible than the lack of infrastructure."
5011,"Two is obviously better than one, yes."
5012,"I'm interested in data on whether getting one shot of a two shot vaccine is better than zero shots, if you know you're not going to be able to get the second shot and the j&amp;j is unavailable."
5013,"A friend of mine is in the USA for 6 days, and will be returning to Ireland after that for the next year, where the vaccine is unavailable."
5014,"They can get their first shot of a two shot vaccine this week, but will not be able to get the second shot."
5015,They have no way to get a Johnson &amp; Johnson single dose shot before the return flight.
5016,"I don't know why, but I had trouble understanding this posts title."
5017,"In case any one else is confused,, ""shift work"" is referring to jobs that people do in rotation or on schedule."
5018,e.g.
5019,nurses and fire fighters.
5020,The article tries to justify the claim that people with those kinds of jobs get covid.
5021,Not everyone vaccinated gets immunity though.
5022,Reopening too quickly might be a death sentence for some them (immunodepressed or just unlucky).
5023,Because no vaccine is 100%.
5024,And there is the fact of lower efficacy for some of the variants even with vaccines.
5025,"Amount all vaccinated people, the chances of catching it go very low."
5026,Among mixed company it goes up (on average).
5027,No surprise here
5028,Here's what I mean by the welding thing.
5029,"[https://www.lbc.co.uk/news/coronavirus-residents-welded-inside-their-own-home/](https://www.lbc.co.uk/news/coronavirus-residents-welded-inside-their-own-home/)

As for NZ and AUS they aren't currently in lockdown, but there have been a few cases where they did go into a short lockdown over a few cases."
5030,Here's one example of that.
5031,[https://www.npr.org/2021/02/12/967229786/australian-open-bans-spectators-as-state-enters-5-day-lockdown](https://www.npr.org/2021/02/12/967229786/australian-open-bans-spectators-as-state-enters-5-day-lockdown)
5032,"It can be both, no?"
5033,German newspaper with 'data' from German politicians.
5034,AZ in the UK hasn't tried to send out any vaccines that have been stopped by the UK and stolen for their own purposes.
5035,Trying to say they are the same is nuts.
5036,UK doesn't have an export ban at all any way.
5037,"The EU is welcome to open up a vaccine production plant and use that in the UK if it wanted, the UK wouldn't block any going to the EU."
5038,It's still a few weeks before everyone who wants one has full access plus the 6 weeks to full immunity.
5039,Many urban areas ares still running on shirt supply.
5040,India was undercounting cases in the first wave.
5041,There's sero surveys implying the same.
5042,Mostly because many cases were mild/asymptomatic and people didn't want to get tested.
5043,But it wasn't hiding deaths.
5044,"Hospitals weren't overwhelmed, people weren't dying of respiratory distress."
5045,This variant is super aggressive and that's one of the reasons why India is overwhelmed right now.
5046,Because you still have restrictions and use masks.
5047,If you want to fully reopen 50% may turn out not to be enough.
5048,"Remember that herd immunity depends on R. When you reopen R rises, percentage required for herd immunity rises too."
5049,And even if you get to zero while keeping the restrictions you will quickly import new cases from abroad.
5050,"Brazil started vaccination of elderly in February, you know right?"
5051,"This week it will finish vaccination of elderly, actually."
5052,[deleted]
5053,There is a massive shot shortage.
5054,Some friends aren't getting slots until July!
5055,None of the vaccines are 100%.
5056,So it's safer to still wear a mask in a less safe situation.
5057,"Once/if we reach herd immunity, then we won't need masks."
5058,Of course that needs to be an average of herd immunity everywhere  and not just nationwide -- like of you jave 80% urban but only 40% rural.
5059,[removed]
5060,"&gt;If they suddenly said that you don't have to wear a mask if you're vaccinated, you'll get a whole bunch of people saying that they're vaccinated and that it's against their personal freedoms to request proof."
5061,And then they'd die and have only themselves to blame.
5062,How is this a problem?
5063,"It doesn't, technically, because you've got to focus on killing one particular group in your society and COVID-19 doesn't care if you're a Hindu or a Muslim."
5064,And both are dying in droves.
5065,The UK allows exports as well.
5066,The EU is very welcome to open up a vaccine processing plant and the UK won't do a thing to stop it sending vaccines to the EU.
5067,Because laws enforce restrictions?
5068,"&gt;Alot of the countries that did well had a majority of citizens who didn't actively try killing themselves and loved ones by going outside and trying to live normally

Yeah, those dumb-ass Hungarians!"

5071,The EU has been nothing but a pain in the arse with it's vaccine nationalism.
5072,"Deaths are underreported by at least a factor of 5, and I wouldn't be suprised if its much much higher."
5073,"Of course, everyone in a risk group is covered by law by every insurance in Germany."
5074,And almost every insurance covers it anyway for everybody with very few exceptions.
5075,But it is true that supply was scarce last year.
5076,I wanted to get vaccinated in october but had to wait 4 weeks until they got new supply.
5077,Sure but the decision to not take the vaccine is to accept the possibility of hospitalization with Covid.
5078,"The chances are very low for healthy young people (and these *tend* to be the type to skip on the vaccine, at least for now)."
5079,"I agree, I'm in favor of giving it like a month since walk-ins just opened in my area last week."
5080,This gives people a few weeks to get their shot and to build up immunity.
5081,"However, after that point, I absolutely refuse to comply with requirements just to protect the unvaccinated."
5082,"Especially with such effective vaccines and dwindling cases, it's really starting to seem counterintuitive with having these restrictions."
5083,A virus so bad they have to bribe people to take the vaccine...
5084,Curious though- is less than 40% of the population of the type that will refuse to get vaccinated?
5085,"It's not underreported due to lack of infrastructure, it's underreported because the government is actively trying to hide the numbers."
5086,"They are banning people from social media, intemidate journalists and even arrest people for asking for oxygen."
5087,Just note that this chart want made by the CDC itself.
5088,So it's whomever made the chart that left it off.
5089,The CDC says so.
5090,"Just remember it's low risk, not no risk."
5091,Just like safer sex.
5092,The vaccines aren't 100%.
5093,Remember when the CDC and surgeon general explicitly told us not to wear masks and said that wearing masks would do more harm than good?
5094,I was thinking future pandemics.
5095,The vaccines don‚Äôt work that fast in a day while the day before that was a huge increase.
5096,This just seems like propaganda
5097,Welcome to Team Moderna!
5098,why do u care man just do whatever you need to do?
5099,"They just put a ""not applicable"" on the left hand side."
5100,Tbey willingly left out important interactions that are literally spelled out by the CDC.
5101,Nope.
5102,"Even if the government suppressed data, it can't hide dead bodies."
5103,"Hospitals weren't overwhelmed in the first wave, people weren't dropping like flies."
5104,This variant is genuinely worse and is the reason why India is in such a bad shape.

5151,Good news.
5152,I know they have started vaccinating in my dad's small home city.
5153,That would be great if it came to pass.
5154,I certainly don't wanna keep wearing masks indoors even through the summer.
5155,Walked into the bank with a mask on and took out $10k.
5156,Pandemics been weird
5157,I had the same experience but am in perimenopause so I can't definitely say it was the vaccine.
5158,But the cycle after my second vaccine was more irregular than my usual perimenopausal level of irregular.
5159,Ignore them.
5160,Those guys have zero idea what they're talking about.
5161,"&gt;Modeling studies suggest that adherence to prevention measures, such as wearing masks and physical distancing, will continue to be important in the context of vaccine implementation.77-83 In one study, complete relaxation of prevention measures prior to adequate vaccination coverage resulted in essentially no reductions in SARS-CoV-2 infections.77 However, preliminary data suggest that increasing vaccination rates may allow for the phasing out of some prevention measures as coverage increases 83 [CDC unpublished]."
5162,"Furthermore, there may be certain activities that can be performed after vaccination, such as nursing home visitationpdf iconexternal icon, as long as other prevention measures are maintained [CDC unpublished]."
5163,"&gt;In summary, prevention measures will continue to be important for all people, regardless of vaccination status, especially during this period of vaccine deployment."
5164,"However, as vaccination coverage increases, a balanced, stepwise approach to phasing out certain prevention measures in fully vaccinated people, ideally those that are the most disruptive to individuals and society, can be taken."
5165,&gt;How long vaccine protection lasts and how much vaccines protect against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants are still under investigation.
5166,"Until more is known and vaccination coverage increases, some prevention measures will continue to be necessary in some settings for all people, regardless of vaccination status."
5167,"Not here to debate the CDC's position, just sharing their rationale."
5168,"Actually, there's a good chance those kids WILL be able to have their vaccine soon."
5169,There's an article which implies that they will be ready in May.
5170,I wonder if they will be made mandatory for schools.
5171,I‚Äôm guessing they can‚Äôt make them mandatory for public schools while they still fall under emergency use authorization.
5172,If they were mandatory that certainly would get the numbers up.
5173,If primavera ain‚Äôt happening in June then who cares.
5174,The comparison would be to reducing cases (reproductive rate) by a similar amount via paying people to get vaccinated.
5175,An additional 20% of the unvaccinated population getting vaccinated would have a similar effect as a (...permanent...) lockdown.

5177,&gt; The only problem with that is the small amount of people with legit health complications who can't get the vaccine.

5442,"All of the tools required to eliminate covid have been available to democracies -as an example, the Australian state of Victoria eliminated (via a hard lockdown) a covid outbreak which was deeply embedded in the community and rapidly growing."

5560,&gt;BERLIN ‚Äî Germany‚Äôs domestic intelligence service said on Wednesday that it would surveil members of the increasingly aggressive coronavirus denier movement because they posed a risk of undermining the state.
5561,I'd argue it is at best poorly written.
5562,The way I interpret that is they will surveil  ALL members of the deniers movement.
5563,"When what I'd hope to see is that they will ""aggressive/violent"" members."
5564,There is a difference.
5565,I 100% agree they should surveil the hell out of violent extremists.

5571,No.
5572,"The intelligence service in question is the Verfassungsschutz or literally ""constitution protection""."
5573,The full name is: Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution.
5574,One of their main tasks is exactly this: Gathering intelligence on individuals or groups who/which are threatening the democratic order of Germany.
5575,"This is a central element of a ""defensive democracy"" (wehrhafte/streitbare Demokratie), which is the political system of Germany."
5576,This system was born out of the experience made during and after the Weimar Republic period.
5577,The democratic system of the Weimar Republic was too weak to protect the democratic liberties it provided against groups which incited hate and violence.
5578,"As a result, the defensive democracy is a system that enables public institutions to act against anti-constitunional individuals and groups - even before they actually commit crimes."
5579,So no.
5580,It's the opposite: Surveillance of anti democratic individuals and groups is a sign that the defensive democracy is alive and well.
5581,I saw an article on here a week or so ago about how Israel paid rabbis to push the vaccine.

5971,Yeah but also younger people have less neutralizing antibodies.

6056,Now that appointments are open to everyone over 16 things are (slowly) getting better but I'm guessing it will be end of June at the earliest before we can honestly say that everyone who wants vaccinated has had a chance here.

6145,Is it good news?
6146,The entire reason I got vaccinated was to protect my elderly parents and my girlfriend.
6147,If I die of covid so be it but I could never live with myself if I gave it to them and one of them died.
6148,yeah .. take a swab .. how does your brain not compute this?
6149,Its standard practice as are autopsies and postmortems

6176,"Adding on to some of the research others have replied with, they‚Äôre not useless but even when used efficiently they‚Äôre only sort of useful."
6177,"I mean if everyone had a fitted N95 that they wore and never took off and never had to be changed, that would be a different story."

6189,Spoilers...we won't have vaccine passports for the rest of our lives either.
6190,"You may already know this, but it‚Äôs worth mentioning."
6191,Putting covid patients in a prone position can help with breathing.
6192,Here‚Äôs a video showing how.
6193,https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=cCkHPYpwg2g
6194,I would say it depends on how much the virus is circulating where you are.
6195,"If there's still as much covid around as there is now (in the US, on average), being in large groups, indoors, close to one another without mask is still going to carry some risk."
6196,"The hope is that in a month or two, enough people will be vaccinated and the circulation of the virus will be so low that the combined probability P(being close to someone with COVID) x P( the virus breaks through the protection vaccine protection) is basically zero."
6197,So is your comment.
6198,You are treading into dangerous territory.
6199,"First it was the Europeans are lying, then it was the European rates are higher, then it was second doses will be absolutely fine."
6200,How many more mistakes does the MHRA have to make in this for you to not see that the prudent European approach is correct?
6201,"They‚Äôre not telling them to come home because they‚Äôre afraid they‚Äôll get the virus, they‚Äôre telling them to come home because if they do get it badly, they‚Äôre screwed, the health system is collapsing."
6202,"The Indian mutation is already here and spreading, very much like in the beginning of the pandemic when we thought the first cases came off of a cruise ship but had actually been spreading in the US for at least a month."
6203,What do you mean by IFR?
6204,?
6205,"I think no masks outdoors, but still required indoors."
6206,"My question is, wtf does that mean for the subway?"
6207,?
6208,[removed]
6209,And specialists' outpatient clinics mostly haven't even started yet.
6210,You realize I was making a joke about how it turned out to be worse than we realized.
6211,That chart lists 14 activities.
6212,2 don't require masks regardless of vaccination status.
6213,10 require masks regardless of vaccination status.
6214,Only 2 require masks if not vaccinated but don't require them if vaccinated.
6215,"JFC, what is the CDC trying to do here?"
6216,"If they're worried about herd immunity, then put an asterisk next to all of the ""vaccinated with mask"" icons with a footnote that says ""once we hit xx% vaccinated these no longer require masks""."
6217,"No, they don't ""need to pivot fast""."
6218,"The vaccine is optional and the risks and benefits are laid out before they give you the jab, along with an updated leaflet specifically detailing the rare chance of these types of clots and what to look out for."
6219,I don't think they'll change from the current guidance personally.
6220,After my first shot of moderna my throat feels scratchy and I have a slight cough.
6221,I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs my immune system acting up after the vaccine cause it feels similar to when I have really bad allergies or getting a mild cold.
6222,I‚Äôm kinda nervous about what it‚Äôs gonna be like after the second shot because I heard the side effects are worse.
6223,[removed]
6224,There is nothing in the CDC data claiming or suggesting that most or all flu cases are tested for and reported.
6225,I never claimed that none were.
6226,"Go ask any family or primary care physician, and suggest that they do a flu test for every suspected case, and they'll laugh in your face."
6227,They do a tiny fraction.
6228,"The reason for that is there is no advantage to knowing what respiratory virus is involved in an illness, because the treatment is identical for all of them (COVID is an exception, which is why we incessantly test for it)."
6229,"In fact, there are probably a great many deaths that are caused by flu every year that are instead reported as ""pneumonia of unknown origin,"" or just ""respiratory disease."""
6230,Pneumonia is not a disease; it's a symptom.
6231,[removed]
6232,"I don‚Äôt understand the purpose of sterilizing the place, as it has been shown that surfaces transmisson is extremely extremely rare."
6233,This seems more security theater than any real precaution
6234,"Yes, you'll be fine."
6235,Because if you do nothing you collapse the healthcare system like India at the moment.
6236,More people die overall when you run out of supplies.
6237,Where did you see I wrote that no one else should get the vaccine?!
6238,My comment is about that the vaccine are not so effective as it's claimed.
6239,"A healthy sportive 50 years old man, nonsmoker, without other comorbidities, fully vaccinated 4 months ago, now is on a ICU bad breathing through a mask."
6240,The Osterholm podcast has now claimed that B117 has an R0 similar to or higher than measles.
6241,Also claiming still the ‚Äúdarkest weeks are ahead for the pandemic in the US‚Äù and ‚Äúvaccines aren‚Äôt making an impact yet.‚Äù Someone legit needs to check up on him.
6242,"I think I misunderstood:

&gt; Number left to vaccinate if everyone with 1 dose gets their 2nd: 46,729

Is the number left to vaccinate to achieve 60%"
6243,&gt; to suddenly have started to care about me.
6244,"You misunderstood, government isn‚Äôt doing this out of the good of their hearts."
6245,"They‚Äôre doing this because they know society won‚Äôt function with Covid circulating, and that means people aren‚Äôt spending money."
6246,Yes.
6247,My doctor did both when you went in for symptoms.
6248,I thought they don't smell or taste like anything at all.
6249,Yeah neither trump nor Biden have enacted basic quarantine procedures.
6250,Just vax our way out but the virus mutates too fast.
6251,I‚Äôm disappointed to say the least.
6252,I was really wondering primarily about second doses actually.
6253,Do we have that data yet?
6254,I am guessing it is so so minimal
6255,Lol
6256,"I think a huge part of it was that the way the flu shot was always pitched was ""it'll protect you"" whereas covid was ""it'll protect other people."""
6257,Most people don't think the flu is very serious and so won't really bother with it.
6258,"Its not uncommon to have fever as a side effect after vaccination, and 37.4 is very mild."
6259,Do you know if you were in contact with someone who had COVID.
6260,"If not, keep monitoring symptoms and talk to your doctor if you notice any serious symptoms like fatigue or breathing issues"
6261,That's not science.
6262,"Besides, that's just your opinion."

6271,It was just not much to begin with.
6272,AZ just massively overpromised.
6273,But BNT/Pfizer are kinda saving our ass there.
6274,"Many people who feel the way you do would be open to hearing about scientific data, studies, and potential health benefits from their family doctor."
6275,A lot of people trust their doctor much more than they trust the government.
6276,"Some won't trust anyone, but we need some of the hesitant, not all."
6277,"I know, i just have a really bad memory, so when a normal person goes I read that from this source, from this guy who is qualified."
6278,"All I can do is go hey i did read a thing, from a guy, but I can't recall the details.."
6279,So i was going to print out some common debunks and then just start putting it on their car windshield when I pass by.
6280,That‚Äôs just not how vaccine science works.
6281,You can‚Äôt give people a vaccine that is almost just as likely to kill them as the disease itself.
6282,You may end up with people in certain age groups dead from the vaccine at similar rates than from coronavirus.
6283,That will cause public outcry and you will never get public trust back.
6284,You have to be prudent and evidence based and learn to pivot where necessary.
6285,Rates of Covid are suppressed and they will stay generally suppressed with minor lockdown measures and with 70% of the population having some protection.
6286,You can‚Äôt just rush through a vaccination programme and unnecessarily kill people just because you want to go back to normal quicker.
6287,It‚Äôs not like there aren‚Äôt safer options out there that we can procure.
6288,1.
6289,"No, it can't."
6290,That's not a thing.
6291,"Things that can change your DNA: eating, breathing polluted air, and walking around in the sun."
6292,2. mRNA vaccines have no virus.
6293,There is no shedding.
6294,The only time I've ever heard of shedding being a thing for any vaccine is finding traces of virus in feces.
6295,"So unless your family touches poop on the regular, they don't need to worry."
6296,3. Who are these tons of people?
6297,Are they talking about the blood clots?
6298,Car accidents kill more people.
6299,People also get killed by vending machines but we still use them.
6300,"If tons of people were dying from the vaccine, we would absolutely know about it."
6301,The US paused j&amp;j for a week bc 7 people got a rare blood clot; I think two died.
6302,"If it was tons, we would definitely know about it."
6303,Sorry about your family.
6304,Do they also talk about the vaccine having a microchip and 5G?
6305,Zur√ºck!

6314,"Bayfield/Ashland counties rely heavily on tourism (mostly related to boat-related things on Lake Superior, like the Apostle Islands and kayak tours of the sea caves, etc) so there is a big push to get people vaccinated so tourists will come back."
6315,"From studies, there was barely any change between test and placebo groups after just a few days."
6316,So ignore your vaccination and do what you would have done if you weren't vaccinated.
6317,Which I assume is to quarantine for a few days and watch out for symptoms.
6318,And then get tested after at least 4-5 days of exposure
6319,"You know children get shots and swabs for things all the time, right?"
6320,"Kids stick shit up their nose for fun too all the time, speaking as someone who has worked with young children."

6325,Yes
6326,There was an article about this.
6327,"Education, incentives etc"
6328,I initially disliked the change to strictly age based vaccine rollout but it‚Äôs pretty clear now that it‚Äôs worked extremely wel
6329,Are there multiple trials pursuing this?
6330,"How will she ever, ever surviiiiiive?"
6331,"About all of the stuff here where people say that somethings never going to reopen and then someone reply‚Äôs something about how it‚Äôs all going to go away soon we just have to wait a bit more: I sympathize with both sides, but the thing is that I also kinda disagree with both."
6332,"Of course things are gonna get back to normal, sooner rather than later, but man oh man there have not been nearly enough places saying anything kind of real goal for when they‚Äôre gonna go back to full normal."
6333,Like people have every right to feel optimistic but it‚Äôs the job of officials to tell us what it will take in order to remove all restrictions.
6334,"In fact, I think we need to look towards what restrictions there are justifications for in the first place."
6335,"I‚Äôm confident in this summer being normal, but if things were how they were supposed to be, we wouldn‚Äôt have to say when things would be most likely to open as governments would already have a set, attainable, realistic goal."
6336,"While the vaccines work extremely well, they're not 100%."
6337,"[This thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/n0u59z/fully_vaccinated_adults_65_and_older_are_94_less/) talks about how fully vaccinated adults are 94% less likely to be hospitalized than non-vaccinated adults in the same age group, meaning some will still end up in the hospital despite vaccination."
6338,"But also, not all adults have been fully vaccinated yet."
6339,"Some people can't be vaccinated, due to medical reasons."
6340,That's why we're trying to hit ~70% vaccination rate to establish herd immunity.
6341,"Since some of the population is hesitant to get vaccinated, we'll need to vaccinate a lot of kids to ever reach that number."
6342,"On top of that, while kids are largely unaffected by covid, they sometimes still get very sick and even die."
6343,I think the number is correct.
6344,"There are 46,729 who have not had any doses and need either 2 Moderna/Pfizer or JnJ."
6345,There are another \~270K who have had 1 shot but are waiting on their second.
6346,"The assumption is that most who have had 1 shot will get their 2nd, so they are considering the two buckets as separate."
6347,So a few people get breakthrough infections that you know of... no one else should get the vaccines?
6348,They don‚Äôt work?
6349,"So what as in, what is your point?"
6350,Sounds like some purely anecdotal crap to me.
6351,"Personally, I've been at the gym indoors 6 days a week since September and dancing and underground dance halls with no masks."
6352,Its not even their first vaccine
6353,I‚Äôm concerned that we have plenty of vaccines and still a ways to go but the curve is starting to flatten.
6354,"God, I hate this comment."
6355,There's literally 0 reason to think this or spread this misinformation.
6356,"From what I can tell, \*nothing\* is un-safe w.r.t COVID if:  
\- You are vaccinated  
\- You are not in a crowded setting  
\- You wear a mask if close to someone you think may not be vaccinated  


Even if the above is not true you might be ok."
6357,"But if it is, you are definitely safe from COVID"
6358,Yup they've been really good lately !
6359,It's a breath of fresh air for sure especially after the briefings that the last joke of an admin had.
6360,Unironically.. probably two more weeks at this point
6361,"""But it gets me free Windows updates for the rest of my life courtesy of Bill Gates and I can make 5G phone calls without even using my phone just by thinking of a number."
6362,"Totally outweighs those negatives."""
6363,"Seriously though, you can't reason with batshit crazy."
6364,So what?
6365,"Put yourself in the situation staying 10 days in an ICU bed, with a mask helping you to breath!"
6366,How could you be so ignorant?
6367,Giants.
6368,Both shitty though.
6369,"Try to buy oxygen if you can, yes - but don't take your dying relative to a crowded public place (which is *not* a hospital)."
6370,"That would accomplish absolutely nothing, and would only endanger everyone around you."
6371,"I get that the situation on the ground must be a complete horror show and people aren't thinking logically, but what they're doing is still a very terrible idea."
6372,"I've heard this repeated a lot, but the traditional flu is symptomatic, right?"
6373,"In the current climate how likely is someone to spread a flu, ie being obviously and openly sick around other people?"
6374,We know C19 can be transmitted asymptomatically.
6375,The C19 precautions most people take would absolutely strangle the flu from getting new hosts to infect.
6376,Yup flu cause more immune storms to stronger (younger) immune systems
6377,Twinsies also a vaccinated moron
6378,The reporting system for deaths in Brazil works pretty much well.
6379,States report independently and the excess deaths is no more than 10% of the those reported from Covid.

6463,"I'm willing to take that risk to not have to live in ""Covid times"" for eternity."
6464,I have to wonder about the relative efficacy of the one shot of J&amp;J vs one shot of Pfizer or Moderna.
6465,They were never tested at the same time and due to the emergence of variants between mRNA and J&amp;J trials you can't compare trial results.
6466,J&amp;J must have been wondering the same thing because they started another trial which used a second dose.
6467,Haven't heard anything about that trial yet.
6468,My suspicion is one shot of any of them is comparable and two shots of any of them is an improvement.
6469,I'm sure time will tell if I'm right.

I'm 2 weeks out from my second Moderna vaccination now and as far as I know I'm about as covered as I can get."
6471,The side effects were minor from the shot and it's a very nice feeling to  know that I'm now unlikely to die from Covid-19.
6472,Well there isn't a universal rule for what's considered elimination level.
6473,Let's compare Japan to some other well performing countries for some context.
6474,"Japan -  4600 cases/1M, 

Australia - 1,110 cases/1M, 

NZ - 522 cases/1M

China -  63 cases/1M, 

Vietnam - 30 cases/1M

6490,Why would you risk a vaccine that isn't fully FDA approved and has barely been out a year if there is no benefit?
6491,&gt; But 27% of Michigan adults say they will refuse to get the vaccine.
6492,The point of these defined timelines is to encourage these people to get it.
6493,"I‚Äôm just going to preface this by saying I‚Äôm not a COVID denier in any way, shape, or form."
6494,But does anyone else feel like this is hard to believe?
6495,Like you would think there would still be a few thousand cases of flu regardless of how many extra precautions we‚Äôve taken because of COVID.
6496,"You‚Äôre telling me that, even in areas where people aren‚Äôt really following COVID restrictions, there haven‚Äôt been any flu cases?"

6612,Is there a reason we must reach 70% vaccinated without taking covid infections into consideration for herd immunity?

7047,The flu shot has pretty poor efficacy.
7048,Your immune system sucks
7049,This kind of thing makes the modelling very hard.
7050,"R0 isn't really even well defined, since it's highly seasonal and varies by location."
7051,In the [January 2018 flu epidemic](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm) excess deaths increased quite quickly: 1795-&gt;3030-&gt;3978-&gt;8391 over a four-week period.
7052,Using a 5-day serial interval that gives an R(t) of about 1.45 for that period.
7053,"But before that period it was much lower, and afterwards it was back below 1."
7054,"So 1.5 might be a high point, but if it's not sustained through 6 months of ""winter"" then that 40 generations isn't going to get anywhere near a 10-million-fold increase in cases."
7055,"If it averages 1.06 then it would take ~7 years instead of 1 year to get ""back to normal"" (but at that point transfer from animal reservoirs would become a substantial accelerator)."
7056,R(t) is supposed to be somewhat above 1 in winter and somewhat below 1 in summer for a seasonal endemic disease.
7057,The biggest unknown is surely still how much immunity will wane from having a season without flu.

7600,I think it's pretty well established that successful mitigation of the virus is dependent on a few things working together.

7602,"Social distancing, masks, hand washing, and perhaps other prevention measures like surface cleaning
2."
7603,"Contact tracing
3."
7604,"Rapid and accurate testing
4."
7605,"Travel restrictions

This involves citizen cooperation, government intervention, and perhaps even private business cooperation."
7606,It's a massively complex problem from both a logistical and sociological standpoint.
7607,Was the government part mishandled from the start?
7608,Absolutely.
7609,Did citizens refuse to cooperate?
7610,"Also yes, and part of the blame certainly falls on the government there."
7611,"However, any one sentence answer of what happened is what could have been done different to prevent everything is painfully small-scoped."
7612,Because there were aspects of ‚Äúnormal‚Äù that were horrible.
7613,"Long commutes, sitting in traffic jams, carbon emissions, pointless office meetings and politics, forced uncomfortable family get togethers, people breathing and hovering over you at the checkout line."

7651,"Not really, it's getting worse exactly **because** websites keep clamping down on it."
7652,It's pushing people further and further into echo chambers and they never get exposed to anything else.
7653,"The biggest issue is that social media sites use algorithms to show people things that drive up time spent and clicks, which usually means more extreme/conspiratory content."
7654,"Then if they do ""ban"" something (which usually isn't an actual content ban) or attempt to deplatform someone they become a martyr and people get even more curious about what they're saying that could be so dangerous, and it drives up views."

7661,A study of fewer than 4000 healthcare workers.
7662,You are asking the CDC to make a recommendation based on a single study of fewer than 4000 healthcare workers.
7663,"That study points to a conclusion, and it may well be true, but holy shit dude."
7664,That's not how science works.
7665,There are two ways this pandemic will be remembered.
7666,"Either, 'we didn't do enough,' or 'we did too much.'"
7667,"There is no, 'we did exactly enough' especially with a virus that wasn't around two years ago."

7680,https://www.krqe.com/health/cdc-evidence-suggests-fully-vaccinated-people-do-not-transmit-covid-19/
7681,The reason is because people are officially over it here.
7682,"Most of the people who were careful aren‚Äôt anymore - they are either at least partially vaccinated or their parents are, and aren‚Äôt that worried about getting covid bc they are young."
7683,"Personally, I think this is dumb."
7684,I know of quite a few cases right now here and it‚Äôs all from private socializing
7685,‚ÄòSkepticism‚Äô among the ‚Äòfaithful‚Äô hmm... seems these people might actually be wired entirely backwards
7686,"Great question, as with all things there is never a 100% certainty."
7687,The vaccine is effective and important for everyone that can get it to get it but it is not 100% effective.
7688,Meaning there have already been several hundred cases in Michigan alone of fully vaccinate people contracting and testing positive with the virus.
7689,There is also the question as to how long the immunity will last.
7690,I have heard of reports of those that were infected with the virus itself and were regularly donating plasma no longer having any antibodies present in as little as 3-4 months time meaning they could be possibly reinfected.
7691,Now hopefully the vaccine is able to last a long while but chances are that there will already need to be a booster administered at some point in the near future as there is no way in heck there will be enough people vaccinated in time to fully stop the spread.
7692,The worry is also vaccine escape.
7693,The vaccine is completely dependent on a particular spike protein on the virus itself.
7694,There has been the first steps towards changing in such a way that a new strain could develop that our developed immunity against the original covid-19 would not recognize sort of like how there is an annual flu shot because influenza is constantly changing.
7695,So really it is all about not giving the virus any more opportunities then it already has been given to learn and adapt.
7696,And heck it is nice to see some of the other typical viral infections drop off with social distancing and mask usage.
7697,Whats the percentage of fully vaccinated people who get and transmit covid?
7698,&gt; It appears that immunity starts having an impact around day 4-7 after the first dose of the Pfizer or Moderna.
7699,Everything I have read is 14-21 days after.
7700,"Clinical studies show 14, but Israel real world showed 21."

The Monmouth University Poll was sponsored and conducted by the Monmouth University Polling
Institute from April 8 to 12, 2021 with a national random sample of 800 adults age 18 and older."
7770,"This 
includes 278 contacted by a live interviewer on a landline telephone and 522 contacted by a live 
interviewer on a cell phone, in English."
7771,"Telephone numbers were selected through a mix of random digit 
dialing and list-based sampling."
7772,"Landline respondents were selected with a modified Troldahl-Carter 
youngest adult household screen."
7773,"Monmouth is responsible for all aspects of the survey design, data 
weighting and analysis."
7774,"The full sample is weighted for region, age, education, gender and race based on 
US Census information (ACS 2018 one-year survey)."
7775,"Data collection support provided by Braun 
Research (field), Dynata (RDD sample), and Aristotle (list sample)."
7776,"For results based on this sample, one 
can say with 95% confidence that the error attributable to sampling has a maximum margin of plus or 
minus 3.5 percentage points (unadjusted for sample design)."
7777,"Sampling error can be larger for sub-groups 
(see table below)."
7778,"In addition to sampling error, one should bear in mind that question wording and 
practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of opinion polls."

7785,They are currently approving more massive festivals for 500k+ people.
7786,Reverse psychology?
7787,Do you mind if I ask what your main reason is for that decision?
7788,Well this is how I'm thinking about it.
7789,"Every adult became eligible on April 16, but obviously not everyone could get one that day."
7790,"For whatever reason, there may be people who have to wait a bit to get one."
7791,"I'll allow one month of grace period for all those who want a shot to get one, which I think is plenty generous."
7792,"&amp;nbsp;

So by the middle of May for the first dose."
7793,Then worst case they get Moderna and it's four weeks until their second dose then another two to full immunity.
7794,That lands us right at the beginning of July.
7795,"&amp;nbsp;

So as a simple matter of courtesy to those people I'm going to follow these mask guidelines through the end of June."
7796,"After that, I'll stop wearing one unless required."
7797,Enough of my life has been sacrificed to stopping the spread of Covid-19; I have to draw a line somewhere and July 1st seems as good a place as any.
7798,"&amp;nbsp;

But that's just my own calculation."
7799,Who knows when indoor spaces like stores and theaters will stop requiring masks as a matter of policy.
7800,"&amp;nbsp;

Also from now on when I get sick in the future, just like a cold or w/e, and I need to go to the store I'll probably put on a mask again as a courtesy."
7801,"I‚Äôve heard two weeks, but of course your doctor knows better."
7802,"As of right now there are two benefits vaccinated people have:

1."
7803,"Easier international travel (then again many people don‚Äôt travel internationally, plus most travel restrictions remain in place anyway.)"
7804,2.
7805,Not being afraid of catching COVID.

7808,Go live in your bubble
7809,Yes which is very useful for India where there's both poor rural and urban areas.
7810,US does too but I would say overall the average rural US clinic is better equipped than many smaller Indian clinics.
7811,"I‚Äôm actually curious, this isn‚Äôt sarcastic, but doesn‚Äôt the vaccine mean you no longer need a mask?"
7812,"I mean obviously wear one in public because I‚Äôm not an asshole, but like wouldn‚Äôt the gym be safe without one if fully vaccinated."

7831,"&gt;I think it's hard to argue that high vaccine use + high restrictions have not created a situation that dramatically reduced the spread of Covid

California had high restrictions going into the last peak, so hard to credit that."
7832,"Vaccination demand may have been high, but the percentage of the population that was vaccinated was big enough in Feb to drive down cases, though it probably is high enough now to keep it down."
7833,"Texas, which has a pretty similar case pattern to CA (peak in Jan, sharp decline through Feb), has had lower vaccine demand, and low restrictions."
7834,So there must be other variables affecting the case rate.
7835,&gt; How much longer should one stay mostly inside?
7836,"Starting in March-April 2020, it was safe to do normal things outside."
7837,"Once you get vaccinated, it's safe to do normal things inside."

8224,Sign me the hell up
8225,Bruh.
8226,How dare you.
8227,Most seniors are vaccinated now.
8228,The remaining unvaccinated people can go spread covid amongst themselves and probably won't make a dent in hospital capacity.
8229,Can't find any information about how long aerosols last in the air.
8230,I assume the mask can help mitigate risk as my first dose is still taking effect.

8235,"Vaccines are just about 100% effective at preventing death, and 90% effective at preventing infection."
8236,Driving to the vaccination site is far more dangerous than covid at this point.
8237,I‚Äôd rather wear a helmet than a mask.
8238,"Mind you, I‚Äôm 19."
8239,My chances of dying from covid were practically near nil anyways.
8240,Any sources on this?
8241,The problem with that statement is it gives the government the ability to do anything as long as they can say its in the interest of pubic health.
8242,Certainly you can see the issue with that?
8243,"In my eyes, the governments only purpose is to provide services that the people cannot provide for themselves."
8244,Keeping ourselves ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù does not fall into that realm.

8246,Pfizer is the only one authorized for 16-17.
8247,No.
8248,You should pay for it.
8249,Oh nah I‚Äôm chillin
8250,it‚Äôs also occurred to me that Covid will naturally become less of a thing over time because it is so much milder in the young.
8251,"The new young people who will be born from now forward will never have lived in a world without covid, and they will all either be vaccinated (approval for kids are already in the works) or catch the disease (possibly repeatedly) while they are young and less vulnerable to serious effects from it and thereby gain at least some degree of immunity to it."
8252,"The people who are alive today will all grow old and pass away over the coming decades, thereby removing the more vulnerable population (ie, older folks who are unvaccinated and/or reached an older age without ever having been infected)."
8253,"Along similar lines: is it possible that the existing coronaviruses that cause colds, if they were brand new and just newly sprung on us, would cause nasty effects in older people like covid does?"
8254,"(ie, if older people hadn‚Äôt already had exposure while they were less vulnerable?)"
8255,I‚Äôm so confused.
8256,What exactly are you expecting the general public to do to ‚Äúbetter the world‚Äù in terms of a global pandemic besides sitting their asses at home and not spreading the virus?
8257,Awh I guess someone is upset they can no longer justify their basement dwelling life soon.
8258,You‚Äôre obsessed with other people‚Äôs behavior that doesn‚Äôt effect you.
8259,Get a life lol
8260,That makes sense.

8273,Indian government refused to allow any outside vaccines to be approved yet.
8274,What?
8275,70% of San Francisco adults have gotten at least one dose.
8276,How can Detroit be at 20%?
8277,"Yeah, I was literally the first person to even comment on this and I was railed!"
8278,"As I understand it, this is based on the P1 (Manaus) variant, which has caused all the trouble in Brazil recently."
8279,"The P1 variant has some very important mutations in common with the South African variant, which has shown antibody evasion when tested against other vaccines (the results of the study on the Oxford/AZ vaccine were particularly troubling)."
8280,This could make it an extremely useful vaccine in the near future.
8281,What higher purpose does government have then protecting the freedom of life(not to be confused with lifestyle)?
8282,Right.
8283,But at $50 a pop I‚Äôm sure there would be people willing to lie about about their identity to double dip.
8284,That would seem reasonable in other outdoor environments.
8285,"I'm not convinced it works well in a theme park when, even with reduced capacity, there's tens of thousands of people walking around."
8286,Concert-like crowds with zero distancing can build up real quick.
8287,The part I don't get here is why only require masks for people 10 and older?
8288,What's the rationale there and why don't the parks provide one?
8289,Just went to a limited capacity Blue Jays game.
8290,They had people nannying everyone (who were outside and socially distanced) to wear masks the entire game.
8291,Seriously people... on the day the CDC changed the guidelines too.

8299,That data already exists
8300,I had commented about covaxin about a week ago and got downvoted a bunch.
8301,Tempted to track down that comment and add an edit.
8302,It's remarkable how much first dose shots have collapsed.
8303,"15 days ago we reached our 7-day moving average peak of 1,999,185 (never quite cracked 2M)."
8304,"We're down about 40% from that high water mark (compared to 20% in the headline ""doses administered"" number because of folks getting second doses)."
8305,The moving average is going to collapse next week as the second doses catch up with the declining first doses.
8306,At a minimum I'm hoping the long tail stays strong in the coming months.
8307,"i go in and out of buildings pretty often while walking, and it's more annoying to take off my earbuds, put on/take off a mask, than it is to just keep a mask on all the time."
8308,National registry flags people who have 1/2 doses based on name/DOB.
8309,"Well, gosh."
8310,Who would have thought that vaccines actually work?

8316,"If people want to wear masks to protect others, that should be a personal choice, not a government mandate."
8317,Triggering or offending somebody does not mean i sm intruding on somebodys freedoms.
8318,Our freedoms are absolute to the point where an amendment to the constitution needs to be passed to remove them.
8319,That was never done with covid.

8334,I have to say that it does seem like a good idea to vaccinate parents before the kids.
8335,Most will have been vaccinated themselves and won't think it as risky since we've had so much time built in.
8336,It'll be a relief for the whole family to be vaccinated.
8337,I'm also thinking child vaccinations are how we're going to hit 70%.
8338,I'd bet on getting to 75% overall at some point but not after the J&amp;J pause.
8339,It‚Äôs a huge list of stuff from Oxygen production and delivery to PPE and vaccine components.
8340,"This blurb also probably means that AZ production won‚Äôt be restarted here:

&gt;	Vaccine-Manufacturing Supplies:  The U.S. has re-directed its own order of Astra Zeneca manufacturing supplies to India."
8341,This will allow India to make over 20 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine.
8342,However you can still catch a mild case right?
8343,Wouldn't that also mean they can transmit the disease?
8344,Only the overly cautious are sensitive.
8345,"The rest of us are like, duh of course it isn‚Äôt necessary to wear a mask while walking down the sidewalk."
8346,"Transmission almost never happened outdoors and only in large, dense crowds of people when it did."
8347,The virus is respiratory not radioactive.
8348,Agreed.
8349,"We probably should be wearing masks a lot more to protect other peoples health, so you‚Äôre right."
8350,"No freedom is absolute, they all intrude on someone else in little ways."
8351,"I wear it for a minute at the window, as there is a sign asking customers to wear it to protect their workers."

8365,Got downvoted multiple times telling people they should wear masks before it became popular.
8366,I'm vaccinated.
8367,I'm taking the masks off.
8368,"CDC was wrong at the start, and in my opinion they're wrong again now."
8369,This is what the vaccine is for.
8370,Around 70% according to Vince Racaniello from his Q and A tonight on YouTube.
8371,"They've been setting up a mass vaccination site in the parking lot, no idea if they used it though."
8372,Source: I live here and drive by it pretty regularly
8373,I don't believe it.
8374,The study I had read said half of those in Delhi slums had antibodies and you have to assume that anyone living in better conditions had a lower exposure.
8375,Just half.
8376,That means half didn't have antibodies.
8377,Not to mention that not every city was hit as hard and probably didn't have numbers that high.
8378,There were plenty of unexposed people to spread to once the country stopped wearing masks and went about like normal.
8379,"Also, some people who were vaccinated probably were in the group that had covid."
8380,There's some overlap between the supposed 50% group and the 10% vaccinated
8381,Those 16-17 year olds don‚Äôt have 12-15 year old kids to vaccinate.
8382,The parents who belong to the higher vaccinated rate groups will make be the ones deciding to vaccinate those kids.
8383,You cant really attest to his intentions...  Thats pure speculation and does not take into account the fact that we live in a democracy and nothing is done unilaterally.

8392,That's the thing.
8393,All we need is vaccines if enough people take them.
8394,We could end all restrictions today and so long as we got up to 70-85% of the population across all states and regions vaccinated the virus will die out.
8395,"That's literally how herd immunity works (vaccine induced herd immunity, not ""let's get everyone sick"" herd immunity that just leaves a disease at a somewhat controlled level of endemic)."
8396,People who refuse vaccination are slowing down elimination *and* the end of COVID being a thing from a restrictions/masks/whatever else perspective.
8397,Yeah that would suck ... hardly anyone wears a mask outside here (except for walking to and from a store or restaurant and their car).
8398,Nobody walking in the neighborhood etc.
8399,I feel like where I live (Ohio) it‚Äôs always been no masks needed if outside and 6+ feet apart - the kids at school eat while 6 feet apart (outside if weather permitting!)
8400,Parents haven‚Äôt been wearing masks at the bus stop bc there‚Äôs 2-3 of us standing at least 6 feet apart.
8401,Now that sports are back for kids ... they have masks but aren‚Äôt really wearing them bc it‚Äôs outside.
8402,Things are definitely loosening up probably bc everyone around my area is getting vaccinated.

8426,"Off memory from last year, it took 10 days for a covid case to be bad enough to get admitted to a hospital and another 3 weeks until death."
8427,Add in a 5-6 week process to gain immunity from both vaccine doses.
8428,Everything lags behind at least 4-6 weeks.
8429,"They should have just kept it simple, limit the size of social gatherings, enforce mask wearing except when eating or doing strenuous exercise."
8430,People tend to interpret that they belong to the group that has less requirements.

8458,"I won‚Äôt speculate what the correct calculation would be, but a couple issues I noticed:

1."
8459,Using 19M instead of 11M as denominator.
8460,"Breakthrough casesby definition mean after being fully vaccinated, so 19M is absolutely not accurate since it includes partially vaxxed people."
8461,11M may not be an accurate ‚Äúfully vaxxed‚Äù number either as I suspect breakthrough cases go by the ‚Äúfully vaxxed X weeks after final dose‚Äù definition.
8462,2.
8463,"Even if you used the most accurate number of fully vaxxed ppl as the denominator, that number would be too large for the purposes of this calculation, because it doesn‚Äôt compensate for the fact that many people aren‚Äôt being exposed to Covid."
8464,\^ This.
8465,"The same applies to social distancing, which means events where that isn't possible would still be cancelled, regardless of vaccines."
8466,I also want to add to this that Masks may not be as helpful if you're vaccinated but plenty of people are still not.
8467,"I do agree with the sentiment around here that by the summer once everyone who wants a vaccine can get one, we should start rolling back more restrictions, BUT masks will still help right now."
8468,I believe that public health practices like what is currently recommended should still be recommended and encouraged for alittle longer as going back to pretending covid never existed means more spread and more chances for new strains.

8470,"I don't worry so much about supply, but about logistics!"
8471,"If it's every 12-18 months, and the first shots are pretty much spread over 6-9 months just for the adults (that's what it looks like in Belgium at least), it means covid vaccination all year round."
8472,"A lot of the vaccine spots have been set up in places which are currently unused because of the pandemic (sports arenas, event halls, office buildings, etc)."
8473,"How will that be organized once we're ""back to normal""?"
8474,I‚Äôm not computing here but vaccinated people are less likely to go to the hospital...but the fees for treatment are still gone.
8475,Only vaccines and tests are free now..which stills sucks if you do end up hospitalized because you could be in the ER for 2 weeks and rack up thousands of dollars in medical treatment.
8476,Do you need the government to tell you when to wipe your ass too?
8477,Most important part is the reduced chance of transmission.
8478,Not getting very sick protects one person.
8479,Not passing it on protects everyone.
8480,Pfizer and Moderna are over 90% in the real world.
8481,J&amp;J is 70%.
8482,"Not to mention we don't know how well certain variants evade (basically anything with the E484K mutation) the natural immunity response, but we do know the current vaccines are good enough to deal with those that theoretically can avoid natural immunity (a robust enough response to prevent severe COVID very likely)."
8483,"‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a private business.‚Äù

That‚Äôs why he/she is complaining about it, not busting in their front door and/or trying to make the government tell the business to let them in."
8484,If you are fully vaccinated your odds of winding up in the hospital are approximately 1/20 that of someone who wasn't vaccinated.
8485,"They 100% do ask if you‚Äôve been vaccinated, or if you‚Äôve had the virus and the dates of these."
8486,"They also ask a whole load of other questions alongside such as where you‚Äôve spent time in previous weeks/month, been indoors with other people etc."
8487,"Source being myself, as I‚Äôve been taking part in the study since it started."
8488,They probably just haven‚Äôt included this info in the data set for various reasons.

8506,Even the poorest in society now have a smartphone.
8507,"Tracfones are smartphones now, with a touch screen and everything."
8508,They've been that way since about 2017 I think.
8509,But you are completely right about the elderly.
8510,"If they're over 80, chances are either A. they probably don't have one, or B. they have one, BUT don't know how to work it enough that they would be able to download an app and bring up a pass on said app."
8511,"As a braves and padres fan, I agree with you completely."
8512,"I desperately want to go to a braves game, and had been eyeing the may 9 game as an option."
8513,"But after seeing how close together and unmasked the crowd has been this week and watching our vaccination numbers hovering near the bottom, I decided against it."
8514,Now I'm DEFINITELY not going.
8515,I really wish I was close enough to cali that I could go to a game at petco.
8516,The Cali teams seem to really have their shit together on this and I'm totally jealous.
8517,They're a fun team to watch.
8518,It's definitely the most competitive division in baseball this year with all the teams being contenders.
8519,I guess natural selection will start taking effect at the end of this year.
8520,"Can‚Äôt help with an answer to that question since I haven‚Äôt gotten mine yet, but with ANY injection, the key is to completely relax your arm, or at least your upper arm muscles."
8521,"Hurts WAY less, and you might not even feel it at all."
8522,"If you‚Äôre scared of needles, you probably inadvertently tense up, especially if you watch as they inject you."
8523,I used to be like that but now I look away and focus on relaxing my arm and I swear I never feel anything now whenever I get a shot.
8524,You take a bite and put your mask back on while you chew.
8525,For realz.
8526,That‚Äôs what they do on some airlines..
8527,Is it just me or is it near impossible to have a study with that level of specificity with all the exogenous factors that are contributing?
8528,Drama mama much?
8529,Both teams are bad
8530,The odds of any specific unvaccinated person getting covid in any given time period is also rather small.
8531,"Without looking at the infection rate per million unvaccinated people, the measurement of infected vaccinated people per million people is a meaningless number."
8532,what if they're never low enough because significant portion of population willingly decided not to get vaccinated?
8533,[removed]
8534,Eh it probably won‚Äôt make a huge difference.
8535,We haven‚Äôt seen any sporting events that turned into Petri dishes this year
8536,Be cool if the cubs could win a game tonight.
8537,[removed]
8538,Dialysis and immunosuppressed patients had their Pfizer shots within 21- 28 days and they have barely mounted an immune response.
8539,They are dropping like flies.
8540,We are exploring the need for a third booster or altogether different vaccine for this population.
8541,"Pfizer may be the most largely produced and used vaccine but in certain patient populations, its useless"
8542,"Shhhh, PA/Philly will take that as a personal challenge"
8543,"Yes, but not yet."
8544,"Georgia doesn't have enough people vaccinated to support this plan, nor is mask compliance good enough to think it might be safe."
8545,I love that.
8546,Thanks for sharing!
8547,"&gt;AZ, a pharma company not know for its vaccines

Yeah it really shows :/"
8548,"Also, what about unvaccinated people ""Attending a small, indoor gathering with fully vaccinated people from different households."""
8549,"For example, can fully vaccinated parents take their unvaccinated child over to fully vaccinated Grandma and Grandpa's house without requiring their unvaccinated child to wear a mask while indoors?"
8550,Thanks for being reasonable about it!
8551,Cuz we understand it better now
8552,How is this good?
8553,Georgia is no where near ready for this kind of step.
8554,"Yes, thank you."
8555,I'm a Georgian and a huge baseball fan.
8556,"I'd been looking at going to a game soon, now that I'm vaccinated."
8557,"But when they upped it to 50%, I saw too many people packed close together, mask less of course, for comfort."
8558,"I was thinking of going to the may 9 game, but now I will not be going."
8559,We are not ready.
8560,The state doesn't have sufficient vaccination numbers to support this.
8561,It is the wrong decision.
8562,[deleted]
8563,The association is totally fair.
8564,Numerous republican cultural leaders have been pushing anti-academic narratives on multiple fronts for years.
8565,These sentiments have coalesced and into the polling data on vaccine hesitancy we see at the time of writing.
8566,It is not a mere coincidence.
8567,"If republicans who believe in science don‚Äôt wish to be associated with anti-academic movements, the onus is on them to reform."
8568,Not for everyone else to put blinders on.
8569,"That's 100% true, we didn't invest enough in research and I think that you have the right to have the vaccine first as us citizen, i'm from EU and we don't have enough vaccine for everyone but not so few, I'm thinking more about poor countries... man they are dying and have no vaccine and no hospitals..."
8570,The only issue I have with that break down is comparing the worst flu deaths in recent history with no precaution taken to literally every precaution taken over the last year for covid and calling it a similar risk.
8571,I'd be curious to see how many from that age group died in the last 16 months from flu as compared to COVID.
8572,Otherwise your position here seems much more reasonable than the one I originally commented on.
8573,"Gotcha, thanks!"
8574,!
8575,&gt; 'Any' includes '1'.
8576,"I'm being provocative here, but there is a threshold of minimum usefulness."
8577,"You dodged the question as to how many we are talking about here, so I take you can't or don't want to answer it."
8578,"yes, that's true."
8579,"I don't know and from the news it seems EU is also not clear on that, that's another aspect of this legal battle and that is to have more clarity from Astra."
8580,The point is that the UK factories should be producing also for EU and they aren't.
8581,Of course it is.
8582,[removed]
8583,"Right, but even 19M isn‚Äôt the correct denominator to start with, because ‚Äúbreakthrough case‚Äù is defined by fully vaccinated."
8584,I suspect this means 2 weeks after final dose but at the very least it‚Äôs after the 2nd dose has been administered (if applicable).
8585,"Either way, this is great news."
8586,Do you have any sources on these cases you're talking about?
8587,Georgia must be doing something right.
8588,It depends on where you live.
8589,I've not seen a person in a store without a mask in a year.
8590,You're simply not going to be allowed in without one.
8591,So... take 3 and your immune?
8592,I‚Äôm a super Genius.
8593,I‚Äôll be expecting my noble prize soon.
8594,Or a 15 billion dollar prize.
8595,Would prefer the second one much more.
8596,Thanks
8597,"If you're young and consider yourself lower-risk, I wouldn't worry about trying to get the highest efficacy possible."
8598,"J&amp;J is plenty effective, and you'll reach full efficacy sooner with it, so I would go with that."
8599,"As more and more people get vaccinated, cases will continue to go down, so you'll also be less likely to come into contact with someone who has it too."
8600,It'll be interesting to see what the uptake will be.
8601,Currently at least in my state 16-17 yo are 30% vaccinated.
8602,"It's substantially lower than all other age groups, yet somehow it seems pretty decent considering these are underage kids."
8603,People don't wash their hands regardless of whether or not they have the vaccine.
8604,Go into a men's bathroom and see how many people wash their hands.
8605,I'll be surprised if half do
8606,Nope.
8607,There were other stories too.
8608,https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.aljazeera.com/amp/news/2021/4/20/49-passengers-on-india-hong-kong-flight-test-positive-for-covid
8609,Thanks for sharing!
8610,I followed her - talk about common sense based on data.
8611,Very interesting (and well done) presentation embedded in the article for those who are interested.
8612,"In short, the numbers for NM are as follows:

Number of eligible residents: 1,680,605

Full vaccination target number (@60%): 1,008,363

Number with at least 1 dose: 961,634

Fully vaccinated: 690,909

Number left to vaccinate if everyone with 1 dose gets their 2nd: 46,729

Should be easy!"
8613,Get it done New Mexico!
8614,[removed]
8615,That's why they are being sued
8616,Wow that‚Äôs a terrible headline then
8617,"Out of these options, which do you think would encourage people to get vaccinated and which do you think we're running with?"
8618,1.
8619,"""Get vaccinated so you can take off your mask and see your friends and family."""
8620,2.
8621,"""Get vaccinated and live your life again."""
8622,3.
8623,"""Get vaccinated, mask up, keep your distance""."
8624,Id get the mRNA personally.
8625,Doesn't matter.
8626,Doesn't hurt.
8627,Just get the shot ASAP.
8628,Curfews are counterproductive.
8629,"With one in place, you're just getting everyone to rushing out at the same time before it's enforced."
8630,So much for faith
8631,[deleted]
8632,Sometimes the solutions to global problems can be political.
8633,This should surprise nobody.
8634,Officials need to start counting on entire population not just adults or ‚Äúeligible.‚Äù People think YAY!
8635,Herd immunity!
8636,"But kids, who can‚Äôt get vaccinated, are 25% of the population."
8637,Difficult to get herd immunity when 1/4 of the population is zero percent vaccinated.
8638,Could it be allergies?
8639,That's the guidance for fully vaccinated people.
8640,"Well I tested positive for covid today anyway, so even if it is for me I got tremendously unlucky."
8641,I really wish I was joking.

8649,"Yeah, I can believe those idiots don‚Äôt realize they‚Äôre only 99.993% protected"
8650,Wisconsin a role model.
8651,"So basically if you‚Äôre vaccinated, still wear a a mask under almost all of the same circumstances that unvaccinated people do?"
8652,What‚Äôs the point of this?
8653,Lol
8654,"Or it would have been, if [Bill Gates hadn't prevented Oxford from making it open source.](https://khn.org/news/rather-than-give-away-its-covid-vaccine-oxford-makes-a-deal-with-drugmaker/)."
8655,"If not for that, then developing nations would already be creating vaccines on their own."
8656,Distressing.
8657,"In Arizona, the governor restricted municipalities from enforcing their own restricts."
8658,"AZ has the ""florida approach"" you are describing."
8659,"Now, go look at daily case counts from Arizona."
8660,They've stayed low despite being fully reopen for quite a while!
8661,"I think this happens because so many people have had COVID already that we're much closer to herd immunity than the official numbers suggest, so not everyone could get away with it."
8662,But could we afford to loosen some restrictions nationwide?
8663,Yes.
8664,And we are.
8665,Which is maddening because there‚Äôs been a lot of women on Reddit talking about how it‚Äôs effected their period.
8666,It absolutely effected mine.
8667,You‚Äôd think they‚Äôd be wearing masks while building pyres for COVID victims‚Ä¶
8668,that sucks lol but thankfully the numbers are still on your side for a rather low-intensity infection.
8669,But do you realise how little is being made in the UK?
8670,It would mean shipping some out only to have more shipped in?
8671,It doesnt make a lot of sense apart from scoring political points.
8672,The EU is behaving like we're some major manufacturer and we're not.
8673,"They want complete fulfillment of their order, which of course is deserved, but what would happen if we also sued for the same?"
8674,It would be a deadlock.
8675,"I think its fair if the EU block from EU made doses due to the shortfall, but not right to demand ours to complete their order when we also have a shortfall too."
8676,Yep this is what I think too.
8677,It‚Äôs essentially for keeping good order while the population gets vaccinated or until COVID starts to die down.
8678,"I‚Äôm in Michigan, so the worst of the pandemic in the US right now (though rapidly getting better, likely due to vaccination)."
8679,"I‚Äôm fully vaccinated and due to MI‚Äôs status I‚Äôm being somewhat careful, but even then I‚Äôm not too concerned."
8680,Is it possible I‚Äôll get COVID?
8681,"Sure, but it‚Äôs damn unlikely, and I‚Äôll almost certainly be fine if I get it now, and I almost certainly won‚Äôt inadvertently spread it."
8682,"All in all, I feel like I can mostly engage in normal life again."
8683,Sounds like some Los Alamos vaccine levels.
8684,I‚Äôm jealous here in Bernallilo.
8685,Seemed like we would never hit green but I‚Äôm happy with the new opening strategy.
8686,Oh okay that puts things more in perspective thanks.
8687,Where I'm from the situation is a bit more drastic.
8688,Viral vector used is an Adenovirus which is what causes the common cold.
8689,If the virus is still alive then the Russian manufacturing process failed to inactivate the virus beforehand or there‚Äôs a problem with the filtering processes.
8690,An expected response.
8691,Citation?
8692,"COVID definitely infects some animals, but multiple countries have ended COVID as an endemic disease (the hard way via lockdowns)."
8693,"Based on this, it seems like animal reservoirs are not a material source of transmission to humans."
8694,A developed country that has achieved herd immunity would probably not have issues with animal reservoirs.
8695,"At worst, it would be at plague-level background noise (like 5-10 cases a year)."
8696,"Well, it‚Äôs good they changed their recommendation to advocate masks, I‚Äôm not against the change, I‚Äôm against what happened before they changed."
8697,"I don‚Äôt think health professionals should‚Äôve been manipulating the public, so I don‚Äôt trust them for that reason."
8698,"If I thought they genuinely believed masks didn‚Äôt help at that time, I‚Äôd feel differently, but I think it was solely manipulation."
8699,Incredible!

8704,This is definitely where I was.
8705,Thanks for clarifying.
8706,Have you actually looked at the CDC guidelines?
8707,Because literally the only guidance for vaccinated people is to wear masks in some situations with  unvaccinated people or crowds.
8708,Gatherings between vaccinated people have been allowed for a couple of months now.
8709,"The UK‚Äôs restrictions are much closer to Canada‚Äôs than NC‚Äôs, their gathering cap is 15"
8710,Perfect excuse to invent some!
8711,In developed countries?
8712,What makes it impossible?
8713,Impossible is a strong word.
8714,Difficult because of ignorance?
8715,Perhaps.
8716,"Tie a $10,000 stimulus check to receiving the vaccine and you'd see how quickly we reach true herd immunity in the US."
8717,"Obviously that won't happen, if you agree that would get us there, now we're just negotiating on incentives of getting the vaccine (or distinctives of getting it)."
8718,Because reddit/CDC is insane and doesn't use common sense.

8726,Religion is generally afforded more protection against regulation than other stuff because of the First Amendment and related legislation.
8727,"If you want to get at the *why* behind that, it's because America is a fairly religious country."
8728,"That's changing quickly as more people either turn to agnosticism/atheism or just profess a relationship with a higher power that doesn't necessarily fit in a Christian/Islamic/Hindu/Buddhist/Taoist/Zoroastrian/etc box, but the laws that provide those protections were made a while ago."
8729,I'd get the vaccine if it meant I could stop wearing a damn mask.
8730,"There's always gonna be a risk if getting sick in public, get over it."
8731,"Probably a stupid question: 

If it takes ~2 weeks for the second vaccine to be fully effective, should you still be taking the same precautions as usual for 2 additional weeks (after the first 2 weeks), since it can take that long for COVID symptoms to appear (I think), and it's possible that you've contracted the virus during the first 2 weeks?"
8732,"If you think about it for like three seconds, you can see it's not that interesting given there's an infinite amount of time to develop myocarditis after the 2nd shot, but a finite amount of time after the first."
8733,Why news outlets still insist on trying to frame everything as a negative is beyond me.

8740,It‚Äôs sad
8741,No I am not talking about enforcement.
8742,I‚Äôm just wondering about the standard.
8743,Today almost everyone I saw had a mask.
8744,Children under 16 cannot get the vaccine.
8745,Some people with immune disorders cannot get the vaccine.
8746,Even with their masks in they are not 100% safe.
8747,You help keep them safe by wearing a mask.
8748,For them.
8749,I understand that and I agree to an extent.
8750,It's still too soon to open up activities like this to 100%.
8751,"If you think 100% of those people attending are going to be vaccinated or abiding by any mask policy (let alone having that policy enforced in any meaningful way), then that's naive."
8752,Of course we'll have to wait and see what happens.
8753,I'd be happy to be proven wrong because I want this pandemic over like the rest of y'all.
8754,"but they could have issued a recommendation for cloth masks for regular people and suggest that surgical masks/N95's be reserved for medical professionals...

instead, they tried to shame people or mislead by saying masks are counterproductive, makes you feel invincinble, aren't effective at all."
8755,I will go to Alaska in June to get the shot couse I've enough money to do it but it's unfair...
8756,"Thanks to the EU allowing exports, unlike others."
8757,Dude....thats so fucking complicated (obvious).
8758,Wearing a mask in some circumstances is *literally the only thing* that the CDC is asking of fully vaccinated people.
8759,"You‚Äôve lived through the last year, but the prospect of wearing a mask at a concert is too much to handle?"

8800,"It's been a month and a half since she's been in the hospital, and she's expected to pass away in the next couple days from severe lung damage caused by COVID-19."
8801,"I get your point, I would have liked if they had defined ""crowded,"" though."

8812,"Getting my first vaccine tomorrow, happy."
8813,I actually don't care if I still have to wear masks at events for a while longer until we get herd immunity and to protect teenagers/kids.

8826,"I believe it takes two weeks after the J&amp;J vaccine to reach full efficacy, and Modern/Pfizer reach full efficacy two weeks after their second shot."
8827,Don‚Äôt know if the EU has such medals to give‚Ä¶
8828,"I see your point, but I also think that ""uncrowded"" has been left completely undefined, and is a very loose term that is up for interpretation."
8829,"Further, I feel that people who are not vaccinated are going to take advantage of this, given that nobody is going to be stopping people and asking for proof of vaccination."
8830,"Ultimately, it doesn't make much of a difference in my eyes, as I live in a residential area of a major, Democratic-voting American city, and have been seeing about 10% of people wearing masks outside even before this."
8831,"I just think it emboldens people who weren't wearing masks outside, despite the fact that they are in a relatively highly populated residential area where you are constantly passing next to people."
8832,Seriously.
8833,How many Californians were fully vaccinated as of Jan 1st?
8834,That means the first dose last November...
8835,Did the UK have a moral right to Dutch made drug substance earlier this year when AZ should've been busy producing for the EU?
8836,"you can still potentially contract, carry and spread Covid even if you are vaccinated."
8837,Your immune system is just primed and ready for it.
8838,"Since the beginning of this your own personal mask has *never* been about protecting you, you wear your mask for others."
8839,"If you're vaccinated and contract Covid you're likely fine and probably won't even have symptoms, but you can still spread it to people who won't be fine."
8840,So you keep wearing masks until transmission levels are very low
8841,[removed]
8842,Because people lie their asses off so they‚Äôll just say they‚Äôve been vaccinated
8843,[removed]
8844,Canada‚Äôs guidance is even more cautious than the US.

8847,Don‚Äôt do that!‚Äù like the squirrel Marge Simpson.
8848,Fuck that shit.
8849,Vaccinated people shouldn't have to wear masks anymore.
8850,"Would you also support insurers penalizing overweight people, who had significantly increased odds of having severe COVID?"
8851,"Maybe giving Medicare the option to refuse coverage for overweight-related care, as long as weight was in the patient's control?"
8852,I am not in favor of any of this.
8853,"If you don't feel safe, stay home."
8854,Let everyone else assess their own risk and precautions.
8855,Exact opposite here in NYC.
8856,I don't wear a mask walking around outside and will sometimes get hounded about why I don't have a mask on.
8857,The sad reality is there are two sides of the spectrum.
8858,You get bullied to take ur mask off I get bullied to put one on.
8859,I'm thinking summer.
8860,"The CDC keeps slowly lifting restrictions, and Biden said early that the 4th of July will be our independence from the virus."
8861,I think things will be effectively back to normal by then.
8862,Pretty sure at one point Fauci said he expects the NFL to have full stadiums by opening game.
8863,"Where I live we have about 850k people and are adding about 30 cases a day, it‚Äôs not that bad up here"
8864,From outside it looks like shambles.
8865,EU wants it the countries who get it don't want it.
8866,Looks like poor communication or bureaucratic processes just causing this mess.
8867,If Germany had gone on its own the entire Europe would have been vaccinated by now.
8868,[removed]
8869,Exactly
8870,What exactly does full efficacy mean
8871,"In a short time period, it is."
8872,And California doesn't have many cases right now even among unvaccinated people.
8873,"1,800/day out of almost 40 million people."
8874,[removed]
8875,"No, contagious disease means that your actions and the risks you take can affect people around you that did not choose to take those risks."
8876,That's why a contagious disease like covid is a public health issue and why the government's involvement in closing things down is warranted.
8877,"That's not how it has always worked, as we haven't always understood disease as we do today."
8878,"But for many years, and definitely the past year +, it has worked that way."
8879,People on this sub are incapable of telling apart medical advice from political decisions.
8880,Horseshoe theory.
8881,You think the ends are completely opposite but they are actually the closest to each other.
8882,I disagree.
8883,"I think there are people here who have sacrificed for over a year, have gotten vaccinated, and rightfully looking to have some positive changes."
8884,I‚Äôm not saying anyone shouldn‚Äôt get vaccinated.
8885,Just that we don‚Äôt have any firm evidence that natural immunity is short lived.
8886,An ~80% efficacy is better than what some ‚Äúfully vaccinated‚Äù people have.
8887,A 95% efficacy is obviously better though and people who have had COVID should be encouraged to get vaccinated.
8888,Well...no.
8889,"If you would look at the chart, you can see that the two sides are not the same."
8890,Family friend had a heart transplant and after the vaccine the doctors said it looked like he never got a vaccine.
8891,This is why it is so important to get vaccinated.
8892,To protect the people who are not able to or won't be able to fight it off.
8893,"That is not what scientist saying about Sputnik V, is this reliable?"
8894,Because it means they either lying or they have developed a whole new way of fighting the virus.
8895,I really hope so I'm 14 and I really want it lol.
8896,[removed]
8897,"From the national numbers, the breakthrough had about a 1% fatality rate, so not so different than unvaccinated cases."
8898,"However, that doesn't tell the entire story because 1) people who have been vaccinated would be more at risk than the overall population, and 2) there could be something about people that cause BOTH breakthrough cases AND a high rate of death."
8899,"Mid 30s here, no side effects besides a sore arm on dose 1 &amp; 2 for Moderna."
8900,[removed]
8901,"Now picture the reverse, a year ago, of saying ""young and low BMI can leave a mask off and do anything they want, elderly or overweight need a mask and distancing""."
8902,"It's hard to support a statement like that, so we all masked up and quarantined for a year."
8903,"It's time to let all of us go out, vaccinated or not, taking whatever precautions we are comfortable with."
8904,And here Boston is pushing reopening to 8/22 ü§¶üèº

8906,"Well I never experienced it either, nor anybody I know so maybe you are in the wrong?"
8907,Or its just not as bad as you make it out to be?
8908,"Seven day average is 583260, and will probably go down again over the weekend."
8909,"Some official data is available here: https://impfdashboard.de/

500k per day isn't bad, but 1m average would be a lot better to get through this fast."
8910,I hope all the promises for increased deliveries will hold true.
8911,"This is hilarious projection considering the [U.S. Department of HHS Annual Report for 2020](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/2020-annual-report.pdf) proudly states on page 48 that:
&gt; OGA coordinated  with other U.S. government agencies to strengthen diplomatic ties and offer technical and humanitarian assistance to dissuade countries in the region from accepting aid from these ill-intentioned states."
8912,"Examples include using OGA‚Äôs Health Attach√© office to persuade Brazil to reject the Russian COVID-19 vaccine, and offering CDC technical assistance in lieu of Panama accepting an offer of Cuban doctors."
8913,We all know how COVID is going in Brazil.
8914,"Western countries shamelessly spread misinformation about non-Western vaccines then you have highly up-voted comments in this very thread blabbing about ""live adenovirus found in Sputnik"" when [Anvisa hasn't actually tested for the presence of live adenovirus](https://super.abril.com.br/blog/bruno-garattoni/anvisa-nao-testou-a-presenca-de-replicantes-virais-na-vacina-sputnik/) and just needs to justify the promises they made to U.S. HHS that U.S. HHS brags about in their own public report."

8937,Why haven‚Äôt we been asked to wear masks between month 6 of our flu shot and our next shot 6 months after that?
8938,Flu shots are not 100% effective and start to wear off after 6 months.
8939,The messaging is shitty.
8940,"If you want to encourage more people to get vaccinated, tell them that once they do they won‚Äôt have to wear a mask outside and will be able to do more things maskless."

9114,"And here in the US, my brothers roommate for a heart attack, went to ER, and since his heart rate was ""normal"" (90) they just sent him home, even though he told them his usually resting heart rate is in the 60s (he runs marathons)."
9115,"After several hours at home, it didn't get lower so he went back."
9116,He had to wait for several hours before they got a scan... 3 of his arteries were partially and needed stents!
9117,He could've died.
9118,"(at the time of the attack, he was in extremely good physical condition, ran marathons, but before that he was obese)."
9119,Privatized health care doesn't mean you get seen immediately...
9120,"They are not under surveillance for having a stupid opinion, but because they circulate death lists of politicians who voted for corona measures ..."
9121,[deleted]
9122,I agree.
9123,I'm confident that the issue is that neither the IOC or Japan want to cancel it.
9124,If Japan cancels it they will have to deal with the fallout from breach of contract and if the IOC cancels they will be liable for the same.
9125,"It's obvious, imo, that the IOC should cancel the event since it seems unfair to burden Japan with something that is outside their control."
9126,"Breakthrough can only occur if vaccinated and exposed to the virus, not all of those 11mil where exposed to the virus."
9127,This does not caclulate the breakthrough chance/rate.
9128,"It calculates how many fully vaccinated people got reinfeced, which is a kinda pointless number as it says nothing about the ""real"" chance to catch covid again."
9129,As it includes people that never had a chance to get reinfected and as such should not be used to scale this number.
9130,For this you would need to assess/estimate how many fully vaccinated people had contact and how many got reinfected.
9131,"Fever is definitely a typical second dose symptom and the actual temp will vary widely from person to person (as well as how you took the temperature, if you just woke up, how bundled up you are, etc, etc, etc,)."
9132,"If Tylenol is bringing it down and it doesn't get worse I think you're fine -- but I am also not even close to being a medical professional, so take all of that with a big grain of salt!"
9133,All this talk about how good the vaccines are and I'm just bummed out that I still can't get one yet.

9138,Any reason why Moderna generally isn‚Äôt even brought up as an option outside of the USA?
9139,Less supply?
9140,Wonderful news!
9141,Thanks for sharing!
9142,Cant compare them by efficacy though.

9145,[deleted]
9146,&gt; How the tables have turned.
9147,Is there any indication that AstraZeneca doesn't work on mutant strains?
9148,"Here here, take a downvote"
9149,Not enough for the CDC to issue guidelines based on it.
9150,"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html

Towards the bottom of that page, which is the most recent guidelines:

&gt;Early data show that the vaccines may help keep people from spreading COVID-19, but we are learning more as more people get vaccinated."
9151,"I agree with you, but they're not gonna make it part of their official guidance until there's more evidence."
9152,"I'm currently in China with the hopes that quarantine will drop to one week, the catch is you would need the synovac shot."
9153,Will probably get the syno shot then get the better one when we visit our family in the States.

9155,"Colleague told me her friend's 21 year old son died yesterday, had hypertension and was antivaccine."
9156,"Her other son, 25, same illness and same belief, is still intubated."
9157,Seems these stories will become even more common.
9158,This is a good sign that the gravity is changing on this issue.
9159,A week ago we saw media outlets dipping their toes with articles like maybe outdoor masking isn‚Äôt necessary.
9160,The fact that we‚Äôre seeing article written going even further is a good sign because it‚Äôs both going to influence the mainstream discourse on loosening restrictions and is a sign that people are starting to change their minds as vaccines start to turn the tide of covid.
9161,Something I‚Äôve been saying for months as people stress that restrictions will never end.
9162,"I‚Äôve said now for a while that we know vaccines work, as they increase, cases will drop and it will not only give politicains leeway to open up stuff but it will change the outlook of people worried about covid, variants, etc."
9163,"2 lakh = 200,000"
9164,Why did you have to roll the damn dice Jeff
9165,Is it true India is only counting the diagnosed cases of patients who die in the hospital?
9166,&gt;In Atlanta you can walk right into the Falcons stadium with no appointment and have a vaccine in 30 minutes.
9167,It‚Äôs been like that for like 3 weeks.
9168,Anybody that prioritized having a vaccine probably already has both shots by now.
9169,Me and multiple friends do.
9170,"Okay, and?"
9171,An unvaccinated idiot in Atlanta could start a transmission line which goes ***outside*** of Atlanta to a place where people have legitimately been unable to  get vaccinated.
9172,&gt;There is a reason that children are not receiving vaccines right now.
9173,Because it is so incredibly unlikely that they will be harmed from the virus that it doesn‚Äôt make logical sense.
9174,No.
9175,This is a lie.
9176,Children have not received the vaccine because it is not yet approved for use in children.
9177,&gt;An elderly person not having a vaccine when they could have gotten one months ago.
9178,I did not say an elderly unvaccinated person.
9179,I said an unvaccinated person ***OR*** a child ***OR*** an elderly person.
9180,"&gt;These scenarios you mention are extremely, extremely improbable."
9181,"No, they are not."
9182,"&gt;So much so that if we are going to take extra precautions for these unlikely scenarios, we might as well be walking around with rubber suits on so we don‚Äôt get struck by lightning."
9183,No.
9184,That is a preposterous and moronic comparison.
9185,This is not something that only happens to one out of a million people every year.
9186,"Got my second Moderna at noon today, I FEEL FUCKING NUTTIN!"
9187,"hopefully i don't get sick or anything, but i'd rather be sick for a day than worry about this fucking monster."
9188,mRNA crew!!!
9189,!
9190,I can‚Äôt seem to find even guesses of actual daily death estimates.
9191,Is the number going to be something crazy like 20m-40k deaths per day?
9192,"&gt;potentially mutate, and be worse and/or evolve into a vaccine resistant strain."
9193,This is a fair point.
9194,"Though to be honest, we're fucked if the virus mutates to a vaccine-resistant strain anyway, even if everyone in the US is vaccinated."
9195,There's billions of people in the world that won't have access to the vaccine for a very long time.
9196,Perhaps it would be smart to keep intercontinental travel restricted until other countries have the pandemic under control?
9197,In a couple years would be my guess to know the true death toll (or at least a close number) wouldn't be surprised if it turns out to be 10M+ worldwide
9198,"I mean, you wont die, but sure, there's no incentive at all"

9200,Automod killed my other comment because I said some bad words.
9201,"To reiterate, our Feghorn Leghorn governor never ceases to amaze me with the level of his ridiculousity."
9202,"Well, uh, it‚Äôs Detroit."
9203,A.
9204,You're using a different definition of the term model than I was.
9205,B.
9206,"The ""Israel model"" tells us that 50% and restrictions cause a solid drop."
9207,It doesn't tell us much about 50% with no restrictions.
9208,50% is not a magic number.
9209,The question is whether Rt is below 1.
9210,That is informed by many variables.
9211,"Some of it is vaccination rate, some of it is existing population immunity (from infection), some of it is seasonal factors, and some of it is existing restrictions."
9212,"We herald Israel as being a magic utopia where COVID died when they hit 50% of total population, but people forget that Israel has very robust restrictions."
9213,"When people say ""Israel is totally back to normal"" they completely neglect to mention it is back to normal *only for those with a green pass*."
9214,Life is back to normal for those with green passes because Israel is maintaining onerous restrictions on unvaccinated individuals.
9215,Indoor dining?
9216,"Nope, you need a green pass."
9217,Movie?
9218,Green pass.
9219,Indoor worship with more than 20 people?
9220,"Oops, you need a green pass."
9221,"I'm not going to pretend that this is enforced with 100% efficacy, but the point is that Israel is forcing ""early"" herd immunity by only allowing normalcy amongst vaccinated groups and not letting unvaccinated individuals mix with vaccinated ones in high risk environments."
9222,The US is not going to do this.
9223,"Yes sorry..I dont look at this all that much...but just based on your statement..your part of that nonsense group of thinking..so because this a few days old, I am not arguing...lets just both wait and see.."
9224,"So... basically, vaccinated folks get two more options than unvaccinated ones, if I read this correctly."
9225,"Somehow, I think folks were hoping for more."
9226,Me and essentially everyone in the Bay Area.
9227,Don't worry about what literal nobodies on twitter say about anything.
9228,If someone on twitter told me the sky was blue I'd go outside to double check.
9229,"Guidance for vaccinated people continues to be to wear masks in all indoor situations, and in crowded outdoor gatherings."
9230,That's fairly comprehensive for most folks.
9231,"Fair, I've always been confused by the ""what's in it for me?"""
9232,crowd.
9233,Most are suburban followed by urban and a shrinking amount rural
9234,"I would absolutely do it again if it means I don‚Äôt have to worry about killing someone else who has a lower chance from my exposure, despite my being careful."
9235,Your uncle was on a ventilator and you didn‚Äôt know about it?
9236,I think the average IQ in our country is going to rise just a little bit by the end of this.

9238,A virus so deadly you have to get tested non stop to tell if you have it..
9239,Thank you for your hard work during this time.
9240,The most interesting test will be the recent UFC event in Jacksonville.
9241,"Full sold-out capacity, indoors, no masks required."
9242,Does anyone know what's the best antibody test I can get in US?
9243,I had a lot of exposure lately to Covid and I got tested negative today.
9244,I believe I could be one of those asymptomatic covid patient who developed antibodies sometime in the past 1 or 2 months (I had 100.3 fever for few hours few months back and didn't get tested).
9245,I can only imagine the relief of seeing some sort of turning of the tide first hand.
9246,Had a family member die from it last year who was in the same age group and category you described.
9247,Literally went from admittance walking on his own to death in 12 hours.

9259,We will get that 50% total population mark.

9262,We will start to see j&amp;j one shots being available at sporting event/concert venues and states will find other unique ways to drive up the numbers.
9263,"Right now, life is the same for vaccinated vs unvaccinated (I know that isn't entirely true, but from a restrictions standpoint), we haven't hit stuff like NFL season where teams like the Bills are requiring vaccination to attend."

9288,So?
9289,It‚Äôs better ain‚Äôt it?
9290,Exactly.
9291,"A lot of people listen to the CDC as gospel, especially in times like this, and for good reason."
9292,If the CDC said that mask wearing could be relaxed when vaccinated and emphasized how effective these vaccines actually are I promise you the amount of vaccination numbers would skyrocket
9293,Yes
9294,But that‚Äôs not how you calculate efficacy you nitwit.
9295,"If there‚Äôs a disease that kills 1 in 10k, and the treatment stops it, then the only efficacy change by your calculations is 0.0001."
9296,Lol you need to compare the two groups
9297,What a stupid set of guidelines.
9298,If you are depending on a government bureaucrat to tell you that you can visit friends and family without a mask or eat outside at a restaurant without a mask you are beyond help!
9299,At what level of baseline risk are we going to allow things to go back to normal?
9300,"It's like modern science works, who knew?"
9301,"A source close to the family posted in the Alberta Reddit on this story that she was found to have a blood clot in her lungs, supposedly still no association with COVID."
9302,&gt; who in hell was ever actually wearing a mask when jogging or walking outside by themselves???
9303,I did.
9304,"If you are running on the sidewalk and someone is coming towards you, it's not much use to put on a mask once you see them - they'll still end up walking into a cloud of your old *droplets*."
9305,It was mostly a courtesy thing since I live in a neighborhood with a decent number of elderly people.
9306,The point is more so that these particular vaccines work really well
9307,That‚Äôs not how efficacy works at all.
9308,Lol you need to compare to unvaccinated poeple.
9309,the 80% study was the outlier.
9310,Thank you.
9311,In this context I was referring to how the people's interest have changed.
9312,We'll there haven't been any official news about whether AZ works on the new variant or not.
9313,Since 90% of the shots administered in India was AZ and since they're not dying to the new variant I guess it is effective against the new variant.
9314,I came here looking for this type of first hand knowledge.
9315,Thank you!
9316,Er only 90% effective
9317,My 20 year old daughter had the same symptoms 2 weeks ago and tested negative.
9318,She‚Äôs been fully vaccinated for over a month.
9319,I thought for sure it was COVID as I had it last March and the symptoms were all too familiar.
9320,Dr prescribed her ZPak and antihistamine and it cleared up.
9321,Paywall.
9322,"Okay take it at face value then:

- 1-2% fatality rate - assuming you are infected
- 95% effective vaccine
- that alone means the average chance of a vaccinated person dying from the disease is 0.0005% (2% * 1-95%)
- the above assumes you have a 100% chance of effective exposure to the virus (we know it‚Äôs less than that bc not everyone in the U.S has been infected)
- chance of exposure goes down dramatically once most people get vaccinated."
9323,Even the 1/20 vaccinated that get infected are way less likely to spread it to others bc they are vaccinated.
9324,So right now we have: 0.0005% chance of death of a vaccinated person is exposed to COVID (which is less than normal flu).
9325,And also a much lower infection rate.
9326,I get mine on the 9th too!
9327,According to scientists like Dr. Crotty it's literally multiple times more antibodies/immune response.
9328,"Basically, they should be the most immune out there for a while."
9329,I have borderline hypertension and am a lot older.
9330,So glad I got Vaccinated.

9339,What has public drinking to do with anything?
9340,Yeah sure nothing is free.
9341,It is paid for by taxes.
9342,Why should this be more expensive in the long run.
9343,German health care costs are about half of the US health care costs.
9344,Is this as a result of a new president and new leadership?
9345,I'm not in America so don't hate on me if that's a stupid question.
9346,I'm genuinely curious to know if Biden is trying to fix the corona virus situation there.
9347,Japan is incapable of doing anything quickly....you are thinking of a Japan that has long since stagnated away.
9348,"This is fine, but just make sure that all the while you direct your anger at the people not getting vaccinated, and not at public health officials who are attempting to save lives."
9349,They don't have the choice of saying it's too fucking bad for those idiots and those caught in the crossfire.
9350,It's their professional obligation not to say that.
9351,It's your perogatice to ignore them.

9353,This is extremely cynical but part of me is starting to think that the slow rollout is a deliberate part of Japan's brinkmanship with the IOC.

9355,It would've been nice if Trump had taken his vaccination in public instead of sneaking it when no one was aware.
9356,"The one good thing he did during this pandemic was investing in vaccine development, but instead of praising its effectiveness and showing people it worked for him without ill effects, his followers are left with wild conspiracy theories again."
9357,Japan's government is seriously less competent than most third-world countries.
9358,They've spent all their energy on insisting that the Olympics will happen and basically none on planning distribution.
9359,"The modern Japanese approach to any problem is to freeze in place and hope it goes away, before beginning to take the actions they should have taken a year ago."
9360,And then the actions should be taken as cautiously and carefully as is humanly possible.
9361,"We won't get vaccinated until late 2022, count on it."
9362,Source for 28000.
9363,"According to world Bank, India's death rate is 7.3 per 1000 in 2019. https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.CDRT.IN?locations=IN

9369,"The basic pension system is not intended to stand on it's own, the ""2nd highest tax burden worldwide"" is a BS attempt at basic math, being able to have a drink in public is basic freedom and I'd prefer German smoking rates over US child mortality rates any given day."
9370,"Plus, you've very obviously never tried to have an accident or any random illness in both countries."

9463,"Not if the purpose is a ""Death List""!"
9464,Death threats are most definitely illegal.
9465,"Yeah this is all BS, people keep trying to read something into the side effects, like it means you have a strong/weak immune system, you were/weren't already exposed, etc."
9466,There doesn't seem to be any correlation.
9467,I'm in rural Western MA and I rarely see people following it.
9468,Why is death the only metric people talk about with covid?
9469,"It's not a concern about death, it's about any long term implications that we aren't aware of."

9477,"Each day, the centers nearby to us have less of the two dose vaccines and more of the J &amp; J, which they refuse to take (typical boomers who get freaked out by news)."
9478,Sigh.
9479,I am so annoyed and worried because I have a feeling they will keep delaying it and not taking it.
9480,"Even my mom is like, what's the point if you have to get a booster?"
9481,It's exhausting because I feel like everyone has gone back to normal except for us.
9482,Yes I think so.
9483,"Israel started to report herd immunity having vaccinated 56%, and they counted 15% of people recovered."
9484,They closely tracked cases and recovered people so that 15% was pretty solid.
9485,It is not as closely tracked in the US.
9486,But you can't have these huge waves of cases like what happened in California without large numbers of those people becoming immune.
9487,Dr. Gottlieb estimated that 30% of the population had been exposed back in January.
9488,"Surely higher now, and let's say that half of those people have some immunity."
9489,"40-50% vaccination, 15-20% immunity... this I think is why cases are falling almost everywhere in the country."

9501,"I'm really glad I got the last shot, now I know for sure that I won't die because of it."
9502,It‚Äôs kind of backwards that the most successful state when it comes to vaccine numbers is the most hesitant to get back to normal.
9503,Massachusetts is going to hit herd immunity well before August.
9504,"That's allowed, surely - it's all public data, isn't it?"
9505,The RKI here also released and updated a paper that listed which businesses are more and which are less likely to have impact on the infection rates.
9506,Preety detailed stuff but the government certainly doesn't give a shit about it.
9507,They are quite literally handpicking advice that suits them best.
9508,"""We will listen to that, that, that oh but not to that no""."
9509,The paper lists public parks and outside ventures generally as places that absolutely don't have any impact on infection rates.
9510,"Yet we still have a curfew now, which means people won't go outside and instead meet illegally inside."
9511,Cinemas are also low risk according to them but the government quite literally ignores the data about this already.
9512,An entire branch of industry closed for a shocking half a year now and a shit ton of jobs lost or at risk to be lost because the government preety much doesn't give a shit.
9513,It's indoors so it's bad.
9514,So yea.
9515,That's why I am so skeptical about the governments reopening plan.
9516,I think the 7 day incidence is an awul way to determine which measures are needed.

9518,But everything rises and falls with it here.
9519,The Big Apple is back!
9520,Actually I don't think so.
9521,There are far more cases among 20-49 but 80%+ of age 65+ have been vaccinated.
9522,I think the older people have remained sequestered but it's the younger people who are getting it.
9523,Definitely some overlap but I don't think that much.
9524,Let's spy on people with ideas we dislike to find wrongdoing and establish reasonable suspicion.
9525,Hmmm.
9526,Did you write that while drooling on your keyboard or cellphone
9527,"Yes, because we all know the government follows the law, doesn't reinterpret it however it wants to justify what it wants to do, can't just change the law on the whim of a legislature, and that courts always uphold the law and never poke holes in it."

9545,"Have a nice day with your intrusive thoughts, you wonderful person :)"
9546,Looks like the number of shots might be higher than the shipment numbers.
9547,They're painstakingly sucking the last drops from the vial which means they're extracting 7 shots more often than 6.
9548,"If shipments continue with J&amp;J and AZ delivering almost nothing, 4 million shots per week are going to be the limit until June."
9549,"I bet if things were really bad, then they'd use 10+ shots from each vial because the concentration is said to be very high, a smaller amount would likely be just as good."
9550,"So I assume modifying existing covid vaccines is a much quicker process than making a new one from scratch so the variant boosters amd ones for kids will be easier to make, but won't these these new shots have to go through the smae process of trials and testing or is their am expedited process for modified vaccines that allows us to export them faster?"

9552,"There should have been a concerted vaccine drive, just like ""get out the vote""."
9553,"They needed a PR campaign, including an information campaign about the risks and benefits, videos of smiling celebrities getting the vaccine and giving a thumbs up, outreach to specific groups of people including those most likely to be reluctant, public events with live bands and your favorite public people, social media campaigns and ""vaccine influencers"", etc."
9554,Rainbows and unicorns.
9555,"Instead we got this very muddled stiff upper lip message of, get the vaccine, but remain locked down and don't travel, don't gather, keep wearing your mask, etc."
9556,Which I guess has some basis in science but is probably the least effective way to get people to get it and fuels people who were skeptical or reluctant.
9557,It is also a shame that it got so politicized so now you have half of the country who were deeply reluctant to begin with.
9558,I feel like they have to.
9559,"Deaths are already pretty much in the toilet tbf, there‚Äôs been one 20+ deaths day in the last two weeks, 7 day average is 11 deaths."

9561,"Tomorrow we will easily beat last week's number, so the average will continue to rise to &gt; 600k"

9598,"There‚Äôs a guy on here who does the rates and stuff for MA, and if we waited until 2 weeks after we hit 90% of the population with both shots, it would be July 9, 2021, nearly a month before the reopening."

9687,"The U.S. has been continually over 5 million active cases since Nov. 27, and likely can stay above that threshold for months."
9688,"Only India is anywhere close, and that is a very recent thing."
9689,"(Brazil is still over a million, but they only cleared that number on March 9, peaked at 1.5, and are dropping fast, looking to drop back below in a day or two.)"
9690,"By official count, India only seems to have cleared 1 million on April 9, though admittedly the height of the ceiling given the explosive trajectory, and the size and density of India's population is rather concerning."
9691,I think most people would also be hesitant to refuse a vaccine if flat out asked by their own doctor.
9692,The 'Querdenken' movement isn't simply people denying Covid.
9693,"It was founded based on that, but quickly merged together with preexisting right-extremist movements, voicing death threats to their opposition and illegally arming themselves."
9694,They capitalize on people rightfully/understandably fed up with pandemic measures and all and try to use and radicalize them.
9695,This feels like when the pandemic was first new
9696,&gt; only for those with a green pass.
9697,I see this term.

9705,Better him than a line cook!
9706,"I think this will probably be pulled forward, but glad to see that they are setting a firm date."

9719,But Europe actually completely crushed it over the summer to the point that we were at the same level as East Asia.
9720,But we didn't have strict enough border measures or the public health infrastructure to keep it that way and ended up having much worse second and third waves.
9721,Ireland managed to pretty much completely get rid of it and all of our new cases over the summer were from international travel which then grew exponentially.

9742,The Russian one does seem ok.
9743,But still not as good as the premier two usa vaccines.
9744,Confidence is going down because the effectiveness of these vaccines has been downplayed by public health officials and the media.
9745,The messaging is slowly getting more positive but all we heard for the last several months was: ‚Äúget vaccinated but your life still won‚Äôt go back to normal‚Äù.
9746,The message should have been: ‚Äúget vaccinated and your life can go back to normal two weeks after your second shot.‚Äù Or whatever the wait period is for J&amp;J.
9747,People respond to incentives and getting back to normal is the biggest incentive of them all.
9748,every time you catch a cold you're getting a shot of RNA.
9749,have we reached a philosophical watershed on that?

9756,Especially if we can maintain a decent vaccine uptake.
9757,Also other states like NY opening up will push him to do more which they already said about bars serving at the bar top

9785,We can all guess what it is going to happen based on what we learned from the internet but at the end of the day people should always trust their doctor more than the internet for medical advice.

10032,&gt; I was actually looking for this information to understand why crematoriums are overwhelmed.
10033,Can you provide a source?
10034,"Not a source, but to cremate a body takes *several hours* of work."
10035,It doesn't just up in flames and melts in two seconds.
10036,The flesh and bone have to be charred and broken down into almost nothing and then sifted or pounded into the fine ash you ultimately get.
10037,They burn one body at a time and try to painstakingly ensure they're scrubbed down between bodies and keep remains separate.
10038,Getting super tired of people spouting that the vaccines only prevent severe disease and do nothing to prevent infection.
10039,Headline is a bit misleading.
10040,"You can deny covid all you want, no crime here."
10041,But far right groups have tried to storm the Reichstag and that is not fun at all and at least worth having an eye on.
10042,"I mean if vaccines aren't enough for those people they will just wear a mask forever, because nothing else is coming."
10043,The vaccine is the final solution.
10044,That's incorrect.
10045,This sample size is far too small to draw conclusions from.
10046,Most likely there will be no audience it will be empty stadiums other than the athletes.
10047,I think less people go to their primary doctor less than we think.
10048,Especially the under 40 crowd.
10049,Too little too late waste of their time
10050,"&gt; they're trying to influence the population to get a desired outcome

yes because this is not ""crazy"" talk"
10051,"I wouldn‚Äôt chastise them for the fear, but remind them that it‚Äôs a split second and that they should make their fear known to the person who is injecting them."
10052,I didn‚Äôt even feel my shot.

10054,Bro during good Friday we had amish people fucking everywhere downtown in my city singing and handing out pamphlets about God.
10055,I guarentee they were either catching or spreading covid
10056,Population density is a huge driving force.
10057,"NJ, RI, and MA are the top three, and New York is 7th but obviously VERY concentrated in the NYC metro area."
10058,Reasons?!
10059,There's only ONE Reason...
10060,Politics.
10061,[https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2105000](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2105000)
10062,It's mostly not the result of the president.
10063,It's mostly the result of vaccines and the increasing pool of evidence that immunity whether from vaccine or natural is strong robust and long-lasting
10064,The EU did.
10065,Their were really not enough doses at all.
10066,Anyways German bureaucracy still sucks.
10067,It takes too long to set a proper plan up.
10068,"But ones it's up, it's a smooth ride (until something unordinary is happening)"
10069,My personal risk of COVID is zero also.
10070,"Jokes on them, plenty of Americans don't need any help to distrust those Bill Gates microchip implants."
10071,"Ehm - they are not persecuted, they are investigated."
10072,"Such a list, especially if they are titled ""death list"", in context with other violent acts done in the last year (including trying to ""storm"" the parliament and other death threats) are more than enough to warrant investigation using surveillance."
10073,"These methods are exactly there to, when there is sufficient starting suspicion, to investigate enough to warrant persecution."
10074,20% infected would be an IFR of nearly 1% which is a lot higher than current estimates.
10075,Really doesn't matter at this point.
10076,This show is over in Israel
10077, Except there's zero risk of Covid there.
10078,"Well, then its a good Thing that its not happening..."
10079,r/redditmoment
10080,"You can't really know though...My boyfriend is in quarantine for exposure, and local health department guidelines are that the kids and I can still go out and do essential things, unless he becomes symptomatic, but we should be masked at all times to do so."
10081,"Even outside, even alone, just to be on the safe side."
10082,"So, even though I feel it's a bit asinine (and I am 100% pro-mask), I do it because a) it is the direct instruction from the health authority, and b) I've gotten stupidly used to having it on, and it doesn't really bother me to wear it."
10083,"However, once he is out of quarantine, I won't be wearing the mask outside by myself."
10084,Definitely still will be if we are in crowds (indoor or out).
10085,"I think sometimes, we put them on before leaving the house and just don't realize we don't have to."
10086,Muscle memory and all.
10087,Yeah it‚Äôs weird lol.
10088,Weird that one of the most educated states is so hesitant to trust the efficacy of the vaccines
10089,They are ready for a partial reopening today That's really what it means.
10090,Expect things to be fully open by July 1
10091,[deleted]
10092,Put them under the jail instead
10093,This made me laugh
10094,Freedom of speech means something much weaker in Europe.
10095,"They ban symbols (swastika and other things in Germany), clothing (headscarves in France), denial of genocides (mostly the Holocaust but increasingly the Armenian genocide as well)."
10096,This kind of stuff is unthinkable in the US with the current interpretation of the 1st amendment.
10097,"I agree, I think they will"
10098,"We're also tops in Covid deaths per capita (top 4 states per Worldmeters: NJ, NY, MA, RI)."
10099,It's frustrating.
10100,It feels like we've tried to do everything right and have just been hammered over and over.

10102,Masks just outside in general.
10103,I'm from Ireland and we have one of the most cautious approaches in the world and even we don't wear them out.
10104,"But if you're in a large group or in a busy area, then there is much more of a reason to wear them."
10105,Neither does anyone with 2 doses have 100% immunity from infection.
10106,"And you demand a complete and complex study, delivered here on reddit?"
10107,"It is rather the other way around, that your claim for corruption and missing independence, need proove, because you claim that the system does not work as it is designed to work."
10108,"It is nearly impossible to prove that a system works as it meant, because you have to show every single case and every single situation, something that is nearly impossible."
10109,"On the other hand, to prove that it fails, you can produce clear evidence by showing the situations they fail."
10110,"For indicators, you can start with the [democracy index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index), where germany is on place 14 with an index of 8.82 of 10."
10111,"Or you can take the [world justice index](https://worldjusticeproject.org/sites/default/files/documents/WJP-ROLI-2020-Online_0.pdf), where germany is on rank 6 with a 0.84 out of 1."
10112,Man I got a couple of friends out there and it‚Äôs sad how slow it‚Äôs been for them

10114,4 versus 37 is pretty compelling.
10115,Yeah.

10162,i think a lot are expecting the news to eventually come out saying covid is fully gone you have zero risk of contracting it.

10164,i agree vast majority will cave once society goes back to normal due to pressure.the few that don‚Äôt i feel sympathy for but there is nothing we can do to help at that point
10165,Ironic.
10166,Serious question: do we have ANY idea in the slightest what causes this?
10167,As far as I can tell now after a year of reading is that COVID is *not a respiratory disease*.
10168,"It's a *blood disease*, and the first endemic &amp; airborne blood disease society has had to deal with."

10284,I personally know of multiple children who have developed life threatening mental health issues in the past year.
10285,"There is a risk to staying home, and a risk to going out."
10286,But articles like this one unhelpfully skew the opinions of people.

10296,True although I never personally knew a person that died from the flu.
10297,Sadly I do know someone who died from covid and it breaks my heart everyday.
10298,While you can obviously live without taste or smell it would be pretty distressing to have all those simple pleasures taken away.
10299,I'm not going to lie the news that people are going months on end without taste or smell returning really helped me decide to get the vaccine as soon as we were eligible.
10300,I'm not going to say that I wasn't nervous but I'm also nervous about stuff like this.
10301,And honestly this is at the low end of the terrible things I've heard about covid.
10302,"I've had Covid, and I only have weird smells when it comes to strong smells like poop and trash."
10303,It's a weird chemically smell.
10304,"Other than that, food tastes just as good as it ever did."
10305,That‚Äôs awesome :)
10306,heartbreaking
10307,That's not an entirely fair comparison.
10308,That figure of the flu rate probably follows from some kind of model - it's not like we were mass testing for the flu before COVID.
10309,"While the COVID case rates are from tests, confirmed through a test in a lab."

10333,I remember having this argument with a doctor about this when the pandemic started and he was praising himself to be a doctor and screaming left and right that masks don‚Äôt work.

10352,UK strain has been here for months.

10356,do you know is this standard practice in japan for all vaccines?i know US for example pharmacists have been able to give flu shots for as long as i can remember
10357,Your ability to carry and transmit based on contact will not change with a mask on or off.
10358,If you have any research to suggest otherwise I would love to see it.
10359,There is no reason to where a mask if you have had the virus or have gotten the vaccine.
10360,"There are other ways you can reduce contact transmission, these include washing your hands and avoiding touching things you don't have to."

10563,Haven't seen my family back home for over a year and happy to be fully vaccinated and fly there for the summer with my kiddos and make up for time loss.

10565,"I always get my shot yearly anyway, last year saw an increase in people getting vaccinated for it so hopefully that continues."
10566,This year was not the year to get the flu because concerns of double infections with covid19 were real and got my shot and my kids as soon as possible.
10567,Doesnt this also put the flu under pressure to mutate into something more contagious?
10568,Because less kids died this year from covid than died from influenza in an average year.
10569,Obviously less infections is always better.

10802,It is completely open to whomever wants to use it.
10803,"Yet, not one manufacturer has done anything with it yet."
10804,"That‚Äôs because they‚Äôd have to pay for the upfront costs to test it, then pay the upfront costs to convert their plants for it, and then hope nothing goes wrong."
10805,"If a state government was helping, then this would be fine."
10806,But no state government is lifting a finger.
10807,"Fuck, companies in India are CHARGING for the vaccine because the Indian government refuses to supplement."
10808,I keep hearing this IP talk but no one can tell me how it would work.
10809,I'm just posting here to preemptively mock the inevitable slippery slope fallacy response.
10810,Carry on.
10811,"""*It's just the flu*"" teaches us just one thing: that the person saying it is a fucking moron."
10812,"We've been relatively lucky when it comes to dominant flu strains in the last few decades (even though several hundreds of thousands of deaths these mild strains cause annually is nothing to sneeze at), but there are several strains with high pandemic potential (like H5N1 or H7N9) that make COVID-19, and even SARS and MERS, look like an attractive proposition..."

10818,This pisses me off when people are STILL saying that...
10819,Honestly my first question is going to be: did you go to college?
10820,Hope so.
10821,So variants that evade PCR tests aren‚Äôt a thing?
10822,Wow.
10823,You‚Äôre really reaching there.
10824,Make of it what you will.
10825,I‚Äôm not going to put individual studies which could contradict each other over CDC guidance which takes into account the various studies and opinions.
10826,20 &amp; 30-somethings have been done with the pandemic for a while now.
10827,They're only putting on the pretense of precaution to make others around them feel safe &amp; secure.
10828,Unless you literally set up mobile vaccine clinics like gourmet food trucks at festivals &amp; stadiums half of this demo just won't bother to get their shot.
10829,Hate to say but major employers will have to require vaccination as a condition to return to the office if we want to reach herd immunity this year :/
10830,There are certainly some measures that should be kept like paid sick leave and masking or isolation when you're sick.
10831,I thought the public health folks might be doing things a little better than a back of the napkin reddit math.
10832,I think the US surgeon general is going to have to have some answers for people.
10833,"&gt;  If we offer $100 to anyone who gets vaccinated

Dont even need to do that much."
10834,They are doing popup vax sites around here at breweries.
10835,Get a shot?
10836,Get a free drink.
10837,"I already know several people planning to go get their shot and free drink, mostly for the free drink."
10838,"For poor college kids, a free drink is worth more then the safety the shot gives in their eyes."
10839,It‚Äôs ridiculous.
10840,"Mask wearing is probably one of the most effective, least intrusive methods of stopping the spread."
10841,"If we had universal adoption of it, we probably would have saved hundreds of thousands of lives."
10842,I‚Äôm all for reopening once every one has ample opportunities to get a vaccine (which still isn‚Äôt the case!
10843,"Some people don‚Äôt have the time yet to try to find an appointment, or are too old or infirm to leave their house), but keeping a stupidly easy and effective measure to mitigate further spread is important!"
10844,People are such whiny babies.
10845,"Yeah, it might not be fully ‚Äúnormal‚Äù, but being able to do everything I could before Covid with no restrictions aside from SOMETIMES wearing a piece of cloth is no big deal."
10846,"Hell, it probably would be good in the long run if indoor mask wearing was somewhat normalized during infectious seasons."
10847,Plenty of Asian countries do that.
10848,"Putting aside whether that's entirely true (they were tested at different times, but we can certainly agree with the fact that one dose is still pretty damn good), that isn't what's being communicated."
10849,"The communication around this is ""you can get this one dose vaccine or you can get this two dose vaccine"" - there's no mention of what happens if you get just one shot of Pfizer or Moderna."
10850,"Anyone who's reading a ton about it knows the efficacy numbers and can make the reasonable connections, but most people aren't reading the actual data."
10851,"From what I‚Äôve read, some of the variants seem to make folks sicker, so while the earlier strains might have been less dangerous for younger folks, these new ones *can* be moreso."
10852,yes... it means exactly that
10853,[removed]
10854,you mean end of May
10855,Illinois has tied reopening to cases so I'm not feeling too good about our plan.
10856,Got my J&amp;J shot a few days ago so I've done my part.
10857,The state will probably close all the mass vax sites in the Chicago suburbs soon as demand for shots has really dropped off in the past 2 weeks.

10873,This article is so intense I have had to read it in sections.
10874,It‚Äôs so terrible.
10875,Unlikely you had covid.
10876,There‚Äôs your ‚ÄûBUT‚Äú.
10877,"&gt; include posting hit lists of German politicians 

What specifically does ""hit list"" mean here?"
10878,Actually calling for their murder?
10879,I feel like in a country like Germany that'd result in a lot more than just being put on a list.
10880,"Even in the States it would, calls for violence against specific people are no joke."
10881,So am I understanding your choice of words correctly?
10882,There's 100+ countries not expected to get a single vaccine through this year.
10883,Some countries are expected to be receiving material until 2024.
10884,Of course it would help.
10885,This thing is far from over for the Global south.
10886,"It's also common to think of flu as norovirus, or another common stomach bug."
10887,Which it is not at all similar to those.
10888,"Or at least it was common in my family growing up, I can only really speak for my little chunk of the social graph."
10889,https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/aad462bd-73b3-4e9f-b1cb-b5eabd680502#_I-AFIaD.copy
10890,"As I understand trials, it comes down to the relative performance of the experimental group (2 shots) vs the control group (1 shot)."
10891,"If the control group performs well, as it should, it's hard to prove that the experimental group is even better."
10892,So this trial would never succeed.
10893,I wonder if they designed it differently somehow?
10894,Otherwise it could take a really long time for differences to develop.
10895,Might have to do the trial in India to get enough challenge to separate the two groups.
10896,"Meet one of the following requirements:

- 55 years old or more
- Health care worker 18+
- 50-54 with comorbidities
- 18-59 immunocomprised with at very high risk
- Pregnant beyond first trimester
- Immediate family member of immunocompromised person

And does not meet any of these situations:

- A history of severe allergies
- Have signs of covid infection
- Close contact of Covid case in last 7 days
- Gotten any other vaccine in last 3 weeks
- Had a positive covid test in last 3 months

And now this one about obesity is added to the first list."
10897,All you people are misreading my comment.
10898,"Here are your mistakes:

1."
10899,"I said Europe, meaning the countries in a certain part of the world."
10900,I never said EU.
10901,2.
10902,France banned Armenian genocide denial.
10903,So did Greece.
10904,It‚Äôs not like I need some country to ban everything I mentioned for my point to be valid.
10905,"Yes, in talking about first dose."
10906,But AFAIK half of elderly are already fully vaccinated.
10907,"I'm a Michigander too and even in my fairly liberalish bubble I know a fair number of FIRM no's so I have my doubts about this, I'm glad Whitmer is trying though."
10908,"My guess is that eventually, she might have to walk this back if we can't attain 70% and it's also clear that herd immunity has been achieved through a combo of vaccinated and naturally immune people."
10909,"Not saying that's a given, but if infections absolutely plummet and remain that way-- well-- it wouldn't make sense to stubbornly insist on masks anymore."
10910,Won‚Äôt happen in the US.
10911,Honor system self quarantine.
10912,Just like with China.
10913,Only the people rescued from Wuhan and the cruise ship were put in federal quarantine.
10914,At what point do we think case counts start to plummet?
10915,"To expand on the other comment, it sounds like Occam's Razor is in play here."
10916,The simplest solution is often the correct one.
10917,"If you were fully vaccinated and tested negative, while it's possible that you had a variant that evades PCR tests, it's MUCH more likely that you had a really bad cold or the flu, or even RSV."
10918,Other respiratory illnesses didn't cease to exist and are still around.
10919,[removed]
10920,That was the first crime against humanity.
10921,This is the second one.
10922,Companies need to make it official that they won't be keeping you in the business or you'll have to work from home if you don't get vaccinated.
10923,I think that's the easiest way.
10924,If they all get fired they will end up getting it so they can get into companies.
10925,Did the ego boost make you a crazy good cook?
10926,Is it possible there is a variant that evades testing?
10927,Really worried about this.
10928,Smart move.
10929,They're the most dangerous human beings walking the face of earth right now.
10930,America must do the same.
10931,Happy cake day üéÇüéÇ
10932,"We don't have the data yet, so they are just not recommending waiting."
10933,I am sure with other countries waiting on the second we will have data eventually.
10934,Asymptomatic isn't the same as presymptomatic.
10935,The deaths of the world-record positive test numbers during the last 7 days are all still to come.
10936,"Maybe quicker than the usual 2-3 weeks due to an imploded health care system, but the fall-out of the worst numbers won't be visible for at least a week or so."
10937,"And at this point numbers are still rising exponentially, so god knows where this will end..."
10938,"If the current, already mind-numbing, unofficial numbers are anything to go by, it's not unimaginable that there may be several tens of thousands of people dying dying of COVID every day in mid May."
10939,Truly heartbreaking.
10940,That‚Äôs not true.
10941,We can do a lot to avoid protection and we can treat cases when there are medical supplies.
10942,This is a complete failure of anyone in the Indian government dealing with coronavirus response.
10943,Americans are forced fed propaganda about China being bad at everything so they dont freakout about the fact that China is starting to overtake the US on the global stage.
10944,They can but they won‚Äôt.
10945,Honor system self quarantine.
10946,"Welp, guess you should just stop monitoring terrorist threats right?"
10947,"They're also allowed to move and gather, they just don't gather peacefully."
10948,The News article literally says that they attacked cops
10949,Obviously there wasn‚Äôt enough ‚Äúresponsibly quarantining‚Äù done.
10950,And what are you gonna do if they get covid?
10951,Last time I checked the big issue is lack of hospitals and oxygen.
10952,Yeah... Don't rub it in buddy..
10953,[removed]
10954,The normal reproduction rate also includes people already immune from last year.
10955,In 2022 nobody has had the flu in 2 years and new strains could spread rapidly because every person that encounters it is vulnerable.
10956,Check out this [timeline of how the cases rose in India](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2u89Dqtw9o).
10957,Pretty shocking visualization.
10958,The study you posted says that 6% of all cases were caught from asymptomatic people.
10959,So literally the opposite of what you were saying.
10960,It says nothing about masks.

That's the problem."

10994,The only science you should be listening to is the science I agree with!

10997,There really is no choice.
10998,"Who is 'safer' from COVID, an old person who has been vaccinated or an unvaccinated young person?"
10999,"At some point near the start of the pandemic news spreading, the argument pivoted into presymptomatic."

11047,Love that people like you with facts are constantly downvoted here because some Americans feeling are hurt knowing China controlled Covid better than them
11048,Thx for the info.

11073,"/s

But I do not think it would be a bad idea for us to take some caution for our first winter with the vaccines and the first time we'll be dealing with flu and covid."
11074,&gt; I have to wonder about the relative efficacy of the one shot of J&amp;J vs one shot of Pfizer or Moderna.
11075,They were never tested at the same time and due to the emergence of variants between mRNA and J&amp;J trials you can't compare trial results.
11076,"This gets said a lot, but Pfizer and Moderna's US trials didn't just stop when they announced their interim readout in November."
11077,They're still going on and have been subject to the exact same conditions (variants and infection levels) that J&amp;J's US trial has been over the winter.
11078,"Based on the latest update from the mRNA vaccines (late March for Pfizer and early April for Moderna) both have maintained their high efficacy rates, with the vast majority of the cases occurring in the November-March period."
11079,My comment was specifically about kids with health risks that make COVID dangerous for them.
11080,"Do your kids have pre existing conditions that could mean a trip on a plane, through airports and other common spaces would put them at a greater risk of COVID that could kill them?"
11081,"If yes, I don't personally understand that risk."

11101,They still die from it.
11102,"Not as often as older people, but still often enough that the vaccines are vastly safer than catching Covid."
11103,That is before we look into the possibility of mutations and how it helps herd immunity to have more vaccinated.
11104,The biggest argument that I can think of is this: Think of previous pandemics for which vaccines arrived well after they ended and definitely not soon enough to prevent a large percentage of casualties.
11105,Now we have vaccines and the opportunity for you to be able to escape this pandemic unscathed (or further unscathed if you've already had Covid).
11106,"I don't know how likely a vaccine-evading mutation is to arise this early (the optimist in me says not very), but why mess around and find out when you have the option of taking an effective and safe option."

Australia did a commendable job managing the pandemic but the self isolation from the rest of the world will wear out on its citizen at some point."
11341,At least they can enjoy life in their own country without too many restrictions
11342,so many people defending the stasi in this thread lol
11343,i just found 3 of them in my car seat this morning.
11344,I‚Äôm hopeful that with this Pfizer/Moderna technique that we will be able to produce much more effective and much faster flu vaccines.
11345,Flu vaccines are really vaccines for 3 of the biggest 6-month ago flu strains.
11346,Now maybe we could cut that production time down significantly it will be 3 month ago strains and maybe add more strains even to the shots.
11347,That plus maybe we will societally change and start wearing masks when sick or during flu season more regularly Flu will be near the same levels we are seeing this year.
11348,"Only problem with less Flu going around though means less people will see the need to get the flu shot in the first place, even if they could be shown to be 90% effective."
11349,It makes logical sense.
11350,"For example, United States only has 10% confirmed positives."
11351,So only 1 in 10 people have gotten infected and known about it.
11352,Now consider that usually getting infected leads to infecting others in your family/social circle.
11353,So if we take a sample town of let's say a 100 people.
11354,Only 10 of them would have gotten infected.
11355,And odds are high that those 10 people belonged to the same family or friend circle and infected each other.
11356,So the other 90 in that town stayed infection free.
11357,"Now if you belong to a social circle outside the 10, there is a good chance you don't know anyone directly."
11358,You could have 50 friends in this town but still not know a single person directly that got COVID.
11359,Populist politicians?
11360,This was before the ruling of the ECHR.
11361,I have no clue if that law was challenged or changed after due to constitutional issues or as reaction of the ECHR ruling.
11362,Missing that crucial part already caused your wrong info about France.
11363,"And I do t know if any is ""better"", just different."
11364,https://time.com/3657434/night-work-early-death/
11365,Exactly.
11366,"In a low-information democracy, the strongest move for a leader is to wait for things to get a bit bad and then act decisively."
11367,You look like a hero and the voters feel like you saved them from something really scary.
11368,"But in high-information democracies like South Korea, who already had SARS before, the voters are willing to take the pandemic seriously before it becomes terrible because they have seen it happen before."
11369,And then non democracies like China can do whatever they want
11370,Given the rural nature of mississippi I expected it to be low.
11371,"But expected georgia to do better due to atlanta being  a big metro region

I will say I see a lot of hesitancy..not so much anti vax in mississippi

The other thing is ads and outreach for shots here consistently say bring your insurance card."
11372,This sets the perceptions the vaccines are going to cost you one way or the other and that is a big turn off in the poorest state in the nation.
11373,NO where have I seen anything that says they are free and no insurance required in ads.

11632,"[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/21/world/vaccine-patents-us-eu.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/21/world/vaccine-patents-us-eu.html)

&amp;#x200B;

the coming days, a patent will finally be issued on a five-year-old invention, a feat of molecular engineering that is at the heart of at least five major Covid-19 vaccines."
11633,And the United States government will control that patent.
11634,"&amp;#x200B;

The new patent presents an opportunity ‚Äî and some argue the last best chance ‚Äî to exact leverage over the drug companies producing the vaccines and pressure them to expand access to less affluent countries."
11635,"&amp;#x200B;

The question is whether the government will do anything at all."
11636,"The rapid development of Covid-19 vaccines, achieved at record speed and financed by massive public funding in the United States, the European Union and Britain, represents a great triumph of the pandemic."
11637,"Governments partnered with drugmakers, pouring in billions of dollars to procure raw materials, finance clinical trials and retrofit factories."
11638,Billions more were committed to buy the finished product.
11639,But this Western success has created stark inequity.
11640,Residents of wealthy and middle-income countries have received about 90 percent of the nearly 400 million vaccines delivered so far.
11641,"Under current projections, many of the rest will have to wait years."
11642,"Growing numbers of health officials and advocacy groups worldwide are calling for Western governments to use aggressive powers ‚Äî most of them rarely or never used before ‚Äî to force companies to publish vaccine recipes, share their know-how and ramp up manufacturing."
11643,"Public health advocates have pleaded for help, including asking the Biden administration to use its patent to push for broader vaccine access."
11644,Governments have resisted.
11645,"By partnering with drug companies, Western leaders bought their way to the front of the line."
11646,But they also ignored years of warnings ‚Äî and explicit calls from the World Health Organization ‚Äî to include contract language that would have guaranteed doses for poor countries or encouraged companies to share their knowledge and the patents they control.
11647,‚ÄúIt was like a run on toilet paper.
11648,"Everybody was like, ‚ÄòGet out of my way."
11649,"I‚Äôm gonna get that last package of Charmin,‚Äô‚Äù said Gregg Gonsalves, a Yale epidemiologist."

The prospect of billions of people waiting years to be vaccinated poses a health threat to even the richest countries."
11654,"One example: In Britain, where the vaccine rollout has been strong, health officials are tracking a virus variant that emerged in South Africa, where vaccine coverage is weak."
11655,"That variant may be able to blunt the effect of vaccines, meaning even vaccinated people might get sick."
11656,Western health officials said they never intended to exclude others.
11657,"But with their own countries facing massive death tolls, the focus was at home."
11658,"Patent sharing, they said, simply never came up."
11659,‚ÄúIt was U.S.-centric.
11660,"It wasn‚Äôt anti-global.‚Äù said Moncef Slaoui, who was the chief scientific adviser for Operation Warp Speed, a Trump administration program that funded the search for vaccines in the United States."
11661,"‚ÄúEverybody was in agreement that vaccine doses, once the U.S. is served, will go elsewhere.‚Äù

President Biden and Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Union‚Äôs executive branch, are reluctant to change course."
11662,Mr. Biden has promised to help an Indian company produce about 1 billion doses by the end of 2022 and his administration has donated doses to Mexico and Canada.
11663,But he has made it clear that his focus is at home.
11664,"‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to start off making sure Americans are taken care of first,‚Äù Mr. Biden said recently."
11665,"‚ÄúBut we‚Äôre then going to try and help the rest of the world.‚Äù

Pressuring companies to share patents could be seen as undermining innovation, sabotaging drugmakers or picking drawn-out and expensive fights with the very companies digging a way out of the pandemic."
11666,"As rich countries fight to keep things as they are, others like South Africa and India have taken the battle to the World Trade Organization, seeking a waiver on patent restrictions for Covid-19 vaccines."
11667,"Russia and China, meanwhile, have promised to fill the void as part of their vaccine diplomacy."
11668,"The Gamaleya Institute in Moscow, for example, has entered into partnerships with producers from Kazakhstan to South Korea, according to data from Airfinity, a science analytics company, and UNICEF."
11669,"Chinese vaccine makers have reached similar deals in the United Arab Emirates, Brazil and Indonesia."

Addressing patents would not, by itself, solve the vaccine imbalance."
11673,Retrofitting or constructing factories would take time.
11674,More raw materials would need to be manufactured.
11675,Regulators would have to approve new assembly lines.
11676,"And as with cooking a complicated dish, giving someone a list of ingredients is no substitute to showing them how to make it."
11677,"To address these problems, the World Health Organization created a technology pool last year to encourage companies to share know-how with manufacturers in lower-income nations."
11678,Not a single vaccine company has signed up.
11679,‚ÄúThe problem is that the companies don‚Äôt want to do it.
11680,"And the government is just not very tough with the companies,‚Äù said James Love, who leads Knowledge Ecology International, a nonprofit."
11681,"Drug company executives told European lawmakers recently that they were licensing their vaccines as quickly as possible, but that finding partners with the right technology was challenging."
11682,"‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt have the equipment,‚Äù Moderna‚Äôs chief executive, St√©phane Bancel, said."
11683,"‚ÄúThere is no capacity.‚Äù

But manufacturers from Canada to Bangladesh say they can make vaccines ‚Äî they just lack patent licensing deals."

It helps when the government sweetens the deal."
11690,"Earlier this month, Mr. Biden announced that the pharmaceutical giant Merck would help make vaccines for its competitor Johnson &amp; Johnson."
11691,The government pressured Johnson &amp; Johnson to accept the help and is using wartime procurement powers to secure supplies for the company.
11692,"It will also pay to retrofit Merck‚Äôs production line, with an eye toward making vaccines available to every adult in the United States by May."
11693,"**Despite the hefty government funding, drug companies control nearly all of the intellectual property and stand to make fortunes off the vaccines."
11694,A critical exception is the patent expected to be approved soon ‚Äî a government-led discovery for manipulating a key coronavirus protein.

11788,the pivotal trial was not designed to detect whether those vaccinated recipients from transmitting the disease.
11789,"even though scientists know a lot about covid and that this vaccine almost certainly dose so, the pivotal trial never examined this point so communicators might say ""the clinical trials for this vaccine did not test whether transmission was prevented from the vaccinated individuals"" and that's taken as ""well it doesn't help anyway."""

11914,"&gt;Finally, the CDC guidelines are not just timid and inconsistent."
11915,They are late: We‚Äôve known about outdoor transmission being a much lower risk for almost a year now.
11916,"We should move cautiously, for sure, but excessive caution creates fatigue and mistrust."
11917,"In the United States, case counts and deaths are trending down thanks to our impressive vaccine supply, and because of the tragic reality that millions have already attained some level of immunity from being infected."
11918,"Over the past year, we‚Äôve also gained tremendous understanding about transmission risks‚Äîwhere they are high and where they are very low."
11919,"It‚Äôs time that our rules reflect that reality, and spell out their reasoning explicitly, so they can inform and empower us as we trudge through the rest of this miserable pandemic."
11920,This paragraph perfectly sums up what has had me internally screaming at my computer and TV ever since the vaccine became available.
11921,"People in my town (which never had an outdoor mask mandate to begin with) are completely losing their minds over this, thinking that this alone will cause a surge."
11922,You are more likely to smell a fart in the wind than catch an infectious viral load of covid outdoors.
11923,This whole announcement was so anticlimactic and its delivery has only brought confusion and more fear.

11935,"The entire point of everything we‚Äôve done, from lockdowns to masks to social distancing, has been to prevent our hospital systems from getting overwhelmed with cases."
11936,That‚Äôs it.
11937,Not to prevent death.
11938,Not to prevent cases.
11939,"As long as hospitals are ok, we were good."
11940,"We‚Äôve reached the point where most people are already vaccinated, have immunity from previous infection, or are in a low risk group."
11941,The highest risk groups have extremely high vaccination numbers.
11942,This is over.
11943,"i suppose you could say not implementing it at the beginning is just another way our govt done fuckd up this thing, but perhaps they felt like people would be less inclined to get the shot if we added what looks like ""tracking"" to it."
11944,dumb people are ruining our lives man...
11945,They clean the AC.
11946,That would work.
11947,The problem with this approach is that these people not being vaccinated can keep leading to new variants evolving and potentially being less affected by the vaccine.
11948,&gt;The only thing I want to say about this is if you continue to insist covid is continuing because people are selfish and evil you‚Äôre flat out wrong.
11949,Clearly people have been wearing masks and distancing enough to not only limit the flu but flat out eliminate it.
11950,"Covid is just that much more infectious, basically the only way to similarly eliminate would be to lock everyone in their homes for month, never to leave for literally anything."
11951,Why not both?
11952,"This virus is far more infectious than the flu, but the pandemic has been prolonged by selfish behavior."
11953,"It wouldn't be an easy fight in the best of times, but if a significant portion of the population is not following the rules they can ruin it for the rest of us."
11954,"&gt;Edit: the other option would be that covid is out competing the flu, another theory I‚Äôve seen."
11955,That would be pretty nuts because it basically eliminated the flu.
11956,They're separate viruses.
11957,To compete immunity against one would have to provide immunity against the other.
11958,"The different variants do ""compete"" in that sense - if you catch the UK variant you won't catch the regular one and vice versa."
11959,"But even then, it's not likely you're getting exposed to both at the same time and the strongest one wins."
11960,"It's more that one is more contagious than the other, and you can actually track different R0 values of the different variants."
11961,Often measures which get R0&lt;1 for the original variant (i.e.
11962,: cases decrease over time as every infected person is likely to pass the virus along to less than one other person)  aren't sufficient to get R0&lt;1 for the other variants.
11963,So in those cases you see the new strains take over.
11964,Because you can spread covid to other more vulnerable people and it will take months longer to get the infection rate down so that we can all stop wearing masks.
11965,1.
11966,Take it up with the guy who wrote the slides.
11967,2.
11968,Your math isn't right.
11969,168-96 is the number of people with zero doses.
11970,168-96+69 isn't anything.
11971,"If you're looking for the number with just one dose, it's 96-69."
11972,"If you want the number of people left who need some vaccination, it's (96-69)(that's the number who need 1 dose) +46 (the number who need either 2 doses or JnJ)."
11973,That‚Äôs fair
11974,Can‚Äôt wait to be in the Meadowlands in September getting drunk and booing my shitty team.
11975,That‚Äôs when it will be officially back to normal.
11976,I think that western regulators are doing a pretty good job without their help.
11977,Haha.

11979,"I'm not quite sure, but I think it's only allowed for what is considered ""essential"" like work or family."
11980,(Don't ask me why family is considered so essential during a global pandemic.)
11981,Gotta be real pathetic to use something like this.
11982,"Pfizer and Moderna also cause blood clots/low platelets, it is a rare side effect but it happens."

11990,Similar with the heart issues.
11991,I was diagnosed with Supraventricular Tachycardia afterwards and I was having maybe a couple of episodes a week that I would monitor with a hand-held EKG and then interrupt it (using the [Valsalva maneuver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valsalva_maneuver#Heart)).
11992,I'm having those much less frequently and for much shorter periods now.

12007,AZ was not banned and the same blood clot issues were not found in Pfizer/Moderna per the FDA and UK regulators.
12008,"If it does happen with Pfizer/Moderna, it‚Äôs much less frequent."

12033,"It's not like it got straight into a population that was 55% vaccinated on an equal footing and infected 30 unvaxxed people and 4 vaxxed--most of the people it ran into in the first round of infections, which happened outside the country, would likely not have been vaccinated."

12051,"I am not saying this is the case here, but naively running a confidence interval on this data would not necessarily give you the correct idea."
12052,Statistics are subtle.

12055,I'm curious about how Broadway reopening is going to work.
12056,"Like, the shows that were in the middle of their scheduled runs when the pandemic hit, do they just pick up where they left off and finish off their runs, or are a lot of them closed for good and now we're waiting for new productions, or what?"

12058,"a lot of them are Qultists as well, yeah"
12059,"Yes, there were estimates that 50% of the Indian population had antibodies from natural infection."
12060,"Those estimates may have been wrong, and we know that reinfection is much more likely, and much more severe with natural immunity vs. the vaccine, but there is a distinct possibility that the new variant(s) are really bad."
12061,The potential cost/ benefit of stopping flights is in favor of stopping them.
12062,"Those variants are almost certainly already here, but we want to start with fewer initial cases."

12092,He was just telling me to buy my domestic flights ASAP since international travel being available will drive up cost for domestic flights because it takes them a while to get a plane off the dessert and back in routes.
12093,I think the other question is how many people who were already infected will have fading immunity over time?
12094,"If there is a large block of the population that is effectively immune today, but could get re-infected in 6 months or a year and are not getting vaccinated, that could stretch out the amount of time til this is under control significantly."

The data is by region, but if you scroll to the bottom the last Pfizer/Biontech deliveries to Veneto were on 28th and 21st."

12197,As a European.. Are you telling me I could just fly to the US?
12198,I would've thought no?
12199,You are completely right.
12200,So many Americans are forced due to money issue having to asking people if they need medical attention.
12201,Anywhere else if you are concerned you can just go get help but not fucking here you got to ask yourself if you're dying or not before going.
12202,"You know, I initially thought the same thing."
12203,"And then in November I was working on the peds heme/onc ward, and I was surprised at some of the risks my very very terminal patients were taking, including things like having birthday parties."
12204,"But then I realized- if you're turning 9 and there's a 99% chance you won't make it to your 10th birthday, shouldn't you enjoy that last year of your very short life, rather than spending it sitting shut up inside between the hospital and home?"
12205,Just gave me a little different perspective.
12206,And even kids with underlying conditions *do* tend to do okay with COVID.
12207,"That month, I had maybe 20-30 peds oncology patients who were COVID+, and all of them came through with flying colors."
12208,Even the ones with a white blood cell count of 0.

12215,That‚Äôs the longest I‚Äôve heard from anyone I know.
12216,There‚Äôs also a good amount of ppl that die from COVID months after infection that you‚Äôre seeing in the numbers now.
12217,Obviously that wasn‚Äôt the case in April of last year.

12232,What‚Äôs the consensus on when it‚Äôs safe to hang with people after they‚Äôve been diagnosed or exposed to covid?
12233,are you vaccinated?
12234,"if so you can feel comfortable doing most things, even un-masked, according to the CDC."
12235,just in case you were really worried I didn't want you to be.
12236,"Also there are connections to the Reichsb√ºrger movement, a variant of the sovereign citizen narrative."
12237,Umm.
12238,Yes I know this.
12239,I know how a crematorium works.
12240,I wanted to quantitatively understand why the existing crematorium infrastructure got overwhelmed with the excess deaths.
12241,Reaction opposed to pro action.
12242,Most governments practice this type of behaviour
12243,Unless you're allergic to rabbit fur!
12244,"Well, it's effective in that you won‚Äôt spread anything ever again if you die of the allergy..."
12245,Und es wird bestimmt noch bessere kommen!
12246,"They're at 4.19M vaccinated, 51.3% of eligible population."
12247,They're explicitly trying this to percentages of eligible population.
12248,As much as I hate to say it people will be practically forced to get the vaccine.
12249,"Oh you want to go to college you‚Äôll need the vax, high schools will probably require the vax, many jobs will probably require the vax."
12250,"It‚Äôs unreal how hard those tickets were to get, even in the industry."
12251,I can generally get tickets to most things from friends and colleagues I had to pay for Hamilton the first time!
12252,I heard this on the BBC podcast and started crying.

12263,Wooop!
12264,True‚Ä¶
12265,Good news!
12266,Here's hoping to having everything as close to normal as possible before the end of the year
12267,"42% vaccinated comes from Google: [https://www.google.com/search?q=michigan+covid+vaccine](https://www.google.com/search?q=michigan+covid+vaccine)

27% refusal comes from a March 2 poll of voters (adults): [https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2021/03/02/covid-19-vaccine-michigan-republicans-poll-trump-biden/6869393002/](https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2021/03/02/covid-19-vaccine-michigan-republicans-poll-trump-biden/6869393002/)"
12268,Wear a mask while eating even if vaccinated.
12269,"Okayyyyy....

Having no mask and coloring it yellow would make more sense."
12270,Some things just make you scratch your head.
12271,"I‚Äôve seen that, too, but also some speculation that it could be earlier."

12273,It's so funny that the side that keeps saying they are against Russia and China always have the same goals as them.
12274,"Our antivaxxers are more of the esoteric hippie side or alternatively ""the government is gonna inject 5G to sell us to the US"" kind, so being secular won't help much"
12275,The list is stupid.
12276,China is one of the safest countries right now in terms of covid risk.
12277,"UK due to its vaccine rollout, is relatively safe too."
12278,"Based on Moderna deliveries in Canada, you're likely looking at about half that amount, and delivered in 2023."
12279,[deleted]
12280,Our deaths are higher than this time last year as well.
12281,It can‚Äôt be blamed on too much testing.
12282,Nice one.
12283,I love seeing people scurry away from me when i'm walking maskless alone on the sidewalk.
12284,If only I could have a big red sign above me that said I've already had covid.
12285,"I found another article about it- It‚Äôs not just stuff like tweeting ‚ÄúThe pandemic is a hoax‚Äù, they are actually murdering ppl."

12292,"Why is speaking out against something bad seen as ‚Äúbeing political‚Äù, but the actual doing of something bad, not seen as political?"
12293,It‚Äôs all political.
12294,People on /r/JoeRogan: bUt iM a FrEe tHiNkEr
12295,A few months ago we were one of the worst states for vaccines but we really picked it up over the past few weeks.
12296,I'm hyped af
12297,Same here.
12298,"After hearing from people who got it say that they mostly just felt tired, I was not expecting the fever, chills, body aches, and nausea."
12299,Both my brother and I are down for the count and it‚Äôs now day 2.
12300,We are in our early 30s and generally healthy/fit people.
12301,I hope you feel better soon.

12303,[removed]
12304,Duh
12305,Thank you!
12306,I hope you feel better soon and i wish you a speedy recovery.
12307,That‚Äôs just not true...most European countries are on the travel ban list which means you cannot have been there within the last 14 days if you want entry to the US (unless you‚Äôre a citizen)
12308,"I pretty sick for 3 days, but not nearly as bad as a flu, just so weird to have all those symptoms all over the place."
12309,"Mostly just so exhausted, I stayed in bed."
12310,Then I was ok and back to normal activities but just tired for 2 days.
12311,"Then sudden return of fever for one day, then I woke up perfectly fine."
12312,I tested negative for antibodies.
12313,My innate immune system fought it off just fine.
12314,And I know plenty of people who‚Äôve had side effects of vaccine that were as bad or worse than my actual illness.
12315,I have an immunopenia and do not make antibodies to certain vaccines like rubella or any of the strains in the pneumonia vaccine.
12316,"At first I was like, I have natural immunity, I‚Äôm not getting up at 4 am and hitting refresh a jillion times to get a vaccine 2 hours drive from here."
12317,"This week, literally today or yesterday?"
12318,Is the first time I became aware that you can now walk in to some places convenient to me.
12319,"I may get it, I may not."
12320,"I know people who‚Äôve recovered that have had it, and for two no side effects, for one, it seems to have resolved heart palpitations she‚Äôs had since her infection, and the third has been sick for a month and unable to return to work."
12321,My guess for myself?
12322,Any side effects would be mild.
12323,Probably wouldn‚Äôt make antibodies anyway.
12324,Small risk of major side effects.
12325,I‚Äôm still thinking.
12326,"I do know two people who died from it, literally side effects landed them in bed, then pneumonia and hospitalized then dead."
12327,But they were old.
12328,There are a few thousand reported deaths.
12329,"I‚Äôm still thinking, and I‚Äôm not particularly nervous about the virus itself, so that gives me a lot more pause."
12330,"I assume when it‚Äôs offered along with my flu shot, I‚Äôll get it."
12331,I also assume that at least HALF the people yelling ‚ÄúMust get the damn shot!‚Äù were NOT religious about getting the flu shot.
12332,"Then again, an employer who fires employees for being vaccinated is not someone you want to work for anyway."
12333,Lift the IP!
12334,"My brain has been putting an ""until"" after the ""to be."""
12335,"I don't know if it was a poor transcription, a muffled word, or something, but everything I've seen lines up with later 2021, early 2022 for under 12s."
12336,"I don't, but this is an open forum and not about the two of us so it would be the decent thing to do to supply a translation."
12337,"Your article is from early march, the supposed increase for GPs was announced last week for next weeks deliveries."
12338,It's your choice to feel negatively about vaccinations in germany besides all data showing that it's increasingly picking up speed though.
12339,"use Chick-Fil-A, better service, will most likely get your order right, and be out of there in a hearbeat."
12340,I feel so ashamed of being a Frenchman with the ridiculous amount of vaccine scepticism here.
12341,It‚Äôs like a third of the country is brainwashed
12342,Sometimes you just have sit and Admire how amazing science is
12343,"Alright, all these other answers are super condescending and might make you personally feel all high and mighty, but wouldn't actually convince somebody on the fence."
12344,Real answer: the needles used for COVID vaccinations are the smallest I've ever seen.
12345,"I don't like needles either and I'm not going to go so far as to say that I didn't feel it, but it really felt more like just a prick than an injection."
12346,"Look away as it's happening and I can almost guarantee your reaction afterwards will be ""that's it?"""
12347,Funny to read the thread earlier and see what comments have been deleted and what comments haven‚Äôt.
12348,I guess he was referring to mass gatherings for political campaigns and religious festivals.
12349,"It's anecdotal, but reactions to Moderna seem more common."
12350,Likely because of the higher dosages.
12351,I think Moderna is 3x more.
12352,[deleted]
12353,I think that explains this subs obsession with masks.
12354,"Where I'm from people couldn't care less what the rules about mask wearing will be, they just want places to open up again and be allowed to see their family and friends."
12355,"If you are from one of the countries on the list in this link, you are not allowed to enter the US right now."
12356,I know this because my Belgian boyfriend hasn't been able to visit me in the past year.
12357,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/from-other-countries.html
12358,This is what people (on this sub anyway) have frequently been asking for:  It commits to lifting mask requirements at 70% vaccinated.
12359,Will be interesting to see if the carrot is effective.
12360,Interesting concept to consider for the CDC as well.
12361,"That's fair, but if public opinion was for it the U.S. could have started working on it last year."
12362,"It's 70% of 16+ population, to my understanding."
12363,Okay good for you.
12364,I hope all will turn out well and I am wrong.
12365,Time will tell soon enough.
12366,"Pfizer and moderna, I meant."
12367,"Incorrect, just google ""breakthrough infections"" mask +vaccine is the condom+ birth control idea."
12368,Either helps but together nearly 100% immunity
12369,How are they getting vaccinated?
12370,Here in Spain I know nobody under 60 who got it.
12371,I was the opposite of this dude in my mid 30s.
12372,"First shot had me feeling bad, second one had nothing."
12373,But I had covid early on.
12374,Are you calculating that correctly?
12375,"I'd love for someone to come along with a link to some actual numbers, but anecdotally, reinfection seems to still be extremely rare."
12376,"My current working theory is that - at least in the US - there's a HUGE amount of overlap between the people who aren't going to get the vaccine and the people who have already had COVID, meaning these people should have some level of immunity for quite awhile even if they don't get vaccinated."
12377,"So one way or another, many of those people are not likely vectors for spread at this point given their immunity from already having had COVID."
12378,Maybe that coupled with the vaccinated will be enough to get us where we need to go.
12379,Get.
12380,Both.
12381,Shots.
12382,People.

12387,"Actually, I do."
12388,"At 9 months, those inoculated with the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines will have 95% less symptomatic COVID."
12389,"There is zero evidence of anything else from the study participants, some of whom are approaching a year, or the 142 million in the US who have taken it since."
12390,"Unlike drugs, vaccine side effects manifest quickly, in hours, days or weeks, not months."
12391,Yeah it‚Äôs been here for a bit from what I understand
12392,"Read more than the headline please, its quite misleading"
12393,sorry but what in the every living fuck?!
12394,so now this dude who's most likely going to have a super strong chance of getting it will be brining it back with him?
12395,why would we allow this?
12396,This is interesting information - thanks!
12397,I'm looking forward to Broadway's return.
12398,Finally saw Hamilton in February of last year - had no idea how close I was cutting it.
12399,Which vaccine was that?
12400,"I don't see that suggestion in your parent comment, but nonetheless I've had these discussions - online, I don't have any friends this stupid - and apparently I'm walking mutton, I need to do my own research, and then they gish gallop me with too many other things to counter."
12401,These days I don't engage and just hope that these people are social pariahs IRL and that COVID circulates quickly among just them so they can make their contribution to getting us to herd immunity.
12402,At this point it definitely feels like the pnw will be the very last to reopen.
12403,"While most of the country is announcing plans for moving forward, we're going backwards."
12404,So depressing.
12405,"Not reinfection rate specifically, but a paper came out yesterday indicating prior infections have a 95% efficacy rate in protecting against future infection as observed so far."

12408,You don‚Äôt worry about Covid and assess risks.
12409,If you are that paranoid after getting vaccinated then stay home.
12410,Another damn article underplaying the value of being vaccinated.
12411,When will this shit stop?
12412,When does the FDA plan on approving Pfizer for ages 12 and up.
12413,Didn‚Äôt they ask for approval a couple weeks ago?
12414,Lmfao.

12420,"The best part is those numbers are going nowhere but straight down from here, too"
12421,It appears to be the case for b117 to be more contagious as well as a higher mortality rate.
12422,"‚ÄúOur analysis suggests that B.1.1.7 is not only more transmissible than preexisting SARS-CoV-2 variants, but may also cause more severe illness,"" the researchers write."
12423,"They acknowledge, however, that this study does not look at the possible mechanisms of the variant, which could affect data interpretation."

12427,Half-assed measures are always bad.
12428,"It will not only prolong the pandemic but worse, it could create an environment for vaccine resistant variants to evolve, over time."

12433,I got flu twice this year and so did our child and half his class.
12434,Flu is out there.
12435,It didn't go away.
12436,It lives in places where we don't expect Covid-19; young kids.
12437,Remember that we did not shut down and isolate our societies completely
12438,This is so misleading.
12439,The flu has not in any way disappeared.
12440,"I have confirmed a good many myself this year, the number just pales in comparison to a much more infectious respiratory virus to which we had not yet made a vaccine."

12450,Almost every action they have taken can be backed up by science.
12451,Hell the re-opening committee did a bang up job setting a measured pace for reopening so we could keep numbers down while getting business going.
12452,"Sure we've lost some restaurants in the process, but most of those were hanging on by a shoe string anyway."

12479,Contra Costa Co's numbers were shooting up during the 2 weeks that only they had opened up eligibility and residents there could use Moscone Center and Oakland Coliseum (where MyTurn directs just about everyone anyway) during that time.

12482,"‚ÄúEverything back to normal‚Äù

That‚Äôs not normal."
12483,(1/2 vaccinated btw)
12484, Just keep in mind that the article uses the inconsistent measure between the headline (55% of all adults) and the table (percentage of population).
12485,"If I recalculate the table based on 2019 data, then we'll see that Utah goes ahead of Michigan in percentage of doses administered per adult, while it is much lower than in the table."
12486,You‚Äôre mixing up cause and effect.
12487,The type of person who goes to university generally has a three digit IQ.

12497,Man there are some genuine imbeciles out there
12498,It's honestly some of the most crazy brigading i have ever seen on a subreddit.
12499,You get downvoted for literally saying what 20+ countries public health institutions are saying verbatum.

12507,*
12508,Most people don‚Äôt have the cognitive ability to.
12509,Also no amount of education can raise the IQ of an adult
12510,He works long hours in the field and doesn‚Äôt have reliable transportation to a center.
12511,They are always closed when he finishes work for the day.
12512,"CDC has not explicitly said there is a near zero chance, hence why masks are still required everywhere as they should be."
12513,"I hope even when everyone is vaccinated that it becomes law to wear masks all the time to help reduce the potential spread of any illness, even if there is a minuscule benefit, it can help extend an individuals life and especially if they are a disadvantaged POC."
12514,Exactly and if they still have a problem they can quit the company and find another one that'll accept their anti vaxx attitude.
12515,"I think once people who have been harmed are compensated by the  government,   people will be less afraid."
12516,He thinks the R0 is higher than *12-18*?
12517,Jesus he does need some help.
12518,Pfizer is currently trialing in younger and younger kids.
12519,The current projections are for 6 months+ by late 2021/early 2022.
12520,This is just so depressing.
12521,"I knew hesitancy would affect things, but I didn't know it would happen so early."
12522,My fellow countrymen truly are either stupid or apathetic.
12523,I'm not sure which is worse.
12524,"My only hope is that when full approval is complete, the bump in colleges/universities/employers/schools requiring the vaccine will help."
12525,I only had it for maybe 2-3 days.
12526,"Actually if you read the article 41 deaths total also, strange coincidence"
12527,Also less waiting.
12528,2 weeks for ‚Äúfull vax‚Äôd‚Äù status vs 5 weeks for Pfizer and 6 weeks for Moderna.
12529,What do you suppose the MMR rate is?
12530,That's the Belgians you are referring too.
12531,"The ""joke"" would land better if you said croissant"
12532,I think Australia and Taiwan and NZ are how you do it.
12533,Followed by Korea and a bunch of others.
12534,But yeah it might be #3 for how you kinda only sorta badly do it (same here in CA but segments of the population have still been annoying AF).
12535,Sounds awesome.
12536,Get vaccinated.
12537,But i see him running campaign ads so how would that work if he were somehow re-elected?
12538,&gt;isease itself.
12539,You may end up with people in certain age groups dead from the vaccine at similar rates than from coronavirus.
12540,That will cause public outcry and you will never get public trust back.
12541,You have to be prudent and evidence based and learn to pivot where necessary.
12542,"&gt;  
&gt;Rates of Covid are suppressed and they will stay generally suppressed with minor lockdown measures and with 70% of the population having some protection."
12543,You can‚Äôt just rush through a vaccination programme and unnecessarily kill people just because you want to go back to normal quicker.
12544,It‚Äôs not like there aren‚Äôt safer options out there that we can procure.
12545,"41 clots, not 41 deaths right?"
12546,"Scientifically, 5% for most models that depends on transmission, especially in the case of viral infections, is literally next to nothing."
12547,Connecticut is at 66% of eligible population with at least one shot administered.
12548,Our case numbers have fallen by 50% in the last few weeks.
12549,The positivity rate's down to 1.6.
12550,"Fewer than 500 cases found today with 46,000 tests administered."
12551,"I'll be right back, I've gotta buy some baseball tickets, soccer tickets, concert tickets and movie tickets."
12552,Japanese Breakfast just announced a show at my favorite venue.
12553,This summer's going to whip ass.
12554,I expect a lot of people to prefer the convenience of just getting one shot.
12555,Less commintment and also less chance of getting vaccine side effects.
12556,"Also, there was a lot of hesitancy in some circles about the mRNA vaccines because they were a newer and ""unproven"" technology."
12557,The normal R0 of influenza is between 1.06 and 1.18
12558,[deleted]
12559,"I'm honestly curious, why isn't the flu spreading in areas without mask mandates and large open events?"
12560,These states have been open as usual for months and nothing.
12561,"I live in a area where Covid is rampant and nobody follows any guidelines but the flu is gone, no cases what so ever"
12562,Pocket change to the US
12563,"But since I already had Covid, I already have those long term side effects."
12564,would getting a vaccine heal my future Covid issues?
12565,"If you haven‚Äôt had Covid, or had it bad then absolutely get the vaccine, just let me make my own decision about my own health."
12566,"My point was given the context and the statement it was a leading and biased statement, even if it were a fact."
12567,News headlines are a great example of this exactly.
12568,It‚Äôs the AZ brigade downvoting anything negative about AZ and declaring any naysayers conspiracy theorists and wanting the UK vaccination programme to fail.
12569,When there are more people dying of the vaccine than Covid the tide will turn but by then poor people‚Äôs lives will have been lost unnecessarily when safer alternatives existed
12570,"&gt;Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on MSNBC Thursday that New York City plans to ""fully reopen"" on July 1, with no restrictions on restaurants, retail, or any other business."
12571,"So no masks or social distancing, unless businesses require them?"
12572,Sounds like public transportation is not exempt.
12573,"It‚Äôs a sticky situation because women‚Äôs health concerns are always neglected by mainstream medicine, they are rarely listened to or considered."
12574,"It seems that this reality is being exploited by ‚Äúwellness‚Äù influencers on social media (who also just so happen to be antivax, and have downplayed Covid since the start or were on a Plandemic trip) in order to propagate this concept."
12575,Seems pretty effective so far unfortunately.
12576,You can't get COVID from the vaccine.
12577,PCR tests should be very accurate provided they are done properly.
12578,Did your father get tested after he got symptoms?
12579,"If so, it's very likely that he doesn't have COVID."
12580,"If he is sick or has a headache, it's much more likely it's just the cold or the flu or something."
12581,Also 37.4 temperature is just slightly over the normal range.
12582,I understand it can be stressful but from what you're saying it doesn't seem likely either of you has COVID.
12583,"If there wasn‚Äôt a chance for them to spread it to someone else, I‚Äôd be rooting for those fools to get covid."
12584,well don't fucking come home NOW
12585,What happens to the 1.2 billion USD the US pledged for AstraZeneca if the vaccine doesn't get approved or if the US doesn't take delivery of the vaccine?
12586,The flu shot ain't the mRNA COVID shots.
12587,[deleted]
12588,You are right sorry moderna was just slow in general but they did not promise more than they could deliver.
12589,"Awesome, glad to see your own your way to full vaccination."
12590,"Because it wasn't masks, but 2m distance and hand hygiene."
12591,Sit in a metal box and you'll be cured
12592,Hope it doesnt come back with a vengance.
12593,I think the reason people don‚Äôt get the flu shot is because they‚Äôve probably never had the flu.
12594,They equate getting a cold to having the flu.
12595,So they don‚Äôt think the flu is a big deal.
12596,"But, if you‚Äôve actually had a full blown case of the flu you‚Äôll never miss a flu shot again."
12597,Your data is 3 people you know.
12598,Your claim is purely anecdotal and asinine.
12599,This is misinformation - complete and total.
12600,I purposefully got sick.
12601,My quarantine couple hadn't seen any family or other friends in months but after they got vaccinated they let their kids hang out with a cousin.
12602,Well the cousin had a runny nose (mom claimed it was allergies) and the kids got a cold.
12603,She took them to get tested and it was just a cold and not covid so I went to hang out with them.
12604,I let the kids jump all over me and scream in my face.
12605,I don't know if I am just being dumb but I wanted to get sick to keep my immune system from getting lazy since I had not been sick in over a year.
12606,"I mean, the FDA would say that."
12607,As someone who works in regulatory affairs in Europe I can say that certainly isn't true here.
12608,Not only his opinion but the opinion of scientists from the health departments of all western countries besides the UK.
12609,"It's either completely banned or only given to 60+ in all western countries, except the UK and Canada (*40+ voluntary*)."
12610,"Can you give a cite, please?"
12611,That's a LOT higher than studies show.
12612,They literally claim that most of those excess deaths are because of the lockdowns.
12613,"Suicides, drug overdoses, starvation, etc."
12614,"They aren't pushing the chip/5G, but I feel like there's a yet in there somewhere, because of my mom asking me how to avoid 5g waves *facepalm*

Can you point me towards some science or papers backing up the stuff you're saying?"
12615,I'd like to print out debunks and then put them on her windshield when I pass by
12616,"The 95% efficacy result means that of all the members of the trial who got infected, 95% of them were out of the placebo group."
12617,"I think for Pfizer it was 170 total, 162 placebo, 8 vax."
12618,162/170 = .95.
12619,The placebo group was then released.
12620,"They can continue to track the health of the vax group, but without a placebo group to compare to they can't calculate an efficacy."
12621,Next time they have an expert AMA available I'll ask what they do with the extended data.
12622,"Rep. Dan Crenshaw, Texas

&gt;	Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R‚ÄìTX) was quite puffed up when he challenged President Joe Biden in January to accelerate the vaccine rollout."
12623,"""If the Biden administration wants to impress us, you know what?"
12624,Double the goal.
12625,Take 200 million vaccines in 100 days ‚Äì I will be impressed.
12626,"I will go on the record right now and say that I will be impressed if you can do that."""
12627,No signs from his Twitter account that he has acknowledged Biden's and all involved impressive feat.
12628,"But he's getting over surgery on his bad eye, so maybe he'll graciously acknowledge soon."
12629,That is funny because that is actually more likely to happen with the adenovirus vaccines since they do contain DNA that can theoretically be integrated into host cell DNA.
12630,"Messing with one's DNA just so they ""might"" have immunity....hard pass for me"
12631,[removed]
12632,Seriously.
12633,I was more shocked that they still had flights unless these were Italian citizens.
12634,&gt; has less than a 1% chance of dying or even being admitted to hospital.
12635,Mate.
12636,Do you know what you're actually saying?
12637,Because I highly doubt anyone reading it would accurately interpret the data that you're taking from that calculator and presenting here.
12638,"Most would assume you are referring to a CFR/IFR with your ""less than 1% chance."""
12639,"(Or the equivalent with hospitilization, is that a CHR?)"
12640,But you're not referring to a CFR/IFR.
12641,&gt;The table shows the absolute **risk of catching and dying** COVID-19 over a 90-day period based on data from the first peak of the pandemic.
12642,Emphasis mine.
12643,It's the likelihood of both catching it and then also dying from it after you've caught it.
12644,"And in case it isn't obvious that this is including in the chance of catching it, this should help make it more clear."
12645,"&gt;These absolute risks are changing over time in line with the **COVID-19 infection rate,** the extent of social distancing measures in place, and individual behaviour, and so the values should be interpreted with caution."
12646,Note:  I am not disagreeing that COVID isn't really comparable to Ebola.
12647,I would agree it is not.
12648,Just that you are not representing this info well.
12649,[removed]
12650,I think they‚Äôre trying to determine that with challenge trials.
12651,Smart.
12652,People who deny a disease exists... while it‚Äôs overflowing hospitals and morgues... live in a world where reality doesn‚Äôt apply.
12653,"When reality doesn‚Äôt apply to them anymore, laws don‚Äôt."
12654,India doesnt have dual citizenship afaik.
12655,"That being said, I agree travel from India should have been restricted like long time back."
12656,"Stasi never went away, just got re branded."
12657,Surveillance State.
12658,If only we could come up with a fitting logo..
12659,Just to go along with this -- death normally has a cadence to it based on month of the year.
12660,"I don't know how this looks for India, but playing around with this a bit in the US, it looks like 15-20% more deaths in the more deadly winter months than the safer summer months."
12661,"http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=POP&amp;f=tableCode%3A65

I expect that crematoriums are built with the upper-death rate months in mind, rather than the average."
12662,[deleted]
12663,New diet plan.
12664,"Get a little Covid and ‚Äúlose that stubborn belly fat for good.‚Äù

I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs horrible for those that deal with it."
12665,I have heard people say it os one of the worst things they have ever dealt with.
12666,Hopefully smell and taste returns to normal for everyone soon.
12667,HURE
12668,He would be charged with facilitating something you agree is not a crime?
12669,Incompetence.
12670,That's how the US got the world lead in infections and deaths.
12671,Congrats to us.
12672,How ironic that China seems to have about the best performance and USA the worst.
12673,I think it's great if people decide to make that choice.
12674,Has anyone who recirculated said document been charged with terrorism?

covid deaths: Brazil exceeds 400,000 deaths from covid-19

Brazil reached 400.021 deaths due to covid-19Image: VINCENT BOSSON/PHOTOARENA/PHOTOARENA/STAD√ÉO CONTENT

Brazil has now surpassed more than 400,000 covid-19 deaths."
12676,"The mark was reached 19 days after the country counted 350,000 victims of the pandemic and just over 13 months after the first confirmed death."
12677,"Since 8 p.m. yesterday, 1,678 more lives have been lost, totaling 400.021 deaths due to the novocoronavirus."
12678,"The data are from the consortium of media outlets, of which UOL is a part, and which calculates the number of cases and deaths with the state health departments."
12679,Brazil has been with a moving average of deaths above a thousand for 98 days.
12680,"According to a survey by Johns Hopkins University, Brazil ranks second in the number of deaths from the disease, behind only the United States, with more than 500,000 deaths."
12681,"As for the number of cases, the country occupies the third position, behind the United States and India, which faces an accelerated increase in infected people."
12682,"According to the press consortium, Brazil has 14,541,806 cases."
12683,"Until recently Brazil was the epicenter of the pandemic in the world, being responsible for one in four deaths, but the worsening situation in India and a stabilization in the Brazilian states made the center of the pandemic move to the Asian country."
12684,The stabilization of the indexes in Brazil occurred after practically all states reinforced their quarantines to face the collapse in hospitals.
12685,"The number of more than 400,000 deaths is recorded at the time when the Senate is starting the work of the Covid CPI, which will evaluate the actions of the federal government in confronting the pandemic, as well as the application of federal resources transferred to states and municipalities to combat the pandemic."
12686,"At the same time, the country has only 14.52% of the population vaccinated, with 30.7 million people having received at least one dose of covid-19 immunizers."
12687,"Covid-19 deaths in Brazil

The first covid-19 death in Brazil was recorded on March 17 last year."
12688,"It was 95 days before we reached 50,000 deaths."
12689,"The 100,000 mark was hit 49 days later, on August 8, 2020."
12690,"After another 63 days, we reached 150,000 victims."
12691,"The 200,000 dead were counted 89 days later, on January 7 of this year."
12692,"After another 48 days, the country reached 250,000 victims."
12693,"The number of 300,000 victims came after 28 days, on March 24."
12694,"After 17 days, on April 10, Brazil passed 350,000 deaths from covid-19."
12695,"Now, the country exceeds 400,000 dead after 19 days."
12696,"The peak of single-day covid-19 deaths in Brazil is 4,249, recorded on April 8."
12697,"Pandemic evolution

03/17/2020 - first covid-19 death recorded in Brazil

10/10/2020 - 150,236 deaths

01/07/2021 - 200,163 deaths

03/24/2021 - 301,087 deaths

04/10/2021 - 351,469 deaths"
12698,Why are these parents traveling and exposing their young at risk child to several opportunities for contracting COVID?
12699,I have young kids without any preexisting conditions and I am still afraid to take them to places with exposure risk.
12700,It's crazy how many people were saying 'it's just the flu bro' when the pandemic began.
12701,From the USA: I was trying to understand a sophisticated joke involving zebra‚Äôs for a minute.
12702,&gt;  No sane person can justify charging someone with manslaughter for exhaling in the vicinity of other people.
12703,And he would not be charged because of that.
12704,He would be charged with facilitating/enabling the encounter where that occurred in contravention of a public health order.
12705,Making a dangerous situation.
12706,Like not shoveling your walk or leaving a gaping pit open to mishap.
12707,I wonder if the flu shot was also far more effective this year.
12708,"If public health measures and/or viral interference dramatically reduced influenza circulation and transmission since the lockdowns started last March, that means there‚Äôd be less antigenic drift from the time they settled on next year‚Äôs strains for the flu shot (February 2020) and the 2020-2021 flu season."
12709,So in effect the flu shot would more closely correspond with what‚Äôs actually circulating.
12710,Even asthma makes kids higher risk.
12711,We shouldn‚Äôt go into the next stage of this thinking we can throw caution to the wind because most adults will be vaccinated.
12712,"As a New Yorker, I'm happy."
12713,"However, as a cautious/anxious person, I am a little concerned if this is ""too soon."""
12714,I'm assuming experts were consulted and agreed this is a safe time to re-open?
12715,"Hat das Wort ""quer"" echt die selbe Bedeutung wie Queer?"
12716,"Hab gedacht dass es nur mit Richtung was zu tun hat, laut Google auch so."
12717,Many other countries such as say Thailand for example have done this with great success.
12718,"No bullshitting the quarantine period, mandatory testing to be released, etc."
12719,This doesn't sound right at all.
12720,Goes against all the evidence out there.
12721,People are terrible at risk assessment.
12722,You have to learn to live life with inherent risk to not become a hermit.
12723,Driving your kid to school or letting them swim is far more dangerous than covid to them.
12724,"It's also only counting 16+ who get their first shot, not fully vaxxed, so basically 20% more to go!"
12725,"As a CT resident, I've been kind of low key amazed at how we've handled things."
12726,It's old old technology.
12727,There's a reason why all the rich countries didn't even field a candidate with inactivated virus.
12728,The efficacy and safety tradeoff is like decades old.
12729,Even now there are reports people have to take 3 or more shots because the immune response isn't that good.
12730,"If there's no choice, sure I would say take it."
12731,But if there is a choice nobody would choose that over the newer technologies.
12732,Not really.
12733,"The Japenese are a culturally ""socially distanced"" people anyway, for example, people don't hold hands and display public affection and all that and mask-wearing was relatively common pre-covid and things like that."
12734,"Half a million *total* cases, for a population of 120 million people?"
12735,That's seriously low.
12736,"Interesting to know where you've got your definition of what's ""considered elimination level"" from?"
12737,"Hey, atleast now its easy for you to get a vaccine since not many else are!"
12738,Is delaying the Olympics again to next Summer an option?
12739,"In 2022, the World Cup will take place in the Winter instead of Summer."
12740,"Before 1994, Winter and Summer Olympics were held in the same year, and the 1994 Winter Olympics were held just two years after the 1992 Winter Olympics."

12744,I bet you are from metro city.
12745,Never have I ever seen a decent clean government hospital.
12746,"No matter the facilities, the administration is shit nonetheless"
12747,My understanding is that since Influenza has animal reservoirs it is unlikely that (even with a year with very few cases)  the virus was eradicated.
12748,I know the negative side is that it is making it hard to know which strain will be the most active next year due to the lack of data from the previous so more than likely a vaccine that will be a shot in the dark.
12749,Not only Covid19 will still linger throughout next flu season but influenza may come back with a vengeance too.
12750,I think wearing masks during peak of flu season in indoor settings would not be a bad idea.
12751,[removed]
12752,Exactly.
12753,It sucks but sometimes things sad happens.
12754,Idk people need to make conclusions from this.
12755,The only conclusion I got was that maybe Hawaii should test under 5s too
12756,Yes...
12757,"The law is aimed to prevent the ""dehumanization"" of a group."
12758,"But it is not applied to a certain group, but to everyone."
12759,"For example: 

You should not insult anyone, since that might impact their dignity."
12760,It makes no difference who the insulted person is.
12761,Everyone has the same protection here.
12762,Thats also why I find it confusing to watch some of the US cop clips where they get insulted non stop and (mostly) just take it.
12763,Overall it is not a huge limit of the freedom to express yourself.
12764,"The ""state"" has no real say in what you can say or not, but it will help others to enforce their dignity should they consider it hurt."
12765,There is no difference between calling me an asshole or a police officer.
12766,"As a Georgian, I really don't want to look at their map."

12787,Zero doesn't mean zero actually.
12788,"There's no universal definition for ""elimination""."
12789,"For measles, it would mean no community transmission for 36 months for example."
12790,"For COVID, when community transmission is low enough for contract tracing to be able to cope with and contain flair-ups without the need for national or even local lockdowns, that's what the WHO etc are calling elimination."
12791,Suppression.
12792,Exactly.

12805,*
12806,Reading the conclusion it seems unlikely you will get infected that way considering infections from surfaces are rare and you would need to touch the surface the fly sat on.
12807,"And this: 

&gt; viral RNA was detected in environmental samples after contact with SARS-CoV-2 exposed flies, although no infectious virus was recovered from these samples

seems to suggests the virus probably doesn survive such transition?"
12808,But I am guessing here.
12809,"Another thing is viral load, it would probably be tiny."
12810,Flights from China are still banned even though the per capita cases there is probably the lowest in the world.
12811,I'm glad they went with extremely rare and not just rare.
12812,Isn't it something like close to one in a million?
12813,Might be a few weeks too late.
12814,I certainly hope the situation there improves soon.
12815,Maybe China and Russia were too soft on you?
12816,Where is this?
12817,"Around here, if your kid has any Covid symptoms, they are excluded from school and activities unless they have a negative test."
12818,Half a million cases is far in excess of what could be considered elimination level.
12819,Its probably already endemic there plus Japan's testing rate is extremely low so that figure is likely an underestimate.
12820,"FYI, Pfizer trials measured efficacy one week after shot #2, you're technically fully vaccinated now if you go off their trial data"
12821,Yeah honestly my pregnancy is probably the time I saw a doctor the most consistently and I think my last check up was probably a sports physical in high school
12822,"&gt; It has always been a matter of vaccine availability and not distribution and administration networks

That's not quite true."
12823,"Part of the reason is that politicians are constantly raising questions concerning supply, and priority patients, and their preference to use official vaccination centers rather than the existing network of GP, and company doctors."
12824,"https://www.dw.com/en/coronavirus-germanys-company-doctors-ready-to-vaccinate/a-57219880

12825,"Congrats, I'm not expecting first dose this year, maybe December if I'm lucky."
12826,"See Polio, which causes neurological symptoms later in life."
12827,I am definitely going to get my flu vaccine this fall.
12828,Flu has been on hiatus and is ready to rock and rumble.
12829,"&gt;Meanwhile, the EU has donated more doses than they've administered to themselves."
12830,"Not quite correct, most were sold and exported, not donated."
12831,"But yes, the US hasn't done even that."
12832,I have gotten a cold twice in the last few months that went through the house.
12833,Used to get the flu like twice a year.
12834,I have 3 kids in school.
12835,I haven't had the flu in about year and 5 months now
12836,That‚Äôs not to say you never encountered it though.
12837,"Not unlike covid, many influenza infections are asymptomatic."
12838,It‚Äôs also possible that pre-existing immunity protected you from getting infected even if you were exposed.

12851,They are also the subset screaming about welfare etc.

12856,"Outdoors, most restrictions are gone on May 1."
12857,"And indoors, all restrictions are lifted on May 19."
12858,Indoor mask restrictions are still in the  works for the 19th.
12859,The state is still determining if they will continue to have a mandate or reverse it to a public health recommendation (ie not a requirement).
12860,"That is still almost 3 weeks away, so no need to have the mask decision now."
12861,"But, with our (and our NE neighbors) cases dropping dramatically, I would not be surprised if the mandate is lifted."
12862,The response was terrible
12863,"I don't know that anyone has a definitive answer, but I really look forward to the retrospective on this."
12864,"Why are some states getting slammed over and over and other states, with fewer restrictions, are doing OK?"

12866,"Covid deaths are a latent indicator, as they always have been"
12867,"I'm thinking the minute these vaccines are ""approved"" by the FDA, just about every place of business in America is going to make getting vaccinated against covid a condition of employment."
12868,That should drive us right into herd immunity easy.
12869,Gonna be lots of wailing and gnashing of teeth from certain quarters though lol.
12870,Not to mention the power of marketing.
12871,"Once Pfizer, Moderna and J&amp;J get full approval, I'd expect a full blitz of targeted marketing to hit holdouts in the areas and demographics that refused so far."
12872,&gt; They're painstakingly sucking the last drops from the vial which means they're extracting 7 shots more often than 6.
12873,It depends on the region.
12874,Some states are mandating vaccination centers to do this while other states have basically forbid it due to liability.
12875,And not all GPs do it.
12876,"The Danes have been using the extra doses very consequently right from the start, I think."
12877,It gives you maybe 10% extra.
12878,[removed]
12879,Finally
12880,What would be relevant and very interesting would be daily shots per capita plotted by 7-day average.
12881,That's a common format for infection rate and death rate data.
12882,It removes all the fluctuations and noise.
12883,If Germany could do 1M/day on a 7-day average that would be amazing.
12884,"But looking at the spiky nature of that graph, I don't think that's true."
12885,"Yes, but people do wear masks to prevent spreading illness."
12886,"Source, I lived there and talked to people about this."
12887,You're a child.
12888,they are accused of it.
12889,no one is saying they allegedly did it
12890,This is nonsense.
12891,They observe the groups actively spreading misinformation and even profiting from it while harming others In the process.
12892,It's about those people who try to delegitimize the state and all it's institutions.
12893,This has nothing in common with this awful Chinese system

12999,Can you link me an article explaining this?
13000,I would like to show someone this
13001,Meanwhile Governor Murphy of New Jersey just announced that he‚Äôll have more updates regarding his reopening on Monday.
13002,It can‚Äôt be coincidence that New York‚Äôs decision has something to do with it.
13003,My guess is he wanted to be a little more cautious but might be worried that Jersey business might suffer if New York is reopened fully with little to no restrictions.
13004,People will just go to New York.
13005,It‚Äôs good to see Covid under control in both stages.
13006,They were hit hard and early.
13007,With cases and the rate of transmission plummeting in both states it looks like we‚Äôre turning the corner.
13008,Especially with the majority of adults at least having one dose.
13009,So I don‚Äôt see how this isn‚Äôt the beginning of the end.
13010,No shit
13011,I think the only way some of these people get it is talks with people who matter to them and have gotten it and incentives for them to (since some seem not motivated by the greater good/are distrustful w/e).
13012,I'm planning for a summer wedding and am asking for vaccine or a test.
13013,"If I had a newborn I'd refuse to visit those unvaccinated, personally."
13014,This was one rule my mom had when I was a baby but with actively smoking.
13015,My grandparents did give it up on top of it.
13016,I totally get what you're saying.
13017,There should be a trend towards living life more normally and also taking precautions here and there in certain circumstances.
13018,I guess the real question would be what is the transmission rate from a vaccinated person?
13019,Build back better
13020,"There flu still exists, they're just not testing for it."
13021,"They test for covid, and if it's negative and you're still sick, the directive is to stay home unless you're having trouble breathing."
13022,"Likely there are many cases of the flu, but because they didn't seek medical attention it was never tested for."
13023,I think it's a good thing that we gave a vaccine to everyone who eagerly wanted one in roughly 4 months.
13024,"Vaccine hesitancy was always going to be a problem and now we can turn our efforts toward solving it with almost 6 months to go until next fall, when the country will presumably be at biggest risk for another surge."
13025,Why hasnt AZ partner with an American pharma company that knows the FDA process?
13026,It seems like a lot of the issues are that they dont really have experience with FDA process.
13027,It's one of the big reasons I keep reading that BioNTech partnered with Pfizer.
13028,Pfizer took care of everything in the US.

13037,You have not thought this through *at all*.
13038,[removed]
13039,Countries like Brazil can't get vaccines from the West period.
13040,There simply aren't any for sale.
13041,&gt; Did you know Moderna has already waved it‚Äôs IP?
13042,"More precisely, Moderna proposed a waiver of patent rights for the duration of the pandemic because it lost a patent litigation case against Acuitas for the lipid nanoparticle patents, which could cost Moderna 20% of its revenue."
13043,There are also NIH patents Moderna hopes to use without having to pay too much.
13044,"While I agree with the rest of your argument, the Moderna case shows that even the demand for IP waiver is motivated by profits."
13045,"Yeah, I mean if he's saying we need immunity in the 90%+ range then he's saying the R0 is that high - herd immunity threshold has a pretty simple equation that's based on R0."

13092,"In Russia itself, only 3 Russian vaccines are approved, so bashing Western made vaccines technically wouldn't directly affect their own efforts."

13097,2) Similar sentinel hospitals reporting presentation and admissions due to influenza like illness.
13098,3) Lab confirmed influenza is a notifiable disease so by law doctors and labs must report it to a central database.
13099,4) Participants in an online tracking study report flu like symptoms each week.
13100,But their vaccination status is noted.
13101,If both the vaccinated and unvaccinated have an uptick in symptoms there‚Äôs some cold type virus going around.
13102,"When symptoms increase in just the unvaccinated group, it‚Äôs the flu."
13103,This measure is designed to catch the cases that are too mild to prompt a doctor‚Äôs visit.
13104,"By all measures, flu cases have dropped drastically."
13105,"Lab confirmed cases dropped from 5,000-10,000 per month to 50-100 per month."
13106,But so did the online tracking reports of flu-like symptoms.
13107,So it‚Äôs not like it was only serious cases that vanished.
13108,We have minimal covid cases/deaths so you can‚Äôt say our susceptible people already died.
13109,We had a lot of testing.
13110,Can‚Äôt find much flu because there isn‚Äôt much  here.
13111,"My wife got her second shot yesterday but the pharmacist called the no show ahead of her, he was on vacation in Hawaii."
13112,you don‚Äôt need a rebuttal.
13113,Just go get the vaccine
13114,The flu is barely spread via surfaces.
13115,Maybe 10% of transmissions max

13134,Lamont was always going to be criticized by the Republicans in the state no matter what.
13135,We‚Äôve been living in the midpoint for a while now
13136,I just listened to the comments he made on podcast this morning.
13137,I listen to a spectrum if commentators on Covid (he‚Äôs obviously on the pessimistic side).
13138,As I understood it the measles comment was in a section where he was basically saying that there will be no hard herd immunity with the new variants.
13139,Not sure he was referring to the R0 value as much as the way that for measles to actually ‚Äústop‚Äù spreading immunity has to be in the 90s.
13140,Maybe that‚Äôs just splitting hairs.
13141,And it‚Äôs still pretty alarmist IMO because if you have 7/10 of the people in an area vaccinated/immune i can‚Äôt see how you can have unending outbreaks forever but it seems what I wrote above was more the context of his statement.
13142,At least as I took it.
13143,"I was specifically talking about people who haven't yet gotten covid, sorry if that wasn't clear"
13144,"This was me a few yrs ago, same situation as you and just never had gotten around to getting the flu vax."
13145,"Then my sis got preggers and baby was due in peak flu season, so she asked close family to get the shot."
13146,"We all did and it was such a non-event, no-brainer that I just started getting it every year."
13147,"So easy, not sure why I did not do it before."
13148,Will always get a flu shot now.
13149,"Even if it is not a guarantee it is the right variant, that's a risk I am willing to take bc as far as I can tell, there is no downside!"
13150,"(not even time, bc I just get it with my yearly physical, so I would be at the doc anyway)."
13151,"I know around me some providers are planning on starting administration early in the first half of May, so probably next week."
13152,But we don't know for sure.
13153,You have to remember that viruses have exponential growth or decline depending on their R rate.
13154,North of 1 is exponential growth and south of 1 is exponential decline.
13155,"If you look at the graphs in the article, pre-pandemic we experienced an exponential decline every Summer to extremely low levels of the flu and then an exponential growth every Winter."
13156,This is because R would fall below 1 in Summer and would go above 1 in Winter.
13157,Covid precautions like masks and social distancing has allowed us to keep the flu R below 1 even during Winter.
13158,So it never had a chance to grow.
13159,"Each person is, on average, infecting less than one person."
13160,Make sense?
13161,I just got a pcr test ill get the results in few hours thx u guys
13162,People who get vaccinated aren‚Äôt dying though.
13163,It‚Äôs not even worth the discussion because the vaccines are that good.
13164,Also dumb people shouldn‚Äôt have certain freedoms?
13165,What?
13166,Aren‚Äôt they called french fries?
13167,Lol.. also a reference to the sub Reddit called Hold my fries.
13168,That's great that they put a firm goal out there.
13169,"Hopefully, it will encourage people to get vaccinated."
13170,No need for masks at that high of a vaccination rate.
13171,"The sad thing is the last thing I, as a British person, want to do is to derail the vaccination programme but I am cognizant of three things:

1."
13172,"Currently our rates of Covid are incredibly low
2."
13173,"The data is changing, negatively, for this vaccine
3."
13174,"I want as much as any of my countrymen to get back to normal

Our rates are so low it makes no sense to give this vaccine out to anyone over the age of 50 given the chance of death."
13175,"I would happily sacrifice a bit more lockdown to ensure that young, healthy people who have sacrificed the most are not needlessy sacrified again just so I can go to the pub normally again."
13176,It's just so sad seeing this vaccine rile up such natioanlistic fervor in people.
13177,There are safer alternatives we have access to!
13178,"Broadly I am supportive of this vaccine, it is good but it is good in certain demographics at certain timepoints."
13179,"That's the nature of drugs, just because it's a vaccine doesn't mean it's exempt from this scrutiny."

13391,They're declining but we were never going to be able to sustain the rate of a few weeks ago anyway.
13392,I like the chart that gets posted in this thread with it being broken down by age group -- most of the younger groups that are lagging behind because they got a slow start did roughly .5% in the latest update.
13393,If even that rate holds (hopefully JnJ coming back will offset some of the recent decline) we'll have another 15% in the next 30 days which would put every age group except 16-17 year olds at basically 50% or higher.
13394,"Also, we'll see a big boost once kids are approved (presumably in the near-ish future) that will be a big help for overall herd immunity."
13395,"And once we come off EUA we'll have the military and more businesses require vaccination which will help, too."
13396,Finally there is the fact that it looks like a big percentage of colleges will be requiring it which will help give a nice boost to those younger age groups that are maybe less interested / fear COVID less.
13397,"So, all in all, it will happen -- we'll get there."

13681,The new variants emerging around the world are less impacted by our current vaccines.
13682,"There were tough estimates in Israel that the Pfizer/moderna vaccines are roughly 8 times less effective against the South African variant and 2.5 times less effective against the UK variant considering the prevalence of both now, I can‚Äôt see how these new strains (and future strains) won‚Äôt pose a serious threat to herd immunity."

13710,There's a difference between eradication of a disease globally and ending COVID as an endemic disease in developed countries.
13711,Developed countries have eliminated tons of public ills.
13712,"The goal should always be to get rid of endemic diseases entirely when it is feasible, low-impact, cost effective, and safe to do so."
13713,"And, with what we know today, COVID definitely appears to be a disease where this is the case."
13714,"It does not mutate quickly, there are effective vaccines, it has a mutation-resistant attack surface (the spike protein), and animal reservoirs do not appear to be a common source of human transmission (as evidenced by countries that have eliminated COVID the hard way already - e.g."
13715,"Australia, New Zealand, China)."
13716,"I don't know where this public health notion of throwing our hands up in the air and saying ""meh, we tried!"""
13717,"for a disease that has a safe, highly effective (90%+ protection from infection) vaccine."
13718,There is nothing that stops us from eliminating SARS-CoV-2 from being endemic in the United States other than vaccine hesitancy.
13719,"Elimination does not require restrictions - restrictions will end long, long before the disease is no longer endemic - but elimination does require vaccinations."
13720,"This attitude that endemic spread of deadly diseases that can easily be controlled is copacetic ""because hospitals aren't overwhelmed"" is just silly and absurd."
13721,"Polio never overwhelmed hospitals either, and killed far fewer people than COVID ever did but we invested time and effort to eliminate that disease."
13722,Yellow Fever and Malaria used to be endemic in the United States - but we applied focused control and pest elimination efforts to end it in the United States.
13723,"Measles (much harder to control than COVID), Rubella, and Diphtheria were eradicated domestically as well, although unfortunately measles outbreaks are incurring with increasing frequency due to anti-vaccination communities."
13724,Cholera and other diarrheal diseases - while perhaps not technically eliminated - have been controlled completely through public sanitation.
13725,Or do you think that everyone should just be able to fling sh*t on the streets and rivers whenever it's convenient because public sanitation is too hard?

13728,Here is an article about an attempt at a universal coronavirus vaccine in the US.
13729,"It would be wonderful if this or some other attempt can create something that works against most, if not all coronaviruses."
13730,"**UCI vision researchers work on preemptive vaccine for all coronaviruses**
https://www.ucihealth.org/news/2021/01/uci-team-at-work-on-vaccine-for-all-coronaviruses

&gt;Current vaccines from the Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca pharmaceutical companies target one spike protein in SARS-CoV-2 to stop the virus from spreading."
13731,But the body‚Äôs immune system doesn‚Äôt only react to the spike protein.
13732,Scientists in BenMohamed‚Äôs lab examined more than 20 SARS-CoV-2 proteins and found that the immune systems reacts to each one of them in different ways.
13733,"&gt;Using a vaccine approach similar to one used to combat herpes simplex, their pan-coronavirus vaccine focuses on epitopes ‚Äî parts of viral proteins that evoke immune responses ‚Äî from SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, four of the most typical viruses that produce the common cold, as well as several animal coronaviruses, including those in bats."
13734,"&gt;Because many of the most diabolical viruses in the past few decades have originated in bats and transferred indirectly to humans, BenMohamed is aiming for a vaccine to protect against bat coronaviruses that have yet to spill over to humans."
13735,"&gt;Promising early results

‚ÄúAs soon as the Chinese scientists released the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2, we jumped on it,‚Äù BenMohamed said."
13736,"‚ÄúWe started identifying the building blocks and did microsurgery on the virus to identify the regions that are being recognized by human T-cells and antibodies.‚Äù

&gt;Vaccines work in two ways: first by evoking an immune response by antibodies that neutralize the virus, and second by T-cells that clean infected cells if antibodies haven‚Äôt done the job."
13737,"So far, he said results have been promising, showing that laboratory animals have produced T-cells and antibodies in reaction to the many prototype pan-coronavirus vaccine candidates."
13738,"&gt;Scientists in BenMohamed‚Äôs lab began their initial work when the SARS-CoV-2 virus' genomic sequence was released in January 2020, starting with seed money from Gavin Herbert Eye Institute, part of UCI Health."
13739,"The team then won a $100,000 so-called Fast Grant from Emergent Ventures, a program of the Mercatus Center at George Mason University in Virginia."
13740,Their current work is continuing with a $3.7 million NIH grant.
13741,"&gt;Clinical trials possible by June

&gt;BenMohamed expects to begin testing the first pan-coronavirus vaccine in early 2021."
13742,Phase 1 clinical trials to evaluate dosage and safety in humans could begin in June.
13743,"&gt;If the vaccine is successful in providing preemptive protection against all coronaviruses, this multi-epitope method may be a useful approach for a variety of illnesses."
13744,I wish I had the answers.
13745,&gt;B/c we don't know if they can transmit yet?
13746,We do know that they can transmit.
13747,"It‚Äôs less likely than if you aren‚Äôt vaccinated, but there was never a realistic chance that the risk of transmission would be zero."
13748,Respectfully I disagree.

13755,because it shows you're a shitbag.
13756,you might as well ask why it's such a bad thing for a corporation like amazon to only  pay 1% tax if they can exploit every loophole imaginable for their own personal gain.
13757,"and ask why it's such a bad thing for people to establish offshore shell corporations in order to pay ""research and development"" money to to completely avoid taxes altogether while paying themselves billions of dollars to net a ""loss"" for the fiscal year and claim eligibility for subsidy from the government."
13758,why not right?
13759,"Well no, that's not what I said."
13760,"I said the fact that, during a global pandemic, a guy like Fauci needs to make a statement about Joe Rogan being an idiot - *that's* the sad point for us as a species, yes."

13778,"&gt; Immunizer will be manufactured in the country, by the Butantan Institute, without importing raw materials; clinical trials in humans begin soon

&gt; Governor Jo√£o Doria announced on Wednesday (28) that the Butantan Institute began producing today the first batch of 18 million doses of Butanvac, the first national vaccine against coronavirus."
13779,"This will be the first immunizer of its type manufactured entirely in the country, without the need to import the raw material, as occurs today."
13780,"&gt; ""In this first stage, Butantan will produce 18 million doses of the vaccine ready for use already in the first fortnight of June, as soon as the approval process of Anvisa is concluded."
13781,This production will reach 40 million doses.
13782,But the production capacity of Butantan factory is surely for 100 million doses until the end of this year.
13783,"At the pace that Butantan has been working, if there is speed in the approval of Anvisa, still this year Butantan can produce up to 150 million doses of Butanvac, ""said Doria."
13784,&gt; The first batch of 520 thousand eggs arrived at the Butantan manufacturing complex and was immediately sent to the incubators for transfer and inoculation of the virus.
13785,"From next week on, after the incubation period in an isolated environment, the stages of allantoic fluid collection, clarification, concentration, purification and inactivation of the virus to obtain the API (Active Pharmaceutical ingredient) are planned."
13786,"&gt; The next stages, with a schedule yet to be defined, will be the bottling and the quality inspection process."
13787,"Another five batches with the same quantity of eggs as the first one should arrive at the Butantan Institute until next week for the raw material production processes, totaling around 6 million doses of API until May 18th."
13788,"&gt; The technology to obtain the API from Butanvac, largely dominated by Butantan, is already available at the institute's flu vaccine factory, and uses the cultivation of strains in chicken eggs, which generates inactivated vaccine doses, made with fragments of dead virus."
13789,"&gt; Butanvac uses the Newcastle Disease virus genetically modified, developed by American scientists at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, in New York (USA)."
13790,The viral vector contains the Spike protein of coronavirus in an integral form.
13791,"&gt; The complementary development of the vaccine will be with Butantan technology, including virus multiplication, cultivation conditions, ingredients, egg adaptation, conservation, purification, virus inactivation, dose escalation and other steps."
13792,"&gt; Newcastle Disease is an infection that affects birds and, therefore, the virus develops well in embryonated eggs, allowing production efficiency in a process similar to that used in the Influenza vaccine."
13793,"The Newcastle disease virus does not cause symptoms in humans, constituting a very safe alternative in production."
13794,"It is inactivated for the vaccine formulation, facilitating its stability and making the immunizer even safer."
13795,"&gt; The initiative of the new immunization is part of an international consortium of which Instituto Butantan is the main producer, responsible for 85% of the total capacity, and is committed to supply this vaccine to Brazil and low and medium income countries."
13796,"&gt; **Clinical Tests**

&gt; The Butantan Institute sent last Friday (23) to Anvisa the Butanvac clinical trial protocol."
13797,"Once authorized by the national regulatory agency, the phase 1 and 2 studies in humans will begin immediately, with 1.8 thousand volunteers."
13798,"Phase 3, with a larger scale of participants, should include 9 thousand people."
13799,"&gt; On March 26, Butantan had already sent to Anvisa the Dossier on Clinical Development of Drugs, containing information about the new vaccine."
13800,"Since then, technicians from the institute and the regulatory agency have been keeping close contact."
13801,"&gt; The studies of Butanvac should be conducted in a very fast process, based on comparative vaccine responses in relation to clinical trials already conducted."
13802,That is why Butantan expects to have the authorization for the tests soon.
13803,&gt; The clinical trials of the new vaccine should last about 20 weeks.
13804,They will be made with adult volunteers from 18 years old.
13805,Both those who have already had the vaccine and those who have had COVID-19 can be included in the tests.

13941,"&gt;‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no reason to be walking around with a mask.‚Äù

-~~Joe Rogan?~~

-Dr. Fauci"
13942,&gt;But the spike is slightly different in each variant.
13943,"‚ÄúThe current vaccines are based on the genetic code of the original strain found in Wuhan,‚Äù Pamela Bjorkman, a bioengineering professor at Caltech, explains."
13944,"This exact strain is no longer in circulation, so the vaccines are already slightly imperfect fits for the variants many of us may encounter."
13945,"At this point, the changes to the spike protein are not so dramatic as to render first-generation vaccines ineffective, Bjorkman says, ‚Äúbut that won‚Äôt necessarily hold as the virus continues to mutate.‚Äù

&gt;The challenge, then, is to create a vaccine that will anticipate such changes‚Äîteaching the immune system to recognize and fight off variants that may not even exist yet."
13946,One potentially powerful approach would be to target a part of the spike protein that doesn‚Äôt evolve as quickly as the others.
13947,"At the University of Texas at Austin, Jason McLellan‚Äôs lab has focused on the stem of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which doesn‚Äôt mutate as often as the tip."
13948,"In theory, a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize the stem would induce protection against many or even all the variants at once‚Äîas long as they continue to share this similar stem."
13949,"In practice, though, antibodies against the spike stem may have trouble recognizing and binding to their target if it‚Äôs tucked away in the protein structure."
13950,"&gt;Bjorkman‚Äôs lab has been working on another solution, one that‚Äôs guaranteed to generate an immune response: a vaccine that carries several different versions of the part of the spike that binds to human cells."
13951,"This assortment can be arrayed on tiny synthetic skeletons, constituting ‚Äúmosaic nanoparticles.‚Äù When Bjorkman‚Äôs team injected mice with a prototype multi-strain vaccine last year, they found that it produced antibodies against every form of spike protein that was in the mosaic."
13952,"&gt;A related approach is to start with mRNA, just as the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines do."
13953,"But instead of including the code for only one strain, you could tie together mRNA that codes for many different spike-protein binding sites‚Äîincluding the common mutations seen in dangerous variants."
13954,"David Martinez, of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and his colleagues recently reported promising mouse experiments (their work is under review) with mRNA from different coronaviruses, welded into a ‚Äúchimeric spike‚Äù mRNA vaccine."
13955,"When given to mice, the hybrid vaccine effectively generated antibodies against multiple spike proteins, including the one associated with a key variant of concern in the U.S.

&gt;To make a universal SARS-CoV-2 vaccine that provides long-term protection, we may need to think beyond the spike, Baozhong Wang, a biologist at Georgia State University, says."
13956,"‚ÄúBroad, neutralizing antibodies to conserved areas in spike protein are important, but not the whole‚Äù solution, Wang says."
13957,"T-cell responses in the lungs will be crucial, too, because they catalog memories of past respiratory viral pathogens."
13958,"These responses are predominantly induced by proteins inside the virus, Wang explains, such as the nucleoproteins and enzymes that help it reproduce, rather than its spike."
13959,His approach is to load a nanoparticle with parts of different spike proteins.
13960,I'm not sure if what you wrote is really at conflict to what I'm saying.
13961,Just in order to know what we are talking about: how many doses do you think will realistically come from the UK to the EU then?
13962,"The EU wants more doses, but in the 10s of millions, not hundredthousands."

14247,but I'm fed up with the argument that it's somehow all psychological.

14307,"That number is probably a lie(a overestimate per say, because natural immunity in the US didin't get that high either even in its worst peak, and beforehand India was ACTUALLY practing restrictions that spared them  high case counts intially, and  that meant not many people were getting it, at its peak it never got to 100k people infected per day) and it got to as low as 10k people per day before it spiked up again."
14308,That meant not many people were exposed to covid.
14309,Clearly the percentage of people with natural immunity is lower or even WAY lower than 50% in India because it never really got THAT bad until now.
14310,"That was more likely in the US because it had mutiple bad waves, India had just 1(which isn't even that bad)

14349,I never know if it's 55% of adults or 55% of population?
14350,"Because if it's 55% of population, that's very impressive, given that in Israel about 30% of the population is below the age of 16."
14351,&gt;So we should have doses from the Halix plant by the same argument?
14352,You should've gotten doses from Halix if you had agreed to sharing British made AZ earlier this year.
14353,I agree with the principle.
14354,Unfortunately that chance was missed.
14355,Now it's more tricky as the British vaccine rollout is so much further.
14356,As to your concern in another comment - ofc no second doses should be taken away.
14357,You can still spread the virus with the vaccine and not because symptoms don't show up for 14 days.
14358,If you aren't triple masking and quarintining after every trip outside you are literally trying to kill those most vulnerable
14359,That's highly misleading.
14360,You can't use breakthrough numbers compared to total vaccinated because of time delays.
14361,"For example, lets say that I am fully vaccinated, but I'm a person who won't be protected by the vaccine."
14362,lets say that I eventually catch COVID 3 months from now.
14363,"Well, for the next 3 months you would be counting me as someone who is protected by the vaccine when in reality I'm not but it just doesn't make it into the breakthrough numbers for 3 months."
14364,The breakthrough numbers would eventually trend towards the trial numbers given enough time.
14365,"And that's fine - 95% is REALLY, REALLY good."
14366,There's no need to be misleading when the actual number is so good.
14367,That's true.
14368,I agree that inequitable access is bad.

14727,It's likely that the number of coronavirus deaths is extremely inflated.

14745,"Stores, restaurants, etc out here are at least back to like 50 percent of what they used to be during covid."
14746,I think social mobility is much higher combined with the fact that there are areas with much lower vaccine uptake.

14759,It depends on the circumstances.

14761,"These kind of examples are just as meaningless as they are distracting, because it always depends on the circumstances."
14762,"The death list of people that voted for corona measures in a covid-denier chat group is a very strong indicator for what it is meant, no matter the attempts for distraction."

In other words, coronavirus deniers."
14764,"I mean coronavirus deniers are idiots, but idiocy isn't a crime, and if the state is putting those people under surveillance what resources aren't they spending on stuff that matters?"
14765,If they have state mandated coronavirus restrictions then they must have the means to prosecute those restrictions.

14823,They can always push it up
14824,These numbers are absolute bs lol.
14825,On the high end estimate we‚Äôre looking at probably 20 percent infected.
14826,We‚Äôll hit 50 percent 5/18 at current rate which will probably slow down so my guess is 3-4 weeks to hit 50.
14827,Plus keep in mind that while it‚Äôs not a perfect distribution it‚Äôs probably fairly uniform between vaccinated and unvaccinated.
14828,Meaning that only 20 percent of the 50 percent of unvaccinated have had covid or about 10 percent.
14829,So we‚Äôre looking at 60-65 percent immunity by two weeks into June if I assume you‚Äôre estimate of 25-30 cause it takes at least two weeks for immunity to kick in.
14830,Which is still pretty great.
14831,We‚Äôll probably see very low numbers in most of the country and especially in the high vaccine uptake areas.
14832,Might see regional flare ups in the south and Midwest where uptake is low but luckily these regions seem less likely to experience bad outbreaks based on how they fared last year.
14833,I think herd immunity will hit late summer (earlier in high vaccine uptake areas) but that doesn‚Äôt mean we won‚Äôt have a much more normal summer or states won‚Äôt open up sooner as we see numbers continue to crater.

15063,Every individual vaccinated person is a step towards herd immunity and to act as if the vaccines cannot work on an individual level is completely counterproductive to the goal of reaching herd immunity.

15164,But from what I know this could go several ways.
15165,With a reproductive rate of 1.5 it's 40 serial intervals (maybe 200 days) to go from 1 infection to 10+ million.
15166,"Usually 1.5 is the reproductive rate in winter and in summer it's lower, so that timeline would suggest next winter might stay low but then it'll get back to usual."
15167,But it's also possible that since nobody had flu this year population immunity will be lower and the reproductive rate could be higher.
15168,Or it's possible that flu vaccination rates could rise substantially and we just won't have flu anymore ever.

15543,"I'm not sure why I got downvoted, but I was just giving a reason why them not getting the vaccine hurts others."
15544,"Explaining this is harder than I'd expected but here's a shot:

A small number of vaccinated people were found within a group of infected people."
15545,That's all we know from this article.
15546,We can do math and know what fraction *of this particular infected group* had been vaccinated.
15547,Here it was 1/1000.
15548,BUT - we don't know how many vaccinated people there were in total - infected or not.
15549,We also don't know how many in this total group of vaccinated people had been infected.
15550,To figure out the percent of vaccinated people who were infected we'd need to divide the total number of infected people who had been vaccinated by the total number of vaccinated people but we don't have either of those figures.
15551,This might have been easier with pictures.
15552,Or more coffee.
15553,I expect this doesn't help but I did try.
15554,Are those diagnosed cases?
15555,"I'm pretty sure I've had the flu, but never gone to the doctor for it."
15556,"You can still potentially carry and transmit to others, so it's still good for reducing spread."
15557,"We're still not at a point nationally in terms of percent positivity or vaccinated % where it would be safe to roll back all mask mandates, but we're getting closer as our vax rates increase."
15558,"I think if we can get to 60+% vaxxed at a national level, we'll be in a golden zone if we follow the same trajectory that the UK and Israel did."

15564,There is hope!
15565,I will not pass judgment on anyone whose only offense was passing on a list of parliamentarians with the words ‚Äúdeath list‚Äù.
15566,I asked you if any parliamentarian has been murdered for your government to take such drastic measures against private citizens whose only likely supposed crime was writing ‚Äúdeath list‚Äù on a document in the heat of the moment.
15567,Let‚Äôs revisit this topic if and when more information becomes available.
15568,Studies are ongoing right now.
15569,This research is obviously not published yet but UHN in Toronto had vaccinated their dialysis patients with Moderna.
15570,We are waiting for results of their testing to compare which vaccine gave this patient population more protection.
15571,We are not surprised that they did not build the same immunity as the gen pop but we were surprised that many have very little to no protection at all even with both doses.
15572,I agree there is too much community transmission so herd immunity needs to be achieved

15577,This is normal with exponential growth.
15578,"We've taken extreme measures to reduce the reproductive rate of COVID by 2/3, from 3 all the way down to 1."
15579,"Flu may be transmitted slightly differently, only slightly; the same measures could reduce flu reproductive rate from 1.5 down to 0.5."
15580,30 serial intervals of a 0.5 reproductive rate would drop a billion flu cases down to about 1.
15581,But we've been doing this for more like 80 serial intervals now.

15663,Sputnik V and Sinopharm/Sinovac aren‚Äôt yet approved by SAHPRA.

15665,"Which is honestly probably a good idea, because Pfizer‚Äôs (ultimately retracted) 11th hour attempt to get us to put up our sovereign assets as collateral opened my eyes to how much (or little) Big Pharma or even the developed world think of middle-income and developing countries."

15681,I am in Spain too and the only people I know who don‚Äôt want to get the vaccine are Americans.
15682,Why is France so anti-vaccine?
15683,I saw that the over 80s have 100% vaccinations
15684,"probably out of the woods tbh, but not impossible to have side effects either"
15685,"Exactly, but its what people consider as ""threats"" is just opinions they disagree with and are easy to debunk such as far-right theories or anti-vaxx shit."
15686,These people by just believing or stating them aren't putting anyone in immenent danger unless they are directing or inciting threats against someone.
15687,So what you're saying is the next pandemic is megaflu
15688,Doesn't really matter how long it takes the FDA to approve it.
15689,They're not generally arguing in good faith.
15690,"As soon as the full approval comes, they'll make arguments like this:

It's either years (which is historically what it's taken for vaccines to go from development, through testing, to submission, to approval)...

Or, if it takes less than years, then the FDA must be skipping steps so the full approval can't be trusted."
15691,"No, we haven't."
15692,"We've had 30 years to study how to make mRNA vaccines work, even longer for adenovirus, attenuated, and live virus vaccines."
15693,"We know that COVID causes stress on the body via heart, brain, lungs, blood, other organs, and inflammatory systems."
15694,"None of the COVID complications I just mentioned are observed in people who get the vaccine, at least not the ones who are vaccinated and COVID-free."
15695,So take your anti-vax nonsense elsewhere.
15696,"Also, you don‚Äôt live in NYC."
15697,"Things aren‚Äôt going to be fully open here UNTIL July 1, as the post indicates."
15698,So I‚Äôm not sure why you‚Äôre concerned about masking.
15699,"Masks are required indoors here, and everybody wears them."
15700,"The only thing that I brought up was a post on r/AskNYC that was discussing OUTDOOR mask wearing for vaccinated people, given the new CDC recommendations."

15706,am i out of the woods or is there still a chance for major side effects?
15707,Awesome thanks.
15708,Are there any real world studies that prove their effectiveness that you can refer me to?
15709,it also depends on the distribution of vaccinated individuals.
15710,"even if we hit 70% of the total population, it won't be uniformly distributed."
15711,"so you will have pockets higher and lower than 70%, so some areas will be at higher risk for localized outbreaks than others."
15712,"Welp, international travel won't be returning back to normal for a while."
15713,Doesn't take a genius to notice that the fluctuations often line up with the weekend...  le sigh
15714,It shouldn‚Äôt though.
15715,"While the pandemic is ongoing, continued testing is critical to understanding the extent of it."
15716,It‚Äôs one of the many reasons I support passports.
15717,Make people who aren‚Äôt vaccinated test often to have access to activities and we will have very good information on how bad spread is among the unvaccinated.

15729,"I am a Biden fan, but I wish they had allowed for a bigger crowd last night."
15730,"Most lawmakers are vaccinated, so there's no reason you couldn't fill the room and not have masks or distancing."
15731,"That would have been a great message to send to the public, and a great show of what normalcy would look like once people are vaccinated."
15732,We need to stop the theater and show people that normalcy isn't scary or forbidden.
15733,Heartbreaking.
15734,Who would have thought that just one can lead to this.
15735,At the beginning of covid last March all I could think about is when this would end.
15736,I wanted to get on with life but then it‚Äôs starting to sink in that this is life now.

15740,He listens to Bret Weinstein's podcast about the vaccine.
15741,"I have never listened to it, but I don't think this is a fair statement."
15742,"&gt;&gt;There's no reason for novavax to be any safer whatsoever

That's not true."
15743,They're completely different technologies lol.
15744,"A live vaccine has different risks than an adenovirus vaccine, for example."
15745,We are already seeing issues with AZ and J+J that don't seem to be risks of other Covid vaccines out there.
15746,"Look, I got my Pfizer jab and was happy to do so."
15747,"But for someone who is completely healthy and has no risk factors, the threat of Covid is almost 0."
15748,He perceives a new vaccine technology risk without full FDA approval to be a greater risk than a virus with a 99.7% survival rate.
15749,It's not illogical to think this way.
15750,There were papers written before Covid about theoretical risks of mRNA.
15751,EVERY vaccine has theoretical risks until it's been tested-long term.
15752,It's ludicrous to say otherwise.
15753,Check out this article in Nature from 2018.

15761,COVID is not even close to Ebola's lethality.
15762,Ya I‚Äôm not sure.
15763,It may just be a way to test if a booster improves and then they can get J&amp;J boosters to people who got 1 shot this fall if they want them.

15811,"They look at what is/was spreading around the rest of the world to determine that year's mix, but if influenza was non-existent worldwide how will they know what to use for this year?"
15812,Regardless I hope the enthusiasm around getting COVID vaccines translates to enthusiasm around annual influenza shots.
15813,Far fewer side effects with the flu shot with so many benefits.
15814,History has been erased to ensure the next generation repeats...
15815,lol the taste is how poop mixed with garlic smells like
15816,"Sadly, this is just another supporting data point to the anti-maskers."
15817,"They think there has been a massive conspiracy to re-classify flu cases as COVID cases, and that's why there are so few recorded flu cases."

15819,I had my 2nd Moderna dose on Monday.
15820,I felt the same way Tuesday.
15821,Just absolutely awful.
15822,Everything hurt.
15823,"I woke up Wednesday with no fever or body aches, just a slight headache."
15824,Now today I feel totally normal.
15825,Hang in there!
15826,"Came here to say the headline is misleading, great to see the top comment explaining why."
15827,I was told only to worry once it hits anywhere in the 80s.
15828,"But yes, my dad was hospitalized with low 80‚Äôs O2 but didn‚Äôt have shortness of breath, just dizziness"
15829,I‚Äôm almost 100% sure this does not apply to positive people.
15830,"Either way I‚Äôm not going out and about while covid positive, that‚Äôs ludicrous."
15831,"In NJ, moving to PA next month."
15832,"I am very hopeful that by the middle of next month both states will be measuring cases by the hundred, not by the thousand."
15833,"Hell, that happened last year in May without vaccines, though many more people were staying at home at testing was still lacking."
15834,People who have done an in depth study of history will see if for what it really is.
15835,Sadly the school systems have ensured they‚Äôre not taught in schools.
15836,Yes.
15837,Confusion plays to their purposes.
15838,They (especially Russian trolls which I‚Äôve seen all over Bulgarian and generally Balkan news/forums) have a very good playbook.
15839,Anyone with a passing familiarity with Russian state ‚Äúinformation‚Äù knows the complete barefaced lies  they will insist on.
15840,This gives the trolls some space to ‚Äúuncover the real truth‚Äù and fool and disorient their targets.
15841,"None, go watch doctors blowing smoke out of masks as if nothings on your face."
15842,If masks worked we wouldn‚Äôt have 5k cases a day in Michigan where masks have been mandated for 13* months and everyone‚Äôs in masks everywhere you go
15843,To go where?
15844,HERE?
15845,!
15846,Remember that half of the country was under the Stasi not all that long ago.
15847,Its already gone if you are vaxxed

15851,"Is ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need a vaccine, I have Jesus‚Äù on there?"

15853,"My understanding is that we already knew if infected, you wouldn‚Äôt get symptoms with these vaccines."
15854,"But according to this, you won‚Äôt even be infected."
15855,They‚Äôre saying the risk of even being infected with the virus declined by 90 percent.
15856,"Here‚Äôs another article talking about it:

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-29/pfizer-moderna-vaccines-prevent-infections-in-real-world-study

‚ÄúCDC report suggests shots cut transmission, not just illnesses‚Äù"
15857,Agreed.
15858,"However, the authors of your linked study spent quite a bit of time stating that their results were anomalous and from very small sample sizes."
15859,I believe it was 59 people.
15860,"&gt; * The 75% of SARS-CoV-2 transmissions in our cohort from case-patients in their presymptomatic phase exceeds reported transmission rates from other investigations (1,13,14)."
15861,* A limitation of our study is that evidence was obtained from a single outbreak and might not be applicable to other settings.
15862,"&gt; * We used only information as recalled by the case-patients, which is imperfect and may introduce errors or bias."
15863,"&gt; * Because we used development of respiratory symptoms as a proxy for possible SARS-CoV-2 infections among contacts, and because incidence of respiratory illnesses was still high in this winter timeframe, SARs may be overestimated."
15864,Does that mean the stupid testing requirement for sporting events is gone too?
15865,"Never at this rate, too many people are obsessed with ‚Äúhow well they‚Äôre working‚Äù..."
15866,Because we ARE headed towards exactly thst
15867,Gotcha.

15889,It's interesting that they are not the German CIA (BND) or FBI (BKA).
15890,The US doesn't really have such an organisation.
15891,"They don't really have a constitutional court either, just the Supreme Court which is kind of different."
15892,Thank God there‚Äôs Mississippi.
15893,Hopefully not.
15894,Now we know why the masses seemed to stand by and watch the atrocities in the past.
15895,History seems to be repeating...
15896,"Can you name a single thing he ever said that could be construed as ""encouraging hate against minorities""?"
15897,Like a single one?
15898,I'm waiting.
15899,I think we should take this once in a lifetime chance to eradicate the flu completely.
15900,Part of the problem with the flu was predicting the strains each year in the flu shot.
15901,"Maybe next year will be easy to predict (or maybe not) With enough shots + social distancing,  perhaps, this is our chance to do it!"
15902,No mask everywhere
15903,I think Germany ordered an additional 30 million doses outside of the EU contract.
15904,So far the vaccination rates in the different EU countries looks very similar but it could be that since now BioNTech/Pfizer are able to fulfill their obligations under the EU contract (and deliver some doses earlier than expected) they might also ship out orders to individual nations.
15905,I guess we will see if that is true in the vaccination rates in the coming weeks.
15906,My thoughts exactly.
15907,Stumbling at the finish line like this is incredible.
15908,It's not like AZ is some new company either.
15909,What does that have to do with anything?
15910,Did they not die from covid19?
15911,"Should we only count covid19 deaths in people with BMI less than 20 and in absolute perfect health, resting HR of below 60?"
15912,[deleted]
15913,Australians are slowly being vaccinated but the Olympic athletes are a priority.
15914,"Given these other strains that are now circulating, I wouldn't go."
15915,My daughter swims competitively and I know the mindset.
15916,Being every 4 years some will not be able to maintain that level to make it to France.
15917,Sounds like a swollen lymph node.
15918,"I've had a few of those outside of my vaccination, and my second Pfizer shot caused my left one to swell just enough for me to tell it happened."
15919,"From what I've read, this is a somewhat common side effect, but nothing to be concerned about."
15920,History seems to be repeating...
15921,"If it becomes necessary for another booster shot or a new shot because of variants, I imagine getting approval for this one would help them understand what they need for the next one."
15922,Maybe the damage is done for the west.
15923,"There are billions of people whose countries can‚Äôt afford Pfizer , modernas supply is too small to supply loads , sinopharm is barely effective in comparison to these 3 and AZ being sold at cost means it‚Äôs relatively affordable."
15924,That leaves many countries with much of their rollout needing to be J&amp;J and AZ which both carry clotting risks.
15925,It‚Äôs either allow people to die of COVID over a small chance of clotting and waiting to get enough Pfizer/Moderna or use AZ and J&amp;J at least for the elderly.
15926,The distribution isn't 100% by population.
15927,When the EU ordered the vaccines last year there was disagreement how much to order of which vaccine.
15928,"Keep in mind that AZ is less than 1‚Ç¨ per dose while Biontech is 15.50‚Ç¨, so countries got the option to order more or less from certain vaccines."
15929,"Germany ordered the maximum amount of Biontech offered to them by the EU scheme, while Austria for example bought the minimum amount but went all in for AZ which now of course screws them a bit."
15930,I have no idea how Spain ordered but if it's off by population chances are that's why.
15931,"""Death List"" sounds like ""Reichstag Fire"""
15932,[removed]
15933,Oh awesome!
15934,That ain‚Äôt normal if so..
15935,[removed]
15936,The first.
15937,The Verfassungsschutz is going to put extremist parts of the Querdenker movement under surveillance.
15938,"There‚Äôs only one study that has really been done which is the Denmark one, which shows that masks have some impact on transmission but not much protection for the wearer."
15939,"There are debates about this study and how accurate it is and the factors that contribute like how strict people are, whether they‚Äôre wearing them correctly, different quality of masks (cloth vs surgical) etc."
15940,The problem is that doing real world studies is extremely hard because there are so many co-factors that go along with masking and it would be unethical to run a study where you deliberately compare the impact by exposing people to covid wearing a mask and not wearing a mask.
15941,"Because of the difficulty of conducting real world studies about masks, there isn‚Äôt much real world evidence of mask effectiveness, so people have relied on modeling, meta-data (like the cdc comparison), and lab studies to measure the effectiveness of masking and mask mandates, which do show that masks (especially n95s and high quality masks) are effective in blocking droplets."
15942,"As for a concrete answer in a large scale setting, it‚Äôs a bit more complicated but it seems that masks make a small difference (3-4% decrease in cases according to the CDC study) which during a huge epidemic would save lives."
15943,[removed]
15944,&gt; What do you think would happen if we had ‚Äúproblems‚Äù this Winter?
15945,"Most likely nothing because, generally speaking, areas that have restrictions are also areas with high vaccination rates."
15946,Those states will most likely not deal with large problems in winter.
15947,The areas that will deal with problems in winter will be areas with low vaccination rates and given those areas already have no or very limited restrictions means theyll most likely just shrug it off
15948,Yup.
15949,Some of us do
15950,Same.
15951,"Not sad about getting Pfizer, certainly, but it was a LONG 6 weeks after jab 1!"

15958,Should ideally be vaccinated only
15959,Outside this sub there were a lot of people who really wanted this vaccine in particular.
15960,"My states Facebook group for people looking for help finding available vaccine appointments had tons of people say they preferably wanted J&amp;J, for a variety of pretty valid reasons."
15961,Why not just get a flu shot?
15962,Isn‚Äôt asymtomatic transmission extremely rare?
15963,"Yup, nailed it."
15964,The unexpected J&amp;J pause has caused us to come up a little short of his projections.
15965,Hello everyone im kind of worried ny father got coronavirus but it didnt show on the pcr any idea why?
15966,"He took the first dose of sputnik V an thn developed symptoms few days after it... i was checking my temperature and its 37.4 degrees, could my pcr also come negative and could i still have it?"
15967,How many die?
15968,I thought it was virtually nil for teens
15969,Absolutely.
15970,It‚Äôs sickening

16022,"It's ok. Unvaccinated adults will get immunity the old fashioned way, or die trying."

16025,"And any immunity to flu doesn‚Äôt last very long, either from the vaccine or by getting sick."
16026,There‚Äôs also a problem with the universal flu vaccines.
16027,So far flu variants were notoriously difficult to fight off with the single vaccine.
16028,And protection from one variant didn‚Äôt work against another.

16092,"The closest thing were just conservative estimates of ""there isn't enough evidence on whether vaccines stop transmission""."
16093,It's just annoying because my parents buy into this hardcore and are still trying to get me to stay locked down despite me already recovering from COVID and being vaccinated (obviously I don't listen since I don't live with them).
16094,But I at least want to understand why people still believe this.
16095,"‚ÄúAhh shit, here we go again‚Äù - Italy probably"
16096,"Ah, gotcha."
16097,"So it started off similar, but then the grown-ups in your country did what they were supposed to, so not at all similar in the end."
16098,Germany keepin tabs on people who don‚Äôt fit in with main ideology..... Where have I heard that one before?
16099,Yes I can confirm.
16100,Of course it doesn't make sense especially in this situation where the outbreak is out of control.
16101,That's just dystopian thinking.
16102,Are you crazy?
16103,"No, the fact that it works for the flu tells us that it also works for covid, but it also shows that covid is much more contagious."
16104,Had we not taken these precautions covid would have been much worse
16105,I don't believe this for a second.
16106,I live in Ohio and all of the Amish sects I've ever come into contact with inherently keep to themselves.

16109,why cant it be both.
16110,There were tons of selfish people that are out there in clubs wearing no masks not caring there were people dying.
16111,And I dont think it was that hard to eliminate the flu.
16112,"I didnt get the flu every year, but I heard it around my company."

16217,And planing an attack is enough evidence for planing terrorist attacks (crime) and for surveillance.
16218,You don't have to already commit a crime if there is enough evidence that you plan terroristic acts for surveillance to start to prevent these kinds of terrorist attacks from happening.

16228,The article isn't clear.
16229,Well on this subreddit you get a lot of upvotes claiming (falsely) that the vaccines are 100% effective and a lot of downvotes pointing out that they are amazingly good but that 95% is not 100%.
16230,The only thing I want to say about this is if you continue to insist covid is continuing because people are selfish and evil you‚Äôre flat out wrong.
16231,Clearly people have been wearing masks and distancing enough to not only limit the flu but flat out eliminate it.
16232,"Covid is just that much more infectious, basically the only way to similarly eliminate would be to lock everyone in their homes for month, never to leave for literally anything."
16233,"Edit: the other option would be that covid is out competing the flu, another theory I‚Äôve seen."
16234,That would be pretty nuts because it basically eliminated the flu.

16384,British scientists are studying a combo of the AstraZeneca and Pfizer shots.
16385,"The study is also looking to test different intervals between doses, four weeks and 12 weeks apart."
16386,&gt;The results of such investigations may have public health implications worldwide as governments around the world face delays in getting their vaccines in a timely manner and logistical hurdles in rolling out the shots.

16398,"If I had to guess, considering they are now dealing with new variants that were not in the trials, the effectiveness is lower than 95% and therefore the 95% reduction in hospitalization does show lesser symptoms among those vaccinated who get infected."
16399,Not sure but agree that this isn't great news.
16400,We are probably nearing the ballpark.
16401,Total national protection is definitely north of 60%.
16402,They are hovering very close!
16403,At 1%!
16404,I'm guessing they hope that the next round of vaccinations should clinch it.
16405,So far neither Cuomo or BDB have done that with any of their announcements but we shall see
16406,The lack of actual travel restrictions in both admins since the beginning of this pandemic has been pretty puzzling.
16407,"I can understand that limiting domestic travel is difficult, but how is international travel even a thing right now?"
16408,But they aren‚Äôt if you follow the science.
16409,Since day one the CDC and messaging from both administrations has been to scare people into staying inside where germs spread faster and there you get less sunlight and exercise.
16410,"In no way does that maximize the health of all, especially now when so many have been vaccinated and continue to do so."
16411,And no the welfare of the unvaccinated does not come before my rights.
16412,That‚Äôs just flat out false.
16413,The unvaccinated can wear a mask if they want to hang out with me and others who are vaccinated at my home.
16414,My risk is legitimately zero as there are no cases.
16415,The 30-35% range makes a lot more sense to me.
16416,Thanks for the input.
16417,"Even if that were true, I wouldn‚Äôt mind that much."
16418,Turn Covid into a basic cold or upper respiratory?
16419,I can live with that.
16420,It's a shame it's such a small territory and there's so little written about it.
16421,"I've been trying to read more, but it's surprisingly difficult."
16422,"&gt;A wariness still hangs over Gibraltar, displayed at a recent pilot test for a soccer game and boxing match."
16423,"Worried that such events could lead to fresh cases, authorities required that attendees be tested before, demonstrate they had been vaccinated and get tested 10 days after the event."
16424,"And you get tonnes of people here saying how maskless, 100% capacity events with no entry restrictions are perfectly okay now."
16425,You‚Äôre focusing on the wrong thing when you say sample size.
16426,The sample size of actual found infections is different than the amount of people they actually tested.
16427,"The Pfizer tested 40k, but the sample size of infections showed 8 in the vaccinated group and 162 in the placebo."
16428,"A larger signal than this Israeli finding, and it was a controlled study obviously, but I don‚Äôt know how one could look at these findings and not say they are compelling or call them insignificant (I did not say conclusive)."
16429,"I had side effects‚ÄîI basically felt like I was sick (low fever, body aches) starting 8 hours after each shot and lasting for a little over a day."
16430,"But it was pretty mild, and I just took some OTC meds when it got rough."
16431,The sore arm lasted for about 48 hours after both shots.
16432,Apparently people who had COVID report worse side effects after the first shot.
16433,"My first shot was a bit worse than my second, so maybe I had asymptomatic COVID at some point."
16434,Dude people are spewing this left and right and then act super righteous saying how they will keep their masks on even when outside and vaccinated to protect others (and look down on others who don‚Äôt do the same).
16435,I need to get off the internet.
16436,Cases are rising fast.
16437,The county where Tacoma is located already had to roll back restaurant openings and it‚Äôll probably happen in the county where Seattle is located next.
16438,Same thing is happening in Oregon
16439,Love attributing causation with no evidence.
16440,Just because they lack a degree we should act like they don't exist?
16441,You literally are cherry picking to make your point.
16442,Jfc I hate humanity because of individuals like you.
16443,To be fair‚Ä¶ A big part of it is also the convenience of taking 30 seconds to ask people on the internet.
16444,Biontech arrives during the weekend.
16445,"So probably, this is this weeks' delivery."

16447,Whaaaaatt Reddit allows half-truth misleading posts on their front page???
16448,That never happens /s
16449,"No, I was supposed to go tomorrow to get vaccinated."
16450,"Same here, well, not received the large one yet, today should."
16451,I feel like there would be a massive issue of lack of man power to spy on all of them.
16452,Do we know how long it will take the FDA to give full approval to these vaccines?
16453,"I know several people who have told me they will not take it until it has been fully approved, and the argument in this article is not going to change their mind."
16454,"Of course, some of these individuals use essential oils and weight loss pills and other non-FDA approved products all the time, so I don't know why they care so much about what the FDA has to say all of a sudden."
16455,"I'm just sick of hearing this ""reason"" for not getting the vaccine."
16456,"I really hope this is masks required indoors, unless the test positivity is under 1%."
16457,With how crowded and small many stores in the city are there is no chance I doing go in many of them with unmasked people who may be unvaccinated.
16458,"That's great, but the company eating the insurance premium increase is probably a lot more valuable."
16459,"Idk how much their increase is, but over time at least is likely to save them much more than $100."
16460,"If the benefits of the vaccine itself wasnt a driving factor and I was in that situation, hands down that'd be the motivation."
16461,"My guess is as is common with antivaxxers (and antimaskers) is they don't see the big picture beyond themselves, so they'll see it as a ""even if I get the vaccine, I can't guarantee others will, so I won't bother"" (sounds a lot like, ""if I get the vaccine I still have to wear a mask"" when if everyone did, we wouldn't have to wear them anymore)  and each one thinking that means it won't incentivize them."
16462,Unfortunately it seems like it is getting stuck by the same mentality (at least on the premiums side).
16463,But ya the $100 and time off is individual based so idk...
16464,"I mean they also could be setting the bar ‚Äúlow‚Äù only to say guess what, we‚Äôre opening June 1st instead!"
16465,May be wishful thinking but who knows?
16466,It‚Äôs interesting how people are willing to believe 5G theories but at the same time discount climate change causing migration of animals to now be in contact with humans and spread new viruses.
16467,"Not saying that‚Äôs definitely the cause, but seems a lot more plausible."
16468,It's also very likely that Israel had less than half the number of previous infections per capita compared to the US.
16469,Just going by deaths per capita US may have had 3x more cases per capita than Israel.
16470,"It's a shame that that happened, but is going to allow the US to greatly reduce spread at a lower number of vaccinated individuals."
16471,"Just curious, are you vaccinated?"
16472,I‚Äôve seen 80-92% depending on the article after two weeks of first shot.
16473,Immunity probably doesn‚Äôt last as long though
16474,the kid had underlying conditions that would make it hard for them to survive covid.
16475,what were these parents thinking
16476,"Wtf this is some big brother, big government hit list shit."
16477,Creepy af.
16478,I think 12-15 will help rates in May and they won‚Äôt be fully immune until sometime in June.
16479,I think by then international vaccines will be more robust which helps with reintroduction.
16480,Can you imagine living in a country where talking to a doctor is so cost prohibitive you're forced to ask Reddit for medical advice?
16481,Under-promise and over-deliver.
16482,BIDEN 2020.
16483,Yeah we received one small and one large delivery from AZ
16484,"It's not on a broad scale, just on the narrow scale of the people who redistributed it with ""Death list"" at the top."
16485,My mom (78) had almost no symptoms after both shots of the Moderna vaccine
16486,No I‚Äôm 30
16487,French as well - leads to a bunch of confused new British collegaues in some of our company meetings wondering why the French programmer has his personal chef and seems to value his opinion on IT infrastructure a lot and no one on the German side of the call seems to be too puzzled about it
16488,Broadway is the only thing I really care about coming back to be honest.
16489,The whole pandemic I have been saying that is the thing I have missed from lockdowns.
16490,No
16491,Do you know how they got it?
16492,Did they not wear masks or socially distance?
16493,Do they have severe symptoms?
16494,You must be very old then üòÄ
16495,The country is seriously fucked.
16496,Hope does not end up like Brazil
16497,"So, Q-Germon?"
16498,"Sure, the people in question got it from the public domain *and then wrote ""Death list"" at the top before reproducing it*."
16499,How do you not see the difference?
16500,So it reduces the tghreat to hospitals.
16501,Cant wait for the Mets to break my heart in a fully packed Citi Field.
16502,Yeah I agree that would be nice but we‚Äôre working against hundreds of thousands of years of evolution with a lot of bottleneck events along the way.
16503,Every time that happens the ‚Äúweak‚Äù get thinned from the herd and the strong remain.
16504,By nature we‚Äôre descendants of murderers and rapists and some very brutal people.
16505,"Even since civilization has existed that‚Äôs been true, and civilization is basically where we realized working together is more beneficial than fighting."
16506,But then civilizations fought for resources and supremacy on a larger scale.
16507,"Evolution, as amazing as it is, has created what we are today just as much as our own individual and collective actions."
16508,Or you could have read the article.
16509,How else would you know when they plan to attack innocent people?
16510,"New Hampshire is the outlier: highest first dose vaccination rate, opening next Friday."
16511,&gt;The virus and its effects don‚Äôt seem to care who is president.
16512,I'm sure the commenter already knew that.

16514,"10th lowest per capita case rate in the country at 10 cases per 100,000 people per day."
16515,Been flat since mid March after dropping to this low level.
16516,"thx, It does, but using this pandemic time to build on a close relationship with them and learn so much more about them, so there is that and an upside to this."
16517,It when perfect.
16518,Just had a sore arm both times.
16519,Absolute madness.
16520,"Yes, and still we are speaking as masks without making a difference between clothes, surgical or KN95... maybe in 1 year we will give the next ""step""?"
16521,"Uh, okay...I guess the BBC is a disreputable source...?"
16522,Talk to a doctor not reddit
16523,The Hawaii Department of Health said Tuesday the boy is under 11 and had known underlying conditions.
16524,Yes.
16525,"Those pre-covid pics where everyone is wearing a mask are not random pics of a random Asian city in winter, but likely a pic of a very low-quality air day in Beijing."
16526,This was great‚Äîthank you!
16527,Obviously everyone is not going to a single crematorium.
16528,There are multiple in every city.
16529,This is nonsense.
16530,It is viral interference.
16531,Covid itself killed the flu.
16532,This was clear to many of us in the fall of 2020.
16533,Masks have never worked for the flu.
16534,Going all the way back to the Spanish flu of 1918.
16535,They still don't work.
16536,Hand washing doesn't do anything against the flu.
16537,The flu is gone worldwide and it made no difference what any country did.
16538,"Masks, social distancing or flu shots."
16539,It was down 99% everywhere.
16540,The flu will also make a comeback.
16541,And all of you are going to pretend that if we just wore masks and social distanced again it would be gone and that is bologna.
16542,Same with North Carolina.
16543,[removed]
16544,"yes, don't flee in panic."
16545,"leave calmly because it's the smart thing to do due to the increased risk of not getting medical care for anything else that happens to you, nevermind low risk != no risk"
16546,"BioNTech partnered with Pfizer for help with running trials, regulatory matters in other countries and to expand manufacturing."
16547,"So while Pfizer has contributed a lot to the success of this vaccine, it was developed by BioNTech themselves before involving Pfizer at all."
16548,Measles cannot mutate like influenza or covid.
16549,That's why you only need one shot as a baby.
16550,"If you read about measles, if it ever mutates, the mutation can no longer infect humans because the measles variant that gets into humans is so unique."
16551,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/05/150521133628.htm
16552,"Again, no offical document was recirculated."
16553,The official document shows every parliamentarian and who voted what.
16554,The list that was circulated contained these that voted for the restrictions and had the title death list.
16555,Ignoring that part is pretty telling from your point of view.
16556,"This is enough for investigations, it does not need actual deaths."
16557,I think it‚Äôs weird that there is no flu anymore.
16558,Just seems a bit funky
16559,This is why my wife's school has only been open for 4 full weeks since the start of 2021.
16560,People keep sending their sick kids to school.
16561,If anything this whole mess has taught me that a lot of people out there are just horrible parents.

16564,I have no idea why you would translate Quer to queer except for that it looks similar.
16565,I understand sticking to the rules and trying to not open loopholes so people can ‚Äújump the line‚Äù.
16566,"At the same time, when we‚Äôre getting down to the 50s age group, I get the feeling it doesn‚Äôt matter so much anymore."
16567,"The oldest and most vulnerable are already eligible, so just start letting those unused slots go to anyone over 18 or 16 or whatever minimum age France has."
16568,Set up a system so that anyone can sign up to get an SMS if a slot is unused at the time it begins.
16569,It makes little sense to me to stick so strictly to age groups when we‚Äôre getting toward middle aged people.
16570,"Any shot in any arm is progress at that point, I think."
16571,Just your luck eh.
16572,"Really sucks, hope you have a speedy recovery!"

16576,"As far as i know there are flights from 
Chicago - Delhi 

Chicago - Hyderabad"
16577,"Sorry, on mobile, but here‚Äôs the gist:

INDIANAPOLIS ‚Äî A blue card sat on the windshield of Josh Woolvin's black Hyundai Tucson on Tuesday, a spot of color in the sunshine at Indianapolis Motor Speedway."
16578,"It signaled to nurses at this drive-by immunization clinic that Woolvin and his mother, Debbie Shipp, wanted Johnson &amp; Johnson's single-dose coronavirus vaccine, not their other choice, Pfizer-BioNTech's two-shot regimen."
16579,"Both selected Johnson &amp; Johnson for its one-and-done convenience, a preference that outweighed their concerns about the extremely rare blood clots that prompted a 10-day pause in use of the vaccine."
16580,"‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather deal with the side effects than die‚Äù of covid-19, Woolvin said."
16581,"There is no government data yet on whether health authorities‚Äô 10-day halt in administration of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine soured people on the product, and the company declined to discuss the matter."
16582,"But in spot checks across the country, people seeking vaccines and officials dispensing them appear eager to resume using the vaccine, which is also easier to store and transport."
16583,[removed]
16584,"Vaccines don't stop transmission in the same sense that condoms don't prevent pregnancy: they typically do, in the vast majority of cases, but it's not 100% so some people should take additional precautions based on their risk factors."
16585,"We know sometimes people get breakthrough infections even after vaccination, and we expect them to be at least somewhat infectious."
16586,The message around levels of safety will change as more people get vaccinated.
16587,A fully vaccinated person in Israel is a lot safer than a fully vaccinated person in India.
16588,"It‚Äôs 90% first doses and 95% second doses, 100% healthcare workers."
16589,"There are many of us here, we just read in silence."
16590,I never saw a primary care doctor until I turned 40.
16591,"I kind of knew I had high blood pressure, but I'm not overweight and eat well, so I figured it was no big deal."
16592,"Once you turn 40, it's like yeah I gotta go get something for this or I'm going to be that asshole that died of a heart attack at 45 despite being a marathon runner."
16593,yes it has been at least in Massachusetts though not enforced at all even though it is socially enforced and everyone wears them
16594,"No, one dose is definitely not adequate..the protection is only what 94-95%?"
16595,"And that's with 2 doses, and people still slip in between those cracks and die."
16596,(A small number for those about to get their panties in a bunch!)
16597,So one is better than nothing but far from safe.
16598,"To give a little bit more context to what is meant with ""how it impacts others""."
16599,"In Germany, constitutional freedoms are two things, the right to act out the freedom without interference of the government, but also the protection against others to enjoy the freedom."
16600,"Each and every governmental action has to exist within this fight between the rights of these that should not be interferred by the government, and these that have a right of protection by the government."
16601,"In case of speech, the most common protective element is the human dignity, so the right of every person to be treated like a human and to be able to participate as equal in the society."
16602,"Speech can impact this drastically if the narrative tries to deny certain groups their humanity because of who they are, not what they do."
16603,This directly denies the humanity of the group and their right to be part of the society as a whole.
16604,"The duty of the Government is now to mitigate, to see where the necessity of free speech demands that there shall be no impact on what is said, and where the speech is so directly harming the rights of others, again, mainly the human dignity, that this right of others overrites the freedom of speech."
16605,"This constant struggle between freedom and protection is the main core of German constitutional, but also governmental law (basically every governmental action has to do this kind of consideration to be constitutional)."
16606,My state of Tennessee is at 34% this is insane how bad we are doing.
16607,I'm an old man now I did something to my hip/back.
16608,So I'm off to the chiropractor later.
16609,I can't wait to hear about how the virus is a hoax and that the vaccine is going to turn everyone into lizard people.
16610,The fact that Russia and China are running disinformation campaigns around vaccines should tell you everything you need to know.
16611,India‚Äôs problem is not that they don‚Äôt have enough vaccines.
16612,"They have enormous vaccine production capabilities, which they haven‚Äôt rolled out quickly enough."
16613,Their problem is that they ended restrictions far too early before they had deployed enough vaccines.
16614,At this point vaccines will barely make a near term dent because the virus is spreading faster than vaccines can give immunity.
16615,"Facebook did not cause the lack of critical thinking in the US, there are multiple cultural factors that got the country (and much of the western world) this this position."
16616,Facebook just seems to be the place where this lack of critical thinking is the most amplified.
16617,&gt; Has one single German congressman been killed by a covid protestor in the last 1 1/2 years?
16618,"If one had been, then I think you could call the surveillance ""too little too late""."
16619,I thought he idea was to stop that kind of thing *before* it happens.
16620,Every country is running some type of risk scoring system on its citizens.
16621,The FBI does it.
16622,Hell its what every marketing data scientist does.
16623,This is a very common method to identify populations by look alike behaviors.
16624,The part that makes it not a good thing is dependent on how its used.
16625,Utilizing behavioral actions to flag if someone is likely to be a radicalized domestic terrorist is fine.
16626,"Utilizing it in chinas method to basically do a morality score and utilize that for private day to day interactions is a problem

Hell youre credit score uses a number of past inputs to determine your credit risk and is used by potential creditors to determine if they want to take a chance with you."
16627,"Also I assume this is about 100%, not 70% fully vaccinated, right?"
16628,Take my upvote instead.
16629,Normal life is coming back fast for all of us that get vaccinated and it will be wonderful.
16630,Not so much maybe for those who are scared.
16631,It's a free country and they made their choice.
16632,We don't know the long-term effects of this virus.
16633,100% of children in one study had markers associated with blood vessel damage.
16634,There have been other epidemics and pandemics where people have had massive complications years later.
16635,"The idea that we should risk our children because ""they probably won't die and they need to go to school"" is ridiculous."
16636,Why?
16637,It's the equivalent of saying since condoms aren't necessarily 100% effective you should just be entirely abstinent to avoid STD's/pregnancy and how *dare* folks go around having sex even with condoms because you never know if you could still get an STD and then pass it along to your next partner.
16638,Clearly you're a depraved monster who doesn't care about anyone else.
16639,I agree with this notion of monitoring them and I am sure Canada is quietly doing the same.
16640,(IMHO Canada intelligence works in interesting ways - very very quiet and subtle intelligence.
16641,Let the US and allies be in the spotlight.
16642,We have very pervasive and quite good intelligence methods for Canada and International and Canadians are passive enough and aligned with the government views enough that it works).
16643,Here is why.
16644,ALso here is why this topic is so damn fascinating to me.
16645,I know a guy - a real dweeb of a guy.
16646,I haven't actually talked to him for 3+ years but he's a 'friend' on social media because Our sons played on top tier sports teams together a few times over the years.
16647,He's the dad who wasn't outwardly bad.
16648,He was refined enough to be tolerable but when it came time to hang out for a beer after the games at night nobody wanted him around because he's the slimy guy who comes across snobby and you know he's doing everything he can to angle his son into better playing time.
16649,He's helping the coaches he's the team gopher and he's a suckass.
16650,Yes he's 'normal enough' that people have him as a friend on FB because we're all on the same team.
16651,And since he's gotten himself into the team support staff we all have to tolerate him a bit more than we want to.
16652,Nobody would ever hang out with him though.
16653,WHo would... shallow selfish guy just angling non stop.
16654,Owns a business that seems successful.
16655,Has money.
16656,Has an 'above middle class' lifestyle and belongs to a private golf club.
16657,And so he's not *dumb* - intelligent enough guy to talk to.
16658,I guess my point is he went from 'normal enough dweeb to batshit deranged mental case in about 5 months.
16659,Descent into madness.
16660,Last Spring he started posting anti-lockdown stuff.
16661,Not raging lunatic stuff just a 'I'm trying to run a business' type news and videos.
16662,This I can understand (but I'm all for lockdowns at the time and we are in one now that I'm all for but I digress...) since he's a business owner his livelihood is being threatened.
16663,But around October last year his FB feed started going a bit odd.
16664,He was talking a lot about the US election and using a lot of 'we' talk like he was in a group.
16665,Again it wasn't so batshit crazy at the time because the US election news and the who (won't name him) scene in politics was nuts and it's all everyone talked about up here praying he didn't get re-elected.
16666,Except him - he started into the We need to make sure the world isn't taken over by (them was.... anyone but 'the guy).
16667,Then after the election the rails fell off.
16668,"He starts posting videos and links and 'news' (which are wingnuts pretending to be experts, or experts that are actual wingnuts) about Bill Gates committning Genocide and the vaccine is going to kill billions."
16669,Wierd shit he's posting like videos of 'journalists' uncovering 'facts' about millions of children are being locked in shipping containers and sent overseas by Hillary Clinton.
16670,In that time before Jan 6th he was posting several videos per day of how 'we need to take america back' crap (and remember... he's a born and raised Canadian... nothing reall to do with him ).
16671,And one was quite interesting the video was calling for the military to take over.
16672,Then during all the bullshit ballot recounts and lawsuits he posted how 'we will win these lawsuits'.
16673,Etc etc.

16677,People are basically watching his descent into madness real time on social media and not giving a shit about the guy.
16678,He's a dweeb.
16679,But as I study the situation lately he's starting to likes on his posts by - generally - white guys aged 40-60.
16680,And he's turned now to an anti-trudeau theme.
16681,So I started reporting his stories to FB and his profile - only takes a click and I figured they'd remove them and maybe kick him off.
16682,If his video forwards influence even 1 or 2 of his 500 'friends' that's bad.
16683,But FB ignores the situation and he's still up there spewing stuff every day.

## Abstract

### Background

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a recently emerged coronavirus that is the causative agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic."
16868,COVID-19 in humans is characterized by a wide range of symptoms that range from asymptomatic to mild or severe illness including death.
16869,"SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and is transmitted via the oral‚Äìnasal route through droplets and aerosols, or through contact with contaminated fomites."
16870,"House flies are known to transmit bacterial, parasitic and viral diseases to humans and animals as mechanical vectors."
16871,"Previous studies have shown that house flies can mechanically transmit coronaviruses, such as turkey coronavirus; however, the house fly‚Äôs role in SARS-CoV-2 transmission has not yet been explored."
16872,The goal of this work was to investigate the potential of house flies to mechanically transmit SARS-CoV-2.
16873,"For this purpose, it was determined whether house flies can acquire SARS-CoV-2, harbor live virus and mechanically transmit the virus to naive substrates and surfaces."
16874,"### Methods

Two independent studies were performed to address the study objectives."
16875,"In the first study, house flies were tested for infectivity after exposure to SARS-CoV-2-spiked medium or milk."
16876,"In the second study, environmental samples were tested for infectivity after contact with SARS-CoV-2-exposed flies."
16877,"During both studies, samples were collected at various time points post-exposure and evaluated by SARS-CoV-2-specific RT-qPCR and virus isolation."
16878,"### Results

All flies exposed to SARS-CoV-2-spiked media or milk substrates were positive for viral RNA at 4¬†h and 24¬†h post-exposure."
16879,Infectious virus was isolated only from the flies exposed to virus-spiked milk but not from those exposed to virus-spiked medium.
16880,"Moreover, viral RNA was detected in environmental samples after contact with SARS-CoV-2 exposed flies, although no infectious virus was recovered from these samples."
16881,"### Conclusions

Under laboratory conditions, house flies acquired and harbored infectious SARS-CoV-2 for up to 24¬†h post-exposure."
16882,"In addition, house flies were able to mechanically transmit SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA to the surrounding environment up to 24¬†h post-exposure."
16883,Further studies are warranted to determine if house fly transmission occurs naturally and the potential public health implications of such events.

16922,"You're suggesting that the sample size is 41 and of that sample, you have 4/41 vs 37/41, which is not correct."
16923,The sample size is those that have had a measured test against COVID such as PCR tests (which to be fair to you isn't stated in the article) and in particular during the potential exposure to the variant from India.
16924,"This is where you can bring in 'insignificance' to some extent, but we use clinical significance and CI, which, in a case where the sample size is inadequate, will be large and whatsmore I think you're using the term 'signifiance' loosely rather than in the usual way in which we use clinical significance (often aiming for p&lt;0.05) (please correct me if you were in fact suggesting that you think this is clinically significant)."
16925,"Also, for some odd reason, you've then decided to bring in ""wait till you see the size of the signal they used in the Pfizer study before applying for emergency use"" which is nothing to do with this article."
16926,"Adequate sample sizes work on a few things including the desired power of your study, population size, variance etc."
16927,"You can't just pluck a number out and say ""this will do, that's enough to draw a significant conclusion from""."
16928,A really good example of this can be seen with the erroneous assumption that hydroxychloroquine had great efficacy against COVID.
16929,you can thank the CDC and the media for that
16930,"I think we would need a specific case to argue about the details, but:  

&gt; The correct way to do this is to openly question the validity of their lies and hatred so people can hear or see the arguements against it."
16931,That's exactly what happens.
16932,"Covid deniers, Reichsb√ºrger, Pegida... they all get their demonstrations officially approved and even police protection."
16933,That doesn't mean the intelligence service for protection of the constitution can't have an eye on people who give a lot of room for the suspicion that they oppose the basic democratic order of the country.

16946,"The US far surpassed India's current per capita disease levels during the winter, but was able to adequately care for the sick."
16947,Any new data on reinfection rates for people who already had Covid?
16948,"I feel like even if we don't get to a super high percentage of vaccine uptake, the virus will eventually infect enough people to get us to herd immunity."
16949,"Yeah, some people will die unnecessarily (their fault at this point), and there may be some risk of new variants, but so far every new variant has been beatable by the current vaccines, and new boosters will always be in development."
16950,I feel like our worries about the vaccine-hesitant are overblown.
16951,"Get your jab, get back to normal, and open up ASAP."
16952,I can read that in German.
16953,I used to manage my wife's Ob/Gyn practice.
16954,I would be on the phone working nights to contact just 20 people eligible for vaccination.
16955,That's why my GP is doing this on Thursday even though he got supply on Wednesday.
16956,It took his staff a couple of days to line people up for Thursday.
16957,We should also keep in mind that a lot of Germans are turning down the AZ vaccine.

16969,Also the grounds for a stronger mutation that overcomes the vaccine.
16970,Then we‚Äôre in trouble.
16971,"Hoping we get some better data about B1617/B1618 soon, it‚Äôs strange that nothing detailed has come out yet."
16972,"How, exactly, have we benefited from test &amp; trace despite the billions we've spent on it?"
16973,We've created supply constraints on all types of other tests... it can still take weeks to get back some routine test results.
16974,It doesn't tell us anything that we can't already know from a diagnosis by a health professional based on symptoms.
16975,There's just no benefit testing healthy / asymptomatic people.
16976,CT is dumping all restrictions except for masking on May 19.

16979,Have an upvote.

I mean, there's also no evidence of the opposite being provided."

I'm allowed to bring other information into this to create an informed decision on whether I agree with the headline or not, aren't I?"

17211,"&gt;Note that 4 cases are now confirmed from the second dose out of about 4.4m vaccinations 
..

&gt; The oft-repeated claim that dose 2 is totally safe is starting to fall down."
17212,Have read many of your posts and I know you're not the biggest fan of the AZ vaccine or strategy in UK and that shines through quite brightly in your messages.
17213,"it's fair to cover the topic of course, this is what's reddit is about but please let's try and be a little impartial here

I've read almost every thread on this topic on various subreddits, social media etc ."
17214,"Generally speaking people are not claiming that dose 2 is ""totally safe""."
17215,That is not an oft-repeated claim here or really elsewhere.
17216,it's not the consensus of the crowd.
17217,To best of my knowledge no regulatory body or government official has claimed that either.
17218,"The oft made claim made is a more charitable one in context- that the incidence of VITT observed in connection with second doses (to date) have been ( at the time of writing) less common than post first dose incidence-  this was, and  still *is* backed up by evidence."
17219,"Anyone who made such statements are not lying, they're just reporting reflection of the statistics."
17220,"If the incidence changes based on vaccinating more younger cohorts with second doses, lagging reporting etc that's fine, guidance can reflect that- but that isn't what's shown yet, so naturally it's not right to claim the risk post second dose is confirmed identical to risk post first dose."
17221,4 cases out of 4.4M per second dose is well within the background incidence and for now notably lower than equivalent post first dose development reported.
17222,"This is incredibly frustrating because many women are reporting issues with their periods and the vaccines, but the issue is being hijacked by antivaxxers to shun people who are vaccinated with a crazy warping of what women have said and an absolute falsehood that some one else's vaccine could interfere with another person's period."
17223,It's preying on both a lack of knowledge of how the vaccine works and a lack of knowledge on how periods work in certain groups of people.
17224,It's also likely to derail legitimate concerns women have about their menstrual cycles.
17225,I feel like antivaxxers are using this because they needed to find a way to counter people pointing out that their lack of vaccinations affected other people in a negative way.
17226,Did you miss the comment up this very chain that noted that the flu has animal reservoirs?
17227,We could take these protective measures *for a hundred years* and not eradicate the flu.

17235,Nothing in any of your convoluted logic goes against the statement that flu is down to very low levels.

17617,"This isn‚Äôt the case for this story, as the child has underlying conditions, but for people in the case I described I hold no ill regard"
17618,I've cut a little opening in my mask so that a straw fits through.
17619,I grind up my food to the point where it will pass through a straw.
17620,"Restaurants are a little confused when I ask for an extension cord to plug my blender into, but it's working out okay."
17621,Why do people make up such stories
17622,Not really... only Michigan and it's going down for good now.
17623,Loss of taste and smell has been widely discussed.
17624,I don't think the symptom of food smelling and tasting really bad has.
17625,Brazil seems to be trying to catch up to the USA
17626,Bump!
17627,!
17628,"BTW, another big distinction between the German numbers and what most other countries report is that the percentage of vaccinated people includes the entire population and not just the 18+."
17629,Adjusted for 18+ the percentage is closer roughly 31.5%
17630,That's not what the CDC guidelines show?
17631,Its exhausting isn‚Äôt it?
17632,"I get that some people like to complain, but the constant pessimism in the face of data that shows an acceleration in supply and delivery should make us more optimistic!"
17633,Yeah I'm from Denmark and can't go.
17634,Expected.
17635,And makes sense.
17636,Totally agree.
17637,It's looking like it'll be that way in Texas at least.
17638,"COVID may still be around, but anyone who wants a vaccine will have had one by then, so it'll be the end as far as most people are concerned."
17639,And many people don't even go to a doctor.
17640,Well Pfizer would have been able to file in early April and Moderna hit their 6 month mark today.
17641,Pfizer expects a decision in H2 2021.
17642,No word on Moderna.
17643,The dog will get paid in dogecoin.
17644,Fuck the bjp.
17645,&gt;I hate you for trying to keep me alive!!
17646,???
17647,?
17648,You only go inside with your food already under your mask.
17649,It's also logistics issues.
17650,People who travel frequently for work or don't have steady hours can't guarantee they'll be available for a second appointment.
17651,"Ihave a friend who doesn't even know what state he'll be in in a month, for example."

17658,This will be a super interesting case study for policy makers nationwide.
17659,"At least politically, Michigan is fairly representative of the country (voted just 1.5% to the right of the nation for Trump in November)."
17660,"Thus, if we start to see MIs vaccination rate pull ahead of the national average in the next month or so, I think we could be reasonably confident that vaccination-linked restriction metrics are good policy."
17661,[removed]
17662,I imagine that scenario would cause some form of explosion.
17663,"They just announced people with BMI over 30 as the next priority group but that's about a week worth of shots (about 2M people) at the speed it's going now, so they will need to add more very soon."
17664,I don't really see the point of micromanaging the age groups either.
17665,"Most of the older folks who wanted the vaccine got it or are about to get it soon (100% in my close circle), it's time to move on and make sure everyone gets theirs as fast as possible."
17666,Who?
17667,&gt;Cases and deaths are 3x what they were last summer!
17668,Got proof?
17669,"Hi, we have to remove this comment because we can't confirm you're actually a healthcare worker -- you can message modmail if you want to verify yourself!"
17670,"This could have been america ,"
17671,I always said you can't make stupidity against the law or half the people in most countries would be locked up.
17672,I got my ass handed to me by Pfizer #2 last night.
17673,Shit will be lit on 5/12 for me
17674,"Does this mean that once the pandemic is over, the flu will have so few current infections that it'll take a long time, maybe a few years, to become prevalent again?"
17675,Or do we expect to see it spike right back up like it does every year.
17676,[removed]
17677,What?
17678,What?
17679,Airborne means it spreads through tiny droplets.
17680,You contradict yourself from sentence to sentence.
17681,Yeah and we haven‚Äôt tested those mutations on the mRNA ones either.

17687,"I don't think anyone has plans to skip the second shot, but it does makes sense to make sure everyone gets their first shot before starting work on seconds, since the efficacy is so good after just 3 weeks with a single dose."
17688,:-(
17689,Cool story.
17690,But my OP said their kids do NOT have preexisting conditions but is still afraid to expose them.
17691,I took that to mean they're healthy.
17692,"So, I'm wondering if OP isn't comfortable now, when will they be?"
17693,[deleted]
17694,"Yeah, studies that didn't say as such before this pandemic."
17695,Ya know past flu studies only suggested ill people could wear a mask if they want to.
17696,So studies that conflict with the strictness of new studies just because they were done before this pandemic.
17697,Any ETA on full approval?
17698,I think the doctor said that to keep me calm until waiting for my next chance while I find someone more profound on the field whom I can consult with.
17699,"But yeah, even you say that I should consult so I guess she was right."
17700,"The allergy was from antibiotic pill containing small amount penicilin and i had trouble brearhing and got swollen, even lost conciusnes and woke up in the hospital, 3 years after i tested positive for penicilin allergy"

17705,Masks don't work against 5G.
17706,Try it with your phone.
17707,"Good question, maybe someone specialist in virology can explain us."
17708,"But by my interpretation, is that having a flu vacine, increase higiene, masks and self isolation measures had create a greater barrier for the transmissability of the flu virus."
17709,I might be wrong.

17719,Thats the response one normally gives when they know they have lost.

17726,The child had underlying health conditions.
17727,"&gt; When they realize you need one to travel they‚Äôll get it

Travel...where?"
17728,A huge amount of Americans do not travel outside of the US and I haven't heard any domestic airlines saying they will only accept vaccinated passengers either.
17729,"That would be highly unusual -- I'd recommend chatting to a doctor, it might be that you just got sick with something else."
17730,"&gt; west

Well happens in India too"
17731,Not at all worried.
17732,"There is absolutely no evidence this variant will be resistant to vaccines, and even if it was, total immune escape is completely unrealistic!"
17733,"My dumbass father is using this as ‚Äúproof‚Äù that hospitals are faking covid numbers to ‚Äúget more money.‚Äù   


According to him, most cases of covid are actually people with the flu, and there‚Äôs a huge conspiracy."
17734,"He doesn‚Äôt want to get vaccinated, because covid has been overblown."
17735,It's exactly like quitting your job any other time.
17736,"Tell whoever is in charge that you aren't coming back, and then leave."
17737,If you are wearing a mask and walking or jogging by yourself outside you deserve to be viciously mocked.
17738,Yeah I don‚Äôt think we should shut down any more.
17739,But people need to keep in mind that there‚Äôs still a risk to them and they should do easy and responsible things like masking in high risk situations and get vaccinated.

17747,"Good and bad, I imagine."
17748,I know a bunch of people getting married this year.
17749,It reminds me a lot of the year following the big Supreme Court ruling a few years back.
17750,well with flights coming in from India I wouldn't hold out hope this is going to happen.
17751,There have been no periods of zero local transmission in either country
17752,Crazy to imagine how more infectious COVID is compared to the flu.
17753,The vaccines are not perfect.
17754,They provide about 90% protection from infection if there is large community spread.
17755,But if everyone has a vaccine then covid cant spread and community spread vanishes.
17756,So your actual protection in this situation jumps to essentially 100%.
17757,How many German congressmen have been murdered by covid protestors in the last 1 1/2 years?
17758,The Netherlands: www.coronabeeld.nl - scroll down to the bottom for the government official plan they were supposed to start the group 50-60 years in May but they starred on Monday already taking bookings for the oldest in this group.

17760,That‚Äôs so true!
17761,I got the worst cold ever this year.
17762,Panicked at first.
17763,Then realized it was just a cold.
17764,Strange really...
17765,I have nothing against people wearing masks but the double standards really irk and amuse me.
17766,At the start they were saying ‚Äúthe CDC says we should wear masks!‚Äù Then I saw a comment in a NYC sub about it and someone said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll wait until the numbers indicate it‚Äôs safe.‚Äù *what!?
17767,* The CDC are lifting outdoor mask recommendations because it‚Äôs safe!

17777,"Iv talked with nurses in schools before and during the winter months its almost a daily occurrence that a kid is sick, parents give them some meds to hide the fever and send them off to school and they end up in the nurses office around 11-12."
17778,Slow vaccine rollout.
17779,Locked down hard which is great cause they had a small amount of cases.
17780,"However, that means there's virtually no herd immunity."
17781,"They'll likely have to stay isolated from the World longer than other countries or else they will become a ""plague pit"""

17784,"This doesn't surprise, all of my wife's family that still live in Mexico have been living and partying the whole time."
17785,We were surprised that they didn't contract COVID earlier.
17786,What now?
17787,Is this considered a means of transmission or is it just something that can happen?
17788,Of course this would happen in Germany.
17789,Lol.
17790,"This makes sense for a person, but not every person in every country."

17794,"Hey, does anyone have any insight into the weird disparity between vaccination rates and daily new case rates?"
17795,"Looking at covidactnow shows California as the state with the current lowest daily new case per 100,000 people rate at 4.7, and their 1+ vaccinated rate at 47.5%."
17796,"Meanwhile New Hampshire has the highest 1+ vaccinated rate at 59.7%, and the daily new cases per 100k is at 22.6, five times higher than California's."
17797,Is it really just due to weather?
17798,Wouldn't it be warm enough to not crowd inside anymore in the Northeast?
