10,We also don't know the long-term effects of a million different things that pregnant women put in their bodies.
11,Pretending like vaccines have these spooky long-term effects that don't surface for years is just nonsense.
12,I cannot imagine why this other information would be necessary.
13,The whole point here is to have a good enough solution.

15,Get out of here.

24,That’s just about the most easily solvable problem I have heard raised this whole pandemic.
25,You came here specifically to post that.
26,Just seems odd to complain about something that has saved countless lives in the last year.
27,"I don’t like wearing a mask, either, but to each his own."
28,"I don’t like pineapple on pizza, but I’m not going to assume those who do have problems."
29,"So we just give up and let the virus continue community spread among the unvaccinated, making it necessary for the whole population of responsible people to keep getting vaccinated every year?"
30,The end result of that is an inevitable slide in annual vaccination rates until we eventually get another pandemic of this magnitude.
31,We can’t let the vaccine holdouts destroy our future.
32,Everyone talks about their freedom but what about the freedom of the responsible and reasonable people to live in a world without worry of a preventable second pandemic?
33,If everyone in America was outfitted with a bomb with a random detonation time and the bomb set off a chair reaction to everyone else in the vicinity I don’t think we would worry so much about the freedom of people not to get the bombs disarmed.

36,We didn't do the 100 days of masks though.

38,It’s almost like... vaccines work?
39,"To be fair, we’re going into the warmer spring / summer months when cases went down last year too."
40,The real test will be this fall / winter... 😬
41,Trials are supposed to be blinded so it hurts the data to get an antibody test and act on it.
42,"Specifically, it would make the vaccines look bad since you'll start acting more riskily if it shows positive than negative."
43,"But yeah, the antibody test won't affect your immunity at all."
44,There aren't going to be safety measures when cases get to this level.
45,Deaths are far lower and obviously the expectations have changed from a year ago.
46,"Okay so like y'all know the big reason for masks in Asia is air pollution, right?"
47,It’s way higher: [Worldwide COVID-19 Total Death Cases By Country](https://youtu.be/GSpClXVmqzg)
48,"104,774,652 people were fully vaccinated as of Sunday."
49,They’ll be back to normal soon.
50,"All these anti-vaccination people who, ironically, are also opposed to lock downs better thank the pro-vaccine majority."
51,yeah at this point if people refuse to get the vaccine that’s their right but they have to accept the consequences
52,Different reaction to the vaccines are normal and do not mean anything

65,That's how this thing goes.
66,There's no free lunch.
67,Unless you can get 80% of your population to get vaccinated you're going to sustain a certain amount of cases on your way to herd immunity.
68,"Some did it earlier on, some will do it now."
69,Israel has 62% vaccinated.
70,The US is now at 44%.
71,"But we're also entering summer, and while there was a small surge last year during AC season, summer was mostly really easy."
72,It'll be next fall when we'll be fully reopened and will risk a surge among the unvaccinated population.

74,Any lab that can make it can get a license and support for basically nothing.
75,No
76,Any data to back this up?
77,Or just making stuff up?
78,1/3 of the entire population of PA is fully vaxxed.
79,I just got my two doses in different arms so the microchips can’t sync up.
80,Plus I allowed my temperature to get to 102 after the second dose which fried the chips.

96,It's quite high.
97,"yeah, that will last until sports venues, movie theaters, restaurants, etc start telling them they have to provide proof of vaccination."
98,First: exercise can be done anywhere.

105,I live in GA now but I have a few friends in CA that refuse to get the vaccine.
106,I know a few out here that refuse too.
107,None of these friends in either state know each other and most are liberals.
108,The only common trait I could find between them was they’re all in their twenties except one.
109,Everyone I know in their mid thirties on up has gotten both shots.
110,I know it’s anecdotal but it’s a weird pattern I noticed.
111,I figured I’d see refusal from people in Georgia but thought I’d see a lot less refusing in CA.
112,All of them give the same general reason that they’re young and aren’t worried about catching it.
113,I got my second dose last Thursday.

129,My wife also had no reaction and I had the worst headache of my life.
130,I do not think it has anything to do with your protection level however.
131,real world data is 90% and way more then 10% of people who take the shot have mild side effects
132,Thank you
133,"Proportionally, the United States would need to see 468 new cases in a day."
134,We saw around 100 times that yesterday.
135,What Israel has accomplished is amazing.

139,At least efficiently.
140,"Biologically, not necessarily legally."
141,Yeah that's good.
142,The side effects weren't fun but when I got the vaccine I didn't even realize he put it in me so until I started having problems I didn't realize he actually vaccinated me lol.
143,I feel for them but I’m not going to wait around for them.
144,They can take the necessary precautions but I’m not waiting out for a select few anymore.
145,Got the J&amp;J two days ago.
146,No side effects whatsoever.
147,"10/10 experience, pretty relieved and excited to be closer to not having to worry"
148,"Early 30s, was sick (fever, chills, aches, nausea, and diarrhea) for 4 days."

153,Oh no a terrovaxxor
154,You are reading WAY too much into this.
155,I am not presenting anything as fact.
156,I am wondering what the physiological difference is between taking NSIDs and analgesics prior to a vaccine as preventative and taking it after getting vaccinated as preventative.
157,Neither the literature or anythi g you have presented points to specifics to that point.
158,"If you have that info, please share it."
159,"Better yet if a trained medical professional can answer that, would be appreciated."
160,"In early January, they were averaging 8600 cases per day."
161,Now it's 72 cases per day.
162,"Israel, however, wouldn’t vaccinate people who had already had COVID, so there it’s natural immunity + vaccinations."
163,"Here in the US, you can get vaccinated even if you already had COVID, so there’s overlap, meaning less total immunity."
164,Stay strong.
165,That tiny sting is a small price to pay for salvation.
166,F them.
167,"We’ve done our part to mitigate the virus — if we need booster shots, then I’m happy to get them, they’ll be so commonplace that it won’t be a big deal, like getting my yearly flu shot."
168,"If they CHOOSE not to get the vaccine, and they get sick and possibly die?"
169,Then that’s on them.
170,As a NZer I'm glad to hear they're off the border.
171,Should they have been fired?
172,[Possibly not](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/441653/covid-19-unvaccinated-workers-fired-by-customs-should-be-compensated-advocate) - maybe they could have been relocated.
173,"However given we've had a number of issues with border workers / security guards at quarantine facilities, and there's a global pandemic it makes you wonder why you'd refuse a vaccine when you're at a reasonable risk of being exposed to Covid-19."
174,"Pfizer #2 this past Thursday and no side effects and very, very thankful"
175,They could fix distribution almost instantly by allowing labs outside the US to produce the vaccine.
176,Doesn’t require any donations.
177,They are holding this information hostage and shouldn’t be rewarded for it
178,I texted your response to my friend who grew up in trailer communities.
179,He said your opinion is trailer trash and I laughed.
180,[removed]
181,"Yeah after all the hate and mocking during our terrible initial covid response, now they come begging for our vaccines."
182,Good.
183,I think we well all need a booster shot
184,"That you chose to comment on lol, real genius 🤣"
185,That also shows the need for the J&amp;J one shot.
186,It makes those road shows much easier not only because it’s one and done but also due to the storage requirements
187,People who chose to get vaccinated have nothing to worry about because they are immune.
188,People who refuse to get vaccinated will not be immune and can get the virus and a small number will die and the rest will develop some natural immunity.
189,"well, there is a small segment of the population who physically cant get vaccinated because of allergies or issues with their immune systems, so holdouts are fucking things up for those folks too"
190,what is the reason for the delay?
191,", honestly i just thought the us were assholes and wanted to keep a complete set of vaccines for themselves while share pfizer with others , as a person who did register since january and still didnt get the vaccine , f the WHO"
192,"Upvo—

193,I'm talking about Texans vacationing in MA.

225,You can't compare a country as small as vietnam and with a population difference greater than 200 million is just ignorant.

227,What's the population density difference between america and vietnam if you know so much?
228,"And if you know so much you would understand pop density plays a big role, not to mention population in general, we have almost fives times Vietnam population but you seem to think the two are similar enough to compare."

234,Do they think that is going to help?
235,My whole state will not make it to 50%.
236,Covid will remain at background levels until immunity from the vaccine and natural infection starts to wear off.
237,"Every time a new booster shot is required to keep immunity strong, less of that 50% who got fully vaccinated this first time around will receive the boosters."
238,In 5 to 10 years once community levels of protection fall below a certain point Covid will come back.
239,Seems like health insurance companies at some point should tack on an extra premium if policy holders don't get vaccinated.
240,That would show up on employer's insurance programs and employee's co-pays.
241,"If people don't want to be vaccinated, fine."
242,But the cost of being unvaccinated should no longer be socialized among the immunized.
243,Yeah definitely.
244,"My zip code in south Seattle had 67% at their first dose as of… whenever I checked, a few days ago."
245,Even goddamn Vashon was at 75%!
246,Bill Gates used his money to set up a parallel structure inside the WHO to protect pharma IP from waivers and other trade agreements that would allow other countries to manufacture the vaccines.
247,"He’s directly responsible for untold deaths that could’ve been prevented with vaccinations, all for the sake of making more money for people like himself, who are already rich beyond all imagination."

249,On the one hand - if it were initial reports of a new to us variant without any detail on if the vaccine is effective?
250,"Sure, hunker down for a bit before they figure out how effective our vaccines are vs. the variant."
251,"If it's effective go about your day, if not then take reasonable precaution."
252,That's pretty logical.
253,On the other hand - US media is being over aggressive about variants and needs to chill.
254,The CDC needs to tweak their messaging so that it's less ambiguous/spinable (even though that is kinda counter to their role).
255,I hate this particularly because I have had an unusual period after my first vaccine dose (my period started the day before I got the vaccine and it hasn't stopped since.
256,It was lighter than normal and has gradually gotten heavier.
257,It'll be three full weeks on Wednesday 😩) and I feel like I can't actually talk to others /seek out advice without sounding like a nut!

271,I am well aware that both are a factor here.
272,But which one would you say is more impactful?
273,"After all, even if the Japanese government were 100% competent (which no government is) there is a limit to how many vaccines it can get at once."
274,[deleted]
275,I guess I've just noticed a shift.
276,"I used to see more 'America, we're worried about you' from non-Americans."
277,"Now it's seems more predominant to have Americans saying, 'oh shit, you have these insanely disinformed people in your country, too?!'"
278,Three week?
279,You mean a year right?
280,You been under a rock or something
281,"I don’t know what’s scarier - the fact that the government is effectively forcing people to get vaccines, or the fact that redditors are actually happy about this."
282,They rarely wear masks where I live.
283,Mine made me wait 15min after the dose to check if any reaction was occurring
284,The only way to avoid that problem is to make the vaccine compulsory.
285,"I hate to say it, but if there are people who are able to get the vaccine and choose not to, that's just reality."
286,They've chosen to potentially harm or kill those who are unable to protect themselves.

294,"That's what we're predominantly using for our mobile programs, which include non-captive migratory populations (homeless, undocumented, etc)."
295,J&amp;J is the correct shot for a lot of communities.
296,I'm hoping he announces something like an end to the mask mandate once 70% of adults are vaccinated or something akin to that.
297,Something that gives everyone a solid concrete number to work towards with a tangible reward at the end of it.
298,Guarantee it'll get a few people on the fence to go and get vaccinated.
299,I got my second shot last week and it's been such a relief.
300,A week after that I'll go to visit some family and such that's been fully vaccinated.
301,I can't wait.
302,"Vaccines are not 100% effective, and not everyone is vaccinated yet."
303,I remember when trump said we couldn't afford to destroy the economy and supply chains by issuing a strict indefinite federal lockdown and reddit went insane with rage.

311,My parents who are almost fully vaccinated are now scared that they'll get the indian virus somehow (in the USA) even though it's protected under our vaccine... Now they are scared to never leave the house.
312,It's too much.
313,[removed]
314,You say that but rural India is getting hammered right now.
315,I really do think the more rural parts of the South could get hammered if one of the more infectious variants gains a foothold.

317,"It was inevitable, but sad."
318,I'm glad all of my state's immediate neighbors are still in the happy side of this chart.
319,They can just use temporary travel restrictions on that area.
320,It’s not necessary to do a full lockdown everywhere.
321,Just limit travel in and out of the hard hit areas and vaccinate everyone.
322,"People who live outside of the hotspots don’t need restrictions, aside from maybe travel."

334,I agree to your statement mostly but with these two cases one of which will get vaccinated but one will never...

343,"In the US, unfortunately, partisan ideology is the greatest predictor of how seriously someone takes COVID and adhere to mitigation measures."
344,"And in the current political landscape, the vast majority of police officers, have gone from leaning right to being fully dug in, with the whole castle and moat."
345,So it's completely unsurprising that US police have a relatively low COVID vaccination rate.
346,Mandating it is one way to go.

348,I'd be interested to know how Hawaii got such a high vaccination rate (80%!)

376,Maybe true.
377,I wish we could know the demographics of reddit without confessing anything personal.
378,Right but if the question is “when are you fully vaccinated?” then the answer is 2 weeks after the 2nd dose (according to the CDC)
379,And Ironically opening dates are completely flipped haha.
380,MA isn't set to open until 8/1 with Boston around Labor Day while the south is already open.
381,Maybe they push it forward in MA but Boston has made it pretty clear they are not opening until 3 weeks after the rest of the state.
382,Given NYC making the Gov.
383,look pretty dumb I expect the state to move to 7/1 which means late July for Boston.
384,Good for the strategy buuut there's also a political reason behind that.

601,"True, but surveillance data didn't show it being very widespread outside of the most densely populated parts of the East Coast."
602,"Fewer deaths now despite lower cases in the first wave is likely reflective of the increased testing capacity, but likely also has to do with lower viral loads among those transmitting and masks and distancing reducing that even further along with some treatment progress."
603,"Nevertheless even now only a minority of actual cases are ever detected and reported as the CDC is still estimating around 4-5 unreported cases for each reported, largely because half or more of cases are completely asymptomatic."

955,*
956,The 1 in 14 is with 2 doses.
957,(1 billion / 2) / 7 billion = 1 / 14.
958,"Given that the first dose also gives a lot of immunity, I’d argue that less than 1/14 are fully vaccinated, but more than that have pretty good protection."
959,Only vaccinated people are allowed on the street.
960,So get vaccinated.
961,"Sweden donates one million Astra doses to Covax

Sweden now plans to donate one million doses of Astra Zeneca's corona vaccine to Covax, the international collaboration to help with the urgent need for vaccines worldwide."
962,This news was announced by Minister for Development Aid Per Olsson Fridh (MP) in SVT's Morgonstudion on Monday.
963,"- We need to do everything we can to meet this pandemic, he says."
964,"Due to the very serious situation in India, vaccine deliveries to the global Covax vaccine collaboration have been delayed."
965,That is why Sweden is now donating one million doses to the international initiative that will deliver vaccines against covid-19 to low-income countries free of charge.
966,- We see how the pandemic is raging around the world.
967,"People are dying, poverty is spreading and children are still not back in school."
968,"We need to do everything we can to meet this pandemic, and fight it all over the world, says Minister for Development Aid Per Olsson Fridh in Morgonstudion."
969,"He believes that it is not time to ""sit and hold doses""."
970,And the Minister for Development Aid has previously said that he wants Sweden to donate vaccines as soon as Swedish risk groups have been vaccinated.
971,"- Sweden is already a leading financier in the Covax collaboration, but what we do now is that we also go in with a million doses to ensure that more people in the world can get vaccines quickly."
972,"Does not affect Sweden's vaccination rate
Just like the money donated so far for the collaboration, the vaccine donation is financed from the development assistance budget."
973,Per Olsson Fridh also says that there may be more donations later.
974,To which countries the doses will be sent is currently unclear.
975,"There are 92 aid-financed countries that receive vaccines through Covax, and it is the World Health Organization, WHO, and Covax that I decide in detail which countries will receive them."
976,"The fact that Sweden now donates Astra vaccines does not affect the national vaccination work, according to Sweden's vaccine coordinator Richard Bergström."
977,"- We have received Astra Zeneca until they are over 65 now, most recently, and in the coming weeks we will take the necessary doses to get it done, and have a dose of two for those who need it, says Bergström in Morgonstudion."
978,"- And this is a million, we actually have four or five more, of Astra Zenecas vaccines that we can share later."
979,[deleted]
980,"No one wants it, but somebody gets it."
981,&gt; Hopefully they lower that with more data from Germany and other EU countries.
982,"Honestly, the German decision to not restrict age seems inconsistent."
983,I wouldn't be surprised if Germany were to increase the age limit as more data is collected.
984,[removed]
985,&gt; Like the supplied vaccines differed significantly to samples submitted during negotiations.
986,"If you say it with such confidence , you won't have any trouble listing these differences, will you?"
987,I’m a grocery store worker and honestly it’s not a big deal.
988,Never had to deal with abusive customers and just do the same work I’d do with or without a pandemic.
989,It’s not really made any difference.
990,How much money a doctor makes on average working for NHS?
991,"It's true, being vaccinated is a science experiment, but so is life."
992,Yeah.
993,I just got vaccinated and can confirm.
994,Anyone else really like Bing lately?
995,"(/s, for people who can't read sarcasm."
996,Get vaccinated.)
997,"Lol, I don't even know why you have so much time to argue over such a pedantic point like ""China Weibo mocks India"" vs ""China mocks India"" and then making assumptions about me projecting."
998,"And yes, this was an inappropriate and vile post made by an employee who was likely reprimanded."
999,Seems like you're the one with the agenda.
1000,Everyone.
1001,Open it up.
1002,Epeen's not a word
1003,Makes sense

1006,*
1007,I don't think lackluster is the right word.
1008,Most of the vaccinations have happened in the last month and a half.
1009,"Is it possible that a person could be hesitant about accepting the unknown, long term effects of the vaccine without being a conspiracy theorist?"
1010,Forgive us for not wanting to be welded into our homes.
1011,"What the western world has gone through has been a disaster, I would take a disaster over living under CCP rule any day."
1012,Our freedoms aren't free.
1013,"&gt;I’ve been seeing a lot of chatter on   
&gt;  
&gt;r/Australia  
&gt;  
&gt; saying a good amount of people don’t want AZ."
1014,Partially because of its reputation and also because of the lack of Covid.
1015,*Seriously?
1016,"* To me, it feels like it's still needed for extra protection."
1017,"Covid is not afraid on striking back, even if one of the few countries got the whole thing all under control."
1018,"Speaking as a grocery store worker, thanks for thinking of us, but we don't have the stress of anyone's lives being in our hands."
1019,"Bless Healthcare, the front line of this awful fighting."
1020,"Wait, you mean people in the US aren't out there protesting over Canada's restrictions?"
1021,;)
1022,The 7 days average of Germany is much lower than 1 million.
1023,"Speed is pretty much the same across every European countries, the small differences are explained by slightly different strategies (like France did not increase the second dose delay retroactively)."
1024,"Italy is doing good, things are going to be OK :)"
1025,50%?
1026,Do you have a source for that?
1027,[deleted]
1028,Scotland has said that they're going to address moving down from level 0 possibly in July but can't put a specific date on it yet because it's too many months out.
1029,Suggesting they're keeping it for the rest of the year is an outright falsehood.
1030,"&gt;Nicola Sturgeon has laid out a series of dates for Scotland to move through all of the lockdown levels, that could see the country leave level zero by July."
1031,"https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.edinburghlive.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/lockdown-dates-nicola-sturgeon-announced-20424882.amp

And honestly if people are holding ""anti lockdown"" protests over requests for increased hand washing and giving people a bit of extra space in shops then they're going to look like idiots."
1032,"""China weibo post mocks India"" is not the same as ""China mocks India""."
1033,So that seems like projection on your part.
1034,Maybe that's why you took such offense to this post?
1035,"If an official account from the US posted something bad about India or China, would you have the same reaction?"
1036,"Stuff like this deserves to be highlighted to keep people honest, no?"
1037,"You agree it's a vile post, right?"
1038,I won't disagree with you on the grade-school catfighting on reddit.
1039,It is what it is unfortunately since there are so many segregated subs echo-chambering their truth and riling each other up.
1040,[deleted]
1041,1.
1042,I think your premise that some individuals not vaccinating endangers our society as a whole is mistaken.
1043,The vaccines seem to protect very effectively against severe COVID (ICU / Death).
1044,"However, there is limited evidence it also prevents the spread of the virus."
1045,"In addition, there is evidence of a continuous human-animal vector of spread."
1046,Even 100% vaccination is not going to stop the spread of the virus.
1047,2.
1048,You should always be concerned about a slippery slope since our history is full of examples where laws and regulations with good intentions are used against the general population.
1049,See for example [how the Patriot Act was invoked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversial_invocations_of_the_Patriot_Act).
1050,Good laws have clauses that protect the law from extending its reach.
1051,3.
1052,The kind of companies providing these digital passports will be more like Equifax with B2B and B2G interactions.
1053,There is a good buck to be made to provide safety information on people using digital certificates.
1054,I hope you're right and this new variant isn't more reisstent to the vaccine.
1055,I just don't generally have high hopes when it comes to these things working out
1056,"But we’re still averaging 50k cases per day, there are other countries that haven’t had that many cases in the lifetime of the pandemic, like Japan, Australia, Singapore, etc."
1057,Who?
1058,Give who the IP?
1059,This strawman argument of factories has nothing to do with giving them the IP.
1060,Give them the IP we paid for with our tax dollars.
1061,Done.
1062,Maybe you could refute my point instead of just saying grow up
1063,This post appears to be about vaccines.

1098,What happens in the UK for the rest of the year doesn't have any bearing on anti lockdown protests in Cork
1099,Yes.
1100,Obviously.
1101,Neighbouring countries are going to have rules for the rest of the year.
1102,The question is which data the data processing entity needs to provide for the service of a vaccine passport.
1103,1.
1104,Medical exemption needs to be recorded somehow.
1105,"For example, to prevent data quality issues or to link the passport to the right healthcare provider."
1106,"Also, for auditing."
1107,2.
1108,SSN: you need to properly identify each person when making changes.
1109,DOB and name are not enough to uniquely identify a person.
1110,3.
1111,Healthcare provider: you retrieve information from each healthcare provider in order to record it on the passport.
1112,"So, there is at least a one-way link which will be recorded for auditing purposes."
1113,"So, even though this information is not presented in the passport, it is most likely needed to create the passport and keep it up-to-date."
1114,I am looking at the data processing as a whole and all the actors involved.
1115,But the real question you should have is in the mandate.
1116,Are the new laws and regulations mandating **only** the use for COVID-19 vaccinations?
1117,And which precedent does it set?
1118,"The situation is just a tiny bit different in the US though, to say the least."
1119,You’re talking about a country that contained it vs the country where hundreds are still still dying every day.
1120,"real mature, china."
1121,no wonder you still claim yourself a third world country.
1122,Isn't it important to highlight bad things that are being said about India and Indians?
1123,Or should this be kept quiet because it's coming from China?
1124,I won't be surprised if they start studying cross-species immunity.

1256,&gt; I think this is mostly a way to reunite some families who have been unable to see each other for over a year now.
1257,Precisely my situation.
1258,I haven't seen my family since November of 2019 so this is a godsend for me.
1259,???
1260,"I was just wondering why a post about India was tagged as USA...looks like I was right to wonder, as it’s been changed."
1261,Not sure wtf you’re on about.
1262,[deleted]
1263,Yeah that is the one that is the most surprising.
1264,"Article obviously promoted to get everyone riled up against the police, but I've heard quite a few anti vaxers turn to the ""only 50 percent of people in the medical field will get this""."
1265,"Early herd immunity estimates were assuming it had droplet transmission (and that while symptomatic), meaning it mostly spread in close contact networks."
1266,"It's actually aerosol / ""airborne"" and so one can infect people in general proximity."
1267,"More efficiently airborne than flu, as seen from the swift demise of flu whenever COVID mitigation is used."
1268,This is much harder to stop.
1269,Seriously China has the largest and fastest growing middle class in the world.
1270,The largest economy in the world when adjusted for PPP.
1271,They are a force to be reckoned with and that terrifies the US.
1272,"Yeah, it would have to be pfizer."
1273,It looks like they don't have moderna.
1274,If she were lucky enough to get the j&amp;j vaccine she'd be all set.
1275,They also are doing AstraZeneca so we would prob say no to that.
1276,I'm more concerned about her having to prove that she got one dose internationally.
1277,Also Regarding the bio-security rule of 14 day outside India before can come to australia-Or risk jail/fine-a few other countries have that 14 day temporary bio-security rule as well i.e Hong Kong / Singapore - but I don't know how they enforce/police it ?
1278,( I don't think they have jail/fine ?
1279,Is oz the only one?)
1280,This type of article bothers me.
1281,"First, where is factoring in existing cases?"
1282,"Yes variants exist, but why not even acknowledge those numbers?"
1283,"Second, the media complains people don't want to get vaccinated, but they spent how long reporting on JNJ and how it has insanely rare blood clots?"
1284,"They fear monger that, government pulls it for a bit, which only makes people on the fence solidify their view not to get the vaccine."
1285,"Now, they're just basically reporting this BS defeatism."
1286,REPORT THE GOOD NEWS.
1287,I swear to God people want the worst to happen and for this to never end.
1288,I don’t really get it.
1289,All they’re saying is that eradication is impossible.
1290,No shit.
1291,No one has said it wasn’t.
1292,"We still get measles outbreaks yearly, but herd immunity hinders them from becoming epidemic."
1293,Israeli transimission rates are basically down to 0 with only 60% vaccinated.
1294,Isn’t that what we considered the best-case scenario just a few months ago?
1295,Gotta keep us scared and clicking

1298,Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) if you have any questions or concerns.
1299,*
1300,I hope the production will start soon and a new vaccine can be administrated.
1301,Turkey currently uses Biontech-phizer and Sinovac which is not sufficient so far.
1302,"If most of europe holds out with only using AZ on over 60s then I suspect we will soon start seeing a flurry of these announcements across europe, given it's not too long until these groups are done."
1303,"After all, you gain nothing from just sitting on a lifesaving vaccine that you don't intend to use."
1304,Donating to COVAX is an easy way to do it as well.
1305,Will it be the same brand in both countries?
1306,?
1307,[removed]
1308,"You're the only one using the, ""eradication"" word here."
1309,With everyone vaccinated the amount of virus still circulating would be minimal.
1310,"Polio isn't eradicated either, but it's also not a big threat."
1311,As soon as we learned we had a 90% effective vaccine it should have became clear that the goal was to make this virus irrelevant.
1312,Yea but that doesn’t happen in real life
1313,So you are saying its a perfect headline for Reddit
1314,"Horrendous article, in my opinion."
1315,"It isn't factually inaccurate or anything like that, but it CLEARLY cherrypicks quotes from a bunch of different sources in an effort to make current ""consensus"" among scientists seem far more pessimistic than it actually is."
1316,"In reality, whether it is Gottlieb, Fauci, or now even Walensky, a big cohort of prominent voices is very encouraged that current vaccination levels should drive big drops in numbers this summer and make this deadly disease far more manageable."
1317,Is COVID going to disappear?
1318,Of course not...I'm not aware of any medical voice who has ever thought that it will.
1319,"But it is irresponsible to suggest that the vaccination effort to date has been anything but successful, as total national protection (including from prior infection) is now north of 60%."
1320,"The NYTs is free to write whatever it wants, but the United States has clearly rounded the corner in its pandemic journey and it would be much better for national morale if they acknowledged it."
1321,LOL didn't even think to see it that way.
1322,"Also, always look for an excuse to watch more Jude Law, even if he's the bad guy."
1323,My sister is 13 with an autoimmune disorder.
1324,"Everyone in our immediate family has received both shots (though some of us recently, so they’re not “fully vaccinated” for another week or so), and more and more people around us are being vaccinated."
1325,Feels like we’re forming a nice little shield around her until Pfizer/Moderna gets approved for 12-15.
1326,Feels good man.
1327,You cant believe the nation with the most people will give the most vaccine.
1328,Also the Chinese are literally known for their manufacturing.
1329,They used more concrete in 5 years than the US used in 100 years.
1330,Ugh.
1331,Yeah.
1332,That explains it.
1333,It is on the menu.
1334,It's literally right there.
1335,"If we weren't in such a selfish, stupid country in part, we'd be sailing across the finish line."
1336,The smart people figured it out.
1337,The wealth granted us massive privileges and a place at a head of the table.
1338,"But too many of just won't eat, because of utterly stupid, illogical reasons."
1339,"Yes, we are going to have to accept that reality, and I feel quite bad for people who cannot take the vaccine and live in areas where uptake is very low."
1340,"There will be collateral damage from this, and risks are unknown."
1341,"So yeah, well have to accept it."
1342,But the fact that a critical mass of people cannot recognize the value in a vaccine during a pandemic doesn't speak highly of us.
1343,"Ok, but that means little."
1344,Only a handful of people in the control groups died of COVID.
1345,"Your confidence interval on that ""100%"" number is huge making it meaningless."
1346,"TIL, kidnapping people at the border is bad for cooperation."
1347,[removed]
1348,"Why bother, if you can make the Pfizer vaccine ,moderna had already given permission to make theirs."
1349,"Nobody can just mass produce vaccines like that though, it takes time to build the factories."
1350,Of you have a lab you can make a few doses in a week.
1351,[deleted]
1352,"&gt; factually incorrect for companies to be using the ""100%"" number."
1353,The results of the Phase 3 clinical trials are factually correct.
1354,The results were 100%.
1355,"The sentence is in past tense (""was"")."
1356,It is not an indicator of future performance at scale.
1357,That's why we're still measuring.
1358,Haven't you guys had a pretty wet winter?
1359,Gotta imagine it won't be quite as bad this year.
1360,You must be living in a really HIGH cost of living location.
1361,"I've been able to do what your dad is doing, having paid off college loans and eliminated home mortgage."
1362,"I only have 1 wife, 2 kids and a dog though."
1363,"I also choose to live in a low cost of living city, where real estate and rent is a pittance compared to places like NYC and SFO."
1364,There is no way I would have signed up for 4 kids nowadays.
1365,"One big difference between nowadays and the good ol' days is that I also feel like people have much more ""stuff"" to support."
1366,"Every household feels the need to:

* Go on expensive vacations
* Own two or more flat-screen TVs
* Own the latest Phone, gaming PC, console, etc."
1367,"* Own 2 or more cars, RVs, Jetskis etc
* Pay for college degrees that may not ever have a chance of getting an ROI."
1368,"Having spoken with my own parents and grandparents, I realize that such expectations were unheard of back in the day."
1369,There are a lot of people talking about their side effects and probably not enough people who didn't have (bad) side effects speaking up.
1370,At least in my experience with social media.
1371,So: I had my second Moderna dose on Thursday.
1372,"The worst was a sore arm (not painful, just didn't want to lean on it) and a pressure headache."
1373,"Took one paracetamol, slept it off and the next day was back on my feet like normal."
1374,Barely noticed it.
1375,"Covid can get in without it

Could they not send it the same way?"
1376,"Except it has, several times."
1377,[removed]
1378,"If the US doesn't approve vaccines to people 12-15 before July, some countries in the EU might actually surpass them in first doses"
1379,Parents are probably sending covid positive kids to school.
1380,I feel we still don't know enough about long term health impact on kids (especially unvaccinated) not smart at all.

1382,"SF Bay Area, in one of the most unaffordable cities in the country."
1383,Woo.

1387,"There is definitely a shortage in IT, a lot of tech companies hire workers from overseas as they can't find enough talent locally."
1388,Guys!
1389,"I know I’m not living in the us (Germany here) and what I’m saying has nothing to do with the article, but I got vaxed!!!"
1390,I’m sitting right now in the lobby waiting 15 minutes (in case something would happen) and I’m so happy about it.
1391,It’s amazing that feeling that things might get better.
1392,Thank you science and thank you to everyone who believed in science.
1393,Can you explain to me the problem with “live with it”?
1394,You seem to find that pretty bad and I genuinely don’t understand.
1395,Accepting that Covid is a thing now and resuming our normal lives strikes me as the only sensible thing to do.
1396,"I genuinely don’t see the problem with letting the few people who still have a bad reaction to Covid get the treatment they need (and sometimes, yes, die of it) while normal life just marches on, same as with any other disease or medical problem."
1397,What alternative could there possibly be?
1398,Eradication is clearly not on the menu.
1399,"I totally get that in cities like SFO, or NYC."
1400,Honestly this is why I live in Cleveland (despite our lousy winters).
1401,"I get all of the big city amenities I need, yet the cost of living is dramatically lower than that of my colleagues in the large cities."
1402,"My I ask, where are you living that the cost of living is so high?"
1403,I get the gesture but it's not really possible to do anything in my country (Netherlands).
1404,"You can go to the zoo and see the same animals you can see in a zoo closer to home, I guess."
1405,Or you can book a seat at an outdoor café and drink a beer in the cold wind (hope it doesn't rain!).
1406,But there's really no museums to see.
1407,"You still need a PCR test to enter the country, vaccinated or not."
1408,In summary: please don't come yet.
1409,"Every adult hasn't been given the chance to be vaccinated yet, you're not going to get any sympathy if you try to take liberties because you're vaccinated, etc."
1410,"I think this is mostly a way to reunite some families who have been unable to see each other for over a year now, but it's still not the time for us to think about international travel yet."

1412,"&gt; The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recorded 182,874 wasted doses as of late March, three months into the country's effort to vaccinate the masses against the coronavirus."
1413,"CVS was responsible for nearly half, and Walgreens was responsible for 21 percent, or nearly 128,500 wasted shots combined."
1414,"If that's all that's been wasted out of over 200 million shots given, I can live with it."
1415,It's a fraction of a percent.
1416,The only issue I see is that most of the waste occurred early in the vaccination process when vaccines had extremely limited availability.
1417,&gt;Turkey gets its third vaccine from Russia.
1418,"After the \[joyful news of the\] first 50 million doses of vaccine given by the Minister of Health Fahrettin Koca the previous day, the production of Sputnik V, developed by the Russian Gamelia Institute, will now be made in Turkey."
1419,"&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The factory of CinneGen, which is shown as the largest biotechnological pharmaceutical company in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), was established in Çerkezköy Organized Industrial Zone with an investment of 30 million Euros 4 years ago in Turkey, in fact, it was opened in 2019 to produce monoclonal antibodies against cancer."
1420,"&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;In the first months of 2020, CinnaGen İlaç co-founder and CEO Ferhat Farsi said that they have also managed to obtain the internationally recognized GMP (Good Manifacturing Practice) certificate from the Ministry of Health that it can produce at world standards, and said that they shared a similar fate with Uğur Şahin."
1421,"&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;""WE LIVED THE SAME FATE WITH UĞUR ŞAHİN""  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Farsi said:  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;\* In fact, we are a 30-year-old biotech company."
1422,We started our activities in Turkey in 2016 and this factory was opened in June 2019.
1423,We essentially made all our preparations for the production of the first monoclonal antibodies in Turkey.
1424,We have a (R&amp;D) team of 50 people.
1425,"&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;\* They received serious training on biotechnological products for 2 years both domestically and abroad."
1426,"In fact, I compare the process we came to very much with what my teacher Uğur Şahin went through."
1427,Because our teacher Uğur would also use the mRNA platform for cancer treatment.
1428,"&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;\* But after the covid pandemic, he had to channel this platform to the covid vaccine."
1429,We prepared ourselves especially for the production of monoclonal antibodies in cancer treatment.
1430,"&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;\* Monoclinal antibodies in biotechnology are actually more complex molecules compared to vaccines."
1431,"In other words, while we were preparing for higher technology and production, the vaccine entered our agenda with the pandemic."
1432,"&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;""NOT FILLING, WE WILL PRODUCE ZERO VACCINE \[PRODUCE VACCINE FROM SCRATCH\]""  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Farsi underlined that vaccine production will be made from scratch, not ""vaccine filling"", in the facility whose GMP certification has been completed, and said, ""It is worth mentioning that we will carry out the whole production process of the vaccine in Turkey from A to Z in these facilities."
1433,I am really proud of this on behalf of my company.
1434,"Because we will make an extremely complex production in Turkey using bioreactors from A to Z, including the master cell line."
1435,"In other words, this is not a vaccine filling activity, I want to specifically mention."
1436,We are talking about a vector-based adenovirus vaccine.
1437,"It is one of the first 3 vaccines in the world that has been prepared and developed with extremely high technology and has an extremely high reliability and efficiency, with an efficiency of more than 90 percent."
1438,"We are proud to produce this vaccine in Turkey, which received the first license in the world in Covid 19, ”he said."
1439,"&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;""WE HAVE THE VACCINE PRODUCTION CERTIFICATE IN WORLD STANDARDS""  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Stating that, towards the end of 2020, the GMP certification application they made to the Ministry of Health during the beginning of the pandemic was finalized and they managed to obtain the internationally valid document, which means to produce at world standards, Farsi said, “This is a document required for the production of biotech products."
1440,"After that, after adapting ourselves to vaccine production, we applied to the Ministry of Health again and after various inspections, this time additional certification was made for vaccine production."
1441,"Later, we applied again specifically for the product specific, that is, the Sputnik vaccine."
1442,"In him, a GMP certification was added specifically for the product, that is, for the product, ”he said."
1443,"&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;""YOU MUST HAVE THE SAME TECHNOLOGY WITH THE VACCINE DEVELOPERS""  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Pointing out that the vaccine was developed in Russia by the state-sponsored Gamelya Institute, Ferhat Farsi continued his words as follows:  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;\* 130 years of serious institute."
1444,It is a serious institution that has its signature in very innovative vaccines.
1445,It was very important to be able to speak the same language as the technology provider (they) and the company that bought the technology (CinnaGen).
1446,It was very important to have the same technology.
1447,Russian officials also came here last March.
1448,"&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;\* Seeing the facility, seeing the qualification of our staff, they were sure of everything and wanted to start the processes for production as soon as possible."
1449,"After that, things got faster."
1450,We carried out the technology transfer of the vaccine.
1451,"&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;\* In this technology transfer, you receive the entire production process of the vaccine and all documentation regarding quality control."
1452,"More importantly, we acquired the master cell line, which we can call the ""heart of the vaccine"" in vaccine production."
1453,We also received the virus seeds needed to produce the adenovirus vaccine.
1454,"&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;ONE OF THE WORLD'S SAFE VACCINE TECHNOLOGIES  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Stating that adenovirus vaccines are a well-known technology, Farsi emphasized that this vaccine technology has been used since 1953 and that Sputnik V was also created with this method."
1455,"Farsi provided the following information:  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;\* Use of these extremely safe adenoviruses (in vaccines)."
1456,"Viruses (vector) that do not cause any disease in humans, an important and immune response of the coronavirus occurs."

1462,No one likes the CCP.
1463,"Strictly on COVID control though, the Chinese are now mostly back to normal with no excessive casualties."

1481,100% agree.
1482,Oregon consistently ranked terribly in % of doses utilized.
1483,"I hope we’ll catch up with comparable states eventually, but I’m concerned."
1484,Some mostly baseless speculation: the lethargic roll out has given anti-vax propaganda more time to sink in.

1530,Other issues came up during his time in ICU.
1531,They nurse was very nice but you could see she was visibly upset they were pushing him through and to make way for GTA people coming in.
1532,&gt;I doubt the CDC will even approve the vaccines for kids.
1533,Pfizer submitted an EUA application for kids 12-15 a month ago and it's expected to be approved in a few weeks.
1534,They're preparing to submit one for kids 5-11 as soon as that happens and that one is expected to be approved by year end.
1535,Clinical trials with kids as young as 6 months are already underway.
1536,"Now, it's possible they may never get approved for kids under 5 due to a different risk/benefit calculus for non school age kids, but vaccines for kids 5+ are definitely coming."
1537,Can they criticize their government?
1538,"It's 2 months away top, relax"

1586,Having her vaccinated will make me a whole lot happier.

1612,"Hey, Michael!"
1613,Next do climate crisis!
1614,This article title feels like MORE fear mongering.
1615,"What I can gather is that Fauci in the article stated that, ""“People were getting confused and thinking you’re never going to get the infections down until you reach this mystical level of herd immunity, whatever that number is,” he said."
1616,"“That’s why we stopped using herd immunity in the classic sense,” he added."
1617,“I’m saying: Forget that for a second.
1618,"You vaccinate enough people, the infections are going to go down.”

So we shouldn't focus on a magic uncertain number, but try to get as many people vaccinated anyways."
1619,This virus was never going to go away once it broke out the gate and the best we can do is eventually either vaccinate or get infected.
1620,They're saying a theoretical 30% of people with vaccine hesitancy will stop us from reaching a brand new increased goal of 80% (up from their previous 50-60%) herd immunity.
1621,"But there's no solid data on if these numbers are absolute, as we haven't opened to children and if the vaccines get FDA approval and not just EUA, then more workplaces, and schools can mandate the vaccine."
1622,"And even if they don't, much like the 1918 flu it'll either spread through the community or vaccination and lose its Novel Virus status."
1623,"“We will not achieve herd immunity as a country or a state or even as a city until we have enough immunity in the population as a whole,” said Lauren Ancel Meyers, the director of the Covid-19 Modeling Consortium at the University of Texas at Austin."""
1624,"All I can say is, no shit."
1625,They are declaring failure that even if we reach the goal nationally we failed because some bubble pocket in the middle of nowhere can't reach a high percent like say a city or California.
1626,"""If the herd immunity threshold is not attainable, what matters most is the rate of hospitalizations and deaths after pandemic restrictions are relaxed, experts believe[....]""What we want to do at the very least is get to a point where we have just really sporadic little flare-ups,” said Carl Bergstrom, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Washington in Seattle."
1627,"“That would be a very sensible target in this country where we have an excellent vaccine and the ability to deliver it.” 

This has always been the goal, eradication is way too lofty and near impossible now."
1628,"We might not reach herd immunity through vaccination, but it will go through communities anyway."
1629,"In summary, I think hope is not lost and we should encourage and drive the vaccine effort to reach out to everyone in their community in a way that best fits them."
1630,My nephew’s wife has CF and lost her two siblings to it when she was younger.

1644,I wish there was a way we could find this out as well.
1645,I'm pretty sure there's more causality between people who are skeptical and getting the vaccine than there is with people who are staunchly anti-vax and getting it.
1646,"Problem is, anyone who is skeptical is labeled anti-vax."
1647,That's bad messaging.
1648,"I'm a skeptic, but I still got the vaccine."
1649,"I'm even more skeptical of the efficacy of masks, but I'm a pretty ardent mask wearer (up until I was completely vaccinated and my state's mask order was dropped."
1650,"If a business wants to allow me in without a mask, and I'm completely vaccinated, I see no reason to wear a mask)."

1683,Question
1684,"yeah, I know."
1685,"I've been super safe this whole pandemic, I just want to ditch that 2nd mask... really masks all together"
1686,"According to the article the Gates Foundation did that in order to increase AZ chances to bring the vaccine to market, not to quash it as open source:

“We went to Oxford and said, Hey, you’re doing brilliant work,” Bill Gates told reporters on June 3, a transcript shows."
1687,“But … you really need to team up.” The comments were first reported by Bloomberg.
1688,"AstraZeneca, one of the U.K.’s two major pharma companies, may have demanded an exclusive license in return for doing a deal, said Ken Shadlen, a professor at the London School of Economics and an authority on pharma patents—a theory supported by comments from CEO Soriot."
1689,"“I think IP [intellectual property, or exclusive patents] is a fundamental part of our industry and if you don’t protect IP, then essentially there is no incentive for anybody to innovate,” Soriot told the newspaper The Telegraph in May."
1690,"Some see the Gates Foundation, a heavy funder of Gavi, CEPI and many other vaccine projects, as supporting traditional patent rights for pharma companies."
1691,"“[Bill] Gates has staked out this outsized role in the vaccine world,” Love said."
1692,“He has an ideological belief that the intellectual property system is a wonderful mechanism that is necessary for innovation and prosperity.”
1693,"This is literally the 3rd paragraph:

&gt;Instead, they are coming to the conclusion that rather than making a long-promised exit, the virus will most likely become a manageable threat that will continue to circulate in the United States for years to come, still causing hospitalizations and deaths but in much smaller numbers."
1694,Does that sound like fear mongering?
1695,"If so, they're doing a really bad job at it."
1696,Must have been a logistical nightmare
1697,"Staggering to think that so many vaccinations have been given, but there are so many more that still need to be given"
1698,the limited data we have says you can get it again after being infected.
1699,The government has no part to play in the data gathering.
1700,You're giving people way too much credit.
1701,"There's a hell of a lot of people that still think Covid is a government conspiracy or ""just the flu""."
1702,"You might try to say that only includes a small minority of people, but I'd beg to differ... At my last job in Arkansas less than 10% of the 260 employees got vaccinated when eligible."
1703,"Moved to Illinois and while it's better here, still more than half the employees at my current job, refuse."
1704,I see it and hear it every day.
1705,"If they don't believe in covid in the first place or think it's no big deal, they sure as hell don't care about the risk they're putting on others."
1706,"I literally just tried again to schedule my second dose and Walgreens, CVS and Harris Teeter all had none available."
1707,So going back to the mass site Wednesday.
1708,"Not young, also in Virginia."
1709,Language used and some semantics about enforcing vaccination.
1710,"The Army and schools, for example, can't require the vaccine at the moment because it's only authorized for emergency use."
1711,That changes when it gets full FDA approval.
1712,"&gt;In reality, whether it is Gottlieb, Fauci, or now even Walensky, a big cohort of prominent voices is very encouraged that current vaccination levels should drive big drops in numbers this summer and make this deadly disease far more manageable."
1713,Huh?
1714,"That's *exactly* what the article says:

&gt;Instead, they are coming to the conclusion that rather than making a long-promised exit, the virus will most likely become a manageable threat that will continue to circulate in the United States for years to come, still causing hospitalizations and deaths but in much smaller numbers."
1715,That doesn't sound alarmist or pessimistic to me.
1716,And it's not like they buried that paragraph.
1717,It's the 3rd paragraph!
1718,"It sounds like an objective, rational prognosis for what's ahead considering we have so many in this country who refuse to be vaccinated."

1720,This whole pandemic has made me realize how much I was ignoring.
1721,"I'll throw some on if I'm touching a bunch of stuff, but I'm no where near as crazy with it like i was during the peak of the pandemic."
1722,Especially after they said there was a very small chance of it spreading by surface.
1723,Just why
1724,I wasn’t talking about the process of getting infected.
1725,I was talking about people not listening to health advice.
1726,Smokers are the best example of a large group of people who do something with no positive health consequences and lots of negative ones.
1727,We have lots of people in Tennessee who don’t listen to health messaging at all.
1728,"They don’t care about losing weight, stopping smoking or not taking fentanyl."

1788,They were asking on the pa for people to come to the pharmacy section.

1798,So you started attacking blanket statements using a blanket statement.
1799,The you started attacking incivility and your comment got removed for breaking civility rules!
1800,"Now it turns out that the blanket statement is the use of the term ""antivaxxer"" to describe people who are... anti vaccination, because we can't assume that everyone who is against vaccination is... against vaccination!?"
1801,I mean... really?
1802,That term isn't even pejorative - it's just descriptive.
1803,"So we end up with an even more blanket statement from you which is effectively: ""Everyone who uses the term antivaxxer is guilty of hatred and unfairness and prejudice...""  That's not in the least civil."
1804,You *are* making yourself superior to everyone and you *are* doing the very thing you attack others for.
1805,If your child has an adverse reaction to any medication (and any medication is capable of side effects) that's horrible and no-one should stop you telling your personal story and no-one should label you as an antivaxxer.
1806,"If you fall down a rabbit hole of misinformation and you start telling people not to vaccinate on the basis of something which is objectively false, then people do have a moral duty to counter the spreading of misinformation."
1807,There's nothing wrong with that.
1808,"And you are, in that case, part of the anti-vaccine movement, and it does not seem in the least unreasonable or even pejorative to call you an antivaxxer."
1809,I'm mean... that's just a word to describe something.

1816,Are you talking about the anti vax campaign against AZ?
1817,"Because what is probably really killing the AZ widespread, non-profit distribution is the Gates Foundation pushing Oxford to keep the patent exclusive, rather than release the information for anyone to produce, in order to make money."

Indian double-mutant COVID strain found in neighbouring Nepal as cases explode

Posted 8h ago
Three people in full PPE salute behind two stretchers carrying bodies wrapped in fabric."
1840,Nepal's health minister says infections have surged past the health system's capacity.
1841,"(
AP: Niranjan Shrestha
)
Coronavirus cases in Nepal have exploded as the virulent Indian strain of the virus crosses the two neighbouring countries' open border."
1842,"Key points:

Nepal reported a record 7,137 new COVID-19 cases on Sunday
Nearly 40 per cent of people tested returned a positive result
Nepal has an 1,800-kilometre open border with India
The seven-day average of new daily cases in Nepal rose to 4,544 on May 1 — up from just 136 at the start of April."
1843,"The surge in infections last week prompted the government to impose new lockdowns in major cities and towns, restricting the movement of people and vehicles and shuttering markets, offices and schools."
1844,Tens of thousands of people rushed out of Kathmandu to avoid the 15-day shutdown that began on Thursday.
1845,"""Infections have surged beyond the capacity of the health system,"" Nepal's health ministry said on Friday as it warned that hospital beds were running out amid a spike in infections."
1846,"On Sunday, the Himalayan nation recorded 7,137 new cases, a record high."
1847,"Nearly 40 per cent of people tested returned a positive result, data from the ministry showed."
1848,The government has enforced lockdowns or partial lockdowns in almost half of Nepal's 77 districts.
1849,A Nepalese health worker in protective gear drags oxygen cylinder inside a COVID-19 ward.
1850,Nepalese hospitals have been inundated with COVID-19 patients.
1851,"(
AP: Niranjan Shrestha
)
Hospital beds were already scarce and medical resources stretched as the country entered the new wave trying to recover from an economic hit from a nearly four-month lockdown last year."
1852,"India reported 3,689 COVID-19 deaths on Sunday — the highest single-day rise yet in the pandemic, to take the overall toll to more than 215,000."
1853,"Just under 400,000 infections were added, bringing the total number of cases past 19.5 million."
1854,The latest figures in India came as medical equipment — including oxygen-generation plants — was flown into the capital New Delhi from France and Germany as part of a huge international effort.
1855,"Nepal's latest concern has been the 1,800-kilometre open border the Himalayan nation shares with India."
1856,Tens of thousands of Nepalese migrant workers have been returning to Nepal across this border as India's health system breaks down.
1857,"The government has ordered tests and quarantines for those arriving, but in practice many people slip through undetected and travel to their villages."
1858,A man in a surgical mask and robes swings a smoking censer in front of a temple.
1859,Both the Indian double-mutant strain and the UK coronavirus variants have been found in Nepal.
1860,"(
AP: Niranjan Shrestha
)
""We have detected the UK variant and the double mutant variant detected in India,"" Krishna Prasad Paudel, the director of Nepal's Epidemiology and Disease Control Department Paudel told Reuters last week, adding that experts were checking for other variants too."
1861,"Nepal's former king, Gyanendra, and his wife, who tested positive for the virus after returning from India where they attended a religious festival, were undergoing treatment at a private facility in Kathmandu."
1862,"""The situation is really frightening,"" said Prakash Thapa, a doctor at Bheri hospital in Nepalgunj, a city in the south-west plains bordering India."
1863,He said the hospital was inundated with coronavirus patients requiring intensive care and ventilators.
1864,"""This time even children and young people are brought in critical condition and patients are even sleeping on the floor and corridors,"" he said."
1865,"Nepal's ruling Communist Party has been embroiled in a power struggle for months, and Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has been criticised for his response to the crisis."
1866,"Nepal began a vaccination campaign in January with 1 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine donated by India, but this was suspended because of India's refusal to allow exports as its domestic situation worsened."
1867,"Nepal has also paid for an additional 1 million doses from India, but has been waiting for the delivery since March."
1868,This shipment is needed for elderly people scheduled for a second dose in May.
1869,"The campaign was resumed with 800,000 vaccine doses donated by China, and now Nepal is negotiating with Russian authorities for supplies of Russian vaccines."

1910,I guess schools are now going to be biohazard breeding grounds.
1911,This is drastically different given we’re still talking a vaccine..
1912,I've done indoor dining four times since I got my second dose in mid-March.
1913,Two of them were on vacation so I pushed my limits and ate in a normal touristy restaurant.
1914,"But ever since I came home, it still just doesn't feel right eating inside when it's packed."
1915,I'm not willing to accept that without trying everything we possibly can to increase demand.
1916,"Just some ideas of things that federal, state, and local governments can do to increase demand:

1."
1917,"Start a nationwide advertising campaign targeting the demographics most likely to not be vaccinated and educating them on the benefits;
2."
1918,Offer perks to people who get the vaccine.
1919,"I'm thinking a $50 to $100 gift card to places like Target, Walmart, grocery stores, etc."
1920,"would get a lot of people on the fence vaccinated;
3."
1921,"Work with local religious and community leaders to encourage the people in their community to get the vaccine;
4."
1922,"Make it a requirement to be vaccinated to travel by airplane;
5."
1923,Not counting vaccinated people for capacity limits.
1924,There are a lot of things that can be done and should be done to get as many people vaccinated as possible.
1925,"""Almost always"" and ""The most serious"" don't mean never or none."
1926,Wasting time?
1927,"Pfizer/BioNTech is making almost 200M/month in EU alone, almost double of the US production."
1928,Getting Curevac in the mix has not taken any resource from any other producer.
1929,"Curevac is quite interesting, especially because it is supposed to be very easy to make and adapt, even more so than Pfizer and Moderna."
1930,That just sounds like agoraphobia/generalized anxiety disorder.
1931,I got like that *way* before COVID.
1932,Maybe in time for band camp!!
1933,!
1934,Likely both.
1935,"Higher severity could be caused by seasonality toward the end of winter (in places where it still is wintery, like Oregon, Colorado, Michigan), or by more severe strains."
1936,Both are unproven though.
1937,"Meanwhile hospital outcomes have improved really dramatically, so it's likely that we are hospitalizing more people and decreasing out-of-hospital bad outcomes."
1938,"Deaths/hospitalizations in Colorado have dropped by a factor of 4-6, while hospitalizations/cases have remained constant."
1939,"We know that older people are exponentially more likely to require hospitalization, so something is going on beyond the simplest dynamics."
1940,the fact that this sub doesnt auto ban posters from the anti vax subs is boolshit.
1941,My kindergartener just went back 2 days a week last month and it’s going better than I expected.

1947,"This, of course, does not mean restrictions should not be repealed on their behalf"
1948,[removed]
1949,Local mandates are one of the few things keeping the numbers down in Florida.
1950,This dude is nuts.
1951,Irresponsible to allow non-vaccinated people on planes and trains.

1953,It's no more dangerous than driving your car.
1954,"100%, I could care less about wearing a mask and most people are more then happy to do so, as long as they can do everything else they used to do"
1955,Either pay them to get the shot or open things up so they can get sick quicker and we can be done with this nightmare sooner.
1956,Just hoping they change their minds is not working and just prolonging things.
1957,I've got all of my hopes for a July UK reopening for US citizens without quarantine.

1959,[deleted]
1960,same!
1961,"I thought I would feel some relief being vaccinated myself, but realized I will not be able to until my children are protected too!"
1962,Vaccines don’t have side effects that show up more than a few months after the shot.
1963,They do their thing and then they dissolve quickly.
1964,"&gt;Any adverse side effects from vaccines almost always “show up within the first two weeks, and certainly by the first two months,” said Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health."
1965,"&gt;The most serious vaccine side effects in history have all been caught within six weeks, said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital in Philadelphia and a member of the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee."
1966,"&gt;“I would say, please tell me what vaccine has ever been shown to cause a long-term side effect that was not picked up in the first two months,” said Offit, a co-creator of the rotavirus vaccine who has studied vaccinology for more than four decades."

1968,"Originally it was one of the days the banks designated as their holidays, and because no money could change hands when the banks were closed everyone else had to take those days off too."
1969,"They usually coincide with religious holidays, but some are fairly random."
1970,You are counting it inside this week then?
1971,In that case I can see where the 1M+ comes from
1972,Yay!!!
1973,So happy for you!!
1974,Then there’s IL who is still stuck at 50 indoor and 100 outdoor.
1975,&gt;	Yes.
1976,Source?
1977,I thought it was still uncertain.
1978,"Once supply is available for everyone and it's fully FDA approved, government should set a date that the vaccine stops being free."
1979,That might get more to get it sooner than later.
1980,"We will still have to deal with 6ft apart at tables and bar seating, so the 100% is disingenuous."
1981,some small restaurants can fit a lot of people inside them.
1982,But not with 6ft between each table.
1983,Most bars aren't huge enough to fit a lot of people that far apart.
1984,"A lot would be limited to 2 or 3 patrons at the bar itself if 6ft of distance is needed between them, bars in nyc don't really have bars longer then 24ft."
1985,"Regardless of 100% capacity it would still not really be back to normal, unless places just disregard the rules."
1986,Freeeeeedooooommmmm!
1987,"Never underestimate the importance of **quantitative** data -- actual numbers instead of a ""feeling"" or ""opinion"""
1988,Yep.
1989,The vaccines in Florida have been and already are freely available for a few weeks.
1990,"The governor here said by July 1st all rules are off, and quite frankly he's right."
1991,It's not up to the government or Applebees at a certain point to make sure someone's unvaccinated dumb ass doesn't come into their establishment and get Covid.
1992,"That's on them, and if they didn't want to get covid."
1993,"Restaurants don't need to advertise they are covid free environment, it's just an environment and if you don't like the fact that you might get covid, you've had ample time to get the vaccine for yourself."
1994,[removed]
1995,"
&gt;It's true that the Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines have emergency use authorization from the FDA and not full approval yet."
1996,"But that's **only because not enough time has passed to show how long the vaccines stay effective**, Offit said."
1997,"&gt;""Frankly, the only real difference was in length of follow-up,"" he said."
1998,"""Typically, you like to see efficacy for a year or two years."""
1999,&gt;**He stressed that the vaccines' EUA status doesn't mean they're less safe**.
2000,"As a member of the FDA vaccine advisory committee, Offit said the vaccines are reviewed with the **same level of scrutiny as they would to get full approval**."

2002,https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/28/health/covid-vaccine-myths-debunked/index.html
2003,US is no where near 100% vaccinations yet.
2004,"But yes, they are shipping the AZ supplies out of country."
2005,Nice
2006,"Reddit user ""Trumpotus"" says ""I estimated""

Whelp, that one speaks for itself folks."
2007,[removed]
2008,Olympics should be moved to the US where everyone could easily be vaccinated and where they could jury rig stadiums to do this.
2009,Then all of this goes away.
2010,What a national embarrassment for Japan!
2011,Its actually completely proper to point out that a group of people that some thought (stupidly) were nearly-immune from the worst effects are becoming more of a problem in raw case count.
2012,"We have, or did have, a problem that needs to be targeted and resolved."
2013,"&gt;	God I hate the media through all of this they are doing no one favors

Have they ever?"
2014,"IF that was the case, but that is not the consequence of the Danish decision."
2015,The elderly and risk groups are not affected at all.
2016,The 25-39 year olds are postponed 4 weeks.
2017,Everybody else 1-2 weeks.
2018,Number of new cases has been stable for three months.
2019,Number of hospitalised has been low and stable and there’s 2 deaths per day on average.
2020,Every day 5-10% of the population take a free test.
2021,Reopening is currently going faster than planned.
2022,"Hm, maybe the data from ourworldindata isn't updated"
2023,Ah good.
2024,Very british.
2025,I love it.
2026,"On the vial to the rabies vaccine they gave my cats it said for cats, dogs, and horses only."
2027,Shame on Canada
2028,"&gt;That includes 3,748 people who tested positive the day they returned despite having to show a negative COVID-19 test taken no more than three days before they boarded their plane."
2029,And that's why covid's relatively long incubation period is so treacherous...
2030,The cynic in me also wonders how many of those negative pre-flight tests were fakes.
2031,There are plenty of anecdotes about people in other countries selling fake test results for just a few bucks.
2032,[removed]
2033,By this data we're losing about 1pp of growth per week among the 18-49 age ranges.
2034,"*If* that keeps up we'll effectively stall out in about 3 weeks at about 55% of 40-49 with one dose, 49% of 30-39 and 39% of 20-29."
2035,We might add a percent per month from then on but nothing significant.
2036,"If we stall out at those numbers, we'll probably be right about at 60% of the adult population with a shot, but hard to see how we make it much beyond that."
2037,"Anyone in the 20-29 age range, does that seem right?"
2038,Will we get less than 40% of the younger population with a shot?
2039,agree 100%
2040,The extra AZ last week is delivered to doctors this week (today I think).
2041,"So yes, taken into account."
2042,:)
2043,I guess that's where I disagree.
2044,Being fully vaccinated means I have lowered the risk a substantial amount.
2045,That's not debatable.
2046,If we are trying to get the risk to 0% that's not gonna happen.
2047,I won't blame people for staying home but I also hope I wouldn't get judged for going to restaurant after the 2nd shot.
2048,It's called Pfizer
2049,I brought someone with me and that helped a lot!

2062,1.
2063,"The vaccine induced immunity will not last forever, and it is unlikely that we will get the same percentage of people to revaccinate as the years go by."
2064,"The more community spread there is over a period of years, the greater the likelihood of another pandemic as people who didn’t keep up on their vaccines become exposed again."
2065,2.
2066,Children still cannot be vaccinated and there is a portion of the population for whom the vaccines are not effective.
2067,Herd immunity is necessary to protect the most vulnerable among us and enabling unmitigated spread among the unvaccinated robs the vulnerable of the ability to safely exist in the world.
2068,3.
2069,We don’t really know what the breakthrough rate is because of low levels of testing among the vaccinated.
2070,If it turns out that breakthrough is more common and that asymptomatic breakthrough cases can result in long Covid (we know initially asymptomatic cases can result in long Covid in the unvaccinated population) then community spread could pose a non-negligible risk to the vaccinated.

2083,"Well, it’s not that they don’t protect 5% of people."

2107,How is that related to vaccine production?
2108,"&gt;""I thought I taught you a lesson the first time, I guess I need to amp it up a bit""."
2109,Great way to explain the reasoning behind the second shot!
2110,"And yet despite all this, we still have people claiming that the vaccines don’t stop you from getting it."
2111,This pandemic made for some really horrific data... And all that data points in the same direction: for-profit long-term-care homes are pretty awful.
2112,Some of the reports from Quebec and Ontario homes were downright nightmarish.
2113,"I hope things will permanently change in the very near future, but those for-profit homes have a lot of lobbyists... &lt;\_&lt;"
2114,"""In this episode, Dr. Josh Sharfstein talks with Hopkins researchers who break down three papers looking at reinfection."

2116,"Henri Garrison-Desany, a doctoral student in epidemiology, talks about two papers: a Lancet paper from Denmark and one in the Journal of Infection from Brazil."
2117,"These researchers are part of the Hopkins novel coronavirus research consortium, with many summaries of new studies available at http://ncrc.jhsph.edu."""

2119,Deportation in general is interesting.
2120,"Sounds like Australia is not allowing planes originating from India to land, I doubt India is going to insist on anything but that traveler pay for their own accommodations."
2121,"Do citizens have an absolute right to entry, sort of if you look at the UN stuff on stateless people but not really."
2122,Definitely not immediate reentry and especially not after having been warned and while posing a clear hazard.
2123,"Also as a data point, some “kid versions” of medications have more of the active ingredient than an adult version because they have a higher metabolism and such."
2124,"Also the vaccines are pulled out of multi does vials with syringes, so if it was deemed to need less, the nurse administering the shot would just pull less into the syringe."
2125,read this earlier today on either svt or dn so no clue why you’d get downvoted for that
2126,"Yeah there are definitely people with a ptsd type thing from this, I hate this phrase but it has truly been an “unprecedented year” so it makes sense."
2127,It’ll take some people longer to adjust
2128,"If it helps at all, the needle they use (at least for Pfizer, not sure about the others) is really, really tiny."
2129,I literally didn't even feel either of my injections.
2130,[removed]
2131,Not long ago people thought it would be impossible for Germany to vaccinate as fast as the US.
2132,"It’s now proven that Germany can, and only disappointing deliveries can stop them now."
2133,Personally I think the chance that BioNTech will deliver even more than they already promised is pretty high.
2134,&gt;No one was doing this process at scale 6 months ago.
2135,"I mean, yes the mRNA vaccines were being manufactured 6 months ago."
2136,But not long before that.
2137,"The point is, however, you’re able to see this, but not able to see that other places which aren’t manufacturing it currently, could also be manufacturing it in the future."
2138,Manufacturers were asking in the fall to begin the process of setting up the facilities.
2139,Pfizer and moderna both rejected outright.
2140,"So those places could’ve been manufacturing vaccines now, and aiding in the push to get poorer countries vaccinated before 2024."
2141,That didn’t happen obviously.
2142,"Now, they could start this process now, because again we’re talking about 2024 before some countries are vaccinated, and actually have vaccines being produced in the coming months.....

Why do you, random reddexoert,  insist that the vaccines could only be manufactured where they are currently, when numerous experts are exclaiming they could now be manufacturing vaccines had the assistance program been utilized in the fall?"

2144,Brexit has literally saved 1000s of British lives!
2145,Thanks!
2146,"The article describes how I feel right now, down to the questions about how busy somewhere is."
2147,[removed]
2148,Yet the vaccination dates here are pushed back to September.
2149,Yep.
2150,"Come on, there's no need to be this dramatic."
2151,"It's a very temporary solution, it's not like boomers will be partying in clubs while everyone else will be cooped up at home until 2025."
2152,By July pretty much everyone who wants a vaccine will have had one.
2153,"In the meantime, it sounds unfair but what's the alternative?"
2154,Keeping boomers at home as well?

2156,Pretty sure it's a two-fer....
2157,"I know it's a Monday, but no Monty Python banter?"

2159,"We could be done by the 4th of July if we pick it back up to last month’s levels, which I’m arguing is only possible with incentives"
2160,"Yeah but this timeline is according to the people who gave us the classic ""It's just two weeks to save Christmas"" and, their latest hit, ""We won't give special rights back to people who are vaccinated until everyone has had the chance."""
2161,"For all we know, someone could have a blood clot from Biontech tomorrow."
2162,I'll believe I'm getting vaccinated when they're disinfecting my arm and not a second before.

2178,You might not want a vaccine passport but that doesn’t mean that other countries are going to let you visit if you are not vaccinated.
2179,You aren’t the king of the universe and no one considers Texas a model for responding to COVID.
2180,Texas has an incredibly high rate of deaths and low rate of vaccination.
2181,Japan is in a rough spot.
2182,They can't afford to not have the games but they are also not looking good in terms of vaccinations.
2183,"They can't afford to not sell every single seat and have stadiums and hotels packed full of tourists, but that just seems like a really bad situation to have happen"
2184,I thought India was the biggest vaccine manufacturer in the world?

2194,I came here hoping for some confirmation that they are meeting this week because the article seems speculative.
2195,I would think they'd give more than 4 business days notice of the meeting if it is going to happen this week but maybe since it's just extending the age range it's less of a concern.
2196,Didn't they put the meeting on the schedule very shortly after the EUA application for J&amp;J/Moderna/Pfizer's adult EUA application?
2197,I moved my now 12 year old to our current district almost three years ago.

 Vaccinated but won't go out?"
2201,"The rise of Covid anxiety syndrome  
 [*By*Rosa Silverman](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/rosa-silverman/) 3 May 2021 • 6:00am   
 

Renee Watson, a healthy 43-year-old, has received both her coronavirus jabs already."
2202,"Meanwhile, the UK Covid infection rate has dwindled and the size of our vaccinated population has swelled."
2203,"Lockdown is easing, pavement cafes and beer gardens are teeming, and life is inching back to something more like normality."
2204,"But not so much for Watson, nor those like her who may be suffering – to a greater or lesser degree – from what has been termed [Covid anxiety syndrome](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/forgotten-make-small-talk-suffering-re-entry-anxiety/)."
2205,"Watson, an entrepreneur who was once “quite a risk-taker” feels far happier playing it safe now."
2206,"“I thought I’d spring back and return to being keen to go to restaurants and shopping,” says the mother-of-two from Oxfordshire."
2207,“But I’ve really not wanted to at all.
2208,I’m still ordering everything online.
2209,"It’s not like me, it’s strange: I’m normally a sociable person and like going to festivals but it feels like too much risk at the moment.”

Watson’s response to the easing of lockdown is not all that uncommon, say psychologists."
2210,"It is not yet known how many people will be affected by residual Covid anxiety after vaccination, but it’s feared a significant minority will struggle to readjust, especially as increased unlocking allows for large groups and big, crowded events to take place again."
2211,"While many of us are enjoying the chance to socialise and travel normally, some are clinging fearfully to the safety behaviours enforced upon us during the pandemic."
2212,What was once a rational response to danger has become a “maladaptive” response as the danger recedes.
2213,"It was Marcantonio Spada, professor of addictive behaviours and mental health at London South Bank University, and Ana Nikčević, a psychology professor at Kingston University, who identified and named the phenomenon of Covid-19 anxiety syndrome."
2214,"Early in the pandemic, they hypothesised there would be a number of coping behaviours people would adopt in relation to the perceived threat of Covid, which, while initially helpful, may over time become problematic, especially during the process of reintegration."
2215,"These behaviours – which may include not touching things, avoiding using public transport, worrying, and monitoring our environment and other people for the presence of the virus – could potentially keep us “stuck”, they suggested."
2216,"“In people who use these coping strategies consistently, excessively, daily, with the view they will keep them safe, \[it\] may inadvertently ‘lock’ them into Covid-19-related [fear and distress and hinder their reintegration](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/overcome-fear-going-little-help-germany/) and return to normal,” say the researchers."
2217,Data they have collected in both the US and UK bears out their theory.
2218,Their findings suggest that those at a greater risk from the virus are more prone to Covid anxiety syndrome.
2219,"But Spada believes as many as one in five people could struggle with the return to normality, and that women under 40 may be particularly affected, since other research has shown this demographic to be worst hit by the pandemic psychologically."
2220,"For Watson, who studied immunology, it’s the uncertainty surrounding the virus that troubles her."
2221,"“I’m a massive advocate of vaccines, but Covid has been so unpredictable, it hasn’t behaved like we’d expect a virus of this kind,” she says."
2222,"“So although I think vaccination will definitely give me a level of protection, I don’t think we yet know fully what that protection will look like, and with the emergence of lots of variants we don’t know how well the current vaccine will protect us against emerging strains."
2223,So I don’t necessarily want to put myself at risk.
2224,"The children going back to school feels like enough of a risk.”

Thoughts like these are echoed in online messaging forums."
2225,"“The virus hasn’t gone away,” wrote one Gransnet user last month."
2226,"“Even if like me you have had both vaccinations, there is no guarantee a variant won’t turn up and require more and different vaccines."
2227,"I don’t intend to go daft now, just because someone says we can.” Another replied: “I’ve got used to living the way I do now and will find it difficult to live normally again.”

Richard, a 53-year-old from north London who works in property, says his worries centre around the failure of others to stick to the rules - and the fact the vaccine does not guarantee 100 per cent protection."
2228,"“I had my vaccination 12 days ago, but I could still get Covid,” he says."
2229,“Even if I wasn’t \[severely\] ill I could still have side effects or long Covid.
2230,I do feel nervous.
2231,"You feel a bit ‘bah humbug’ if you [ask your friends how many people are going to be there](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/family/life/art-declining-invitations/) when you visit, but I want to put myself at minimal risk.”

Experts say cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) can be helpful to “actively break those negative cycles of thought and action,” as Dr Victoria Salem, an endocrinologist and researcher at Imperial College London, puts it."
2232,"Salem, who has been working on a study of the syndrome with Spada, has seen evidence of it in her own practice among patients of various ages."
2233,"“We are seeing it even in people who have been fully vaccinated and that’s worrying because pretty soon we’ll be expecting people to go back to much more normal routines,” she says."
2234,"Owen O’Kane, a former NHS clinical lead for mental health and author of *Ten Times Happier*, predicts an increase in anxiety disorders as we emerge from lockdown, not only centering around the fear of Covid itself but also broader worries about reintegration."
2235,“I’m seeing people who weren’t socially anxious now struggling with lockdowns easing and having to socially interact.
2236,"Also an increase in people finding public spaces claustrophobic or too busy.”

Fear of missing out has, for some, become [fear of going out](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/mind/help-friend-afraid-go/)."
2237,"O’Kane, a psychotherapist, suggests a proportion of the population will suffer from what he calls “post-pandemic stress disorder” and says: “We’re not going to see the true impact until the pandemic is completely over.”

Indeed, the true scale of the problem is likely to be larger than what is evident now."
2238,"“The trauma aspect of this has been understated,” he says."
2239,"“Many people, to a degree, have experienced some trauma."
2240,"We’ve been locked away for a year by and large, all our routines have changed, we’ve been watching horrific headlines every day and are constantly engulfed in a culture of fear."
2241,"Unquestionably that’s going to traumatise people.”

Clinicians can help by encouraging people to “step out of fear mode” and start making some gradual behavioural changes, he says."
2242,"“You’d encourage people to drop the safety behaviours and say ‘this is keeping you more anxious.’”

Prof Nikčević is broadly optimistic."
2243,"“We believe the majority of people will be able to release these coping strategies \[eventually\],” she says."
2244,"“We need to gradually encourage \[them\]...so people can, over time, release these mental controls.”

For Watson, it will be a matter of watching how things play out."
2245,"“I don’t think rushing to get back to being in densely populated areas at the moment is going to do any of us any favours,” she says."
2246,“I’m just going to take it easy and see what happens.”
2247,[removed]
2248,Paywall.
2249,"I know many won't like to hear this and just say to get over it, but if I'm honest the biggest deterrent for me going out to places now that I'm vaccinated is the continued mask requirement at these places."
2250,"I'll wear one at the store because I have to, but for more recreational things I'm choosing to pass until a mask isn't required."
2251,Germany is expecting 192K doses today or tomorrow.
2252,Welcome to modern journalism lol
2253,We're waiting on both safety and efficacy data.
2254,"""The approval status of the Pfizer‑BioNTech COVID‑19 Vaccine varies worldwide."
2255,"In countries where the vaccine has not been approved by the relevant regulatory authority, it is an investigational drug, and its **safety and efficacy have not been established**. """
2256,[Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine | cvdvaccine.com](https://www.cvdvaccine.com/)
2257,Nice picture chosen for this article.
2258,They're giving 0.5% what's needed this year.
2259,And then giving 4.5% a year too late.
2260,And then blocking the world from making the rest.
2261,Thank you!
2262,It’s not just about them.
2263,We need to immunize the herd in order to achieve herd immunity.
2264,"as long as it means we won’t have to go through with any more restrictions again, im completely fine with the 5 week gap between loosening them"
2265,Same here in my approach.
2266,"I cant see them not wanting vaccination to happen - but I can see them wanting to run out the clock so that the Administration has enough time as to *seem* like they did all kinds of things, including the very cautious messaging you refer to, to cause cases, hospitalizations, and deaths to free fall (cases and hospitalizations are already starting to and deaths will be very soon)."
2267,Don’t forget the COVID side effect deaths.
2268,"The people who didn’t go to the doctor because of COVID concerns and restrictions, and the resulting delayed treatment for heart issues, or cancers."
2269,"I believe that these May account for the difference between COVID reported, and excess deaths!"
2270,Nope.
2271,Read the lead article in the New York Times this morning.
2272,It’s not going to happen through natural infection because of variants.
2273,90% vaccination is the only way to actual herd immunity with a disease this infectious.
2274,Not true.
2275,Safety hasn't been established according to Pfizer.
2276,"""The approval status of the Pfizer‑BioNTech COVID‑19 Vaccine varies worldwide."
2277,"In countries where the vaccine has not been approved by the relevant regulatory authority, it is an investigational drug, and its **safety and efficacy have not been established**. """
2278,[Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine | cvdvaccine.com](https://www.cvdvaccine.com/)
2279,I'm okay with this decision.
2280,"I understand the risks, but I am of the opinion that this is the better move."
2281,"Yes...AND we looked at Italy in horror last year, shortly before we lived that horror."
2282,The variant decimating India is already in the US.
2283,We may see another wave-likely 9f ppl not vaccinated.
2284,bu-but the stonks...
2285,What an idiot.
2286,Good move imo.
2287,I think they more meant like they can’t find anywhere they are able to do it
2288,I wish I took a picture of the sidewalk when I was running errands yesterday.
2289,Then you'd understand why most people in my neighborhood are still wearing masks.
2290,"Some parts of the city aren't crowded, but my neighborhood is right near Central Park and a popular shopping area and it's packed."
2291,"My father-in-law, who believes COVID is a hoax and Donald Trump won the 2020 election, got vaccinated."
2292,He would never admit it publicly but he told my wife.
2293,Haven’t they though
2294,I haven't seen anything that says kids that young are going to be eligible by this fall.
2295,Where are you seeing that?
2296,"I feel you're playing a bit of a semantical game here, because the clear meaning behind my comment was ""you are able to get vaccinated"", as he seemed to think he was not able to."
2297,"Plus approval vs authorization is primarily, as others have pointed out, a bureaucratic step, and one certain to pass within the next couple months."
2298,I think the problem is the other half of his friends.
2299,The ones who didn’t have protective parents?
2300,The ones running unknown risks with a novel disease?
2301,Kids can recover from a lack of socialization.
2302,Send them to Poland!
2303,We'll take it.
2304,I had mine yesterday.
2305,[removed]
2306,That's a horrible thing to say about CF!
2307,It’s not straight forward.
2308,These things go through an ANDA or biologics equivalent which needs to prove bioequivalence.
2309,That may be any number of things differing for  each treatment.
2310,Why you think the vaccines which got EUA wouldn’t also have to have some process before lots are released after production is a bit of a mystery.
2311,WHAT ?!
2312,AGAIN ?!
2313,Why?
2314,That’s not how manufacturers vaccines work.
2315,The process used for other vaccines is not used for the mRNA or virus vector covid vaccines.
2316,It’s not a matter of new equipment.
2317,It’s like the difference between manufacturing  a microwave vs. a microchip fab.
2318,No one was doing this process at scale 6 months ago.
2319,And they don’t just want the patents.
2320,They want expertise and assistance in setting up this new process.
2321,This requires a lot of resources from the companies (that they are using to bring up other sites right now!)
2322,J&amp;J just had a scrap millions of doses at an approved lab because of quality control issues.
2323,This requires ongoing work to keep consistent.
2324,You can’t just publish the ‘blueprints’ and let everyone do whatever.
2325,I'm trying to figure out any way that this makes sense except that Murphy is up for re-election this year and he is trying to make nice with the restaurant lobby.
2326,"not to downplay the turnaround, but that's kind of like going from a D to a B in class."
2327,I want to see sports and concerts back because the positivity rate is so low.
2328,The 7-day-average is currently 15.
2329,My neighborhood in Brooklyn apparently hasn't gotten the memo that you don't need to wear masks outdoors anymore.
2330,"I mean, they can do whatever they want, but I stopped wearing it since the CDC announced it and now I feel some sort of weird shame for not wearing it."
2331,&gt; Didn't they say that you will need booster shots?
2332,It's always possible a booster shot will be needed.
2333,"At this point we don't know yet, though so far the vaccines seem very promising and effective against the variants, and immunity seems to be sticking, so we'll definitely have to see."
2334,"&gt; Pfizer and Moderna said that the vaccines are effective for 6 months after two shots, maybe longer

Probably longer."
2335,"You have to understand, **every** guidance in things like this is necessarily going to be conservative."
2336,"They can't say, ""we think it'll work for 5+ years"" when they have literally no data to suggest that."
2337,"&gt; If we end up needing this every year, then yes, we need to think about long term effects

No, again, almost certainly not."
2338,"Even a dose every year or six months is not going to be at a high enough rate that it causes some long term effect - again, how would that even work?"
2339,"But at this point, we may need **a** booster shot, but based on how effective the vaccines are against variants, I doubt we'll need more than 2-3 boosters at most over our lifetimes, as long as some sort of fastly evolving strain comes about, or one that is very difficult to create a vaccine for."
2340,"&gt; The difference is that the tech behind this vaccine is very new

It's not really."
2341,"It's been discussed since the 80s and active work has been done on it for over 10+ years, since the original SARS."
2342,"It's the first commercial use, but it's a pretty explored technology."
2343,"&gt; It's done with gene editing

No, it isn't."
2344,It's done with mRNA.
2345,"mRNA does not, and **cannot** edit genes."
2346,"You would need some sort of DNA polymerase or some other molecule that can cut DNA, add a relevant sequence and stitch it back together."
2347,"The vaccine has none of that, and it can't magically appear out of thin air."
2348,"These are all highly specific types of molecules, and they don't just arise out of nothing."
2349,"Trust me, if we could easily do somatic gene therapy, a **LOT** of diseases we currently have would disappear overnight."
2350,This is not at all how an mRNA vaccine works.
2351,Should definitely be voluntary.
2352,Allow people to sign a waiver and give them a list of side effect symptoms to watch out for.
2353,And yet it's still 2 weeks before I can legally go inside my mum's house.
2354,The relaxing of these restrictions has been absurdly slow.
2355,This is incorrect.
2356,There is no FDA approved vaccine.

2371,I’m as global minded as most others but I’m tired of seeing these takes for the nations who developed and paid for vaccines are bad for giving it to their populations first.

2379,&gt;	The research and production themselves are much more globally coordinated efforts than people believe on this thread.
2380,"But yes, a country’s involvement in R&amp;D can be one factor among a large group of variables in determining supply."
2381,"To be clear, we’re talking about the funding, not really the research and production itself."
2382,"Either way, I don’t think either is global in the sense that you’re talking about."
2383,"Almost all of the major production steps are being done in the US and Europe, as was most of the research."
2384,"The funding also came primarily from those areas, which is why they have received most of the doses."
2385,I don’t know how equitable it really is for the countries who put in most of the money and effort to develop and produce the vaccines to get a disproportionately small number of the doses.
2386,"&gt;	Also, it’s in the self-interest of high-income countries to ensure this equitable distribution to tackle this pandemic in a globally coordinated manner; those mutant strains in India, South Africa, Latin America can just as easily spread in wreak havoc in high-income countries."
2387,"It’s in their self interest to donate excess doses, sure."
2388,I don’t think it’s in their interest to donate doses that they themselves would use.
2389,"If a country has a choice between vaccination 50% of their own population or 1% of the entire world’s population, the former would definitely prevent their current deaths from covid, while the latter would only marginally reduce the potential of a new strain developing in a different country."

2393,"No vaccine is 100% safe, but they do offer some protection even against mutations that escape vaccine antibodies."

The Covax scheme had been expected to distribute at least 100 million doses worldwide by the end of March, but only 38 million jabs have been delivered so far."
2396,"Look into the details, this study is particularly low because they only look at 14 to 20 days after vaccination."
2397,Other studies have shown the effect still gets better after that.
2398,"And as said, it's lower for just documented cases, compared to more serious cases."
2399,So it varies what you look at (and when).
2400,I think it’s because vaccines aren’t dependent on body mass like medications are.
2401,A vaccine just needs to trigger your immune response but medications are absorbed by your tissues.
2402,"The more mass you have, the more tissue you have."
2403,Your immune system isn’t so dependent on mass.
2404,You're 5 weeks behind the US.
2405,"Everyone started at the same time, but the EU didn't blockade exports."
2406,"Germany in particular followed through on their ""vaccine equality"" statements, even though it put them behind by...well again just 5 weeks."

2418,Since the mRNA vaccines don't work like traditional vaccines do with weakened or dead forms of the virus ...
2419,I'd imagine it's probably safe if not safer than the traditional types to give the same vaccine dosage to kids.

2569,"Patients With Long Covid Face Lingering Worrisome Health Risks, Study Finds

Patients who were not sick enough to be hospitalized still had a significantly greater risk of dying within six months than people who were not infected."
2570,"The health effects of Covid-19 not only can stretch for months but appear to increase the risk of death and chronic medical conditions, even in people who were never sick enough to be hospitalized, a large new study finds."
2571,"In the study, published Thursday in the journal Nature, researchers looked at medical records of more than 73,000 people across the United States whose coronavirus infections did not require hospitalization."
2572,"Between one and six months after becoming infected, those patients had a significantly greater risk of death — 60 percent higher — than people who had not been infected with the virus."
2573,"The research, based on records of patients in the Department of Veterans Affairs health system, also found that nonhospitalized Covid survivors had a 20 percent greater chance of needing outpatient medical care over those six months than people who had not contracted the coronavirus."
2574,"The Covid survivors experienced a vast array of long-term medical problems that they had never had before — not just lung issues from the respiratory effects of the virus, but symptoms that could affect virtually any organ system or part of the body, from neurological to cardiovascular to gastrointestinal."
2575,"They were also at greater risk of mental health problems, including anxiety and sleep disorders."
2576,"“We found it all,” said an author of the study, Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly, chief of the research and development service at the VA St. Louis Health Care System."
2577,"“What was shocking about this when you put it all together was like ‘Oh my God,’ you see the scale,” he added."
2578,"“It’s still jarring, honestly.”

What’s more, some of the patients’ post-Covid medical issues — like diabetes, kidney disease and some heart problems — could become chronic conditions that would require treatment for the rest of their lives."
2579,"“People have continued respiratory disease, continued headache, this, that and the next thing,” said Dr. Laurie Jacobs, chairwoman of internal medicine at Hackensack University Medical Center, who was not involved in the study."
2580,“It’s not gone away.
2581,"And we don’t yet understand the underlying cause, and it’s become chronic in some cases, disabling in other cases."
2582,"In some areas, people have gotten better, but it’s very variable.”

The study is believed to be the largest yet to evaluate such a comprehensive array of health conditions."
2583,"The non-hospitalized Covid survivors in the study tested positive for the virus from March 1, 2020, through November."
2584,"Most of the nearly 32 million people who have contracted the coronavirus in the United States have not needed hospitalization, so in some ways the study may be applicable to a wide swath of the population."
2585,"But the Veterans Health System patients in the study may not be representative in other ways, including that 88 percent of them were male and their median age was 61."
2586,"Nearly 25 percent were Black, 70 percent were white and nearly 5 percent were other races."
2587,Researchers compared their risk of death and other characteristics with data from nearly 5 million patients in the Veterans system who did not have Covid-19 and were not hospitalized during that time.
2588,"That group had a median age of 67, was 90 percent male and had a somewhat larger proportion of white patients and a somewhat smaller proportion of Black patients."
2589,Dr. Jacobs said her clinic was seeing the wide range of symptoms in the study.
2590,But she said the risk of death among the study’s patients was considerably higher than she would have expected.
2591,"“I was really shocked by the number,” she said."
2592,"Between one and six months after experiencing a relatively mild or moderate infection, 1,672 of the 73,345 patients — about 2.3 percent — died, the study reported."
2593,It did not indicate what caused the deaths or anything specific about those patients’ conditions.
2594,"The researchers also could not say if people had underlying health conditions and whether their new symptoms were direct effects of their coronavirus infection, corollary effects of medications they were taking to treat some of the symptoms, stress from other pandemic-related problems or other influences."
2595,Experts said the study’s findings reflect a cascade of issues driven not just by the virus itself but by the medical system’s struggle to grapple with Covid-19 and its long-term effects.
2596,"“We have hundreds of thousands of people with an unrecognized syndrome and we are trying to learn about the immune response and how the virus changes that response and how the immune response can include all the organ systems in the body,” said Dr. Eleftherios Mylonakis, chief of infectious diseases at Brown University’s Warren Alpert Medical School and Lifespan hospitals, who was not involved in the study."
2597,"“The health system is not made to deal with something like this.”

In many cases, Dr. Mylonakis said, people experiencing new symptoms who were never acutely sick from the viral infection enter a confusing and balkanized medical world, where they seek help from primary care doctors and then are referred to various specialists who each try to figure out how to treat conditions that fall under their particular area of expertise."
2598,That helps explain why the study found that the Covid survivors had about one-and-a-half times more outpatient visits a month than patients in the general V.A.
2599,population.
2600,"“We’re dealing with silos,” Dr. Mylonakis said."
2601,"“Every time that we have a transfer, something is lost."
2602,"The patient loses and that may make their other long Covid symptoms worse.”

For example, “if I’m an endocrinologist, I’m going to look at the blood sugar, I’m not going to look at the 14 other systems,” he said."
2603,"“But the problem with the blood sugar may be because this person has such weakness and fogginess that they cannot go to the supermarket and get healthy foods, so they’re going to order pizza.”

Dr. Mylonakis said the unified nature of the Veterans system may actually make it better at coordinating care and sharing patient information among specialists, so for patients outside that system, the frustration and confusion may add considerable stress that aggravates their symptoms."
2604,"Still, the complexity of long-term Covid is abundantly evident within the Veterans system too."
2605,"“I have patients that get out of bed for 10 minutes to prepare a salad and they can’t eat it because they’re totally exhausted, so tired by the time they put a small salad together,” said Dr. Al-Aly."
2606,"The research showed that Covid survivors were also more likely to be taking a spectrum of medications for their newly emerged health problems, including opioids, which Dr. Al-Aly said was concerning because it might portend another wave of opioid addiction problems in the future."
2607,"Dr. Al-Aly and his co-authors Yan Xie and Benjamin Bowe, both at Washington University in St. Louis, also analyzed records of 13,654 patients who had been hospitalized for their initial coronavirus infection."
2608,"Unsurprisingly, they found that the sickest patients — those who needed intensive care — were at the greatest risk of long-term complications, followed by those who were hospitalized in regular wards, followed by patients who were never hospitalized."
2609,"Nonetheless, virtually every category of symptom — from chest pain to shortness of breath to diabetes to muscle weakness — were experienced by at least some of the people who were never hospitalized."
2610,"“I would interpret this as saying ‘It’s everywhere,’” Dr. Al-Aly said."
2611,“Even if you just stayed at home and then quote-unquote recovered in three or four days.
2612,And that’s very important because that segment really is the lion’s share of Covid patients.
2613,"Most people, when they get Covid, they don’t get hospitalized.”

For people who were hospitalized, their experiences involved significantly greater risk of long-term health complications than people hospitalized for seasonal flu, the study found."
2614,"They were more likely to develop or have persistent symptoms in a wide array of categories beyond the respiratory manifestations of Covid: neurological, cognitive, psychological, cardiovascular, metabolic gastrointestinal, anemia and blood clotting problems as well as fatigue and malaise."
2615,"Dr. Mylonakis and other experts noted that the understanding of the virus and the status of medical treatment are evolving quickly, and this progress is already translating into improvement for some patients."
2616,"In addition, some people with long Covid have gotten better over time, either on their own or with the help of treatment."
2617,"Still, Dr. Al-Aly said: “What we will grapple with for years to come, maybe even for decades, is the effect of the pandemic on the long-term health of Americans.”

He added, “We got caught unprepared for Covid."
2618,Let’s not drop the ball on long Covid.”
2619,"The two most effective vaccines out are 95% and 94% effective at preventing COVID-19, so, yes, there’s still a small chance you can be infected and develop COVID-19."
2620,What would be the number to call pandemic to be over?
2621,"I mean its never going to be zero, right?"
2622,How does this number compare to influenca numbers from the past?
2623,they are heavy spreaders tho
2624,But that’s really not how it works.
2625,"Who will get infected during the 3 week extension for the 25-39 yo, and whom of those will be severely ill."
2626,"So far people below 50 doesn’t often die of covid, 2 cases until now."
2627,So with relatively low infection numbers (and lower when we get to summer) the answer is probably that it’s the right decision
2628,"yeah I got my 16YO their first shot over April vacation but the second one might screw with their AP U.S. History exam, I might see if I can push the second one just a little bit later until after that's over."
2629,"Not lots later, just a few days."
2630,Come to Texas.
2631,An article published recently in Nature finds that non-hospitalized post COVID-19 patients have a 59% increased risk of mortality within 1-6 months of infection.
2632,"The study is the largest to date of post COVID-19 patients, comparing 73,435 non-hospitalized patients with nearly 5 million controls."
2633,"However, a limitation of the study is that the Veterans Health System patients were 88% male with a median age of 61, and they were compared to a control group that was 90% male with a median age of 67."
2634,Further research is needed to determine whether there is increased mortality among non-hospitalized post COVID-19 patients in the broader population.

2637,Check out https://immunizebc.ca/ask-us/questions/does-adult-get-same-amount-vaccine-baby for some explanations for why it's often the same dosage.
2638,Anti-vax is as much a far left thing is it is a far right one.
2639,Anti-vaxxers aren't nearly as prevalent as some people on this sub seem to think.
2640,Most of the unvaccinated people in the US I would say are vaccine hesitant [(which is more common in minority communities)](https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/latest-data-on-covid-19-vaccinations-race-ethnicity/) or just don't care enough (young people)
2641,My brother (lives in Texas) told me he thinks he’s immune.
2642,From Covid.
2643,Probably.
2644,That's fine.
2645,The antivax crowd has been pretty clear about their thoughts and intentions.

2651,"and a 3rd in 6-9 months, and every year after that"
2652,Would it have been all that much trouble to add the age into the title?
2653,The spike protein is also used in the Oxford and J&amp;J vaccines via an adenovirus delivery.
2654,Here in Canada I’ve already ordered my “fully vaccinated” T-shirt to wear once I get my second shot.
2655,I do agree with some sort of “vaccination passport” to restrict those that chose not to get vaccinated.
2656,I’ve already got my first Maderna shot but second not until August.
2657,It’s good to see some decline in the US now that the rollout of the vaccine is being handled extremely well.
2658,"So, based upon published documentation, I am now 64% vaccinated."
2659,Can’t wait for my second shot so I can have that peace of mind and be able to spend time with family who have received both shots.
2660,"Getting back to normal...going out dining, shop with no problems, go to a theatre, CONCERTS, attend a football or hockey game, travel with no restrictions, etc, etc."

2670,I ate at an indoor restaurant the other day.
2671,If you’re fully vaccinated there’s really no reason why you shouldn’t go out and live your life.
2672,I see they would like to turn into India on the prairie

2682,My guess is that these state laws will be invalidated or knee capped by existing federal OSHA laws.
2683,Employees have the right to work in a safe environment that is “free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm.”
2684,I was a little hesitant for that reason and thought I might wait it out but then my university opened a vaccination clinic so yeah here I am two days post second shot lol (also the idea of waiting until summer practically to be good to go ugh)
2685,What does what US vs China has done have to do with this?
2686,I’m simply stating the elephant in the room that inactivated vaccines are a better fit for low/middle countries to manufacture and distribute.
2687,And that China and India are the ones with the patents and designs for inactivated Covid vaccine.
2688,And they also happen to have the most factories for inactivated vaccine production so why not start from there instead of waiting for months to bring factories for mRNA and adenovirus based vaccines online.
2689,[deleted]
2690,I wonder if the TriState region will drop the mask mandate/social distancing indoors &amp; outdoors stuff AFTER we reach the intended 70% goals.
2691,"That's why neither of them are talking about that right now, because we aren't there yet."
2692,So then why does Pfizer say otherwise?

2706,If they’re willing to risk it by going out that’s on them.
2707,"I’m fully vaccinated, but I’m staying away from my friends who are still social distancing or not taken the vaccine yet."
2708,"However, if you wanna see me and meet up at bar to do so or have me in your house after I tell you I’m fully vaccinated, but work with kids/have been out at the bars the risk is on you."
2709,Would you rather live in India?
2710,No restrictions there.
2711,[deleted]
2712,"Being in constant worry for two weeks over a risk that low is a you-problem, not a vaccine problem."
2713,We all care about Microsoft after getting that 2nd shot.
2714,"Yes, which makes sense because unfortunately we have - on the whole- a pretty sick population."
2715,I'm pretty sure that the countries without high obesity have done very well (in terms of Covid deaths).
2716,I'm not trying to underplay the tragedy of any of the deaths; this has been devastating for so many people.
2717,But if we treat it as an issue with overall health it's win/win: we reduce chances of people dying from Covid AND of them dying prematurely from other diseases.

3221,Can’t compare India or even South America to the rural south of the US.
3222,This virus has shown that it thrives in urban infrastructure with high population density.
3223,And these states have more or less been opened up for a while now and are still ok.
3224,"Keep in mind that Pfizer vaccine in Brazil will be restricted to the state capitals only due to logistical problems:

-- Brazil isnt able to keep the vaccines properly refrigerated outside of few specific locations, so they have to stay stockpiled and quickly distributed nearby these storage centers and used within 5 days before they go bad."
3225,"--

Brazil's bulk will still be Coronavac and AstraZeneca."
3226,Coronavac I am not a fan of.
3227,"But AstraZeneca is pretty good, and they have local production of it to, 1.2million doses a day currently."
3228,"Because that data is tied to his other personally identifiable information, which is a serious issue."

3233,Look at the statistics.
3234,"For kids under 14, it really is less deadly than then flu for them."
3235,It’s a mortality rate of 1 in a million.

3237,"https://twitter.com/vprasadmdmph/status/1374193160503529476?s=21

Too many people are reactionary about this because a Covid denier said it about adults, which is of course is incorrect."

3249,It's the same vibe as the anti-abortion nuts who tried to blow up women's health/abortion clinics.
3250,"""Albertans born between 2006 and 2009 who have underlying health conditions are now able to receive the Pfizer vaccine."
3251,Alberta Health Services approved the vaccine for use in people under 16 years old on Monday.

provinces have the ability to broaden the use of drugs and medications if there is supporting evidence."
3253,"The decision is considered off-label authorization
...

those between 12 and 15 who have conditions including chronic hearth, lung, liver, or kidney disease, qualify to receive the vaccine."

3266,He also can’t risk delaying any further given it’s an election year - the Republican candidates are salivating and ready to pounce as he delays reopenings and loosening restrictions (you can bet whomever wins the Republican primary will say they will end the mask mandate if it’s not ended by Election Day).
3267,Back in January many were thinking that the warm weather was saving India.
3268,"If the south vaccination rates remain low, it is quite possible that different variants will ravage through the south in few months."

3286,This is probably untrue.
3287,"We don’t know what level of vaccination provides herd immunity even in Winter and with no restrictions, but most experts agree it’s higher than where we are now."
3288,"If we can get to 65% of the total pop vaccinated, there’s a decent chance we’ve accomplished herd immunity."
3289,But that’s a way’s off.
3290,"People are voting for him and his party 
 for the same reasons people in US were voting for Republicans and Trump."
3291,There are similar populist trends across many countries right now.
3292,"So what's nuts is that Michigan and South Carolina had comparable vaccination rates, but Michigan had that last surge, and SC didn't."
3293,Nobody actually knows why that is.
3294,Perhaps higher levels of natural infection but that's by no means a given.
3295,Both states had plenty of cases during last years surges.
3296,"That's understandable; I sometimes have worn my mask in my car for that reason, since I don't want to keep touching it."
3297,"But for going outside without a mask to have been one of the best memories of the past 15 months, it kind of seems like they pretty much never went outside without a mask even if it was really bringing them down, and that seems like it was pretty unnecessary to put themselves through."

3305,"yea nova has basically gentrified virginia, which is great."
3306,but historically speaking they are still considered a part of the south so it is what it is.
3307,"maybe virginia could, uhhh, secede from the south or something

actually now that ive looked at the census designated regions, maryland and delaware are also considered southern states, which is hilarious to me too."
3308,"and of course, maryland and delaware are trending above the average too as far as vaccinations go"
3309,"As soon as there are business such as grocery stores near me that don't require masks, i will shop only there until other businesses follow suit"
3310,are the deaths comparable to other hotspots in terms of age range?
3311,This world is officially crazier than I could take
3312,Same
3313,Vaccination CAN get us there.
3314,But enough people have to get vaccinated.
3315,We do not know what that number is but we have some guesses and they’re all above 50% of the population.
3316,"If we get to 70% of adults and then layer on a bunch of 12-15s once they get approved, we have a decent chance of herd immunity."
3317,But remember that rate of growth is situational.
3318,We could seem fine all Summer even at a lower vaccination rate and then have a huge outbreak in the Winter (this is what happens with flu).
3319,I have difficulty fathoming how people say they don’t want to get vaccinated because it doesn’t lead to an exit strategy.
3320,IT DOES.
3321,But this is a team sport not an individual one.
3322,"The more people that get vaccinated, the better our odds are of going back to a restriction free life and soon."
3323,I’m sorry that covid has caused such difficulty in your life.
3324,I’m in California and there are definitely folks who are “waiting” or just say they won’t take it.
3325,"These are the same folks who are happy to have their parents get the
Vaccine so that overall cases will fall, and then they can go back to the gym sans masks, etc."
3326,and “live their lives” I.e.
3327,basically ride on the backs of vaccinated folks.
3328,(These are also the people who think COVID testing swabs “capture” your DNA.
3329,To what end they can’t say.)
3330,They are educated professionals in their 50s in the STEM fields!
3331,But they have no sense.
3332,And I think this turned into a rant...
3333,"Connecticut went through the same pains, and it looks like we'll be nearly restriction free (minus a mask mandate) by May 19."
3334,"I would be surprised if the mask mandate, outside of elementary and middle schools, didn't end by August."

3344,It should be done cuz it's the right thing period.
3345,So how would we find out if that is true or not?
3346,Can you link to a communication from the CDC saying that?
3347,"If true, that is very interesting."
3348,I too am wary because my kids are unvaccinated.
3349,I am waiting for the numbers in my area to go down.

3353,Uh that’s why I’m asking.
3354,Because I don’t know.
3355,Your analogy is a little ridiculous honestly; a gym trainer to a novel vaccine?
3356,I was also specifically told if I got shot 1 of Moderna to only do shot 2 of Moderna no matter if Pfizer was more accessible.
3357,"So that’s why I’m asking if the same still applies or if there are boosters, If manufacturer doesn’t matter anymore."
3358,I still do.
3359,Correct.
3360,OP is more than a week late but nonetheless this is promising progress.
3361,"However, we still have a couple billion to go before the pandemic ends."
3362,The US is only 4% of the world population.
3363,"If a vaccine-resistant strain does arise, there is a 96% chance it happens somewhere else in the world."
3364,The virus circulating among US children and US unvaccinated is only minimally adding to the overall risk of a vaccine resistant strain occurring.
3365,"Because it's not really impacting the entire risk profile very much, don't think it's something in particular we should be worried about."
3366,"I'm worried about millions and millions of infections in India and elsewhere, not the infections among US children."
3367,Put your worry where the bulk of the risk is.
3368,I don’t do flu shots but that is good to know!

3381,"Come on, there's no reason that they'll do that."
3382,It wouldn't have support from the public or businesses.
3383,&gt;The vaccine passports are (in general) not managed by the government.
3384,These are private parties collecting medical information.
3385,"Maybe in the US, not in Europe."
3386,Byeeeeeeeee!
3387,"&gt; I think in public,  I'll continue to wear a mask."
3388,Doubt
3389,Except it's easier and more seamless to just wear it outside rather than having to remember or quickly put it on every time someone comes near or you go in somewhere.
3390,At least for me it has been.
3391,I don't wear mine outside since I'm in a rural area but if I'm in an area where people will be or I'll be going in and out of places I'll just leave it on.
3392,"Yes, really."
3393,You keep sharing that link out of context.
3394,Have you read it yet?
3395,"It says each state has about 250 pediatric cases per day (88,500 nationwide over a week)."
3396,"That's not hospitalizations, and it's barely a blip of a number of cases."
3397,"Probably the most urban of states that have the least amount of ""skeptical demographics."""
3398,"My county in my state is doing great right now, but there are other major counties that aren't even rural that are doing horrible."
3399,So I know it won't be my state.
3400,Of course kids make up a larger percentage of cases since adults are being vaccinated.
3401,How did you not expect that to happen?
3402,Nowhere does it say they are flooding hospitals and ICUs.
3403,I know a woman who believes covid is caused my the masks so the less people wearing them obviously leads to less cases.

3420,"It is imperative that the U.S. government double down on this commitment by exporting these materials expeditiously, by opening its stockpile of AstraZeneca vaccines currently sitting unused on shelves, and by following the actions of other countries this weekend by shipping medical supplies including oxygen concentrators to help treat COVID-19 victims in India and other countries hardest-hit by the spread of this deadly virus*.”

""*We are currently sitting on close to 40 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine in the U.S. stockpile, a stockpile which we're not using and which we've already opened to combat COVID-19 in Mexico and Canada."

3492,"we had the moderna vaccine here in illinois, and neither my wife nor i were ever asked for payment or insurance info for either the first or second shot."
3493,i just assumed that it was/is free pretty much everywhere.
3494,It’s not the problem.
3495,"mRNA vaccines require incredibly complex manufacturing and quality control that simply can’t be replicated at a moment’s notice - if it could, it already would have happened in the US and EU."
3496,Each expansion of manufacturing capacity has been expensive and difficult to implement and has taken many months to bring online.
3497,"This IP meme has largely originated in India, as a distraction from the failures of the Indian government that factored into the latest outbreak - its much easier to blame an external bogeyman."
3498,"The Serum Institute of India, their largest vaccine maker, already has a vaccine to produce - they are limited in capacity because they are short on raw materials."
3499,An IP waiver does nothing to solve that problem.

3506,I'm a nurse at a county jail and I'm the only one vaccinated.
3507,They offered it for free to all the staff but I had already managed to get it on my own before then.
3508,i don't downvote conversations.
3509,"I don't like the premier either, but I'm not going to criticize him on this one."
3510,We just see the issue differently.
3511,"another thing to consider, you would need a large chunk the entire OPP to manage to restriction of movement in Ontario."
3512,There isn't one road that leads to each of the counties.
3513,"One top of that, people of legit reasons to be in other counties - how many exemptions would occur."
3514,"And if they did realistically enforce it you would basically have police or military state in the Province asking for proof of address, purpose of travelling etc."
3515,could you imagine how that would play out with the already large enough conspiracy theorists.
3516,I just don't see think it would work or would it be worth our efforts as a province.
3517,New Mexico
3518,"Doesn’t mean the doctor has to do it (at least I hope, I’m not sure if there is some medical law that obligates a doctor to “keep looking” if a patient “isn’t sure” they found the right disease)."
3519,It's in the NYT website.
3520,"In all 50 states, Black and Brown people are under-vaccinated."
3521,It's well documented in statistical data that they have disproportionately high rates of vaccine hesitancy.
3522,Wish the US would do this too
3523,"Capitalism is how the vaccines were created in the first place, as it turns out."
3524,Don’t be so quick to discount the very system that delivered viable mRNA vaccine platforms.
3525,No.

3540,It would be great if they could return the Kohinoor and a few trillion dollars that they looted along with the ventilators /s
3541,I’m so sorry to hear this.
3542,We have supply of equipment but not enough doctors/nurses to tend to the patients.
3543,There has been a recent push to get more doctors and nurses but sadly they should have done this last year.
3544,I don't know man.
3545,The Chinese went all out just to contain it within one province.
3546,"They were mobilizing resources from all over their country to enact and maintain those lockdowns, and if that failed to contain the virus they would have a much much more difficult time."
3547,I remember reading about those hospitals they put up in 10 days around Wuhan.
3548,"They mobilized 20,000 workers in shifts working 24/7 to put up a single hospital, and had to be able to send all the building materials and equipment in simultaneously from all across China to coordinate construction."
3549,"It was no easy task, and they could do it if all the work is centered in one place,  but if they had major outbreaks in all major cities, it would not be possible."
3550,"The Chinese smartly realized they had to go all in at the beginning to try to not just reduce the outbreak, but completely contain it."
3551,You only get that shot at the beginning.
3552,"Once the virus becomes endemic, especially in a highly populated nation like China India USA, it turns into a huge problem."
3553,The US actually got fairly lucky that the vaccine came out so fast and we have the massive cold chain infrastructure to deploy the mRNA vaccines en masse.
3554,If there is no vaccine the US would be in wave 4 by now.

3559,You told me that it’s a “chartered right” to have freedom of movement.
3560,In reality public health concerns allow for limitations on movement.
3561,You can downvote every example I give you of travel restrictions in sane places that have done better than Ontario but that doesn’t change the fact that it’s possible to have a better covid response than Ontario and that your premier made a lot of dumb mistakes that other people should NOT have to pay for with some stupid national lockdown that is never going to happen.
3562,"70% of adults vaccinated is what I said, which is different from what you said and what the goal has been for a long time now."
3563,The new census reports that [NJ has roughly 9.3 million people](https://www.njspotlight.com/2021/04/nj-population-grows-to-over-9-2-million-census-says/).
3564,The goal (which granted could shift slightly due to the extra half a million people in the recent census count) was [4.7 million](https://covid19.nj.gov/pages/vaccine?fbclid=IwAR21yn3Jyo5mapuNNhxXi3qve6PsBPEfP3mL3uTEUweEPgr5e65_iUvLVIM) fully vaccinated people which would be 70%.
3565,"[This website updates](https://covidvax.live/location/us-nj) daily and until that update, gives a best guess of how many shots were administered that day."
3566,"At time of writing we're just about 62,000 out from hitting the goal of 4.7 million."
3567,"We're still administering well past 70,000 doses daily and while they aren't all first doses, we'll probably hit 4.7 million by early to mid next week if we don't blow past it before then."
3568,After that it'll be 3-4 weeks for that group to get their second shot.
3569,So to answer your question of how long do we realistically have to wait: Not long.
3570,"No one needs to get ""bribed into it""."
3571,It'll just make it go faster for everyone but at this rate I imagine by mid June we're going to hit the 4.7 million number fully vaccinated.
3572,"Based on what happened in Israel and the UK we're going to have it completely under control in Nj well before that, but that's for another post."
3573,"Uh, as has become completely apparent in the last few months, the problem with vaccine supply is raw materials and quality control;  neither of these are IP related."
3574,We’ll scale up a lot more quickly if we manufacture doses for export than if emerging markets are suddenly expected to be able to magic an incredibly complex manufacturing supply chain into existence overnight.
3575,"Even India, the “world’s pharmacy” with enough factory capacity, is constrained by raw materials, not intellectual property."
3576,This initiative isn’t really about a GoFundMe for buying vaccine doses.
3577,"It’s a roundabout way to help people realize what a privilege they have by living in the first world, and to encourage them to value the vaccines they can get for free enough to actually take the time to get vaccinated."
3578,"There’s a big psychological difference between “always free for everyone” and “this item has monetary value, but you, specifically, get it for free if you take action”."
3579,Bill Gates isn’t a shit goblin - he’s trying to help solve the vaccine hesitancy problem while also getting as many resources as possible to COVAX.
3580,Central Oregon is leading the region in cases.
3581,Very unfortunate.

3586,"There's a large military base there, and they aren't requiring vaccines yet (not until it's fully authorized by the FDA)."
3587,"Between friends and family in various branches, and guardsmen I've personally spoken to at vaccine sites, it sounds like only a minority of enlisted soldiers are getting vaccinated, and basically only masking up when required."
3588,"Otherwise they're going out, doing things like it was pre-covid."
3589,There's no way that isn't influencing these spikes in some manner.
3590,"Combine that with a rural conservative population (statistically the least like to get vaccinated), and you've got a recipe for a big spike."
3591,It’s the share of total population that has gotten at least one shot.
3592,which areas in Ontario had almost no cases prior to April 3rd?
3593,Even Northern Ontario was struggling with relatively high cases loads.
3594,"North Bay couldn't come out of the grey in March because of a variant outbreak that started in an apartment building, Thunder Bay had hundreds of active cases due to the spread in the mines."
3595,Kapsuskasing had a big outbreak.
3596,Algoma was doing okay until the India variant came back with international travel and then spread though a 'last-hurrah' banger before Easter that spread through the high schools.
3597,All of those places just recently started settled down when it comes t case count.
3598,People tend to be reactive to the news of the day and forget that it took weeks for the virus to ramp up or ramp down.

3600,Actually BC is doing a small travel restriction and it’s legal.
3601,It’s just the lockdown freaks that claim that travel can’t be restricted without a national lockdown.
3602,"In reality, there have been travel restrictions that get lifted when they are no longer needed and there is neither the desire nor the need to lock the entire country down again, no matter how much a tiny number of people living in hot spots want to punish others for their failures."
3603,"I'm sorry, it definitely sucks."
3604,"We were careful, but there were a few brutally cold days at school and my daughter had no choice but to eat lunch in the crowded cafeteria, which she normally would do."
3605,We're guessing that's where she picked it up.
3606,To make matters worse on her first day back after recovering from covid one of her teachers gave her detention for being literally two steps from entering the classroom when the bell rang.
3607,Realize then that you're killing Black and Brown people who have good reason to be anti-vax.
3608,You're no better than Chauvin.
3609,"lol by all means do what you want i encourage it

please just be yourself"
3610,"I think you are confused between ICU beds and ventilators, Ontario including GTA and country as a when have huge surplus of ventilators

Sorry about your dad but they're not admitting people into ICU unless they code and/or have a good prognosis

Even without capacity crunch, many people especially older people aren't admitted because their prognosis is poor as it's very taxing on body to be admitted into ICU let alone ventilator"
3611,"I'm still trying to decide if his ""category five hurricane"" or Walensky's ""impending doom"" take aged worse."
3612,The examples you gave are all big cities.
3613,I'm sure you can find something affordable in less populated areas.
3614,"Biggest difference is that France, Germany and Italy are huge compared to the Netherlands."
3615,Easier to find some place less densely populated.
3616,"The problem in the Netherlands is in ""de randstad"", big cities and all the small towns surrounding them."
3617,"For example I live in a town of 35.000, mostly people from Amsterdam that move here because it's cheaper than Amsterdam, and all the new houses that are being build now start at €700.000 for 200 square meter."
3618,If you don't mind living like 100km from Amsterdam you can still find a house for a small family for around 200k.

3629,"Crazy, glad you got it tho!"
3630,How does that make any sense though?
3631,"It says in the article that they’re doing the negative test thing, but also seeing if this gathering increases transmission."
3632,"If you’re requiring a negative covid test to get in then all you’re going to get is either zero covid or a tiny amount through false negatives, none of which matches reality."
3633,"I mean, I guess unless the UK is planning on requiring a negative covid test to go to public events."
3634,I guess then it’d make sense.
3635,[removed]
3636,Right?
3637,It’s amazing how leading with some competence instead of scratching your ass and pretending everything is fine actually garners you some positive press.
3638,To what degree do you have to factor people with prior infection into the equation?
3639,44% vaxed + X% of Americans with post-infection immunity = total amount of people who the virus can't easily use for transmission.
3640,I know exactly how you feel on that last bit there.
3641,"The DAY I got eligible for a vaccine my roommate tested positive for covid, which was of course already passed on to me by the time she tested positive."
3642,"I was always so careful, and for so long, and so close to making it through without getting it, but  none of that matters if the people you live with aren’t careful too."
3643,It’s a clear part of the NZ border guards job to not infect the people they are suppose to protect.
3644,"I have no clue why anyone has a problem with this, unless they don’t understand NZ’s method of protecting the country from infection."
3645,"Hes never had a job, dropped out of school and is in the general sense of the word a loser and has no ambition to leave."
3646,"Man child really, if he were living in the open flat below I could understand but still having mommy do everything for you like that when you're perfectly capable is just sad"
3647,Fire/EMS %'s are also abysmally low in my area.
3648,"Not sure how it's translating across the rest of the country, but most fire fighters fit into the categories we see on vaccinate rates in anyway."
3649,Sure but that’s what Ford is doing in Ontario.
3650,It’s not the only thing possible and limiting travel is not illegal just because Ford hasn’t done it.
3651,Ontario has had a terrible outbreak in part due to poor decision making.
3652,That’s not a reason to lockdown places that have almost no cases.
3653,Yyyyyyyyyeah buddy!
3654,That would not be allowed under the ACA.
3655,I heard a year.
3656,They have almost assuredly been told they are mistaken in that regard too though.
3657,"I know all of our local LEO'S were specifically told that they needed to be vaccinated regardless of if they had previously had Covid, then they were explained to them why that was the case."
3658,"Even then, they didn't even get 50% of the departments vaccinated."
3659,The larger issue was that the officers belonged to the same demographics we see at large who are refusing to get vaccinated.
3660,"I heard there's a ""2nd generation"" Pfizer and Moderna vaccines coming out."
3661,"If I get a first dose of Pfizer or Moderna now, does that mean I'm not longer able to get this ""2nd generation"" vaccine as my second dose?"
3662,"If so, should I wait a few months to get the vaccine?"
3663,"Also, some studies are saying Pfizer has a much lower effectiveness for Asian Americans (I am one), like only \~70% compared to Moderna's \~100%, does this stat mean this vaccine is not very suitable for me?"

3665,NJ is at 66% of adults with one dose.
3666,So it wouldn't be much longer.
3667,Is it a dry cough?

3678,Tuskegee syphilis experiment is what they're most likely referring to.
3679,To a (arguably) lesser extent the whole Henrietta Lacks (of HeLa cells fame) debacle.
3680,This is one reason some people of color may be wary of vaccination efforts.
3681,"Really sucks, as people of color -as well as low income whites- are disproportionately impacted by events like a pandemic."
3682,Really hoping to get into the master's in community health I applied to and do some work to address these issues.
3683,Host genomics are important and we need more POC to take part in trials and just get vaccinated in general.

3695,Right?
3696,I still intend to wear my mask in public until health officials say we have reached herd immunity and can forego masks.
3697,I’ve spent the past year taking it seriously and following the guidelines to limit spread.
3698,I’m not about to screw it all up when we’re at the finish line
3699,Here's an optimistic data point!
3700,The UK hit 44% for first doses (where we are now) on March 25th.
3701,"That day the 7 day average of cases was 5,564."
3702,"One month later it was 2,437 and yesterday it was 2,194."
3703,"Coupling this trajectory with our current solid baseline for all the metrics and the fact that US seasonality tailwinds now should be better than the UK's were then (their spring comes pretty late), I think we are in an awesome place to hit pandemic lows for cases, hospitalizations and deaths by the end of May."
3704,I wouldn't be surprised at all if we look back on COVID as an event that significantly impacted the American public from March 2020 to May 2021 before ultimately waning into a far more manageable and less intrusive disease.

3712,Feeling optimistic.
3713,I booked a vacation for August.
3714,"Figured that gives 4 more months for things to improve, plus it’s at the end of summer break when kids are starting to go back to school, so there will hopefully thin things out a bit."
3715,What are you trying to say?
3716,[removed]
3717,I never said what was happening in Canada to children is a crisis.
3718,Those are your words.
3719,I will say that what is happening to children in Brazil with respect to COVID-19 is a crisis.
3720,But I did say that the deaths were real.
3721,You literally kept writing that they were not.
3722,And I called you out on that.
3723,I am a Toxicologist.
3724,I read the poison control reports each year.
3725,Even if it is just one person dying from a particular cause it's still worth noting for someone like me.
3726,"And as someone who has worn full face respirators in the summer, I don't find wearing a mask to help keep people alive while we work on getting more people vaccinated a major imposition."
3727,"And I am not sure what you think is happening, but having people mask up and be quarantined for a global respiratory virus pandemic is what you are supposed to do."
3728,It's what they did when my grandfather was alive.
3729,And speaking of old people.
3730,Dead.
3731,The word you are choosing not to use is dead.
3732,Kids were quarantined so old people would not get dead.
3733,And let's be honest they missed their freedom a lot longer than needed because a whole bunch of adults acted selfishly.
3734,But the kids were mostly grown ups about it.
3735,More so than a lot of the actual adults.
3736,But as someone who has seen small children mask up to see their grandpa with MRSA that doesn't surprise me.
3737,"Look, it's simple if you don't want to respect other people's right to life, which did come before liberty in that whole declaration of independence, go find an island."
3738,"But if you want to live in a society, you have to value other people's right to live."
3739,It's why they don't let you drive on the sidewalk.
3740,That is true even if it would be a teenager driving over an elderly couple on the sidewalk.
3741,Even kids don't get to experience absolute freedom because one person's freedom to sometimes has to end where another person's freedom from begins.
3742,"But hey, if you're confused about what a complete lack of human rights looks like, go look into modern day slavery."
3743,And it may shock you but a lot of us are enjoying quite a few human rights these days.

3745,Facts.
3746,Science.
3747,Powerful stuff.
3748,P.S.
3749,I also did give you a shortcut to curing hundreds of deadly disease faster.
3750,In case you're interested.
3751,[removed]
3752,Yes but we’re getting like maybe 1% increases per day now.
3753,If we are only at let’s say 40% now I realistically have to wait how long before we hit 70%???
3754,If demand is this low already.
3755,At a certain point it becomes unfair to wait around for people to be bribed into it.
3756,Population of Vietnam is 96 million.
3757,The population density of Saigon is more than NYC.
3758,Vietnam is also a much poorer country that borders China.
3759,"Yet their people have largely lived a COVID free life, treating citizens and foreigners coming down with COVID, contact tracing, testing and isolating to contain."
3760,"If more people knew how differently the pandemic could have played out, both the left and right would have demanded for better."
3761,"The excuse that those countries are too small, too different, too much like islands and the US is not-- I say think harder."
3762,Figure it out for the next pandemic.
3763,"Because it needs to be better than 5 or so countries that manage while the rest of the world languishes with, for example, American exceptionalism and German bureaucracy/lockdowns."
3764,"I'm not in charge of making that decision, just stating how Ontario got here."
3765,"I will say it's easier to control movement around the Maritimes as there is limited way to access each province than it is to police the 200,000 km of roads in Ontario."
3766,"But I'm in Northern Ontario, and this lockdown we probably didn't need based on numbers, but we've gone from 12 cases a day or less than one."
3767,So it's helped us when we look to open back up in a couple of weeks.
3768,I imagine that the colour coded regions will be implemented again and I look forward to being in the green and vaccinated.
3769,[deleted]
3770,What makes it sad?
3771,The fact that the adult children will take care of their aging parents?
3772,Or that it makes sense to save money as a joint family on housing?

3774,[removed]
3775,"I'm not from our beautiful northern neighbor, although I've visited quite a bit."
3776,You are 100% correct and that's why my state only attempted town/county level lockdowns for a minute then abandoned it.
3777,It just doesn't work because mobility is very much a thing.
3778,The only difference here is that you can't lock down state to state travel (despite Rhode Island trying it) due to our constitution.
3779,"Folks, like those down voting you, are just desperate for normalcy."
3780,"We all get that it sucks not being able to do things that you did before, but we can get there together if we work together."
3781,Am I missing something?
3782,CDC did a huge press release and loosened mask restrictions.
3783,"No more outdoor masking if you’re vaccinated, as long as it’s not a mass gathering."
3784,"Lockdowns never made sense at all in poor countries, but you said that people were starving now because of them."
3785,I'm assuming that was just made up since India has not had them in a year.
3786,"The idea that what India needs is food makes sense - distancing to negate the spread comes at a cost, and people still have to eat."
3787,But when you bring politics into it you just thwart your entire argument.
3788,I do find it funny that it irks you.
3789,Pfizer has already been opened to exports to Canada and they produce far more doses than Moderna.
3790,"&gt;if they don't announce a snap election (which is expected)

Why?"
3791,they would lose seats if they do won't they?
3792,why would they hold one?
3793,They are also population dense (compared to the US) which makes it more remarkable
3794,I'm thinking because we didn't have the lockdowns that they had we have more population with natural immunity due to infection.
3795,Maybe.
3796,"For the U.S., it might be a bit longer."
3797,I don't like how that people in this sub like to compare the U.S. to Israel when Israel had lockdowns and vaccine passports while vaccinating their population.
3798,"You know it’s funny that now that vaccines are becoming more and more available, the comments about “variants” and “mutants” increased 10 fold on this sub lol"
3799,The ones getting infected now are antivax nutjobs.
3800,Vaccines are available to all.
3801,If you're american you can come up and visit Quebec.
3802,They have their own disease named after them from all the inbreeding.
3803,"Instead of sharing methodology and utilizing additional labs around the world to increase production, ol’ Billy Biotech Gatekeeper is making sure his friends keep their IP to themselves and control production and price."
3804,This man is not to be praised
3805,THREE LIONS ON THE SHIRT
3806,"thats probably how its gonna be in certain states that have a high level of vaccinations, natural immunity, and adherence to safety measures, but not others"
3807,Isn’t copper a natural disinfectant?
3808,I’ve seen some hospitals outside the US use copper door handles and other high touch items.
3809,...and do what?
3810,"So now you’re doing the country a favor... ok. Indoor dining and gyms were open throughout covid and they contributed to a lot of spread - again, just because something is open doesn’t mean you have to go."
3811,I’m just saying that it’s kinda nice having the masks so you won’t get sick even with no covid.
3812,Airports and airplanes are notorious for getting people sick.
3813,"I've seen families who live like that, happy isn't how I'd describe it."
3814,"Nashville here, I checked and at least 40% of Davidson county has the first shot thankfully, unfortunately everyone from the surrounding counties comes here on the weekends..."
3815,The UK has been stricter about the priority order too.
3816,"It seems like there are lots of places in the US where anyone over 18 can get vaccinated, but the UK is still sticking to age groups unless someone has a health condition or works in health and social care."
3817,If a country is allowing fully vaccinated people to visit an area what would be the logic to say don't go?
3818,Especially given all the areas that have been crushed economically by covid and the lack of tourism revenue.
3819,You think we'd be doing them a favor by not going?
3820,&gt;I fail to see where I am claiming any misinformation other than my own reasoning that it was probably better for me to not take NSAIDs or Ibuprofen if I didn't really need them.
3821,"Your reasoning is being presented as based on ""fact""."
3822,The CDC has come out in multiple ways saying that ibuprofen and aspirin are fine after the shot.
3823,That they're useful for mild side effects.
3824,Multiple doctors and nurses I've spoken with have recommended both ibuprofen and aspirin afterward and they've even taken it themselves.
3825,Your reading is based on fear first and foremost and an abundance of caution second.
3826,It's not rooted in the actual words coming out of the mouths of the people you say you trust.
3827,"I suffer from medical and health anxiety too so I understand where you're coming from, but I think you could try to be a bit more even handed here and just say: ""yeah I'm anxious"" rather than:

&gt;The posts I read linked to CDC and other sites that had links to scientific research."
3828,That's what I am basing my info on.
3829,Lol.
3830,Asking about reopening too early after more than a half a million people died is dumb?
3831,You americans are such assholes and have zero empathy.
3832,Your patriotism ends at hanging a flag.
3833,Now go out there and be the best douche you can be!
3834,It’s their risk now.
3835,It was more of a problem for everyone else before the vaccine was widely available because it had a direct impact on all of us.
3836,Now it’s much less of a problem for me since I have super mRNA and most others can also acquire this superpower if they choose to.
3837,I am double vacinated.
3838,But I'm not sold on the idea of my 8 year old getting vacinated for a year or two.
3839,Do you see any value in the future that people with a normal cold wear a mask for a few days?
3840,this is what I was thinking to.
3841,it will be interesting to see what happens in the fall and winter
3842,The virus hit a brick wall of vaccines!
3843,Is this true though?
3844,We are still averaging 50k+ new cases a day in the USA.
3845,We are having a higher case load compared to our second wave.
3846,50k+ new cases a day in the USA a year later is still pretty bad.
3847,[removed]
3848,[removed]
3849,Why do you care?
3850,I would expect some loss of efficacy over a several month period with pfizer.
3851,Still should be highly effective against severe illness though for a long time including against variants I would think
3852,It’s definitely gonna get there lol.
3853,Rates are trending down hard + Summer weather likely means things will be fine in the summer in the US.
3854,States that trended up in early April have also started to trend down hard as well.
3855,Ever been to Asia?
3856,"The 3-5 year olds at daycare are onboard with masks, but yeah, I can relate to what you are saying."
3857,"Every little sniffle is an ordeal now, although it's a damn sight easier now, with close walk-in clinics with 15 min tests."
3858,"One striking thing is how many times everyone in a family has got covid, except for their 3-5 year old."
3859,"Babies, yes, older kids, yes, but the younger ones no."
3860,I know of 5 families where this has been the case.
3861,"Yes, he started in March and paused when things started getting bad and now he’s opening it up again."
3862,People are just being impatient.
3863,"And if I travel to a different state, I’m shut out of luck because there’s no cross-verification procedure."
3864,[deleted]
3865,Good.
3866,"Freedom to not vaccinate, but also freedom to get a new job."
3867,Yeah I think this is right.
3868,I do believe it will reemerge eventually but I think it's going to take multiple years
3869,"Ok, cool."
3870,"Like I say, a ton of places let you travel to and from during the pandemic - they weren’t looking out for your safety they wanted your money."
3871,Very impressive.
3872,"I know they have a very advanced healthcare system and a small geographical area to contend with, but other developed countries can learn a few things here."
3873,It's over and it's dropping like a rock
3874,Because the only way to verify is through PII checks.
3875,That’s the inherent problem.
3876,Supercross!
3877,I want to encourage everyone to donate.
3878,If we want to truly put an end to this virus once and for all we must defeat it globally.
3879,Here is the link https://gogiveone.org/
3880,And only 100 serious cases in total in the entire country.
3881,Watching the numbers fall in Israel this last month has been nothing short of incredible.
3882,They’re still administering 5-12k shots a day in the country which is better than nothing.
3883,The virus had effectively been defeated there.
3884,Once kids can get vaccinated it will never meaningfully spread there again.
3885,You can say it.
3886,It's a nothing burger when you have immunity end of story
3887,Not a chance
3888,Gosh you’re dramatic 🤣
3889,adjusted for 1.4 billion thats not a lot though?
3890,So why all the horrifying news and images??
3891,Something does not add up.
3892,I wonder why have we got to a point where believing official covid numbers has become so hard.
3893,That’s awesome
3894,As noted above this is just because you did a good job early on that you have less natural immunity in the population
3895,"But continue to wear your mask, socially distance, and avoid large, indoor crowds for now."
3896,It will be fine.
3897,In fact the exact reason Washington did so well is why they're having issues now.
3898,Less natural immunity in the population
3899,"Walgreens gives COVID vaccines now, and has been for a couple of months."
3900,So then what’s the end goal?
3901,People who aren’t going to get aren’t going to now and it’s ridiculous that those of us who have been responsible for more than a year and who have gotten vaccines are being held back.
3902,This isn’t a tenable situation.
3903,"Not impossible, expect a vaccine resistant polio is just as likely though."
3904,It is the governors job to take input from multiple sources and make decisions based risk reward.
3905,One study at OHSU which she exaggerated the results and then ignored other consequences of the shutdown.
3906,In February she decided to vaccinate teachers that were not even in school ahead of thousands of elderly people.
3907,She made a political decision that surely cost lives.
3908,I would guess she had studies that would tell her this impact.
3909,Can't let down until you get everyone vaccinated.
3910,The variants were never a serious concern for the US vaccines.
3911,"The variants probably reduce efficacy by a bit, but most likely by not enough to raise the reproductive rate over 1, which means that herd immunity will stay."
3912,I agree this is going to be over in the US very soon.
3913,Cases will exist but the deaths will be negligible and blend in with the thousands of other infectious diseases rather than being the king killing hundreds of thousands a year
3914,"Canada's problem is staff and hospital capacity, not equipment"
3915,The people who aren’t getting the vaccine are already treating life as normal though
3916,I guess in world of ignorance even sarcasm is too much.
3917,Jeez.
3918,COVID is endemic and is not going away.
3919,"The difference now is that as of today in the US, most people can walk into wal-mart with no appointment and get vaccinated which is basically 100% effective against negative impacts from COVID."
3920,"For those that choose not to, it’s on them and they assume the risk."
3921,"For the rest of us, life is going to get back to normal pretty fast and we should be celebrating this miraculous medical achievement."
3922,It seems that anti-vaxxers ought to be put on the terror watch list now.
3923,I'm not sure if they put the anti-abortionists as well.
3924,"These groups tend to attract single minded individual who, now with their echo chambers on the internet, are more likely to act with violence."
3925,For those of you reading this thinking “how can they be sending these abroad when there’s so many sick back home?” Let me give some perspective from here in B.C.
3926,Again this applies only to B.C but I wouldn’t doubt that the situations are similar nationwide.
3927,According to a recent press conference about a week or two ago.
3928,B.C bolstered their ventilator capacity significantly (almost triple I believe).
3929,Couple that with people being less sick during the third wave.
3930,(Still being hospitalized but symptoms being less severe).
3931,During this press conference they stated that they still had %80 ventilator capacity despite hospitals and ICU’s being stressed.
3932,So we’re in a position to send these machines while still having a significant buffer back home.
3933,"India needs these more than we do, things are much more dire there."
3934,I do not because we don’t automatically issue everyone a free voter ID with no effort required when they turn 18.
3935,"We give people vaccine cards when they are vaccinated, with no hassle involved."
3936,"Edit:  also, the Covid pandemic is a real, ongoing public health crisis."
3937,"Voter fraud functionally never happens in levels can influence elections, so voterID is a solution to a problem that doesn’t exist."
3938,"Weirdly, Reddit is still pretty US centric."
3939,Oregon here— we’re in the exact same boat.
3940,Definitely feels weird at the moment.
3941,Thanks for reminding me how nice it is to exit the stages of life where you give a shit about peer pressure.
3942,1.
3943,I have zero problem segregating vaccine refusers from participating in normal life.
3944,I don’t want to endanger our society as a whole because of some selfish people.
3945,I see the segregation or coercion as features.
3946,2.
3947,"I’m not really concerned with the slippery slope, but I will say that I wouldn’t mind if we required more vaccinations in the same way that we require students to be current."
3948,The public health benefit of a fully vaccinated population is massive and we saw the danger of lapsing heard immunity just a couple of years ago with those measles outbreaks.
3949,3.
3950,NY is running a state sponsored pass system.
3951,I would rather see states do it (I don’t care if they subcontract) because that makes the system much more secure.
3952,The state has the records of who has been vaccinated so they are in the best position to verify vaccine status.
3953,Maybe but you're making a ton of assumptions.
3954,My August Iceland trip is still a go as Iceland only needs your proof of vaccination.
3955,Can’t believe how much people are still whining about masks.
3956,"13 months ago if you’d told me that goddamned *masks* would be the reason people turned into toddlers and provided thousands of hours of public-freakout content during the pandemic, I wouldn’t have believed it."
3957,"If you told me people would still be bitching about it 13 months later, I wouldn’t have believed it."
3958,I must be missing some vital component of my ego that would otherwise cause me to feel oppressed and like less of a person because of a square of paper covering my nose and mouth.
3959,"PS., as someone who used to get a cold on every goddamned flight, yes, I will be wearing a mask and using some of that First Defence nasal virus gel (UK product, existed before pandemic) on flights going forward."
3960,"If strangers want to share their opinions about it with me, I will assume they have a lack of hobbies, and maybe suggest some."
3961,"Yeah, my governor (RI) has said that if health recommendations or the data change, masks won’t be required in K-12 schools in the fall but as of right now they’re operating under the assumption that they will be."
3962,"I’m hoping that my college requires vaccination and doesn’t need to require masks because of it, but it honestly wouldn’t be the end of the world to wear them for a few more months in class."
3963,"Yea idk, 101 million vaccinated, not sure on the number of people who have contracted and recovered, also many who didn’t go back for second shot for whatever reason."
3964,"WA will come through this ok, I think."
3965,"A few weeks of people being careful, and that will do it."
3966,Perhaps we should think about how much we would have been happy to pay for a vaccine that we got for free and donate some of that money to make sure that more people get access to vaccines
3967,Actually if you have any scientific background you would understand that there are way too many variables to control in this study.
3968,"Masks, distance, capacity, enforcement, on and on."
3969,Let’s look at Oregon.
3970,13 months in do we have any data that shows an outbreak at restaurants especially now that workers have the option to be vaccinated.
3971,There are outbreaks at factories and nursing homes and churches but show me a study of an outbreak at restaurants.
3972,N does not equal 1.
3973,I believe there are nearly 4 million people in Utah.
3974,"Let’s look at Texas too, oh and 49 other states that aren’t locked down right now."
3975,Not sure where you got your science education or common sense.
3976,Hopefully that's the US in 2-3 months relative to population.
3977,[removed]
3978,"I recommend you look it up after you get home from work, it's gonna take a minute for you to get up to speed on how these work."
3979,"They have your cells produce the antigen, it is presented to the immune system which then responds to it like the real deal, I think you are confusing antibody with antigen."
3980,"And what you're probably thinking of is neutralizing antibodies instead of just ""antibodies"""
3981,This water is wet line is getting so old
3982,"There are huge regional differences within those areas, though."
3983,"San Francisco Bay Area is over 70% with at least 1 dose, for example."
3984,"Many of the large population areas are going to get to herd immunity, freeing up hospit resources for the other areas."
3985,Moderna basically *can’t* enforce parents here without having a big stink raised as the US Federal Government is part owners of a few critical patents.
3986,"Donate here: [https://gogiveone.org/](https://gogiveone.org/)

&gt;The money raised goes to an international fund called COVAX AMC, which buys COVID-19 vaccines for the world, prioritizing those who need them the most in countries that cannot afford them."
3987,"I'm not calling the whole variant thing a 'nothing burger' by any means, but seems they aren't amounting to much so far."
3988,Vaccinations + natural immunity from infection is starting to really add up.
3989,And perhaps we slightly got ahead of the variant variable as a result.
3990,"Dunno, but I think within 2 full months, this won't be referred to as a 'pandemic' anymore...."
3991,"I also had friends who owned the words, but much like other names used to bully and abuse, these words are only really ok when coming from someone belonging to that supposed group."
3992,Your friend could use it.
3993,"You shouldn't, in my opinion as someone who generally prefers not to demean people."
3994,"When your friend used it, it was funny."
3995,"If you used it, you would have sounded like a jerk."
3996,"At least to me, if I was the little girl in the next one over."
3997,Well I’m kinda starting to be curious about what the best course of action will be if enough idiots refuse.
3998,What then?
3999,If we end the need for so much of the population to be vaccinated then I wouldn’t see a need for these things.
4000,But that is a big IF and I would like to see people who are refusing the vaccine feel a lot more pressure to get it.
4001,This post appears to be about vaccines.

4065,* The CDC reports vaccinations for the 0-17 age group.
4066,"The 16-17 age group is calculated using 2019 Census estimates that about 11.4% of those aged 0 to 17 are ages 16 and 17, assuming that all 0-17 age group doses were given to those ages 16 or 17."
4067,no different to the fine for travelling between states.

4069,Ah yes let’s share our already limited vaccine supply /s.
4070,"I feel for India I really do, but Canadians at home are our priority."
4071,We bought enough vaccine to cover our population 5 times over.
4072,Once we’re vaccinated we’ll share our orders with those in need.
4073,It’s funny how the media went from “We won’t be vaccinated until 2033 at this rate” to “why aren’t we sharing!
4074,!”
4075,"40k Aussies are only the ones who have registered with DFAT, not all the Aussies who would like to return home at some point."
4076,Let alone the millions of Australians who can’t travel overseas to see their families.
4077,"There are a range of different solutions the government could work out (expanding Howard Springs, expanding hotel quarantine to low risk countries, etc.)"
4078,Taiwan and New Zealand have more than twice Australia’s current quarantine capacity per capita.
4079,"If Australia had a similar approach we could take easily take 60,000 people per month."
4080,"I’m not disagreeing with you, I just don’t think it’s possible failing the elimination of the filibuster or reconciliation, which...I mean the bot removes political posts so I’ll stop there."

4082,"Yeah, dry cough kinda feeling from my lungs almost maybe?"
4083,idk lol.
4084,So you're saying that it's light-hearted escapism by comparison?
4085,Sounds like a good reason to watch it then....
4086,"Hard to say, but I'd estimate by mid-summer we should be done with them."
4087,I do worry about the anti-vaxxers.
4088,"When I saw how many of them there were on FB, I feared the worst."
4089,Having said that the progress IS surprising me in all the right ways.
4090,Central Oregonian here.
4091,I got the first available appointment for me and I’m only 8 days past my first shot today.
4092,and if they bring in the virus and people die then those families would sue the government
4093,That's how I'll be handling masks from now on.
4094,I'll only wear when I'm sick or if it's cold weather.
4095,"But otherwise, I'm done with masks after this."
4096,"I’m not sure it’s complicated for people, just confusing and poor messaging."
4097,You show up for your shot.
4098,"If you have insurance and you’re so inclined, copy down the numbers from your insurance card."
4099,"If you don’t or don’t want to, don’t, they’ll still jab you"
4100,The virus has spread in the hotels and given the virus could become more virulent in terms of the infection rate then they will be no better than the cruise ships.
4101,The problem is that those Indians who lied made it bad for all Indians.
4102,It is not the fault of the Australian government.
4103,It is the fault of the Indians who would pay for fraud.
4104,"So Trump was the one that brought in FEMA and the National Guard to increase the rate of vaccinations from 500,000 per day to 3 million?"
4105,I thought not.
4106,I mean maybe there’s no free lunch but definitely a heavily discounted one?
4107,"Central Oregonian here, and while the rapid rise in cases is frustrating, I’d rather have it now while anyone who wants a shot has one, than back a year ago when no vaccines were available."
4108,I can tell you if you had a fever with dose 2 it was probably not placebo.
4109,Most trial participants do guess correctly
4110,Must be nice.
4111,I'm in NS and things are getting kinda crazy.
4112,We don't need a special quarantine facility.
4113,It would never get built in time and then what do you do with it afterwards?
4114,What a waste of money.
4115,"The plans on how to manage this were put in place in early 2020 and Australia was the first to call it what it is, a pandemic."
4116,"People were happy to go to India a few weeks ago and now that the virus is really taking a hold, people want to quickly come back."
4117,If 48 out of 49 Indians on a flight had the virus then that should be an indication of what every flight will be like.
4118,Even with some special facility there are 1.3billion Indians and they are our largest migrant group so any facility could be overrun as well.
4119,The infection rates dropped dramatically by Jan 2021 and no one had any idea why.
4120,Then you had moronic belief among people that we are somehow immune to the vaccine due to cross-infection and other dumb logic.
4121,Turns out we dont have any magic immunity.
4122,My sister's brother-in-law is just 34 years old and had to be admitted to hospital.
4123,Its that bad.
4124,Thats a little to unempathetic but yeah its 100% their choice not to get it and there are consequences to not getting it

4135,"Wait, something seems off about that website."
4136,It doesn't seem to match the numbers we usually see from Governor Murphy.
4137,I know a young mother in UK.
4138,The couple decided to live in UK to get support from the husband's family.
4139,Then covid.
4140,She was working remotely for me.
4141,She couldn't work very much because they closed the preschools.
4142,She couldn't get help from her in laws.
4143,Her husband actually caught the virus and they even lost a friend to it.
4144,It was doing her head in for sure.
4145,Exactly.
4146,The point of the mask is if you're asymptomatic or presymptomatic and are spreading the virus around without knowing it.
4147,"If you have any symptom, from now on, forget the mask, stay the fuck home."
4148,Really?

4154,There was the same 66k fine for crossing state borders.
4155,I am more curious as to how they came up with this number.
4156,Call it a “wellness credit” then
4157,And the 61st was a false negative.
4158,Australia is not the only country banning flights from India.
4159,It is just the fine for breaking the rules that is shocking.
4160,If 48 out of 49 people coming from India were found to have the virus upon arrival then that is pretty indicative of just how rampant it is at the moment in India.
4161,If the death rate is 3% in Australia then that means 1 or even 2 of those people will die.
4162,What about the strain from UK that was so infectious that people caught it off others in another room on the same floor.
4163,The hotels would be no better than the cruise ships.
4164,I can see a wrongful death suit against the government.
4165,And lets not forget what happened in Melbourne when it got out of the hotel.
4166,People couldn't walk more than a few blocks from their homes.
4167,&gt; I guess unless the UK is planning on requiring a negative covid test to go to public events.
4168,"Similarly to the Spain trial event, these are all various methods to trial ""vaccine/negative test passports"" and how to slowly normalize those."
4169,It's like the joke about the man that drowned in a flood asking St Peter why god didn't save him.
4170,"And St Peter saying, we sent you a truck, a boat, and helicopter, what more the did you want?"
4171,Chinese factory workers worked 12 hour shifts for months to make masks that you wouldn't wear.
4172,Public health offices begged you to social distance and you wouldn't.
4173,Vaccine manufacturers move heaven and earth to produce vaccines to protect you and you refused them.
4174,I appreciate you and your efforts to prevent spreading this disease for so long.
4175,I’m very sorry for your bad luck.
4176,"You’re a good human, /u/buttastronaut"
4177,It's almost as if vaccinations work!
4178,Who'd have thunk?
4179,I’m also feeling 13 or 14 months of wfh but I am thinking that once I can arrange a lunch or drink with a friend or coworker that I’ll be fine working remote.
4180,I’m trying to figure out what part of wanting to go back is just the pandemic isolation.
4181,"Sadly most of that number are in 2 countries, US and China, many other parts around the world is way less."
4182,"The main reason vaccines require needles is that our bodies are really quite good at keeping foreign cells and RNA out, because usually they are bacteria or viruses which will make us sick."
4183,"Our skin keeps them out, stomach acid kills them."
4184,The easiest way to bypass the bodies defenses is to poke a hole in the barrier and shove them in.
4185,Like cutting a hole in a fence and crawling through.
4186,"I mean, we’re already planning a trip to a friends beach house in a few weeks because we’re all going to be vaccinated."
4187,I’m ready to get back to a relatively normal summer in terms of hanging out with people.
4188,"Yup, I was wrong, I might get it way sooner than I thought, thanks"
4189,Australia is allowing people on expired visas to stay.
4190,I am sure that Australians overseas on expired visas don't have to leave either.
4191,Here's one person who'll never be part of that number ;p
4192,I'm aware.
4193,"Really my primary annoyance is that nobody is asking Biden what the point his ""100 Days of Masks"" was."
4194,The flight caps are related to the number of hotel rooms available for quarantine.
4195,When the government repatriated from China to Christmas Island there was criticism of racism.
4196,Then the hotel solution was worked out.
4197,If we go back to Christmas Island then how many will be flown in at a time?
4198,I understand that there are 40k Australians overseas but not all of them want to come home.
4199,If there was some concrete number then perhaps people might accept Christmas Island and perhaps do one country at a time.
4200,You're right!
4201,"I was feeling especially cynical and pessimistic, but I might get it in a month from now!"
4202,Edit: thank you!
4203,"It's not ""just because"" we did a good job early."
4204,"We also re-opened business and schools too early, after the vaccine was approved but before people actually had a chance to be vaccinated."
4205,"Also, the dominant strain here is now the British variant, which is somewhat more contagious from what I understand and can also cause re-infection ."
4206,Wow.
4207,This is a really horrible article for a few reasons.
4208,"While yes, other countries have now pledged more, Canada was one of, if not the biggest contributer per capita to COVAX in 2020."
4209,"Biden to his credit earlier this year reveresed Trump's decision to not contribute it and contributed to it with large amounts and convinced other countries, especially the EU to increase their contribution."
4210,"Canada did too, but they focused on other measures for the most part in increased funding."
4211,But Canada's 2020 funding went a long way in trying to help set up manufacdturing at Covax facilities.
4212,"Canada, while doing good on it own right now, is still nowhere near the US or UK levels of vaccination, so why would Canada be the one sharing vaccines at this point?"
4213,We'll share a decent chunk (though we are talking of trying to defer some of our deliveries).
4214,We will regardless have a ton of excess vaccines eventually.
4215,"We've pledged aid to India, some even that will get our government in some hot water with the idiotic nationalists of our country."
4216,We may be able do more.
4217,But it's also not like we are in the clear here.
4218,"We have a province that is on par, if not exceeding India's per capita daily infection rate (granted, REPORTED infection rate)."
4219,But we're still sending aid.
4220,But we currently don't have the vaccines to spare.
4221,"If we had a vaccine producer, and India purchased vaccines from them, I'd hope we returned the favour and didn't interfere with the export of those vaccines, but we don't."
4222,And we aren't complaining about the SII not sending over the 1 million doses we purchased to be delivered in April or the 500k that were supposed to be delivered this month.
4223,It's understandable at this point.
4224,"Wait, what?"
4225,How can Canada share vaccines they don't have?
4226,"Uh oh, saying good things about anything done under the Trump administration is case for immediate cancelation!"
4227,"No, you should get the vaccine as soon as it’s available."
4228,The mRNA vaccines appear to have good effectiveness against all known variants.
4229,"If you need a booster shot (aka the “next generation” shots) later on, you will likely be able to get it without difficulty."
4230,It’s not worth the risk to hold off.
4231,I have not heard of any study showing differences in efficacy based on race.
4232,Do you have a link?
4233,"Unless you work in the medical field, you're making shit up."
4234,First there is no such thing as HIPPA.
4235,It's HIPAA.

4240,Agreed
4241,Can you get to the US for a second dose before you go?
4242,There have been a handful of Canadians posting on the daily thread over the last month or so about flying over for their second dose.
4243,It may involve a quarantine when you return back to Canada from the US.
4244,I’m not sure the logistics but apparently it’s being done sometimes.
4245,Just ignore them.
4246,No reason to care so much you make a post to complain.

4253,"Creatinine clearance is used to measure kidney function, I've never seen a study that suggests that creatinine is actually *causing* kidney damage."

4255,"We are almost there, should see serious effects of that by latter half of this month I feel"
4256,Monetary incentives.
4257,I'm curious why you think parts of VT and NH are close to herd immunity?
4258,If you have no social life or job then lock yourself down.
4259,Vaccinate then open the fuck up.
4260,We mostly have herd immunity to the flu but there are tiny minority immune compromised people that the flu can still kill.
4261,Do we shut down society for them too?
4262,"the article we discussing does talk about a country-wide lock down, but let's be honest, that is never going to happen."
4263,Public Health is squarely defined in the Constitution of Canada as provincial matter and the Feds have shown no interest in introducing emergency measures to override it; nor should they.
4264,a  I also didn't suggest we should either.
4265,"I was just saying, concentrating solely on isolating hotspots within a province or territory will not solve the problem either."
4266,I don’t see why not.
4267,The amount of vaccines needed for a fun international event that many people worked so hard for is a drop in the bucket compared to the total amount of vaccines in existence.
4268,The world has already given out 1 billion doses after all.
4269,It’s not the athlete’s fault the Japanese government failed.

4336,"However, I'd imagine that within 4 months Australia will also get off its ass and start vaccinating people at high rates, and you'll have options there including Pfizer (they have bought some Pfizer)."
4337,"High efficacy after dose 1 of Pfizer has been shown, so at least you'd have that."
4338,"You wouldn't have a ""fully vaccinated"" card for vaccine passport purpose, though."
4339,"If you get something different later, multiple vaccine types won't hurt you, in fact it's possibly you might be better off with a few slightly different antibodies in you."
4340,"&gt;Previous studies have shown a similar effect when cells were exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, but this is the first study to show that the damage occurs when cells are exposed to the spike protein on its own."

4348,"Question, I thought the spike protein by itself was harmless."
4349,"Does the paper just imply the spike protein is used BY the virus to attack the vascular system, or does the spike protein itself cause the damage?"
4350,"If so, isn't this a big concern for both the Adenovirus and mRNA vaccines whose entire purpose is to produce a metric ton of spike proteins?"
4351,For Healthcare workers it should be your job and vaccine or no job (unless there is a really good reason).
4352,"It really never exploded here in WA anyway (few thousand cases at worst), and we're probably reaching some level of exhaustion combined with nice weather and excitement."

4358,Don’t think OP even know the difference of Asia countries
4359,I'm watching first doses deflate like a balloon.
4360,"If the trend holds it could actually extend the pandemic recovery by a month, which I'm sure nobody would be happy with."
4361,That's fantastic news.
4362,"Joke:

a thing that someone says to cause amusement or laughter, especially a story with a funny punchline."
4363,"Smoking, while leading to more deadly symptoms, actually seems correlated with something like a 20% reduction in possible infection rate (at least in initial variants)."
4364,"People wonder what the reasons might be for this, but the best arguments I've seen are outdoors behavior, social distancing (smell), spike protein receptors being shared with Nicotine and pre-existing lung damage reducing possible vectors for infection."
4365,"Smokers also get a lot more Vitamin D, something we know is positively correlated with better results, though it's miniscule compared to the complications from infection/sickness."
4366,Really curious to see the studies after all this on what exactly was happening there or if it was a fluke (virus didn't like smoke/heat?
4367,who knows!).
4368,"A note on this though...considering the rate of infection in India, a population of many smokers, and the rate of death, it's possible whatever was helpful initially is dissipated with the more infectious variant that emerged recently there."
4369,"&gt;my source is Shin Godzilla

Yeah I think I’m done talking to you"
4370,Because they don't recognize there are multiple factors involved to getting rid of covid and that we have surplus of some things and not enough of other things (like ahem vaccines and manufacturing capabilities lol)
4371,"I’ve seen Shin Godzilla, I know all about the ineptitude of the Japanese government."
4372,"However, I’m saying that the thousands of vaccines needed to safely hold the Olympics is a drop in the bucket compared to the millions needed to vaccinate Japan."
4373,"Sure it’s unfair, but life’s unfair."
4374,Do you think old people in every country should get the vaccine before young people in any country?
4375,That’s not how the world works.
4376,I'm afraid of my 2nd shot too.
4377,I had a pretty rough reaction to the first one.
4378,I'm really having to talk myself into it.
4379,Good luck.
4380,"I can't afford the $2000 return quarantine fee on top of my trip back home, but I appreciate the suggestion!"
4381,Is this actually realistic or just a current political talking point?
4382,The supply chain of materials for vaccine production is completely backed up for years apparently.
4383,How will smaller labs get enough supplies to make this feasible?
4384,Also how would they make enough money to cover the expenses?
4385,"And lastly, how many smaller labs are actually equipped to safely mass produce vaccines?"
4386,[removed]
4387,You have to also account for people with prior infections.
4388,They would add to that herd immunity total significantly.
4389,"I think 60% is probably the tipping point, as it's quite likely 10% of the population were exposed based on the numbers we've seen and the likelihood of underrepresentation."
4390,"We're at about 50% right now, but the required number goes down every day that more people get sick or get vaccinated."
4391,Just a matter of time at this point.
4392,"Now whether we need to vaccinate annually or if it'll stick like with SARS, we won't know for some time."
4393,"I'm in Canada where the interval between first and second dose at the moment is mandated at 4 months (the gov't wants first dose saturation first), so out of luck on that front :("
4394,It makes perfect sense with cases spiking though.
4395,Everyone’s at risk family members who aren’t insane have gotten the shot.
4396,Majority of population doesn’t need to really fear the virus.
4397,"I know 30% can have shitty scary long haul symptoms and I didn’t act this way, but it’s the first freedom for many people in a long time."
4398,Same thing happened in Israel

4402,Woot woot!
4403,"I saw another commenter point out that the federal government purchased 40,000 ventilators during the first wave and they’ve received over 20,000 from that order."
4404,That’s probably on top of what provinces have already purchased themselves.
4405,And we have domestic production of ventilators so it’s not like we don’t have any to send.
4406,So I can’t see why people have an issue with this.
4407,"Sure, thanks man"
4408,Thanks 😊
4409,What if we started a conspiracy theory that the Chinese/Iranian/whatever spooky government of the day is behind the anti-vaccine campaign as a way to weaken the defensive capabilities of the United States so they can plan for a liberal invasion?
4410,"Maybe if 40% of this country believes in ridiculous conspiracy theories, we should just use ridiculous conspiracy theories on them to flip them to pro-vaxxers."
4411,"""Vaccines are perfectly safe, but the Chinese government has smallpox tipped missiles ready for invasion and have been growing the anti-vaccine movement to ensure weapon effectiveness!"
4412,"Less vaccines ensure invasion success!"""

4436,"Well, this is a poorly written headline."
4437,"Yeah covid is a global problem, the longer other countries have it running rampant the longer there is for variants to form."
4438,We don't know what kind of variants will form and that's scary to me.. Sars was a covid.
4439,It had a 10% death rate I believe even if less transmissible.
4440,I don't want to take the chance that a more transmissible and more deadly covid mutates because we can't be bothered to help each other when we have the supplies
4441,[removed]
4442,how are there actual cases?
4443,"I thought they banned all travel into their country, including their own citizens from returning."
4444,"&gt; At the same time, attention is drawn to the contradiction that citizens of the small republic who were vaccinated with V Sputnik did not gain the freedom to travel in Italy, for example to spend holidays in Sardinia, and despite the fact that San Marino will soon become the first in Europe “free from COVID-19 “due to an advanced vaccination campaign and a small population."
4445,https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/san-marino/
4446,That's not really how vaccines work though.
4447,They work by establishing herd immunity in a population so that the virus isn't circulating uncontrolled and *everyone* is protected.
4448,So we can't reopen before that without squandering all the progress we've made to get to this point.
4449,When did i say i was emotionally attached?
4450,"lol

i just made an observation"
4451,"Oh, okay, thanks."
4452,"little known fact: people in asian countries mostly wear masks because of the smog/pollution, not because they're terrified of getting sick 

lol"
4453,What’s vaccine uptake looking like down under?
4454,I’ve been seeing a lot of chatter on r/Australia saying a good amount of people don’t want AZ.
4455,Partially because of its reputation and also because of the lack of Covid.
4456,they didn't send it out of any good-will.
4457,India paid for it.
4458,"AND to rub salt on the wound, the Chinese deliberately increased taxes on those products."
4459,I am telling you.
4460,I feel as if reddit is full of un healthy people who never like to leave their house and only can communicate via internet because they are insecure.
4461,Majority of the people I deal with “outside a house” definitely want to take their mask off asap.
4462,These people are the true definition of soft.
4463,Super soft.
4464,Can the government cut off pandemic related financial help yet?
4465,Clearly people aren't scared of covid anymore.
4466,They should go back to work.
4467,"I think this article is a bit light on info, it was not a sacking, the new contracts required them to be vaccinated."
4468,The employees didn't meet this requirement.
4469,"The employees were offered redeployment as I understand it but did not take up the options, probably not great alternative options though."
4470,The CDC (in the US) considers the Pfizer vaccine to have a 4 day grace period -- i.e.
4471,you can get the second dose up to 4 days early and still be considered valid fully vaccinated.
4472,Can you get Pfizer by day 17 from dose 1?
4473,"(check [here](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/pfizer/pfizer-bioNTech-faqs.html))

Also, J&amp;J probably has a restriction of not getting any other vaccines at least 14 days before or after getting the J&amp;J."
4474,"yes, of course."
4475,"it's a game of luck, variants will always pop up, how bad it is is a bit of random chance."
4476,"usually (not always) you get more spread and less virulence, but seems Indian variant spreads faster and is as virulent or even more virulent than the original strains."
4477,"a bit of a tough break coupled with bad internal policies; not discounting the poor policies, but the apparent characteristics of the new strain definitely bounced the wrong way too."

4524,"Ultimately it is the Chinese people that will have the final say whether they will continue to be ruled by the CCP, and therefore the party of course will highlight their successes in handling the pandemic."
4525,"China is not a closed society like North Korea, and large segments of the population have connections overseas and will know how differently the pandemic has affected the lives of people across the world."

4546,All vaccines have the spike as the main antigen target.
4547,Vector and mRNA vaccines force your cells to produce the spike.
4548,Inactivated virus vaccines are killed viruses with their spike on the surfaces.
4549,Novavax vaccine has a few spikes attached to a nanoparticle.

4551,There are a  few vaccines that are trying to use only parts of the spike.
4552,Peptide vaccines are called and apparently haven't been so effective.

4554,Is this a concern?

4732,Let us vaccinate as many people as possible and just live with the results.
4733,Same...didn’t the CDC also that you’d have to be in proximity to someone for 15 mins or more to contact Covid?
4734,Chances of getting Covid walking by someone were extremely low as well.

4738,I'm not sure exactly when the headache went away but it was somewhere around the 48 hour mark.

4936,"I’m a pretty liberal guy, but this reads that if the need is great enough, the patent system can be chucked aside."
4937,How might this effect R&amp;D going forward for the next pandemic?
4938,Patents either are worth inclusion or they are not.
4939,"We can’t pick and choose the situation, especially when so very many people will resist vaccination anyway."
4940,"&gt;Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the Biden administration’s top adviser on Covid-19, acknowledged the shift in experts’ thinking."
4941,"&gt;“People were getting confused and thinking you’re never going to get the infections down until you reach this mystical level of herd immunity, whatever that number is,” he said."
4942,"&gt;“That’s why we stopped using herd immunity in the classic sense,” he added."
4943,“I’m saying: Forget that for a second.
4944,"You vaccinate enough people, the infections are going to go down.”

""live with it"" is a sad surrender, but here we are I guess."
4945,I UNDERSTAND that  MOST PEOPLE don't have a particularly bad case of Covid-19.
4946,I UNDERSTAND that most people get over it without medical support.
4947,"I just hate having to gamble on my own old, fat ass' chances when I _eventually_ get it from some careless shedder."
4948,"Had my J&amp;J shot yesterday, feels like the worst hangover I ever had."
4949,I'm pretty impressed that's all that's gone wasted.
4950,"The vaccines have to be shipped, stored, handled, administered, scheduled (twice!)"
4951,to pharmacies and vaccine centers all over the world.
4952,"Hundeds of thousands of rushed doses for over 1,100,000,000 doses administered is really *not that bad*."
4953,"The CCP does lots of things to be critiqued, I'm just tired of the utterly unnuanced circlejerk everytime literally anything chinese is mentioned."
4954,[removed]
4955,What happened to immune protection for those who have already had the virus?
4956,"If you vaccinate 70%, and half the remaining people have gotten the virus at some point before, then you should be at 85%, really, and you'd have herd immunity."
4957,"The cold viruses get around this by mutating fast enough, but so far vaccine protection has mostly worked on new covid variants, so it's not insane to think that naturally developed immune protection is similarly broad."
4958,So it seems like natural immunity certainly has some role to play as part of the herd immunity calculation.
4959,"Perhaps like the cold it's not enough, but perhaps not."
4960,The article does not say.
4961,I would have liked to see that addressed and I'm disappointed not to see it even considered.

4963,"&gt; It's free for all in the US, but fairly complicated."
4964,Why did this post get upvoted?
4965,"This is completely untrue, at this point, they just give it you."
4966,"In many states, you don't even need an appointment just show up."
4967,"Yeah, I get that."
4968,And it's valid criticism.
4969,"Although, I do think your comment seems a bit blanket against every kind of criticism against the CCP."

5240,"And before anybody complains: yes, that is most definitely NOT the same thing as saying 5% will catch it."
5241,Even most unvaccinated people haven't caught it.
5242,"&gt;If you're doing medicine for the money in the UK, you're doing it for the wrong reasons."
5243,That's crazy.
5244,One only needs to look at teachers to see the long term effects of vastly underpaying professions that are both critical and specialized.
5245,"I mean, at least right now it’s worse."
5246,"The long-COVID sufferers might have significant health impacts forever (we don’t know yet—it’s been less than 2 years), which is not something that happens with the flu."
5247,"Hopefully, advances in treatments will improve those outcomes."
5248,"COVID also seems to be more contagious, but that could be because it is novel."
5249,"But in terms of hospitalizations and deaths, we can probably expect similar numbers for the foreseeable future."

5251,"No jab, no sporting events?"
5252,"No jab, no movies?"

5254,"There's nothing wrong with requiring that people vaccinated to participate in optional, recreational activities where they are going to be sharing air with a significant number of others."
5255,"They can still choose to not put the vaccine into their bodies or not; we just attach a penalty to the stupid, irresponsible choice."

5271,"&gt; Johnson &amp; Johnson is the vaccine that Denmark (EU) has purchased the most of

Source?"
5272,Last I read Denmark was the second biggest buyer of Pfizer-BioNTech after Malta with about 25% more than the EU median.
5273,"Germany gets about 50M Pfizer-BioNTech in Q2, only 10M J&amp;J. I doubt the ratio will be massively different for Denmark."
5274,I heard Holland went big on J&amp;J - maybe because it's developed and produced there.
5275,Do you want to wait till they have vacinated at least 100 K before proceeding.
5276,That actually may be true.
5277,In my head if high levels mean your kidneys aren’t functioning properly then I assumed that means high levels are bad for you.
5278,Kind of like how if you detect high levels of iron in the blood then that is toxic.
5279,"It might not actually be the case, just how it made sense in my mind."
5280,The only reason we put up with the flu is because we have too.
5281,Influenza mutates so quickly that our best vaccines only protect up to 40% and must be produced every year.
5282,Coronavirus is not like that we have multiple 90% plus vaccines with a virus that would probably give us 5 to 10 years between potential vaccine evading mutations.
5283,We can beat Covid we cannot beat the flu.
5284,Also future surges of covid can and will kill far more people than even a bad flu season.
5285,You cannot compare the situation of these two viruses.
5286,Any and all discussion about natural immunity left the building once vaccines had been approved.
5287,"It’s unfortunate, but the government has left a very very large group of people left to wonder, am I safe?"
5288,"How long does it last, can I get it again (is there data), etc etc."

5291,I’m so excited to get my 12 and 14 yr olds their vaccine.
5292,My 9 yr old will be sure to let me know how unfair it is.
5293,Doubt it.
5294,Wow that is going to slowdown the vacccine effort in Denmark quite a bit.
5295,Thank god The Netherlands on the other hand decided to use the J&amp;J vaccine.
5296,This is US pharmacies only.
5297,"So closer to the 240 million, than 1.1 billion."
5298,eventually once they lower the age eligibility to receive the vaccine herd immunity will be achieved.
5299,Reddit moment.
5300,I disagree.
5301,"At least where I live (Virginia), if you're young, its easier to get an appointment via CVS than via the county."
5302,"The only thing is, you need to be perseverant and maybe wake up very early to schedule an appointment."
5303,"As long as you're willing to do that, you can usually get an appointment fairly fast."
5304,[removed]
5305,And if they said F' off we're not going to vaccinate anyone?
5306,We'd be much worse off.
5307,On the scale they're vaccinating people I'm sure it's a very small percentage.
5308,My brother in law has a CRP of 35.

5318,Bigger issue to me is where are these new vaccines going to be made and with what?
5319,"The “west” is going full bore on a variety of vaccines, India’s huge players already have the rights to at least one approved vaccine."
5320,Same for China and Russia.
5321,Where are these factories that are just sitting idle waiting for a patent to be waived?
5322,And if they exist where are the raw materials to supply them?
5323,[deleted]
5324,This is a ridiculous suggestion.
5325,"I don’t understand why, because someone else is afraid, should that mean everyone else has to follow the protocols that make “said” person happy."
5326,"No jab, no job?"
5327,Are you listening to yourself?
5328,"Forcing people to put something into their body, is absolutely absurd."
5329,"You need to wake up to the reality, and the reality is that people must be allowed to choose what does and doesn’t go into their body."
5330,That’s it.
5331,There’s no argument around it.
5332,"No vaccine for stupid, unfortunately."
5333,"On the scale they've been ""jabbing"" people this is a small amount."
5334,Without the help of these pharmacies chains we'd be in much worse shape at the moment.
5335,I don't think this is a fair article all things considered.
5336,I found exactly the opposite.
5337,Got both rounds done through CVS.
5338,Their appointments reset in the early am
5339,That’s not what he is saying.
5340,"In most countries, the benefits of the vaccine far outweigh the downsides."
5341,"However, in Denmark this is not the case."
5342,The health authorities have calculated that including both AZ and J&amp;J in the mass vaccination programme will likely cause more deaths than not vaccinating due to the low incidence of virus spread in the country.
5343,Most probably both AZ and J&amp;J will be available on a voluntary basis soon so anyone who wishes to have the above mentioned vaccines can get them.
5344,"Sorry, you are right, the vaccine is on break, but not recommended to 65min, which means very little in Sweden as 65+ is already vaccinated."
5345,how?
5346,and yet we shut down one year the flu basically vanished in some places
5347,This is a terrible article designed only to scare people.
5348,But this is the state of journalism these days
5349,No worries at all.
5350,I wrote that in a very confusing way.
5351,"Also, I get very confused with pre- and a-symptomatic."
5352,"The way I understood it, the parents were over in the morning."
5353,"Played with the kids, had breakfast, etc."
5354,My friend's daughter started coughing and feeling ill in the afternoon.
5355,"The kid usually gets the flu every year, so my friend took her to the doctor."
5356,"The doctor tested her, just to be safe."
5357,"On the drive home, the Dr. called and said she was positive and recommended a PCR (or whatever the regular test is.)"
5358,"Friend called her hubby, said ""you better come home""... within a day or so they all were sick."
5359,"The parents, to be safe - this was a month or two ago so there was still questions around the vaccine, etc."
5360,- got tested.
5361,They both tested negative.
5362,~~fears~~ near certainty
5363,Happy Birthday and congratulations!
5364,"Me, my parents, my grandparents, didn't have any side effects whatsoever."
5365,"As for me, I consider myself young (30 y/o)."
5366,"No, I’m not saying that at all."
5367,I’m just saying that VITT is a quite unique side effect that is not similar to regular blood clots.
5368,So far it seems like the risk is 1 to 500K which seems like an extremely small risk.
5369,"At this point in Denmark they have to consider the following: which risk is greater, side effect of the vaccine, vs risk of covid complications caused by waiting some extra weeks for a different vaccine."
5370,Bring on the vaccine passports!
5371,I guess beggars can be choosers after all.
5372,Is there is need to double mask indoors after you are fully vaccinated?
5373,"&gt;And if we're letting everyone back in

See title."

5375,Sweden hasn’t stopped.
5376,We just haven’t recieved any deliveries.
5377,"J&amp;J is still recommended for those aged 65 and up, of which almost all have now had a shot."
5378,"I’m hoping that they will let under-65s volunteer to take the vaccines, many would surely take them."

CFR (case fatality ratio) stable, other measures (hospitalizations, cases in general) in retreat."
5384,"Except that the real world performance is nearly indistinguishable, and the only deaths that have occurred through breakthrough cases have been people who are 65+ years old."
5385,"So, yeah, I'd say your chances of not dying from COVID are damn near 100%."
5386,I can add my experience.
5387,The only side sure side effect I had from either shot was a sore arm not even bad enough to affect what I could do.
5388,Lasted 2-3 days after the 1st shot.
5389,Barely a day after the 2nd shot.
5390,"I may have felt more lethargic after the 1st shot for a day, but that could have just been a poor night of sleep."
5391,"&gt;about the lack of side effects

Oh, there are plenty of side effects (fever, chills in most patients), especially if you're young."
5392,However all of those effects vanish three days after vaccine shot.
5393,"So it's not like 'take the pill, you won't notice anything', Gam-COVID-Vac is something you should be ready for \[if you're young\]"
5394,Let’s get it in and start testing the younger kids.
5395,I have a 5 year old and I’m super anxious for him to get it.
5396,Currently under quarantine because one of the kids in his school pod had covid last week.
5397,This sucks.
5398,"The ACA only allows insurance companies to discriminately charge higher premiums based on tobacco use, age, family coverage, and geography."
5399,"Since “vaccination status” isn’t here, insurance companies can’t raise prices based on that."
5400,Probably.
5401,That's been the case for the variants so far.
5402,I'm sure one will come along for which that's not the case but updating the vaccine is a lot easier than starting from scratch.
5403,"Great, then you get my compliance in mitigation measure until 2 weeks after my second vaccine."
5404,"If we won't reach herd immunity, what's the point in prolonging this all, let's get back to normal now then."
5405,We were making effective fires long before we able to scientifically describe what was happening at a molecular level in fire.
5406,You don't need to fully understand something to understand how to effectively use it.
5407,It’s almost impossible to schedule a vaccine though them compared to the mass vaccination clinics.
5408,The miracle of mRNA vaccines is here.
5409,You only need to know that it's a disease worth making a vaccine for and you need a sample of the virus/bacteria/whatever.
5410,"Actually you don't need a sample really, you only need someone to give you the genetic sequence of the antigen(virus/bacteria), you don't need to have any of it shipped to you or anything."
5411,Much safer to send an email of the genetic sequence than to send actual virus.
5412,"From there you can test all sorts of ideas about which parts of the sequence should be in the vaccine, starting in mice or hamsters."
5413,"Then monkeys, and then humans."

5426,It's still better than getting COVID and all of the potential long-term ramifications of it.
5427,Currently 60+ YOs are invited to Pfizer-Biontech vaccinations.
5428,So I guess we’ve run out of old people to use the AZ and J&amp;J vaccines on.

5436,So you’re saying the rigorous scientific trials that the vaccine passes didn’t sufficiently prove safety and efficacy?
5437,That it wasn’t just a bunch of media hype surrounding a few corner cases fueling anti vax paranoia?
5438,That it’s good enough for US military personnel but not good enough for Scandinavians?
5439,The vaccine can be fine and Pfizer still a bloodsucking leech of a company.

5452,This is great news!

5467,Most business owners will welcome everyone as it makes them more money after struggling for over a year.

5470,It’s not surprising no good models or retroactive explanations have been able to explain cause it’s a multi factorial problem where a lot of the factors are extremely hard to meaningfully quantify.

5497,"The following day Breton, a former head of multinationals including France Telecom and Atos, was made head of a new EU vaccine task force."
5498,"&gt; “At that point the challenges were quite fundamental: getting transparency about what kind of capacity was operational,” said an EU official of the task facing Breton."
5499,“Where are these factories and where they are going and what the bottlenecks were.
5500,A lot of work to do in a short space of time.
5501,"It was primarily mapping.”

&gt; Since then, EU diplomats representing the member states have spoken admiringly of a hands-on approach that has produced results."
5502,"“Breton has been to factories where even the CEOs of companies have not visited,” said one diplomat."
5503,"&gt; During a visit to a “fill and finish” site in Barcelona that is serving the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, Breton was told that a lack of filters risked delaying the final stages of production by four weeks."
5504,He used his direct contact with the chief executive of the German supplier Merck to find a fix.
5505,Fascinating.
5506,Thank Breton
5507,It says 27% of residents are fully vaccinated.
5508,710k are fully vaccinated and 1663k doses have been administered.

5515,He also *has explicitly funded zero-royalty vaccine production in India of the AstraZeneca vaccine*.
5516,"See 10:34 in this interview:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grv1RJkdyqI

&gt;	G: Well the making a safe vaccine is more complicated than say making a jet engine and people are very picky about vaccines in fact you could ruin the reputation of vaccines if you're making them in factories where the quality control at every stage is not exquisite."
5517,and you know any mistake you know you can have that factory shut down literally for months at a time when its output is needed to save millions of lives.
5518,"So vaccine factories are not something that you just you know you know like open source code that you can take and you know mess around with and so the the limitations on how many vaccines are being made, that's based on how many great capable vaccine manufacturers there are in the world 

&gt;	**and we’ve made sure that the AstraZeneca’s being made in these big indian factories and there’s no royalty for that, no charge at all."
5519,"Now we’ve had to fund that, the Gates Foundation."
5520,"These are companies we’ve been working on their factory quality for over a decade so that there was spare capacity to make inexpensive vaccines so Oxford University is is wonderful, but they’re not capable of doing a phase three trial and they they don’t have factories**

&gt;	We did tell Oxford that they needed to seek somebody with expertise and AstraZeneca came in and we didn't control that agreement but they came in and said hey they want to do it on a non-profit basis and I'm impressed with how they put their best people on it and helped out."

5525,But hm.
5526,Interesting.
5527,It'll be a race against time to see what happens first: enough businesses do a vaccine passport system to normalize it vs. enough vaccines happen and cases drop so that it becomes untenable to have those restrictions
5528,For emergency use or just approving it?
5529,"Article makes it seem like it's approved for use, but AFAIK it's not FDA approved for 16+ yet, it's only approved ""for emergency use"" which will likely have serious legal implications once schools start to require vaccinations."
5530,That’s the thing.
5531,"Just because FL won’t use one doesn’t mean that other places won’t, and those folks in FL are going to have a rude awakening."
5532,Vaccine dosage is different from traditional meds because they've never really found a difference depending on weight or BMI.
5533,They checked for any difference in the trials based on BMI and they found nothing.
5534,"As a 250lb man, the only difference I'll have from you getting vaccinated is that I'll have a bigger needle."
5535,"It kinda makes sense because me being fat doesn't make me less likely to get sick, and a vaccine just simulates you getting sick to train your immune system."
5536,"That being said, I do hope that your doctors get better about prescribing more appropriate doses, that's BS."

5538,Team sports are happening in Japan.
5539,If the teams show up a week early and isolate I wouldn't even have the slightest problem.
5540,[removed]
5541,Yeah my bad.
5542,The date of death dashboard starts a few days back which I hadn't noticed
5543,You still don't seem to understand.
5544,Literally no one has died today due to COVID in Denmark.
5545,"If we extend the pandemic by 4 weeks because of this, lets say average 1/death per day for 4 weeks -&gt; 28 deaths (and those are frail or elderly who chose NOT to take the vaccine)."
5546,"However, if we vaccinated half (or more) of our population with J&amp;J, when J&amp;J so far has cost 5 deaths (that likely wouldn't otherwise have died since they were young), that means 5 deaths in ~100.000 vaccinated by J&amp;J in Denmark."
5547,So 5x40 (half our population) = 200 deaths and even if we half that it's still more than would've died to COVID in 4 weeks in Denmark.
5548,Even if we half that again COVID _still_ wouldn't have killed as many as the vaccinations just because of the 4 extended weeks.
5549,Die spahnplatte wird es regeln 🤟😂
5550,Denmark aren’t really beggars with their consistently low case incidence
5551,Can u source that please?
5552,Got it.
5553,Thanks for the perspective!
5554,🙂
5555,Why are ppl so focused on herd immunity??
5556,Take care of yourself and move on.
5557,It can’t he argued as a HIPAA violation at all.
5558,HIPAA only applies to healthcare data.
5559,They cam ask you to provide proof and you are under no obligation to actually provide it and they can refuse service same as a business can for many reasons.
5560,AZ has had production shortfalls and so has JJ; even if AZ is much cheaper than Moderna it’s a false economy to pay for more doses than the company can actually produce/provide in the needed timeframe.
5561,They are at risk and even if they’re asymptotic they can still spread it.
5562,"By July, maybe earlier, per Cuomo."
5563,They eu keeps saying they're going to do one.

5567,Never grew again though so still 6'1
5568,"Your Canadian Moderna deliveries are coming from Europe because the US not only blocks exports of vaccines but also exports of vaccine components, which is leading to supply chain issues around the world.... except in the US."
5569,"I'm back to normal, 4.5 weeks after shot 2."
5570,I'll pop a mask on if someone near me is clearly ill because I'd rather avoid the flu/cold though.
5571,I mean that may be more of a problem with baseball than covid
5572,[deleted]
5573,It’s May 19th.
5574,This doesn’t mean there won’t be further changes as time goes on and it’s very likely given the pace of change and changing attitudes about going back to normal in the mainstream that we won’t see big changes every month.

5581,"Well, we don't have herd immunity for Tuberculosis, but how often do you worry about that?"
5582,Similar thing.

5587,Hey this is a huge step forward for Murphy.
5588,Stuff can get really out of control in Jersey quickly.
5589,I think this is a reasonable mandate.
5590,I'm sure it'll get reversed once we see no appreciable increase in cases.
5591,"I agree, but That depends on how many plague walkers there are."
5592,Herd immunity doesn't require 100% and I'm hoping the covid rats get infected and contribute to herd immunity soon.
5593,"Actually, no."
5594,"There are 2.9M cases and 29M people, so it's exactly 10% there, too."
5595,"Just because the risk is lower for kids, I would prefer them avoid getting it."
5596,The risk from the vaccine is still far less then the risk of catching covid.
5597,However the real benefit is preventing it from spreading through all the schools.
5598,Thanks for proving my point.
5599,"It's not good enough that people do the things they're asked to do, they need to think the way they're told to think as well."
5600,Smh.
5601,Yep.
5602,My 16 year old has been climbing the walls.
5603,She's about two weeks out from her 2nd dose at the moment.
5604,"Ironically she's been doing better academically than ever before this last year, and not by a small margin either."
5605,My 13 year old on the other hand is a disaster.
5606,"I can't tell if her academic struggles stem from the online friend group she's fallen into (she's been spending most of her free time ""hanging out"" virtually with 15-16 year old friends that she met through her older sister, and they aren't the best influence as far as I can tell), remote learning, or both, but in general she's a total disaster."
5607,This will be news she'll be excited to see.
5608,"Still, they both know that we're going to keep being careful until we know more."
5609,"At the moment it seems like vaccinated people don't transmit the virus, but since we have a 6 year old who may be vulnerable (she's starting to show signs of the same allergy issues that I had as a kid, and mine also revealed that I have asthma--we haven't taken her in yet as this just started showing up in the last few months and we're waiting until at least my wife and I are fully vaccinated to start making doctors appointments), getting the shot won't mean suddenly throwing our doors open to everyone and anyone."
5610,"The 16 year old is furious about this because she wants to spend every waking second with her boyfriend, but her boyfriend is from a COVID-denying, anti-mask family (who got the shot before anyone else through personal connections, imagine that), and hangs out with others that are also in that category as well as being anti-vaxxers."
5611,"Until we know for sure he can't be a carrier, he's not walking through that door."
5612,"We've offered to allow them to hang out outside, as we have a huge deck and yard, even a massive screen and projector to watch movies on the side of the house at night, but they have zero interest in that (gee, I wonder why)."
5613,All the positive vibes to you too!
5614,[removed]
5615,i don't exactly understand why the articles are arguing this.
5616,"most of them don't take getting children vaccinated into account, which is a huge percentage of the population that doesn't even have the option to get vaccinated yet."
5617,"i also see articles throwing out numbers like 90% implying that's what's needed for herd immunity, but no explanation of where they got that number."
5618,"yeah, we might not be at heard immunity this year, but it seems premature to say it's not going to happen at all when we don't even know the vaccination threshold to achieve it, what will happen with variants over the next couple years, or how much natural infection will contribute to herd immunity."
5619,ultimately it does seem like it's not guaranteed to happen though and there needs to be a plan for how coronavirus will be sustainably managed if it's endemic long term.
5620,Yeah it's funny how that happens.
5621,Might have to do with said vaccines being created.
5622,What's your point?
5623,This is my first time seeing it
5624,[removed]
5625,I thought they had been saying this was a vascular disease for awhile now?
5626,[removed]
5627,The demographics of who is anti-vax is turning out the be the exact opposite of what was being smugly talked about on reddit for like the last year lol
5628,[removed]
5629,I'm on a list at my doctor and he told me not to expect a vaccine before late July August.
5630,Too many people on that list .
5631,My mother is 69 and not even eligible to be vaccinated at a vaccine center .
5632,"It depends on what you're trying to optimize (or what we, as a society, are trying to optimize)."
5633,"Given cases, hospitalizations and deaths are highly correlated, this seems reasonable to me, as long as we don't over-focus (hey, if you test positive for COVID, we kick you out of the hospital ; look ma, no hospitalizations !)."
5634,"Focusing on hospitalizations over deaths, will probably result in more deaths :)

It would probably depend too on what you mean by opening more or less :)"
5635,Per capita that's still better than florida
5636,I believe approval is slated for fall.
5637,"I believe they are submitting the application for approval later this month, but the full approval takes roughly 6 months on an expedited schedule."
5638,[removed]
5639,Yikes!
5640,I think you’re being wise.
5641,"  

The biggest issue for USA citizen is proving you got the vaccine since people are forging CDC certs"
5642,I assume 375 power day means the death rate average will very soon be single digits and stay there hopefully
5643,Did someone say something to you?
5644,"If not, do t worry about it"
5645,I had a swollen lymph node in my armpit that took about 2 weeks to resolve
5646,I understand the importance of needing to definitively prove this but that researcher has got to be frustrated in proving things that so many people already know to be true.
5647,"“For Emergency Use”

You forgot that."
5648,Only if they want/need to.
5649,I get tested when I have to go to work or to get a haircut (for example).
5650,A travel ban?
5651,Seriously?
5652,"If everyone who wants the vaccine has access (they do), then why ban travel?"
5653,People need to take personal responsibility at some point.
5654,Deaths and cases are dropping dramatically.
5655,Once a large % of NY is immune it doesn't matter if Bob from pennsyltucky infects his cousin in NY.
5656,It won't lead to massive outbreaks and only a few who aren't vaxxed will get sick
5657,[removed]
5658,A lot of variables there.
5659,"Some teams didn’t regularly sell out seats before COVID, if teams aren’t doing well or weather isn’t great people don’t go, economic issues might mean people don’t have money for tickets..."
5660,The thing is the risk/benefit has to be measured in relation to waiting for a different vaccine not in relation to not getting it.
5661,They say removing j&amp;j will only delay the rollout 3-4 weeks.
5662,"If you can keep covid low 3-4 weeks will not incur many extra covid deaths at all, and you don't have to deal with the ethical issues and potential anti-vax arguments that arise from administering a vaccine that will likely directly be the cause of multiple deaths."
5663,It's eventually just not worth it for Denmark if they are confident they can get enough Pfizer not long after
5664,"That’s a coincidence, they believe the numbers are a lie."
5665,It’s definitely gonna get there lol.
5666,"Rates are trending down hard + Summer weather likely means things will be fine in the summer in the US, you can get vaccinated even if you already had COVID, so there it’s natural immunity + vaccinations."
5667,Here in the US.
5668,Allergies can often be cured with immunotherapy.
5669,I stopped being allergic to dust mites a few months after starting the treatment.
5670,"I love these posters that save me a click, but if the journalism is good, should we also click the article (and maybe an ad on the page?)"
5671,if we want to support the periodical?
5672,"&gt; I'm skeptical that masks are effective at reducing transmission as much as we have been told

Why?"
5673,"&gt;I'm skeptical that the vaccines are as effective as they say with such a short turnaround time

Why?"
5674,"&gt;I'm skeptical that COVID is even as big of a health risk as we have been told

Why?"
5675,None of that is skepticism.
5676,It's paranoia.
5677,"Skepticism isn't ""I don't believe it despite what all of the evidence says""."
5678,"&gt;Any of those statements, posted here on their own, would be downvoted heavily and I would be called stupid and anti-science

Because they are."
5679,Questioning for the sake of questioning is not skepticism.
5680,"&gt;Because the messaging has become so toxic that if you don't eat up everything you're told because ""scientists"" that you're literally the cause of everything bad that's happened over the past 18 months."
5681,"Yeah, you're putting scientists in quotations, you're definitely not a skeptic."
5682,You're just paranoid.
5683,&gt;that you're literally the cause of everything bad that's happened over the past 18 months.
5684,"If you've been actively going against what we're suppose to, then yes you are part of the cause."
5685,"&gt;You want people to start taking the vaccine, stop acting like uptake hesitancy makes you stupid or a bad person."
5686,Nice change of words to completely change the argument.
5687,Hesitance means they'll still get vaccinated.
5688,"You're not talking about hesitance, you're talking about anti-science paranoia with no basis in reality."
5689,"For the Flu shot I found this

https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/qa/vaxadmin.htm#what-is-correct-dose

Half dose for those under 3, full dose for everyone else"
5690,The Google tracker shows that 7.43M vaccine doses have been administered in NJ and 3.29M people are fully vaxxed.
5691,NJ population is 8.882M.
5692,Just letting people get their second doses over the next 3-4 weeks pretty much guarantees herd immunity by month end.
5693,Especially given that over 1M people (11.3%) were confirmed previously infected.
5694,Probably a lot higher in Texas though!
5695,Ha.
5696,Idk I don’t live there....
5697,Your expectations are unrealistic.
5698,"It’s a virus, it doesn’t care about human schedules."
5699,A tenth of two per day.
5700,There is no chance whatsoever that less than 5 people are going to die in the extra month of the pandemic.
5701,Even just lengthening the current phase of the pandemic by a week results in more than 5 deaths.
5702,No idea why you’re downvoted.
5703,Fuck people who would kill others with their willful ignorance
5704,Do you mean for vaccines or medications?
5705,Because they are totally different ballgames.
5706,Pediatric medication dosing can be very complex.
5707,Unless it’s a medication I prescribe very frequently I look it up and check myself every time.
5708,"For medications, you will see an age range followed by a weight dosing."
5709,Cefriaxone is a good example.
5710,Neonates have weight dosing from 25-100mg/kg/day and then that is further delineated based on day of life (post-natal age).
5711,Kids 6 weeks and up end up being 50-100mg/kg/day.
5712,"Even now while reading up to post this, I realized the gonorrhea dosing changed in 2020."
5713,"As far as vaccines go, totally naive children *usually* require more vaccine boosters for immunity (4 tetanus vaccines by 15mo, for example, while adults only get one every 10 years)."
5714,"Yet for HPV vaccine, the younger you are, the fewer boosters needed."
5715,All you are looking for is the minimum amount needed to stimulate a good immune response.
5716,You won’t get sick by opening your window.
5717,Try to put that thought loop out of your head.
5718,"Outdoor transmission is rare, and exposure time matters."
5719,"For outdoor transmission to occur, think of two singers on a amphitheater stage sharing a microphone as they sing a duet."
5720,Something that close that may result in droplet transmission.
5721,My guy I'm going to be straight up with you and tell you that no one will care.
5722,I am going to sound like one of those deniers at this time last year but people are not going to live their lives in fear after being vaccinated because there's still the possibility they could get infected.
5723,"The rate of infection of people who have been vaccinated is very small, and even smaller still is the amount of people who get seriously ill."
5724,There is extremely little danger in interacting with other vaccinated people inside.
5725,The ridiculousness is on both sides with the virus.
5726,Those who act like nothing is going on and those that act like little is helping.
5727,The logic being the second part of your comment actually feeds into anti-vaxxer rhetoric.
5728,Why should I get a vaccine if I can't even go hang out with my friend?
5729,"The truth of the matter is that vaccines are extremely effective in not just preventing you from getting the virus or spreading the virus, but it also massively reduces the effectiveness of the virus in your body."
5730,People who might have otherwise died are getting colds now.
5731,Are we going to justify shutdowns for people with the vaccine over a cold?
5732,We need to be realistic and honest with people in the risk levels so people can make decisions.
5733,Can you still get sick with the vaccines?
5734,Yes.
5735,Can you still be hospitalized?
5736,Yes.
5737,Can you still spread it?
5738,Yes.
5739,But how *likely* is it?
5740,*How* sick am I going to get?
5741,At what point can we justify not allowing people who are fully vaccinated the ability to congregate?
5742,"For me, personally, as a young, healthy, vaccinated person who lives in a home with other vaccinated people and hangs out with people who have been vaccinated since early March, I fear getting and spreading the virus very little."
5743,"I think we need to be realistic and say to people ""hey, if you're vaccinated, go ahead and hang out with other people who are vaccinated."
5744,"But please stay away from those who aren't."""
5745,I don't really have any idea.
5746,I guess that either try to do it where cases are high or otherwise the controversial type of study where you later get exposed to the virus itself
5747,"You clearly don't understand, because you continue to insist that I'm advocating restrictions be lifted before it's safe to do so."
5748,"If we need mask mandates on public transportation for another four months, so be it."
5749,But telling people it will be another four months when things are changing so rapidly and *no one actually knows how long they'll be needed* isn't going to help anyone.
5750,You want more people vaccinated?
5751,"Supporting blanket, long extensions like this is shooting yourself in the foot."
5752,"Unfortunately, never."
5753,&gt; This is false equivalence?
5754,There has been a flu vaccine available for kids.
5755,But isn't the flu vaccine notoriously *not* effective because it's a guess as to which variants will be floating around each year?
5756,And influenza mutates at a higher rate?
5757,Wtf?
5758,Lol.
5759,I’m vaccinated.
5760,I’m just saying that eventually the unvaccinated will get covid and so it will probably work itself out.
5761,I want ppl to get vaccinated too but science is science regardless of politics.
5762,Pour one out for 12-15 yo with anti vax parents.
5763,How is public perception been without wearing a mask?
5764,"I'm in ny ny and most people on the streets have masks on, plus everywhere indoors requires one."
5765,"Also curious about approaching new ppl, do you mention you're vaccinated and ask the same of them?"
5766,"I'm getting my second Wednesday, very excited to get back to some normalcy"
5767,I am 25 with no health conditions and do not have a job that bumps me up the queue yet I have my first shot next week.
5768,Everyone who wants a vaccine will get one long before September
5769,Thank you for this.
5770,"I don't know why people are downvoting my original comment, it's hard being mentally ill."
5771,It's so hard to rationalize my thoughts sometimes.
5772,"I think what's important to remember is that even if I smelled their smoke, they were over 10 ft away and that would have had to travel quite a distance to get to me and from what I understand (could be wrong) the amount needed to smell smoke is a small fraction of how covid is transmitted."
5773,"And realistically speaking, that also means that I would put myself at risk any time my neighbors were on their balcony talking, something that I oddly enough didn't get paranoid about before."
5774,I mean the pandemic isn’t over and we still have uncertainty regarding the variants.
5775,People write like we’re post-COVID.
5776,[removed]
5777, *400lb 12 year olds.
5778,"* 

It's so disgusting parents will allow their kids to get that way."
5779,Obviously I am not trying to demonize any parent just cause their kid got fat.
5780,But 400lbs is inexcusable.
5781,So I'm in Denver and while it's strict here it probably isn't as locked down as NY.
5782,I wasn't aware there was an outdoor mask mandate here until they repealed it.
5783,Everything I had read said outdoor transmission is low.
5784,No one ever said anything this whole time and I didn't notice any dirty looks so idk.
5785,I went to Florida where I'd say 95% of people didn't wear masks anywhere.
5786,A week there and it suddenly feels normal again not to wear them.
5787,Being back here I just try to read the room.
5788,"If others are wearing masks I will, but if I see some without em I don't put it on."
5789,"If I'm asked to by someone at a business I'll immediately comply, not a big deal, they're just doing their job."
5790,"As for meeting new people being vaccinated eventually comes up, but not like the first question and no one ever seems too worried about it."
5791,"Social distancing rules make it complicated, but if the right opportunity comes up they can make it a blessing in disguise."
5792,Just invite somebody you meet in line for a drink or whatever over to your table.
5793,Congrats on getting your shot!
5794,Enjoy getting back to normal!
5795,"After my first night out post-vaccination, it feels even more surreal to see people on Twitter who say ""I'm fully vaccinated but will continue to wear a mask outside until newborns can get vaccinated""."
5796,"It seems that social media gets more and more divorced from reality by the day, since the bars that I went to were packed, especially past 10 PM."
5797,it is a public holiday kind of  thing.
5798,"most (but not all) places of work close as do schools, usually on a Friday or Monday so people get a longer weekend."
5799,There are 8 of them in the UK which is actually on the low side for a European country.
5800,[removed]
5801,I think that’s a misinterpretation.
5802,The piece is the spike protein itself.
5803,The reason why the vaccines are safe is because the quantity and location of those expressions.
5804,Would that be anything to do with India suddenly needing to keep all the vaccines it is producing?
5805,But what does that matter if you are?
5806,And so are all your customers who wanted one?
5807,"Well, without counting exact proportions or anything, isn't that somehow in line with how well the manufacturers have been delivering on average compared to prior expectations?"
5808,At least for countries who were more reliant on AZ
5809,The la teachers union is massively corrupt and an absolutely horrible organization.
5810,"Funny, I didn't hit 100lbs till I was 18"
5811,Not that I’ve seen.
5812,No there's some remote villages.

5817,"if one is anxious about going back into society, it probably won't be the first thing they do after getting the second dose"
5818,One of the biggest civil injustices in recent memory and the people commiting it would tell you they are the most committed to social justice.
5819,Totally horrible
5820,"Yeah I’ve never been worried about transmission that way, it was annoying when people in my area started wearing them outside and giving you death stares / yells if you didn’t, in addition to scurrying away from you across the street even if everyone (including you)  were masked :/"
5821,[removed]
5822,Why are the vaccines ageist?
5823,Can you cite concrete evidence to prove the opposite?
5824,I literally didn't feel anything when I got my pfizer vaccine.
5825,[removed]
5826,A lot of young adults will be getting their second vaccine dose all throughout May.
5827,Stats and trends have shown more people fully vaccinated= cases go down.
5828,"Gotta admit, I‘m somewhat in the same boat and I don’t see the issue."
5829,"Yes, I‘ll get the covid vaccine and will take medications when my doctor prescribes them."
5830,But simply popping a pill for every little headache or runny nose?
5831,I don‘t think that’s particularly healthy.
5832,"It's worth it usually, maybe some can use this data against social media in the future."

5834,"There is a big difference, as far as the FDA is concerned, between a drug being AUTHORIZED and APPROVED."
5835,Businesses can be fully open and people can/should still wear masks when gathering in large groups.
5836,It's not that big of a deal.
5837,There's no controversy and anyone who says otherwise is deliberately trying to stir it from nothing.
5838,"Just because CDC guidelines say that masks don't need to be worn outside, it doesn't mean that people can't wear masks outside if they choose to."
5839,Not 100% sure honestly.
5840,"This is what the briefing said:

“Data from this weekend from several pharmacies (Walgreens, Albertsons, CVS) is not yet available so the doses administered yesterday are likely to be low."
5841,"The missing doses from this weekend will be reflected in numbers in the next couple days.”

If this is nationwide, that may be what’s causing such a disparity in doses."
5842,"I don’t see why you’re getting downvoted, I’d enjoy a party far more if it was maskless."

5855,"Also, there seems to be an awful lot of anecdotes about major effects to menstruation, which is the last thing my 12 and 16 year old daughters need."
5856,Every single kid we know who got Covid was either asymptomatic or had mild cold symptoms for a day.
5857,My children have zero health issues.
5858,Covid would not be an issue for them.

5884,"""Safety being established"" and ""shown to be safe"" are not the same thing."

5896,This is now endemic.

5925,[removed]
5926,That's great!
5927,What do you think that means?
5928,That’s reassuring that it’s so vigorous.
5929,No vaccines have had any side effects that showed more than a few months after the shot.
5930,"And by now, it’s been way longer than two months for the trial participants."
5931,"How is “not opening up the IP” a “disaster”, when all the factories capable of producing vaccines have IP already?"
5932,We see here \[1\] the CDC says 8 per 100K were hospitalized for Covid-19.
5933,"I suspect this is a low number because this was published in August before some of the newer strains, but we'll run with it."
5934,We see here \[2\] that the flu vaccine reduces hospitalizations in kids by 40%-60%.
5935,"To your point, it explicitly mentions that this is in spite of the vaccine not matching up well against the mutated variants."
5936,"Here \[3\] we see pediatric flu vaccination rates are \~60%

Here \[4\] we see flu hospitalization rates are 17.3 per 100K for kids 5-17

So if we assume that all 17.3 per 100K are non-vaccinated, AT BEST the 60% flu vaccine reduction gets us to like, 7 out of 100K flu hospitalization rate, which is in line with 8 per 100K for (obviously non-vaccinated) kids above

So at this point I would be willing to concede my argument above, except that this analysis so far assumes every kid's infection risk is equal for Covid and Flu."
5937,"Here \[5\] the CDC estimates let's call it 56 million flu cases for the 2019-2020 season, which was pretty bad."
5938,"For a roughly 1-year period, the CDC estimates \[6\] 114M cases of Covid."
5939,"So factoring increased transmission, a kid was at roughly twice the hospitalization risk for Covid as the flu?"
5940,"But with how many vaccinated Americans we have now and how many people have already had Covid, we're not going to see that many cases again over the next year."

5946,"** So yes, I did keep an eye on our county's flu rates during that season, and there were some weeks I went shopping by myself and left my kid with my partner because the numbers were so bad."

5992,That's exactly what it is.
5993,This year has made me absolutely despise the media.
5994,I haven’t seen this directly addressed in anything I’ve read: are younger patients being admitted more because they are getting a more severe form of disease or just because there is now more room and resources in hospitals now that seniors are largely vaccinated?
5995,I wonder how many of these younger patients would’ve been sent home last spring or this past winter.
5996,Because vaccines don't protect 1 in 20 people (95% efficiency).

6040,"So, we can shutdown the country completely (we're already headed on that path)."
6041,"That said, your comment is true in spirit."
6042,Our healthcare system is shit.
6043,We are poor as fuck.
6044,"And unlike India, we  probably aren't going to get much attention from the international community at large."
6045,I’m white and I traveled 20 miles to Detroit for both my shots because that’s where all the available slots were.
6046,When I got inside almost all the nurses had empty stations.
6047,"Unknown to me, my son went with his fiancé to the Ford Field (The brand new football stadium in downtown Detroit paid by the rest of the state through taxes) and it also had so many available nurses he snagged him and gave them a shot even though he had an appointment or 10 days later."
6048,"Funny, because he would think Detroiters would want to set an example about how responsible they are and prove “everybody else wrong“."
6049,I mean when I travel to a foreign country I try to be on my best behavior to not reinforce unfair media hyped stereotypes.
6050,"If I remember correctly reading about that issue, it is often more difficult for a black or Hispanic to get vaccinated because of location, low paying job, absence of proper public transportation or car."
6051,That may not account for everything but it is part of the data that should be in this “fact sheet”.
6052,Idk if anyone has seen the NYT article about how we’ll never reach herd immunity but once again the media is like 3 months behind what people on this sub have been saying forever now
6053,"The COVID data are a little old there, there have been 132 breakthrough deaths as of 4/26, and at the time there were 95 million fully-vaccinated individuals, so it's more like 1 in 720,000."
6054,"If you remove the 20 people that died with COVID but not of COVID, it's more like 1 in 850,000."
6055,"Source: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/health-departments/breakthrough-cases.html

Still, thus far, it's less likely than getting struck by lightning in a given year."
6056,"Let's see, I rather be cautious and think that September is more likely to have the 18-30 crowd vaccinated"
6057,"It’s distressing but not surprising to learn of how much the situation could have been alleviated if the US had actually partnered with countries to make the vaccines since the fall, or hell, just even didn’t block the raw supplies."
6058,Both things essentially not reported on in this sub or any mainstream media outlets.
6059,YES!
6060,THANK YOU!
6061,I think the new strategy should be large indoor anti-vaxxer parties in poorly ventilated buildings.
6062,We have vaccine passports so a lot are eager for vaccines.
6063,"But vaccine passports also cover tests, and previous infection."
6064,"Many people have it in their schedules to get tested once a week, so it’s not the biggest hassle anymore."
6065,"I’m personally okay with the decision, I have really bad health anxiety and get headaches often enough that any headache I’d get after AZ or J&amp;J would send me into an incredible panic attack."
6066,I’m happy that this fear of mine can be mitigated.
6067,I’m also happy that the dropped vaccines can be taken voluntarily.
6068,"Hey, if enough people take them, maybe I can be offered my mRNA vaccine just a little bit sooner."
6069,Even after antibodies are gone subsequent infection is weaker because of our immune systems memory.
6070,We probably won't need boosters that often if hospitals aren't getting overwhelmed.
6071,[removed]
6072,"Of course, I was just wondering if this was mitigated by a higher cost of living in the US."
6073,"But also why then did you originally express surprise that doctors would accept a salary of just 100k after 20 years when that provides them a very comfortable life anyway, without as much excess as those in the US can have?"
6074,The Bangladeshi factory doesn’t just need patents to be waived.
6075,They need technical data packages.
6076,That’s not at all the same thing.
6077,They’d still need a contract of some kind with the IP owners to get the actual step by step and nstructions.
6078,People keep comparing this to the AIDS crisis.
6079,There the Indian firms reverse engineered the medicine and tried to bring it to market.
6080,That was a patent fight.
6081,“Hey I’ve got some machines show me how to use them” is not in the same ballpark.

6120,By mid-July I dear to say vaccine hesitancy is our largest threat.

6124,Better to push this to next year and save all of the investment for a bigger event then.
6125,This is nothing like cancelling a concert in the US.
6126,Yes it’s part of the reason these people in India haven’t been able to get home sooner.

6128,"Although Australia managed to have tennis players from all over the world come in and quarantine, so probably they can expand their current system."
6129,I am confused what you would need so much money for?
6130,100k a year would get you a very nice house in a very nice area  anywhere but London.
6131,500k?
6132,"No difference to 100k outside of London, just with an insane amount of disposable income."
6133,In London it would also be way more than enough for a very nice house in a very nice area with plenty of disposable income.

6151,"Cambodia registered a whopping 841 new COVID-19 cases, by far the highest single-day finding, causing the Kingdom’s total confirmed cases to jump to 15,361."
6152,"The new cases were found in the following cities and provinces:
– Phnom Penh: 525 cases
– Banteay Meanchey: 153 cases
– Sihanoukville: 62 cases
– Kandal: 33 cases
– Kampong Cham: 21 cases
– Kampong Thom: 15 cases
– Siem Reap: 7 cases

The Ministry of Health also reported 61 recoveries today, which raises the country’s total recoveries to 5,430 – or only about a third of total cases."
6153,"The death toll, meanwhile, increased as well today to 106, with 4 deaths confirmed this morning."
6154,"The deaths are believed to occurred in Phnom Penh, as well as a death in Kampong Chnnang where the deceased’s children had also contracted the virus after taking a three wheeler from Phnom Penh to Kampong Chnnang – as the deceased allegedly could not afford a Covid-19 test in a private hospital in Phnom Penh."
6155,Full details of the fatalities have not ye been released by the Ministry.
6156,A Covid-19 positive woman walks to a waiting ambulance as health officials look on.
6157,"Last night, the Prime Minister had announced that there was no reason to extend the lockdown in Phnom Penh and Kandal except some parts which are high risk areas."
6158,The lockdown is supposed to end on May 5.
6159,"However that may be in doubt, until Phnom Penh’s capital administration provides full details as to where the 525 positive cases were located and how many were from outside the Red Zones."
6160,is this the same vaccine or a different version of the ones Adults have gotten?
6161,As a Floridian I have no problem with this.
6162,My wife is a healthy 34 year old and had no issues getting her first and second vax.
6163,My in laws in their 60/70s have been fully vaccinated for months.
6164,At this point we need to start trusting that the vaccines work and are our path to returning to normalcy.
6165,With that being said he specifically mentions private businesses are free to do whatever they want.
6166,And I’d imagine most businesses in larger cities will continue to practice social distancing and mask wearing for a least another couple of months.

6244,"Remember though, the reason that younger people tend to have more side effects is because their immune systems are stronger."
6245,These side effects (while brutal - I got it and I’m 22) are just a sign that their bodies are hard at work producing antibodies.
6246,"Also, the Pfizer vaccine is already a significantly lower dose than the Moderna (so we already know that having “too much” isn’t going to cause significantly higher side effects, since Moderna side effects are somewhat but not hugely more common than Pfizers)"

6326,My headache lasted about 3 days.
6327,I do know others that had fatigue and body aches for almost a week.
6328,"It varies for all, but if you do get concerned, you should talk to your doctor."
6329,"Right, I don't think having a lull in vaccinations right now is the complete end of the world, but if it doesn't pick back up by say August, ahead of the Fall season, that could spell trouble"
6330,Miracles had nothing to do with it.
6331,I had an interesting experience in regards to people's attitudes about post-vaccine life.
6332,"I recently had two fully vaccinated people stop by my house unannounced (one to drop off an envelope, the other was biking by)."
6333,"They are both in their 60s, live in the same town, and are politically liberal."
6334,"The guy biking comes up to me, hugs me, no mask and wants to see what work I've done in the house."
6335,"He says ""I'm fully vaxxed so we're good""."
6336,So I show him around inside.
6337,"The woman comes up to my porch, masked and keeping a good distance while she hands off the envelope and we catch up from a distance."
6338,"Vaccines come up and she reveals she's ""fully vaxxed"" but still is not going out and only sees other people masked if at all."
6339,"I asked if she thought the vaccines worked or not then, and she just gave a roundabout answer about variants and ""still being able to get covid""."
6340,"As of Saturday I'm 2 weeks past by 2nd dose, so I'm feeling more like the older guy (""I'm good"" now)."
6341,"Yet, I worried like I'm going to get chewed out by people that are still fearful even after vaccination."
6342,Its going to be a strange period going forward in terms of how people respond.
6343,Anyone who doubts the potential danger posed by this virus should take a look at the r/covidlonghaulers sub.
6344,"There are people there enduring unimaginable suffering, and their stories are what kept me vigilant these past 14 months."
6345,Looking forward to actually being in the same room with a few people outside my house soon now that my second Moderna shot is out of the way.

6350,Will have to wait for them to be allowed to do it while I’m knocked out then
6351,I think the thing is those generic treatments would have to be tested and approved is that not correct?
6352,While this would expected to go from factories into arms asap right?
6353,Please let me know if I'm completely wrong here.
6354,Accept you can still transmit the virus even if vaccinated.
6355,Is it safe to say herd immunity has been achieved?

Taiwan became the latest place to ban arrivals from coronavirus-stricken India on Monday, as it moves to prevent new infections, with more nations reporting cases of a variant first identified in the subcontinent."
6369,"The variant, B.1.617, has reached at least 17 countries, from Britain and Iran to Switzerland, sparking global concern and spurring several to close their borders to people travelling from India."

6418,you know nothing of regional geopolitics
6419,&gt;The stories about how slow Europe/Canada was at vaccination turned out to be just as short-lived as the ones about how slow the US was at vaccination.
6420,"Except we both started at roughly the same time and, at least in Germany, we just didn't vaccinate anyone between January and like two weeks ago."
6421,I still have no clue when I'll be able to get vaccinated whereas my entire family in the US is currently fully vaccinated.
6422,"Everything here is closed, we can't be out of our houses at night, and my university is talking about having *another* online semester even though said semester doesn't start until October."

6449,"Taipei, May 3 (CNA) Taiwan on Monday confirmed two new domestic cases of COVID-19, bringing the number of cases linked to Taiwan's China Airlines (CAL) and an airport hotel in Taoyuan to 26, according to the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC)."
6450,"One of the two cases was a Taiwanese man in his 40s who was working on a renovation project as a subcontractor at the Novotel Taipei Taoyuan International Airport hotel, which has emerged as the source of a COVID-19 cluster over the past week."
6451,The man developed a cough on April 28 and visited a medical clinic on April 30.
6452,"He was arranged to be tested for COVID-19 the next day, according to Health and Welfare Minister Chen Shih-chung (陳時中), who heads the CECC."
6453,"When asked why the man was not immediately quarantined when the first case in the hotel cluster was confirmed on April 29, Chen said it was because the man did not have much contact with other hotel employees, and no guests were staying on the floors he was working on."
6454,"Some subcontractors were asked to quarantine while others were only asked to monitor any symptoms they might develop, Chen said, but that approach has now changed, with all of the subcontractors asked to isolate themselves."
6455,The CECC is still looking into where the man went prior to testing positive and does not know how he became infected.
6456,"Chen said the CECC has some ideas, but will not offer an explanation until it gets more clarity on the situation."
6457,"The second domestic COVID-19 case confirmed Monday, an Indonesian national in her teens, is a family member of a CAL cargo pilot who tested positive for the disease in Australia on April 20."
6458,Two other family members of his have also tested positive since.
6459,"As of Monday, 10 CAL cargo pilots, eight relatives of CAL cargo pilots, five people who worked at Novotel and three of their family members have tested positive for COVID-19 over the past two weeks, according to the CECC."
6460,"The cases of the Novotel employees, their family members, and the pilots' relatives have been classified as domestic cases, but the CECC has not yet classified the pilots' infections."
6461,"Because some of the CAL pilots stayed at the Novotel before testing positive, and the genome sequencing of the virus in the pilots and a hotel employee matched, there is a possibility that the cases are connected, though the chain of infection is unclear, the CECC said."
6462,"The Novotel airport hotel is part of CAL's complex in Taoyuan, which comprises the Taiwanese carrier's headquarters and training facilities."
6463,"The hotel is also used to quarantine flight crews of CAL and other airlines, and as a venue for accommodation, conferences and dining by the general public."
6464,"The six imported cases reported Monday, meanwhile, came from the Netherlands, Indonesia and Uzbekistan."
6465,"Five involve foreign nationals who came to work as crew members on ships or fishermen, and one a Taiwanese national who returned from a business trip."
6466,"To date, Taiwan has recorded 1,145 cases of COVID-19, 1,003 of which have been classified as imported."
6467,"Of the total, 1,058 have recovered, 12 have died, and 75 are in the hospital, according to CECC statistics as of Monday."
6468,"Globally, COVID-19 has infected over 152.3 million people in 193 countries and regions, with more than 3.2 million fatalities, CECC figures show."

6509,Yes!
6510,Our excess death count is just the difference in how many people who died this year compared to in a typical year.
6511,That's probably accurate.
6512,Pretty much everybody who dies in the United States will have that death recorded and counted.
6513,The number of people we have counted who died of covid is a bit lower so either A.
6514,We missed some covid deaths or B.
6515,There was another cause of extra deaths.
6516,A seems more likely to me.
6517,I feel this so much.

6521,Right that's kind of what spurred my question if they were doing 2 doses or were they testing a 1 dose.
6522,I'm just curious and just couldn't find any data on it.
6523,My guess is 2 does like someone else suggested to my earlier comment.
6524,Agree.
6525,Would take it or J&amp;J in a heartbeat if possible.
6526,"It's pretty fucking weird and backwards that we're only vaccinating the high risk, only to then let those high risk take more risks while the low risk are asked to avoid risk."
6527,No idea what that musical has to do with it though.

6533,We're really hopeful.
6534,Oh hey it’s me!
6535,I’m not going to go to any indoor restaurants/gyms/events until we reach herd immunity.
6536,I’m worried about variants (present or future) that the vaccine might not be effective against.
6537,I just got my second shot yesterday and once it’s fully effective my husband and I are flying to a different state to see our families.
6538,I’m worried about the plane but I’m going to double-mask it.
6539,I know I’m probably being overly cautious but the past year has been a shit show and I don’t want to prematurely declare victory.
6540,I totally understand why people are going back to their normal lives but I’m just gonna wait a little longer.

6551,"Both Moderna and Pfizer are doing trials right now for kids as young as 6 months, with results expected in the second half of 2021."
6552,"Assuming no safety concerns arise, I've heard it could be available to all kids over 6 months by end of 2021 or early 2022."
6553,Hopefully that was a pessimistic estimate though!
6554,Love to see it approved for everyone before the school year starts.

6556,It was not a lie and I quoted one of the premier vaccine scientists who directly reviewed these vaccines who said EUA vs full approval in this case has nothing to do with safety.
6557,Lots of us in Iowa got vaccinated.
6558,We're not all backwards.
6559,Almost half of us trust science.
6560,😂
6561,I tried but they want me to sign up.
6562,This will have to do.
6563,The people who take it seriously are shifting from those who have been social distancing/wearing masks to those who are fully vaccinated (or plan to be when it’s available to them) and some people don’t like that.
6564,They will make them optional as soon as they start losing business.
6565,Its already happening in states with no mask mandates.
6566,"If people have a choice between going to a store that has a mask requirement, versus going to one without one, many are going to the latter."
6567,"While I was in texas for work for a few weeks, I saw a lot of businesses realize this trend, and change their signs from 'masks required' to 'masks recommended' just to regain customers."
6568,"Mask mandate or not, the people will determine when this ends."
6569,"They can put whatever mandate they want on paper, once people stop obeying, whats the point?"
6570,[removed]
6571,"Because the vaccines are only 95% effective, and because the virus is surging in other countries giving rise to the possibility of variants that are resistant to the vaccine."
6572,The fact of the matter is we aren't going to reach herd immunity on this one.
6573,There are enough anti-vaxxers and people hesitant on the mRNA vaccines that we just... aren't going to get it.
6574,So I'm going to keep wearing masks.
6575,"When I say I would like people to keep wearing masks, I'm not saying that I want to mandate people have to keep wearing masks."
6576,"I just hope that it becomes acceptably normal for people who want to wear masks to do so, such as when they have minor illnesses like sinus infections or during flu season."
6577,"I do think we're lifting mask mandates too soon in the US, but that doesn't seem to be reversing the trend of hospitalizations going down so it seems to not be causing problems."
6578,It still kinda feels like we're in a different country.
6579,"After the CDC announcement last week there was so much ""lol who was wearing masks OUTSIDE?"""
6580,"on here and it's like, come to Philly, we've been wearing them every second outside of the house this whole time and it seems like that's never going to stop because more than half the city doesn't want to get vaccinated..."

6667,The fact that you won't die from COVID or develop a serious illness?
6668,Indoor dining isn't a good idea until cases drop because we are trying to prevent the spread of the disease.

6678,Others have said they feel it right when the vaccine side effects set in.
6679,"But objectively after vaccination your risk is lower than from flu, which also causes such side effects at much lower levels."
6680,"Of course,  now I realize that I'm sure I'll start getting flu vaccines now."
6681,I don't care.
6682,It's about life or death.
6683,I'm about saving the lives of vulnerable people like cancer patients.
6684,The SC can kiss my butt.
6685,But those blood clots appear relatively soon after vaccination.
6686,So this is in-line with what the above poster is saying.

6761,&gt; Vaccinet skulle levereras till Sverige i större mängder i maj. Eftersom vaccinet ändå inte rekommenderas till personer under 65 år beslutar Folkhälsomyndigheten att för närvarande rekommendera fortsatt paus för användning av Janssens vaccin i Sverige för alla åldersgrupper.
6762,"The vaccine is restricted to 65+ due to blood clots, and then suspended altogether because we are pretty much finished with that age group already."
6763,"The primary reason Janssen is not used is because of the heavy restriction put on it due to the blood clot issues, not logistical issues."

6932,Here there's a mix of everything IMO.
6933,I hate to hear that.
6934,"I do hope that Oktoberfest 22 is off the chain, and simply the best ever."

6942,I mean I hate fucking needles!
6943,but the needle is so small you wont even really notice it.
6944,seeing as you're already getting downvoted it seems it's too hard to figure out.
6945,"i thought after a year of this shit, something like that should not be a matter of discussion but hey people never fail to surprise me"
6946,This is a good point.
6947,"I definitely do not miss doing stuff with my coworkers that I felt like I had to for my career, and messing with random family that you don’t care about."
6948,"I am more talking about actual social events that you want to do, like going out with your friends or family that you do like"
6949,Your dreaming
6950,That's not what they meant.
6951,Driving your car is dangerous because you might crash.
6952,Everybody takes that risk.
6953,They think that risk is comparable to getting COVID in a restaurant after being fully vaccinated.
6954,I would eat indoors in a restaurant during flu season without any precautions.
6955,Why shouldn't I eat indoors now if I'm fully vaccinated?
6956,&gt; that’s as close as you get.
6957,Well no it is not.
6958,You are more protected when the spread of the virus is lower.
6959,The reality is doctors are being replaced more and more with cheaper and lower educated providers.
6960,"However, the costs to patients are not decreasing as those corporations and businesses which run hospitals and healthcare groups simply increase their profits."
6961,"Only if travelers use our vaccines, because their vaccines are bad."

6966,Or better yet.
6967,Let people make their own choices especially if the vaccine is available to everyone.
6968,Covid will burn itself out to be on the level of flu infections and those that are vulnerable will deal with it as they always have.
6969,Much has been learned on how to treat it too.
6970,So why not let people live again as they always have.
6971,"that's ok, cheers!"
6972,"&gt;Reading the responses, it seems like this sub is increasingly populated by people who have covid anxiety

It's funny, I actually have the opposite feeling."
6973,"Relative to Twitter or place like the NYT comment section, this sub feels like a breath of fresh air of people who feel that we'll be able to return to some sense of normalcy soon enough."
6974,"And while Twitter isn't real life, even amongst my friends, there's a sense that we won't get back to ""normal"" soon."
6975,"I live on a college campus, and basically everyone here believes we'll have to wear masks indoors and in classes for the next year (despite the fact my school has mandated vaccines, so the community risk of COVID is going to be astronomically small)."
6976,"Personally, I feel like I've done my part for the past year and a half."
6977,"I'm vaccinated, thank goodness."
6978,I'm ready to reclaim a sense of normal
6979,Well done!

6989,"The evidence is accumulating that shows vaccinated people are not a meaningful public health threat, especially those who have received the mRNA vaccines."
6990,"And yes, while their power is somewhat reduced the vaccines we have still hold up remarkably well against all *known* variants."
6991,People who are neither vulnerable or represent a public health threat should not be treated as if they are.
6992,The fact is all of the vaccines out there drastically reduce both your own vulnerability *and* the level of threat you pose to others.
6993,"I’ll never change your mind, but I think to dispute this is and continue to believe it will never get better is a fantasy world almost as far gone as the one claiming COVID is not real."
6994,"the longer people stayed inside, the longer they were conditioned to think this is right the longer it is going to take for them to come out of a shell."
6995,They have spent every day on the internet and it's sad but it happens.
6996,I even got nervous seeing the texas rangers game a month or so ago.

6998,"I haven't gotten my vaccine yet, but I'm still on track to get my first shot before summer officially."
6999,It hasn't pushed anybody longer than 4 weeks.
7000,That said - it's heavily speculated the dropped vaccines will be able to be taken voluntarily soon privately &amp; if J&amp;J is an option I'm taking it.
7001,"I'm not in a risk group with that vaccine, so why not get it over with?"
7002,I know this is great news personally for many American families but I see it as bad news for the rest of the world.
7003,"We're going to start vaccinating teenagers when other countries have barely started vaccinating elderly due to lack of supply, and having more eligible Americans means more stockpiling vaccines instead of sending them to where they're desperately needed."
7004,Those partitions don't do anything.
7005,Where is the science?

7010,You can't challenge it.
7011,Legislation passed by Parliament isn't subject to judicial review.
7012,Okay you’re right and the FDA’s vaccine scientist of four decades is wrong.
7013,When he said it doesn’t mean they’re less safe he meant it does mean they’re less safe.
7014,You’re assuming you know exactly what the criteria is to determine safety better than they do.
7015,I do think quite some people felt forced into a lot of social activities precovid that they have just been relieved from.
7016,Beers with my manager a coworkers on Thursdays?
7017,Those annoying distant family members you got guilted into visiting for a drink between Christmas and new years?
7018,"Of course you could always say no before, but always getting guilted about it....."
7019,"Using a J&amp;J next week is not gonna prevent a death today, is it?"
7020,People dying now has been infected 3-4 weeks ago.
7021,That might not ever happen in America.
7022,"In Ohio, we are already seeing huge drops in vaccine uptake and we are not even at half of the population fully vaccinated."
7023,UK is currently suffering due to low supply (very low number of first doses).
7024,When extra doses will be provided it will go up to 600-700k easily.
7025,here we are 3 months later.
7026,looks like weve done it 🤙🏽
7027,Good.
7028,This is GREAT news!
7029,Anti vax doesn't apply to everyone who doesn't want a covid vaccine.
7030,It's a disingenuous take.
7031,Do you happen to know why Moderna decided to go for 100ug?
7032,"I am a week away from being fully vaccinated, and I don't plan on returning to normal yet."
7033,"I will follow what the CDC says is safe, but I don't think I will even go eat at an outdoor restraunt."
7034,I'm not afraid of covid.
7035,"I am afraid of spreading it, but that isn't what is causing my anxiety."
7036,Covid has made me realize how incredibly selfish the vast majority of people are.
7037,Almost every one I know didn't change how they lived their life during the pandemic.
7038,"Most continued going to restraunts, traveling, and going to bars."
7039,Seeing how many people werent willing to make sacrifices in their lives for the good of everyone else ruined my perception of people.
7040,I don't want to be around those people.
7041,Its infuriating to see them live so care free when so many have died.
7042,Thats what's keeping me from returning to normal.
7043,[removed]
7044,Mostly just fever I think.
7045,[removed]
7046,The issue is Biden signed the executive order saying you have to wear masks in federal buildings.
7047,"I agree the look is a bit dumb, but you can't do that and then say ""well, not for me..."""
7048,Sounds like it messed with your brain.
7049,so terrorists?
7050,I've been back 3 weeks now and its sending me insane.
7051,Not sure how much longer I can last.
7052,"That’s sad, it’s really the only thing Canadians have to look forward to"
7053,[deleted]
7054,[deleted]
7055,Masks and restrictions will gradually fade out over time.
7056,There’s never going to come a moment when they just say “and... go!” and everyone takes them off.
7057,People will stop doing it over time as they feel safe to do so.
7058,Low case counts and very low hospitalization rates and virtually no deaths will make people feel that safety.
7059,Just got stabbed by Windows 10 this morning and my graduation ceremony is in 15 days!
7060,Got summer plans to move all the country lmao
7061,"Then that sort of goes against the entire purpose of vaccines, no?"
7062,"If you have 60% of adults vaccinated, then a spike simply isn’t possible."
7063,You act like I am claiming COVID-19 is a leading cause of death among children.
7064,I am not.
7065,I acknowledge it's rarity as a cause of death.
7066,But when you are within an order of magnitude in terms or risk I don't see a need to argue with you about that.
7067,"However, you keep downplaying the virus by continuing to state that it doesn't kill kids."
7068,That is simply not true.
7069,Oddly you also keep acknowledging that it kills kids in your replies by bringing up the number kids killed by swimming pools and moose.
7070,Maybe there is some threshold above which children's deaths start to have significance for you.
7071,But I assure you those COVID-19 deaths had significance for the people who had to bury those children.
7072,You are entitled to your own opinions.
7073,But not your own facts.
7074,The fact is that children have died from COVID-19.
7075,In the US it has killed enough kids to empty a few classrooms.
7076,In Brazil it has killed enough kids to empty a few schools.
7077,And how are countries keeping more of their kids alive irrelevant to anyone who actually cares about kids?
7078,This virus is endemic because it lives in both animals and people.
7079,Viruses that are endemic but only live in people can be controlled and in the case of smallpox eradicated.
7080,This virus lives in animals too so we cannot eradicate it.
7081,But it's not like we are helpless.
7082,I never got to work from home.
7083,So I have been exposed to the virus.
7084,But I also spent much of that time looking at the raw data from countries and their Covid-19 clinical trials.
7085,That is why I spent a year masked up and eating in my car and got vaccinated as soon as it became available.
7086,I had hundreds of temperature checks and the only fever I got for over year was just a sign that the vaccine worked.
7087,Science kept me safe.
7088,Science kept my family safe.
7089,Science could and should be keeping many more families safe.
7090,And I brought up polio because we would already be rid of that endemic but only in people virus if people had not politicized getting vaccinated against it too.
7091,Saying this virus doesn't kill kids won't make it true.
7092,But it could make it less likely for people to do what they should be doing to make this virus less deadly.
7093,"And I don't know if you get that when you are talking about how endemic diseases become less lethal over time you are still talking about ebola, smallpox, measles and malaria."
7094,Which stayed pretty lethal after being around for generations.
7095,"And finally even when it doesn't kill children, or cause major injury, kids getting COVID-19 puts adults at risk."
7096,And no kid wants to grow up knowing they might have unintentionally killed their teacher or grandparent.
7097,And I know you probably just want me to call you names.
7098,"But at the end of the day I really just want someone to make ""To investigate, record and make public the causes of fatal treatment resistance in clinical trials in Canada"" a line in a law."
7099,That's the rational way to save a whole lot of lives in Ontario.
7100,.
7101,Pretty much all of the anti-mask/anti-lockdown/anti-vaccination arguments depend on acting like pandemics are completely new phenomenon and governments haven't been dealing with them for as long as thier have been governments.
7102,"They don't just disagree with the specifics of how we should deal with COVID, they want to pretend that public health isn't even a function of government."
7103,I could get hit by a car tomorrow on my way to work too god willing... Plus I have really yet to see any evidence that the new variants of Covid are any more dangerous outside of hyped up media that preys on people like you for clicks.
7104,And regardless of all this positive data Osterholm is going to say we’re moving into our next surge.
7105,It’s now 2040 and we’re moving into our 50th Covid-19 surge.
7106,[removed]
7107,"No, I wore my mask, I went to work because I couldn't sit at home."
7108,I also was a victim of covid early on.
7109,I knew it was bar news and it sucked
7110,Audio abs Visual Entertainment is something like 3% of the country workforce.
7111,The vast majority of the fashion industry here is immigrant seamstresses.
7112,"Nothing about LA can be explained statistically by Hollywood, modeling or social media."
7113,While those provide high profile media attention.
7114,"They are nothing compared to tech, medical, engineering, trade, food service, manufacturing."
7115,LA is the biggest trade port and the busiest airport.
7116,But you don’t need a college degree for most of that.
7117,"It’s the largest manufacturing base, but again you don’t need a degree for most of that."
7118,Even entertainment industry is mostly crew people and post processing.
7119,LA is just huge.
7120,It has everything.
7121,It graduates the most engineers in the nation.
7122,It’s also the biggest magnet for Central American immigrants with high degree of no high school diploma.
7123,That’s a far more significant stat than “self centered tok tokers who don’t care about education”.
7124,"Got my second dose a week ago, just a bit of pain in my arm for the first few days after but that was it, now to stare at my watch for the next week"
7125,Lockdown made sense 14 months ago.
7126,In an era where we have vaccines I would expect a more nuanced and targeted solution than shutting down the entire country.
7127,"I had Fever, loss of appetite, and a terrible headache all day after Pfizer #2, which did you have?"
7128,Well it also doesn't help that my wifes family is from sicily the poor part of the country.
7129,Beautiful area and tons of great culture but just so far behind in times
7130,Why does it particularly bother you?
7131,"If they wear masks, that doesn’t really effect you any, does it?"
7132,"3-4 more weeks of shutdowns in Portland , should line up to when the wildfires start filling the air with smoke keeping us inside"
7133,[removed]
7134,I think meth addicts are far more reasonable people than anti vaxxers
7135,Actually yes.
7136,All of these people who tout their greatness are all obviously not masking in indoor private gatherings and are probably even going out to eat
7137,Fully vaccinated and just had my College Graduation ceremony today in person with my family in attendance!
7138,Never thought this would be possible a few months ago!
7139,There's light at the end of the tunnel!
7140,This is what I'm doing with my kids.
7141,"They got their first shots 2 weeks ago, and at the time I couldn't find any appointments nearby so had to get them during the school day across town."
7142,"Now, shots are available like everywhere so I'm going to cancel their 2nd appointments at that place and just get it somewhere local and convenient."
7143,Most pharmacies ask you which shot you're looking for and the two shots of each type are identical so easy to switch.
7144,Not excessive at all.
7145,The rate of growth is situational.
7146,"What’s true with some restrictions still in place, in warm weather, will not necessarily be true when it’s a free for all and the weather turns cold."
7147,We don’t know what percentage of a population has to be vaccinated to keep covid at bay in the US with no restrictions in Winter months.
7148,I would be quite surprised if we achieve herd immunity in that situation if we get less than half the population vaccinated (60% of 16+ pop is less than half total pop).
7149,I would not mind if we adopted the mindset of Asian countries like Japan where you wear a mask if you have a cold so you're not spreading germs while you're at work or at school.
7150,But wearing a mask as a prophylactic after the pandemic is over?
7151,"Well, I personally don't think that would be necessary."
7152,But that's just me.
7153,In Brescia of all places too.
7154,"The city that, together with neighboring Bergamo, was the most impacted of all Italy."
7155,[removed]
7156,I used to get sick easily (like really sick for 2 weeks at a time) 3-4 times a year as far as I remembered since middle school.
7157,"Since 2020, I haven't gotten even a cold."
7158,"I think in public, I'll continue to wear a mask."
7159,Not sure exactly how it is calculated.
7160,You can use this website to see it thought different places have different numbers.
7161,https://covidactnow.org/?s=1803721
7162,All the ones available in US offer virtually complete protection against serious complications and death.
7163,"In terms of whether you’re protected from getting it at all, Pfizer and Moderna are over 90% after two shots and the one-shot J&amp;J is a bit lower at around 70%."
7164,"I chose Pfizer, but would have taken any in a heartbeat."
7165,[removed]
7166,"Sure, and good on you for actually offering that kind of job, but I think you are looking at it from the side of the employer and not seeing that you're probably in the minority."
7167,"Most places that are hiring are hiring for those minimum wage jobs, and even if they aren't the pay is lower than it was pre covid because a lot of corporate entities think they can get away with it."
7168,"And at a certain point, yes they are."
7169,"I mean once vaccination has started and everyone has the access, how is it on the rest of us?"
7170,"And I get it, I'm speaking from a place of privilege as well."
7171,"My employer was able to bring us back and forth even though we had a brief second shut down they were still willing to pay our salary, but as someone who works closely with the service industry, employers fall into 2 camps."
7172,"The small business that can't afford to bring people back or pay them full wages because if they do another shutdown ruins them, and larger corporate businesses where the parent company has used covid as an excuse to pay new hires a full 2-3 dollars an hour less usually for part time work."
7173,"The worst I've seen was a regional chain restaurant that is not only paying new employees less and part time, but forces them to ""be on call"" (as in no other job) in case someone scheduled goes out with covid."
7174,"I don't think whether they're symptomatic of not applied yet, since they haven't gotten their second shot."
7175,Lived there for a year and been there multiple times
7176,Honestly unless you're a member of an extremely vulnerable population it doesn't matter at all.
7177,If you are vulnerable ask your doctor
7178,How do you calculate the R0 exactly?
7179,Just curious because I wanna find the R0 for NY
7180,No.
7181,Get the first vaccine available to you.
7182,"If you end up in a situation where you can get any of them without waiting then get whichever, but failing that the J&amp;J vaccine is still incredible."
7183,Spain has a digital certificate on your DNI(that you are supposed to always carry anf clubs must check to see if you are 18).
7184,You can store the public key which is just numbers and verify by tapping and encrypting a random number with the private key inside the DNI.
7185,They have the technology and have been using it for government websites for years
7186,What does continue wearing one mean though.
7187,I doubt they have wearing it 24/7 in question.
7188,I'd certainly consider on public transport in the winter or if I'm sick myself.
7189,Oh.
7190,There's plenty of those working in healthcare right now.
7191,No vaccine passports should be allowed for essential services.
7192,You can’t demand them for grocery stores for example.
7193,People can just mask up in these places.
7194,But all non essential services are fair game.
7195,"And having a smartphone and an ID to cross reference it with is a perfectly reasonable prerequisite, given the vast majority of people will be able to comply."
7196,"You don’t want to disproportionately affect poor people negatively but all your concerns will lead to no vaccine passports which will hurt all demographics, including poor people, most of whom have smartphones and IDs."
7197,Do you want the uneven sharing of blessings or the equal sharing of misery?
7198,That the focus should be on insulin resistance rather than just obesity.
7199,"The worst are the ""I'll keep wearing a mask so people don't think I'm a conservative"" like A) no you won't and B) you absolute child."
7200,Put shots in arm and zero COVID arrives.
7201,It’s that simple.
7202,People avoid the shot?
7203,"Non-pharmaceutical interventions (masks, not full bars, social distancing) continue."
7204,You don’t need everyone to get vaccinated.
7205,"And yes, if we don’t reach herd immunity through vaccination it’s everyone’s problem."
7206,Deal with it.
7207,[removed]
7208,"You’re probably one of the mindless selfish goons who prolonged the pandemic by acting like a toddler that didn’t get his way since March 2020 and yelled and screamed about your “freedoms”, that no one actually took away."
7209,So true!!
7210,!
7211,Yeah I think it's a lot of big talk from a good portion of those people.
7212,Personally I'll take the risk of catching a couple colds every year in exchange for not having to wear a mask every where I go anymore.
7213,[removed]
7214,[deleted]
7215,What risk exactly is there?
7216,"Once you have 60%+ of adults vaccinated, case growth falls apart."
7217,"The word ""terrorist"" has lost its meaning in Turkey."
7218,Interesting I know the measles are still around but you know heard immunity... but won't stop you from our in the sky let's not open anything until zero covid
7219,[removed]
7220,Okay but what if people refuse to get vaccinated?
7221,That’s not my problem then
7222,You think those people go to bars?
7223,Haha so you going to have police there to enforce it?
7224,Y'all lost you're minds its scary.
7225,You probably one of the hermits that never left home and wiped down everything arent you?
7226,Nothing in this life is a guarantee except death.
7227,Once we get to that 60% range we will be fine.
7228,[removed]
7229,"Yeah no, I’m Italian and I don’t know anybody that’s around 40 that lives with parents…don’t get me wrong, there is somebody that do that…but is uncommon…"
7230,Well done.
7231,Hope US let the other countries to get more vaccine from pfizer.
7232,🤞
7233,"So basically because you can't work from home, that means everyone shouldn't as well?"
7234,And it's not like everyone who is pro-restrictions works from home and vice versa.
7235,There's plenty of the opposite.

7251,"All sources say it's safe to take them after, but nothing conclusive (or really anything) about the impact in efficacy based on a potentially dampened response."
7252,It's likely because it's not as conclusively known.

7326,I’ve been going through my city and state’s stats on a near-daily basis.
7327,We’ve hit 55% of adults with at least one shot and the rate of case growth has fallen by more than 70% and this is with restrictions routinely getting lifted.
7328,"At least in the short term, it’s hard to see how we’d start spiking and, more broadly, it’s even remotely tenable to go back to shutting things down."
7329,"Again, my question here comes down to the following: if mass vaccination can’t allow people to meaningfully return to their lives, then what’s even the point?"
7330,How are we supposed to get more people on board if the “exit strategy” doesn’t lead to an exit at all?
7331,My life and career basically fell apart because of all of this and I’m not sure if I could go through it again.
7332,I am a 44 year old American with a 15 year old son.
7333,"Due to the financial hit I have taken from COVID-19, I recently (March 9th), moved in with my 78 year old Mother."

7347,Thanks anti-vaxxers!
7348,Exactly.
7349,Before the vaccines arrived I was super concerned (and angry) at those just going about their lives as if covid isn't real or not a big deal.
7350,Now that we have the vaccines and I'm getting my 2nd shot on Saturday I'm not longer concerned with how others treat the pandemic.
7351,Add that my family and friends are fully vaccinated and my community is well on its way people's recklessness is no longer a public concern in my life.
7352,For those in areas where it's really bad and people are refusing to get vaccinated I can understand still being upset at those people.
7353,Overall California is right in the middle of the pack (slightly better than average) in terms of overall cases per capita since the start of the pandemic.

7356,"For what it's worth, Mississippi's reporting is very inconsistent."
7357,They often go 2+ days without reporting any meaningful administration - including the past 2 days.
7358,Doesn't seem to strongly correlate to weekends so I'm not sure what the deal is.
7359,"Regardless, Mississippi has been languishing since early in the campaign."
7360,There is a reason they were the first state in the Continental US to open it up to 16+ - the demand just isn't there between the strong rural Republican population and Black population.
7361,Both groups are highly vaccine hesitant and it's reflected in the state's demand (as well as the demand of the rest of the Deep South).
7362,"I've long modeled Mississippi as being the winner of the ""lowest end vaccination rate"" despite doing a relatively decent job in the very early days of the campaign in terms of getting shots in arms."
7363,"The logistics were there (kudos to the state), but the arms stopped showing up."
7364,And spread it?
7365,That’s bullshit mate
7366,[removed]
7367,the goal was to reduce the # of cases.
7368,"Jan 20 - we averaged 195k cases, we're now at 50k cases."
7369,that was the point.
7370,It was to show a clear shift from the previous white house admin that masks do work and people should wear them.
7371,"the issue is that in some states and in some communities, that definitely isnt the case, so as everyone expected, thats where future clusters will end up"
7372,Hopefully they can manage to handle it before it outbreaks any further.
7373,"They've done it before, so I'm sure they can manage again."
7374,It's definitely easier now that there's no adult surge and testing is pretty easy to get.
7375,"Wasn't the case for most of the last year though, and still nowhere will test a 2 year old except bringing her to the urgent care associated with our pediatrician's office."
7376,And they still only do antigen tests for some reason and told us if we wanted PCR we'd have to be shipped a kit.
7377,"That was for the last cold - the other 2 times, I didn't even realize my daughter was sick for the first one until I got sick (we were notified another kid in the daycare had cold symptoms), and the second one came in such quick succession I didn't know it was a new illness in her until I got a second cold (I tested negative all times by PCR...I keep a damn spare Pixel kit around at all times now so I don't have to wait for it to ship here)."
7378,I have to infer by her level of grumpiness and maybe I hear some unclear post nasal drip at night.
7379,"But yeah every cold is now a major ""is it COVID?"""
7380,freakout and such a mind f*** with days off work even if we can get out of a 2 week quarantine with a negative test.

7383,"Bay Area is one of the few metro areas that never had a major surge, never had hospitals filled to capacity."
7384,It's one of the biggest Covid-19 success stories in the United States.
7385,Hm are you sure?
7386,I thought we were considering a 100 day federal mandate and then decided against it.
7387,If he asked everyone to wear them for 100 days 101 days ago then I'd consider our obligation to listen to his request over by now.
7388,When was it realized that flattening the curve was a bad idea?
7389,i would not be so quick to cast that moniker on everyone.
7390,"just because its available to all it doesnt mean everyone is fully vaccinated since there is, at minimum, a 2 week post-1st dose period where you dont have the full protection of the vaccine, and for most people, that period is closer to 5 to 6 weeks depending on which one you got."
7391,"obviously, the 1st dose will offer some protection, but that doesnt mean that people cant get infected in the interim between their 1st and 2nd doses

oh and dont forget, about a quarter of the population cant get vaccinated because they are children, and there are quite a few outbreaks in schools right now"
7392,Jesus.

7412,"It could be one of the other New England states, but it will most likely be MA."
7413,"New Hampshire has the highest first doses as of today (ahead of only MA), but candidly their data is a little odd and I'm not sure I trust it (they are either under-reporting second doses or over-reporting first doses)."
7414,"Massachusetts has more ""velocity"" and has shown the most resiliency in first dose administration as the remaining eligible population shrinks."
7415,This shouldn't come as a surprise as MA almost universally tops the charts on public health measures as well as education which is strongly correlated to willingness to vaccinate.

7418,"With our extremely low natural immunity compared to other states, the little 4th wave surge hit Oregon while other states had enough immunity to not increase."
7419,Several Oregon health experts that do most of our analysis say that it should decrease near May 4th.
7420,They showed some math comparing the natural immunities and vaccines where other states achieved when they started to see decreases.
7421,"We might already be there, but I haven't checked positivity rates and tests for this weekend."
7422,"Brown already said they want to open fully by June, but it's mostly based on vaccine %."
7423,"In Portland, there is still high demand so our percentages will keep increasing at least for the short term."
7424,"The indoor dining restriction seems like it won't do much, but I also imagine it will only be for another week or two until the hospitalizations get back to March numbers."
7425,They also increased all outdoor capacity probably due to the CDC guidelines.
7426,"Overall, Oregon has been extremely conservative about the virus."
7427,We are top 3 in lowest cases per capita and 5th in lowest deaths per capita.
7428,"A lot of people on here like to shit on Oregon for the strict rules, but at least they can't argue about the results."

7439,So much for the pea brained morons who want to believe Covid19 is just like the flu and no big deal.
7440,We destroyed flu.
7441,"I will just vent a little that there are still so many idiots who either equate getting the Covid19 vaccine with political belief, and so they won’t get it, or they just don’t trust the vaccine but don’t really know why...and so they won’t get it, and reaching a level of vaccination necessary for herd immunity may not be reached."

7448,"Yeah, and that is still about 50% higher than the peak of the first wave and deaths are still around what they were for much of the time until the 3rd wave."
7449,Definitely a lot of work to be done.
7450,15% of the US population is under 16 and can't get the vaccine at the moment.
7451,That means we need 85% of adults to get full vaccination which is very unlikely to happen.
7452,"Shots for 12 and up are coming, but even with that we won't be at herd immunity."
7453,"Also the 70% is just an estimate, of course, and would differ by infectiousness of the dominant strain."
7454,I don't expect herd immunity in the US in 2021 but hope I'm wrong.

California has higher death totals the past few days."
7541,Could be older deaths that are now being recorded/reported.
7542,So less dangerous than the flu for children?
7543,[removed]
7544,&gt; younger age groups who are now flooding intensive care units everywhere do to variances.
7545,This is not a real thing that is actually happening here in the US.
7546,Bummer
7547,"This is good news

Which other vaccines look like they will be added to the emergency use list soon?"
7548,I mean...you could have been doing that the entire time.
7549,Masks were never necessary outside when you weren't close to people.
7550,"(Before someone accuses me of being an anti-masker, I am absolutely pro-mask and always have been.)"
7551,"Mental health is very real, it sucks the way we treat it."
7552,Wow
7553,Well of course!
7554,Now was a weird time to discover that Target sells L/XL sized masks to cover my giant face.
7555,I bought 4 of them especially because I can foresee indoor masks sticking around a lot longer especially even at events or a “return to the office with masks” kinda being a thing.
7556,Which I’ll take at this point.
7557,And honestly I totally can see myself wearing them on public transit during cold/flu season.
7558,They came out to $2 each so it’s not like I spent that much money on them.
7559,Just put one on and went “holy shit is this how masks should have been fitting for the pst year?”
7560,"It seems like general affluence determines vaccine rates more than political affiliation, though there is already a ton of overlap between those two variables already."
7561,And yet Facebook is still making money.
7562,"well actually, florida is still below average."
7563,"the only ""southern"" state that is at or above the national average is virginia

the cdc says 56.1% of americans over 18 has had at least 1 dose, and most of the south is at or below 50%, with florida and kentucky in the 52% range."
7564,"virginia, the exception, is at 60%

for comparison, new england dominates with about 70% depending on which state you look at"
7565,I think they're already back to normal.
7566,Like everywhere is open and really only masks are used on public transport and in shops.
7567,The first of many.
7568,Facebook
7569,Excellent.
7570,"Keep it going

This nightmare can finally end"
7571,Why would it matter?
7572,A vaccine is essentially training your immune system and then your immune system eliminates it.
7573,"A  year from now, when (and if) a booster is required, your immune system doesn’t remember the previous vaccine."
7574,"If you go to the gym and a trainer works with you this month, do you need to use the same trainer for the rest of your life?"

7577,"Going for our first shot soon, hoping the borders open with HK"
7578,"You will not be surprised to learn that high rent, low salaries and delayed independence due to people pursuing university degrees are also the reason why a lot of people are at home at 35."
7579,"There is a social framework to allow it, but lack of opportunity plays a role too."
7580,"True, but in my opinion that only has a snowball's chance of happening with reconciliation (and even then, there are the complete knobs of Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin whose number one priority seems to be to get everyone to think that government is completely useless), and I don't think you can do that until 2022."
7581,"Until then, it's up to states to get creative."
7582,"Even then, I'm skeptical we're going to see the 7-day average increase from one day to the next ever again."
7583,I think our best hope is for a long right tail that declines at a glacial pace.
7584,"In the meantime, there's nothing stopping us from being proactive."
7585,"Going to businesses where workers can't take time off, getting doses at the community health centers that minority and low-income people trust almost exclusively with their health, etc."
7586,I know right?
7587,"&gt;Yeah, and that is still about 50% higher than the peak of the first wave

I'm kind of amazed if you're an actual epidemiologist and you don't realize that our testing capacity is multiple magnitudes larger than it was in april."
7588,Now maybe they can vaccinate the Palestinians.

7590,"Of course, the 1 country that is hosting the Olympics this year is also doing worse vaccination-wise than Togo, the 14th poorest country in the entire world."

7615,Are these percentage vaccinated numbers based on total population or total eligible population?

7822,The frustrating thing is I cant get enough staff even at that level of pay.
7823,Yes once enough people are vaccinated and cases are back under control then there is no reason why service industry shouldnt be allowed to open.
7824,That being said I'm also in ontario not Montreal.
7825,I'm not sure what the situation is like there but in ontario were still fucked at the moment.
7826,The government has been to quick to lift restrictions and to slow to impose them.
7827,Which goes back to my original comment of picking the scab.
7828,Had we stuck to our strict measures earlier on and waited it out a little longer the service industry wouldn't have had to open and close again and again.
7829,They're getting fucked right now and it's not even funny.
7830,It would have been easier on them to leave them closed a month longer.
7831,Our restrictions have been haphazard at best and not at all based on science.
7832,Things that were very low risk like golfing were closed when other things were kept open that should have closed long ago.

8036,"According to this ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDtKBXOEsoM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDtKBXOEsoM) ), there are two types of ventilators - Negative pressure and Positive pressure."
8037,Negative pressure ventilators were  historically (i.e.
8038,"iron lung) used in 1920s and had many benefits such as being portable and more readily available but only problem was that the patients movement was restricted and the doctor has limited access to the patients body, which caused a shift towards positive pressure ventilators."
8039,These new ventilaros can be both non-invasive and invasive depending on requirements but are generally high-cost so not readily available and require years of training.
8040,Positive pressure ventilators can have cause harm to health in the long term too.
8041,SOLUTION - I would like to propose a solution of using a combination of negative pressure (i.e.
8042,torso only iron lung) and positive pressure (oxygen mask like in airplanes) ventilation.

8081,I'm guessing that 10 to 20 percent of Americans has been infected but not vaccinated yet (either due to choice or ineligibility).
8082,This percentage will increase as age decreases due to the 65+ group having pretty much universally received at least one shot.
8083,"I got my first dose in NY but had to get 2nd dose in another state, is there any way to pass on my fully vaccinated status to the state for statistics purposes?"
8084,"I sorta wonder if I got counted as a fully vaccinated resident of the state I was in as they don't ID you for vaccinations in the state where my second dose was given

In the end I know it doesn't matter; a vaccinated person is a vaccinated person."

8086,So exactly 38 hours ago I had my 2nd shot of Pfizer vaccine.

&gt;It’s hard to know exactly how much more vaccine could be made worldwide if intellectual property restrictions were lifted."
8095,"But Suhaib Siddiqi, former director of chemistry at Moderna, said with the blueprint and technical advice, a modern factory should be able to get vaccine production going in at most three to four months."
8096,"&gt;“In my opinion, the vaccine belongs to the public,” said Siddiqi."
8097,"“Any company which has experience synthesizing molecules should be able to do it.”

&gt;Back in Bangladesh, the Incepta factory tried to get what it needed to make more vaccines in two ways, by offering its production lines to Moderna and by reaching out to a WHO partner."
8098,"Moderna did not respond to requests for comment about the Bangladesh plant, but its CEO, Stéphane Bancel, told European lawmakers the company’s engineers were fully occupied on expanding production in Europe."
8099,"&gt;“Doing more tech transfer right now could actually put the production and the increased output for the months to come at great risk,” he said."

8171,"CVS was responsible for nearly half, and Walgreens was responsible for 21 percent, or nearly 128,500 wasted shots combined."
8172,"&gt;CDC data suggest that the companies have wasted more doses than states, U.S. territories and federal agencies combined."
8173,"Pfizer's vaccine, which in December was the first to be deployed and initially required storage at ultracold temperatures, made up nearly 60 percent of the tossed doses...

&gt;One thing is clear: Months into the vaccination drive, the CDC has a limited view of how much vaccine is going to waste, where it's being wasted and who is wasting it, potentially complicating efforts to direct doses where they are needed most."

8189,"what even was herd immunity, it seemed like a buzz phrase more than actual consensus on any policy back when any widespread vaccine rollout seemed lights year away when spread seemed rampant and inevitable and our lack of coherent response meant we were desperate for the virus to somehow fizzle out."

8217,Yeah this whole patent “situation” honestly seems like a big nothing or distraction or red herring or something.
8218,Moderna isn’t enforcing its patent.
8219,Why aren’t all of the places that want the vaccine patents lifted just making the moderna vaccine now instead of worrying about getting patents lifted?
8220,"If that’s all that’s stopping them, then nothings stopping them."
8221,I doubt that quote is taking B117 or the other variants into consideration.
8222,Does that count for carrying weapons?
8223,That's not accurate.
8224,Immunity isn't solely based on antibody response.
8225,The vaccines and natural immunity probably last a lot longer than you'd think
8226,And the B117 variant is a lot worse for kids than the original strain is.
8227,"Recent research shows that in some countries the risk is much higher, in Norway the chance of dying from AZ vaccine is bigger than dying from the coronavirus for young indivituals."

8260,The rest of the world can't just keep living like this forever.
8261,But I think it will have lost it’s advantage of being a novel virus (like the pre-Covid Coronavirus strains).

8266,"Some perspective: Norovirus kills 50,000 children annually (Spreads much more easily and is more deadly to kids than covid)."

8268,Do you want the oceans to boil?
8269,Germany has just opened it to everyone willing.
8270,Getting into Israel position for coronavirus cases is enough for whole world right now.
8271,"7 day average is nearly 80 cases for Israel, Death is 1-2 which might be better than flue."
8272,"Israel's vaccination ratios for whole population is %58 one dose, %54 full dose."
8273,"United States vaccination ratio is %44 one dose, %31 full dose."
8274,"&amp;#x200B;

When Phizer-Biontech is approved for the population above 6+, the vaccination ratios might be close to %70 for Israel."
8275,So even %58 percent vaccination works and close to eradication.
8276,I believe herd immunity will be reached in Israel and other countries which will get %70 percent vaccination unless new variants appear that effects vaccinated people.

8297,"In the other, in certain regions, thousands die regionally in the winter, and local outbreaks, and while it's now somewhat like the flu, we've got a new, solvable health burden that costs lots of money and human lives."
8298,Getting a vaccine with that excellent an efficacy was a win.
8299,"A win for the people that developed it, and a win for the people that take it."
8300,"Not choosing option two though, is a loss for everyone and constitutes a failed society for me for those places that dont take it."
8301,It underscores a comprehensive failure in education.

8316,"-Its also not the only way to make an immutable database, and some of those other methods are actually faster too."
8317,This is why I haven’t told anyone I know who is unvaccinated about my day after shot 2 side effects.

8324,"I don't have kids, but increasing the eligibility is absolutely necessary since the rate of people getting vaccinated in America is decreasing."

8330,"Everything else I can think of is ""logistical""."
8331,Where do people get the idea that covid will become a common cold.
8332,It is under no pressure to become less deadly due to the long period of presymptomatic spread.
8333,50/822 = 6%
8334,Looks like it'll be approved for 12-15 in the next few weeks.
8335,But we didnt have vaccines back then.
8336,We literally have the technology to make sure no one in the future has to suffer from this disease but you are already giving up on it.
8337,Nice!
8338,This should be a pretty quick incremental ~2.5 to 3.0% to our very solid 44% baseline (12 to 15 is about 5.2% of the total population).
8339,We will almost definitely hit &gt;50% of total population for at least one shot by the end of the month and I think mid-May is in play.

8364,[removed]
8365,[removed]
8366,"I cannot wait for my kids, 8 and 6, to get vaccinated."
8367,"As somebody who is immune compromised, it will give me such peace of mind!"
8368,I remember that the PM say there was no oxygen shortage and to prosecute hospitals claiming otherwise.
8369,Or did I get that wrong?
8370,Hotel quarentine leaks.
8371,I think there have been 16 leaks since November.
8372,[removed]
8373,What a completely and utterly braindead move.
8374,I really hope the rest of Europe won't follow with this lunacy.
8375,I think you have the wrong impression about Russia.
8376,Russian government can't force people to do anything.
8377,"Wear masks, stay at home, get vaccinated, or do anything even remotely like this - [Covid crisis: Australians trying to return home from India face up to $66,000 fine or five years’ jail](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/apr/30/australian-government-may-make-it-a-for-citizens-to-return-from-covid-ravaged-countries)

I can't even begin to imagine anything like that happening in Russia."
8378,"Millions of Russians went to covid hot spots last year, after the pandemic started, and the government brought them back with taxpayers money."
8379,Force measures?
8380,To alienate people who are voting for him?
8381,Like what force measures?
8382,Fines?
8383,How are you gonna fine tens of millions of people.
8384,To not allow them to work unless they get a vaccine?
8385,When there is a lack of workforce as it is.
8386,"The only incentive they can use is to promise money, and they are already starting to do that."
8387,But it is too little too late.
8388,"You need to change people's minds with science, but then people are bombarded with messages like yours ""I am asking myself if Sputnik is %95 works, why there are still many cases and deaths in Russia, even the vaccine is approved 8 months ago."""
8389,It is not if.
8390,It's a great vaccine and it works.
8391,"But there is so much nonsense surrounding it, and people not being scared of COVID at all, so they just don't get vaccinated."
8392,There are still covid cases because only 10% of people are vaccinated.
8393,And the public doesn't think that there are a lot of cases and deaths in Russia.
8394,Because the do not see it.
8395,"Everyone in the government is already vaccinated, they tried to use propaganda, but it is met with even more anti-science conspiracy theory shit on the internet."
8396,And the internet is barely regulated and full of anti-vaxxer trolls or just straight up morons.
8397,At least twitter is trying to remove those messages.
8398,Can't say the same here.
8399,This all is very agitating to me.
8400,"But at this point I think that - if you didn't get a vaccine, and got covid - it's on you."
8401,Just for my sanity.
8402,At least I persuaded everyone I care about.
8403,Indeed.
8404,"The thing about SARS-CoV-2 is that if you leave populations of it smoldering somewhere, it will later bounce back and make a comeback."
8405,I would describe it being a virus that you should not turn your back to until it is fully destroyed.
8406,It is waiting there.
8407,"And when it starts to spread, you are quickly in big trouble, because it is so infectious."
8408,Australians look at life in most of the rest of the world now and have no issue with this current situation.
8409,Life is back to normal here.
8410,Returning citizens from India were testing positive at a scary rate  and the laws were bought in to discourage people from using a loophole of flying through Qatar to get here.
8411,DFAT have been subsidising flights for those who can't afford them for a long time.
8412,There are plenty of expats who rolled the dice and stayed overseas early last year and now can't back.
8413,"The stories mentioned in the article are the exception, not the rule."
8414,"Having said that, the government needs to pull their finger out and get purpose built quarentine built as hotels are too leaky."
8415,"No age restrictions here, but if you haven't got anything intelligent or relevant to add it would be better not to post."
8416,A lot of countries come with re-opening plans for May-June.
8417,The message is mostly that if you got the vaccine (What happen to people who got covid and have antibodies ?)
8418,you're welcome to travel in the EU.
8419,Which is good news considering that in some countries tourism is the biggest industry and in most it's a pretty nice addition to the economy
8420,This needs to be a headline nationwide.
8421,[removed]
8422,"The article notes that these are the accounted wastages, and if I understand correctly, that not all other entities report their wastage and that some wastage reports are considered unreliable."
8423,It is quite possible that the pharmacy chains have more reliable reporting because they are being paid for each vaccine administered.
8424,Or are the state vaccination clinics also reimbursed by the feds for each dose administered?
8425,Let’s hope Canada is quick on this too.
8426,There are a lot of young people preparing for part time summer work and school next fall.
8427,Never mind that they’ve already lost a full year and are about to have a second summer of restrictions.

8429,Here's a pretty cool tool that estimates population immunity for each state.

8443,*
8444,"&gt; **Vaccination is still the key**
&gt; 
&gt; The endpoint has changed, but the most pressing challenge remains the same: persuading as many people as possible to get the shot."
8445,"&gt; 
&gt; Reaching a high level of immunity in the population “is not like winning a race,” Dr. Lipsitch said."
8446,“You have to then feed it.
8447,"You have to keep vaccinating to stay above that threshold.”
&gt; 
&gt; Skepticism about the vaccines among many Americans and lack of access in some groups — homeless populations, migrant workers or some communities of color — make it a challenge to achieve that goal."
8448,"Vaccine mandates would only make that stance worse, some experts believe."
8449,"&gt; 
&gt; A better approach would be for a trusted figure to address the root cause of the hesitancy — fear, mistrust, misconceptions, ease of access or a desire for more information, said Mary Politi, an expert in health decision making and health communication at Washington University in St. Louis."
8450,"&gt; 
&gt; People often need to see others in their social circle embracing something before they are willing to try it, Dr. Politi said."
8451,"Emphasizing the benefits of vaccination to their lives, like seeing a family member or sending their children to school, might be more motivating than the nebulous idea of herd immunity."
8452,"&gt; 
&gt; “That would resonate with people more than this somewhat elusive concept that experts are still trying to figure out,” she added."
8453,"&gt; 
&gt; Though children spread the virus less efficiently than adults do, the experts all agreed that vaccinating children would also be important for keeping the number of Covid cases low."
8454,"In the long term, the public health system will also need to account for babies, and for children and adults who age into a group with higher risk."
8455,"&gt; 
&gt; Unnerving scenarios remain on the path to this long-term vision."
8456,"&gt; 
&gt; Over time, if not enough people are protected, highly contagious variants may develop that can break through vaccine protection, land people in the hospital and put them at risk of death."
8457,"&gt; 
&gt; “That’s the nightmare scenario,” said Jeffrey Shaman, an epidemiologist at Columbia University."
8458,"&gt; 
&gt; How frequent and how severe those breakthrough infections are have the potential to determine whether the United States can keep hospitalizations and deaths low or if the country will find itself in a “mad scramble” every couple of years, he said."
8459,"&gt; 
&gt; “I think we’re going to be looking over our shoulders — or at least public health officials and infectious disease epidemiologists are going to be looking over their shoulders going: ‘All right, the variants out there — what are they doing?"
8460,What are they capable of?” he said.
8461,"“Maybe the general public can go back to not worrying about it so much, but we will have to.”"
8462,"If I get sick and die, I get sick and die."
8463,I'm under no illusions that I'm guaranteed a long life free of sickness.
8464,That's the point that I'm trying to make.
8465,It's unreasonable to inconvenience everybody all of the time because there's this one medical problem going around amongst all the other medical problems.
8466,It's been quite enough already.
8467,"Many people will choose to get vaccinated, and that will make this disease quite manageable and acceptable."
8468,Let's stop chasing utopia.
8469,"&gt; **Why reaching the threshold is tough**
&gt; 
&gt; Once the novel coronavirus began to spread across the globe in early 2020, it became increasingly clear that the only way out of the pandemic would be for so many people to gain immunity — whether through natural infection or vaccination — that the virus would run out of people to infect."
8470,"The concept of reaching herd immunity became the implicit goal in many countries, including the United States."
8471,"&gt; 
&gt; Early on, the target herd immunity threshold was estimated to be about 60 to 70 percent of the population."
8472,"Most experts, including Dr. Fauci, expected that the United States would be able to reach it once vaccines were available."
8473,"&gt; 
&gt; But as vaccines were developed and distribution ramped up through the winter and into the spring, estimates of the threshold began to rise."
8474,That is because the initial calculations were based on the contagiousness of the original version of the virus.
8475,"The predominant variant now circulating in the United States, called B.1.1.7 and first identified in Britain, is about 60 percent more transmissible."
8476,"&gt; 
&gt; As a result, experts now calculate the herd immunity threshold to be at least 80 percent."
8477,"If even more contagious variants develop, or if scientists find that immunized people can still transmit the virus, the calculation will have to be revised upward again."
8478,"&gt; 
&gt; Polls show that about 30 percent of the U.S. population is still reluctant to be vaccinated."
8479,That number is expected to improve but probably not enough.
8480,"“It is theoretically possible that we could get to about 90 percent vaccination coverage, but not super likely, I would say,” said Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H."
8481,Chan School of Public Health.
8482,"&gt; 
&gt; Though resistance to the vaccines is a main reason the United States is unlikely to reach herd immunity, it is not the only one."
8483,"&gt; 
&gt; Herd immunity is often described as a national target."
8484,But that is a hazy concept in a country this large.
8485,"&gt; 
&gt; “Disease transmission is local,” Dr. Lipsitch noted."
8486,"&gt; 
&gt; “If the coverage is 95 percent in the United States as a whole, but 70 percent in some small town, the virus doesn’t care,” he explained."
8487,"“It will make its way around the small town.”
&gt; 
&gt; How insulated a particular region is from the coronavirus depends on a dizzying array of factors."
8488,"&gt; 
&gt; Herd immunity can fluctuate with “population crowding, human behavior, sanitation and all sorts of other things,” said Dr. David M. Morens, a virologist and senior adviser to Dr. Fauci."
8489,"“The herd immunity for a wealthy neighborhood might be X, then you go into a crowded neighborhood one block away and it’s 10X.”
&gt; 
&gt; Given the degree of movement among regions, a small virus wave in a region with a low vaccination level can easily spill over into an area where a majority of the population is protected."
8490,"&gt; 
&gt; At the same time, the connectivity between countries, particularly as travel restrictions ease, emphasizes the urgency of protecting not just Americans but everyone in the world, said Natalie E. Dean, a biostatistician at the University of Florida in Gainesville."
8491,"Any variants that arise in the world will eventually reach the United States, she noted."
8492,"&gt; 
&gt; Many parts of the world lag far behind the United States on vaccinations."
8493,"Less than 2 percent of the people in India have been fully vaccinated, for example, and less than 1 percent in South Africa, according to data compiled by The New York Times."
8494,"&gt; 
&gt; “We will not achieve herd immunity as a country or a state or even as a city until we have enough immunity in the population as a whole,” said Lauren Ancel Meyers, the director of the Covid-19 Modeling Consortium at the University of Texas at Austin."
8495,"&gt; 
&gt; **What the future may hold**
&gt; 
&gt; If the herd immunity threshold is not attainable, what matters most is the rate of hospitalizations and deaths after pandemic restrictions are relaxed, experts believe."
8496,"&gt; 
&gt; By focusing on vaccinating the most vulnerable, the United States has already brought those numbers down sharply."
8497,"If the vaccination levels of that group continue to rise, the expectation is that over time the coronavirus may become seasonal, like the flu, and affect mostly the young and healthy."
8498,"&gt; 
&gt; “What we want to do at the very least is get to a point where we have just really sporadic little flare-ups,” said Carl Bergstrom, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Washington in Seattle."
8499,"“That would be a very sensible target in this country where we have an excellent vaccine and the ability to deliver it.”
&gt; 
&gt; Over the long term — a generation or two — the goal is to transition the new coronavirus to become more like its cousins that cause common colds."
8500,"That would mean the first infection is early in childhood, and subsequent infections are mild because of partial protection, even if immunity wanes."
8501,"&gt; 
&gt; Some unknown proportion of people with mild cases may go on to experience debilitating symptoms for weeks or months — a syndrome called “long Covid” — but they are unlikely to overwhelm the health care system."
8502,"&gt; 
&gt; “The vast majority of the mortality and of the stress on the health care system comes from people with a few particular conditions, and especially people who are over 60,” Dr. Lipsitch said."
8503,"“If we can protect those people against severe illness and death, then we will have turned Covid from a society disrupter to a regular infectious disease.”
&gt; 
&gt; If communities maintain vigilant testing and tracking, it may be possible to bring the number of new cases so low that health officials can identify any new introduction of the virus and immediately stifle a potential outbreak, said Bary Pradelski, an economist at the National Center for Scientific Research in Grenoble, France."
8504,He and his colleagues described this strategy in a paper published on Thursday in the scientific journal The Lancet.
8505,"&gt; 
&gt; “Eradication is, I think, impossible at this stage,” Dr. Pradelski said."
8506,"“But you want local elimination.”
&gt;"
8507,"&gt; Early in the pandemic, when vaccines for the coronavirus were still just a glimmer on the horizon, the term “herd immunity” came to signify the endgame: the point when enough Americans would be protected from the virus so we could be rid of the pathogen and reclaim our lives."
8508,"&gt; 
&gt; Now, more than half of adults in the United States have been inoculated with at least one dose of a vaccine."
8509,"But daily vaccination rates are slipping, and there is widespread consensus among scientists and public health experts that the herd immunity threshold is not attainable — at least not in the foreseeable future, and perhaps not ever."
8510,"&gt; 
&gt; Instead, they are coming to the conclusion that rather than making a long-promised exit, the virus will most likely become a manageable threat that will continue to circulate in the United States for years to come, still causing hospitalizations and deaths but in much smaller numbers."
8511,"&gt; 
&gt; How much smaller is uncertain and depends in part on how much of the nation, and the world, becomes vaccinated and how the coronavirus evolves."
8512,"It is already clear, however, that the virus is changing too quickly, new variants are spreading too easily and vaccination is proceeding too slowly for herd immunity to be within reach anytime soon."
8513,"&gt; 
&gt; Continued immunizations, especially for people at highest risk because of age, exposure or health status, will be crucial to limiting the severity of outbreaks, if not their frequency, experts believe."
8514,"&gt; 
&gt; “The virus is unlikely to go away,” said Rustom Antia, an evolutionary biologist at Emory University in Atlanta."
8515,"“But we want to do all we can to check that it’s likely to become a mild infection.”
&gt; 
&gt; The shift in outlook presents a new challenge for public health authorities."
8516,"The drive for herd immunity — by the summer, some experts once thought possible — captured the imagination of large segments of the public."
8517,To say the goal will not be attained adds another “why bother” to the list of reasons that vaccine skeptics use to avoid being inoculated.
8518,"&gt; 
&gt; Yet vaccinations remain the key to transforming the virus into a controllable threat, experts said."
8519,"&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the Biden administration’s top adviser on Covid-19, acknowledged the shift in experts’ thinking."
8520,"&gt; 
&gt; “People were getting confused and thinking you’re never going to get the infections down until you reach this mystical level of herd immunity, whatever that number is,” he said."
8521,"&gt; 
&gt; “That’s why we stopped using herd immunity in the classic sense,” he added."
8522,“I’m saying: Forget that for a second.
8523,"You vaccinate enough people, the infections are going to go down.”"
8524,"Saw a friend this weekend... she, her husband, and both her kids got COVD - BAD."
8525,"Lost taste for weeks, bad flu-like symptoms, etc."
8526,"She's telling me the story and finally goes ""and I know the vaccine works, because my parents were vaccinated and were over earlier, the day we tested positive."
8527,My kids were all over them and you know my husband is a close talker.
8528,"They both tested negative."""
8529,"Now.. idk about incubation periods and all, but if what we're being told is true: that pre-symptomatic can spread it, then it sounds like it worked pretty well."
8530,"And we're on Long Island, and based on their town and the timing, there's a solid chance it was one of the main variants."
8531,[deleted]
8532,Gotcha.
8533,I’m glad they are getting vaccinated.
8534,Your comment seemed to imply they were not.
8535,Definitely an extra bonus to have the kids vaccinated but I wouldn’t have worried about it too much if every other person they were going to be exposed to was fully vaccinated.
8536,Real world studies are showing the vaccines are very good at preventing transmissions as well as infections.
8537,"We are Canadians, we help, because thats how we do"
8538,Kinda bonkers that (s)he had to wait this long to get it but better late than never I guess
8539,I guess I’m too young for this sub.
8540,The /s at the end of the sentence means sarcasm at the young side of Reddit
8541,I don't think you two are disagreeing and really don't get the vote discrepancy.
8542,He said that immunity will start to wear off as years go by.
8543,"Studies show it starts to wear off even before the year mark even though as you say, some protection is retained for a long time (how long we don't really know yet)."
8544,This virus isn't going away.
8545,"Like he said, even under a best case, it's going to exist in the background."
8546,And I would expect that as years go by and we get further disconnected from this that people will be more and more lax about getting vaccine updates.
8547,Just like many people didn't really prioritize getting a flu vaccine before this.
8548,"And as that happens, combined with possible changes with the virus, we're eventually going to see COVID surges again just like we get bad flu seasons."
8549,"We have to vaccine all the susceptible animals, too!"

8552,I had zero side effects from either Pfizer shot and that’s been the norm among most people I know.
8553,[removed]
8554,"Unfortunately, that's a naive sentiment that will only put you and your loved ones in danger."
8555,"Safe is not a black-and-white thing, it's matter of degrees."
8556,"Even with the best available vaccine, a [~20% chance of infection](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7013e3.htm) is still a hugely significant individual risk for a virus that's still rampantly circulating."
8557,That 20% refers your chance of infection when exposed.
8558,"If you're going to throw caution to the wind, you're chance of being exposed skyrockets."
8559,I'll repeat: vaccines are as much a population-level measure as they are a individual one.
8560,"The measles vaccine displays similar efficacy to the mRNA COVID vaccines, but measles is practically eradicated in the western world -- thanks to population-level vaccinations -- which is why no one shuts down the economy when there is a rare measles outbreak among an unvaccinated group of idiots."
8561,That high level of protection is powerful at scale and can't gain a foothold when it has no further hosts to infect.
8562,This is all to say... we are not all protected until *we're all protected.
8563,"*  Until then, we all need to continue do our part."
8564,"Selfish ""I got mine, fuck everyone else"" attitudes are only going to stretch out this crisis further."
8565,The good news is that won't be much longer.
8566,"We seem to be averaging at a pace of about 1% a day and are currently at over 33% with a first dose, so we'll hit 50% by mid-May."
8567,"By the end of the month, that 50% will have taken effect and I think we're going to hit a real turning point."
8568,"Also by the end of the month, we'll hit 70%."
8569,This could be practically over in six short weeks.
8570,Hang in there.

8585,"After the Games were postponed for a year because of the coronavirus pandemic, Suriano doubled down, skipping another year of college and moving to Phoenix from his home in New Jersey to join a special training group."

8588,"“I was at the healthiest point in my life,” he said."
8589,"&gt;But only days before the start of the trials on April 2 in Texas, a nasal swab changed everything."

8623,No jab no job.
8624,"Don't play with these people, take their livelihoods away if they want to fuck around."
8625,"Most, if not all by then, of the adults have been vaccinated, it’s just that remaining slim chance of a vaccinated person still being able to carry some virus load."
8626,We hav a trip planned in July that involves a lake house being shard by a group.
8627,Our two youngest would have been the only non-vaccinated people.
8628,"That being said, the revelation that the people group I was raised in have become something I have to treat with extra caution and consideration has certainly been one of the big lessons of the past year."
8629,Family is a mixed bag for sure.
8630,The purpose of getting the vaccine was always more about public health than personal protection—but that’s not how you sell people on doing the thing.
8631,"Finally got my wife to go get her first shot on Saturday, there was some fuckery and she was about to get fed up but she persevered so I'm proud of her for that"
8632,"
&gt; It was a general response to all actually."
8633,Both sides of the debate.

8636,It’s really starting to look like you can’t…
8637,Just so long as it doesn't inconvenient _you_ right?
8638,"Or maybe, they had the vaccine long before they released the virus in a controlled way...."
8639,They'll bring out the vaccine when the whole world is in dire straits
8640,I think you’ll get there soon.
8641,I believe they’re just discussing and planning ahead for the days when most are vaccinated.
8642,Opening up businesses and flights require time and planning.
8643,"In my city, we went from not many vaccinated in February/March to 60% by the end April, and our new cases have dropped dramatically."
8644,The city has reopened.
8645,Now many places are having difficult time hiring people so suddenly.
8646,(It is a different discussion about how many were unemployed.)
8647,It might be that no one ultimately knows.

8653,I work for a US textile company and we spent some time looking at treatments for textiles that would make them longer lasting for use in PPE.
8654,Probably not so much for masks but they were for scrubs/gowns/medical drapery/etc.
8655,We can actually impregnate bleach into fabric so that it is only released during a wash cycle and have it be multi-wash capable.
8656,I am sure companies are looking at all kinds of solutions for PPE.
8657,Kimberly Clark has a plant here in our town making the duckbill N95-type masks.
8658,These guys just can't catch a break lately.
8659,Israel has found 41 cases of Indias variant in it's population.
8660,Only 4 of which have been vaccinated.
8661,It's a small sample size but that would equate to around 95% efficacy for Pfizer against the variant.
8662,My wife works in infectious disease for one of the top hospitals in the US.
8663,They had 2800 hospitalizations for Covid in the month of April.
8664,Not ONE of those hospitalizations were vaccinated.
8665,The vaccines work and they work against variants so far.
8666,We need to push the global vaccination effort and if it requires fully authorizing the current mRNA vaccines and making them mandatory then so be it.
8667,I know I will be downvoted for suggesting mandatory vaccinations and I am all for personal freedom but a global health crisis is not a matter of PERSONAL freedom when it puts the lives of others at risk.
8668,It’s a question of what story we are telling ourselves.
8669,"Is it a story like polio, where infections are nearly eliminated?"
8670,This is what we imagine when we use the term herd immunity.
8671,"Or is it a story like the flu, a stalemate where we can expect hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations and tens of thousands of deaths per annum?"
8672,"This isn’t the herd immunity we were hoping for, but since it’s the best we’re likely to achieve it’s probably time to retire the phrase, and the expectation, moving forward."
8673,"Ooof who kmows what they're injecting people with :/ yikes, their own officials have been caught avoiding the vaccine cus they dont trust it."
8674,"FY1 and FY2 (foundation years training, aka straight out of uni) pay is £28k and 33k respectively."
8675,They may earn more from doing extra hours but their base is not £38k.
8676,"Also have to consider after the foundation years training, it's probably another 6-8 years to become a consultant."
8677,So we're talking 10 years of working to get to 80-100k pay range.
8678,Most end up working privately on the side to supplement this.
8679,"You're right though, locum work can pay very well if you're willing to put in the extra hours for it."
8680,You could literally spend your days sucking on used testing kits and spitting on the elderly after getting vaccinated and you’re still unlikely to give anyone COVID.

8682,"I felt tired after the first plus sore arm, nothing after the second, not even my arm other than the bruise from the needle (they hit something weird)."
8683,I got pfizer 3 weeks apart.
8684,IIRC Denmark returned the AZ vaccines to the EU scheme they were purchased under and they went to severely affected EU countries like Lithuania.
8685,I guess it'll be the same for J&amp;J.

8721,&gt; ... the fact that a critical mass of people cannot recognize the value in a vaccine during a pandemic doesn't speak highly of us.
8722,Preach it Brother!
8723,There’s gotta be a better way to say that…
8724,Lots of places require that you don’t give food and drink to voters.
8725,So happy for you!!!

8729,The growth is exponential.
8730,Hope you and your community can get it soon!
8731,over 200 different viruses make up colds.
8732,I haven't heard before that cold viruses mutate fast (especially the coronaviruses).
8733,"I was under the impression that as antibodies wane, you retain your tcells and bcells and that helps protect you when you get the same virus again in a couple of years (which is what I'm hoping covid turns into for natural and vaccine immunity)."
8734,IANAD so I'd love to hear if that's wrong.
8735,The UK denies?
8736,Huh?
8737,Again that doesn’t negate what China has done.
8738,Not sure what your point is.
8739,The US has a good vaccination program so does China
8740,I’m curious why you don’t just cut contact with people who don’t believe in science and don’t want to keep themselves or your children safe by getting vaccinated.
8741,If a vaccine weren’t approved for children would you have let them around your unvaccinated relatives?
8742,"God, how utterly selfish you are"
8743,Is there any Chinese official web page like cds or Israel that how many dosed done for each age groups?
8744,Also which vacccines are done?
8745,Our country could not get Chinese vaccine(Sinovac) however China can vaccinate people 7million a day.
8746,So I am curious where is the problem?

Here's a newsflash: you didn't contribute anything to society by blowing/taking loads."

8770,"It is possible herd immunity will not be reached, right?"
8771,What if only 60% of the total population is at least partially vaccinated and only 1/5th of the total population has been infected.
8772,Which means around 70% should have immunity against COVID-19.
8773,"This might have been just enough for the older variants, but possible not enough for the newer variants."
8774,"This is assuming both vaccine and natural immunity is 100%, which it is not."
8775,"What if another variant pops up due to a partially immune population that is less effected by ""old"" immunity (like making immunity against old variants 20% less effective) you have even less protection in the population."
8776,"Another problem is that vaccine hesitancy will not be evenly distributed, so there might be places that will have reached herd immunity, while other places are not even close to herd immunity."
8777,"This leads to the virus spreading mostly freely in certain places, again increasing the risks of worrying variants to form."
8778,This might all be a worst case scenario.
8779,"More people might want to get a vaccine, more people might have already been infected and there will not be any more worrying mutations, it is all plausible."
8780,"Herd immunity might be too difficult to achieve, but cases, hospitalisations and deaths can be significantly reduced."
8781,"Herd immunity is the best/perfect outcome, but it is not too bad if it is not achieved."
8782,"What is certain, is that enough will be vaccinated to significantly slow the spread of the virus and vulnerable people being mostly protected to prevent most of the deaths and hospitalisations, meaning the risk is acceptable and thus everything can open up again."
8783,How long did people search for that stretch article in support of anti-vaxx?
8784,"The article ignores the deaths and long term effects from measles, mumps, etc."
8785,which are very high and certain consequences.
8786,"If these diseases weren’t dangerous to children and unvaccinated adults, we wouldn’t have developed or even needed the vaccines."

8847,I wish we could ban travel to and from the states that are doing worse.
8848,NY shouldn’t be at risk because we have to let people from Alabama come.
8849,This seems a little intense...
8850,It was my understanding that vaccine manufacturers are basically immune to lawsuits because when an individual consents to a vaccine they're acknowledging the risk of adverse effects and signing away their right to complain.
8851,Maybe Pfizer is trying to cover because they acknowledge the risk may be increased because of the new technology?

8914,I invite you to put some logic behind your ‘braindead move’ statement and explain why your opinion is the correct one for Denmark as opposed to the opinion of the best medical scientists in a first world country.
8915,Every country on earth had an issue with supply a couple of months ago.
8916,Because it takes a couple of months to produce it.
8917,And the propaganda is not very effective.
8918,"I think the biggest hope right now is a word of mouth, about the lack of side effects, and its efficacy at producing anti-bodies, or maybe if they'll see that bill gates doesn't mind control you with his microchips, or whatever they think they inject you with."
8919,"They're probably worried that the virus would manage to escape the quarantine facilities, which is a real concern given how contagious the Indian variant seems to be"
8920,As far as I know only Denmark and Sweden in the EU have stopped.
8921,"Norway will probably stop, but they have to decide before 10th of May."
8922,I saw someone suggest that only vaccinated people can vote.
8923,I could see that causing the idiots to line up to get the shot real quick.

8925,"I'm guessing the ""99% survival rate"" of Covid, giving the 1% chance to die from it."

8927,Cases of animal to human are vanishingly rare.
8928,"The vaccines are incredible, but to control the virus we need near perfect compliance."
8929,It’s like measles.
8930,Get almost everyone vaccinated and outbreaks will be very rare and can be addressed as they occur.
8931,"If measles was still spreading endemically at this level, it would be a public health disaster promoting strong responses from the government."

8933,There is nothing that could develop from the use of vaccine passports that would be concerning to me.
8934,I would be fine with mandatory vaccinations more broadly though.

8936,There is no reason we can’t regulate the operation of these programs.
8937,"UK's regional approach slowly failed, it's difficult to pull off"
8938,Wait they’re saying 3.6k in total?
8939,There’s no way...
8940,Norway has had a total of 6\* deaths in the entire 0-39 group.
8941,"Norway has roughly 2.5-3\*\* million people in that age span, which means that roughly **1 in 400 000** has died of covid in that age span **during the whole pandemic**."
8942,"Of course, the risk assessment is a lot harder than that as you also need to take additional parameters into account (availability of alternative vaccines, current and projected rate of spread, effect on hospitalization and society at large etc)."
8943,But my point is that it could make sense to restrict AstraZeneca and wait for other vaccines in some situations (but as the situation varies a lot between countries the best is to simply follow your nation's guidelines).

8951,"We didn't know exactly how the virus was causing problems in our bodies, but we knew what the virus looked like, so we knew what the spike it uses to attach itself to cells looks like."
8952,"The blueprints are in the vaccine (mRNA = blueprints) and our cells read the directions, make some spikes, and then the immune system notices, goes ""oh shit, this is something we need to attack"" (which is why you might feel like crap from the vaccine, because your immune system is yelling and attacking the spikes your cells made)."
8953,"So now your body has learned how to make antibodies that 'recognize' the spike, so if you do encounter the virus, your immune system will be like ""ha!"

8981,"We don't quite know how common this, probably more common than symptomatic, but asymptomatic people are less infectious, so it's pretty unlikely that they'd first get an asymptomatic reinfection AND then also go on to infect someone else."
8982,"I guess technically they could not get infected, the virus would not be multiplying in their system, and they'd just act as a living walking surface for the virus from someone else."
8983,"But fomite spread is known to be almost irrelevant, and a soft wet surface like a human will be particularly hard on the virus, so this probably never happens in practice."

9040,Just adding the one drawback I see.
9041,Two doses isn't about body size or whatever.

9201,For people under thirty this is even true when Covid figures are high.
9202,"For Australia this would mean about 120 young people getting very serious side-effects, about a quarter would die and about half would have life-changing disabilities."
9203,So it makes absolutely no sense at all to use this vaccin for younger people (women in particular) in a country like Australia when other safer vaccins exist.
9204,"For results to happen they have to get X amount of people infected with covid, in order to be able to compare the placebo group vs the vaccine group."
9205,I guess they are waiting to get that amount of people in order to release the data
9206,"With the idea of reported vs real COVID counts, is there any information on why China's numbers are so low?"
9207,"For a population of billions I would have thought they would look much more like India, but their reported deaths are under 5,000."
9208,I've read a few articles that detail just how extreme their lockdowns were.
9209,When you have an authoritarian government you can really do a full quarantine for everyone to an extent that no Western population would agree to.
9210,Did that kind of control actually work or are they just not reporting the real numbers?
9211,"Just so you understand with a different scenario, someone who chops off both feet can recover."
9212,They've lost something permanently but they're alive and well.
9213,"With covid, we still dont know the long term effects of contracting it, and it seems that organ function like brain and lungs does not operate at full capacity"
9214,2 people are dying per day.
9215,That is more than 5 total.
9216,"Your two points cancel each other, but thanks."
9217,I ACCPET the the risk is orders of magnitude lower that  will happen.
9218,Which is why everyone eligible EXCEPT for total morons want to be vaccinated.

9221,I pray for him &amp; your family.
9222,Virologists suspect that patients like your uncle give rise to new mutations as the virus multiplies &amp; tries to evade advanced therapies.
9223,Even rare bacteria proliferate in patients given immuno-suppressants and anti-virals.
9224,The organization that just last week said it was okay to not wear a mask outside if you're vaccinated?
9225,"Yeesh, we'll be waiting eons."
9226,"I'm still taking full precautions when I go to work, but that is only because our vaccination rate here is low and I have some ultra high risk family members."
9227,Also because of the type of place I work and type of people who frequent it.
9228,I would say assess where you live for risk and then make an informed decision on what makes you feel comfortable.
9229,"I think I will relax more and start doing more when I see more people locally vaccinated if that miracle occurs, and if infection rates go down here considerably, and also I want to see what the scientists will be saying about new variants a little down the road."
9230,And once the kids in my family are all vaccinated.
9231,Especially the one who is at risk for complications.
9232,[removed]
9233,Progress is being made but there are still too many illogical/contradictory statements.
9234,There's no reason for wearing a mask outdoors.
9235,Social distancing and surface sanitation are just theater for a disease that is airborne.
9236,Vaccinated people should be allowed to go on with life as normal (I realize this has challenges with regard to proving vaccination).
9237,https://youtu.be/moyotZFLjjg
9238,"&gt;Or just wait (allegedly) another month and change for all of the at risk individuals to get vaccinated and then loosen the restrictions for everyone

So basically keeping the restrictions for everyone?"
9239,Why?
9240,"As a pediatrician, it’s my sad duty to inform you that there are 400lb 12 year olds."
9241,Also vaccines aren’t going to have the same dosing as medications do.
9242,"And once a kid hits 90-100lbs(ish) most of the time we use adult dosing, tends to be around age 12 for most."
9243,"From what I’ve heard, they actually give a smaller doses to the the 12-15 kids."
9244,It’s a 6-10 month process usually.
9245,The FDA has been doing this for EUA in mere weeks.
9246,The best time to begin increasing vaccine production capacity is today if it wasn’t started yesterday.
9247,There’s no need to delay it any further.
9248,The companies Pfizer and moderna rejected to cooperate with a plan in the fall which would’ve had vaccine production going now.
9249,Barely anyone is dying in Denmark from COVID.
9250,We have had **2** people under 50 die total since the pandemic started (without co-mobidities) and **0** under 30.
9251,"We've vaccinated everyone that wanted a vaccine above 50 within the next couple of weeks, so it's basically the under 50s that are at risk of contracting COVID now in Denmark."
9252,"And if only two people under that age group has died of COVID since the pandemic started, that means that the vaccine have already killed far more young people than COVID would have."
9253,It's pretty safe to say that - at least for Denmark - it's pretty stupid to hand out vaccines with deadly side effects when barely anyone is dying.
9254,This is news?
9255,We knew about this last April
9256,&gt; It’s their risk now.
9257,And the risk of those that can't get vaccinated because of actual health reasons.

9260,"Capacity restrictions, random things closed, masks everywhere, etc."
9261,"-- none of that is normal, so it doesn't feel normal."
9262,And this right here is why healthy people choosing not to get vaccinated are awful.
9263,"Herd immunity requires all viable individuals to be immunized, otherwise those who can’t be immunized will always be at risk."
9264,"Yeah, but I perrsonally wouldn't expect COVAX - the initiative set to end Covid-19 in lower income countries with a limited budget - to essentially buy the most expensive vaccine."
9265,"Unless it's ""lower tiered"" price is a large percentage of it's original price."
9266,Let's hope so anyway.
9267,No it isn’t.
9268,That’s your definition.
9269,No one ever says no masks means fully reopened.
9270,New Yorkers are glad to be able to go out and meet and have activities even if it means wearing a mask in a crowd.
9271,This is huge good news for the city.
9272,"&gt; I'm worried about millions and millions of infections in India and elsewhere, not the infections among US children."
9273,Put your worry where the bulk of the risk is.
9274,The problem with India is that a large part of the population is very poor with little/no access to proper sanitation or health care.
9275,And some of these areas are very densely populated.
9276,estimate is short and is constantly lengthening as the trial period goes.
9277,It's disingenuous to say the vaccines last 6 months
9278,Has there been any death conclusively linked to the vaccine so far?
9279,Of course not

9307,Read you loud and clear.
9308,Good luck with your natural immunity there.👌

9310,Something like that.
9311,With the AZ vaccine they thought it would lead to 5 cases of serious blood clotting.
9312,And on the other hand prevent one hospitalisation to the ICU.
9313,J&amp;J seems to have fewer cases with serious blood clotting but we had ordereda higher number of their vaccine.
9314,Now we are also a month further ahead with the pandemic even under more control so risk of catching covid is decreasing
9315,Does anyone know if anything came of the initial hypothesis that the MMR vaccine is somewhat effective against Sars-CoV-2 which is why children are facing less severe infection and less long term side effects?

9365,The incentive to get vaccinated is *to actually solve the problem*.
9366,Normalcy isn’t something the government creates - it’s an end result of taking the right actions to fix a problem.

9420,Even after completing vaccination you could still spread it/mutate it.
9421,Until most of the nation is past the minimum threshold for immunity to take root and us to quell the tide of this pandemic we need to continue masking/distancing (in most circumstances).
9422,People need to stop acting like the moment they complete vaccinations it's peachy to stop distancing or masking in general (obviously it's determined safe to interact exclusively with other vaccinated people but only outdoors/not up close).

9436,"If they put samples in a fridge in January and tested them in March, they can only verify efficacy after 3 months of storage (plus time to test.)"

9442,Do they just have to get longer trial period?

9449,"You didn't make as much money as you would have, but you did ok."
9450,&gt;So what are the thoughts now on all the news reports that we aren’t likely to reach herd immunity?
9451,Scare mongering.
9452,Herd immunity is not some binary thing where one day a country doesn't have it and the next day it does when a number is reached.
9453,We're on track to have 67% of adults vaccinated by end of this month and 20%+ of those unvaxxed likely have natural immunity from prior infection.
9454,"Might not be optimal, but by the end of this month it will be enough."
9455,So the likely hood of another shutdown due to a variant is unlikely ?
9456,Huh - What are you talking about?
9457,Which virus is that?
9458,It’s not measles or chicken pox.
9459,"Vaccines basically just mimic an infection, just without the symptoms."
9460,"Twitter, Facebook etc are private companies, they have the right to do whatever the fuck they want as long as it's legal."
9461,And I don't think we want the government mandating what can and can't be said on social media.
9462,I am always confused about the Republican approach to this.
9463,"They don't want govt restriction, but then again want govt regulation to force private companies to unban people on a private website."
9464,What gives?
9465,"In Pfizer's phase 1/2  [data](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2639-4.pdf), they tried 3 different doses, 10ug, 30ug, and 100ug."
9466,"100ug had a less strong immune response and more side effects than 30ug, which also had a strong immune response."
9467,10ug did not generate strong enough immune response in some of the partcipants.
9468,They would have done similar trials with 12+ year olds.
9469,I'm hoping to see them publish this data.
9470,I don't think it would be harder to distribute different doses.
9471,"If kids need half the dose, they could just pull half the volume from the vials."
9472,I doubt that was a factor at all.
9473,It may be over blown.
9474,They mentioned this on npr and had a health expert also say that yeah vaccine rate could ramp down a bit but it will just take a little longer to reach heard immunity.
9475,I think they came out today and said herd immunity is not likely
9476,I am very very excited to go out when restrictions are removed.

9507,I wonder if this is a “carrot” to encourage the vaccine hesitant.
9508,"Germany is doing pretty well, but the latest yougov poll shows 30% of adults not wanting to be vaccinated, so not enough for herd immunity."
9509,"It seems very unfair otherwise, and likely to build resentment between generations."
9510,"Other countries are just relaxing rules slowly for everyone, rather than faster for the vaccinated."
9511,We have already started to hit the early points of wide spread immunity causing cases to be decreasing.
9512,Some areas are going to be very well off while other places will deal with out breaks.
9513,Didn't biontech devlop it?
9514,And pfizer is the manufacturer?
9515,It doesn't mean vaccine passport for international travel.
9516,"It's a ban on vaccine passports for domestic shit like going to walmart, home depot, the gas station, etc."
9517,"The feds will handle any kind of ""vaccine passport"" for international travel in the same way they do the yellow card attached to your passport."
9518,"Some minor political hype, nothing to get excited about."

9522,A big concept in mental health is putting yourself first sometimes and being ok with disappointing people/having other people accept your choices.

9525,I guarantee that woman still travels by automobile multiple times a week.
9526,I'm also uncomfortable around needles.
9527,I just look the other way.
9528,"Honestly it's over in less than 2 seconds, and it's barely a pinch."
9529,You'll be okay.
9530,"I’m definitely doing more “normal” things than I was pre-vaccination, but I find it hard to just immediately go back to normal."
9531,Especially since case counts have been pretty steady in my area the last few weeks.
9532,Hoping that as case counts drop the mental barrier will go away too
9533,Okay thanks.
9534,Like I said based on the timeline of the 12-15 if the 5-11 moves at the same rate they'd complete in August and then likely be approved around the same time line this is following.
9535,So speculation based on the science that's already been done as they don't expect any issues aside from figuring out dosing.
9536,Lol it's not even enforced mate

Rough day but need to remember we are in the end game."
9541,Hopefully 12-15 gets approved this week and we can see a nice little bump from them.
9542,Numbers will be adjusted once they are approved.
9543,Last weeks data isn't complete for date of death.
9544,"The latest 7-day period is 83 deaths, so averaging 12."
9545,The 110 figure will be including deaths from before.
9546,well if that is what makes them feel safe then so be it.

9560,"The reasons I suggested blockchain are:

9561,"Now, I agree that fraud is an issue and it always is."
9562,"If there’s a “permanent fraud” in the blockchain, then it can be invalidated via (higher level) blockchain meta data, which also creates a public audit record."
9563,"Databases always face the question of audit and inaccuracies, so that wasn’t my point in the OP, so what do you think about my other 3 points?"
9564,Wouldn't be acceptable here.
9565,"We don't have a low uptake at all, in fact it's like 95%."
9566,Unfair to make those rules when people haven't been offered the jab yet.
9567,However next month all restrictions are gone.
9568,"Yes, but deaths for today can be reported later as well."
9569,Begin by taking credit for a vaccine developed by another company.
9570,Obesity is very very different because having that much extra fat mass will cause you to have a huge difference hormonally to an average person.
9571,"You'd really need to see more studies to see if it's really ""mass related"" vs fat mass and body fat percentage."
9572,It could be related more to insulin resistance or other hormonal issues.
9573,That study isn't making the conclusion you're interpreting from it.

9581,The vaccinators have had so much practice giving shots you don’t even feel it at all.
9582,Just sit down and look the other way and count to like fifteen.
9583,It’s over so fast.
9584,Also if you get Covid bad youd be stuffed full of way more needles.
9585,So it’s getting a quick one now to potentially avoid a bunch of IVs down the road.
9586,Probably won't be a big deal.
9587,By the time these states get any vaccine passport system in place it won't matter.
9588,Even then I doubt they would be as open even with the passport in comparison to anti passport states.
9589,I can't change the headlines
9590,My wife and I are both fully vaccinated and pre covid were planning a road trip through France/Belgium.
9591,I will be thrilled if we can actually do it this year.
9592,What do you mean ?
9593,Passports ?
9594,vaccinations ?
9595,"travel papers were mentioned in the bible ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport#History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport#History) ), smallpox vaccines were required first in 1944."
9596,"Of course, COVID-19 testing/vaccines could not have been required before 2019 :)"
9597,I can't change the headline
9598,Because I don't answer to you.
9599,"I have no reason to explain why I feel the way I feel, because at the end of the day, it's irrelevant."
9600,"I still have done what I've been asked to (mask, distance, vaccinate-ive done all of it)."
9601,"You're *literally* proving my point; because of a difference of opinion you're calling me paranoid, anti-science, etc."
9602,"It's not enough for me to be in compliance, if I'm not aligned with your belief system then I'm committing thought crime."
9603,People like you can't see past their own nose.
9604,We're talking about the Olympics.
9605,"I agree that Oktoberfest is probably too uncertain to be financially viable, although it would probably be fine by October."
9606,[removed]
9607,Fully agreed.
9608,Masks are absolutely a covid restriction.
9609,What are they trying to sell us?
9610,Hospitals do
9611,You can absolutely still catch coronavirus after being fully vaccinated with any of the vaccines.
9612,Your chances of hospitalization and death are lower.
9613,It looks vaccinated people are not contagious (not a carrier) when they catch coronavirus from an unvaccinated person.
9614,There is no meaningful data yet on vaccinated people catching coronavirus and having long covid symptoms.
9615,There is some data on long covid people getting vaccinated (post infection) and relieving symptoms.
9616,That's definitely a concern and an issue with medical testing (most medical testing tends to be done on adult white males so they don't catch issues always with dosing or sex related side effects) but not every medicine is dosed based on body size.
9617,Wear earbuds and listen to music.
9618,Tell the person giving your shot about your anxiety beforehand.
9619,"Do you have panic attacks, if so, maybe consider taking medication prior to vaccination if you are prescribed any."
9620,Can you share any research/evidence to back this up?
9621,I was just having a conversation with parents of teen girls who are especially concerned about the potential unknowns of vaccination on girls during puberty (with some specific mention of how vaccines may impact the uterine wall).
9622,"This is not my area of expertise and I did try to research this concern, but I couldn't find anything."
9623,I want to be able to share documented research/evidence of the potential unknowns to vaccines.
9624,"Or relaxing the restrictions a bit for everyone, as is happening in other countries."
9625,you're gonna have a great week!
9626,.
9627,I agree I think its a great idea.
9628,I'm glad that I got mine 2 months ago and will happily pay $6 for the beer.

9630,Sounds like he should be a sofware inganeer
9631,I’d wait to see once cases drop down to record low levels to see if this stays.
9632,It would also be helpful for these anxious people if the CDC released more data on the variants vs vaccines.
9633,Right now people are just getting anecdotal info off Twitter which isn’t helping.
9634,Luckily we have Israel but the CDC really should have been conducting more tests.
9635,On the flip side there are also people staying mainly in who want to just wait till the mask mandate is gone.
9636,I have relatives that don’t want to spend a lot on vacation to have a bunch of mask restaurant pictures.
9637,Not that they are against masks but just they feel the vacation would be less fun and prices aren’t cheap anymore too for them.
9638,"We may not ever reach herd immunity, but vaccination will still bring cases down to a manageable level."
9639,"Hopefully, some treatments for more severe cases will become available, if an unvaccinated person were to become sick."
9640,"Once the vaccine is open to every age group including pediatrics, covid won’t be the same problem it is now."
9641,"In fact, it may well be before kids can get the shot, that we will see the end of the crisis point since adults are the major risk group."
9642,We don’t necessarily need herd immunity for things to vastly improve.
9643,Wait really?
9644,"Right, which is exactly the message I'm saying they're sending - that as of now, they *still* think it's too risky to count on it for this fall."
9645,"The comment I responded to said that it wasn't pessimistic, because these things take a long time to plan, but it does indicate that they're taking a pessimistic view on things - that is, that there's a reasonable chance that it wouldn't be able to happen if they planned it."
9646,Is there any study on effectively of current vaccines against the indian strain?
9647,"You’re being downvoted because you used the wrong word, but the sentiment is there."
9648,"While I understand the value of being vaccinated and it’s importance in us reaching herd immunity, I really resent these “vaccine passports”."
9649,A vaccinated person infected with COVID can spread the virus just as easily as an unvaccinated who is asymptotic.
9650,"That is to say, it’s a hell of a lot less than a symptomatic person, it’s sure as shit not zero."
9651,The vaccine is being falsely touted as a cure-all to end the spread of the virus and that’s really not the case…and I’m vaccinated.
9652,"They're also moving back behind closed doors to fans due to the latest outbreak, so that's not an argument for holding Oktoberfest IMO, which is the original context of the discussion."
9653,"For some it’s anxiety, but for others I think it’s tiredness."
9654,In particular being tired of change.
9655,Emotionally we’ve been through a lot this year.
9656,Personally I have very little fear of COVID; I’m only concerned about spreading it.
9657,"But I haven’t got the energy or enthusiasm to try to organise social events, which may or may not happen, and require much more work than before."
9658,I think by the end of the year life will be mostly normal.
9659,Many will have been vaccinated and the others will have either gotten sick with covid or are a symptomatic.
9660,But covid will always be here and you’ll most likely need to be revaccinated.
9661,Hopefully the severity of covid will diminish to the point that it becomes like the common cold.
9662,Also let’s hope that there aren’t any new viruses that pop up in the near future.
9663,How has nobody tried to stop this in a court?
9664,The justifications for this restriction are not given anymore.
9665,Would it help to just close your eyes before the nurse even takes out the needle?
9666,"It's over pretty quick, they just inject the vaccine into a fatty part of your arm, not like they're trying to find a vein to draw blood."
9667,Based on what article or announcement?
9668,I’ve commented to other users with the same phobia and they came back and said it was actually less scary than they had anticipated after they got the shot.
9669,The needle is tiny and you won’t feel it.
9670,"Turn away and relax your arm, it’ll be over in a half a second."
9671,What if we have to go through them again anyway with a variant?
9672,Won't you regret we were so cautious all to achieve nothing?
9673,They’re fat
9674,Most of the people I know that are refusing because it doesn't have full FDA approval likely won't get it once it does.
9675,They're using it as an excuse right now because it's a talking point from the anti-vaxx crowd.
9676,"I'm sure that's not true for everyone, but among the people I know it's absolutely the case."
9677,It doesn't matter what any scientist or government leader would say.
9678,"I'm not one of the ""nEw nOrMaL"" nutters, but fully reopen should be reserved to mean no COVID restrictions at ALL businesses/events."
9679,Yea what about the small businesses who can’t really afford to implement those systems?
9680,Keep them at reduced capacity?
9681,Cost is not the reason production is limited.
9682,Most of the IP costs are waved or very small anyway.
9683,It’s production know how and raw material limits.
9684,They are not the same vaccine.
9685,"In America there were 3 deaths out of 8 million doses, and that was before anybody knew about the side effects and could treat them effectively."
9686,"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ5DavuOkcM

A complete opinion piece with actually no evidence."
9687,"They have Bill Gates' interview with Sky, the same I've quoted above, but they don't actually disagree with anything he said, choosing instead to use blanket statements that he doesn't want to give away the IP when clearly it's not about the IP

Then they give an example of _one_ factory in Bangladesh with ""shiny new equipment from Germany"" that is waiting for licence to manufacture vaccines."
9688,"But absolutely nothing about what Bill Gates' said - the quality control, the expertise, the infrastructure."
9689,"Absolutely nothing

Then they talk about Bill Gates' links with pharma."
9690,"No shit Sherlock, he's working with global vaccination and healthcare programmes for decades, of course he has industry links."
9691,"Give me evidence that these links are being used to kill people, or harm people or whatever they actually wanted to claim here

And then the other dude, he starts speculating about the malaria vaccine without actual evidence of it being blocked by IP, or the global warming research initiative talking about global consensus on its deployment when in fact the technology is being developed and not being deployed at the moment

Tl;dr they're were grasping at straws to complain about, especially since they did not have an actual rebuttal to Bill Gates' points

."
9692,"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXWhMwixtws

Has nothing to do with Bill Gates."
9693,"Talks about the IP problem and companies not giving IP, whereas Bill Gates' point was that it's not the IP but infrastructure and quality control which is the problem

."
9694,"And here's the kicker, India developed its own vaccine called Covaxin, while it's also producing some vaccines under license."
9695,"If infrastructure has nothing to do with it and IP is the only issue, why is India suffering the worst case of the current pandemic?"
9696,How has the IP block stopped India from producing its own vaccine and the ones it is already producing under licence?
9697,[Its estimated that 7 million Americans won't get the vaccine because they don't know it's free](https://fortune.com/2021/03/10/covid-vaccine-free-people-not-getting-coronavirus-vaccines-cost-price/).

9706,"I have the extreme panic type of fear, not the fainting kind."
9707,This.
9708,"Business are going to accept everyone, regardless of whether they are vaccinated or not."
9709,We’re getting to a point where COVID isn’t going to hold people back from doing things anymore.
9710,"If you’re afraid of COVID, you’re most likely going to get vaccinated, if you’re not afraid of COVID, than no amount of precautions is going to entice you to go somewhere."
9711,"On the contrary, if you’re not vaccinated and have no intentions of being vaccinated, you’re probably more likely to want to go to a place that doesn’t care, than a place that has over the top precautions."
9712,"OP is right, the free market will decide this."
9713,But I don’t think it’s going to be the outcome they think it is.
9714,"I came down with COVID in February -- so far it appears I was one of the lucky ones that didn't have severe or long-term symptoms, but despite having ""immunity"" I'm still really nervous about going to malls, stores and restaurants."
9715,"Reinfection is possible, especially with the variants going around, so COVID still freaks me out."
9716,"Getting my first vaccine dose in a couple of weeks, maybe by two weeks after the second dose I'll be a bit more relaxed about going out."
9717,"Listen, if you don’t want to get the vaccine, then don’t."
9718,But don’t come crying to me if you’re on your death bed in a hospital begging for mercy.
9719,You have the choice to do what you want.
9720,Being stupid is a choice and I’ll be happy to continue my life being fully vaccinated as of two weeks ago.

9728,Chemotherapy broadly suppresses the immune system because immune cells rapidly divide like cancer cells.
9729,The fact that cancer patients aren't developing robust immunity isn't surprising to the medical community and is why we need to reach herd immunity.
9730,"62% of NJ adults have the first dose, most will have had their second by then"
9731,"I don't know the exact numbers for J&amp;J, but if it's similar to Astrazeneca, 5 out of barely 100.000 died due to AZ in Norway."
9732,"It's safe to assume that if we continue the vaccine even more people are going to die as a result of vaccinations, making it much more than 28 deaths total, especially for a one dose vaccine like J&amp;J and especially in Denmark since we have enough to vaccinate our entire population."
9733,"Dude, it boggles my mind sometimes how much he can pack away"
9734,&gt; Thanks for proving my point.
9735,"Yeah, I totally proved your point by pointing out that none of your ""skepticism"" had any logic behind it when you refused to answer every single ""why"" I gave."
9736,"&gt;It's not good enough that people do the things they're asked to do, they need to think the way they're told to think as well."

9739,"I believe the official study wraps up this summer with data available in August, but the one I’m thinking of contains adult data."
9740,It wasn’t centered on pediatric outcomes.
9741,Four months is not a long extension.
9742,"The airline world operates based on quarters, and most leisure travel is booked more than 60 days in advance."
9743,This extension is through the next quarter.
9744,"Changing midstream has significant logistical challenges for airlines, and it affects people who used the existence of a mandate to decide whether or not they want to travel this summer."
9745,The assertion that someone is going to decide to not get vaccinated because the mask mandate on airplanes might be lifted in August and not July is patently absurd.

9757,&gt; If I can require shirts and shoes and masks I can require proof of vaccinations.
9758,You're well within your rights to require this but how are you going to enforce it?
9759,You can't tell by looking at someone and the vaxx cards are literally just printed on card stock.

9801,"Vaccinating my daughter will not only increase her odds of surviving (or being less sick if they she gets covid), it will lessen the chance of me getting it, and also my parents."
9802,I am going to Miami next month and I assume that will be a nice vacation!
9803,Fair point - I thought that too at one point.
9804,"Hazard pay, and maybe a reduction for the home teachers."
9805,Money talks
9806,But we CAN wear masks forever - they're just a piece of cloth that doesn't really affect how you live.
9807,People will get tired of wearing them in the heat lol.
9808,And if there is almost no virus very few people will tolerate wearing them
9809,Because I haven't seen any numbers indicating what would actually change?
9810,"All the public statements speak in broad platitudes, meanwhile vaccines are already being manufactured in staggering numbers around the world."
9811,"It feels like folks are talking based on some idealized vision about how the world should work, not what would actually help."
9812,It's taking a hammer to a problem where a scalpel would work better.
9813,"Instead we should focus on voluntary/compulsory licensing deals (which will do better protecting trade secrets), cutting red tape on supply chains, and Covax generally (which is already well underway in helping supply vaccines to low income countries)."
9814,"Pass another stimulus, offer a thousand bucks a shot (twice as much for J&amp;J)."
9815,"Retroactive for anyone who already got vaccinated, of course."
9816,"Well, you probably realize this, but not only are deaths a lagging indicator, we should also be more interested in 7 day averages anyway."
9817,"FL and CA are both at 60, but CA has about 80% more population, so yeah CA is doing much better."
9818,And this will become a more dramatic difference as the states get through backlogs.

Two [national pharmacy chains](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/pharmacies-say-they-could-do-more-distribute-vaccines-states-are-n1254016) that the federal government entrusted to inoculate people against Covid-19 account for the lion's share of wasted vaccine doses, according to government data obtained by Kaiser Health News."
9820,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recorded 182,874 wasted doses as of late March, three months into the country's effort to vaccinate the masses against the coronavirus."
9821,"***CVS was responsible for nearly half, and Walgreens was responsible for 21 percent,*** or nearly 128,500 wasted shots combined."
9822,"CDC data suggest that the companies have wasted more doses than states, U.S. territories and federal agencies combined."
9823,"Pfizer's vaccine, which in December was the first to be deployed and initially required storage at ultracold temperatures, made up nearly 60 percent of the tossed doses."

9825,You need to be german or a resident in Germany (basically paying or being in the German Healthcare system).
9826,Otherwise it would be pretty stupid
9827,Why should we get rid of masks?
9828,They're literally a piece of cloth that save tons of lives.
9829,"Its a year off of a large event, not the end of the world."
9830,And more good news: This week and next week should see another increase in doses due to an increase in deliveries of 1M per week compared to last week.
9831,I don’t see how lifting the IP ban will fix things in India.
9832,"It may allow other countries to create vaccines, but India literally has its own vaccine they can use."
9833,They don’t have the supplies and haven’t ramped up production enough.
9834,You know what comes next?
9835,"A lot of people who've been vaccinated saying ""screw it, I'm going back to normal, if the antivaxxers catch covid and die then I won't be shedding a tear."""
9836,"Yes, we know that there is collateral damage when this happens."
9837,But I see a lot of discussion going this way already.
9838,People are tired of the antivaxxers slowing down the end of the pandemic.
9839,Because they keep trying to live in a 0 covid fantasy world that cannot exist anymore.
9840,"Even if 100% of the population was vaccinated not all infections will be stopped, they will always pop back up from the numerous wild animals that have been infected or from imported cases."

9849,It's getting insane at this point.
9850,"My 1 year old daughter just completed chemo treatment and she isn’t able to get any childhood vaccines for 6 months because this is a known phenomenon with all vaccines, not just covid."
9851,It’s a giant failure for kids.
9852,"Also by making school this unappealing, no one goes, then the unions can say no one wants to be in person."
9853,So let’s do online again this fall!
9854,I’m up in portland with “like minds” as California and 85% of the kids at our schools chose to go back to hybrid.
9855,Which is still a joke and only a few hours a week but at least it’s with their teachers and actual connection and not sitting on chrome books.
9856,Even the very low income schools are 50/50 and I suspect a lot of that is bc it’s a working parents nightmare
9857,"Its wild at how much outrage and difficulty has happened over the past year because some people never considered ""punt this until next year, safer than sorry"" to be an option."

9861,"I trust that the coronavirus vaccines have undergone due diligence in review by the local health authorities (FDA in the USA), and if I had a child, I would not hesitate to get them vaccinated per recommendations."
9862,Combination of underrated and super strict lockdowns
9863,&gt; 710k are fully vaccinated and 1663k doses have been administered.
9864,"No, assuming that each of those 710k fully vaccinated were done with a two-dose vaccine (as a vast majority have), then 1420k doses were administered just for them."
9865,That leaves only 243k people still waiting second dose.
9866,Since mRNA vaccines usually result in high amount of antibodies the other vaccines will probably perform worse.

9873,"I am going to protect my kids as best I can — and protect their friends, and my parents, and that's why I'm going to vaccinate my 12-year-old at the earliest possible moment."
9874,Theres a difference between not encouraging anti vax discourse and actively creating it.
9875,"If the government halts the J&amp;J vaccine and the media runs with the headlines that ""this vaccine is too dangerous to use"" that isn't pandering to anti vaxxer conspiracy theories, that's major news outlets openly saying the vaccine can't be trusted."
9876,"That it was just a temporary halt based on six cases out of millions is kind of irrelevant, the news cycle has already done the damage."
9877,It's way more damaging and way more persuasive to unsure people than your post is making it out to be.
9878,I would have hesitated to get my shot if this news had broken before my appointment and I don't think I'm crazy or irrational.

9887,"Curiously, with covid raging in india, increasing in Pakistan, nepal and thailand, China isnt reporting any increases in infections (at 10 or so a day) and no new deaths."
9888,What is their secret?
9889,"I honestly want them to be optional, me and my 6 year old have developed dermatitis around the mouth thanks to them, while I understand the “they don’t bother me” crowd just because something doesn’t bother YOU doesn’t mean is should be mandatory for everyone."
9890,"Well, most public teachers were already unhappy with their salary before so of course if given the option to teach from home, they'll take that option."
9891,The best way to encourage teachers to teach from school is to add a raise stipulation if they're fully vaccinated and have to teach from school.
9892,I think a lot of people have developed some mild mental issue of some kind from this.

9915,Dallas did not really get hard by covid though.
9916,When the dust settles it was/will be seen as one of the better if not the best large cities overall.
9917,"A lot of people lump Dallas in with ""Texas"" when ignoring that the biggest issue in Texas was RGV and El Paso."

9919,"The real question is, do you care if others don’t wear masks?"
9920,I don’t think anyone cares if someone wears a mask around them.

9922,Is that faction normally significant?
9923,It's called Pfizer
9924,Not within a few weeks.

9935,Anyone know when we may have 2 year old's covered?
9936,Yeah but you can't cater everything to some kind of meta to not fuel anti-vax.
9937,Trying to control the message to match some kind of discourse meta looks about as silly as anti-vax logic and will just lead to people grandstanding.
9938,"On average there will be like 10% of any population that has an IQ below 85 and that's not even counting people who subscribe to various religous/ideological influence rather than reason but that doesn't mean everyone else should dumb everything down to cater to them

And if people really have concerns you engage in constructive discussion (or ignore it), you don't try to manipulate them with shame, that's just low"
9939,I see your point.
9940,But my interpretation is that they do still believe we will reach herd immunity in September but don't want to immediately stress test that belief by concentrating 6 million people in a square kilometer.
9941,That not super pessimistic to me but maybe I'm a Maß half full kinda guy!
9942,"Of course they will matter, the more the merrier."
9943,In fact Curevac can be stored at regular temperatures so could be helpful in some situations to have a mRNA vaccine with that option.
9944,"A ton of the shots in IL were not reported (Walgreens, CVS, albertsons, all delayed)."
9945,They made a statement on the press briefing today.
9946,Keep optimistic!!
9947,Edit: wrong pharmacy
9948,"A vaccine that is using new technology, developed in record time, in which the companies producing them have full immunity."
9949,Criminal companies.
9950,"Pfizer has paid BILLIONS in fines for criminal activity, including bribing scientists and doctors, lying about safety of medicines, and experimenting on children without their parents knowledge and consent."
9951,"So to be fair, we arent sure whether these vaccines will have terrible consequences for children long term right?"
9952,It floors me that California so darn slow to get back to real teaching!
9953,The teachers union doesn’t have a vested interest in the kids.
9954,Kids all over the country are in school in person.
9955,My son’s high school in a different state hasn’t had a covid case since mid April.
9956,They have normal classes and regular teaching.
9957,The reality is this is unfortunate.
9958,But there are really two scenarios in this world... Countries that are using Pfizer and countries that are not.
9959,That is the only relevant factor right now
9960,Because people don't understand how safe they actually are by being vaccinated because the CDC has been understating the benefits
9961,Any word on when we'll see availability for under 12?
9962,Containing it has nothing to do with where it originated from.
9963,Other countries have done the same.
9964,90 days seems outdated now.
9965,"I think the medical community is treating it as a 90-day window, but more studies are showing longer periods of immunity."

9994,My wife teaches hybrid middle school science and her experience is the distance learning students get a short shrift.
9995,Kids in person naturally draw most of her attention and she has to make a constant effort to engage the kids on the computer.
9996,It’s also harder for them to get her attention if they have a question.
9997,Not to mention half the distance kids don’t log in for class at all and half of those that do don’t turn their cameras on or engage in any way.
9998,Without a chaperone looking over their shoulders all day long there’s no one to enforce attendance or attention.
9999,"Functionally, for most families, distance learning is a subpar teaching experience *especially* if it’s hybrid."
10000,This is amazing news.
10001,Vaccinating those 16+ did a lot to dramatically lower Covid spread but we were never going to be able to entirely beat Covid by just vaccinating people 16 and over.
10002,Currently our Covid rates in the US are similar to what they were in early October but once we start vaccinating those 12+ I would expect that number to drop back down to August and early September levels which would be a big improvement.
10003,One dose isn't really enough to make sure that we don't have outbreaks.
10004,2 is needed.
10005,"The way you speak with such authority, when you *clearly* have absolutely **zero** expertise on this subject, is truly hysterical."
10006,You wouldn't get so many downvotes if you made your uninformed comments with a *little bit* of humility.
10007,"You have no point of reference for if 50k+ new covid cases ""isn't great""."
10008,"You have no idea if ""next winter will suck""."

10016,So far none of the variants are proven to escape vaccines.
10017,"The COVID19 virus can only mutate to an extent, there is a ceiling (based on time) from what I understand, so the mutations that are cropping up commonly around the world are because it makes the virus more successful."
10018,"These mutations that allow it to spread quicker are not escaping vaccines, and evolution works one way, they won't magically revert back."
10019,Highly unlikely that at this stage that a mutation will be enough to get past vaccines - we would know by now.
10020,"If a variant did escape vaccines in all odds it wouldn't be some super spreading version and wouldn't totally escape either, thus would die out quick."

10087,"Vaccine passports are sensitive in the UK at the moment because not all of the population have access to vaccines (the UK rollout is being done relatively strictly by age and clinical need, and this has not reached the under 40’s yet)."

from the article:

&gt; On April 15, at a hearing on the coronavirus pandemic, Rep. Jim Jordan harangued Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases."
10100,"Jordan, an outspoken critic of mask mandates, demanded to know when Americans would “get their liberties back and be able to move on with their lives.” Fauci explained that the answer depended on progress in vaccination, which in turn depended on how many people were willing to roll up their sleeves."
10101,"Jordan, who had passed up an invitation to get vaccinated in December—and had reiterated in March that he was in “no hurry” to get his shot—ignored Fauci’s point and went on with his tirade."
10102,"&gt; This is the paradox we’re dealing with as we try to get control of the virus: People who won’t get vaccinated—in many cases, the same people who defy mask orders and other public health measures—are holding us back from resuming normal life."
10103,Many of them are deliberate freeloaders.
10104,"They’re counting on the rest of us to suppress the pandemic—and thereby protect them—by getting vaccinated, while they refuse to do the same."

10155,"“The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recorded 182,874 wasted doses as of late March, three months into the country’s effort to vaccinate the masses against the coronavirus."
10156,"Of those, CVS was responsible for nearly half, and Walgreens for 21%, or nearly 128,500 wasted shots combined.”

Parse it how you are want those numbers aren’t great considering the level of demand through March."
10157,It’s a foot note in the grand scheme of things.
10158,But given how many shoe string operations there were going in the country to start the relative level of wastage at two established providers is still notable.

10164,Provinces have a wide latitude to do what they want.

10179,This is the problem with media currently.
10180,This article is an opinion piece disguised as news which is actually misinforming the public and potentially creating unnecessary fear and anxiety.
10181,"The message is that unnamed experts now think the pandemic is hopeless, click here for more!"
10182,This type of shenanigan is why we need to regulate the hell out of media.
10183,Label laws at the very least.
10184,Is this a fact?
10185,No?
10186,"Okay put a big red label on top in bold letters that says ""OPINION""."
10187,This is fact?
10188,"Then say ""VERIFIED FACT""."
10189,Failure to comply should put the media company out of business.
10190,"In Canada the current “trick” is flying through another country and waiting the 14 days/getting a test in the connecting country, since the problem stemmed from COVID positive people arriving with “negative” tests that were either incorrect or faked (not necessarily the traveller’s fault, could be lab issue, but it was happening far too much)."
10191,"I’m sympathetic but the situation in India has been deteriorating for some time, they’ve discouraged travel for a year+ now, and it isn’t a permanent ban, just a pause since so many flights with sick people kept arriving every day."
10192,The people who choose to get the vaccine are not making a random choice.
10193,Suppose (to make the numbers easy) you have 50% of the country get a disease and 50% vaccinate.
10194,If it is a *random* 50% that vaccinate you have 75% of the public either vaccinated (50ppt) or have experienced the disease (50% of 50% =  another 25ppt).
10195,But the choice to vaccinate isn't random.
10196,"We know:

- People who have had COVID are *more likely* to want the vaccine."
10197,"- Ditto for people who have household members who had COVID

=&gt; It is more likely that there is a high overlap between those who are vaccinated and those who had COVID."
10198,I think there is also going to be a decent spike in the number of 18-25s getting their shots in the next couple weeks once finals are over - I know a few who were hesitant to get it last month because it would put potential 2nd dose side effects right at the end of the semester as they are working nonstop on finals and finishing term projects.

10203,"I think the author does a good job of delivering bad news in an objective, rational manner."
10204,"Because the reality is that we DO have wide swaths of this country and entire states struggling to get 25% or 30% of their population vaccinated, with nobody lining up to get the shots and day after day of empty vaccination appointments."
10205,Do you want somebody to lie to you and tell you that herd immunity is possible in such an environment?
10206,"It's a sobering reality, but the author delivers it in a way that isn't alarmist at all."
10207,"Calling something ""manageable with small numbers of hospitalizaitons and deaths"" is a really bad job at being alarmist."
10208,I mean the US was the worst in the world for a long time... we needed to get our shit together before sending vaccines abroad.
10209,people love to hate america when we meddle other places but then get mad when we develop tools like the vaccine and dont share.
10210,Whoop!
10211,My oldest will be 16 in July and I was waiting to see if this would happen first.

10214,"With Canada and Mexico finally having access to vaccines produced in the U.S. and the states essentially all hitting vaccination rate walls, I'm wondering if I can tease an idea out of the data of when we might see a surplus arrive in Canada."

10216,"Next week, the U.S. has 100million un-administered doses, is averaging under 2 million vaccinations a day, and produces 50 million Pfizer/Moderna a week, then my gut is telling me they'll be all 'um Canada/Mexico?"

10243,Moderna was 2.
10244,The CDC just says 2 after second dose to keep messaging simple.

10346,"I think it's easy to forget late last year and early this year, how bad everyone thought the roll out was going to be."
10347,"Most media, said we'd be lucky to even get 100m shots for Americans."
10348,Everyone wanted everything rushed.
10349,The US pretty much shipped those doses to CVS and Walgreens late last year and said get those shots out.
10350,"So they had to initially roll that out on their own, against no nationwide plan."
10351,"Vaccination sites took a bit time to get up and running, when they did, there was a lot of confusion and difficulty booking."
10352,I would guess to say that caused a lot of doses to wait around.
10353,"I remember reading how doses had to be thrown away because it sat too long, or some places found out they had inadequate cooling."
10354,"I am guessing again, they played by the book and just threw out doses after a certain criteria of waiting or not being refrigerated."
10355,This was also against the backdrop of Americans being tired of lock downs and was already going to force their way back to normal.
10356,Speed of vaccination was essentially critical.
10357,"When everything is said and done, I am sure there will be a lot more waste to be found."
10358,Just look at the 15 million doses from JJ for that bad Baltimore plant.
10359,"But at the pace the US wanted, and where it is now, in my opinion, at least for the US, is that waste surprising?"
10360,No.
10361,"Sputnik would only be bought if approved by EMA, who still says they are waiting for all necessary data to start the process, and it was just denied approval in Brazil."
10362,I seriously doubt there is a reasonable chance for it being approved by the EU.
10363,And with the time table by the time Germany would get the first 10m doses we really shouldn't need it anymore.
10364,Either people are being reinfected at a higher rate than the baseline or they’re not.
10365,This is not a hard thing to monitor for.
10366,"And regardless, Brazilian sources are unanimous in noting that it’s not vaccinated people in the hospitals, much less the ICU wards."
10367,Not sure why my last comment got deleted but I hope it works out for us all.
10368,Ready for this to be over and for our babies to be safe.
10369,"Think they’re looking for any excuse not to do it, unfortunately."
10370,Hopefully 12-15 kids will be able to be vaccinated soon that should be a big boom in numbers.
10371,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/china-travel-covid-19/index.html
10372,Yeah.
10373,But that is what it is at the moment.
10374,Nothing said here is going to change the minds of people who currently don’t want the vaccination except perhaps appeals from their friends and families.
10375,And time...time will help.
10376,"When the full FDA approval comes through, and more and more people see no real dangerous side effects, and a Covid vac becomes a routine part of a physical some more people will get it."
10377,"The big thing is though that we’ve gotten lots better at treating Covid, and hopefully fatalities and long Covid will become increasingly rare in the future as the hospitals won’t be overwhelmed and we are getting better at keeping people from getting sick enough while in the hospital to require ventilation."
10378,That’s a good point.
10379,[deleted]
10380,"Yes I intend to even though I’m at lowest risk to others and to myself (minimal social contact, P100 mask+face shield, vaccinated family members)."
10381,"I'm so excited about this, but at the same time sad/confused about why they set the minimum age to 12."
10382,"I've got a 12 year old and an 11 year old, we will get the 12 year old vaccinated but wish I had some kind of timeline on when we might be able to get our 11 year old vaxxed!"
10383,Hoping we can get it done before her birthday in February.

10385,What inferiority?
10386,I went to an outdoor gathering this weekend for my parents retirement.
10387,"I'm typically very cautious, but didn't wear a mask as many were vaccinated."
10388,However some middle school kids were talking with my 2yo son for a bit.
10389,"Should we all quarantine just as a precaution, just in case someone there tests positive?"

10394,It stinks that the US and European companies are claiming this is just not feasible.
10395,This is the good news we've been waiting for!
10396,"My wife and my two oldest kids are fully vaccinated now, and my second shot is this Thursday."
10397,"My youngest is 15, turning 16 in July, so it will be nice if she can ""join us"" before then."
10398,"Like I mentioned in my initial post, I am also in the camp that the US is unlikely to reach herd immunity."
10399,"My point is that the article is clearly crafted to support the notion that we will need to get there to get our livelihoods back, which is far too pessimistic."
10400,"I think an objective article would have included things like how far cases have fallen in places like the Israel and UK, where vaccination rates also remain below the consensus level required to reach herd immunity, projections from people like Gottlieb that cases may fall to 10,000 per day this summer, or an acknowledgement that our total protection rate (vaccinated + previously infected individuals) is already north of 60%."
10401,Then let them?
10402,Idk I imagine a lot of them will be sad seeing all the fun vaccinated people get up to.
10403,A lot of people will want to go to concerts.
10404,The problem is that the people affected by the issue with the vaccine are the people with low chances of dying or being severely affected by the disease.
10405,"Yes, it’s a tiny chance, but it’s still a dilemma when there are vaccines that seem not to cause the clotting issue available."
10406,I think it’s probably better to let younger people decide to take it but I can understand a government deciding otherwise.
10407,"If countries decide not to use AZ or JJ I hope they can quickly be approved and sent to countries that WILL use them, especially for older folks who are both more vulnerable to COVID and apparently even less likely to have a chance of a clotting issue."
10408," Patents are not inalienable rights, they are bestowed by society/government in order to grant monopolies which would encourage innovation."
10409,We the public grant them in order to benefit the public.
10410,The intent is innovation.
10411,"The pendulum has been continuously swinging too far, however."
10412,"Instead of research and development with scientists and statisticians, we now have loophole finder lawyers and marketers."
10413,We're now at WWI trench warfare of pharma.
10414,"There's a lot of spending being done, a lot of damage being done, but no progress being made."
10415,The activities of regulatory pathway manipulations are failing to move medicine forward.
10416,It's subverting the intention of the patent system in the first place.
10417,It's blocking innovation and better drugs.
10418,The balance of public good and private incentive is now fully depressed rather than evenly weighted.
10419,We also can’t forget that there’s been billions of dollars of public money going into these vaccines.
10420,Decades of funded research.
10421,Where is the public’s ROI for financial stake in this?

10429,"I totally agree, and have been repeatedly attacked for bringing up this point."
10430,"The ""wait and see"" people aren't experts--when more data comes in, they aren't going to be in a particularly good position to analyze it anyway!"
10431,The experts--who have actually analyzed the huge amount of existing data--universally say to take the vaccine today.

10443,It's always hot and sunny in the major population centers and they are getting destroyed with new Covid cases.
10444,I'd imagine the US would be seeing a huge spike as well if we didn't have so many people vaccinated at this point.
10445,I like how you didn’t have an answer
10446,I entirely agree.
10447,None of this it's my body so I will do what I want crap!

10452,The bus ride to school is more dangerous for children than Covid by a long shot
10453,why?
10454,If a way to effectively reuse masks can be created why would you want to create so many masks?

10474,"https://youtu.be/tropM4cajFw


But the research is pretty clear that RnD is not going to be effected by this."
10475,It’s just a conservative talking point supposition which for some reason get treated with far too much seriousness.
10476,"Well, you win this one."
10477,In my defence that analysis is fairly new and there are potentially other ways to explain it.
10478,Why are they so dramatic lmao
10479,"A couple years ago, he did a little audiobook for Audible about the weather and weather forecasting that I found super fascinating and informative."
10480,I'm always reminded of it when I see Twister is on TV because I recall a bit in the audiobook about how that movie had a big influence on getting some kids interested in studying meteorology.
10481,"I was wondering if Lewis might end up doing a book about WallStreetBets and GameStop, since he does like to return now and then to the financial world of his youth."
10482,But that’s not happening now tho?
10483,It's not only about dying from covid...
10484,I don't want to lose my smell for 6 months or get asthma or heart conditions... And those aren't things that only happen to 85+ age group they happen to everyone...
10485,So yes getting the vaccine and not having those symptoms is a good thing.
10486,The clinical trial data focused on two weeks post 2nd vaccine.
10487,"So, two weeks to be considered ""fully vaccinated."""
10488,"This isn't the argument, though."
10489,The idea is that *any* coronavirus would be about as deadly as covid to adults who have never caught that coronavirus.
10490,"However, since we all catch virtually every coronavirus as kids, our immune systems learn to fight them and we get less sick as adults."
10491,"[This](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/turning-the-covid-19-pandemic-into-the-covid-19-endemic/) fivethirtyeight podcast discusses this theory, and brings up the theory that the [""Russian flu""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1889%E2%80%931890_pandemic) pandemic of 1890 was actually the introduction of the coronavrius OC43, which is now just a common cold."
10492,"I am neither an expert nor endorsing this theory, but it is very different from your suggestion that the virus itself will mutate to be less deadly."
10493,Your link proves my point.
10494,They saw problems right away and shut it down.
10495,Show me any vaccine that had long term effects show up after 2 weeks time.
10496,"And yes, there is plenty of evidence that getting vaccinated stops you from being able to catch it."
10497,That’s the whole point of the vaccine.
10498,Obviously all the data isn’t in yet but all signs point to this.
10499,Show me otherwise.
10500,Or what your point is?
10501,Not vaccinating a child is selfish shit.
10502,Do your part to keep your kid and other people safe.
10503,"Seems like the EU has learned its lesson, and is only making deals if the production capacity is in place."
10504,Pretty sure PPE is in oversupply at this point.
10505,"OK, now I see your point."
10506,I don't necessarily disagree with you.
10507,"But I'm trying to address the inevitable ""but..."" responses to vaccine passports."
10508,Death isn't everything.
10509,"Losing your smell, asthma, heart problems... Those exist also."
10510,I think this is great news.
10511,For a variety of reasons.
10512,"I know that age range doesn't ( as a rule ) get as severe reactions to the virus as older people, but I'd still feel better with children that age having the ability to get it."
10513,I only had dead arm as well
10514,"With the very, very obviously huge caveat that I am not a doctor or medical professional, but *have* had a blood clot in my leg before (while recovering from surgery to repair a torn muscle), the advice given to me by doctors was to always keep the leg elevated, use a heating pad, and wear compression stockings."
10515,I'd go to an urgent care center to have it looked at as soon as he can financially justify it.
10516,The only thing I've ever experienced that I'd liken to feeling like I'd been shot was having a staph infection.
10517,Yeah that's possible.
10518,But it's equally possible that it's not effectively 1 as not every nation reports on a bank holiday.
10519,"i swear, these types of articles make the double masks after vaccination types even more smug."
10520,"We're going to have people bragging they sat inside all summer in a dark room and how virtuous they are because reaching herd immunity is ""impossible"""
10521,Remember that Broadway isn't opening until September.
10522,"There’s a difference between insurance companies rewarding their customers for being healthy/whatever and effectively penalizing them for being sick (in this case, not being vaccinated is sick)."
10523,I’m just telling you the law that’s on the books.
10524,Analogies aren't perfect.
10525,The point is that you don't need perfect understanding of something to use it safely and effectively.
10526,You don't need to understand chemistry to know not to throw water on a grease fire.
10527,You just need to see it once.
10528,We've been making vaccines for a while now.
10529,We may not be chemists but we've got lots of experienced cooks.
10530,"Yes, 200 000 a couple of weeks ago."
10531,Was used for 65+.
10532,You should take a test.
10533,"The vaccine itself will be fine, but (particularly if it's the first shot) is likely not fully protective quite yet so you will want to know if you have covid from this exposure so you can isolate appropriately."
10534,Where did you read that?
10535,It’s not in the article and no one has mentioned vaccine passports for Oktoberfest.
10536,Many European countries are allowing travel for unvaccinated people and most are re-opening around May 15.
10537,I am so happy.
10538,All in my family have had their first BNT shots.
10539,I am fully vaccinated since a few days.
10540,My county has 39% of eligibles covered with first shots.
10541,TIL 12 year olds can't think for themselves and have no idea what their friends or anybody outside of their family is doing
10542,Would be interesting to see how much of this is attributable to people who already had the virus not seeking vaccines.
10543,Non-white groups were disproportionately infected.

10550,We ain’t gonna use all AZ we ordered (only used for 65+ and most of them are vaccinated with 1 dose).
10551,"So someone should use em, I disagree with the reason not to use em for people under 65, but it is what it is."
10552,That is the minimum.
10553,Not the maximum.
10554,Do you have a link for any of those cellular studies?
10555,The real world data is a prime example of why uncontrolled data can give misleading results.
10556,"In the UK for instance, those getting pfizer shots had a 1.7x risk ratio vs those getting AZ shots *before* they got the shots."
10557,"The pfizer shots were mostly given healthcare workers at the start of a surge, while the AZ shots were given to group care and elderly residents."
10558,After the first shot  the risk ratio for the healthcare workers (again during the surge) rose to even more than 1.7x that of the (now surrounded by vaccinated people) group care residents.
10559,"The trial data does not have these confounding factors, and is quite clear that mRNA vaccines are substantially better at reducing symptoms and infections than AZ."
10560,Nope.
10561,"Saxony, Bavaria and Berlin."
10562,They failed to incentivice the older population to get AZ by giving them not earlier vaccination appointments.
10563,"Now they are receiving the doses and have to try to get them to the general population contrary to the PEI recommondation, which might be more difficult."
10564,"Additionally, they will fall further behind because the vaccination regime for the second dose with AZ is longer than with Pfizer."
10565,So they lag behind twice in the next weeks.
10566,"Apart from the disorderly distribution, which will now see people vaccinated who aren't unhealthy or who aren't at risk because of their workplace like food retail and so on, which will result in higher infection rates and unnecessary deaths."

10627,(eye roll)
10628,There's also a huge mistrust of the medical establishment.
10629,It's more complicated than that.
10630,"Of the 100% confirmed reinfections (sequencing showing that it is a different infection rather than remnants of the first), a decent chunk of them are worse the second time, up to and including deaths."
10631,Compared to what?
10632,Because not getting Covid 19 has a way way way way higher survival rate.
10633,Yes!
10634,Yesterday the side effects knocked me down for good hahaha but now I'm feeling great.
10635,Doesn’t say.
10636,Nepal doesn’t have much of a vaccine program so it’s not relevant.
10637,"&gt;Nepal began a vaccination campaign in January with 1 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine donated by India, but this was suspended because of India's refusal to allow exports as its domestic situation worsened."
10638,"&gt;Nepal has also paid for an additional 1 million doses from India, but has been waiting for the delivery since March."
10639,&gt;This shipment is needed for elderly people scheduled for a second dose in May.
10640,"&gt;The campaign was resumed with 800,000 vaccine doses donated by China, and now Nepal is negotiating with Russian authorities for supplies of Russian vaccines."
10641,Incredible news.
10642,"Let’s hope other countries follow suit within weeks; been waiting to see what would happen to Israel if they ramped up vaccines again to another age group, as they’ve pretty much tapped out most adults that want a shot."
10643,"Once COVID is limited through schools, there’s really nowhere left to go."
10644,"Ugh, it’s such a challenge just to exist at that age."
10645,Wishing you both all the best.
10646,It's barbaric to send patients away when you think they're symptoms are all in their head.
10647,"Even if that's true, the brain can create pain that's just as real as any pain."
10648,Some of us have friends and family who refuse to get the covid vaccine.
10649,How are we supposed to navigate being vaccinated but having to be around unvaccinated high risk people?
10650,Is it our fault if we accidentally get them sick since they’re unprotected?
10651,There has been no long term studies on mRNA vaccines.
10652,"No traditional vaccine has any long term effects but mRNA vaccines have not had long term studies

Please let me know if this is wrong and I will correct myself"
10653,[removed]
10654,Approve as in full approval or just emergency approval like we have for adults?
10655,"Sure, if you’re going to focus credit on regulatory and logistical hurdles, Pfizer also received massive amounts of help from numerous governmental agencies."
10656,Despite them continuously only liking to tout that they didn’t receive “direct” payments.
10657,https://youtu.be/JCaELIRkyBM
10658,this just isn’t true lmao
10659,Mind equals blown!
10660,"Last time I checked Nepal also didn't have universal plumbing, now this was probably close to 15 years ago."
10661,"It's just such a poor in backwards country, well I'm glad it's modernized a bit."
10662,Stay safe.
10663,Yep.
10664,Totally locked him inside.
10665,Just threw a box of cereal at him once a week and a bottle of water.
10666,"Maybe let's just open the IP up so other countries can know how to produce the vaccine (not just the patent itself, but how to manufacture at scale), that way we get more humans vaccinated."
10667,"The only downside will be a few rich dudes make less money, and honestly who gives AF?"
10668,"&gt; Its picking up speed now 

Well, that's good to hear at least."
10669,"Likely played a part, but a week ago it was only 6 so either way the trends are all going in the right direction."

10671,"I've had possible exposure to covid since last week and just now found out, three days after my vaccine, should I take a test??"
10672,I'm scared the vaccine is gonna be messed up now
10673,It’s fine.
10674,"I have a feeling most people are okay with it, our situation is under control right now, and we are slowly opening up most things, with restaurants and bars opening two weeks ago with certain restrictions."
10675,"The expectation is that AZ and J&amp;J will be offered on a voluntary basis, for people that are okay with the risks."
10676,"Personally I’m in the very last group that will be offered the vaccines, so I’d be tempted to go for J&amp;J if that’s an option."
10677,I agree about leadership.
10678,"We have all seen what happens when the wrong people are in charge, case in point the past administration here."
10679,"It sure shows how important it is to place the best scientists and medical experts for the job in charge, and for leaders to urge people to heed them."
10680,And also we have all seen what lifting restrictions before enough people are vaccinated will do.
10681,I hope people took a lesson for the next inevitable pandemic but most probably haven't.
10682,We have excellent distribution we were just severely lacking vaccine.
10683,Its picking up speed now

10689,*
10690,I would argue that preventing COVID and such restrictions will be an ongoing challenge to freedom.
10691,The freedom that comes from partying after the epidemic has passed is different kind of freedom than from when partying and trusting that the diseases is kept away at the border.
10692,Last time it was this low was the 3rd of August last year.
10693,Most likely this figure is because of the bank holiday but this is still amazing compared to the peak of the second wave back in Jan/Feb.
10694,Parents made the right decision.
10695,Nice.
10696,"Good, no paper please for us"
10697,Have a lot of these people already had covid?
10698,"If so it’s less concerning, as natural immunity is almost as good."
10699,It's not an issue of supply it's an issue of IP.
10700,"If the IP is open, and the information of how to manufacture the vaccines is shared freely, much of the issue regarding vaccine access in poorer countries is solved."
10701,The problem is that we don't want to open the IP because that means someone else could be making money when a small group of rich people want to be making all the money.
10702,That's the problem.
10703,"It's colonialism, again, and it's going to get a bunch of us killed or debilitated as it lengthens the pandemic."
10704,Didn't we just have an outbreak like India?
10705,"Yeah, it's honestly kinda weird."
10706,"Youyang Gu changed his ""path to herd immunity"" page to ""path to normality"" in February."
10707,[Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/youyanggu/status/1364627872233750543) plus a [Bonus Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/youyanggu/status/1359941463757516802) from earlier in February where he said we wouldn't reach full herd immunity but that shouldn't be the end goal.
10708,The danish health authorities came to the opposite conclusion.
10709,Zero persons under 30 have died so far in Denmark with Covid and I think only two younger than 50 without co-mobidities.
10710,If Denmark continued vaccination with J&amp;J and AZ we would get at least a håndfuld deaths among young and otherwise healthy people.
10711,For young people in Denmark in the coming months the risk of getting covid is also very low
10712,You are exactly right.
10713,"This is like the parable of the little red hen, “ Who will help me pay the billions of dollars to keep expert staff and production facilities?“, not I said every government (except the US) demanding they sell pharmaceuticals at cost."

10723,My 13 year old daughter is the only one left in my family who isn't fully vaxxed
10724,My 15 year old has been counting down the days for this approval.
10725,"I have, too."
10726,"She has done well with virtual learning academically, but the lack of peer to peer interaction has been challenging."
10727,We stopped wiping off groceries but still try and use hand sanitizer after a public outing.
10728,That's more than the total population of the Netherlands
10729,Regardless of the technology it was astounding feat to run a successful trial and manufacture the vaccine in less than a year.
10730,Let’s not undermine and discount the logistical and administrative hurdles of Pfizer.
10731,They have plenty of time to get it.
10732,"In the UK they are waiting 12 weeks between shots, so let's see after at least that period how many people have not taken it."
10733,"Bank holiday numbers so its an anomaly, but it won't be long until these are our real numbers!"
10734,"Yes, that is true, which is why I said that the risk assessment is a lot more complicated than that."
10735,"But ""1/100,000 vs 1/100"" is straight up false."
10736,You and the comment you replied to were specifically talking about the risk of dying.
10737,They're fully opening Broadway but keeping outdoor capacity restrictions?
10738,Oh shit are you in Nepal?
10739,Do they have internet in Nepal?
10740,"I am also a young person with CF and was lucky enough to have gotten through having covid with minimal symptoms and am now fully vaccinated and never got any side effects, great to hear your family has been safe"
10741,Ok but they can just raise prices for “inflation” or some other imaginary fee and then add a wellness credit category for vaccines.
10742,"In fact, my current plan already has a wellness credit category for the covid vaccine."
10743,[removed]
10744,"How many people do you think will die of COVID because of slow global vaccination rates, driven by the callous desire to protect pharma profits?"
10745,Would you say it's more than 5000?
10746,[removed]
10747,"It’s probably true, but since the people dying/severely ill from clots probably aren’t the same demographics as the people dying/severely ill from COVID, it is something of an ethical quandary... and that kind of neurological event in a young person can be life-changing and also quite expensive for the health care system if they’re left permanently disabled at a young age."
10748,I don’t envy the public health people who have to do the math on that.

10763,My wife and I went out Friday night to a restaurant and ate inside for the first time since the pandemic started.
10764,It was great.
10765,She's going to the gym today.
10766,We're 100% back to normal.
10767,just started a rewatch of the series.
10768,its been a while.
10769,so fucking funny (watch this get removed by auto-mod)
10770,"Yeah, that's not a good PR combination."
10771,"Exactly, multiple weeks are enough."
10772,Additionally it should be conveyed that following this vaccines will only be available through monthly pre-orders or something similar.
10773,No point in doses getting spoilt in freezers
10774,"We currently have a 7mo at home, so news about being able to vaccinate her can't come soon enough."
10775,Apparently trials have just begun on 6mo and older.
10776,So hopefully we will have an answer soon.
10777,New Jersey is rolling back restrictions on capacity limits but maintaining the indoor mask mandate.
10778,"I guess there's just going to be this weird overlap period where people can go inside and eat maskless, but still need masks at restaurants and gyms."
10779,But I've got to imagine that won't last too long.
10780,"Foreign born population:

United States: 50.7 million 

New Zealand: 1.0 million

10800,Do all bodies need the same amount or is it just easier to make and distribute a one-size-put-into-the-bodies-of-all vaccine?

10802,I am going back to normal after 1 week.
10803,"I am using Pfizer, Isreal, and Australia's study to back me up."

10831,"We know this already, no?"
10832,It's about two thirds as effective as the two-dose regime.
10833,"Better than that if you look at deaths/serious cases, slightly worse if you look at mild/asymptomatic cases and transmission."
10834,But it's still quite decent.
10835,this is excellent news for ya'll!!!

10842,[removed]
10843,28% with a first dose.
10844,They're about 5 weeks behind the US and going at the same pace we were then.
10845,The stories about how slow Europe/Canada was at vaccination turned out to be just as short-lived as the ones about how slow the US was at vaccination.

10847,You mean no personal responsibility.
10848,My only problem is the papers we were already given aren't good enough for many.

10925,Haven't heard about any of this.
10926,"Regardless of what happens my opinion is that international is fine, anything else is overboard."
10927,[removed]
10928,yes but the US gets out of school sooner than the EU folks do.
10929,The first two weeks in August in Sicily are pretty much shut down for holiday.
10930,NYC summer gonna be lit.
10931,Hot boy summer lets go!
10932,this.
10933,get another stimmy going.
10934,$1000 to get the shot.
10935,I'm okay with my taxes being used to get us all immunized.
10936,the only thing these idiots respect more than garbage leadership and conspiracies is money
10937,"The article is based on this report: The COVID-19 anxiety syndrome scale: Development and psychometric properties
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7375349/"
10938,Very likely it is backdated.
10939,"The daily figure is not the date of death, but the date it is reported."
10940,"Generally this figure includes data from the last 5 days, but it can include deaths from months in the past."
10941,I can't link to it but H*ffington Post has a really good article on this today.
10942,"Basically so much shaming of activities (some warranted, some not) happened that people internalized ""staying home = good person"" as a personality trait, so it's hard to break out of that."
10943,"Personally, two weeks after my second vaccine shot I plan on living live normally and going out to eat, going to a baseball game, etc."
10944,"It's not a societal on/off switch, it's millions of individuals flipping their own switch at once."
10945,"This is also true, but while they have covid they may give it to individuals that aren't able to get vaccinated for whatever legitimate reason (immunocompromised, allergies, etc) and can cause the death or illness that way, much like the Disneyland Measles outbreak a couple years ago."
10946,"The better option is to vaccinate as many people as possible and, yes, it may require a ""carrot. """
10947,So youre saying our excess death count is under counted?
10948,yeah??
10949,well how about getting one green pass deal going so I can file for it for my trip this summer.
10950,Great news all around for families everywhere!
10951,I have a toddler and one on the way.
10952,Any insight until how long it'll be until they're egible for the vaccine?
10953,Thank you.
10954,It can slow it.
10955,"But it seems like the right thing to do would be to help our neighbors to the North and South, when we have so many doses no one is interested in here."
10956,If you are naturally low in ACE2 receptors I bet this enhances the effect.
10957,I've wondered now for a while if my long term covid symptoms were related to some type of genetic conditions that makes me naturally lower in ACE2 receptor.
10958,The first shot of the vaccine made me feel like I had covid again (light covid).
10959,Lasted for a couple of weeks.
10960,The second shot wasn't bad at all.
10961,Probably because I had a ton of antibodies running around to neutralize things quicker.
10962,I also find myself wondering if making antibodies that target that spike protein could also create issues.
10963,I mean it must mimic Angiotensin II to some extent so could antibodies show some binding to that?
10964,Down regulation of Angiotensin II causes all kinds of issues in the body.
10965,Great article though!
10966,What would you estimate it to really be?
10967,So your wording is slightly misleading for what is on the link.
10968,"In Alabama, it's 24% of vaccinated people are black not that 24% of black people are vaccinated."
10969,You are considering an all or none approach.
10970,Not necessarily the case.
10971,One can have it in a small scale with vaccination proof for citizens only.
10972,Everyone who has stood by the vaccination effort deserves a break
10973,[removed]
10974,Mostly people want to and now it seems like people can voluntary opt for it.
10975,"But denmark's decision is also based, we will get enough of the MRNA vaccines, so there's that to it."
10976,"If that wasn't the case, we would still use the AZ and J&amp;J vaccines."
10977,Yeah.

10986,It was a joke - it's funny to people because it is very obvious that the commenter was happy that their child could get the vaccine soon.
10987,You even pointed out that it was obvious.
10988,"The response, then, to misdirect and pretend that they must be talking about how happy the other commenter is  that their child has CF was more unexpected and of course not something that people would be usually happy with."
10989,This makes people laugh.
10990,I know I might be over-explaining the joke here people but I recently started a course in disability support and didn't realize that sometimes people with Autism and similar take things quite literally and don't understand jokes.
10991,I didn't want to assume the commenter here was stupid - perhaps they just don't understand the joke :)
10992,This subreddit is overrun by anti-maskers and outright COVID deniers.

10995,Can you work the next day after first dose of Pfizer?
10996,Not sure how bad these side effects are supposed to be
10997,"Vaccination is not 100% effective—even in the Pfizer trial that showed 100% effectiveness in children, I would never buy that it's 100% effective forever."
10998,"Even though vaccinated, I could still contract COVID, and I could still get very, very sick from it."
10999,"The chances are very slim, but they're there."
11000,"Yeah, post-vaccination I've definitely opened up on what I'm comfortable doing but no way in hell am I engaging in indoor dining until case levels have dropped considerably from where they are at currently."
11001,Especially since vaccine passports don't look like they'll become a thing so I wouldn't be able to do a much lower risk version of indoor dining by going to a place that was only open to people who have had their shots.
11002,"Honestly, if the worst side effect of COVID anxiety I get is that I prefer outdoor seating in nicer weather, I don't think I'll complain."
11003,"Thank you for posting this, my husband and I are fully vaccinated but we have a 3 year old and an 18 month old and I was worried we'd be waiting ages before something was available for them"
11004,"MRNA facilities seem to have an insnae sbility to scale up production and best targets, so I’m sure the supply will be larger than expected."
11005,I.....i've never related more to a comment.
11006,This year has entirely changed how I see people and i'll never forget the people who prolonged this pandemic and made it exponentially worse by their selfish attitudes.
11007,My own sister has traveled more times this year than she ever has before.
11008,My cousins have traveled with symptoms and ended up being positive.
11009,"My friends in the medical field and ones that work in nursing homes, both are refusing the shot."
11010,Other friends of mine have gone to bars and clubs and underground raves and then made ME feel like the idiot for staying home in the height of a surge.
11011,How do we get over this though?
11012,[removed]
11013,all good!
11014,"we're all tense and exhausted and on edge when it comes to this thing, and i didn't really clarify my intent in my original post."
11015,According to Danish media the US used Johnson and Johnson to vaccinate homeless people.
11016,And when a homeless person dies the cause of death is not always investigated.
11017,Therefore we cannot trust the US numbers.
11018,[source](https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/indland/vaccine-ekspert-som-fagperson-vil-jeg-ikke-anbefale-droppede-vacciner-som-frivilligt)
11019,Many industries benefit from government-funded basic research.
11020,"But assuming that vaccine development benefits more than other industries, is that really such a bad market distortion to have?"
11021,"Excess expected profits are dissipated by new companies entering the sector and existing ones taking on more projects, so that public health attracts an ""unfair"" share of investment."
11022,I suppose I forgot that the uk has no constitution in the same way other countries do.
11023,In Germany it would get kicked out by the courts in no time.
11024,It’s why the government is now giving back people their fundamental rights if they have been fully vaccinated.
11025,I think the USA would be the same.
11026,"That’s about it, plus rest too"
11027,Isn't this because the skeptical former President died and was replaced by a reasonable female leader.
11028,I just ate in person INSIDE restaurants in the past week for the first time in a year.
11029,There was some anxiety about it.
11030,But also a huge sigh of relief.
11031,"I am ready to return to normal, but will be safe."
11032,I will wear masks where required.
11033,"I'm fully vaccinated, but I still have this persistent anxiety about potential long-term lung damage and such."
11034,"I know that if I get it I probably won't be hospitalized, but there's no telling what kind of long-term effects it could have."
11035,&gt; They probably lack natural immunity on the same scale as California since it didn’t spread as much.
11036,I'm not sure that this is really supported by the data as the difference.
11037,California has some places that have had low cases throughout the pandemic and aren't rising like Oregon/Washington.
11038,"San Francisco, for example."
11039,[deleted]
11040,"As a PA resident it's so surreal to think that many states had little to no restrictions, PA had a 100+ day lockdown of everything but life-sustaining businesses, you couldn't buy a new Car as it was deemed nonessential."
11041,"I'm getting my first shot today, what should I do to minimize symptoms in the days following besides staying hydrated and moving my arm around?"
11042,The ‘ole Reddit switcheroo!
11043,That does make sense.
11044,I'm sorry if my reply was too harsh.
11045,I am feeling there is a lot of impatience recently from people who are ready to get back to 2019 normal vs people who are easing back into it.
11046,"Edit: Also, I've been thinking about the immunocompromised thing since I heard a news story about vaccine prioritization."
11047,Someone had HIV and therefore was in a priority group but hadn't disclosed this information to most friends or family.

11064,CA is doing much better than FL right now in terms of new cases.

11081,What's the legal situation for those who volunteer to take a vaccine that's not approved in the vaccination program?
11082,"I'm in Finland, and the Finnish authorities have now said a few times that the problem with volunteering is that the insurance/liability of the vaccine manufacturer is voided in that case."
11083,"I don't know if this is just bureaucrats covering their own behind just in case, or if it's a real concern."
11084,I suppose the liabilities could be a fair amount of money if a young adult dies or is permanently disabled because of a blood clot.
11085,(The Finnish national institute of health still recommends Astra Zeneca to those who are over 65.
11086,"J&amp;J is suspended for the moment, awaiting EMA's decisions this week.)"
11087,When did he say this?
11088,I don’t think your “if not not now when” question is such a mystery.
11089,"Wherever the person lives, time is only going to make our covid situation better as even with hesitancy, millions more are going to be vaccinated and our numbers are going to continue to drop a ton."
11090,"I won’t give a date, but this person might very well have some sense of when their state or country is going to reach a number that’s more comforting."
11091,I don’t put much weight into us not reaching herd immunity because that wouldn’t invalidate the point that our situation still going to improve significantly.
11092,His “as protected as I’ll ever be” really isn’t true and we all know that.
11093,We are all going to be even more protected as the weeks progress.
11094,"That’s not to say when one should return to regular activities, but I took the if not now when question to mean you were at a loss for why one might not return to indoor dining just yet."
11095,"Things are not going to be static, so there is something to wait for if one wants to do that."
11096,hospitalizations are going up but 80% of seniors are vaccinated so death’s won’t
11097,Biggest issue with the “vaccines are the path to normalcy” message is that for millions of Americans life never changed because they never followed Covid restrictions in the first place or never had them.
11098,There has to be a better way to message to these communities why get the vaccine is important
11099,[deleted]
11100,"That’s a really good increase, thanks for the update."
11101,I last looked a few weeks ago.
11102,Good news!
11103,"and I'd be quoting the company making the vaccine and doing the testing, and they say they are still testing the drug for safety, which you just said they weren't."
11104,"looks like someone else already linked it to you, did you bother to read it?"
11105,are you saying that Pfizer is lying to us in their press release about whether or not they are testing their drug for safety?
11106,"You should have relatively high protection two weeks after the first dose, I believe in the neighborhood of 60-70% and about 95% two weeks after your second dose of a mRNA vaccine."
11107,"95% efficacy means that in the trials that were conducted, people were split into two equally sized groups, one group got the vaccine and the other group got a placebo."
11108,For every 100 people in the placebo group who tested positive at some point during the trial only 5 from the vaccinated group tested positive.
11109,In the trials the mRNA vaccines were also 100% effective at preventing very severe COVID and death.
11110,"Yep, the vaccines reduce chances of getting COVID by 90-95% which is absolutely amazing."
11111,"But if there is significant community spread, it’s 5-10% of a much higher probability."
11112,"For an extreme example, an unvaccinated person in Australia is currently safer than a vaccinated person in the US due to basically zero community spread in Australia."
11113,"With the daily rate of first doses completely collapsing while 100mm eligible people haven't even started vaccination, I'm about two weeks from stopping all covid mitigating behavior."
11114,There are hundreds of open vaccination appointments within 10 miles of me.
11115,If people don't care about getting a vaccine then I'm not gonna worry about doing anything to protect them.
11116,I wouldn't distance or wear a mask to stop an anti vaxxer from catching measles and I'm on the verge of saying the same for covid.

11121,And hopefully the little kids get approved soon too.
11122,I have a 3 year old who wants COVID to be over so she can get back to doing little kid things.
11123,"As a resident of Alabama, I can confidently say it's a mix of things, but political is pretty high up there."
11124,Also there is the fact that I'm pretty sure around half the state had covid at this point.
11125,"Just anecdotally, half the people I know in the state have gotten covid and quite a few of them haven't bothered to get the vaccine yet."
11126,"Kind of hard to argue with them, they should go get it, I would get it if I was in their shoes, but evidence so far suggests that the rate of re-infection is still pretty low."
11127,"The part that has been beyond frustrating to me is how so many people, including the vast majority of this sub, dismissed this issue entirely."
11128,"As long as deaths were going down it has been all about opening everything up immediately, and the most notorious idiotic myth to have formed is that restrictions and lockdowns don't work."
11129,We have no idea the scale of the problem of long COVID.
11130,Data on it is very sparse.
11131,You're all just rolling the dice with no adequate information on the risks.
11132,"The scale of this problem will only be known after this pandemic is over, by which time it will have obviously been too late to do anything about it."
11133,"The time to act was in the past with a very simple logical argument: 

It's a dangerous virus that is going to go away due to vaccination."
11134,Long COVID and death are permanent.
11135,Restrictions are temporary.
11136,Better safe than sorry.
11137,But people didn't prefer safe for whatever insane reason.
11138,More isn't always better.
11139,"Gotcha, thanks!"
11140,I've seen that the numbers are really high even after shot 1 in new studies for people who've had COVID.
11141,Hopefully that holds true.
11142,"cats, dogs, and horses are very different sizes."
11143,they get the same dose.
11144,I don’t want to be mandated to anymore and I do not intend to mask my children outside on my own time.
11145,I’m fully vaccinated as is my spouse.
11146,"With luck, by the time a vaccine is approved for such young children we will have hopefully hit quite a high number of immune people in the population already and numbers will be significantly down anyway."
11147,"Seems like it would have been more effective to lock shit down and tell the community when you get to ""X"" transmission or ""X"" vaccinations they'll be lifted.. take as little or as much time as you want."
11148,For the one on the way I read that [COVID antibodies are passed on by pregnant and nursing moms ](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2021/03/study-shows-covid-19-vaccinated-mothers-pass-antibodies-to-newborns/) so hopefully the mother’s immunity will protect the infant.
11149,"Ok.  I’ll bite, what is the difference?"
11150,Basically how far are we from being able to walk into a CVS and get.
11151,12 yr old a shot?
11152,"agreed, i am thrilled to be returning to normal and look forward to not wearing a mask anymore but i fully understand people's mistrust of the CDC after they flip-flopped so much throughout this thing."
11153,"as a nation we completely failed at having a swift, unified, and competent response to this thing."
11154,remove it then
11155,"Sure, you can wear clothes in the shower  but that doesn't make much sense either."
11156,It's been proven outside there's a less rate of transmission and it's basically non-existent if you're vaccinated
11157,It's child abuse.
11158,https://www.thelocal.se/20210430/sweden-postpones-covid-19-vaccination-target-again/
11159,It hasn't been approved in the united states.
11160,50% effective at preventing disease.
11161,"Imagine we give 10,000 people the vaccine and 10,000 people a placebo shot."
11162,"In the control group (no vaccine), 500 people become ill and test positive for Covid over the next 6 months."
11163,"In the vaccine group, 250 people become ill and test positive for Covid over the next 6 months."
11164,We would say the vaccine decreased the rate of getting Covid by 50%.
11165,"You'll also see numbers like ""80% effective at preventing severe disease"" and that's the same principle, just looking at hospitalizations instead of positive tests."
11166,[deleted]
11167,I’m genuinely not.
11168,Some vaccines have different doses for children and adults (e.g.
11169,for tick-borne meningitis).
11170,1.
11171,"In the Netherlands and surrounding countries, many cases of human-to-mink and at least some cases of mink-to-human transmission was detected."
11172,It is very likely the virus continues to spread in animal populations.
11173,"Also, COVID-19 is very much unlike measles."
11174,"The R0 of measles is 12-18, while COVID-19 is (still high) around 3."
11175,This means measles has a much higher herd immunity ratio (95% vs. 67%).
11176,Also to note here is that the measles vaccine has been voluntary in many countries and vaccination programs have been successful.
11177,Mostly due to gaining trust from the population.
11178,"[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination\_policy#Evaluating\_vaccination\_policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination_policy#Evaluating_vaccination_policy)
2."
11179,Would it be concerning to you if the infrastructure that has now been build up for vaccine passports will be used in the future to relay other health-safety information?
11180,3.
11181,"I hope these programs will be regulated, but my experience tells me it will be relayed to some third party contractor where everyone hopes no-one will look closer at the security infrastructure."
11182,"Numbers look really low today, even for a monday"
11183,We talk a lot about the vaccine hesitant but geez the government and health officials really did no favors with a lot of the messaging.
11184,I hope we can learn from this and have a better plan for the next pandemic.
11185,"don't worry i have no intent to pressure anyone, in fact i came here to ask rather than ask them directly because i didn't want to single him out or come across as judgmental in a group text."

11191,My 12 and 14 year olds ask me at least once a week.
11192,We might actually have a great summer!
11193,Lol how do you think this is going to work?
11194,Do you think everyone around the world is taking the vaccine?
11195,If the vulnerable are vaccinated you are the selfish one holding everyone back from their lives and away from their families
11196,My anxiety comes from going out to a gathering that has unvaccinated people.
11197,"Not that I'm worried of getting it, but that I'm worried I'm somehow contributing to their illness or death just by being there."
11198,Like if I stay away at least I can say I wasn't a part of that event that had a bunch of cases.
11199,[deleted]
11200,"It's very hard to compare numbers between states, because the reporting requirements / procedures are different."

11206,Could someone help explain this?
11207,I’ve been trying to keep an eye out for ADE data as it is a primary concern for a lot of my family that is still vaccine hesitant (mostly from “doctors” on YouTube saying ADE is going to kill everyone who gets a vaccine🤦‍♀️).
11208,I’m not smart enough to tell if this article is saying ADE could still be a concern with the mRNA vaccines after the antibodies have worn off.
11209,Could someone help explain?
11210,Thank you so much!

11217,Are you still young at 60+ ?
11218,Then you should also shelter in place during flu season give the risk is comparable for young people.
11219,Have fun🤗
11220,It looks like Boston is run by risk averse germaphobes.
11221,The [second chart](https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106876913-1619910030536-20210501-0Ofsd-india-s-hardest-hit-states.png) is meaningless without population figures and/or total area of each region.
11222,"Delhi is a city, and it's being directly compared to the entire state of Maharashtra."
11223,"On a [per-capita](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/asia/india-coronavirus-cases.html) basis, Delhi's (1 in 14) covid numbers are far more worrisome than Maharashtra's (1 in 24)."
11224,"Some social medias, twitter included, have gotten a bit too comfortable with the lifestyle."
11225,Twitter is very pessimistic about the situation and I see a lot of people on there praise mask wearing up and down and say they’ll never stop.
11226,It’s very odd

11229,The CDC has been all over the map with their guidelines.
11230,I'm not assuming anything.
11231,I just don't think anyone can know for sure what the long term effects are going to be for something that has only been around for less than 6 months.
11232,I'm not saying it's likely or even possible that these vaccines are going to have long term safety issues.
11233,I'm just wondering how one can know for sure.
11234,Keeping my fingers crossed.
11235,That's a fair bit into the future so I'm hoping that gives vaccines time to get distributed through many parts of the world and things are looking up.
11236,Exactly.
11237,"I guess there will be a lot of first doses up until mid-May, then a week or two of majority second doses, then from late May a new surge in first doses (still with a lot of second doses)."
11238,"If things go as planned, vaccine figures in June will be glorious."
11239,My prayers are with the young children who cannot decide this for themselves :(
11240,"I didn't *want* to work, but I could have forced myself to if necessary."
11241,Felt like having a bad hangover for me.
11242,"I got my first dose the day before a holiday, and scheduled a vacation day the day after my second just to be safe."
11243,And what about jobs and rent?
11244,"Are all these people going to have to worry about losing their pay, their jobs, their place of living, and their livelihood?"
11245,It's sadistic.
11246,"And yeah, where would they go if India deports them."
11247,"Obviously, they have more important things to worry about... but if someone gets deported, where do they go?"
11248,Do they just jail them indefinitely until Australia takes them back?
11249,That would be horrific too.
11250,They're stuck in no-mans land.
11251,That article is outdated.
11252,We've learned more since March.
11253,Vaccines DO stop transmission in most cases.
11254,The vaccines work well against all known variants so far.
11255,"We won't hit herd immunity in the sense that it goes away forever, but we will in the sense that cases will plummet (already starting to happen) and the pandemic will end."
11256,There will so be isolated cases here and there but it won't be a major issue.
11257,I’m surprised this article didn’t get Rule 4’ed in this sub.
11258,We're likely already at the point where it's going to be minimal even if almost nobody else gets the vaccine it's largely going to be a question of how fast it goes down though
11259,"What the headlines always miss is that it's the ratio of patients that are changing, not necessarily the total number."
11260,"In CT, for example, almost all hospitalizations are unvaccinated folks (likely 97-99%) which, given how our older population has accepted vaccines, is mostly younger folks."
11261,"That said our total hospitalized has been tanking and is well below 400 (was almost 2,000 at the peak last year)."
11262,"So, in summary, yes the % of old vs. young is changing, but the overall picture is pretty damn good."
11263,"I mean, what's next is really my question."
11264,"I get that it protects lives, but what's next?"
11265,Hazmat suits?
11266,Permant social distancing?
11267,We live in a world of risk and we can't keep dumbing it down for the lowest common denominator.
11268,Nor can we protect every life at the cost of the living.
11269,"It shouldn't be a crime to show your teeth in a smile or be with one's you love for a special occasion, or socially dance with your wife or mother without a mask."
11270,Wife is a teacher.
11271,PRAISE THE LAWD
11272,The reasoning is that you are not immediately safe as soon as you get vaccinated.
11273,It takes several weeks to build up immunity and they didn't want people going and socialising in large groups 5 mins after having a jab.
11274,"You actually achieve best protection 2 weeks after the second jab which is 14 weeks after the first, and even then its not 100% effective."
11275,They also didn't want to develop an us and them society with one rule for the vaccinated and another rule for those still waiting.
11276,i've been here for the better part of the pandemic... i know.
11277,i've both had discussions with people in good faith and absolute wankers.
11278,"i'll still give them the benefit of the doubt, no use getting pissed over reddit comments"
11279,I agree.
11280,No shit things change pretty quickly lol
11281,"Heck, I’m already vaccinated and while I’d love a thousand bucks retroactively, I would support this even if it didn’t include me."
11282,We need to get more shots in more arms!
11283,Cases and deaths.
11284,It wasn't yesterday but today we also had 0 deaths as well.
11285,"We're also doing a great job with vaccinations, which is not surprising given the former news."
11286,Exciting but if you read the article it’s clickbait.
11287,"They don’t state any sources and say based on when it was submitted “it should be any day now.” Well, I could tell you that."
11288, What is an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)?
11289,"An Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) is a mechanism to facilitate the availability and use of medical countermeasures, including vaccines, during public health emergencies, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic."
11290,"Under an EUA, FDA may allow the use of unapproved medical products, or unapproved uses of approved medical products in an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions when certain statutory criteria have been met, including that there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives."
11291,"Taking into consideration input from the FDA, manufacturers decide whether and when to submit an EUA request to FDA."
11292,"&amp;#x200B;

 FDA Approval: What it means

FDA approval of a drug means that data on the drug’s effects have been reviewed by CDER, and the drug is determined to provide benefits that outweigh its known and potential risks for the intended population."
11293,"The drug approval process takes place within a structured framework that includes:

* ***Analysis of the target condition and available treatments***—FDA reviewers analyze the condition or illness for which the drug is intended and evaluate the current treatment landscape, which provide the context for weighing the drug’s risks and benefits."
11294,"For example, a drug intended to treat patients with a life-threatening disease for which no other therapy exists may be considered to have benefits that outweigh the risks even if those risks would be considered unacceptable for a condition that is not life threatening."
11295,"* ***Assessment of benefits and risks from clinical data***—FDA reviewers evaluate clinical benefit and risk information submitted by the drug maker, taking into account any uncertainties that may result from imperfect or incomplete data."
11296,"Generally, the agency expects that the drug maker will submit results from two well-designed clinical trials, to be sure that the findings from the first trial are not the result of chance or bias."
11297,"In certain cases, especially if the disease is rare and multiple trials may not be feasible, convincing evidence from one clinical trial may be enough."
11298,Evidence that the drug will benefit the target population should outweigh any risks and uncertainties.
11299,* ***Strategies for managing risks***—All drugs have risks.
11300,"Risk management strategies include an FDA-approved drug label, which clearly describes the drug’s benefits and risks, and how the risks can be detected and managed."
11301,"Sometimes, more effort is needed to manage risks."
11302,"In these cases, a drug maker may need to implement a Risk Management and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)."
11303,My younger 20 year old brother is vaccine neutral and too lazy to get it.
11304,I'm paying him $200 to do it now...
11305,I just really want him to get it lol.
11306,Strongly agree.
11307,"If I'm being honest, I've arrived at a point where I just don't care anymore."
11308,All adults in my state have been eligible to be vaccinated for about a month and a half now.
11309,"If I somehow catch and pass covid to you through my own 95+% protection from both, I really consider that to be your problem at this point, as you should be vaccinated."
11310,I've been dutifully protecting everyone from me for the past 14 months; I'm not now going to spend another 6 months protecting them from themselves.
11311,"I will say though I definitely see this ""anxiety"" in my actual life."
11312,Both of my parents are extremely hesitant to rejoin the world and still prefer for us all to wear masks when we're visiting.
11313,"My sister has had to go back to work in-person 3 days a week for a few weeks now, and constantly talks about how unsafe she feels there."
11314,"One of my friends still wears a mask everywhere, gets curbside pickup exclusively, won't see anyone, etc."
11315,and is dreading the day she gets called back into the office.
11316,These people are all fully immunized.
11317,Meanwhile I'm hitting the gym every day and hosting traveling friends in my apartment and going to restaurants and shit.
11318,"I mean really, what the hell are you afraid of at this point?"
11319,"I'm not even a risk-taker, I'm actually very risk averse."
11320,"The risk is just fucking microscopic, I don't get it."
11321,Get a grip.
11322,"This.... my wife used to work surgical/recovery and it was always short staffed for years before any pandemic.... on your feet the entire shift, always late to get off your shift by hours sometimes, no breaks because your patient ratio is like 6:1 and one of them  just coded because they're cool replacing hips of 90+ year old demented patients that have a 1% survival rate anyway.... and you still have to do the paperwork/charting before you leave."
11323,"patient care level drops significantly, more fatigue leads to more mistakes/med errors etc......"
11324,"Cases, vaccines, or both?"
11325,"We did too, a couple weekends ago."
11326,Sushi!
11327,It was delicious!
11328,....and then we promptly got food poisoning.
11329,I still kinda want to eat more sushi though....
11330,If by 'we' you mean 'in the US' then it might be.
11331,"But other countries definitely tried, and massively failed."
11332,It's not possible to isolate the high risk groups - they *will* be infected by the others at some point.
11333,Common sense?
11334,"No, it never was."
11335,Quarantine and isolation/lockdown are two different things.
11336,"In previous pandemics you'd see the infected being quarantined, as it has been done during this pandemic."
11337,"But ""only isolating the at risk groups and letting the others free"" was never common sense, and it never resulted in anything other than avoidable deaths."
11338,"We are still averaging 50,000 new infections a day which is more cases than we had this time last year when we went into lockdown."
11339,I don’t see how we’re pretending like the battle is over and we won.
11340,If anything we just accepted defeat and decided to learn to live with it.
11341,[removed]
11342,Just shelve it forever at this point.
11343,"J&amp;J seems easier to use tbh, just don't use it in young women."
11344,"This is true, but why not get Pfizer then?"
11345,I wouldn't take Astra if part of the risk demographic (young women) but Pfizer is risk free.
11346,I went into my office today to help welcome a new employee (laptop setup and such).
11347,"After work I had little time to run around and get food for dinner, run an errand, etc."
11348,It was stressful.
11349,I can’t imagine my day anymore without the lunchtime walk to the market to get dinner food and enjoy some sun.
11350,I don’t think I’ll ever go back to 5 days a week in an office.
11351,Why?
11352,Vaccines aren't protective enough/reducing transmission enough for the individual?
11353,Or because you won't know how many/who's vaccinated in a given space?
11354,[removed]
11355,"I have a few questions:

1."
11356,Is this something that is currently being studied?
11357,2.
11358,"For example, is this just because their immune system is so slow and weak that by the the time it gets going, the mrna has already degraded?"
11359,3.
11360,"If mrna ones (as-is) don't work, does JNJ/AZ-type ones?"
11361,Should they be directed there?
11362,4.
11363,Is it possible to make the mrna ones work?
11364,Like... a bigger dose?
11365,Multiple doses right in a row?
11366,Something to make the mrna more stable than usual?

11373,&gt;	The first round of distribution includes 336 million doses of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine -- 240 million made by the Serum Institute of India and 96 million by AstraZeneca -- as well as 1.2 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.
11374,The majority of the COVAX doses are AstraZeneca doses.
11375,"They have been struggling with production issues - which wouldn’t be at all resolved by forced IP licensing, because it is yield and quality that is the problem."
11376,"If the primary manufacturer itself is having trouble producing the doses, how will starting from scratch at a new, inexperienced location with no existing equipment or infrastructure be better?"
11377,Europe has also been impacted by these same production issues - they are not unique to COVAX.
11378,"Notably, COVAX has been responding by diversifying its supply - just today, a 500 million dose deal has been struck with Moderna, complementing an existing deal with Pfizer."
11379,"Once Novavax comes online, that will also greatly improve the supply situation."
11380,I agree it’s frustrating COVAX has not met its goals yet.
11381,IP licensing has nothing to do with that situation - manufacturing capacity does.
11382,"Before I get jumped on, everyone it’s approved for is vaccinated in my house."
11383,(Ok and all normal vaccines as well) How do they approve a vaccine for young people so quickly?
11384,My only experience with a recent vaccine has been the HPV one (I think) and that took like 8 years to be fully accepted and approved for teens.
11385,I’m just curious how they have the data to make the decision.

11426,"And for those that will pretend to be vaccinated, who cares?"
11427,They’re the ones at risk not the people vaccinated.
11428,What’s the big deal though?
11429,The only people I saw getting pissed about that seemed to be pissed that the restrictions for vaccinated people aren't being lifted more quickly.
11430,"They seem to want to know, ""what's the point in even getting the vaccine if nOtHiNg cHaNgEs??"""
11431,I have not seen anyone who is pissed at the CDC because they think vaccinated people should keep wearing masks outdoors.
11432,I had no idea some parts of the US still had distance learning.
11433,We're all in the classroom in Ireland and without vaccines.
11434,"&gt; Covid has made me realize how incredibly selfish the vast majority of people are

Yeah, the kind of person that's been going to restaurants the last year certainly isn't going to stay at home if they've got a cold or the flu or whatever and you know what, I'd rather not catch that stuff either."
11435,Have they had a lot of people?

11440,"Well, no one’s forcing you."
11441,I feel on the absolute other end of the spectrum - I’m 26 and could care less about getting COVID.
11442,So the ultimate irony came when my whole family got it after serious lockdown except for me.
11443,My life has simply had bigger worries than a disease that will likely be no more different than the typical flu to me (young and healthy immune system).
11444,I got vaccinated as a courtesy so we can just open up already.
11445,"It’s never going to fully go away, hell, we still have tuberculosis active in a huge chunk of the word’s population, yet people go out everyday unconcerned."
11446,I guess your IQ is single digit but I am going to try to explain it slooowly.
11447,Vaccinated person -&gt; Sars-Cov can't use person as host because of immunity -&gt; Person doesn't get to phase where transmission is possible.
11448,It's more about my children at this point.
11449,Once they are vaccinated I'll feel comfortable going back to whatever normal is now.
11450,"If the press starts tracking down patients that have died from VITT that has been caused by vaccinations, then this could lead to a seious backlash for the Danish politicians within Danish politics."
11451,So for better or worse politicians cannot assume that all deaths are the same.
11452,The EMA estimates between 1 or 2 blood clot cases per 100000 vaccinations.
11453,If we use Johnson &amp; Johnson to vaccinate 100000 people per week that is one potential nation wide newspaper headline per week.
11454,I think this is the real reason why we stopped using Johnson and Johnson in Denmark.
11455,I’m saying you’re making assumptions about what that continued testing means as far as if the EUA means it is less safe than full approval.

11463,"Yesterday, we asked him to meet at a grocery store to pick up some chips and then we were gonna go to the beach, he freaked out by the amount of people at the store and actually went home and slept due to being scared/worried."

11500,It's amazing what having steady supply can do.
11501,So many countries are rapidly making progress.
11502,Cries in Canada
11503,Thanks for being a kind human.
11504,Are you fucking kidding me
11505,Thats the whole point.
11506,To test if testing is a reliable way to hold large events.
11507,"The Netherlands does the same thing, with rapid testing (which is cheaper but not as reliable)."
11508,"Except, the difference here is that people generally don’t wear masks at the events."
11509,"They know who took J&amp;J shots, and they know who died shortly thereafter."
11510,Even if you double the numbers it is still less than 28.
11511,you can walk into target or walmart without a mask in my state.
11512,Have been able to for months now...
11513,"Honestly given the interplay in the tri-state, if one of us moves ahead, we all kind of do (or at the least feel strong pressure to)."
11514,For me the official end of Covid is the day the MTA lets on riders without a mask though.
11515,"At that point, I'm not wearing one anymore."
11516,Been vaccinated since January and more worried about being mistaken for a Republican than catching Covid.
11517,You don't get over a pollen allergy.

11519,So it's cool MU fans met outdoors then.
11520,I was so worried for them 😂😎
11521,"It's not pessimistic, it's idiotic."
11522,By the end of summer everyone in Germany who wants to get vaccinated will looong have been vaccinated.
11523,"I don't know, my office is going too far the other direction in my opinion."
11524,"No set day that everyone has to be in, so we might as well be wfh anyway."
11525,"I'm sure there are some places that are going back full time, but I'm seeing less of that in my circle."
11526,But how will simple IP transfers help that?
11527,"5K of genetic code doesn’t save people from the pandemic, doses of finished vaccines do."
11528,Producing more doses at affordable prices using existing infrastructure is a much better investment for the world.
11529,"We should totally invest in more production capacity worldwide, especially if we believe boosters may be necessary, of course."
11530,"But IP licensing is demonstrably not the constraint there - every viable vaccine factory has pretty much struck a partnership with one of the successful vaccine designs already, and GAVI/COVAX have a great logistics and funding plan in place to get doses to lower income nations."
11531,"Why can't they make a single type of vaccine that works for everybody regardless of age, sex, race, etc."

11535,"Whenever I hear that kind of stock response, in my head it automatically sounds like ""You just busted me for making stuff up that I can't support"""
11536,"i know why, i just won't say it to avoid further downvotes"
11537,you just didn't get it.
11538,"i'll try to elaborate: if one is anxious about going back into society even after they're vaccinated, because anxiety is not rational and we've been avoiding risky places for a year and then some, restaurant probably ain't gonna be the first thing they do."
11539,"i never judged anybody who wants to go to dine out as soon as they get the shot, i really don't give a damn either way at this point."
11540,i just tried to describe the mindset of anxious people (being one myself) when approaching a return to normalcy in the case of indoor dining.
11541,"this is a fascinating read so far, thank you!"
11542,It's a drop in the bucket buts it's progress nonetheless.
11543,I'd call it selfish
11544,"yeah that's a good point, especially with what the other person said about covid anxiety."
11545,"maybe i can suggest something a little more low key first, or find a bar with outdoor seating"
11546,Higher barrier for trial approval and lower priority compared to the elderly and working population.
11547,It's also harder to collect efficacy data in a younger population since there will be fewer infections in both the placebo and treatment groups.

11549,46yo and 5’8”... still waiting on that last growth spurt.
11550,I don't think that's true at all.
11551,Can you show something from around that time indicating that?
11552,Things have sped up a ton since December.
11553,In the EU Moderna has met all their delivery targets so far.
11554,"They will serve Canada from the US now, this will surely help to speed up your vaccination campaign."
11555,"oh that's a good point, i'll look into it."
11556,i think they only made the announcement today so i'll wait and see what's going on in policy versus in practice.
11557,Definitely concerned about the privacy implications of a private company operating this kind of database.
11558,I wish we had something from the government instead.
11559,The Terms of Service are there for everyone to read.
11560,"You break the rules, you gone."
11561,I’ve gotten so used to being home (and comfortable) all the time I’m not really sure where to go anymore.

11583,"I'm honestly fine going back in, just no more than 3 days per week."
11584,Being able to WFH Fridays would be a gamechanger.
11585,Collin County is also richer and has more people who have the resources and flexibility in their lives to go where the vaccines are.
11586,&gt; if they pack the park with people then it's obviously more $$$$.
11587,Which is what they're going to want to do.
11588,And many of their ways of making even more money have been reduced or not happening.
11589,They're eager to get back as much of that as possible as soon as feasible.
11590,"But, yeah, I think it's more likely they settle on no vaccine (because they'd also have to fight against the FL government) requirement, but it's not totally out of the question for a place like that with huge demand."

11599,"We know Pfizer and Moderna is effective against most current strains of Covid, but it’s not impossible that Curevac will develop a better booster towards the variant, which is why the EU is betting on 4-5 producers."
11600,Also the EU is heavily invested in Covax and having loads of domestic production is crucial in making sure the developing world have good access to vaccines.
11601,Whoops.
11602,You're right.
11603,I'd also check to see if social distancing guidelines are still in place.
11604,"Where I am the bars/restaurants can be at 100% capacity now, but with social distancing reqs (tables 6 ft apart, etc) still in place, so it hasn't actually made much difference."

11606,Go you for looking stuff up
11607,Happens to the best of us.
11608,Cheers!
11609,....probably because that was a vaccine approved for animals and not humans
11610,I definitely feel this myself.
11611,I've become a bit of a covid agoraphobic over the last year.
11612,But I know my behaviour is irrational.
11613,"I think the tough thing for me will be learning to ""let go"" of the stress of managing other people's behaviour (eg, the supermarket non-social-distancer, the no-mask train or tube passenger, the busy bar or restaurant)."
11614,I've got to work on this.
11615,I think I'll feel happier once I've had my vaccine.
11616,"I'm not planning on going wild, and I have no plans to endanger others by thinking ""I'm alright jack""."
11617,Baby steps.
11618,A lot of people here are missing that Germany is still in lockdown since December with increasing restrictions since few weeks.
11619,The lockdown is very unpopular despite being less strict than the ones applied in other European countries.
11620,Allowing Oktoberfest to go now would be very insensitive and would send the wrong signal.
11621,"Probably because it wasn't tested on your pet raccoon, Cletus."
11622,That message is on the packaging is legalese to avoid liability because it was only tested on those animals.
11623,I've been to many restaurants that aren't abiding by the 6ft distance between tables.
11624,A lot of these restaurants are so small they would only be able to fit a handful of tables with those spacing rules.
11625,My guess is that places start disregarding the rules over time.
11626,There's about to be a huge gray area regarding bars and what you can/cannot do when you are inside.
11627,"And if the choice was between no vaccine or the AZ, I’d suck it up and take the AZ every day of the week for exactly that reason."
11628,"But I’m not making any choice, I’m just waiting for my vaccine and I’m ok with waiting a week or two extra for the Pfizer."
11629,There are so many exceptions to the rules as to why people can meet that it is mostly unenforceable.

11638,There are also 90lb adult women.
11639,This isn't enforced and there is a page full of exceptions on the .gov page.
11640,Implying that it is simply illegal is very misleading.
11641,"Obviously not a lawyer, but that just seems like something that wouldn't hold up."
11642,"I always thought that if Disney or someone wanted to press the issue, they'd win."

11652,"If a place is open, and you and all your friends are fully vaxxed, there is very little for any of you to worry about."

11654,"Oh, no, sorry: everyone else in our house is fully vaccinated."
11655,"My being vaccinated helps protect her, her being vaccinated helps protect me."

11680,When homes are profit driven you get uncaring facilities looking to make a buck at any cost but when they are publicly run you get cost saving measures that weigh old lives as much less important than younger ones.
11681,"If your friend is not comfortable, then be a friend and don't force him."

uhh, you better never fly an airplane ever again then, because the chances of a blood clot occuring are way higher."

11750,The most likely outcome would be the person to be deported would sit in an Indian prison for a couple months until India peaks and Australia is accepting arrivals again.

11788,It seems way too extra to be pushing this hard to vaccinate kids.
11789,High risk people sure.
11790,But that should be the extent of the hard push to vaccinate.
11791,I think people here also forget about natural immunity.
11792,Or the fact that it is very very low chance for a lot of people to even get covid.
11793,Especially kids.
11794,Worst case scenarios anecdotes here are to be taken with a grain of salt.
11795,"She is more likely to contract COVID if she is unvaccinated, so *not* correct."
11796,"Her outcomes are better than mine if she does get it, but then she could either give it one of us or a classmate."
11797,"The whole point of this is to stop/limit transmission, and also increase our chances of surviving if we do contract COVID."
11798,We do know plenty of long-term issues that COVID-19 can cause.
11799,"Children are at very low risk of death, but there's a whole lot of other outcomes in between ""drops dead right away"" and ""completely, totally fine""."
11800,The pandemic being around until 2024 in poor countries
11801,They are wrong about being as protective as they will ever be.
11802,"The spread of the virus will likely be lower later on, which gives them more protection."
11803,In the districts near me the teachers are all in person but they still do “zoom in a room” because so many parents have chosen to keep their kids home.
11804,The teacher is teaching both the in person kids and the kids at home at the same time.
11805,At my son’s high school less than 35% of the kids are in person and most of them are Freshmen.
11806,"Sadly only till mid of may, then the second dose timeline kicks in,so the numbers first doses will have to be reduced brutally to have enough vaccine for the second shots."
11807,"India has its own vaccine (Covaxin) and is lisenced to produce AstraZeneca (Covishield)

The problem right now is the shortage of raw materials and removing IP rights wont change that"
11808,Not surprising.
11809,India and Nepal have had an open border since 1950.
11810,Almost all of what you said is false.
11811,"Nobody with a grasp of statistics would say that the breakthrough cases constitute a decent amount, and the breakthrough cases that there are do not result in severe sickness or death, which is what the point of the vaccines are."
11812,"And none of the variants are resistant to vaccines; they may have reduced efficacy, but no resistance"
11813,But we are slowing down on the number of people showing up.
11814,"Israel can’t really get over 60%, and they have vaccine passports for a lot of activities."
11815,I want to be positive but my fellow Americans be letting me down.
11816,they could just have testing stations at airports....

11825,&gt;  Being fully vaccinated means I have lowered the risk a substantial amount.
11826,That's not debatable.
11827,I agree.
11828,That's not debatable.
11829,"However, indoor dining then raises your risk a substantial amount, the magnitude depending on numerous factors (the level of community spread in your area, the specifics of the restaurant, etc)."
11830,"The risk still might be too low for you to worry about, but some people might want to wait for other factors like community spread to get better."
11831,I mean the covax program he’s been advocating for with donations.
11832,It’s been a massive failure even compared to its way too little goals originally.
11833,"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-56698854
The Covax scheme had been expected to distribute at least 100 million doses worldwide by the end of March, but only 38 million jabs have been delivered so far."
11834,0.2% of the vaccines have made it to poor countries.
11835,We’re talking about countries not being vaccinated until 2024.
11836,"The worry is with this amount of time to fester, it’s just asking for more of a potential of variants to form and then spread."

11846,It should probably be “second shot at least two weeks ago”.
11847,is remdesivir effective?
11848,I've seen that the WHO recommends that the drug not be used for hospitalized patients.
11849,I've also seen that the FDA has approved it for Emergency Use for hospitalized patients.
11850,I've been searching google and there's conflicting info.
11851,- Does remdesivir improve mortality rate?
11852,- Is it worth it for someone who is hospitalized to receive the treatment?
11853,Depends where you are in Europe.
11854,"France has a huge anti-vaxx movement as well, and the Nordics, Netherlands and Germany have better vaccination rates... but there are also anti-vaxxers and/or uneducated people who don’t understand the risks."
11855,"25-39 year old, all others Will be done by July (fingers crossed)"
11856,"Can anyone educate me here, is the JJ vaccine dangerous or what?"
11857,I did a little googling and found some stuff about it being halted due to some weird side effects.
11858,Any more reading on the topic would be appreciated!
11859,"At the same time, if it can be characterized as ""sneezing and sniffling all over the place"" then it might not be something that you could just get over, especially if it's something like pollen that'd affect you for months."
11860,A little bit of meds could go a long way there.
11861,"probably not in the USA, since we're not randomly testing?"
11862,"cases still mean 'with enough symptoms that a doctor recommended a test', right ?"
11863,"Even if vaccines \*change\* the ratio of deaths to cases (and with the very  preliminary data we have, they don't), more cases will still mean more hospitalizations and more deaths."
11864,I thought I would be like this but I've been very comfortable hanging around other vaccinated people and going out to activities like sports games
11865,I mean both by far
11866,Lateral flow tests have a high enough accuracy rate to be used instead of PCRs and in fact many times they are being permitted for travel.
11867,Why they are not testing you at the airport as part of the boarding process is just silly.
11868,Congrats!
11869,"I felt like I was being very naughty without my mask, first time out after both shots."
11870,A margarita cured me of any concerns and we had a great date night.
11871,[removed]
11872,Why is Moderna so behind in getting approved this age group?
11873,Throwing them away?
11874,"With the double mutant India strain and anti-vaxxers, we're still a long way from out of this."
11875,"A majority of scientists think we never might reach herd immunity, which is both alarming and serves as a warning that we need to keep doing what we've been doing for the past year-plus."
11876,"Here's the thing: if you're vaccinated and won't go out, or want to wear a mask at all times, I think that's perfectly fine!"
11877,"This past year has been a weird ride for everybody, and it's natural that different people have different risk tolerances and some people will be more uneasy to ease back to normal than others."
11878,I just ask that you don't judge those of us who want to recapture a sense of normalcy.
11879,"Personally, I can't wait to start moving back into my more regular routine"
11880,Hahaha now you say that I can see it.
11881,"We have rules for everything, doesn't mean we'll follow them but we'll certainly give a big tut to anybody we don't like that breaks them, whilst breaking them ourselves."
11882,I think a schedule like that is pretty reasonable and hope that's what happens at most places.
11883,"The reality is that there are things that are more easily done in person and others that don't matter, so having some time in the office and some time flexible makes the most sense to me."
11884,Just an FYI— I took part in a trial program for monoclonal antibodies with the specific intent of a direct treatment for people with weak immune systems.
11885,Hopefully this will lead to proper ways for your Dad to get immunity in the future
11886,Your link is by a pharma person merely linking other things talking about how complex manufacturing is.
11887,"Hell, not even manufacturing, just the actual processes."
11888,The first few points aren’t even relevant at all.
11889,Why the hell are they talking about failed trials for other vaccines at all?
11890,"We’re talking manufacturing moderna and biontechs vaccines, something which has already gone through the trial process."
11891,The idea that this stuff is hard and couldn’t be done is nonsense.
11892,It being difficult in no way means it can’t be done.
11893,"Simply discussing the process of manufacturing, discussing the process of regulatory requirements, the items needed for GxP, is in no way some informed “rebuttal” or reasoning as to why no one else can manufacture the vaccines."
11894,Have none of these people ever heard of biosimilars before?
11895,"Massively complex manufacturing is needed for this, not to mention the massive grey zone of regulatory aspects due to these being manufactured with living cell lines and the host manufacturer even changing its own product over time!"
11896,The vaccine is free and availability is wide open at this point.
11897,"Or do you think that people are having the same accessibility issues like in person voting (time off, reliable transport)?"
11898,"Fair park at least is commodating for DART, they have a shuttle to bring people from the train station."
11899,Maybe it's a cross between that and lack of communication on accessibility to get a vaccine?
11900,I think some people are waiting for cases to drop to negligible.
11901,[deleted]
11902,"Right, the healthy children need the vaccine because they could both put their grandparents in danger through (much reduced but not eliminated) transmission and help incubate variants."
11903,"In addition, at least one recent variant seems to be more strongly affecting children symptomatically."
11904,Data from over a year ago has questionable relevance today.

11906,Why are outdoor stadiums at 33% capacity but large indoor events 100%?
11907,Doesn't make sense.
11908,"I guess I worded that bad, it had the most total cases after Houston."
11909,"Per capita it wasn't so bad but there's a lot of people here and we still, as a county, had a lot of cases."
11910,A few weeks ago our county judge was literally begging on Twitter for people to come out and get a vaccine same day.
11911,"We didn't get hit like RGV did but we still have a lot of people and a lot of risk given how populated the county is, that's why I'm surprised if we are below *state average* on vaccinations."
11912,"I would normally dismiss it as a scale problem, but we have empty lines for the vaccine, or for being conservative, but the more conservative outlying counties have some of the highest vaccination rates of the state."
11913,We'll see.
11914,I still think it's going to decline quite a bit even in Florida.
11915,Keep in mind that in Florida it's really heavily in one county which is Miami-Dade.
11916,The rest of the state has actually not been that badly affected
11917,Was it deadlier per day and not per capita?
11918,Idk
11919,In a country with extremely low vaccination rate and the locals are heavily against having the Olympics.
11920,Governments never act in the best interest of the people.
11921,[removed]
11922,The government should be able to mandate masks for as long as they need.
11923,The same goes for any other public health measure and any vaccine.
11924,My fiance is nhs admin staff mate she worked Saturday.
11925,But she also just told me you're right so fair enough mate haha.
11926,Weekends are often voluntary and most don't do it prior to a bank holiday so they can have that long weekend.

11939,In terms of cases/deaths per capita throughout the whole pandemic Oregon and Washington are both at the bottom.
11940,They probably lack natural immunity on the same scale as California since it didn’t spread as much.
11941,Cases may spike but I'm hoping the at risk people are already vaccinated so this shouldn't translate into a hospitalization/deaths surge.

11947,I'm not saying it is or isn't safe.
11948,I'm just reiterating that EUA does relate to safety because phase 3 of clinical trials are not completed and that there are potential (possibly unknown) threats that are outweighs by the potential/realized benefits

11959,&gt;	I think it’s because vaccines aren’t dependent on body mass like medications are.
11960,A vaccine just needs to trigger your immune response but medications are absorbed by your tissues.
11961,"The more mass you have, the more tissue you have."
11962,Your immune system isn’t so dependent on mass.
11963,You’ll never be bulletproof but once you have the vaccine that’s as close as you get.
11964,Why get the vaccine otherwise?
11965,Just hope that numbers fall to whatever random rate you want?
11966,Hence why the most likely outcome is anyone slated for deportation gets to sit in an Indian prison for longer.
11967,But for regular travel you are currently required to have a 14 day stopover elsewhere so if India really wanted someone gone quickly that would be their best bet.

* Younger populations (we're stalling out at ~40% of &lt;30 year olds getting a shot nationwide)."

12011,Below is a view of whether states are supply constrained or demand constrained.
12012,"Based on current run rate of doses administered (7-day moving average for each state) and the available supply (doses delivered minus doses administered), I calculate ""days of supply"" as a proxy for likely constraint."
12013,"If there are more than 21 days of supply, I assume that the state is demand constrained: the state is probably not able to effectively use all of its doses."
12014,"If there are between 14 and 21 days of supply, it is unclear whether that state is either demand constrained or supply constrained (or just has bad logistics)."
12015,"if there are less than 14 days of supply, then I assume the state is supply constrained - if they had more doses, they could probably get more shots in arms."
12016,No states have become supply constrained that were not already supply constrained since last Sunday.
12017,"6 states became demand constrained (noted with an asterisk below): North Dakota, Illinois, California, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Deleware."
12018,"4 states moved from ""supply constrained"" to ""unclear"": Colorado, New Jersey, Hawaii (note this was due to a data dump last week - this is more a return to normalcy for Hawaii), and Maine."
12019,"No states moved from ""Unclear"" to ""Supply Constrained""."
12020,"Currently, only Massachusetts, Wisconsin, and Minnesota meet the criteria above to be considered supply constrained."
12021,"Based on trends in data, this is likely the last week any state will be supply constrained (at least under the current definition)."
12022,This is a pretty significant milestone.
12023,"While access may remain an issue for some vulnerable populations, it is now true that in any state most anyone who wants a vaccine can get one with relative ease."

12025,Half my town didn’t get the memo
12026,"You want to stoke the flames of hatred over a post that was removed, deleted and even had the state newspaper condemn it?"
12027,Source?
12028,Huh?
12029,Every virus and situation is unique.
12030,Measles is so contagious that it requires well over 90% of people to be vaccinated to provide herd immunity.
12031,We don’t know what that percentage is for covid.
12032,Please stop spreading misinformation.
12033,[removed]
12034,I don't think this is necessarily true.
12035,Scare tactics tend to only work on people that are already following the rules.
12036,[removed]
12037,I'm super excited for those people to keep wearing masks and protecting me.
12038,"For myself, fuck masks."
12039,Vaccines are where it's at.
12040,"I've never gotten a flu vaccine before, but will for sure start."
12041,The vaccine advancements we've had over the last year make me wonder if we could eliminate flu over the next few years.
12042,How about metro area?
12043,Major city?
12044,I honestly never thought about that angle.
12045,It is very easy for anti-vax crowds to pretend to be over caring and too cautious.
12046,Thus creating the feeling of why bother.
12047,Very interesting.
12048,A lot of us are waiting on kids being able to be vaccinated.
12049,"Until my kids are vaccinated, we’re not going anywhere."
12050,Except that an enormous chunk of the population (children under 16) cannot get the vaccine.
12051,"Yes, children are more resistant to the virus, but it's still a risk so long as it's circulating in the population."
12052,[removed]
12053,[removed]
12054,I agree but China is very strict.
12055,I will change sooner than later  just gotta ride the storm out and hope that nothing crazy come out of India.... place sounds like madness
12056,"Yeah, I liked Biden more than Trump but it’s annoying seeing the media treat him with kid’s gloves."
12057,So we have a stock pile to send?
12058,Where were the ventilators when my dad needed one.
12059,He died a few weeks ago with complications from pnuemonia.
12060,He needed a ventilator but there were none available as they were all used up by incoming covid patients from Toronto.
12061,[removed]
12062,The term pandemic means it's spreading across multiple countries.
12063,In 2 months it'll still be a pandemic.
12064,"In theory, yes."
12065,"In practice, no."
12066,"First, exponential decline gets really slow at the long end of the curve."
12067,It takes much longer to go from 100 to 1 than to go from 100K to 1000.
12068,"More importantly, Rt is also a statistical figure that relies a bit on the central limit theorem to have any meaning."
12069,"When cases drop down very low, Rt is dominated by local effects - cities, neighborhoods, and even households and their vaccination rate and immunity."
12070,A nationwide herd immunity does not inherently mean a local herd immunity.
12071,This is why it takes a long time to end diseases endemically.
12072,"Measles took about 30 years for example (of course, measles is MUCH more contagious than COVID)."
12073,"Regardless, the more people vaccinated - and more importantly, the more people are vaccinated EVERYWHERE, the faster the disease is eradicated."
12074,As an extreme example (and ignoring children for a second) tie vaccination to a $5000 stimulus check (payable in cash at time of vaccination) and we'd have our last COVID case before the end of the year.
12075,And a lot of counties in Tennessee are stuck at around 50% or 60% of over 65 people being vaccinated so there could be another wave of deaths if there is an outbreak.
12076,It’s crazy that they don’t want to get vaccines.
12077,"Bangladesh imposed a strict nationwide lockdown for several weeks, it seems to have ben very effective at reversing the case trend:

12079,"People have been struck by meteors, yes."
12080,Just not many.
12081,I’m all for helping India in saying in general we’re not even halfway to being vaccinated as a country.
12082,They act as if this still doesn’t have potential to break out.
12083,Yes.
12084,Kind of insane it’s like that one way and not the other.
12085,HK is that desperate for ml tourists.
12086,Both ways should quarantine free travel for vaccinated people and no travel for none vaccinated.
12087,It would be a lot better
12088,And yet the antivaxxer movement keeps growing.
12089,Lack of education and lack of exposure to alternate (and correct) information is to blame.
12090,As well as everyone living in an echo chamber of bad information.

12137,The health authorities have just stated that it can be done and looked in to how to do it in practice.

12149,"I **believe** that once certain areas of the country reach a level of herd immunity (like New England) and we see our numbers plummet, the areas of the country that still are seeing high case counts and hospitalizations will make a bigger push to incentivize people to get vaccinated."

12221,"They are being manufactured elsewhere, including India."
12222,At facilities set up with the manufacturers assistance.
12223,They need to do it hands on so it takes time.
12224,They have no incentive to not make as many doses as fast as they can.
12225,"What they don’t want to do, reasonable, is just release the ‘plans’ and let everyone have at it without assistance and oversight."
12226,"Edit: I don’t know about that random YouTube channel, but here’s a [link](https://www.cgdev.org/debate/would-exempting-covid-19-vaccines-intellectual-property-rights-improve-global-access) for you:

&gt; I agree that the current imperative is to scale existing vaccines as quickly as possible while maintaining strict safety and quality standards."
12227,"But for the premise of this debate to be true, there would need to be additional manufacturers who could and would stand ready to manufacture additional vaccines if not thwarted by IP restrictions."
12228,"I see no evidence that is currently the case—and, to the contrary, believe taking an antagonistic posture toward IP may actually slow or compromise production."
12229,"I'm getting my first shot of the AstraZeneca vaccine on Sunday (9 May), and I wanted to get some help on what I should know going into my vaccination."
12230,"I'm aware of most of the yahoo around the very small risks, but still, I feel like I don't know as much as I should."
12231,"I don't mean that I'm completely uninformed, but I feel I don't know enough about what to look out for or monitor in myself post-vaccination in the very unlikely situation that something should come up."
12232,"I know the gist of most of it, but all the information is so cluttered and confusing."
12233,"One minute it's 4 in a million risk, then it's 6 in 4 million risk, then it's 9.3 in a million risk."
12234,Is there no definitive breakdown of everything anyone choosing to get the AZ vaccine should know?
12235,"But on my end, I am 27 y/o, male, active and fairly healthy overall with no existing health conditions, so I am most likely all good but still definitely have that slight paranoia at the back of my mind."
12236,"So if anyone has been vaccinated with the AZ vaccine or has any useful info I should know too, then please do help ya boy out."
12237,"Some questions I have to start...

1."
12238,"Despite TTS/blood clotting being very rare, what are the symptoms of this that I should monitor post-vaccination just to be safe?"
12239,2.
12240,Anything I should or shouldn't do after my first dose?
12241,3.
12242,What is the definitive risk ratio of AZ vaccinations that result in blood clot cases?
12243,4.
12244,"Being on the younger end of people getting the AZ vaccine, is there anything else I should be cautious of or particularly look out for in myself that an older person wouldn't need to?"
12245,Any info would be super helpful.
12246,"Thanks, everyone!"

12248,What makes you think it would have risen?
12249,"Yeah, I mean the big joke is that nobody is enforcing any of this, like at all."
12250,But when your policies are both dumb and toothless then all you're doing is eroding your own credibility.
12251,I think it depends on each situation.
12252,"In a culture where multigenerational households are the norm, I've got two (separate) cousins living with parents; one sees it as a long-term situation where his wife will take care of his parents as they age, he's the main financial contributor, etc."
12253,"The other is a permanent student taking a few credits here and there, providing no income, his mother cooks for him and makes his bed, and it's expected that he'll hang out going through his parents' retirement funds unless they're fortunate enough to get a good marriage for him and find a younger woman to take him off his mother's hands, which is increasingly unlikely the deeper into his 40s he gets."

12267,"If a vaccine or medicine is needed to address an emergency situation such as the coronavirus pandemic, **once it is shown to be safe** and effective, the FDA can grant it an emergency use authorization, or EUA."
12268,"An EUA allows a vaccine, treatment or medication to be used before the formal FDA approval."
12269,The chances of the vaccine not being effective to a variant is extremely small.
12270,"And if it was the case, the news of that would come out extremely fast."
12271,You would know very quickly that there is a new risk.
12272,The chances of you getting sick from a variant that the vaccine is not effective before any news came out to warn you is so astronomically small it’s not worth worrying about.

12277,"If you watched the video, or were aware of anything going on, you’d know the US was blocking any raw materials going to India, so even if IP was lifted, the effort to manufacture vaccines was inhibited."
12278,They also have idle manufacturing facilities around the world waiting for IP to be lifted.
12279,The companies moderna and Pfizer rejected to a cooperation as plan in the fall.
12280,Can you imagine the situation around the world today if there were millions more vaccines being manufactured?
12281,"i'm skeptical of the messaging that public health officials like Dr. Gandhi are using: vaccines open up more opportunities to live your best life, so go ahead &amp; start re-socializing &amp; broadcast it to the world."
12282,"I get that they want the anti-vax crowd to think that they're missing out on something, but in reality this cohort has been back to normal since mask mandates were lifted."

12293,The delay will hit the 19 - 35 yr olds.
12294,Their date is being pushed 4 weeks.
12295,"So this is merely a matter of getting the vaccine to be free to move about, not a matter of Health."
12296,It is a no-brainer because of the AZ decision last month.
12297,"There is talk about letting people getting AZ if they want, but that will not be as easy as it sounds, because they will have to convince their GP to give the go ahead."
12298,"Yeah, we are in the position we are now through restrictions."
12299,It is great that there has been no uptick in numbers since we reduced restrictions and I have no concern with waiting just a little longer to reduce them further if it is data driven.
12300,What’s a good cutoff for that number?
12301,I vaguely remember seeing 50 per 100k somewhere

12303,"&gt;Yes, but it’s not beneficial for the EU to sign something that doesn’t guarantee deliveries."
12304,"If you have about 3,000 people dying a day as the EU currently does, is it better to get *some* doses on a best efforts basis, or nothing at all because the company can't give cast iron guarantees?"
12305,"It seems the EU would rather have a guarantee at the price of thousands of EU people continuing to die every day, rather than a lower death rate and best efforts that might embarass some EU functionary."

The Covax scheme had been expected to distribute at least 100 million doses worldwide by the end of March, but only 38 million doses  have been delivered so far."
12343,"I've been thinking lately, and be interested in your thoughts."
12344,The number we should be focused on for deciding our next steps is hospitalizations.
12345,"Not cases, not deaths, and not vaccination rates."
12346,"I know cases are an indicator of hospitalizations, and deaths, and vaccination rates are a future indicator of cases, but as we go into these next few months, I'm reminded of our strategy this time last year."
12347,"We were focused on flattening the curve, so that our hospitals wouldn't be overwhelmed."
12348,"Babies, heart attacks, and car accidents don't care about what else is going on, and we need to make sure there is a bed and ICU available for those in need including covid patients."

12351,"If we are at a case where it's trending towards being over-burdened, we back off and potentially close down more."
12352,"As we continue 2021, there will be cases the rest of the year, but they may no longer translate into hospitalizations and deaths like they did before."
12353,"People will continue to get vaccinated, but it will move slower, and it's impact will be felt less and less."
12354,"At some point soon, an extra 75k vaccinated in a state may not make a meaningful impact."
12355,Hospitalizations are what matters most.
12356,I’m in the same boat.
12357,Fully vaccinated and not high risk so I’m pretty ready to return to normal at least around others who are vaccinated.
12358,I’m fine with other people taking precautions but I’m tired and don’t want to be shamed for my own decisions.
12359,It hasn't been approved in the US.

12774,"So, if you're smelling cigarette smoke and thinking ""oh god there's definitely covid in the air, I bet 50-50 odds I am sick already"" you can do the math and say ""Okay, my gut is overestimating the risk."
12775,"There's actually only a 0.0005% chance that I've gotten covid from breathing in somebody's second-hand smoke."""
12776,Lol right a lot of great brewers on that list.
12777,None the less I’m happy they’re doing it if it will motivate even one person to get vaccinated.
12778,"Those 5 deaths are the total that would occur (assuming no change due to knowledge of the side effects), not the current number."
12779,Less than 1 in a million people die.
12780,5 is less than 28.
12781,"Bill Gates has *already* funded royalty free production of vaccines in India:

12787,I had my tech walk around asking people if they wanted a shot.
12788,"These customers, instead of just letting it go and saying no, had the audacity to complain to management about being ""bothered."""

12791,"Trust me, pharmacies are doing what they can to get rid of them."

12793,We aren’t gambling with our kids because we want to pretend everything is “ok” now.
12794,People in Nepal would do well to be concerned.

12796,If you refuse then you are asked to leave from the business.
12797,"It's really that simple, if you don't want to violate your  rights then you are not required to, however being a customer isn't a right either."
12798,Businesses have the right to refuse service and kick anyone out for any reason they want.
12799,&gt; is anyone with a child that is healthy going to vaccinate them?
12800,Seems a bit crazy to me no?
12801,Vaccinating healthy people is how you help keep them healthy.
12802,I hear ya.
12803,I’m just saying it’s not hard for a company to increase prices for any reason and then just include a wellness credit on the side for the vaccine.
12804,I completely disagree with the notion that a reward for being healthy is different than a penalty for being sick.
12805,"These wellness credits are just a penalty unless you check x y z boxes, call me crazy but I view that as a penalty."

12825,No.

12827,Measles and Mumps as well.
12828,When the hippie schools started exempting little Sunshine from having to get her vaccines cause Mommy isn't quite sure what's in them those diseases started popping up again.
12829,"Today is basically the cuttoff for making this decision because nothing, physically, has been done yet to prepare."

12831,"However, in May the Oktoberfest beers must begin brewing and in June construciton on the tents must start (which requires a decent amount of laborers that wouldn't be vaccinated)."
12832,Not to mention hiring of all the temporary labor that staffs the stalls and tents.
12833,That would be expensive stuff to begin only to later cancell.
12834,Sounds interesting.
12835,I'd love to see some real data on it.
12836,"I do have a hard time believing the difference between older elderly and younger elderly / right versus left is all that significant statistically and in terms of voting results, and that Covid fatalities in the larger group means the overall group gets stronger right-leaning, but this could all be based on my own bias with the older people I know."
12837,I'd be interested in looking at real numbers.
12838,"Seems like in recent history just looking at 65+ as a whole instead of splitting them up into smaller groups, their voting habits are pretty predictable and pretty significantly red."
12839,"Oh you mean the  ""Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act""  is to keep private business accountable?"
12840,Hopefully the states will delay the rollout to help those of us older and at risk to have a chance to get the vaccine before it becomes even harder when the kids start getting it.
12841,I see you’re simply ignoring the decades of work that occurred at BioNTech and Moderna funded by investors to refine the core mRNA concept into a viable vaccine platform.

12855,So the rest either gets it through their employer or it's see you at the doctor's office.
12856,And at the doctor's office you run into the people who could and should be at a vaccine center but want  their doctor to vaccinate them .

12878,Boston is going to be *three months* behind surrounding states...….why????
12879,?
12880,Contact tracing has been a joke for some countries to implement.
12881,We could have made that mandatory early on and got ahead of Covid-19 before it got out of control.
12882,Mask use should have never been politicised.
12883,"Bleaching the streets was definite overkill, but they took the threat to public health seriously."
12884,A couple months of extreme measures certainly beats the endless drawn out kid glove maneuvering meant to appease everyone in a way that no one gets what they want.
12885,Easy enough to get if you're an EU citizen.
12886,It's not they are saying the vaccine isn't appropriate for a 11 year old.
12887,It's that they have only tested for 12+.
12888,Without testing for 11 year olds they cannot - legally and morally - suggest that it's used for that age group
12889,"No, its ""I saw this posted on my nutcase social media feed and am going to repeat it"""
12890,"I used to have the same mindset, then I started taking Claritin every morning when the pollen got out of control this year."
12891,It's night and day compared to previous years.
12892,&gt; How is that not child abuse?
12893,Only if they are not seeking medical help.
12894,"It is almost guaranteed to be a medical issue, so doing nothing at all, or trying to starve the kid as a solution, that would be child abuse."
12895,Seeing a doctor is the only correct answer.
12896,"Authorize, not approve."
12897,You're not worth my time
12898,I think it's important to start addressing these issues now as restrictions are starting to be loosened.
12899,The CDC usually is a very conservative organization but there are still plenty of people angry at them for repealing the outdoor mask mandate despite there really not being much scientific basis for it for many months.
12900,"People are going to be confronting these anxieties rapidly over the next month, month and a half as likely all restrictions go by the wayside."
12901,"You are right, currently there is still reason for many people to hold anxieties and practice precaution; though it is important to start recognizing which of those are valid and which of those have just been trained due to a year of fear."
12902,What are your risks now that you are vaccinated?
12903,Are these events that gave me anxiety before now actually safe to do?
12904,"Should I reconsider the idea of ""needing' versus ""wanting"" to do something now that activities I desire to do no longer pose a societal risk?"
12905,"Doing everything you can to stop a pandemic was what was asked and it was noble, but soon the world will be normal, Covid may still be circulating at low levels, and people will need to address their thinking and risk assessments or they may be at risk for true anxiety disorders and agoraphobia."
12906,I things having these discussions now as restrictions begin to roll back is healthy.
12907,"Edit: and by world I mean the US/western world really, I let my bias show there."
12908,The rest of the world has much longer to go
12909,[removed]
12910,Yeah I also wondered what was the logic behind these kind of action.
12911,"Then I saw some antivaxx ""news"" claiming that the Pfizer vaccine is somehow transmissible from the vaccinated to the unvaccinated...."
12912,So yeah now I understand why those who believe that to start acting like this....
12913,"""FDA expects an EUA submission will include all safety data accumulated from phase 1 and 2 studies conducted with the vaccine, with an expectation that phase 3 data will include a median follow-up of at least 2-months (meaning that at least half of vaccine recipients in phase 3 clinical trials have at least 2 months of follow-up) after completion of the full vaccination regimen""

So it does have something to do with safety"
12914,Some mild and asymptomatic reinfections.
12915,Not so complicated and not rocket science.
12916,"&gt; so far it appears I was one of the lucky ones that didn't have severe or long-term symptoms

This is practically misinformation."
12917,"You should have said ""so far it appears I was among the overwhelming majority that didnt have severe or long-term symptoms."""
12918,The media has done such a great job distorting people's ideas about covid.
12919,A huge number of Americans when polled recently said they believe the hospitalization rate for covid is *fifty percent.
12920,*
12921,Is there a chance that by the end of summer India takes over the US as the most badly affected country pure numbers wise?
12922,Meaning not per capita.
12923,It’s so one sided too.
12924,People from SoCal just don’t give a fuck about the Bay Area while the Bay fumes over every possible thing.
12925,Exactly.
12926,"I think the restrictions have been pretty much as important as the vaccinations, to get us here."
12927,That's why they are being so conservative about re-opening.
12928,"Governments primary concern at this stage is that when we re-open, we **stay** re-opened."
12929,With as close to zero possibility of another future lockdown as possible.
12930,"Waiting another few weeks from here (as is the current roadmap) before restrictions get eased up, is worth it, in my opinion."
12931,I already have parent friends that vaxxed themselves and yet won’t get this for their teens because “the data isn’t there on the vaccine and kids don’t get it as badly”
12932,For the EU this is all irrelevant since it will be 100% Pfizer anyway.
12933,Much ado about less than nothing
12934,This is my school.
12935,"I saw 4 kids today in person, and 50ish virtually."
12936,This is probably about the least scary as a needle is going to get.
12937,It's a small needle and it's over in half a second and doesn't hurt.
12938,You probably are more likely to inflict more pain on yourself doing an average day of lawn maintenance.
12939,I think like everyone I didn't like needles when I was younger and had a bit of fear around them.
12940,"But as I've gotten older and had things happen like root canals or getting dye injected into a joint to have an MRI, none it bothers me anymore."
12941,"Rationalize the fear, take the pain (in this particular case there really isn't much of any) and move on with life."
12942,Think of something you want to do afterwards like pickup your favorite food on the way home and just think about that.
12943,"&gt;The United States this week will start talks with the World Trade Organization to potentially lift intellectual property rights on lifesaving coronavirus vaccines, as the devastating covid-19 outbreak in India puts pressure on the White House to move more rapidly to help stem the crisis."
12944,"Avis Budget Group’s stock price closed at an all-time high on Friday, a sign that rental car companies’ fleet-shrinking strategies are paying off financially — even as they leave consumers fuming."
12945,"Bowser kicked off a citywide canvassing effort at Lamond Recreation Center, where she slipped on a white “Take the shot, DC” shirt and matching mask, and knocked on doors in the Takoma neighborhood to encourage people to get vaccinated."
12946,Talk about being thrown into the fire.
12947,I wish them nothing but the best.
12948,The answer depends on how good the vaccine is.
12949,With Pfizer the answer is nothing at all versus AZ.
12950,It would be easier to do a lockdown for a month or two and have some sort of finality that you can give the people
12951,"I agree, COVID isn’t going away and I’m in no way saying people shouldn’t be vaccinated."
12952,Being vaccinated will help stop the spread of transmission to a certain degree.
12953,But I think it’s really negligent to put policies in place that people who are vaccine cannot spread the virus.
12954,It’s irresponsible.

12961,That's why the US is getting more and Canada less.

Moderna has 2 billion projected 100 𝜇g half-doses by the end of 2021."
12963,Of course if their trials with 30 or 10 𝜇g bear fruit that could jump to 7 billion or 20 billion.
12964,Their actual production levels are insane considering the tremendous dosage.
12965,Pfizer's vaccine is 30 𝜇g of the exact same mRNA formula.
12966,"However looking at all the vaccines in production, it seems likely that doses in 2022 won't be needed except for boosters."
12967,Scientists and researchers were able to develop this vaccine after using decades of research on previous vaccine and technology and test it on people in clinical trials in a big effort to see if these vaccines were safe and effective.
12968,"We have many vaccines (only a few for a Coronavirus) And we know that from our decades of vaccine research, the majority of long-term side effects come from within the first 90 days or so."
12969,"We were able to study these during the clinical trials, and complete the clinical trials very rapidly because there was a lot of funding, many willing participants, and high levels of disease activity which made it easy to complete the clinical trial more quickly."
12970,"So this is how we are using these clinical trials to evaluate issues that this vaccine could cause, including longterm issue."
12971,We can look at any issues caused by the immune response and determine if problems are arising in the people who received the vaccine.
12972,"I hope that ""a scary variant might still appear"" doesn't become the threshold for these things in the future."
12973,That's *always* possible.
12974,"And again, I was just responding to the person saying that this doesn't mean they're taking a pessimistic view about the fall - it absolutely does, and even if you think it's a reasonable one, that doesn't have anything to do with the point here."
12975,You don’t know what you are talking about.
12976,&gt;	Blockchain mining — the peer-to-peer computer computations by which transactions are validated and verified — requires a significant amount of energy.
12977,There is going to be very little incentive financially for requiring vaccines and a pretty strong disincentive for requiring them.
12978,By the time we get to July 4th or so when they were almost no cases nobody is going to care about vaccinations nobody is going to care about masks we will be back to normal.
12979,"Even for me since I am vaccinated and my friends are vaccinated and my family is mostly vaccinated, I largely don't care if I'm near people who are vaccinated or not."

12982,We won't get to herd immunity like some other countries.
12983,But should still see numbers decline for a while as the benefits to vaccines can lag behind the numbers for months.
12984,Neither of these vaccines will actually matter for the EU.
12985,The only one that does is pfizer let's be honest about that.
12986,Eu rushed for the first vaccine rather than waiting another couple months for determining what the best vaccine would actually be and ensuring that that vaccine would be the main one used

13010,But let me give you a hint:  calling someone paranoid for saying paranoid things does not mean I can't see past my own nose.
13011,It means I actually have skepticism.

13028,"I tried posting this article from New England Journal of Medicine, but automod blocked it, here's the beginning of it:

""Imagine a highly contagious virus circulating in the community."

13031,"Susceptible adults fare worse, with higher rates of poor outcomes."
13032,Would you want your child vaccinated against this disease?
13033,"You guessed we were talking about measles, right?"""
13034,ok and the article goes on.
13035,"but basically for vaccinating children against coronavirus, you have 2 benefits: direct benefit (protecting against children of serious but rare coronavirus disease, protecting children against  postinfectious conditions such as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children ) and indirect (decreasing spread within their family and community of the coronavirus)

The FDA is evaluating the vaccine for exactly what you describe--to determine whether the potential risk of COVID is greater than the potential risk of vaccination."
13036,"So if they grant authorization for use of this vaccine, many scientists, researchers, doctors have looked over the data and decided that the vaccine is safer than not getting the vaccine for this age group"
13037,"https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/emergency-use-authorization-vaccines-explained

13064,[deleted]
13065,I have a 3 year old so this comment really got my attention.
13066,I found [this press release](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-biontech-announce-positive-topline-results-pivotal) from Pfizer.
13067,"In case anyone else is interested:

&gt;**Update on the Phase 1/2/3 Study in Children 6 months to 11 years old**

&gt;Last week, Pfizer and BioNTech dosed the first healthy children in a global Phase 1/2/3 seamless study to further evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in children 6 months to 11 years of age."
13068,"The study is evaluating the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on a two-dose schedule (approximately 21 days apart) in three age groups: children aged 5 to 11 years, 2 to 5 years, and 6 months to 2 years."
13069,The 5 to 11 year-old cohort started dosing last week and the companies plan to initiate the 2 to 5 year-old cohort next week.
13070,Almost nowhere end up requiring vaccines and by and large it won't matter because cases will be minimal by early to mid June.
13071,Even though there will likely be a surge this coming winter it will be much much smaller than what we've seen I suspect
13072,"As the article says they won't deliver until the end of the year, Curevac might be able to deliver at the end of June"
13073,Germany is now administering more shots per person and day than the UK or US!
13074,Breakthrough cases happen.
13075,"They are rare, yes, but they do happen."
13076,If everyone is vaccinated that gives everyone a double layer of protection instead of just giving the vaccinated people a single layer of protection.
13077,It sounds like you didn't read my link.
13078,I just watched your video and it fails to specify mRNA vaccines and my link was specifically about mRNA.
13079,"And the parent thread mentioned ""Biotech"", so mRNA is at discussion, although I believe people, like you, are failing to differentiate between mRNA and non."
13080,mRNA and microfluidics are hard.
13081,Your link does not dispute that.
13082,*whoosh*
13083,[removed]
13084,Thanks.
13085,It's been a weird year for us.
13086,Show your work
13087,[removed]
13088,Well.....at least we are going to have a lot of doses to send our neighbors way.
13089,We can drag Canada and Mexico out of the shit next.
13090,It's really not a bit early though That's the thing.
13091,The deaths are going to be down to near zero by that point the hospitalizations will be minimal so nobody cares if you get sick for a few days frankly they don't care if you get long covid.
13092,Nope just doing some math due to my excitement of my kid being safe hopefully soon haha.
13093,No clue.
13094,"We only use mrna in Denmark, where the study is from."
13095,"&gt; Business are going to accept everyone, regardless of whether they are vaccinated or not."
13096,Depends on your type of business.
13097,I think cruises will require them.
13098,"I can see some high end restaurants, country club type places also requiring them."
13099,"I could even see Disney World requiring it as to avoid ""Outbreak at Disney World kills 7"" type articles."
13100,But like an Applebee's or your local dive bar?
13101,Nah.
13102,Why not Novavax?
13103,This [page](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/01/28/960901166/how-is-the-covid-19-vaccination-campaign-going-in-your-state) estimates that we will reach 50% of the US vaccinated by mid June.
13104,"(I don't believe that prediction includes vaccinating kids, which [should start soon](https://abc7ny.com/covid-vaccine-india-coronavirus-charges/10572704/), and will ramp up the vaccinated numbers even more)."
13105,Israel hit herd-ish immunity with [56% vaccinated + 15% recovered](https://www.jns.org/israel-may-have-achieved-herd-immunity-against-covid-19/).
13106,"If the same holds true for the US (with our 20% recovered), I expect us to be in great shape by August at the latest."
13107,We may never reach full herd immunity in some areas.
13108,But the risk of death or hospitalization is very low once you are vaccinated.
13109,So the deaths and bad cases will be manageable.
13110,[removed]
13111,I mean Oktoberfest is a relatively unique situation.
13112,If everything went perfectly and we achieved herd immunity by September then it could go off without a hitch.
13113,"However, if the vaccine adoption rate slows or a more dangerous/less detectable variant develops, well then you have 6 million people attending an event that, on its best years, gets thousands of people violently ill with the ""Wisen Flu."""
13114,That is the perfect recipe for a super spreader event beyond any other.
13115,"Nevertheless, Oktoberfest's cancellation doesn't mean that everything in the Fall will be closed."
13116,"Tollwood is still, as of last week, still planning it's summer festival."
13117,And there are lots of regional events that can still take place for the locals.
13118,How does that work though?
13119,"Eg, what if India *deports* someone to Australia?"
13120,Gotcha.
13121,Just wasn't sure if you were speculating or citing something.
13122,I was wondering if it was that or the iron ore and wild rice industries mandating vaccines for their employees.
13123,Basically the pandemic will be over May 19th in New York.
13124,People will stop enforcing the mask mandate at that point I suspect and people will gradually take it off by June to July.
13125,I really don't see masks going on for much longer.
13126,Even the airplanes where they're saying it will be until mid September I'm guessing they will pull it early for domestic flights
13127,You can’t just had waive reality bud.
13128,No inclusions there in your comment of the many articles which were brought up?
13129,Weird how you say there’s no evidence when there is plenty.
13130,Weird how numerous world wide coalitions disagree with the propagandized bullshit gates is pushing here.
13131,"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/apr/24/covid-vaccines-patents-pharmaceutical-companies-secrecy

Of course it has to do with gates."
13132,He limited the Oxford vaccine in the first place.
13133,And here you are now touting the silly things about QA.
13134,Obviously not what the person meant
13135,Which didn’t include the 1918 flu which was deadlier just not recorded
13136,"&gt; People need to see that this is something to work on 


Exactly this."
13137,"It is perfectly normal that a lot of people have anxiety at this point, it was a scary year."
13138,And something that we’re confronting is that the end is going to be less defined and more gradual than the start of the pandemic.
13139,"So once we reach the point where, within our specific communities, it serves no more purpose to wait upon vaccination, we need to ask ourselves; how do we personally reacquaint ourselves with normalcy?"
13140,"Again, I think you got it right when you said don’t double down on pandemic habits in a post vaccination society."
13141,"I think it’s fine to work through our individual needs slowly, make it low pressure, the world shouldn’t be going away again soon."
13142,"The other day I took the CDCs advisement, and I ordered some Five Guys, took it outside to a table instead of eating it in my car, and pondered how it felt to be actually in public without a mask."
13143,It felt weird.
13144,But that’s fine.
13145,Life has weird times.
13146,"The entire time I kept thinking to myself, I’m vaccinated, I’m outside, and nobody is nearby, therefore by resuming this old activity I’m not hurting anybody."
13147,So it’s just taking things at a comfortable pace.
13148,I can’t wait to do it again.
13149,"I’d say my next step would be to see how I feel about eating outside, but instead when there’s other parties of people nearby."
13150,[removed]
13151,"They seem to be claiming they're going to make up for the shortfall in May, but their April delivery schedule was a complete mess for Canada."
13152,"Shipments delayed multiple weeks, quantities slashed in half, just a complete mess."
13153,"What we were talking about was the hasty generalization that because the Japan Olympics might happen in two months, Oktoberfest should be fine."
13154,"Things may be fine in Germany by September when Oktoberfest is traditionally held, but I suspect they're taking into account their very slow vaccination program in Germany + the event success relying on international tourism for which the future policies are still quite uncertain."
13155,"As a total aside, should Germany get stabilized by September \*and\* allow international tourists, one could have a much more pleasant and relaxing experience with all the food and beer, if not better, in Munich / Bavaria without the insane crowds in relatively small areas, and probably better hotel rates."
13156,Go get that J&amp;J!
13157,Not really.
13158,Atleast up until a few weeks ago
13159,The police don't enforce it so no one is going to take it to court.
13160,The only chance of something like that happening would be if someone who's been fined for hosting a house party takes it to court
13161,Meh it largely doesn't matter at this point as the cases will be minimal in about a month to 6 weeks
13162,It depends on where you live.
13163,"They've been required outside where I live, which was very unnecessary imo."
13164,"But, it was the rule."
13165,Damn those first doses :(
13166,thank you scientists!

13181,"My girls are the last in our family, everyone else is fully vaccinated."
13182,I would like them to see their grandparents again!
13183,And my older girl is going to school two days a week.
13184,"It’s a smaller school so her classes are tiny (7 people is her biggest class) and she’s good about wearing her mask and using hand sanitizer, but I worry so much."
13185,This will make me feel so much better.
13186,I’ve been checking for updates constantly since pfizer asked for the amendment.
13187,"Covid waves: keep calm, it's only a spike, it'll soon stabilize!"
13188,Lol fool.
13189,I will not take any vaccine except sinovax
13190,"As a parent, I am worried about infection among US children."
13191,"I think ""Put your worry where the bulk of the risk is"" is very naive."
13192,"On a global level that's where the biggest problem is, but on a micro/personal level we have different risks."
13193,"It's like saying ""F your problems son, children are starving in Africa""."
13194,"Basically Covid gets in by infecting a surface cell (albeit not one with skin, but like in your nasal passages) then that cell explodes more deeper in and the process continues."
13195,So unless they made the vaccine infectious (which would be an illness in and of itself) then no.
13196,And it would be much more difficult to control getting the right amount into the body.
13197,In person learning in most schools with hybrid is virtually the same.

13205,"Now that I'm statistically as safe as any vaccinated person (and at the back of the back of the vaccine queue), it doesn't make any sense why I need to participate in pandemic theater."
13206,"And moreover, all society benefits the sooner we return to our normal habits."
13207,"Vaccinated/Recovered people should be able to go out, socialize, spend money, travel, and start resuming their lives rather than all of us participating in some collective sacrifice for six more months that serves no other point than soothing a few egos."

13212,"God I forgot it was like to actually do things, this whips ass."
13213,Actually they tried something similar with India but India refused.
13214,My godsons are 2 and 4 and their mom can’t wait to get them the vaccine even if she was a bit hesitant to get it herself.
13215,Now that she sees how safe it is she can’t wait until it gets approved for their age group.
13216,Assuming it that it will be at some point.
13217,SCIENCE WILL WIN
13218,"&gt;This could be prevented if the manufacturers made either pre-filled single-dose syringes or multi-dose vials with preservatives, like they do for flu shots."

13222,Go get em!
13223,Where did I say eliminate all respiratory diseases.
13224,we are completely capable of getting rid of covid.
13225,If doesnt mutate fast enough and we have 90% plus vaccines against.
13226,It also doesn't matter if most people are immune to it.
13227,That immunity will decline and less and less people will receive the necessary boosters.
13228,Once that happens covid will come roaring back.
13229,But there no need for that to happen we have the tools necessary to eliminate covid now we just need everyone to get a vaccine.
13230,We cannot accept two common deadly respiratory diseases running rampant every year
13231,Ok but that's not what I asked at all

13233,I've been living my best life since getting vaccinated.

13238,I can't remember the last time I had more more fun than I have the past few weeks and it feels like this is just the start.
13239,....BUT MY FREEDOMS!!!!
13240,!
13241,The issue with India seems partly tied to problems with reliable testing.
13242,"In Canada, before the ban, we had flights from India with COVID cases arriving every day, despite the requirement to have a negative test before the flight."
13243,"Flights from
India made up the bulk of our flight alerts and there were often multiple actively-ill people arriving on each flight."
13244,"There are occasional scattered cases on flights from other international locations (US, even with border closed; Europe as well), but usually one or two per 1-2 week reporting period, not many considering how many flights still arrive."
13245,"You’d expect that tests aren’t perfect but, combined with the reports of labs willing to sell faked negative pre-flight tests, there’s no way for this level of ill travellers, despite the testing requirements, to currently be sustainable."
13246,"We may currently have an outbreak of the variant from India in one of our quarantine facilities, so even that isn’t working well enough (our “quarantine” is far less strict than Australia’s)."
13247,This is great news!
13248,It makes it way easier for walk-in appointments and logistics for doctor's offices.
13249,[removed]
13250,"Yes, the FDA is the agency doing the emergency use authorization before they fully approve the vaccine."
13251,Yeah but it's a pretty low number so we (and kids) MUST get back to normal ASAP.
13252,"Well actually I am not a parent, but I'm an uncle and I totally recommend back to normal for my nephew."
13253,Oh and you're a shitty parent if you don't let you kid get 100% back to normal by now.
13254,/s because Reddit.
13255,It wish I were kidding but being berated as such is something I encountered countless times.
13256,I already smell it being quoted as fact even though in the article itself they're all opinions and not studies.
13257,As a CF mom as well- this is amazing.

13344,**YOU** are the source material for this article.
13345,**YOU** are why we won't reach herd immunity.
13346,Wasn’t there something about how a lot of it may be placebo effect as well?
13347,Like people expect to feel sick after the second shot so they end up feeling sick.
13348,"I am in the Pfizer trial and didn’t really know what to expect after each shot except a sore arm, and sure enough that’s about all I felt."
13349,I too count myself as being aboard this ship.

13358,"Well I guess you then can say it’s correct, however it completely ignores the different survival rate per age group, as well as chances of contacting covid."
13359,"Also from your page: 1 in 110,000 children under 5 will die from norovirus."
13360,This is way more fatal than coronavirus.
13361,To me it is a good reason to question the value of an emergency use vaccine for coronavirus in children (post adults being vaccinated).
13362,All I look for in my public health authorities is sound science and consistency.
13363,Every nation has not just the right but the responsibility to vaccinate its own citizens first.
13364,"In addition, in practical terms, the wealthiest countries are the ones it is most critical to get back on track economically."
13365,Can you imagine if the US underwent an outbreak like India's?
13366,"(Or put another way, if the entire US suffered the same fate as New York did in the spring of 2020?)"
13367,That level of outbreak here would have caused a level of economic disruption that could have toppled the entire global economy.
13368,"That being said, I do hope that now that we are seeing a slacking of demand here, that we do everything we can to assure the fastest possible distribution of vaccines around the globe."
13369,"How are you sure that future surges would kill more people after 1) vaccines are developed, 2) most of the population has been exposed, and 3) we develop effective treatments?"
13370,This is the worst it's going to be.
13371,COVID-19 isn't ebola.
13372,It's novel.
13373,That's it
13374,"I am telling force measures like people that got two dose vaccinates can go freely to cinemas, clubs, football matches, concerts."
13375,So in order to enter those events more people will be vaccinated.
13376,You can allow people freely go to Europe and Turkey and return back with no quarantine if you got two dose vaccine.
13377,For instance many US universities will not allow students that does not get vaccinated.
13378,Many companies pay for their workers to get vaccinated.
13379,Doctors and nurses in Israel are sent back to home if they did not approve vaccines.
13380,We are trying to buy Sputnik V for our country too(Turkey).
13381,"whenever a new appointment is opened, people quickly filled the appointments and go for a vaccine."
13382,Therefore I could not understand the people of countries that does not want to get vaccinated.
13383,The same false propaganda is going on in Turkey too but they could not convince more people even for uneducated people.
13384,For instance in Turkey vaccination rates for 65+ is %80.
13385,I hope we can buy more vaccines fro Russia to end this pandemic.
13386,Does the EUA come from the FDA?
13387,I know it's different than the typical approval process but it's not like a random approval without any science to back it up.
13388,That number is too high.
13389,"9.3M residents and 78% are 18+, 7.2M adults."
13390,"4.3M first dose/7.2M adults = 59%

It'd be slightly lower in reality because of 16-18 year olds, so you can probably shave off 1-2%

13391,"It appears that if you get it despite having the vaccine, you can still spread it."
13392,"But viral loads seem to be greatly reduced, so it wouldn't spread as easily, even for vaccine breakthrough cases or reinfections."
13393,[removed]
13394,Covid-19 doesn't ask for permission.
13395,"In other words, even if we know something, studying it further can produce additional information."
13396,What financial concern would come with requiring vaccination to take part in some privileges like attending large scale events or air travel?
13397,CVS said almost all the wasted doses were at long term care facilities so I imagine their percentage is higher than other providers.
13398,But they were also given the most logistically challenging task—going to thousands of unique long term care facilities to deliver vaccines where a percentage of the population didn’t want them.
13399,It’s a lot easier to not waste any doses when you’re running an operation out of the same site everyday and your patients are people that have booked an appointment to get vaccinated.
13400,"From wiki:

&gt;The municipality of Urk has the highest birth rate in the Netherlands

13408,](https://nyheder.tv2.dk/samfund/2021-05-03-vaccinekalender-skrider-med-op-til-fire-uger) It is a significant delay but fortunately pushing it 4 weeks doesn't put Denmark too far behind compared to the rest of the EU.
13409,Agreed.
13410,I can’t imagine this level of isolation as a teen.
13411,"And at that age most of them are smart enough to understand that, even if they are relatively safe from serious illness, any infection endangers their older family members."
13412,Not good for one’s mental health.
13413,I know teens who are champing at the bit for vaccination - for many reasons.
13414,Bruh we’re looking at 12 million doses for 8 million adults in q3 in Sweden.
13415,Q3 alone would get well iver 70% of the population of Sweden 2 doses.
13416,"Since all EU vaccination efforts are very similar, that would go for Germany as well, especially if they get those 30 million Sputnik V doses."
13417,[deleted]
13418,How realistic is a concern that with the patent made available that vaccines not up to the original manufacturers standards get made and injected everywhere?
13419,Vaccine hesitancy is at an all time high and I don't know if allowing anyone with the capabilities to make it means that overall vaccines will have the high standard of safety we associate with them.
13420,"Having said that I'm just a regular dude who doesn't know anything so please feel free to tell me this is fearmongering, I'm just not sure that allowing every lab with the ability to make it will actually create vast amounts of high quality vaccines."

13423,Once it's endemic you will have mild cases because you will have had it before/gotten a vaccine before.
13424,"That’s excellent, take the Sputnik vaccine and shut your yap then."
13425,There is also the variants which are more contagious.
13426,If it was still the original strain of Covid from the summer there would probably be spikes but they'd be a lot less severe.
13427,"That is indeed an example of a religious exemption, but I take issue with claiming it’s “valid.” 😅"
13428,Didn't Canada test them when they came in?
13429,The article says that they attract 6 million visitors from around the world and social distancing is not possible because they sit at communal tables.

13457,It doesn’t feel good to me being fully vaccinated entering our pediatrician’s office but our kids not having any antibodies for check ups.
13458,"Granted, a pediatrician’s office probably takes lots of precautions but it still doesn’t feel good being protected while the little ones aren’t."
13459,"&gt;I am telling force measures like people that got two dose vaccinates can go freely to cinemas, clubs, football matches, concerts."
13460,So in order to enter those events more people will be vaccinated.
13461,You can allow people freely go to Europe and Turkey and return back with no quarantine if you got two dose vaccine.
13462,"People can already do that without being vaccinated... And people were going to Turkey until they banned air travel a couple of weeks ago, but it still doesn't stop people from going there through another countries."
13463,"And no one could enforce the quarantine before, and I don't see it changing now."
13464,&gt;For instance many US universities will not allow students that does not get vaccinated.
13465,Can't do that.
13466,People are gonna be up in arms about that.
13467,And students think that they are immune to covid because they are young.
13468,&gt;Many companies pay for their workers to get vaccinated.
13469,"All they can is to kindly ask for it, but I doubt a lot of companies have enough money to do that."
13470,Especially not the government owned factories or corporations.
13471,"Still, they probably can offer 20 bucks, better than nothing."
13472,&gt;Doctors and nurses in Israel are sent back to home if they did not approve vaccines.
13473,Can't do that when there are not enough of them.
13474,They have more leverage than the government.

13481,"Yeah, good luck."
13482,"Looks like Russia might have to start exporting the doses it stockpiled for its own population, before they expire."
13483,Unless something changes.
13484,"Yes, it’s called investigative journalism."
13485,"&gt; I am pretty surprised that despite all this the 7day avg is still at like 49k cases

That's, in part, because the vaccine isn't available yet for people under 16."
13486,Once kids 12-15 are approved I would expect that number to drop and then drop even further once &lt;12 are approved.
13487,Its probably Lupus.
13488,"I feel like a switch flipped on this sub somewhere and suddenly any article on covid in America that isn't completely positive is now biased scaremongering

I get why someone might be upset by the title of the article, it probably could be considered click-bait, but the article itself seems like a fair and nuanced summary of a complicated scientific question."
13489,It isn't CVS's or Walgreens' job to actively seek people to administer shots to.
13490,These people really out here acting like vaccination status is a protected class in American society
13491,Good.
13492,"With any luck, they’ll catch it at least once when they’re young and healthy and so have some natural immunity when they’re older."
13493,It’ll happen anywhere and everywhere with unchecked transmission.
13494,We can expect more such variants from other places unless/until we get enough people vaccinated.
13495,"I would also consider them ""excellent"" on short time ranges."
13496,Still 20% not being protected at 6 months after infection suggests to me that we could never get to something like herd immunity naturally.

13514,"Yes, because being excluded from airliners for putting others at risk of illness is the same as being put in concentration camps and gassed because of your religion."
13515,I would say those numbers are great.
13516,CVS and Walgreens are also enormous.
13517,Are there any single entities that big that are also doing vaccines?
13518,Walmart is the only one I can think of.
13519,"So, if you are looking for the single biggest wasters using raw numbers, those would be the three I would expect."

13612,I don’t feel guilt.
13613,More along the lines of disappointment.
13614,"India had actually been a surprise in terms of the unexpected, fairly low impact on their citizens and there was a lot of talk of herd immunity etc."
13615,"Before mass rollout of vaccines, they actually lifted a number of restrictions, had large religious and social gatherings and now are in a world of hurt."
13616,Dumb humans in leadership positions carry most of the responsibility IMO.
13617,Where do you think we’ll cap out at?
13618,I’m guesstimating 55% or so…
13619,As your article blows past the IP owners have to ensure the factories can make the vaccines in a safe and effective manner.
13620,"If the J&amp;J vaccine kills 5,000 people in Bangladesh people aren’t going to assume that the Dhaka Vaccine Company fucked up they are going to blame the vaccine."
13621,You're fine.
13622,"I'm sure there are logistical factors here, but it's also true that misinformation doesn't discriminate."
13623,"In Spain this week or the following one we shoud finish the vaccination of 60+, that should help a lot at least."
13624,"Except all the manufacturers saying they can’t....


https://apnews.com/article/drug-companies-called-share-vaccine-info-22d92afbc3ea9ed519be007f8887bcf6"
13625,&gt; It pushes the vaccination timeline so that the last groups will be vaccinated in fall/autumn of 2021.
13626,Sweden has already adapted their vaccination schedule to this new reality.
13627,"The goal now is to have offered everyone over 18 the first dose by September, which means the vaccination will be complete (everyone given a second dose) by November or December."
13628,But still allowing anti vac “news” stories everywhere on their platform.
13629,"Because it isn't normal, you've been inside for a year."
13630,You'll stop thinking about it eventually.
13631,I just read an article saying we’re never going to have herd immunity in the US.
13632,I’m fine with still having covid around with negligible hospitalizations and deaths if it weren’t for long covid.
13633,Why the hell are very few of these articles discussing long covid?
13634,"This is the thing most young people are afraid of, not hospitalizations and deaths."
13635,This is what prevents me from living a completely normal life even after getting vaccinated.
13636,Saying “this is not fear mongering” after an obvious fear mongering statement does nothing
13637,I've always hated hand sanitizer - in general I'm always pretty near a restroom so I'll always rather wash my hands with regular soap and water as opposed to using hand sanitizer
13638,Key distinction that is important to emphasize.
13639,In the future these will almost surely be approved but this article is simply referring to an EUA.
13640,"Notice how the author of the article says “authorize” rather than approve, that is a key indication."
13641,They might have had a funding agreement with a deadline to recoup the money if they cancelled by a certain date.
13642,Or a form of insurance.
13643,That was the case here in Memphis with our annual May festivals.
13644,In the end the optics might be bad as you say but they're going to try to make that money until the last second.
13645,Can't fault them for it.
13646,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28101688/
13647,There’s numerous manufacturers saying they could increase the production if they had the IP lifted and know how to start.
13648,Our quarantine is supposed to do something like that but in practice has pretty much just voluntary; people have skipped out.
13649,And we currently have an outbreak in one of the facilities that involves a variant from India.
13650,There are a lot of families that are still waiting to be reunited.
13651,My boyfriend is fully vaccinated so I'm hoping he will be have to come visit me in July.
13652,There has been an exemption for couple for ages but the Embassy adamantly refuses to comply with it and a tourist visa is currently our only hope.
13653,"Per the CDC the number of people who are allergic to vaccines is 1 in 760,000."
13654,"That means there is probably 500 people in the US total, unlikely that any of them are actually in this sub."
13655,Gates has been utterly horrific the entire pandemic.
13656,It’s getting pretty absurd seeing fluff piece after fluff piece posted here on him.
13657,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ5DavuOkcM

https://youtu.be/tropM4cajFw"
13658,"Perhaps you could try making comments that are more useful than drive by ""nothx"" in every vaccine post you stumble upon."
13659,Which is weird how antivaxxers are fine with getting the virus but not getting the vaccine.
13660,"The vaccine is just basically a smaller part of the virus, right?"
13661,"I’m not sure how much encouragement you guys can use since you’re 15 years in, but... a friend of mine from school had some challenges along the way related to his CFF (cystic f***ing fibrosis), but he’s doing okay."
13662,We’re in our 40s.
13663,He’s not dying from CF.
13664,He’s living with it.
13665,"And hopefully yours will live for a long time with it, too."
13666,...so give them the assistance?
13667,"People getting COVID in Bangladesh increases the likelihood of variant that has dangerous, global consequences for everyone else."
13668,Weighing millions of people's lives against more profits for these companies shouldn't even be in question.
13669,Our similar failure to address the global AIDS crisis for decades has also had horrific consequences.
13670,"On Saturday, I was 1 week past my second shot &amp; I hung out with all my friends who were 2 weeks+ past theirs."
13671,This should get us to herd immunity
13672,"possibly yes, but this is still fantastic news"
13673,"Nepal - does not have a good relationship with China, and Tibet even more so."
13674,And they can choose to work elsewhere.

13676,"&gt;In recent months, public health advocates have urged the United States to do more to force Moderna to share its vaccine, which was developed and manufactured with significant U.S. government support."

13696,Trying to help my dad who got his second Moderna vaccine yesterday.
13697,I've been sifting through the search function for r/covidvaccinated but can't find very much in those anecdotes.
13698,"He's having severe pain in his right thigh, closer to the knee."
13699,He says he feels like he got shot by a bullet.
13700,"Some anecdotes online do list body aches including the thigh, but it sounds like this particular part is much, much worse than anywhere else on his body."
13701,Apparently he took 3x prescription ibuprofen (yikes!)
13702,which helped.
13703,We mostly want to know if this is something to seek out emergency care for (blood clot?)
13704,or just keep hitting it with the painkillers and hope it goes away in 24hrs.
13705,"He doesn't have a PCP and insurance doesn't pay anything until he hits his high deductible, so he is avoiding unnecessary care."
13706,The efficacy trials for Pfizer were recorded [only 1 week](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pfizer%E2%80%93BioNTech_COVID-19_vaccine) after the second shot - y'all are plenty safe
13707,"If an area records multiple weeks of low demand with a big surplus, their surplus vaccines should be reallocated to areas with a lack of supply until supply isn't an issue anywhere."
13708,And then donate them internationally.

13718,What I don't understand is why they're canceling it this (relatively) late.
13719,Let's say they needed to start planning in December to pull it off.
13720,"I think it's very reasonable to say that, in December, it would have made sense to not start planning based on the state of vaccines, cases, etc."
13721,But why didn't they cancel it then?

13728,Here's hoping their vaccine rate takes off and they can set an end in summer.
13729,It’s just a marketing expense.
13730,"I get it, I just think the net harm of people reading negative headlines and distrusting the vaccine is greater than the harm of blood clots."
13731,I know tons of people that don't want J&amp;J anymore because they now believe it's dangerous or less effective when that really isn't the case at all.

13815,The US just needs better vaccination 'passports'.
13816,"The card is way too easily faked, because it's really just a reminder card for your second dose."
13817,The flaw there is everyone was tested and came up negative before entering the venue.
13818,So the results are already a bit skewed and demonstrate that a non-infected room of people won’t transmit the virus.
13819,Which...duh.
13820,The real question comes in with if there are positive cases there.
13821,But that would be unethical.
13822,"Admittedly I haven’t heard of it happening too much anyway, but I’m in the US so that’s assuming we can rely on testing and tracing being accurate for the few fuller events we’ve had."
13823,So who knows.
13824,&gt;On the flip side there are also people staying mainly in who want to just wait till the mask mandate is gone.
13825,Hopefully those people are not waiting for CDC to say you don't have to wear masks anymore because they never will.
13826,Temporary setback.
13827,There will be millions of surplus vaccins in the west soon
13828,"Most people don't have anything beyond a sore arm after the first dose, but there's no guarantees."
13829,"You'll probably feel fine, you might feel like garbage."
13830,Thats true but we also cant administer as many jabs as we could if there was no reduced supply.
13831,"So yes, we knew that we will have to switch to mostly second doses but there is still capacity to administer more jabs than it is done atm."
13832,"You got downvoted, but I laughed."
13833,Why wouldn't the WH urge vaccinations in the US?
13834,It's literally their job to offer protection to US citizens.
13835,"At the same time, we can help other countries."
13836,It doesn't have to be either/or.
13837,When will we see non-emergency authorization?
13838,I want to see more places requiring the vaccine already.
13839,"&gt;For an extreme example, an unvaccinated person in Australia is currently safer than a vaccinated person in the US due to basically zero community spread in Australia."
13840,This is exactly why I won't be doing indoor dining until cases drop to background levels.
13841,What good is getting a 95% effective vaccine if I immediately start increasing my risk by a factor of 20?
13842,This isn’t necessarily true though.
13843,In the Nordics there were many cases (not compared to the number vaccinated) of narcolepsy following the swine flu vaccine.
13844,Now I’m not sure if it actually triggered more or less immediately but it wasn’t known until a long time after.
13845,The cause IIRC was a genetic predisposition combined with the vaccine or its booster agent or w/e it’s called in English.
13846,"To be fair, the risk is most likely less than other things their friend is doing like driving a car."
13847,.01% of vaccinated people are getting sick.
13848,500 in 87 million are getting hospitalized from covid after receiving the vaccine.
13849,Honestly the flu is probably worse than catching covid while vaccinated.
13850,People should understand how much the risk changes when you are vaccinated.
13851,And in my experience the in person kids are failing at as high rates just as the distance learning kids.
13852,The format does not work for anyone.

13865,Sure but those have already been vaccinated.
13866,And you need to evaluate both the risk for the individual as well as society as a whole.
13867,It would be unethical to risk the death of a couple of young people to save the lives of a couple of old ones.
13868,"Know that the Danish authorities considered giving the vaccine to 60-64 year olds (the next in the vaccine line), but even for this group - with how the situation is in Denmark at the moment - risks didn't outweigh the benefits"

Oof."
13870,That's a terrifying number which means there are likely many many cases going underreported.
13871,While vaccines do work Nepal has only administered enough doses to cover [4.2%](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/) of the population which is not enough to stop a surge.

13883,"And the best news is, with the massive number of doses available, your kid won't have to wait months after approval to get their vaccine like most of us adults did after the initial approval."

13897,&gt; Do any qualified scientists have reason to suspect the mRNA will behave any differently than other vacc types with regards to timing of long term side effects?
13898,"I'm not a scientist, but I have some scientific bonafides (my minor was in biology, and as an adult, I've contributed software libraries that have been used and acknowledged by scientists in several published academic papers, though that was mostly in chemistry), and my understanding is that no, there's no reason to believe this."
13899,"Vaccines are physical substances, like anything else, and get used up pretty quickly."
13900,There's no real way they can have some delayed effect many months or years down the time.

13909,I will always err on the side of caution.
13910,We haven’t gone this far without any of us getting sick (and I’ve not been working from home through most of this).
13911,My mom is also severely immune compromised so I will always be extra cautious.
13912,So did many other.
13913,Many people I know are fully vaccinated and still extremely reluctant to see people or go back to normal life.
13914,"I’m genuinely curious, anyone on this thread who feels this way, what does the end goal look like to you?"
13915,At what point would you feel comfortable resuming normal life?
13916,Keep in mind that it is bank holiday in Britain right now so reporting should be affected.

13926,*
13927,This is great now I can see my grandparents
13928,Death stats are very definitive and one of few things uniformly maintained globally.
13929,That’s why it’s impossible to say the pandemic death rates are exaggerated since since above average rates stand out so prominently.
13930,You'd think the virus wouldn't stand a chance against the amount of alcohol flowing through people's veins there.
13931,Is there really a practical difference between like 2000 Covid cases a day nationwide and zero though?
13932,"Restrictions are gonna be gone soon anyway, cases are plummeting"
13933,I can't see why more production centers for mRNA vaccines can't be set up.
13934,"It's not like building factories from scratch, there are high tech factories with qualified workforces all over the world."
13935,Well they will either get vaxxed or eventually get COVID and contribute to overall immunity that way.
13936,Me too.
13937,"The US covid death count is lower than the excess death count, although not by a huge amount about, so it seems reasonably to assume the US is slightly undercounting deaths and India is undercounting by a much larger error."
13938,The scientific decision was made weeks ago when the AstraZeneca vaccine was removed from the danish vaccination program.
13939,By the way it was also just announced that the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine won’t be used in the program either.
13940,This story is about offering individuals the option of getting one of those vaccines anyways if they wish.
13941,It seems like it will be an individual concrete decision rather than a blanket recommendation for the whole population and it may involve an informational conversation with a doctor and a day’s deliberation period.
13942,The danish politicians announced about an hour ago that they are going ahead with this.
13943,Basically hose two vaccines have been demoted from being recommended for everyone to being offered to those who want it.
13944,I mean to me atleast it’s a no brainer.
13945,In the US 1 person got sick out of like 5 million or something along those lines.
13946,Those are odds i can easily live with.
13947,US has A LOT of obese people.
13948,There still isn't a contract.
13949,I can only afford the one wife hahha.
13950,I work for a global firm.
13951,The firm DOES pay more in high-cost cities... however the adjustment isn't linear.
13952,"While I might make 5-10% less than my colleagues in other cities, my costs are over 50% less than those colleagues."
13953,"Likewise, my colleagues in our offshore locations like India make dramatically less, but comparatively they live much better due to low cost of living."
13954,I think the exodus from California is due in large part to the high cost of living.
13955,I keep reading articles about California techie workers who are leaving SFO for places like Austin Texas and others where they get an income haircut but can live like kings compared to SFO.
13956,I don't get what people don't understand about this.
13957,Vaccine side effects are all close in time to vaccination.
13958,"You aren't going to trigger an immune response, have that response end, and then see random effects years later."
13959,It has never happened.
13960,Your immune response either causes damage or it doesn't.
13961,Your immune response doesn't randomly reappear a year after all of the vaccine material is gone.
13962,It has never happened and fundamentally makes no sense.
13963,The FDA guidelines completely reflect this.

13979,You’re pretty “neoliberal” maybe which is just a nice name for wokish corporatists.
13980,Dutch making better decisions than the Danish.
13981,Same here!
13982,I have a 8 and 5 year old and we homeschooled this year.
13983,I'm ready for them to go back in fall.
13984,Most of the developing world is more likely to have a mobile internet connection than plumbing
13985,"Fifteen years ago in Nepal, I got internet on my laptop through the edge network on my mobile phone."
13986,"&gt; Personally, if I got the AZ or the J&amp;J I know I would be in a constant state of extreme worry for two weeks

This would be the worst part."
13987,"Even though I know it's super rare, this would make me super nervous and I'm pretty sure all the stress alone would give me a headache."
13988,US saves the world again.
13989,"By autumn, nearly all developed countries will have offered the first vaccine dose to all willing adults."
13990,"This applies both to Germany, and to countries where most of the Oktoberfest tourists come from."
13991,To cancel it is absurd and demonstrates a level of caution which is so excessive as to be out of touch with reality.
13992,The novel coronavirus is here to stay and circulate at least for the remainder of this decade.
13993,"Under this approach, there's nothing stopping Oktoberfest and other large events getting cancelled for many years to come, unless people learn to factor in the risks and benefits properly."
13994,Oh I get it.
13995,I have friends who haven’t let their 5 year old leave the house in 14 months.
13996,I guarantee you that kid is going to be a shell of his former self after spending 20% of his life in complete isolation.
13997,Imaging his reaction when he starts talking to friends in a year and realizes they weren’t locked at home isolated.
13998,How likely is that for any type of sterile injectable that is not one of these vaccines?
13999,How about for biologics/biosimiliars?
14000,As someone that was in the industry what you’ve asked is usually a talking point for companies to block any sort of generic treatment.
14001,A patent evergreening trick.
14002,Manufacturing issues are all around.
14003,Go into fierce pharma or a government website and search for 483 issues at US facilities.
14004,These are astoundingly common and some drastically repetitive.
14005,"I agree with you that it is better to get the first dose whenever possible and then if the same vaccine can't be obtained for the 2nd dose, get a different vaccine."
14006,"I know the CDC has authorized mixing of Moderna and Pfizer if necessary, and I agree from an immunological perspective it probably won't make a huge difference, it just hasn't been tested so we can't say anything definitive about safety or efficacy of mixing."
14007,Hi there.
14008,I'm very sorry that you are going through this.
14009,"Unfortunately, nobody here is really equipped to speak on these types of things."
14010,I'd advise talking to his doctor(s).
14011,I wish you all the best.

14017,&gt; forced to sell their patent for the R&amp;D cost.
14018,The R&amp;D was mostly done by government funded research.
14019,"They're not taking a bath on research costs, just losing out on profits from the bullshit system where public research is turned into a money printing machine for big pharma."
14020,Yay!
14021,I wish tons of fun doggie park zoomies for her!
14022,"Some specific owners of some labs say they could totally do it, but have they demonstrated this to any of the vaccine manufacturers?"
14023,Remember this is a novel vaccine platform that has never been deployed at scale before.
14024,"India, for example, is manufacturing the vaccines under license."
14025,But they are short on raw materials.
14026,"We aren't there yet, but at about 35m vaccinated (1 dose, 16m 2 dose) plus those with natural immunity that line is on the horizon."
14027,For children covid is not deadly at all.
14028,"12-15 will be huge for getting schools back to normal, at least on a middle and high school level."
14029,Hopefully this news provides some relief to anxious parents
14030,"&gt;we wouldn't reach full herd immunity but that shouldn't be the end goal

Herd immunity was never the goal."
14031,The goal was always 1) protect healthcare systems from collapsing and 2) protect the most vulnerable (65+/co-morbidities).
14032,The US needs to come to grips with this over the next few weeks.
14033,We're already at 83% of 65+ vaccinated.
14034,We have over 55% of the adult population vaccinated with probably over 20% of the unvaxxed having natural immunity from prior infection so we're pretty close to the healthcare system overall not being in danger.
14035,We're going to see a vocal minority of people insisting that things be shut down until we're near zero daily cases and we need to start sending the message that this is NOT a science-based opinion.
14036,Lol almost sounds like my puppy the past week while she's been healing from her spay.
14037,Luckily she's done this week and can go to the dog park on Saturday!
14038,Just in time for my 2 weeks after the 2nd vaccine shot as well.
14039,Also a Floridian and F this.
14040,Why can't local municipalities continue to make their own local decisions?
14041,Why is he interfering in this?
14042,"I had my first Pfizer, but was turned away by the hospital for my 2nd because of my reactions to the first."
14043,I’m still covered in a rash almost 5 weeks later.
14044,"FWIW, other than my allergic reaction, I had almost no other side effects."
14045,"They had a team of doctors and the charge nurse speak with me at the time, and I’m going to consult with another doctor and NP."
14046,"I had Covid in March 2020 &amp; had one dose of mRNA, so I should be okay."
14047,The studies show a negligible difference from the 2nd dose for those that had Covid.
14048,I am concerned since I may not be able to get boosters.
14049,"As it stands now, though, I’m continuing to live life like I have for the entirety of the pandemic."
14050,"We have 16 month old, 9 year old and 12 year old who have not been able to get vaccinated yet."
14051,We won’t be resuming any level of normality in our house until they can all be vaccinated (hopefully all by this winter?).
14052,My husband works from home and I have taken the last 16 months off from work as a midwife since the baby was born.
14053,"I was planning to only stay home for 6 months or so, then take a low client volume, but when the pandemic hit we decided I’d stay home indefinitely."

14055,"Bring it if you can, otherwise you'll likely end up with two cards."
14056,Easier to just have one.
14057,Curious what you all have seen as a reaction regarding risk assessment among your friends post vaccine?
14058,"I live mostly normally now, but I have some fully vaccinated friends who are still terrified of getting sick."
14059,It seems...silly?

14061,They should come work in America.
14062,The corrupt capitalist driven healthcare system will reward them and their hospital big bucks while the American people suffer.
14063,"Still, I assume there would be plenty of people of 40+ people with various risk factors for covid (obesity etc...) where J&amp;J/AZ would still be worth the relatively small risk."
14064,I mean Denmark's public health experts likely done the math here and they did handle the pandemic pretty well comparing to other nations but providing access to volunteers at least would make sense to me.
14065,It would be nice if they gave an indication of which chemotherapy drugs are associated with the lack of antibody development.
14066,You shouldn't have to go the extra step.
14067,"8 year old twins here, they're super pumped to get theirs."
14068,At least they're not totally isolated and have each other.... though I worry their twin connection is growing too powerful.
14069,Any day now I'm just expecting them to talk in unison full time like a hive mind!
14070,The India death count is severely undercounted.
14071,Still waiting for the final shoe to drop and cancel the Berlin Marathon.
14072,Though the marathon is still planning and advertising as if it is going forward.
14073,"It's bad in our area, there's a high risk infant in my family, I have two friends with no functioning immune system to speak of, and you bet I'm upset."
14074,It feels like this thing will never be over.
14075,I heard from a Canadian in Ottawa that they are having huge outbreaks and those truck drivers are still crossing into Michigan doing transport.

14103,"Well, at least in this pandemic."
14104,"Because before it, it was common sense."
14105,Yeah but many cases go unreported in the US due to people not being able to afford to go the hospital.

14167,"&gt;Brazilian regulators' decision Monday to deny emergency use authorization for the vaccine has blown up into an all-out international row, with Sputnik V's makers accusing them of ""knowingly spreading false and inaccurate information"" without testing the vaccine themselves."
14168,"&gt;  
&gt;The Brazilian agency, Anvisa, based the decision on evidence the vaccine carried a live version of adenovirus, a common cold-causing virus."
14169,"&gt;  
&gt;Sputnik V's maker, the Gamaleya Institute, reiterated its insistence that the vaccine contained no replicating virus."
14170,"&gt;  
&gt;The Sputnik V vaccine uses two different adenovirus vectors to accomplish this task, administered in two shots."
14171,"&gt;  
&gt;According to a slideshow presented by Anvisa regulators, the agency determined that the booster shot was ""replication competent"" -- meaning that once inside the body, the adenovirus can continue to multiply."
14172,"&gt;  
&gt;They added that this had likely occurred because of a manufacturing problem."
14173,"Weird that the sentiment you’re parroting is that if the lobbying angencies.... 

I’d say the concrete information is that vaccine production could be increased by lifting IP."
14174,It’s more that the suppositions are all in the side of refusing to lift it.
14175,“Oh it wouldn’t actually increase because....” when there are manufactures saying they could be making them now.
14176,“Oh it maybe will possibly sort of have implications for future pandemics” yea because that’s not some absurd supposition.

Interesting stuff."
14179,I agree that I wasn't specific enough.

14186,"Vaccines don't work as well in old people, and haven't been approved for children yet."
14187,At least for the next few months I think a lot of vaccinated people won't go places that they aren't sure everyone else is vaccinated.

14189,Why don’t you know about indoor dining when you just said you’re as protected as you’ll ever be?
14190,"If not now, when?"
14191,How do you discriminate between those who do not want to be vaccinated and those who can't?
14192,This is why their strategy will ultimately fail.
14193,Elimination is impossible at this point even if 100% of the population was vaccinated.
14194,Unless they plan to keep borders closed for the rest of time and continuously lock down when individual cases inevitably pop up.
14195,You made an assertion.
14196,I just asked you to back it up.
14197,The burden is on you as I have made no assertion.
14198,"But those are athletes who wil do pre quarantine in their countries and lab tests, then fly to japan, again in quarantine in special hotels, again lab tests."

14204,Fantasy world.
14205,"I don’t get this; I’m tired, yes, of doing nothing but being at home for more than a year."
