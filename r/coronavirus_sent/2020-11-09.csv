10,Glad you're feeling better
11,"could you use some specifics, i dont think i've heard that one before"
12,I don't know why you would expect them to have confidence in COVID-19 vaccines when testing is still in progress?
13,"You can't expect the federal government to be able to cover people injured in trials, or to be able to promise to cover damages for a vaccine that doesn't even exist yet."
14,So right now this feels like a reasonable place for things to be.
15,"Anyone currently pursuing damages would be a person from a vaccine trial, not a member of the public who received a vaccination as part of a public program."
16,So I think you're kind of ahead of yourself here.
17,"If the vaccine becomes available to the public and the federal government recommends it, assists in its development, etc, then of course it would be reasonable to expect it to be covered by NVICP and it would be a troublesome sign if it wasn't covered, but it's not at all strange to me that currently it isn't covered."

25,That just means you post a lot.
26,"Like I said, most of the time you dont seem to realise you are making mistakes."
27,You still dont really see why the article you posted contradicts your overly bullish statements for instance.
28,You dont realise the difference between something being not a problem at all and very likely not a problem but potentially a disaster.
29,You dont see anything wrong with accusing someone of ignoring scientists while blatantly ignoring scientists.
30,Thats just this conversation.
31,You should have a big of a think and maybe try and be a bit more rigorous.
32,I honestly think it would do you good.

40,And one of the things that has surprised me in all of this is how the people of the midwest are 'acting out of character'.

189,"Do 10% of people not generate antibodies at all, or is it just a matter of generating sufficient antibodies to react to the viral dose you may get exposed to?"

363,Drones everywhere.
364,Phones listening to them.

370,"So I have 100% of the symptoms of Covid, have had a 101+ fever 3 days in a row, but today I tested negative for both Covid and the flu."
371,What gives?
372,They said it’s probably some other virus.
373,Could it be a new strain of Covid?
374,Ironically Disney is probably the only place you would want to be in Florida right now.
375,Masks required and sanitation up to the nines.
376,"Wouldn't step one foot outside of the bubble, though."
377,I mean once the most venerable segments of the population are vaccinated life can mostly return to normal.
378,*completely* normal life might still be a year from now or more out.
379,But normal life plus masks minus music festivals sounds fucking great to me right now.
380,I work in a hospital and the staff has been telling the patients they don't need to wear masks while they hospitalized even though we aren't testing most of them for COVID.
381,WCGW?

Doesn't exactly mention spike protein but ""*decreased sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies*"" is quite concerning."
385,I hope you catch aids
386,I am glad there are some sane people in this sub.
387,I was really surprised by the super hyper of the pfizer news.
388,&gt;(CNN)Drugmaker  Pfizer said Monday an early look at data from its coronavirus vaccine  shows it is more than 90% effective -- a much better than expected  efficacy if the trend continues.
389,"&gt;  
&gt;The  so-called interim analysis looked at the first 94 confirmed cases of  Covid-19 among the more than 43,000 volunteers who got either two doses  of the vaccine or a placebo."
390,It found that fewer than 10% of infections  were in participants who had been given the vaccine.
391,More than 90% of  the cases were in people who had been given a placebo.
392,It is still at early stage but blown up by media and its logistic headache would be another problem.
393,But who cares?
394,Stock price shot up.
395,"And this case, Bloomberg is quite professional."
396,This kind of news is expected and exactly why phase III trial.
397,"But I am sure lots of other media would be happy to blow it up too, especially those usual suspects."
398,Some in general subs like world news where reddittors are much less sane they are already talking shit.
399,Reddit is really an interesting place.
400,Look...walmart already doesn't ask their employees to cover their stomachs or buttcracks.
401,You can't ask them to cover their noses too.
402,Why isnt Fauci on the task force?
403,Thermo Fisher
404,"It's called ""spike"" you idiot."
405,"We define ""fine"" differently then."
406,And you are an absolute dumbass
407,I have a theory.
408,The south got hit hard in summer when everyone stayed indoors to keep cool.
409,"The north is getting hit now as we enter fall, because they all go indoors to stay warm."
410,They are about to announce the dead guy they voted in as the new head of the ND Covid-19 Task force as he is currently doing such a good job plus offers a unique perspective to the task force by representing the recently dead.
411,&gt;Pfizer can only produce enough vaccine for 15 to 20 million people this year.
412,So twice that by next spring?
413,Right.

423,Should've done that when that big orange dildo held his brown shirts rally months ago ya fuckin dunce.
424,They will just say we don’t have enough long-term studies.
425,While it may be fine so far that’s just anecdotal and we just don’t know if it causes health problems over the long-term.
426,Whenever you hear that argument by anyone for anything you should assume you are being bullshitted.

444,"""The less involvement the federal government has, the better chance we have of this actually working out in the people's favor."""
445,- Can say that about virtually everything.
446,And that's as far as that analogy plays out.
447,But somehow you think indecent exposure laws are analogous to public health laws.

683,That year probably accounted for two thirds of the down payment (20%) on my house in Orange County.
684,"My wife’s job (OR) paid much more, and she accumulated her half in that year alone."
685,"We basically pooled $150K in a single year for a house, and there was no pandemic; just retention incentives because everyone left to the largest private employer in the region."
686,"No wtf don't get me wrong, I'm not the same user as that Torrent guy!"
687,I *want* to go back to normal!
688,I just don't know whether the government will let me.
689,It's also natural disasters!
690,"Rural Wisconsin here, masking is a joke."
691,People have yard signs and bumper stickers that say “My Governor is an IDIOT”.
692,"You know, because he tried to do the right thing."
693,"Sure, we have a mask mandate."
694,But 50% of the people here don’t adhere to it and still host large gatherings and go to the bar like nothing is going on.
695,I’m really starting to hate people.
696,Gotta be alive to pay a mortgage.
697,People are already thinking the virus was a democrat hoax all along due to a vaccine being announced after the election.
698,News coverage won’t change that the local leadership has refused to enforce greater prevention methods.
699,[deleted]
700,Almost 90% of ohio counties are trending up right now: http://covid.maxheckel.me/
701,This governor seems like a dumbass
702,I think folks are being incredibly hyperbolic about my standpoint.
703,"Old folks need to be towards the front of the line but it point plank does not make sense to vaccinate them right after healthcare workers, ESPECIALLY at this point when we have no efficacy data in these older populations."
704,"Dude, I want the old people I love to get vaccinated as soon as possible."
705,I also recognize that that approach does not do as much from a community health standpoint as vaccinating essential workers.
706,They don’t like facts in this subreddit unfortunately.
707,"Honestly, this sub is contributing to a lot of mental health issues for these people."
708,It’s not healthy to be so doom and gloom all the time.
709,Fixating on the worse of the worse covid cases and letting that frame your worldview.
710,I just saw one today for NM 7k a week ICU but you have to work a 60 hour week.
711,Are you suggesting that the nurses are actually getting the protective gear they need now?
712,I live in Bismarck.
713,People here still call it the “Plandemic” and say it will go away once Trump leaves office??
714,There is a city wide mandate to wear masks that was implemented just a few weeks ago.
715,But no one wears them because there are no repercussions if you don’t.
716,Why do Minnesotans always bring up Wisconsin when talking about Minnesota?
717,We get it.
718,We have more lakes and a better NFL team.
719,"We're all super fucked from COVID though, so I guess we have that in common."
720,These hospital CEOs are atrocious.
721,Do you know that if you get sick with covid likely *from work* that you must report it to employee health and the attendance policy is still enforced.
722,Meaning that we still accrue occurrences that can result in disciplinary action all because we take care of the sickest patients.
723,It is disgusting
724,All I've read is some guy got it twice and the second time was asymptomatic.
725,Both my dad and brother have it right now.
726,It's just like a regular flu for them thankfully.
727,What is operation warp speed?
728,Political games.
729,Researchers said that the incident was not related to the vaccine.
730,&gt;The strains that become less deadly aren't an issue.
731,The issue is the virus mutating in a way that leads to increased transmission or severity at a time when the system is already overwhelmed.
732,Another 1% of people becoming seriously ill doesn't sound like a big deal but that could be the straw that broke the camels back in areas like North Dakota where they are already at capacity.
733,"At that time scale, no."
734,You seem to be very doom and gloom about things completely beyond our control.
735,"Let me burst your bubble:  
People die every day."
736,Viruses kill people every day.
737,Novel viruses come around every day.
738,"The flu and the common cold might have had the exact same impact on early man as you describe in the latter part of your post, we will adapt to the new standards and the new humans after a few generations will live under the circumstances of their life."
739,That is what evolution under pressure is.
740,"That is exactly how humanity ""as a whole species"" will survive COVID."
741,"Death is tragic, but its also just another statistic."
742,"Live your life, be happy, contribute, accept that death happens to everyone."
743,Do you have more info on this?
744,First I've heard of it.
745,"&gt;This is literally what we do in here, every day."
746,"We debate and disagree, with our intellects."
747,You forgot to say that you also downvote *anyone* saying *anything* critical about Sweden.
748,Hope they can get by on those margins!
749,Not saying they’re lying about it.
750,I’m saying exceptions do not make the rule.
751,There are always outliers in data.
752,"Not all immune systems work the same, and some people likely do not produce a robust immune response to create long-lasting immunity, but most likely do."
753,That’s what the data shows us so far.
754,A single anecdote is not a study.
755,We should trust the CDC and other scientific institutions on this.
756,"If they gather enough data that says otherwise, I’ll adjust my POV, but until then, we should trust their direction."
757,It's not about a lobby.
758,It's about if Denmark is a democracy ruled by laws or not
759,All those involved in the worldwide effort to stop this virus will never get the full thank you and credit they deserve but I'm just glad that we have a light at the end of the tunnel and even if I don't know the names of all the companies and people every single one has my thanks
760,"I've taken all kinds of vaccines, including some that are not typically needed in the developed world."
761,"(I doubt that most of you have been vaccinated for typhoid or yellow fever, as I have.)"
762,But all of them took years to develop.
763,None of them were launched after only a few months of clinical trials that typically take a year or more performed in succession instead of simultaneously.
764,None of them were developed in a climate of intense politicization or fear of a public reaction if there is no vaccine.
765,"And no, I don't think that COVID-19 was cooked up in a Chinese lab."
766,Complete nonsense.
767,That's interesting!
768,"I dont know this guy's story, I'm in the upper midwest."
769,Bedford.
770,Bedford Hills.
771,Prison.
772,"I think they said it only needs to be super cooled with dry ice during transport, once it's in a regular freezer it lasts like 5 days, and with the demand I don't think you'll see much of it going bad."
773,Every major company on earth that can help will all pitch in on this.
774,Once we control COVID we can start building the economy again.
775,oop lmao
776,lol I love the guy but why is this being posted?
777,I thought we only allowed high quality articles.
778,Who cares what Dr Fauci eats.
779,Dude I work in the parcel handling industry.
780,Properly packed in dry ice they will be fine for 24 hours or more of transport.
781,"I agree with you 100%, I think they just got the idea that you were anti-fauci from the first comment which is why they downvoted"
782,"I'm with you, friend."
783,It blows my mind how everyone seems to be fine with eating reaturant food.
784,"Obviously takeout is going to be ""safer"" than dining in (which would be ridiculous), but it's still far from a nonzero chance that transmission would occur, either to the consumer or between employees."
785,"And yet every time I drive my mother around for an errand, I have to listen to her say, ""honey why can't we go drive-thru somewhere?"""
786,"I wonder if everywhere gets hit a little harder when it gets cold (people want to do things indoors), but if there's something about Hokkaido that makes them generally a little higher than the rest of Japan."
787,"Combined, those effects might produce a noticeable swing, because of the nature of exponentials?"
788,My local restaurant has a kick-ass macaroni and cheese with grilled chicken and peppers.
789,Biontech has a new plant with a yearly capacity of 700 million doses iirc.
790,It was on their twitter recently
791,I’m speaking about inside.
792,Usually at least 5 people in there + employees and no one is wearing masks
793,Please provide any source that takeout is a source of infection.
794,"In my city delivery has skyrocketed for obvious reasons (delivery services are also way more common here due to small cities/easy to cycle, which they usually do)



So even though delivery has skyrocketed by a lot we havent heard of any outbreak happening from that."
795,So if you could provide a source thatd be nice
796,Let's called it BioNizer
797,Mcdonald's is racist af.
798,"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/09/01/mcdonalds-franchisees-discrimination-lawsuit/

&gt; 52 former franchisees accuse McDonald’s of racial discrimination in lawsuit
The complaint alleges the fast-food giant intentionally placed Black franchise owners in economically depressed markets and set them up for failure"
799,It kind of pisses me off.
800,I've been home since March.
801,I've done some hiking and solo stuff.
802,"I've had 3 ""gatherings"" all year, and those were 20 people, 6 people and 16 people."
803,"Every time I went to a ""gathering"", I quarantined for 14 days after."
804,I've wondered if im crazy.
805,"I know i might be going crazy from it, but....am I?"
806,I dont feel like I'm not free or rights have been taken away.
807,"I'm social, I love parties and concerts."
808,I just don't want this virus or the flu or anything else for that matter.
809,And now we have higher numbers again.
810,"I dont know what the solution is, but I dont want to be part of the problem."
811,Lots of pasta dishes reheat nicely.
812,In my opinion almost anything where the entire dish is hot reheats well - Chinese food with a lot of good options.
813,"We can see this as if looking into the future, we can see the counter measures that have been proven to work but still, we have to learn the hard way that what is happening there will happen here."
814,"A good person learns from their mistakes, a better person learns from other people's mistakes."
815,And so many gonna write Never forget evey year on 9/11.
816,But can't wear a mask when we've had 80 9/11s worth of death.
817,"We should definitely protect him, since people have sent threats towards him and his family."
818,Still can’t get over the fact that people did that
819,It's politics more than money.
820,Elections in Denmark next year.
821,Politicians are busy trying to show the voters they are doing the right thing.
822,This is the surge from the The Sturgis motorcycle rally a ways back.
823,"500,000 ~~attendees~~ absolute fucking morons, 50% infection rate."
824,"Then they scattered back through all those states, and here we are."
825,Really concerned that once people hear the elderly are vaccinated that period will just straight away go back to normal without realizing it's a two step vaccination with immunity coming a month later and just because some at-risk are getting vaccinated doesn't mean everyone or even most are.
826,This is starting to really look like a messaging disaster IMO.
827,"If people hear ""some of those at-risk begin the month-long process of vaccination in December"" people are gonna hear ""Covid is over in December""."

834,i think it's a bit disingenuous to compare universities that basically went totally online vs those that opted to have the vast majority of their student body return.
835,"Obviously, the latter group made the wrong decision given the Fall Surge, but I would be more interested in knowing more about successful mitigation programs of colleges that have resumed in-person classes."
836,What are the doing right?
837,Are they conducting regular surveillance testing?
838,Did they convert fields and stadiums to covered lecture halls?
839,Did they ban Greek and club activities this year?
840,"It's not difficult, just time consuming."
841,I work in the bar/restaurant industry and basically every bartender and server is out of a job right now.
842,"If you pivot to take you, you need one person handing out orders, instead of several servers, bartenders, and bussers."
843,"Citywide, that’s a ridiculous amount of jobs."
844,"The bigger problem is that there’s been almost no coordination between the government and the restaurant association, with many times the state says one thing and then changes their mind."
845,When open streets first started all the restaurants put up barricades to expand for outdoor seating.
846,"Then two weeks later, the city released new guidelines on what was required for those barricades and everyone had to tear down and start again."
847,It’s been a complete shit show.

902,"Not from Fauci, but I've read interviews with other health experts who've talked about the low risk of covid transmission via food."

937,What is your point exactly?
938,The Chinese government slaughtered thousands of innocent people in the streets in 1989.
939,Should people not get China’s vaccine to avoid giving the CCP good publicity?
940,Well 40 million people losing pre existing condition coverage is going to break insurance
941,Especially once Biden is in office and uses the defense production act.

951,they can become infected but it’ll be a mild infection.
952,the death rate will plummet for even the most at risk groups.
953,you see the same exact thing with the flu vaccine.
954,even if you still get the flu it’s a lot less severe and you’re only sick for a few days rather than 2 weeks.
955,No kidding.

982,I'm just jaded from the lackluster response in the US.
983,I’m not really sure what their qualms are?
984,Are all scientific breakthroughs negated by the amount of time it took to develop them?
985,Just because something was done faster doesn’t mean it’s not safe or valid.
986,"Most vaccines take a long time to develop due to relevancy, funding issues and trials do normally take longer, however; scientists can usually have like a 99% certainty rate on how safe/effective a vaccine will be within the first year."
987,There is no way Denmark will test the whole population and sequence every single test.

1045,"Explosion= Release of energy(the thing you see)+shockwave(blast)

The release of energy in size would be the rapid growth of infections."
1046,The total carnage means people drop dead on the street like in Italy during the first wave.
1047,It means the infection rate got so high that it would be like seeing the release of energy of an H-Bomb close by you try to run away(trying to do something against the pandemic when it's too late) but the shockwave gets you ands burns you alive.
1048,Italy had some regions which were overwhelmed and it was really cruel to see recordings people dropping dead on the streets doctors having to deceided who gets a ventilator and who gets sedated so he doesn't suffer too much dying.
1049,Even if it's just 1% death rate you have to consider if everybody in the USA gets infected that's 3.3million deaths.
1050,Then there are 10% serious cases that's 33million with unpredictable aftereffects.
1051,Let's say one third dies to the next cold or dies because their life expectation got shortened by a lot.
1052,That's 11million more deaths in a short timeframe.
1053,Added up that's 14.3 million deaths because of Covid and that example is an ideal scenario where the health care system isn't overwhelmed.
1054,An overwhelmed health care system adds quiet a few hospitalisation level cases without a ventilator to the list of serious/deadly cases because it's left untreated.
1055,Without taking action the pandemic can become more ugly than the Spanish flu just because everybody can become asympomatic.

1066,I have no idea why you think it is.
1067,"There are plenty of doctor jobs in non-rural areas - it’s not a matter of “take the rural job or take nothing.” 

Rural areas have to incentivize this, and they’ve done it in various ways."
1068,"Several rural states (Kansas and a few others) have Rural Doctors Programs, where the state pays off a certain portion of med school loan debt in exchange for doctors agreeing to work in rural areas for a certain number of years."
1069,Specific rural hospitals have sometimes worked to raise money to provide incentives for doctors.
1070,But it’s not a “here or nothing” deal.
1071,Lots of doctors will sign on with Weatherby or Vista or another locum staffing company and bounce around various locum gigs before they agree to a really rural gig.

1338,He is trying to ensure if it’s made in America that it isn’t American Healthcared which will kill thousands more.
1339,&gt;Even Dr Fauci is waiting for FDA's approval rather than jumping to get it.
1340,"Can you describe a way one would get this vaccine otherwise, if you were not in the trial?"
1341,It's not like they set up hotdog carts full of vaccines before the FDA approves it.
1342,We really feel for the people living in parts of the world where Covid has taken hold.
1343,What a disaster.
1344,My friends following the data gave up with test numbers.
1345,It makes no sense anymore.
1346,Now we're relying on death numbers but even that is messy because they count and report separately hospital and care centers deaths.
1347,Some days we have close to 1000 and others close to 500.
1348,Today I believe 800 deaths were reported.
1349,"If a person chooses not to get the vaccine, that’s on them."
1350,We aren’t going to permanently live with masks and social distancing just to placate anti vaxxers.

1353,Taking the comfort I can in knowing the 🍊🥔 is on his way out and our new leader was being briefed on the pandemic before he was even declared the winner.
1354,Hearing him say their plan was to listen to the scientists brought a fucking legit tear to my eye.
1355,I'm not sure why.
1356,My company plans on keeping a good chunk of us at home even when this is all over.
1357,It's become apparent asses in seats is an old school way of thinking and no longer required.
1358,"Hooray, ifr is now 0.5 instead of 0.6 % :P"
1359,I believe Biden and Harris mentioned implementing a financial transaction tax to help offset the costs of this year.
1360,"Fortunately, FTT wouldn't directly tax the average person."
1361,"However, I am sure corporations will figure out how to trickle that down to us."
1362,"I’m pretty sure Will Smith has never pulled a tooth, but I’m also not that close to Will Smith so I guess it’s possible."
1363,I think they're counting the other person's arm too.
1364,"Approximately 420,000 Americans died in the 5 years of WW2."
1365,Over 50% of that figure dead in the US in less than a year and it still appears people aren’t taking it seriously?
1366,"Don't know if anyone has mentioned Michigan yet, but we're a hot mess."
1367,"From being one of the worst in the country at the beginning, to getting down to just under 200 cases statewixe per day back in June, to now where were seeing an average of 4000 cases per day, sometimes 5000 or 6000."
1368,Everythings rising and many people are no longer taking things seriously.
1369,"A lot of the whole ""I'm sick of dealing with all this covid business, I can't stop living my life"" bullshit."
1370,"Jam packed restaurants that are definitely at 100% capacity, parties every weekend, everyone going to crowded places all the time."
1371,A lot of no social distancing going on for sure.
1372,"I'm glad I live in an area where most people are wearing masks, but some still aren't and SOOOO many people have their noses out."
1373,"🙄🙄🙄

I'm being as careful as I can, but I've already been exposed once (was negative thankfully) and I know it's only a matter of time before I accidentally get exposed again thru family or something."
1374,It's a really scary time and I wish that people would just take things more seriously.
1375,"You’re an anti vaxxer if the FDA were to approve it but you don’t take it, even without comment from Dr. Fauci."
1376,I don't think I have a health minister.
1377,I do not know what worldmeters did with the backlogs; they don't seem to show those nor do they have the bulk testing numbers from Slovakia.
1378,In this case it is the war for drugs :)
1379,Not in this you are either pro vaccine or you are pro people dying there is no in between.
1380,Some things are black and white and trying to say there is grey is a classic antivaxxer yactic
1381,Pfizer is producing it in Belgium already.
1382,Lockdowns don’t work
1383,I hope you remember your flippant attitude and glib comments like this when someone you love ends up in the hospital or dead because of your recklessness.
1384,"Behaving like that, it’ll only be a matter of time I’m sure."
1385,"The saddest part is that it doesn’t have to be that way, but it will be because of a choice you consciously made."
1386,"I would call you ignorant, but you actually have access to all the information you need to make the correct decisions and still choose not to."
1387,So I guess that just makes you an idiot.
1388,3/42 is a lot of infections no matter how you count it.
1389,"Either there's a massive outbreak going on there, or these people somehow thought they were immune and started treating patients with no PPE, or you're more vulnerable to infection for the several weeks after vaccination."
1390,Same.
1391,So could this mRNA mean curing the common cold or herpes or aids etc?
1392,C'mon man get off your high horse.
1393,I live in a tiny cramped apartment with neighbors where I can't be doing super intense impact workouts.
1394,"Besides that, for some of us exercise is a crucial way to relieve stress/anxiety, something that's at an all-time high in 2020."
1395,"Sure I could go for a run in the summer, but soon it'll be below freezing where I live."
1396,"My gym requires masks (and unlike a restaurant you can actually keep your mask on the entire time while working out), temperature checks at the door, gives everyone a spray bottle and wipes to clean equipment after use, has set up air filtration systems on every floor, and I go during the lunch hour where there's maybe 15-20 people in the entire three-floor gym."
1397,"Sure, a lot of gyms aren't going that far, but it's borderline rude to throw around that much attitude to anyone who's just trying to exercise."
1398,I also talked to my gym's manager the other day and since they reopened in August he hasn't had a single member notify him that they've contracted covid.
1399,"Even he was surprised by that, but it goes to show how effective masks and common sense can be in just about any setting."
1400,It also just depends on where you live.
1401,"Everyone around here is super compliant when it comes to mask-wearing, even when outdoors so people generally aren't reckless."
1402,No lol
1403,Are they getting paid or something?
1404,Why are they so obsessed?
1405,You know America is still on it’s first wave right?

1534,"I am not a scientist and only interested in the concept of mRNA vaccine (which is why I follow BioNTech's progress a bit), well, mostly I want to know what solution for the pandemic could look like when I discovered the concept of mRNA vaccine."
1535,There was a [press release](https://investors.biontech.de/news-releases/news-release-details/pfizer-and-biontech-announce-early-positive-update-german-phase/) from BioNTech which mentions it.
1536,"&gt;All subjects in the prime-boost cohorts, except for two at the lowest dose level, had CD4+ T cell responses."
1537,Cytokine profiling of the RBD-specific CD4+ T cells demonstrated a TH1-dominant profile for these cells.
1538,"29 of the 36 tested subjects also mounted an RBD-specific functional, **CD8+ T cell response that was comparable to memory responses** observed against cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein Barr virus (EBV) and **influenza virus**."
1539,"&gt;Overall, the data suggested that BNT162b1 could potentially be administered safely, with a manageable tolerability profile."
1540,"**Local reactions and systemic events after injection with BNT162b1 at all dose levels were transient, generally mild to moderate, with occasional severe events (Grade 3) of flu-like symptoms and injection site reactions**."
1541,All adverse events resolved spontaneously and were managed with simple measures.
1542,"No serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported, and there were no withdrawals due to adverse events related to the vaccine."
1543,I can't tell you much about the functioning of the immune system.
1544,BNT says it comes from a memory effect from the body when the T-Cells get created.
1545,You will most likely need an actual Scientist for the answer.
1546,"I never thought much after reading TH1, CD4 or CD8 and just thought it is okay as long as they have an explanation."

1557,"&gt; First of all, the vaccine is not 100% effective."
1558,"So if you infect a few thousand, a hundred or more people may still get COVID and a few might actually die."
1559,It's hard to justify that.
1560,"Except you're going to give the vaccine to hundreds of millions, with the premise it will protect them."
1561,"So many tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands will be exposed to the virus, likely because they will throw caution to the wind (ie no mask, social distancing, etc) thinking they're safe."
1562,Isn't that worse?
1563,I'm just saying that making bold claims of 90% effectiveness based on a small sample size statistically in a randomized trial is dangerous.
1564,I have asthma  so I'm worried about ramifications from that
1565,I posted this somewhere else.
1566,Did a bunch of research on it.
1567,"TLDR: there are documented cases, although it appears rare at this point."
1568,"Main concerns are: how long does immunity last (unlikely to be forever since it's an RNA virus (these mutate way more than DNA viruses, but could become immune maybe in certain people), could you get sicker if get a second time (maybe?)"
1569,and are there different strains (appears to be but thankfully as of now they don't seem to be extremely different.
1570,"--------------------------------------------------------
Certainly seems like it's happening, albeit at this point is relatively rare."
1571,The concern regards the further out we get (especially before a vaccine comes); does COVID itself mutate more or does our immunity wane at some point?
1572,Some viruses like smallpox give lifelong immunity after having it.
1573,Given COVID-19 is a novel virus we don't know enough yet.
1574,"Along those lines, admitting that we don't know enough yet, anecdotally from speaking to some physicians and reading the literature, there might be a chance that if you had a very mild infection initially it could portend a chance of having a more serious infection if get a second time (the recent case of a 25 year old Nevada man being hospitalized on oxygen after the second infection being an example)."
1575,"However, given the paucity of a significant volume of data it's hard to determine that."
1576,COVID is an RNA virus (other type of viruses are DNA); RNA viruses are inherently more prone to mutations.
1577,"While thankfully it doesn't seem like COVID has mutated to a more lethal disease, it does seem to have different variants that are pretty similar but have slight differences (not necessarily important as of now it seems of the symptoms one may lead to, moreso that it could make you more susceptible to reinfection if get a different variant after a first infection)."
1578,"Notably, HIV is an RNA virus and there is a small subset of people ~10% that are completely immune to it."
1579,"""A study posted September 28 to medRxiv confirms four reinfections in Qatar using genetic sequencing data that found distinct viral variants between the first and second infections."""
1580,"Have spoken to a few physician colleagues and they've personally seen instances (although not a ton) of people re-infected with COVID (eg a positive test, separated by negative tests and then a period of weeks or more likely months later another positive test with symptoms)."
1581,"Published in The Lancet, a top medical journal."
1582,"""The patient had two positive tests for SARS-CoV-2, the first on April 18, 2020, and the second on June 5, 2020, separated by two negative tests done during follow-up in May, 2020."

1614,"Granted, most places have longer wait times, but it’s possible she had no reason to suspect covid."
1615,I just do not understand how wearing a mask infringes on your freedom?
1616,"The mask mandate in my state makes it so I can do all the things I normally did- shop, gas up, eat at restaurants."
1617,Things don't need to totally shut down because enough people are following logical precautions.
1618,"I will miss eating inside restaurants as it gets colder and less outdoor eating becomes available, but they will be keeping most of the outside dining with heaters."
1619,But freedom?
1620,I feel pretty free with all this healthy breathing and mask-wearing.

1631,If you work in healthcare you can probably find a job basically anywhere.
1632,Not just in ND.
1633,"Wife’s an icu nurse in central Ohio, they are flirting with full beds everyday, in both icu units for the past three weeks."
1634,Frustrating to hear that is how ND is handling the problem.
1635,People who don’t wear seatbelts constantly are a rust to other people.

1642,Tbh our school system sucks.
1643,It's designed to push kids through into the work force.
1644,Even college didn't help me prepare for the real world really outside of a select few 300-400 classes.
1645,That combined with the access to a wide variety of information on the internet and the inability to separate suggests and proves.
1646,You now have an average American.
1647,Classic bullshit.
1648,The pre fusion stabilized spike is the same spike sequence wise as any other configuration of the spike.

1650,48 degrees right now in hollywood with a high of 66.

1662,"There's a detail being missed in the responses to this which I think is important to note, which is that many older people do not have access to the technology required to actually see a loved one's face in isolation."
1663,"In the UK [about 20% of retired people do not use the internet](https://www.ageing-better.org.uk/digital-inclusion), and it appears to be [a bit lower](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/internet-broadband/) in the USA."

1665,I think it is easy to not realise this as an internet user because it's become so normal to the rest of us.
1666,"This also isn't solvable just by giving older people the hardware needed to get online, it's also a skills/confidence issue for many."
1667,"I mention this because I think although it's still a complex problem to solve, it's a hell of a lot simpler than the public health side, and we aren't even currently reaching a baseline where everyone *can* get online if they want to."

1680,"My hospital didn’t even give us N95s, just surgical masks."
1681,"And this was not remotely a rural hospital, very much in a major city."
1682,True wokeness
1683,Only 2-3 percent require hospitalization.
1684,How do you take those numbers and get a 10 percent death rate?
1685,Isn’t a 2-3 percent death rate the absolute ceiling if hospitals are overrun?
1686,Indiana is such a shit hole.
1687,My husband is from there.

God also created all of the medical professionals and epidemiologists who say otherwise."
1702,"Then again, god also created the coronavirus."
1703,He does have a wicked sense of humor.
1704,This title is misleading.
1705,It applies that hospitals are at *overall* 100% capacity.
1706,That isnt true.
1707,The state's goal is to maintain a 20% limit of hospitalized people with covid and that is what they are reaching.
1708,There are currently 383 people currently hospitalized with covid in ND.
1709,They dont have a total of 383 beds.
1710,This headline is 100% distilled fearmongering
1711,Exactly.
1712,"Instead of ""no evidence of""s we need ""evidence that it is not""s."
1713,Not to mention the clear rampant propagandism and lack of proper education that leads to people labeling things like wearing a mask as Communist.
1714,It's gotten real bad.
1715,"There's just a solid probably 30% of the country that's completely brainwashed and anti-science to the point where any claim to the contrary is smacked down immediately, and these people have no interest in learning or even hearing out the other argument."
1716,"These are also the people that will refuse to get vaccinated whenever we get one because it's got ""alien DNA that'll make us gay"" or some shit."
1717,"It doesn't sound like a lot, but 30% is a solid 100 million people."
1718,Nearly one out of every 3 people being anti-science is detrimental to society.

1725,"So, now I’m new, don’t know anyone, and can’t go anywhere."
1726,I’m surrounded by asshats that think the election was stolen and that the virus is a hoax.
1727,It's going to take a lot longer to produce 370 million vaccines.
1728,On top of actually getting people to take it.
1729,"I've already seen comments of ""I am not getting it."

1735,"If someone wants to keep working/helping despite being covid positive, they are now allowed to (means shit's real bad)

And iirc the same volunteering was done in e.g."

1737,"If you want to keep working despite being positive with Covid, you CAN work."
1738,"If you keep working with covid, you probably will only be used to treat covid patients."
1739,"I live in MA with nurse friends and family in CT, ME, MA, and RI and not a single one has had covid."
1740,I have heard of nurses getting it.
1741,"Heck, a nurse my mom knows who works in oncology has covid!"
1742,But I know many have been lucky so far.
1743,My mom went to a wedding where the groom had Covid.
1744,"Everyone knew, no one cared."
1745,Wisconsin has same internal announcements but none are public yet.
1746,Pfizer is saying ~50 million doses available by Jan/feb.
1747,Let’s still assume we need two doses to be effective (not yet clear to me).
1748,So we need ~ 700 million doses and we can bump that down a bit to account for herd immunity to  70% vaccination rate to achieve.
1749,So say 500 million doses.
1750,I’m going to assume that Pfizer has been proactively mfg since August and that it takes say 4 months to generate 50 million doses.
1751,So that’s 36 months to make the needed remaining 450 million doses.
1752,Maybe it’s only one dose that’s needed and that’s still a year and a half or not until mid-2022 that we’ve got enough product.
1753,"This is just the US population of course and we have an advantage to achieving immunity because a significant portion of our population has already been exposed, may 25% in some densely populated areas but then you have to account for anti-vax’ers and rate of distribution and an effective rate that may likely go down in non-controlled settings."
1754,All of which will delay the timeline to getting society wide immunity.
1755,I’m not going to be naive and assume by any stretch of the imagination that this product will come solely to the US.
1756,So that really means a date that’s much much farther out for world wide immunity with just this product.
1757,"Frankly speaking, unless they can start generating 50 million doses/day then we are still in for a very very long haul."

1786,Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX) today announced the execution of an agreement with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Defense to meet the U.S. government’s Operation Warp Speed program goal to begin delivering 300 million doses of a vaccine for COVID-19 in 2021.
1787,"Under the agreement, the U.S. government will receive 100 million doses of BNT162, the COVID-19 vaccine candidate jointly developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, after Pfizer successfully manufactures and obtains approval or emergency use authorization from U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)."
1788,This press release features multimedia.
1789,"View the full release here: 

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200722005438/en/

The U.S. government will pay the companies $1.95 billion upon the receipt of the first 100 million doses, following FDA authorization or approval."
1790,The U.S. government also can acquire up to an additional 500 million doses.
1791,Americans will receive the vaccine for free consistent with U.S. government’s commitment for free access for COVID-19 vaccines.
1792,They predict Q1 2021.
1793,Then you don`t care about facts.
1794,I’m not a nurse but I’ve been working on a COVID unit for a few months now.
1795,Now we are all COVID patients.
1796,This isn’t new.
1797,This has been our lives for the past few months.
1798,"Now all the nurses are leaving for better jobs, and travel nurses are in short supply."
1799,They are expecting our numbers to double in the next few weeks but we don’t know where to put the patients or who will take care of them.
1800,And We’ve already had our raises held this year and no 401k matches.
1801,I wish I didn’t go into healthcare.
1802,"From what I understand, the Federal government mandates that cars have seatbelts."
1803,The States then have seatbelt laws.
1804,"These laws vary between States (e.g., NY just started requiring backseat passengers to wear seatbelts, but other states may already be there, or may not require that)."
1805,Most people find a false sense of security in the high survival rate.

1809,They were all told to prepare themselves and the families for the certainty that they would shortly get the virus.

1970,Not to mention all the people who still believe that covid isn't real or that they don't need a vaccine for it.
1971,No u
1972,I believe a big part of the resistance to lockdown is a feeling this is overhyped.

2009,Ever.
2010,And like I said in my post a couple weeks ago our numbers are going up and up.
2011,We went from 10-15 new cases a day to 70+ cases.
2012,The two schools involved in the homecomings are now closed due to so many people being out.
2013,They said yesterday there are too many to contact trace.
2014,"They, once again, are coming close to the guidelines for moving to virtual learning."
2015,"However, the last two times we were nearing that line, they changed the reporting metrics rather than move to virtual."
2016,"Our little hospital has long been sending people to Nashville and according to what I read yesterday, Nashville is starting to not look too good on the hospital front."
2017,My little county is not the only one with a hospital sending people to Nashville.
2018,"In short, give it some time and we're going to be a hot mess."
2019,A hotter mess.
2020,I would be too.
2021,Lots of people that are perfectly healthy have been short of breath afterward and not able to take full breaths after minor amounts of exercise.
2022,I can say that in the ICU none of my really bad patients have been asthmatics.
2023,So some very slight reassurance.
2024,:( best of luck out there and stay safe.
2025,"Not trying to get all your hopes up, but I also remember Moderna’s CEO saying that they expect their vaccine efficacy rate to be high too."
2026,I’m hoping multiple vaccines can reach Pfizer’s level.

2029,They're hopeless

2048,This is a good way to kill nurses...and to make sure no other nurses ever work in your state again.
2049,"Like, how fucking STUPID is this governor?"
2050,Pretty much.
2051,Seasonality is the single biggest factor in all of this.
2052,Not lockdowns or masks or curfews or standing on your head
2053,"To be honest,   yes."
2054,"""Conformist"" isn't a terribly inaccurate term."
2055,There was a new jacket that was in style a few years back and I remember going into a coffee shop and seeing like 20 people all wearing the same exact jacket in the same exact color and my father who was visiting at the time asked me if they were employees or if that was a uniform or something... it wasn't...

2102,That makes a lot of sense for a fire.

I wonder what we can learn from that"
2118,Sadly this is already occurring.
2119,There was a bill passed where healthcare workers were not required to be paid for quarantining.
2120,Also we’re heavily guilted about it as well.

2147,"The social contract is a philosophical myth, not an objective thing that we all agree exists."
2148,Even less likely that people who agree that any such implicit contract exists also agree on the terms.

2160,"You’re not thinking about AZ, Novavax, J&amp;J, Moderna, Sanofi....

You’re also assuming there’s no ramp up in production between now and then.....

You’re also assuming that other countries in the world are producing their own vaccines and will likely be covering their own countries and surrounding countries (Russia, India, China).. and that these places cover most of the words population."
2161,"You also don’t account for therapeutics that exist and are successful in getting people better, like regeneron and Lilly, to supplement those that do get sick....

2269,"Well at the rate of how deaths are going, a lot fewer vaccines are going to be needed pointstohead.jpg"
2270,They use statistical calculations to figure out a minimum data pool for reliable results.
2271,100 people is not a big pool for infection rates (but it is useful for something like testing a rare-cancer drug).
2272,"40,000 is plenty large enough for an infectious disease."
2273,The main purpose of a trial like this is to prove a vaccine reduces infection and/or severity in the general population.
2274,In addition to catching any severe side effects that may not have occurred in smaller trials.
2275,"If you have 20k people get a placebo, and 20k people get the vaccine, randomized and double blinded so not even the docs administering shots know who got what, you then track who gets Covid-19."
2276,Say you find 100 cases in a couple months 10 from the vaccine pool and 90 fom the placebo pool.
2277,(They test everyone to catch even asymptomatic cases).
2278,It’s obvious then that the vaccine is preventing a significant number of infections.
2279,"If 1 out of 10 of the infections in the vaccine group were severe, and 25 out of 90 of the placebo infections were severe, that would also indicate that the vaccine reduces severity in addition to preventing infection."
2280,"The vaccine may turn out to be more or less effective in various populations, or different age categories,  or among people with specific health conditions, but that’s the kind of thing you use larger studies for."
2281,For general effectiveness you can use a smaller pool.
2282,Life threatening?

2423,The same vaccine that MSM was blasting as fake Trump propaganda and spreading fear about taking it........ literally being antivax because it was created during a Trump presidency.
2424,"That's for 1 vaccine, Moderna J&amp;J and Oxford all will be coming out soon after Pfizer does."
2425,They need to build multiple manufacturing facilities instead of one big one.
2426,Would make transport easier

2467,ABC News talked about this possible vaccine.
2468,Best case scenario is that around 850 million people are inoculated by the end of 2021.
2469,Earth population?
2470,7.6 billion people.
2471,That means it would take 8.94 years to inoculate just the world at 2020 population levels.
2472,"&gt;Depending on who ""we"" is, maybe... but the world as a whole, and places like the US that don't really have things anywhere close to under control... not unless you mean Spring 2022 (or later), or that masks and distancing will be considered ""normal"" by spring."

2955,We had to shut for 8 weeks.
2956,Being able to continue to pay everyone $750 a week (pre tax) ensured that everyone was able to get through it and be ready to return on the other side.
2957,We have been back to work for about 6 weeks now and are still receiving a reduced version of the scheme to subsidise wages while we recover.
2958,We also received payroll tax relief.
2959,"While the payments were less than most peoples wages, there were other ways people were able to make it last such as rent relief and mortgage freezes for up to six months if you needed it."

3070,They dont know yet.
3071,Tests so far just show that people with the vaccine were much less likely to be tested positive for covid.
3072,That means they were less definitely likely to get sick but it's not clear if that was because the vaccine stopped the virus entirely (so non transmissable) or because it just stopped it from making people ill (still allowing asymptomatic transmission).
3073,It will almost certainly reduce transmission as well as illness but it is too early to say by how much

3154,"The long term effects of the virus that we know about already mean that we have to be a lot more careful than we are with the flu so it will be recommended to always have a mask and sanitiser with you so it can be utilised in places where effective social distancing isn't possible such as public transport and busy centres but you'll be able to socialise without too many issues, so long as hygiene is strongly considered."
3155,On the bright side we will see the measures that we use to control the spread of covid also have an effect against other illnesses including the cold and flu as well as bacterial illnesses as well so it's not all bad news.
3156,It's an adjustment but people are nothing if not adaptable.

its a public service and they have an obligation to take you where you want to go, otherwise taxis would pick and chose and you end up with a high concentration in high turnover areas which leaves other places under serviced."
3190,I did a quick calculation on how the vaccine distribution process could and should be affected by age.
3191,It's not exactly shocking information that the virus affects older people more than younger people.
3192,[Here's](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm) a break down of the deaths by age group.
3193,What I think a lot of people under appreciate is how small of a target this gives us compared to an incredibly large amount of its potential harm reduction.
3194,Let's start from the group that has the highest absolute value of deaths- 65 to 74- and count upward.
3195,We're talking about people 65 and up.
3196,"That group represents 171,814 of the recorded 217,348 deaths: **79.05%**."
3197,"That age group also has 54,058,236 people in the United States- well, assuming they haven't been discounted from the tally after dying- out of the population of 328,239,523: **16.47%**."
3198,The quick and dirty version of this is that vaccinating around 16% of the population would prevent around 79% of deaths.
3199,That's a pretty good deal.
3200,"I don't know who's gonna be distributing the vaccines- it might come down to the states or the federal government, and they might start being given out under Trump and continue to be distributed under Biden- but I will say that I think a massive focus needs to be given on the elderly, after health care workers of course, as the CDC has already advised."
3201,"Other than people with pre existing conditions, I'm going to be a little concerned if we see young people getting the vaccine before every elderly American who wants it has gotten it."
3202,"It might be a little sadistic, but I see this as a numbers game first."
3203,"Making someone over 65 immune is, again by a quick and dirty calculation, almost *five times as likely* to prevent a death as immunizing someone under 65."
3204,That's a huge deal.
3205,"Again, I'm not blowing anyone's mind and I'm sure the well qualified experts making decisions about this have already considered this kind of outlook."
3206,"I guess my point is two fold: It's a great idea to immunize the elderly as early as possible, and no one should be upset when it comes out that young people won't be getting the vaccine for some time after the elderly."

3239,there might me 100 infected people within the placebo group but only 10 infected people from the vaccine group: i.e.
3240,"the statistical conclusion is that around 90 infections from 100 possible were prevented, so it's 90% effective"
3241,No it can’t.
3242,"Will probably involve appointments for vaccination or massive first come, first serve lines..."
3243,"Well, safety data is all the people who didn’t get sick who got the vaccine."

3253,"If the police enforce trespassing on the people who won’t mask up to go into grocery stores, or the state/county/city puts into place a mask ordinance I’ll be 100% on board if only for looks, but until then it’s a no from me."
3254,"&gt; Summer '21 gonna be lit

Sure hope you're right."
3255,I still see a challenge here if we have to vaccinate hundreds of millions if not billions of people.
3256,Also Pfizer’s vaccine needs a boost shot after 28 days so that complicates it even more.

3267,Easy to say until you need a hospital bed or a ventilator.
3268,Both sides should be held accountable.
3269,Both should be open to criticism.
3270,"I’m all for marching for your rights, but this is incredibly shortsighted."
3271,More vaccines for people who will contribute to society then.
3272,Unlike you.
3273,I imagine they will get the virus.
3274,It says 90% effective doesn't mean 90% safe (surely it will be way higher % safe...)
3275,[removed]
3276,What's the number lightly symptomatic?
3277,Through mask usage we may have inoculated lots of people by getting them exposed to very light viral loads.
3278,We  never did get good data on the distribution  for Covid at various viral loads and ages.

3290,Turns out the vaccine is bleach.
3291,Trump was right all along.
3292,Trump was even saying during the debates the vaccine would be ready in a couple weeks lmao no conspiracy here
3293,There’s no way anyone could have known anything for sure until the trial was unblinded.
3294,All the worlds canned meat comes from like 3 giant warehouses and we all can go buy some spam.
3295,ship it to hormel and let them distribute it
3296,Tampa here confirming that’s true.
3297,"Nearly all the signs are gone; those little floor stickers placed 6ft apart are gone; masks are gone...

My Grandmama’s home finally opened up to visitors after 7+ months."
3298,They were very careful and diligent... screening everyone... limiting visiting hours and number of people... they even had a mandatory class every prospective visitor was required to take.
3299,The waiting list was so long but I was able to finally register for this Saturday morning 9am.
3300,Someone brought Covid in this week and they’ve shut down again indefinitely.
3301,"This is my big complaint - and while it’s so important to me, I know I’m one of the truly lucky ones."
3302,This will never end as long as people continue to be careless.
3303,"Guys, please!"
3304,Come on!
3305,!
3306,Yeah this isn’t uncommon in the pharmaceutical industry.
3307,Plenty of companies outsource the production and distribution of drugs they discover and develop processes for all the time.
3308,It is even more appropriate in this situation because of the need to mass produce and distribute as many doses as possible around the world.
3309,"Also, BioNtech and Pfizer have done business in the past (or might still have a partnership I’m not sure), so they already have a relationship."
3310,It’s not like Pfizer is stealing this vaccine by any means.
3311,"For anyone wondering, the article mainly talks about the cryologistical challenges of the -70 celsius storage requirement."
3312,And New Year’s Eve.
3313,And New Year’s Day.
3314,Yoo whoever the player is of plague.inc atm is killin’ it.
3315,Though it’s obvious they’re playing on easy mode.
3316,That’s obviously false.
3317,Lots of time on your hands to harass people on every sub from 90 Day Fiancé to Coronavirus.
3318,Sheesh.
3319,"""No more brunch!"
3320,No more sportsball!
3321,"Do you want to kill Aunt Martha?"""
3322,There's 350 some million Americans alone.
3323,The logistics to mass immunize people are tremendous.
3324,"You need the vaccine, the storage, the transport, the sharps, the gloves, the disposal."
3325,6 months would be incredibly fast.
3326,"Our ceremony is outdoors (we’re in the south so cold weather isn’t normally an issue in Feb), reception is at the same venue so people can be outdoors for that if they want to also."
3327,"The venue can hold 3x the number of guests we have, so there will be room for spacing tables at dinner."
3328,"We’re not doing a seating chart, so people can sit with people they feel comfortable sitting with, whether that’s family they know have been very careful or with people they already hang out with often anyway."
3329,"All staff will be masked, guests can wear masks if they want to."
3330,"If someone doesn’t feel comfortable coming, we’re making it clear that’s fine, we don’t want anyone to feel guilted into coming if they’re concerned about the virus."
3331,"Obviously it’s still a risk and in an ideal world we could postpone, but since there are no restrictions in my state, my parents are out tens of thousands of dollars if we do so, and I don’t want to make that call for them."

3333,Group A has spent 50 years incentivizing a generation of brain drain from Group B.
3334,"And when Group B's smartest people develop a world-saving vaccine using resources from Group A, talking about which group deserves what might give an impression that you're out of your lane."
3335,You're part of the problem...
3336,was gonna say this - dry ice is cheap and effective
3337,&gt; A 2 week hard shut down would help the country tremendously.
3338,"Yes, but how would we get everybody to listen?"
3339,People would be rioting in the streets.
3340,"That might be a good idea in theory, but probably not in practice."
3341,I'm in Daytona.
3342,"I know lots of places still require the sign and ask for masks, but it seems like the majority in but area don't wear it."
3343,BTW they've already found a method they plan on using that allows to transport the vaccines for 10 days at an acceptable temperature
3344,How exactly would a vaccine cause side effects 20 years down the line?
3345,It’s out of your system within weeks after you get it.
3346,The biggest risk is at the time that you get it.
3347,They've already found a method they plan on using that allows to transport the vaccines for 10 days at an acceptable temperature
3348,"He didn't fucking make it, he just moves what needs to be moved."
3349,Eradication won’t happen.
3350,The interesting question is how much help you get from partial immunity in the next 6-18 months before there is a vaccine (that has reached a majority).
3351,"For example, how much does 30% immunity do to the reproduction rate?"
3352,It’s a reduction of R by 30% and likely more.
3353,"The optimistic scenario is that such a level of immunity allows slightly looser restrictions while keeping R below 1, in an area where a naive population would have e.g R=1.4 so exponential growth."
3354,It would be a kind of herd immunity (it’s immunity that drove R below 1) but such a 30% immunity is not a true herd immunity in the normal sense because it’s only working *together with* distancing and other mitigations.
3355,Take away the mitigations and R is above 1.
3356,We were talking about that on WSB today trying to decide which freezer and associated industries we should throw money at.
3357,"Hardly any hospital, let alone a small surgery or pharmacy has got a freezer capable of reaching temperatures of -70 degrees Celsius."
3358,This will be indeed very challenging logistically and I’m afraid we will see a few screwups along the way.
3359,Nobody outside of the clinical trials has been vaccinated and people seem to be as happy as if we already had herd immunity.

3362,Summer '21 gonna be lit
3363,Is Mrs Harris going to let Americans take it or do we have to wait until after inauguration?
3364,"I'm not questioning it, but I also live in florida and almost never see anyone without a mask."
3365,Signs are still up everywhere.
3366,I think it really depends on which part of florida you're in.
3367,Side effect of completely shit state leadership.
3368,"""Only 3,924 cases"" is not a good number."
3369,That is still way too high.
3370,The fact that it is dropping just means lots of other states are doing far worse not that Florida is doing any better.
3371,Hardly anyone I know here is paying any attention to Covid stuff anymore.
3372,This state is so frustrating.
3373,"Bruh this sub only man some of y'all only support figures of authority or scientists when they support your views

And unless Trump is able to meddle with what comes out of warp speed HQ (I hope not and don't think he can) I'll take their word for it"
3374,Funny how they released the ''results'' one week after the elections!
3375,I personally don’t think it’s possible to reduce the number of infections while schools remain open.
3376,A proper lockdown of 2-3 weeks would probably work better and be less harmful than a bunch of half-assed lockdowns in a row.
3377,Stonks!
3378,I know for a fact it infuriated some people that normality by spring/summer is likely now
3379,[removed]
3380,Agreed.
3381,We can't focus on preventing drug deaths by giving direct aid to addicts either.
3382,We instead should prevent the *spread* of drugs by going after cartels and dealers.
3383,That's the real way to deal with drug issues!
3384,They are trying to market Florida for the Holiday Travel season.
3385,Come one come all..... and we will even give you a free gift to take home.
3386,I know like four people traveling to the state in Dec. for the holidays.
