0,Doesnt seem like it and people underestimate how easy this thing spreads.
1,This kind of comparison is so useless.
2,"Your area was not hit as badly as the U.K. was, so maybe you haven’t seen first hand the effects of Covid, and aren’t aware that there is more to be worried about with Covid than just death."
3,"As someone living London, where it’s estimated 1/4 of the population has had Covid in total, I know quite a few people age 20-40 who have been hospitalised and/or have suffered long term side effects."

7,That’s the facts.
8,"&gt; New COVID-19 variants are highly transmissible, with Dr Bloomfield reporting the index case in Victoria's current outbreak caught the virus in a window of 18 seconds."
9,What??
10,Damn.
11,The UK has more vaccines per capita than Canada.
12,If they took the same strategy as Canada they would have more people with first doses.
13,Instead they chose to give more people their second doses.
14,I can't figure out why vaccination rates stated by the CDC don't tally with what's reported on the respective state's Covid dashboards.
15,State reported figures seem to be lower across the board.
16,Anyone have a clue why that's the case?
17,GIVE ME MINE ALREADY!
18,"I'm 18, what do I have, like, 2 months until I get my first jab?"
19,"People who are downvoting you don't know what the situation in India is, or are in denial."
20,"We had plenty of time to be prepared, and in August 2020, Modi announced that the 'Vaccine Rollout plan was ready'

&amp;#x200B;

Vaccines are available for all adults in India *in theory*."
21,"But practically, being able to book a slot for the vaccination is next to impossible."
22,"The vaccine drive is slowly ramping up now, but there is no doubt that we could have achieved a far higher rate of vaccination if we had been more prepared"
23,"Although I agree with you that the tone has changed, this article is light on science and is instead repeating what has been an oft incorrect trope ""just wait two weeks""."
24,"It became an almost rallying cry for people that were trying to justify restrictions, regardless of what the science was saying."
25,It's easier when you don't live alone.

27,"*starts looking for mountains to hike in downtown Toronto*

48,Why is no one in this sub discussing the real substance in his emails?
49,"Mainly that scientists, not conspiracy theorists, have been telling him that this virus could have been engineered?"
50,Not everything has to be political.
51,"I don’t care about Fauci, overall I think he did a great job, but I’m pretty pissed at the incompetence of China most likely letting this virus leak, and for governments and institutions around the world lying to us that there was hardly any possibility it was engineered."
52,This is the straw that should break the camels back of real global sanctions against China.
53,But money talks so nothing will probably happen.
54,Flu transmits differently than coronavirus.
55,Best protection against flu is hand washing/avoiding surfaces that others have touched.
56,"I believe it’s called ‘formites.’   Coronavirus transits primarily through aerosols, not from contact surfaces."
57,Kinda like smoke.
58,"So ventilation is key for corona, hand washing for flu."
59,True.
60,But the issue is that one dose doesn't do much against the Indian variant (the variant that's currently causing the rise in cases there) so most people aren't protected.
61,Got it - so nobody who didn't live through WW2 can complain about anything ever again.
62,Thanks for clarifying!

94,If you’re not aware I suggest you inform yourself.
95,Wait till the UK and Canada open eligibility to the 18-30 age group.
96,"I can see both countries ultimately reaching 80-90% of the population,"
97,When I do the eligibility questionnaire it just says I’m “not in the current phase”.
98,And it’s all very opaque and confusing.
99,I bet a lot of people are just assuming they’re not eligible and that someone will tell them if/when they are.
100,And not realising that they can actually just book an appointment and go.
101,About 11% (15 million+) of visitors to the EU are from the US.

108,"that’s cuz less people are seeing the need to get tested - probably because they are vaccinated , or the virus spread is slower (positivity rate is low )."

110,*cries in Australian*
111,Wondering if we will see a little rebound since it was a holiday weekend.
112,Lots of people traveling and what not  wouldn't want to get the shot around that time
113,This just shows how these vaccines have the potential to completely shut out the virus for all practical purposes if enough people get vaccinated.
114,&gt;US there were plenty of politicians pushing alternative medicine too.
115,There is a difference between few politicians pushing and government officially supporting in the name of culture and heritage.
116,Does this mean the efficacy is 97%?
117,"yea thats kinda the bonus of having such a massive economy, its very diversified so even tho hospitality and tourism got smashed, everything else largely did fine."
118,"that, and due to our taxes, and its why california ended up with a $76 billion budget surplus, while most other states lost billions in tax revenue"
119,I can explain this.
120,The British voted in a Prime Minister who wanted to inject himself with Covid on live TV while people were dying to prove it was a hoax and you voted for Brexit.
121,Italy made mistakes but it was hit hard and early with a new virus while the world was still trying to make sense of it.
122,The reality is that Britain is currently reaping what it sowed.
123,Same here.
124,Coasted through a couple decades without any major colds or flu.
125,Got the flu one year bad to remind me how bad it could be.

148,Compare that to some place like Italy where you weren't allowed to leave your home and if you did you could only do so for exercise and it had to be within a mile of your home and you had to fill out paperwork ahead of time and you could do this once a day.

258,Only 2/3rds of doctors have been vaccinated so far in spite of having exclusive vaccinations for 1 month.

282,I was surprised when I got my first dose 2 weeks ago that the nurse said 92% effective after 2 weeks.
283,"I figure even if that's using a different measure than the 95% figures you see thrown about, that's pretty great."
284,"I have a question, if I am fully vaccinated and donate blood."

292,I have a younger (27) co-worker who basically has said they won’t get the vaccine because “there’s to much conflicting information” since the very beginning.
293,I am fully vaccinated and still wear my mask - something he loves to “call me out” on literally every time we are around each other.
294,We were forced to be in a small conference room together for several minutes a couple of weeks ago.
295,"The next day, he was out."
296,Then he was out the week after that.
297,"Mid way through the next week, he still wasn’t back so I asked where he was, since he wasn’t showing as having requested vacation, etc."
298,"Turns out, he had covid at the time we were in the room together."
299,"He was symptomatic, at work, and it really hit him the day after we had been in the room together."
300,I was 100% exposed and never showed any symptoms - I attribute it to being fully vaccinated and still ardently wearing a mask around non-vaccinated people.
301,"He had a mild case, according to him, but also has made it clear he doesn’t plan to vax because “it wasn’t that bad”."
302,I’ve simply even stopped trying with these people.

314,So this isn't surprising.
315,"To elaborate on that, Missouri only has 42.12% of the population partially vaccinated, while  34.30% fully vaccinated with less than 10,000 vaccines administered in the last 2 days."

337,I've had a couple of reactions to it.
338,"In one case, I think I must have sensed I was coming down with something, and so getting the flu shot came to mind."
339,"Not completely harmless, but you are correct that the first shot carries the biggest risk."
340,"The risk in UK for an AstraZeneca vaccine blood clot has been observed to be 1:118k, more specifically 1:90k for the first dose, and 1:120k for the second dose."
341,Bankrupt them with the medical bills.
342,Stupidity isn’t cheap
343,I would argue that the emotional type is more dangerous because it is more susceptible to act violently when things doesn't go their way (ex : January 6th)...
344,"In King County, 75% of residents 16 years of age and older have received one dose, and 63% are fully vaccinated."
345,"Assuming that the unvaccinated includes also those who got one shot, point efficacy is \~98%."
346,Probably herd effects are at play though.
347,"Again, I got my number from this [article](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.ft.com/content/f12aa466-9cc5-4200-8742-4324d31d4cf0)."
348,"I did not do the exact conversion of euros to dollars, my bad, but I figure by the time we pay for hotel for a ten day quarantine, food, transport, it will be over $1000."

354,Wtf I love sours.
355,"More specifically, lambic style, which is sort of a subset of that type."
356,I guess I just don't understand why or how they know that infected vaccinated people don't spread the disease to unvaccinated people.
357,"I know people who work in medical facilities around me who've told me that employees and patients are going to be required to wear masks regardless of vaccination status for at least the rest of this year, and I've also heard that Pfizer is requiring employees at their facility to do the same."
358,"That doesn't exactly inspire confidence, especially when the CDC's statements about whether or not the vaccine can stop transmission have been kind of tepid, i.e., I haven't heard anyone flat out say ""yes we are confident that vaccinated people don't spread COVID""."
359,"You can't derive efficacy, as the two populations are self selecting."
360,You aren't comparing vaccinated vs unvaccinated.
361,You are comparing people who CHOSE to be vaccinated vs people who chose not to be.
362,So other confounding variables like risk tolerance and behavior are likely to be different.
363,What % of the population is vaccinated?
364,It's easy to estimate efficacy from that

As the world’s less affluent countries scramble for COVID-19 vaccine and contend with deadly surges of the disease, researchers in South Africa have just documented an ominous development: the collision of the pandemic with HIV/AIDS."
1441,Geneticists and infectious disease specialists there have uncovered potentially dangerous coronavirus mutations in a 36-year-old woman with uncontrolled HIV who was unable to shake the SARS-CoV-2 virus for close to eight months.
1442,"The driving force behind the patient’s rapid accumulation of genetic changes is probably her impaired immune response due to her unsuccessfully treated HIV, the researchers said."
1443,"The case highlights a difficult truth: that affluent nations racing to vaccinate their own populations will remain vulnerable as long as the coronavirus is spreading and mutating in low- and middle-income countries, where lack of vaccine has kept COVID-19 immunization rates low."
1444,"That’s especially true in countries like South Africa, where HIV infections are common but often undetected."
1445,"“This underscores the advantage that this virus has until we can put the brakes on it, and we have to put the brakes on it globally,” said Dr. Bruce Walker, founding director of the Ragon Institute, an immunology research center in Boston."
1446,"While the South African patient was diagnosed with HIV back in 2006, doctors had been unable to control her viral load with standard antiretroviral therapy, and her immune system’s population of CD4+ T cells — which may play a role in clearing coronavirus infection — were very low."
1447,"For 216 days, the woman continued to test positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus."
1448,"She was hospitalized with moderate illness for nine days in September soon after she contracted the coronavirus, but she never became severely ill with COVID-19."
1449,"Still, the coronavirus that lingered in her body underwent 13 genetic changes related to its crucial spike protein, along with at least 19 other genetic shifts elsewhere that could change the behavior of the virus."
1450,The new findings raise the specter that HIV/AIDS — a 40-year-old scourge that has killed 32 million worldwide — could complicate efforts to eradicate a COVID-19 pandemic that has killed more than 3.5 million in less than a year and a half.
1451,"Until the South African patient, there has been little evidence to suggest that HIV-infected people could complicate the pandemic’s trajectory."
1452,HIV-positive people were not known to be more likely to become infected with the coronavirus.
1453,And research had suggested they did not suffer worse medical consequences of COVID-19.
1454,"But if her case turns out to be typical, that picture could change: HIV patients whose infections are not controlled with medication could “become a factory of variants for the whole world,” said Tulio de Oliveira, a geneticist at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Durban, who led the new research."

1606,"So while it's true that Republicans may not have been more open to the vaccination than Democrats, there was definitely a change that made Republicans more receptive to it and Democrats less receptive to it at that time."

1655,Which makes sense since either vaccine or natural infection provokes an immune response from the body.

No, with high enough vaccination rates current variants would not be able to spread in the population as the transmission rate would be too low."
1711,We will probably reach that point when around 80% of the population is fully vaccinated.

1762,Last I checked South Korea and Japan were among the the bottom 4 countries with the worst vaccination percentage.
1763,And at least from what I remember both of them handle the virus a lot better than most other countries because they acted quickly and traced contacts and really just worked very efficiently.
1764,From what I've read about Japan their main problem with vaccination is that they are basically drowning themselves in bureaucracy to the point where it just stagnates.

1777,You could get a dose each day for 100 years and you still wouldn't be likely to get this condition.

1800,$500 per weeks is starvation money.
1801,They could do so much better.
1802,Mine hasn't been moved forward.
1803,I had to book both shots at the same time (first one was 5 weeks ago) and I've heard nothing about the next being moved.
1804,It's been so wonderful being somewhat back to normal lately.
1805,I don't even remember the last time I wore a mask in a store.
1806,However.
1807,When the heck are OBs offices going to stop saying spouses can't come to ultrasound appts?
1808,It's becoming insane to me now.
1809,It's like they don't know how to transition.
1810,My OBs office is still acting like it's May 2020.
1811,Someone in full PPE taking temps outside and asking tons of questions.
1812,"No ""visitors"" which somehow includes infants you have no childcare for."

1815,I do NOT understand it now.
1816,It's absurd.

1818,Thanks!
1819,What’s the deal with these Fauci emails?
1820,"Because if you don't copy the headline, the post gets removed."
1821,"""Some means."""
1822,Like reading the article?
1823,"I mean, Seattle ain't the biggest city in this country, but I think it has a decent amount of international notoriety."
1824,"&gt; It is now during covid, but pre-covid it was suburban pseudohippie white women who thought vaccines gave their kids autism."
1825,"They suddenly got cool with it when the vaccine actually directly mattered and conservatives ended up taking the antivax helm

I'd actually say it changed well before that (with the HPV vaccine), and started getting much more popular with conservatives."
1826,"And then, of course, there's going back to before the Wakefield stuff, when it was probably more fringe."
1827,"Get mine on Saturday, cannot wait!"
1828,"Exactly, the FDA has to rubber stamp the approval or else a national disaster would occur."
1829,[removed]
1830,"I think these are some of the reasons

1."
1831,There's a weird ideological alignment between conservatives and rejecting covid measures including vaccines.
1832,"The UK doesn't have the same thing, we have dedicated anti-vaxxers and anti-lockdowners, but they are a very small movement


2."
1833,I think offering vaccines by age group very tightly helped with uptake.
1834,"In Scotland people got sent letters with their appointment so most people probably wanted to get it when they had the chance, whereas with an open systempeoole might delay booking."
1835,3.
1836,People travel internationally in the UK than in the US and I think the thought that they may need to be fully vaccinated to travel was a good incentive.
1837,"It takes up to 15 weeks from first dose to being fully vaccinated here, so it's too late to get vaccinated last minute when you decide you want to go on holiday."
1838,4.
1839,Lockdowns have been harder in the UK than in many US states.
1840,We went through a 3 month complete lockdown in 2020 than a four month complete lockdown in 2021 with partial lockdowns in between.
1841,By comparison things seemed to be pretty free in states like Florida.
1842,No one here wants to go back to that.
1843,&gt; Sure.
1844,"But if YOU get vaccinated, you're protected,

I only get the level of protection that the vaccine I get gives."
1845,None of these vaccines protects everybody that gets vaccinated.
1846,Pfizer may give over 90% protection - while AstraZeneca reduction in disease transmission may be as low as 67%.
1847,"Certainly we need to attain herd immunity - and as we do not know how many people have become immune through previous undetected infections, we cannot know how many people we need to vaccinate in order to achieve the magic number of immune people that will give us herd immunity."
1848,"Certainly I am better off having been vaccinated, but it is not a guarantee that I will not become infected, or pass that infection on to others."
1849,Possibly to others who are unable to get vaccinated themselves because of previous medical conditions.
1850,"&gt;They may be leery of the mRNA technology

Everyone is 'leery' of the technology, everyone knows there is a risk when you get vaccinated."
1851,That is not an excuse for refusing a vaccination.
1852,"It is a form of cowardice - and demonstrated selfish behavior, of people that think they can get a free pass, while the rest can take the risk of being vaccinated."
1853,These selfish people are putting everybody else at risk!
1854,"If not enough people get vaccinated, coronavirus is not going to go away!"
1855,What anti-USA sentiment?

1876,I run cancer clinical trials.
1877,"Not one trial by any industry sponsor, NIH-funded, or investigator-initiated that I know has contraindicated covid vaccine receipt for current trial patients."
1878,I don’t know your moms situation specifically of course but just wanted to chime in with real world advice we give to our patients which seems opposed to what your moms care team is telling her.
1879,Location may play a role.
1880,I’m in the northeast and in a health system which now mandates COVID vaccine for its entire workforce.
1881,"No jab, no job."
1882,Easier to get to you guys it seems.
1883,I hit a passport snag so I wouldn't know.
1884,😢
1885,It's sounds like you are combining the costs for you and your  partner?
1886,If so your original comment was misleading as it suggested that was a per person cost.
1887,It’s not true.
1888,"However, there was a defect in the manufacturing process and a bunch of people were given live virus in the late 60s which lead to vaccines being the most heavily regulated types of medicine when it comes to safety in the US."
1889,Article from december talks about 29 normal cases.
1890,I guess there were 4 more cases reported in the last two weeks.
1891,The 98 vaccine derived cases are not talked about in the cdc report I Just found.
1892,Who cares if you are vaccinated?
1893,Seriously why can’t you trust fauci he knows science
1894,"They're also hurting disabled people, who are too often forgotten or erased from people's minds."
1895,"We need to look out for the disabled community, many of whom can't get vaccinated."
1896,"As long as they are not kids,and no variants arise that the current vaccine will not handle I am fine with this."
1897,"Let them all get it,and see for themselves how serious it can be."
1898,What you wrote makes no sense to me.
1899,If they were not vaccinated then they would be in the 97%.
1900,But you wrote 1 dosers were left out but then you say they were in the 3% along with the non vaccinated.
1901,"If you tell them you are a needle phone and might faint, they could give you a nice comfy reclaimable chair - they do at the mass vaccination centre I volunteer at."
1902,Just a thought if you want the deluxe vaccine experience lol
1903,I have two different types (double and triple weave).
1904,"That day, I was wearing my double weave."
1905,I make sure my masks fit as tight to my face (I have facial hair) as I can get them.
1906,Throughout the pandemic I have taken every precaution and have had to defend my position almost daily from the constant peer pressure to “be normal” and “not let covid fear rule my life”.
1907,"At one point, I was being tested every week because of verified exposures and just before my first vaccine shot I had an antibody test done."
1908,"From all the evidence I have, I never got covid (and neither did my family)."
1909,"Which, in a twisted way, people use as “evidence” that covid isn’t easy to get and the media hyped it up - while ignoring how many people died or have long term effects from it."
1910,I still have a handful of people in my office that are not vaccinated and (to my knowledge) not had it but also refuse to get the vaccine.
1911,My co-worker is walking around proud he got it at this point.
1912,He talks about how he lost his smell/taste and was “a little stuffy” but was still lifting 400+lbs at the gym (he also went to the gym while sick).
1913,He keeps talking about how it “wasn’t a big deal” and he “doesn’t understand what all the fuss” was about.
1914,"He even made a comment about me wearing my mask yesterday, telling me that I didn’t have to wear a mask around him anymore since he is now immune (taking the opportunity to tell me, yet again, that he’s had it and it isn’t as bad as “they” say)."
1915,"My response was “look, I know you’re a young pup and you were lucky."
1916,"But, frankly, it’s people like you that are keeping me in a mask."
1917,"Since you were nice enough to come to work sick and expose me, that’s proof enough to keep taking precautions because of the selfish people of this state who have no regard for human life or even an ounce of decency for their fellow man."
1918,"I’ll wear my mask until I’m damn good and ready not to.” There was a little more tit for tat, but I basically made my position clear."
1919,"The Irish like to do shots/s

Keep going Ireland!"

2018,I'd call that working.
2019,After massive public funding from governments lol.
2020,Exactly none of the companies could have developed those vaccines without the government.
2021,"In the case of Astrazeneca, Sinovac, and Sputnik, these vaccines were developed by governments themselves."

2036,Yup.

2039,You have to consider the US government was rightfully focused on vaccinating their country first.

2045,"Regardless, even if you were somehow correct, who cares?"
2046,"People around the world, who otherwise wouldn't have received a vaccine, are being protected from spread, death, and subsequently grief."

2049,Hmm.

2051,If there's a test that could differentiate the antibodies from natural vs vaccine I would definitely want to take one.
2052,Just for my own peace of mind.
2053,Thanks.
2054,This is very incorrect.
2055,The mRNA vaccines are mRNA in oil particles that can be absorbed by cells.
2056,"The cells take in these particles containing the mRNA and then start producing the protein it codes for, which is the coronavirus spike protein."
2057,"The protein gets exposed to the cell's surface, the immune system realizes that the protein is foreign, and the body learns to produce antibodies for the protein and thus the coronavirus."
2058,"mRNA can only last for a very short time outside of the oil particles at body temperature before it degrades, so it's gone very shortly after it enters the cell."
2059,It never enters the nucleus and does not modify your DNA.

2091,"Not saying this is not true and I believe it's probably closer to the truth; however I grew up in king county and know they are not afraid to fudge numbers to push a political agenda, so I'll take this with a grain of salt."

2093,Haha right?
2094,People are silly.
2095,"&gt;minor inconvenience 

Again you are trying to argue a subjective."
2096,Do you know what subjective means?
2097,Do you know what objective means?
2098,&gt;	Have you just never worn a mask for long enough that you got used to it?
2099,I have been wearing N95s at work for over a year testing for a variety of diseases in animals including Covid 19.
2100,It’s extremely unpleasant but it beats getting things like Ebola.
2101,This can be for lengths of over 10 hours at a time.
2102,4-5 days a week.
2103,"&gt;	Calling a shirt uncomfortable is subjective, but it’s not like that subjectivity makes my argument any weaker."
2104,It absolutely does.
2105,You can’t just unanimously say masks are not uncomfortable and expect people to take it as the objective truth.
2106,Especially when they have there own subjective opinions from there own experience.
2107,"For one it doesn’t convince anyone who disagrees with you, and two you are asking them to disprove your subjective opinion which is just as impossible as telling someone there subjective opinion is wrong."
2108,The difference is I can actually empathize with someone that doesn’t have my experince.
2109,"It probably is a lot easier for individuals that maybe have to wear a mask no less than an hour a week, compared to people like me."
2110,"Nah, it's for an easy karma grab."
2111,"As the medical situation changes, the overall situation changed...sometimes very rapidly."
2112,"When else did that happen...oh yeah when this started and the scientists, you know the ones we need to be listening to, said we needed to change our behavior quickly to meet the medical situation."
2113,Those same scientists are the ones saying  that vaccinated people are out of the woods.
2114,We are in a situation now where those who have been vaccinated are very unlikely to even get the virus...what do you think the vaccination status is for most people on here?
2115,There is a very real likelihood that they simply don't have anything to worry about.

2274,"Hell, I think you're just incapable of understanding logic and science."
2275,No point of even trying with you.
2276,"I couldn't care less about the cases for un-vaccinated people - I'm much more interested in the 3% that were vaccinated and what their symptoms were, were at the hospitalized, and how severe."
2277,I wonder why those vaccinated were getting tested in the first place.
2278,[deleted]
2279,Here’s the data on cases (not hospitalisation) in the NW region (area most effected by the variant) up to May 25th.
2280,You can see cases are stagnant in those 60+ (mostly vaccinated) but are surging in younger age groups (less vaccinated or not at all).
2281,"I presume this doesn’t count as an actual source to OP, compared to the completely anecdotal evidence they have posted here

2292,**Update on Swedish vaccination numbers.
2293,"**

46.5% of all adults (18+) have received at least one shot, and 19.5% of all adults are fully vaccinated."
2294,"In terms of full population (Sweden has 10.38m inhabitants), the percentages are approx."
2295,36.7% for first shots and 15.4% full vaccinations.
2296,"A total of 5 400 436 doses have been administered, i.e."
2297,52 per 100 pop.
2298,Currently most (new) vaccinations are made with either Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna.
2299,AstraZeneca is reserved for 65+ and that age group has pretty much finished vaccinations save for the second doses.
2300,J&amp;J is paused indefinitely and will likely never be used.
2301,Excess doses are AFAIK being donated to COVAX.
2302,"Most of Sweden's 21 regions are currently vaccinating 50+ or around that age, together with 18+ with comorbities and medical staff."
2303,"The nationwide age distribution is currently

Age | First dose coverage | Full vaccination
---|---|----
18-29 | 9.88% | 3.87%
30-39 | 12.56% | 5.06%
40-49 | 22.67% | 6.4%
50-59 | 57.33% | 8.69%
60-69 | 85.19% | 18.95%
70-79 | 91.94% | 51.64%
80-89 | 93.08% | 84.66%
90+ | 90.55% | 83.84%

The national goal is that all adults should have been offered a first dose by Sep 5."
2304,"The past 7 days a total of 489 629 doses have been administered, which is an average of 69 947 per day."
2305,Adjusted to US population this corresponds to 2.2m doses/day.
2306,Around 650k doses of Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna were delivered this week.
2307,"A bit more than 16m doses is required to fully vaccinate all adults, i.e."
2308,around 11m additional doses are needed for that.
2309,Sources: [1](https://www.svt.se/datajournalistik/corona-vaccin/) [2](https://www.scb.se/hitta-statistik/sverige-i-siffror/manniskorna-i-sverige/sveriges-befolkning/) [3](https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/smittskydd-beredskap/utbrott/aktuella-utbrott/covid-19/statistik-och-analyser/statistik-over-registrerade-vaccinationer-covid-19/)
2310,&gt;I wouldn't fawn over Sinovac either.
2311,"Who's ""fawning""?"
2312,"&gt;They are giving a false sense of confidence to the population when really they are only borderline effective after two doses (50% protection from symptoms, 70% protection from hospitalization and death) and useless after one (literally, Coronovac is only estimated to be 3% effective after one dose)."
2313,"&gt;
&gt;And those efficacy numbers are before considering vaccine evasion from some strains that may push that down even further."
2314,"[This new study](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/npnv2y/immunization_of_serranas_population_with/) from Brasil - so with one of the worst variants widespread - shows a ""reduction of 80% of the symptomatic cases and 95% of deaths after the second vaccination of the last group of the city""."
2315,"It does clearly work well enough, as long as enough people get fully vaccinated."
2316,"Yes, clearly the more modern vaccines are better."
2317,But there simply isn't enough of them in the world for everyone.
2318,"In that context, the constant automatic downgrading of Chinese vaccines whenever they are mentioned is tiresome, privileged and arguably contributes to vaccine hesitancy in places where they will be needed."
2319,Nothing is 100% effective.
2320,"If you don’t want to take any risk, you should lock yourself down in your house forever."
2321,I for one am very happy to take off my mask in any situation where it’s allowed now that I’m fully vaccinated.

2330,I wouldn’t lock down at all.
2331,It’s an unacceptable violation of civil liberties.
2332,Your turn.
2333,It’s one main campus with I think 6 community hospitals and multiple clinics.
2334,so your argument is that its....
2335,less(?)
2336,manipulative to give larger prizes?
2337,Your stupidity is why this virus is still killing people.
2338,Yeah and it's all over the Internet that the Former Guy said he's being reinstated in August.
2339,Do you actually believe it?
2340,From what I understand you guys are only averaging like a dozen confirmed cases a day and no deaths.
2341,Meanwhile we finally got to under 10k cases per day (which was the general metric for removing the mask/social distancing mandates) and still have hundreds of deaths per day .
2342,Those Aussie numbers we in the US would expect by the end of summer once the vaccination effort is basically done.
2343,You guys are fine and the vaccination effort is just to open up your borders (which is obviously important too but not life or death).
2344,Thanks 👍
2345,I could ask you the same.
2346,So you don’t believe in natural immunity?
2347,I don't think we're gonna hit that anytime soon (NY)
2348,&gt; I feel like this issue is going to tear families apart even more than politics already do.
2349,Look at what happened to families in 2016
2350,"Wouldn't say locked down, in the last few weeks I've been on holiday to Portugal for a long weekend, spent any nice evenings in the UK in pub gardens and am going to the cinema next week."
2351,The WHO has been proven to be the worst international agency in the world.
2352,At its head Dr.Tedros continues to tout his incompetence by doing absolutely nothing since the start of the pandemic.
2353,It begets believe that he is still continue to be paid hundreds of dollars till today while people continue to die.
2354,Thanks for a thoughtful response!
2355,The travel factor is a great incentive I hadn't thought of.
2356,"And just being told you have an appointment...I just heard NPR discuss a study that said they believe that does actually have a big impact because we try to protect what we perceive to be ""ours"" - as in, this opportunity is being given to me so I need to take it, lest someone else get what I deserve."
2357,Super interesting.
2358,And you're right.
2359,I live on the border between two states.
2360,"My state was more gradual with lifting restrictions, but still quite open by UK standards, and right over the border it's been the wild wild west for 6 months."
2361,There was a Disney animated version maybe sixty years ago.
2362,I was a mere lad back then.
2363,He said he was feeling stuffy for a couple days and “a little tired” but dismissed it.
2364,"When he woke up the morning he didn’t come to work, he had lost his taste/smell and that prompted him to go to the dr."
2365,"So, he was showing symptoms a couple of days prior to going to the dr, which means he was shedding the virus that work week and didn’t know he was infected - a point I made to him why covid is dangerous to the populace."
2366,They’re the same people who said the chances of getting/suffering from COVID are low even though the chances of getting it after the vaccine are a tiny fraction of THAT percentage chance.
2367,"&gt; Natural immunity has prevented loads of hospitalisation

Who cant get it, maybe ever"
2373,"I agree, it's so asinine."
2374,My anatomy scan with our twins was in February of last year right before all of this.
2375,So I was so grateful we got that in before my husband couldn't come anymore.
2376,"The idea of doing one on my own is really scary to me, to be honest."
2377,It's just silly.
2378,thank you.
2379,But it was in the air all along.
2380,Better to have arranged ventilation.
2381,Hand hygiene is still probably a good idea though.
2382,"It is true that the inactivated virus provides alternative surfaces beyond just the spike protein, but this is actually a negative as it relates to potential variants, not a positive."
2383,The spike protein is more resistant to mutation than other surface proteins because it is complex and many parts of it cannot change for it to still actually work.
2384,"In other words, it is true that inactivated virus vaccines may be better at *some* variants, but this would be rare, and in aggregate they will be worse against variants than the mRNA and viral vector vaccines that target the mutation-resistant spike protein exclusively."
2385,This is on top of the fact that the mRNA and viral vector vaccines produce far more of the immune cells that allow for more resilient response in the long run than the inactivated virus vaccines.
2386,PS: the article linked to does not provide data in support of your hypothesis at all.
2387,Okay.
2388,The government (UK) is claiming the vaccine doesn’t stop you catching the virus.
2389,"If asymptomatic spreading actually exists then I must’ve had the virus many times, not once have I felt ill."
2390,Therefore I don’t need the vaccine because a) I have naturally immunity and b) it doesn’t affect me.
2391,Feel free to ask me more questions
2392,Shook
2393,"Pal, I see you’ve only been here for 2 months."

2406,Did someone spin his emails into something digestible and mean for these idiots so they'd think there's some liberal conspiracy going on?
2407,Or don't actually meet people from different backgrounds and realize hey we're all not so different...and mostly just want to be happy.
2408,He is very centrist.
2409,But there was a lot of “I like his policies but not his dementia” type Dems.
2410,They were over represented on MSMBC I remember.

2412,"Vocal minority calling for masks/distancing as cases rise in unvaccinated populations, but ultimately we will have moved on."
2413,"&gt;The number of new COVID-19 cases in France meanwhile held below 10,000 for the second day in a row and the daily death toll dropped sharply from last week, further easing pressure on hospitals as the vaccination campaign has expanded."
2414,"France, which began vaccinations late last year with priority given to care home residents, has gradually been widening eligibility by lowering age thresholds and removing conditions such as profession or state of health."
2415,"The European Commission on Friday authorized Pfizer (PFE.N) and partner BioNTech SE's COVID-19 vaccine for use in children as young as 12, paving the way for a broader rollout in the 27-nation bloc after similar clearances in the United States and Canada."
2416,US should prioritize Central America first.
2417,"It's need is great, it has direct healthcare implications for the US through immigration, and the US has a moral responsibility to that part of the world first."
2418,"In terms of Taiwan's allies, the US' priorities align."
2419,As for Taiwan itself though....
2420,This is a good thing
2421,That depends on what the goal is.
2422,If the goal is to never have any COVID whatsoever then yes you'd probably have to wear masks indefinitely.
2423,But that's stupid and unrealistic.
2424,The only ‘true’ lockdowns that worked were on islands with strict border controls or they ‘worked’ in countries with communist regimes.
2425,"All across South Asia, Europe, North America, Latin America there seems to be little correlation with harsh lockdowns and low death rates."
2426,Peru had one of the harshest lockdowns and was hit the hardest.
2427,This is nonsense.
2428,The real test has already happened and it was the continued plummet in cases to record low levels over the past month despite most states fully reopening.
2429,"A lot of people probably didn't even increase their ""risky"" behavior during MDW...thinking of folks who went to barbecues in lieu of going out to dinner or seeing friends indoors."

2432,"Bloomfield has said that a couple times (he's our Fauci), but PM Ardern has been quick to reject the idea."
2433,"On our alert system even at the highest lockdown levels we have never had a mask mandate, they are just recommended."
2434,Kiwis have thus never worn masks and the govt says culturally they'd never be acceptable.
2435,Similarly Bloomfield said we would have to introduce social distancing once we have vaccinated everyone (we currently have no social distancing).
2436,"Again the PM denied this by saying Bloomfield had been misunderstood, but he then repeated it in another interview."
2437,"That makes it clear the govt will never take that advice from him, there won't be any masking or social distancing."
2438,"US actually has more fully vaccinated people than the UK (52% of adults to 49% for the UK) and at 63% of adults with 1-shot, we're not too far off."
2439,Maybe I’ll win a laptop battery!
2440,Seems like getting the cities to 70%+ is far more important though than getting the rural counties to even 50%.
2441,The problem is being asymptomatic.

2455,I used to be pretty moderate anyways but the past 6 years or so have pushed me so far away from that.
2456,I think you made your point that your year was wasted and thereby completely “lost”.
2457,But I do think you are in the minority on this.
2458,"Also, looking at previous generations there has been other events such as WWII, Vietnam and the Cold war era that people could claim they lost 4,2,2 years respectively."
2459,It is about how you value your time.
2460,I do think this view of a total loss is a bit of a privileged view (just my 2 cents) as every generation has had these restrictions put upon them in one way or the other.
2461,I just recovered from the flu.
2462,I wore my mask when I couldn't stay home.
2463,No sense in possibly making someone unnecessarily ill.
2464,i mean that goes against what bloomfield said the other day but okay
2465,Not sure why you got down voted but I'm guessing they don't understand your tone.
2466,I'm in Australia and our govt's handling of the pandemic was FAR from perfect but I'm glad I'm here compared to much of the rest of the world.
2467,Turns out big issues are nuanced and blanket statements aren't always correct...
2468,I thought Canadians were allowed to go to the US...?
2469,A friend (Canadian) told me she were going to visit her gf (American) in LA a while ago.
2470,I think some states already have it too.
2471,[deleted]
2472,I really don’t understand the doubting.
2473,You have 2 doors: Behind door number 1 is covid (a virus that has by now killed millions of people of varying ages) and behind door number 2 is the vaccine against covid and once enough people are vaccinated we can start to move on from the pandemic.
2474,Which door do you pick?

2486,What does that have to do with my comment?
2487,"My original comment was a joke about wishing the vaccine could spread like the virus does, i.e."
2488,through the air and exponentially.
2489,It's astounding new York isn't on this
2490,These countries are using 1 dose of AZ followed by 1 dose of Pfizer or Moderna.
2491,So it's still only 2 doses total.
2492,Efficacy wise it seems to be better than 2 doses of AZ and on par with 2 doses of Pfizer so it would actually make sense to always mix these vaccines to maximize efficacy within a population if there isn't enough Pfizer or Moderna for everyone.
2493,"AND we got mostly the pfizer, which have a higher % of efficacity (tho AZ still good, just dont know the % of contagion)"
2494,It doesn't matter if cases go up if hospitalisations and deaths stay low.
2495,yeah rumors says that Quebec will announce shorten second dose to 2 months and we will be able to change the date we already have.
2496,Im already planned for august but would really want late june early july
2497,this is with respect to new zealand alone not the US or Canada or EU
2498,Thanks for support against this guy….
2499,"As an American in the southeast US where our vaccine acceptance is lowest, I am really interested in what convinced adults in the UK to do it."
2500,"In my state, only about 36% of people are fully vaccinated, and anyone 12 and above can get it here, so it's not about groups eligible."
2501,"It's extremely easy to find somewhere to walk in now, and it's free."
2502,"I usually think of the UK as having slightly less awful analogues to a lot of what happens here - we get Donald Trump, they get Boris Johnson, etc, same nationalistic trends, so I'm a little surprised it's going so much better in the UK."
2503,What's making it work in the UK that we failed to do?
2504,"Also, how can I move there because...yeah."
2505,"Well, if we had more doses, yeah we’d be going faster?"
2506,"Lol, that’s kind of obvious 

I’m pointing out that we don’t actually have as many doses as it seems, so obviously if we had more supply like the US or UK we’d be further along in second doses as well"
2507,You isolate if you’re allowed into the country.
2508,Guess who’s allowed into the country ?
2509,Everything I posted and you are replying too.
2510,Same.
2511,I work in Estate sales too and it's for some reason RIDDLED with them.
2512,"You know how many patriotic ""Stay sweet, don't let college change you into *sniffle* one of them ✊🏻😢"" I've gotten?"
2513,They for some reason project their ideals onto me just because I'm a nice and young looking girl.
2514,😂 Like dude I'm pretty sure we'd disagree on everything.
2515,"I think reducing the vaccine reservoir is more than sufficient justification, combined with reducing their risk of MIS-C, and allowing them to participate in activities where they need to be vaccinated."
2516,"You stand to gain a lot more by being vaccinated, in terms of freedom and ease of mind, than a very, very low risk of an serious adverse event."
2517,"I understand that the risk of serious covid outcomes may not be high, but it is to everyone's mutual benefit that we reduce the amount of virus as much as possible so that they are not at future risk of a variant that could affect them more severely."
2518,Even the B.1.1.7 variant has been cause for concern among younger children [lately.
2519,](https://abc7news.com/covid-chidlren-variant-coroanvirus-coronavirus-vaccine/10486843/) why not give them a very good chance of being protected and not transmitting this virus to others?

2531,At least they didn't refuse vaccines.
2532,"I remember when the vaccine was approved, my public health friend told me that it marked the end of the beginning."
2533,Because of fear mongering like this
2534,[removed]
2535,People who had mild cases of COVID are effectively the same as vaccinated people in terms of spreading COVID.
2536,"We can look at the length of time immunity lasts, but the science shows a huge decline in spread-ability during the first several months post-COVID and post-vaccine."
2537,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/duration-isolation.html
2538,Looking at those cases segmented by sequencing tells another story.
2539,Delta variant is clearly replacing and out-pacing the previous strains.
2540,Where overall cases are rising are indeed pockets affected by less adequate vaccination but the pattern holds for other areas and is simply not yet at the inflection point.
2541,This isn't a new lesson.
2542,It happened with B.1.1.7 too.
2543,https://twitter.com/TWenseleers/status/1399989484138213377

2580,Hovering at just over 50% fully vaxxed and hoping we make it to 70%.
2581,Please give your expert opinion on why it doesn't when medical commissions in over 7 developed countries have decided that it works and is effective.
2582,I just went off the specific events you mentioned.
2583,Just curiosity on my part on what happened.
2584,I agree and hope it helps their efforts in the months ahead.
2585,It however doesn't change the fact that there are still plenty of partially and unvaccinated people to fuel a surge.
2586,Vaccine effectiveness is also a factor of behaviors and exposure so the issue remains where the transmission will result in more evolutionary pressure against our vaccines.
2587,Our wider use of mRNA vaccines will certainly put us in a better situation but it will be important to fill the partial to fully vaccinated gap too.
2588,That’s the part they never understood

2602,"Plus, the NYC based media were scared shitless, so it got personal for them."
2603,Righttt.

2621,"You’re getting downvoted, but I know I’ll be wearing one on public transportation during flu season."
2622,"No indoor dining/bars, max 100 people at events (until last week it was 25), masks mandatory in all indoor public spaces + outdoor markets (and similar spaces) plus a ton of small regulations clearly devised by bored bureaucrats - nowhere near as insane and onerous as some places *but* they've recently gone whole-hog into vaccine passports which will become a permanent fixture of life, sadly."
2623,"And we're not gonna reach 60-70% vaccine coverage because people don't trust the government, at all - hell, the stated goal is 50% by the end of June."
2624,"Their own fault for being in the top 5 most corrupt EU governments, really."
2625,"Also, there is no plan for returning to normal, only vague promises of a ""somewhat more normal life""."
2626,"The messaging from local public health experts boils down to ""don't even think about taking off your masks"", ""we have to be cautious as long as the virus is among us"" (so, permanently cause it sure as hell isn't going away), ""maybe something normal in mid-2022"" and the classic ""vaccines don't stop transmission""."
2627,"Oh, and Israel, which has 85% vaccine coverage among adults (I think it's something like that, might be misremembering) *still* has an indoor mask mandate."

2633,"Did this skeptic ever use the line ""do you know anyone who has died of covid?"""
2634,Because you have a great followup to that now.
2635,"There's more than just the pandemic at work with the kids in my neighborhood I'm sure,  and my personal experience isn't exactly scientific."
2636,I have however seen multiple kids under ten in my neighborhood really start to go off the deep end over the last few months.
2637,My kid is friendly with everyone when he can be but he has had to cut off contact with several of the neighborhood boys because of truly disturbing behavior.
2638,Some of these problems were probably at work before covid but I can't imagine the pandemic helped anything a damn bit.
2639,I really don't consider the past year a wasted year at all.
2640,"The bad: I skipped a few social engagements, avoided dining out and had quiet holidays with my immediate family."
2641,I was laid off from my job because my employer took a massive financial hit due to the pandemic.
2642,The good: I spent a shit ton of time outside exercising and enjoying life.
2643,Dozens of mountain bike rides and hikes; more than 50 trips to the mountains to snowboard.
2644,I managed to land a better-paying job with an employer that saw a huge increase in business from the pandemic.
2645,"If your life sucked the past year because lockdowns prevented you from dining out and going to bars, well, maybe you should have spent the time re-assessing your priorities."

Polio and measles are definitely not mild."

2652,Can't remember if the doctor signs it too or not
2653,"Meanwhile, in Australia... 🤦‍♂️"
2654,&gt;but the increase in cases is leading to an increase in hospitalisations.
2655,Which is entirely expected to happen.
2656,Link has a soft paywall.
2657,Here is a brief summary.
2658,"&gt; A needle-free COVID-19 vaccination has passed pre-clinical trials, with its developers excited by the possibility of a painless, easy-to-use patch that could roll out in future waves of coronavirus vaccination."
2659,"&gt; Australian company Vaxxas, which was spun out of the University of Queensland to develop the technology, has been working with the University of Texas Hexapro vaccine candidate for the study."
2660,"&gt; UQ’s David Muller, who has been running the pre-clinical trials, said they had seen excellent results in their mouse models, even better than the results from the same vaccine administered via needle and syringe."
2661,&gt; The patch has thousands of tiny “microprojections” or mini-needles on its surface that are coated in the vaccine.
2662,&gt; Dr Muller said those delivered the vaccine to a specific layer of the skin that prompted a more immediate and robust immune response compared with tradition vaccinations.
2663,"&gt; Unlike needles, the patches do not hurt, and because they are single-use there is no risk of cross-contamination."
2664,"&gt; Hexapro is a relatively stable vaccine, so the patches can be stored at room temperature, and have been tested and remain stable for at least 30 days at 25 degrees and one week at 40 degrees."
2665,You guys don't have signed cards?
2666,How in the hell are they even issued?
2667,"It's just a doctor writing ""swear on me mum this guy is vaccinated""?"

2701,Watching someone die pretty much every month or so.
2702,Stood at the side of many graves.
2703,Went to a few virtual funerals.
2704,Some didn't even have services due to covid.
2705,Most were covid.
2706,One was cancer.
2707,One was various other medical issues.
2708,Scattered amongst all those people dying were phone calls I got from panicked friends telling their husband/wife/mom/dad/grandma/grandpa was in the hospital and they didn't think they were going to make it.
2709,My dad (who I am estranged from and haven't spoken to in 5-6 yrs) called me one night and told me my mom (who I knew was sick) probably wasn't going to make it and that I should prepare myself.
2710,All of these people ended up making it including my mother but I had no idea that was going to be the case as I got the same call about other people who didn't.

2719,But you make the most of what you have.
2720,In 2020 I did more running than ever (couldn't get out of the house otherwise in the early days of lockdown) and ended up in pretty great shape 'til I injured myself in Oct.
2721,I learned how to noodle around on the ukulele and I messed around with a number of other hobbies and skills.
2722,All of this while working from home in isolation.
2723,Is it what I planned to do in 2020?
2724,Absolutely not.
2725,But I did what I could to make the best of a bad situation.
2726,Don't be such a drama queen.
2727,I'm fully vaccinated and I still need to go through the same bullshit as last year just to travel for work.
2728,Have some patience and things will get back to normal.
2729,"We hoard our vaccines so that Big pharm can make a killing off this crisis, while China has taken the overwhelming lead supplying the developing world with vaccines to end this global health emergency."
2730,"Why on earth would Taiwan (which will ALWAYS be China, so get over it!)"
2731,"need fucking vaccines from the west, unless we were trying to tear China apart?"
2732,(which the western imperialists are totally trying to do btw).
2733,The dollars are the donated doses.
2734,The money COVAX has received has been used to purchase vaccines for poor countries.
2735,The way COVAX has been set up is rich countries pool in money together for bulk contract deals with pharmaceutical companies at a 2:1 ratio for what they get to keep.
2736,For every $2 spent rich nations get $1 in vaccines.
2737,"The other $1 goes to poor countries, so it's a way for rich nations to get something out of it but also donate something in return to poor nations."
2738,COVAX has delivered a decent amount of vaccines so far to poor countries so Canada is making an impact.
2739,The criticism being made here is about Canada receiving that $1 out of $2 spent it's entitled to under the COVAX system.
2740,Those criticizing are stating that they believe Canada should instead be giving out the full amount it paid into COVAX and have all of the vaccines go to poor nations instead of 50% which is how the COVAX system is intended to work.
2741,This is a fair criticism.
2742,Canada has been able to receive a very large amount of vaccines from unilateral bulk contract deals it has made with pharmaceutical companies.
2743,"It has a high vaccine rate compared to the world average, so the criticism being made is it's not doing enough."
2744,I would agree with that.
2745,I think Canada should be donating more at this point.
2746,"This issue isn't really specific to COVAX though, or Canada for that matter."
2747,It's a very broad Western world vs the rest of the world problem.

2754,St. Louisan here.
2755,Busch is just a water treatment plant.
2756,Yup-the wave seems to be dying down majorly.
2757,"Lats month I would hear stories of people dying everyday, relatives in the hospital every week, huge oxygen shortages etc."
2758,None of that the past 2 weeks.
2759,The situation is still bad but not catastrophic as before.
2760,I can see this wave ending by july.
2761,He threaded the needle around an outright lie.
2762,"They said more basic masks reduce spread, which is true."
2763,"They also said they primarily protect others, not the wearer."
2764,Also true.
2765,They relied on old and shoddy research to suggest that normal people couldn't learn to take good advantage of wearing a small particulate filtering respirator.
2766,That was weak and they knew it.
2767,They just wanted to preserve supply for medical providers.
2768,The entire time they’ve been using a clip of him from January saying literally exactly what’s in the emails as “proof” he lied.
2769,Now they’re pretending the email has brand new information in it to prove the same point.
2770,"But everyone who’s been paying attention knows asymptomatic spread is less likely, China didn’t report their numbers, masks protect others from droplets, not the wearer."
2771,There’s 0 new info.
2772,"The opposite isn’t true, Canada is not accepting foreigners unless they’re travelling for an approved reason"
2773,Because the people that don’t fit the narrative are silenced.
2774,I got myself banned from this sub for expressing contrasting beliefs.

2776,Don't forget to be scared!

2778,That's not a very low risk...
2779,There are about 24 million children age 12-17 in the US.
2780,"If all of those were vaccinated, almost 100k of them would experience SERIOUS side effects."
2781,And for what?
2782,Protecting unvaccinated adults?
2783,Serious MIS-C is so rare it's not even worth mentioning in this context.
2784,"Furthermore, vaccines have not even been shown to do anything with regards to MIS."
2785,It is not to everyone's mutual benefit.
2786,The ones benefiting from it are unvaccinated adults.
2787,"Statistically, the children themselves seem to have no real benefit from it."
2788,"The Alpha strain has been around since November, and has been the dominant strain in most of Europe since."
2789,"Personally, I think that the vaccine should be mandatory for adults."
2790,"Leave the children out of it, because it does not benefit them."
2791,"With some people freaking out about the Indian variant and what not, it's interesting to note that the rise in cases in India was widely covered by media but nobody is talking about the fact that cases in India are now at 30% of peak."
2792,"(400k May 8th, 130k yesterday)."
2793,And yes India is underreporting but that would be true on May 8th just like it is today
2794,We landed on the moon (69) the same time we realized segregation was bad (65).
2795,Humans are simultaneously the smartest and dumbest living things on the planet.
2796,The UK probably has far less natural immunity than the US does.
2797,"I got my info from this [article](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.ft.com/content/f12aa466-9cc5-4200-8742-4324d31d4cf0), but I will do some more digging!"
2798,Thanks for the info and didn’t mean to mislead anybody.
2799,Shocker
2800,There is absolutely nothing there that states the vaccines have an immediate effect (even a small one).
2801,"This is from CTV News, not the Government of Canada."
2802,This will not happen.
2803,"If Israel, US and part of Canada are lifting all restrictions there is no way EU will not lift restrictions after 60-70-% are vaccinated."
2804,What are the exact restrictions in your country?
2805,"45 years might be your lifetime but not your parent’s, again this is why I am calling this a privileged view."
2806,"Your example holds true though, have we done progressively better at limiting loss of life due to war, famine and disease, yup absolutely."
2807,"But these events do happen, even in North America."
2808,It’s your choice (and other’s) to either make the best of a year or completely write it off.
2809,Like I said I think the latter is a privileged view.
2810,"Yeah, it is pretty complicated."
2811,We have strong state governments (Mostly Labour.)
2812,who really saved us from our federal government’s mishandling of covid.
2813,All while the liberal government and their PR arm (The Murdoch Media) absolutely went apeshit trying to undermine them.
2814,The Federal government has been responsible for the vaccine rollout and they have absolutely botched the vaccine rollout.
2815,Zimbabwe and Brazil are amongst the countries that have vaccinated a greater percentage of their population than Scott Morrison has managed.
2816,Considering that we are a rich nation with amazing infrastructure and a relatively low population it is absolutely shameful.
2817,Basically they are going off of the emails where Fauci said things like Masks not working and that it can’t spread from asymptomatic people.
2818,What they don’t point out is all those emails were sent in January or February of last year when close to nothing was really known about the virus.
2819,Basically this is classic republican truth bending
2820,I flew back to the States to volunteer on a political campaign and I again fell in love with it.
2821,"No, it's far from perfect, but it's also amazing."
2822,Americans are FARRRR more interesting and friendly than Canadians (who are polite but quite dull).
2823,I get it when someone wants to hate on America because they need to process against the brainwashing we all got as kids.
2824,"Hopefully and eventually they come back around to loving that amazing, but incredibly imperfect, place."
2825,"&gt;Amazon (AMZN.O) is testing its front-line staff in Britain for coronavirus variants and feeding the data to public health officials, including in hotspots where a strain first found in India is spreading fast."
2826,"Aided by a rapid vaccine rollout, Britain is on the verge of reopening its economy after months of lockdowns but the Delta variant first found in India has spread, including in areas where Amazon has its lab and some fulfilment centres."
2827,"Luke Meredith, director of the Amazon Diagnostic Laboratory in Britain, said the company was open to offering the same service in the United States, and did not rule out making its testing programme available to the UK public in future."
2828,"We can compare everything with the Black Plague, then:
""Did 33% of your city die?"
2829,No?
2830,"Then stop complaining!"""
2831,"Nowhere did I say anything remotely close to ""it's just as bad as the war!"""
2832,"This is, however, the worst disaster in at least 45 years in North America."
2833,Peru is worse off.
2834,But looks like Uruguay is getting there soon.
2835,Get your numbers right my friend... one test “fit-for-fly” test will cost you £169 outgoing and same or £210 if you book it through the gov website.
2836,Interesting times to be alive
2837,Because I live in Europe lol.
2838,Vaccinations are not a guarantee of normality in Europe.
2839,"They should be but they won't be, that much is pretty clear from statements I've read - they talk about a ""normal summer"" (implying that beyond summer won't be normal) or ""some sort of normal"" but not actual, no restrictions normal."
2840,"That pretty much seems like a pipe dream at this point, no way that we'll ever get permission to actually live life fully again."
2841,"Hell, ""experts"" have already started warning about a 4th wave in the fall, at least in my country."
2842,"Plus, the whole vaccine passport thing is despicable and repulsive to me, it was a bald-faced lie that they would be used only to make travel easier."
2843,"To be clear, I've already signed up to get vaccinated because I don't want to be a second-class citizen and want to have the basic right of going to shops/restaurants without having my brain poked every 3 days for the ""privilege""."
2844,Raking in tourist bucks to patch up a wrecked economy =/= a return to anything resembling pre-March 2020 normality.
2845,"Europe has gone off the deep end with restrictions, zero chance we'll be seeing a restriction-free life regardless of vaccine uptake."
2846,There's a difference between the virus yielding an immune response - which is normal - and it being strong enough to protect a year later against a variant with some immunity evasion.
2847,Neutralization titers have been reduced significantly vs. several of these variants.
2848,Looks like the vaccination drive is turning into a great opportunity for promotions and freebies
2849,"They should boycott cruises, period."
2850,Awful for the environment.

2864,There are no prominent antivax celebrities or authority figures.
2865,There was initially more hesitancy in ethnic minority communities but prominent people got on board and campaigned.
2866,"Plus then, once it was having a tangible impact, the vaccine campaign gathered momentum."
2867,"I think having vaccines centrally controlled, via the NHS, probably helped as well tbh."

2878,Cool.
2879,Around 12 billion more shots to go.
2880,I'm not really for cruises for the other reasons.
2881,When it comes to novel pathogens it didn't take a genius to guess that cruises would have been a major problem with COVID.
2882,I would say a significant part of it is because there’s a lot of national pride and trust in the NHS.
2883,Maybe.
2884,US is at like 75% for people 40+ as well.
2885,"The main unvaccinated population *are* the younger population, who just aren't as motivated because their risk is simply smaller."
2886,Lot of anti-maskers in the comments.
2887,"Vaccinated*; ""partial"" is bullshit semantics, propagated by cowards."
2888,"Yes, fully vaccinated as of 5/19 with Pfizer, left for trip 5/25, showed one symptom 5/31, tested positive 6/1."
2889,"Very, very rare, and almost no noticeable symptoms."
2890,Vaccine did its job
2891,Not until more of the yanks are vaccinated hopefully
2892,Nonewnornal is already.
2893,Calling for faucis arrest too.
2894,"Probably around 70% by end of summer, 75-80 by end of the year."
2895,But that's just a guess
2896,"Yes I think we will accept 500-1,000 deaths a year from Covid without making any changes to masking or social distancing."
2897,We average 500 deaths a year from flu.
2898,"oh that is good to know, thanks"
2899,I’m guessing it would be because it doesn’t have full FDA approval because it sounds similar to schools not being able to require it for pupils for that reason.
2900,"A major reason why so called ""under developed"" nations are the way they are is because all their resources are going towards survival due to geographic issues beyond their control and remnants of colonization."
2901,As for healthcare these nations systems are obviously not well funded in total dollars but they're all pretty smart systems.
2902,We could definitely take a lesson or two.
2903,"Incorrect, there's absolutely zero effect of the vaccine until day 10-12."
2904,"In all the studies done, no-one saw statistical effects before day 13."
2905,if your friend got an mrna vaccine they are an absolute unicorn

2908,I did get a COVID vaccine when recently eligible and will get my second too.
2909,Your $1000 figure is incorrect.
2910,You can get packages for test to release for less than £300 (the £300 is from the highest end provider offering Test to Release I found when shopping around for a regular PCR).
2911,If you were talking about hotel quarantine then you dramatically undershot the cost by almost half.
2912,I'd be curious where you got that figure.
2913,We got so close.
2914,We were due to have our first one last Thursday.
2915,My partner tested positive for COVID last Wednesday.

2923,"Hey y'all, hoping someone can help me."
2924,I noticed a coworker today making fake covid vaccination cards.
2925,They're the kind of person most likely to give them to their friends or use for their family for travel purposes.
2926,Is there any entity I can report then to?

2961,Not going to argue with that.
2962,"But you are not running vaccine campaigns...the intention of a vaccine campaign is not to protect an individual, it’s to reach enough people that the vaccine actually takes the steam out of the pandemic in the community."
2963,By definition the vaccine campaign and incentives used to drive it are meant to reduce mortality caused by the disease.

2974,"12 weeks from that date (plus a few weeks wiggle room), you will be at the point where all necessary doses will be spoken for either via a second dose, or an appointment for one."

2999,Excuse me?
3000,Did you miss the part where I said I will get a vaccine?
3001,Where exactly did I say people shouldn't get a vaccine?
3002,Just because I am capable of understanding that there are risks for under 30's to take AZ (unlike you) doesn't mean I am anti-vax.
3003,By that logic the entire UK government is anti-vax you absolute fucking moron.
3004,If an under 30 wants to be as safe as they can be then they should take an alternative vaccine to AZ.
3005,If you think that's being anti-vax then you are even dumber than I thought.
3006,[removed]
3007,I wonder if the fact that things are getting good in the US (aka decrease in cases) is part of the reason why people are not in a rush to get vaccinated.
3008,Compared to countries like UK/Canada where there is/was a recent wave or scariant fear.
3009,If India stopped prioritizing bullshit religious treks over actually fighting Covid they would be doing much better.
3010,"On the other hand, the CDC has a fomites first idea for damn near everything, *and* we do know droplets are still the major source of COVID exposure (See: the early Korean air conditioned restaurant study: There is 100% a gravity effect for COVID transmission which suggests droplets as the primary form of transmission) that is not to say aerosols are not a form that occurs, just that droplets seem to be far more dangerous."
3011,"Just like Fomites do occur, it’s just extremely uncommon."
3012,For me the wait and see is going to be looking at the case counts as we get into summer.
3013,So much of the case counts were tied to seasons (I.e.
3014,the US had massive spikes during the holidays and individual states spiked when people were more likely to be outside).
3015,If we get into the summer with no waves I’m going to feel way more comfortable dropping all mandates and rules.
3016,"I'm not sure what evidence there is that Curevac, Valneva, Novavax &amp; GSK/ Sanofil are better, or that they can offer effective, scalable production?"

3022,"I have a sense preventing death of others is not high on many folks list of reasons, some might say it is nice side benefit, but I just don't see it as a main driver of folks getting vaccinated."

3041,People say that all the time about disparity between attention to negative news and attention to positive news.
3042,But like that also makes sense right?
3043,If something isn’t going well you want to draw attention to it so people in power and communities can take action and help out.
3044,"I’ve seen some articles highlighting the positive news, but it wouldn’t be productive to have wall to wall coverage about it"

3058,Can medical insurance companies start raising premiums on people who are unvaccinated?
3059,Maybe that might drive some people to get the shot.
3060,It's also easier to distribute
3061,"Canada had deadlines too, the only difference is they disregarded the guidance from the drug companies."
3062,Also saying they didn't approve Az till February is misleading because it is one of the least used vaccines in Canada.
3063,The first doses were set to come in May and the only reason it was approved earlier was because the US sent those 1.5 million doses which were never supposed to come here.

3065,"They lockdown, shut down flights, implement movement restrictions...for after  27 ppl got infected in a day  in a city of 15M

3068,Hopefully [booster shots](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-positive-initial-booster-data-against-sars-cov) will make it easier and safer for you guys to open the borders eventually.
3069,&gt; But no way will Kiwis put up with social distancing and masking to protect antivaxxers once everyone's had a chance to have one.
3070,What are the current estimates for the percentage of people who are willing to get vaccinated?
3071,Technically it could also work in reverse-- that some vaccinated breakthrough cases aren't being counted because they're asymptomatic.
3072,We're so close!
3073,I’m pretty sure that’s what’s going on.
3074,People don't want AZ because the government made a big show and dance of being concerned about the blood clots to distract from how they fucked the roll-out when we didn't have doses.
3075,"Now we have the doses, and nobody wants them because they're all waiting for Pfizer because of the scare tactics."

3086,I think at this point it’s become clear there’s no actual full end to restrictions on the table.
3087,"You can become infected but because you have the vaccine, your body fights the virus back before it takes hold."
3088,"In this case, the viral load stays very low and you are very very very unlikely to transmit the virus to anyone."
3089,"Therefore, asymptomatic screening would mark you as a positive Covid case (because the tests are very sensitive) but you are not in danger of getting sick or getting anyone else sick."

3091,Experts say
3092,[deleted]
3093,the immune response from the vaccine and the immune response from natural infection are different.
3094,That’s why you can get the vaccine and still test for antibodies from a natural infection.

3104,"Yeah, the base unmitigated R-nought for the pandemic strain of SARS-CoV-2 is now believed to be ​over 3."
3105,This was outcompeted - at high prevelence - by the UK variant (now Alpha).
3106,Alpha became globally dominant about as quickly as modeled and proved impossible for non-lockdown controls to contain.
3107,"Severe epidemics everywhere, even in areas (London) that were mitigating and had been hit hard the first time."
3108,Unmitigated R-nought of Alpha is likely 4-5.
3109,Delta(formerly the Indian variant) appears to be able to outcompete Alpha.
3110,Exactly how much is increased transmission and how much is immune evasion is not clear as Delta has to deal with much more immunity.
3111,But even similarly transmissible plus some evasion is bad.
3112,"Alpha isn't evasive, essentially no drop in vaccine performance there."
3113,Yes.
3114,Basically 90% of the articles on Fox today are doing this.
3115,"I’m trying to read them with an open mind to find the ‘Gotcha’ but so far, I’m just doing a lot of face-palming."
3116,It says Colorado is 3rd.
3117,Likely to be even higher.
3118,"Depending on how they did their assessment, some people counted in the vaccinated category might’ve gotten vaccinated when already infected and just not showing symptoms, while others might have been only partially vaccinated."
3119,"patient comfort, most likely; needles aren't painless to everyone and the fear of needles can be a big barrier to some getting vaccinated"
3120,Finally some great news!
3121,"The US, HKG and many other places are wasting vaccines too with way more vaccines than people who want/need it."
3122,"Even south Africa destroyed their AZ surplus after they stopped using it because of concerns with it's lack of efficacy against the SA variant 

And At least it's AZ and not Pfizer or moderna that's being wasted."
3123,Well.
3124,It’s also all over USA media outlets like Fox.
3125,So…we’ve got elected senators parroting the same thing like it’s a huge scandal and they seem to think this is a big slam dunk.
3126,Literally one of them tweeted ‘told you’ today
3127,"Pennsylvania may be on that list, but the county my parents live in has only vaccinated 36%."
3128,These statewide vaccination numbers don’t really make sense.
3129,"Outbreaks occur locally, so we should be looking at local vaccination numbers."
3130,Hmmm how are these states similar?
3131,We appreciate it
3132,Top comments in this sub at the time were calling for him to run for president lmao
3133,It won't.
3134,This will always be about a willingness to accept a certain number of deaths.
3135,It just is.
3136,"Sad, but true."
3137,"It's a virus, it won't get eradicated and it'll be an endemic moving forward."
3138,"They didn't choose to give second doses, they were forced to by people reaching the deadline as supply trickled in."
3139,The UK is using the same delay for second doses that Canada is.
3140,"They started vaccinating people in December, whereas Canada didn't even approve AZ until late Feb."
3141,Hello fellow wwu people!
3142,If that was your takeaway then so be it.
3143,I hope for your sake you manage to make lemonade out of lemons at some point.
3144,"Hard to imagine anyone’s life being without many challenges, surprises and unexpected circumstances."
3145,In fact those without these things would probably be considered to have a fairly sheltered and privileged existence.
3146,"Sadly, history has shown time and time again that poorer countries always suffer longer in any pandemic."
3147,Look how long it took for second /third world countries to eradicate smallpox vs first world countries.
3148,Victoria was absolutely hammered for its strict lockdown policies which were absolutely correct in hindsight.
3149,NSW allowed a plague boat to disembark in Sydney Harbour knowing that it was riddled with Covid.
3150,"Gladys, Morrison and Murdoch dragged the WLD premier Annastacia Palaszczuk through the mud for their border closures."
3151,Remember them dragging some poor woman from NSW who couldn’t attend a funeral in front of a press conference to try and manipulate public sentiment?
3152,Remember Palaszczuk’s press conference afterwards?
3153,Jesus that was heartbreaking to see a Premier who was absolutely doing the right thing in tears because of the mauling she was getting from the Liberal party.
3154,Do we even need to talk about the fanatical support Scotty from Marketing gave Clive Palmer over the WA border closures?
3155,Don’t try to rewrite history here.
3156,The Liberal Party are absolutely on the wrong side of history here.
3157,It is a sustained pattern of reprehensible behaviour.

3160,That's what Bloomfield has said.
3161,Our reward for getting fully vaccinated will be introducing social distancing and masking.
3162,Makes zero sense.
3163,Luckily he doesn't have any actual power to order that and the govt would never do it.
3164,So instead what has essentially happened is Bloomfield is changing tack and saying the border will need to stay closed even after we have vaccine induced herd immunity.
3165,He's heard the strong pushback on bringing in restrictions but feels vaccines alone won't protect us if we open the borders.
3166,I expect we will see borders open very slowly over the course of 2022 with vaccine passports and negative test results required and limited to a growing handful of countries.
3167,But no way will Kiwis put up with social distancing and masking to protect antivaxxers once everyone's had a chance to have one.
3168,Well Taiwan's mistake is that they didn't threaten to switch to China vaccine.
3169,US is helping Latin American because they're genuinely afraid these guys might switch to China vaccines and undermine US influence.
3170,But Taiwan under DPP is so vehemently anti-china (half of r/taiwan thinks Chinese vaccines are literally poison) that US analysts would know there zero chance that Taiwan will switch...
3171,So US has little incentive to prioritise Taiwan.

3281,We were late locking down but once we did it was pretty strict.
3282,Only got indoor dining and drinking back 2 weeks ago and even then there is restrictions.
3283,This post appears to be about vaccines.

3289,If I understand correctly in the UK they used almost only AstraZeneca.
3290,Can someone from the UK report how many people died just after the AZ vaccine?
3291,"Here in Italy there is a big discussion, there are at least 10 reported cases for AZ and 2 for Pfizer."
3292,"Maybe not sound, but waves."
3293,Similar to that LIGO gravitational wave detector which can be turned into audible sounds using different algorithms.

3307,TL:Dr vaccinate as much as possible :P
3308,"I spent the last year railing against the stupidity of people I'm related to...dude, I know."
3309,Sigh.
3310,"No, because people who get vaccinated are probably more likely to not be total dumbasses in terms of exposure."
3311,They've been (apparantelly) saying that the virus is from a lab in Wuhan since last March.
3312,Obesity also.
3313,There are many behaviors that increase risks of needing medical care.
3314,Vaccination?
3315,Wow great advice.
3316,Who would have thought 🙄
3317,Sucks for those 3% who did the right thing.
3318,"Yeah, I'm under the impression that we actually have an excess of vaccine doses."
3319,"Unfortunately, we should've started building mRNA capabilities last year, when Pfizer and Moderna were frontrunners with AZ."
3320,"Got dose 2 of moderna about 28 hours ago about 17 hours in the headache, chills, joint pain, and tiredness showed up along with the inability to concentrate due to said symptoms."
3321,Chills slowly were replaced with a fever.

3335,✌️
3336,Ooo that's a perspective I hadn't thought of.
3337,The UK didn't play around with lockdowns and we had an incredibly disorganized clusterfuck of half measures or no measures.
3338,You don't?
3339,Americans claim to be exceptional but we're not.
3340,We're just like everyone else.
3341,Flawed no matter how much money we have.
3342,Everyone hates a hypocrite.
3343,Yeah.
3344,Parents are dumb and evil and obviously don't have the best interests of their children at heart.
3345,Why should they be able to make important decisions about their kids?
3346,"Argentina, Colombia, Paraguay, Nepal, Malaysia and Vietnam:("
3347,"To be fair, i think most people, in the US, do believe vaccines are effective."
3348,There are always nut jobs who would believe anything.
3349,"At least we don't have many people here who believe that we should, literally, eat cow shit to cure covid."
3350,"I've had two consecut positive blood tests for the flu, but never had anything other than maybe a sniffly nose or light cough."
3351,"Its symptoms vary quite widely, just like covid."
3352,Right?
3353,I was flinching and expecting pain but wow I barely felt it.
3354,Shocking.
3355,Me holding my sleeve down was more painful than the needle.
3356,It was also really quick.
3357,In other news: water is wet
3358,"Fair, but not in Ontario, they're actually going against the recommendations of the science table in favor of more restrictions now."
3359,It's lunacy.
3360,I wouldn't worry as a man.
3361,"I have a female friend, late 30s and fit, in Germany who had a stroke after the AZ and the emergency room sent her home at a critical stage."
3362,It's been a few weeks now and she can move one leg.
3363,I know intellectually that it's an outlier but when it happens to someone you know and it's so clear what the problems were it does make you wonder.
3364,I'll personally be avoiding the AZ.
3365,I don't think men need to.
3366,When all is said and done we're going to have more antivaxxers per capita than any large western nation.
3367,"Stop fighting it, we know it's true."
3368,"The 7 day worldwide case count has been dropping by around 10k every day, from 820k May 1 to 480k May 31st, basically all of the world is trending down... except latin america damn it."
3369,Papá Biden give us some doses plz
3370,Wouldn't it make sense that the same biases that influenced the slow admittance/resistance that COVID is airborne affected our understanding of other diseases as well?
3371,"Take a look at this plot of seasonal flu vs rhinovirus:https://twitter.com/InfectiousDz/status/1333615011634294790

Isn't it weird that [rhinovirus which has been pretty clearly shown to be spread by fomites is still running rampant](https://academic.oup.com/aje/article-abstract/116/5/828/111471), but flu is virtually nonexistent in the wake of COVID prevention controls?"
3372,"Or you can look at this recent experimental study where they purposely infected participants with the flu and these ""donors"" failed to infect almost anyone in a well ventilated environment compared to their pilot study with poor ventilation."
3373,&gt;Uncertainty about the importance of influenza transmission by airborne droplet nuclei generates controversy for infection control.
3374,Human challenge-transmission studies have been supported as the most promising approach to fill this knowledge gap.
3375,"Healthy, seronegative volunteer ‘Donors’ (n = 52) were randomly selected for intranasal challenge with influenza A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2)."
3376,"‘Recipients’ randomized to Intervention (IR, n = 40) or Control (CR, n = 35) groups were exposed to Donors for four days."
3377,IRs wore face shields and hand sanitized frequently to limit large droplet and contact transmission.
3378,"One transmitted infection was confirmed by serology in a CR, yielding a secondary attack rate of 2.9% among CR, 0% in IR (p = 0.47 for group difference), and 1.3% overall, significantly less than 16% (p&lt;0.001) expected based on a proof-of-concept study secondary attack rate and considering that there were twice as many Donors and days of exposure."
3379,"**The main difference between these studies was mechanical building ventilation in the follow-on study, suggesting a possible role for aerosols."
3380,"**

https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1008704

I think we will see a major change in the understanding of respiratory viruses as researcher realize the barrier to aerosol/airborne transmission isn't as high as we once thought."
3381,Italy was hit very early.
3382,It's not confusing.
3383,First dose coming up in 4 days time for me...
3384,So relieved I could cry.
3385,The last year has been utter hell.
3386,I thought it said US at first and I was happy.
3387,Then I realized it said UK and I got sad.
3388,"But congratulations Brits, I am happy for y'all."
3389,Please pray for the US to gain some common sense.
3390,It's so rare the US gets anything right *on the first go round*.
3391,USA USA USA!!
3392,"Sorry, it's just so damn rare."
3393,Literally the only accurate statement in the entire thing is that people can still contract COVID after the vaccine.
3394,Nobody is claiming it’s 100% effective.
3395,The best studies are 95%.
3396,Those that are infected post-vaccination are seeing a drastically lower incidence of severe symptoms and complications.
3397,Coronavirus And influenzas are literally entirely different families of viruses.
3398,The symptoms that they mirror are because they are viruses that infect the lungs.
3399,Of course anyone can have the same outcomes.
3400,The coronavirus vaccine efforts began a long time ago  on the original SARS and MERS.
3401,All the research had already been done.
3402,It was a minor tweak to make it into COVID because it’s not really significantly different.
3403,"That’s also why it’s so important to vaccinate now, because the more people that are vaccinated, the fewer people can get infected."
3404,"Fewer infectable hosts means less spread, less spread means lower chance of mutation, lower chance of mutation means we don’t do this whole dance again in another 5 years."
3405,"Please, take your Facebook “research” elsewhere."
3406,Preferably back to your echo chamber where you can “research” about the tracking chips on fucking Facebook from your cellphone.
3407,"The Washington ""rural shit heads"" make your food and are beholden to your shitty leftist politics."
3408,Every one outside of king county wants to leave Washington because of conceited urban shit heads like yourself.
3409,I am fully vaccinated today!
3410,So excited and ready to enjoy my summer!
3411,I would like to think that and statistically it appears that way.
3412,"It's not much comfort when you have a friend that had a stroke out of nowhere seven days after, after she was sent home from the Emergency Room and told it wasn't a problem."
3413,"She's not doing well, she can apparently move one leg."
3414,Many provinces have released a plan with a clear end and percent vaccinated goals.
3415,"For example, look at BC's plan its pretty good."
3416,"4.5 million doses of the vaccine given, out of approx 45 million needed (2 doses for everyone), since late February, vaccines getting sent to entirely wrong states, causing people who are still waiting in the first phase not getting any yet, and other states being able to give them to people just walking and getting it."
3417,"Only approximately 10% of our aged care workers have been vaccinated, when they were originally supposed to be all vaccinated within 6 weeks of the rollout starting back in February, there's really just too much to mention, it's been a cluster fuck

https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/datablog/ng-interactive/2021/jun/03/covid-19-vaccine-rollout-australia-coronavirus-vaccination-progress-updates-tracker-victoria-nsw-queensland-qld-daily-live-data-stats-updates-total-numbers-distribution-schedule-tracking-new-cases-today"
3418,"&gt;fringe beliefs like anti-vax, anti-gay, anti-abortion, anti-universal healthcare

Oh, to live in a country where those are fringe beliefs."
3419,"That's essentially the party line for the 35% or so that unwaveringly support(ed) Trump, with a hefty dose of xenophobia added in."
3420,We play it fast and loose over here with the meaning of credibility too.
3421,This is depressing.
3422,I wish - their base is gonna move onto the next thing to be outraged about.
3423,&gt;If the vaccine just boosts your immune system to the point that it can fight the virus better then how is that any different from people whose immune systems were strong enough to fight it off with no vaccine?
3424,Think about an athlete.
3425,"They might have natural ability, but they still need to practice to get better and stay consistently good."
3426,"As for asymptomatic spread, why some people have symptoms and others don't is not well understood, but it's not the same thing as the viral load."
3427,"Back to your original question, we don't want to test/track vaccinated people because they are unlikely to contribute to spread and it will just cause noise in the data."
3428,"Telling people that they can go here and go there without a mask if they are vaccinated doesn't help, because you know who else will go without a mask, that's right, those 97%ers."
3429,"In Alberta, it's 64.7% but will reach that soon :) Something like 83% of those 12 and up have booked for or have already gotten at least one dose."
3430,I don't think you all realize how little 1 billion dollars is to most multi national corporations.
3431,"We are getting closer to vaccinate children, and for many needles will be a no-go, or at best a logistical nightmare"
3432,Hospitalized since February?
3433,At least that’s what the article said.
3434,"I wouldn’t have been able to get vaccinated in February, are we sure it’s all their fault?"
3435,No shit
3436,[removed]
3437,What does 'virtually' mean?
3438,"That makes more sense, just being a lower priority somewhere with generally a shortage of doses is reasonable, and the evidence does show no loss of second dose effectiveness with extended delay between doses and a reasonably high effectiveness for single doses to prevent unchecked spread."
3439,"If the option is between 50% being fully vaccinated or 100% half dosed, you're decidedly better off with everyone being partially dosed"
3440,Shocker
3441,You can lead a horse to water...
3442,"Isn't this like saying ""97% of bike accidents are among cyclists""?"
3443,"It is now during covid, but pre-covid it was suburban pseudohippie white women who thought vaccines gave their kids autism."
3444,They suddenly got cool with it when the vaccine actually directly mattered and conservatives ended up taking the antivax helm
3445,All of the people on immunosuppressants.
3446,"Rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, lupus, Crohn’s disease, MS, those folks can’t take it."
3447,"There are concerns about side effects for anyone with allergies that cause anaphylactic shock, which includes nuts, but also other substances."
3448,This is the reason for the 15-minute wait after the jab.
3449,"Perhaps in this case the doc's overly panicky, or the patient's allergies are extreme."
3450, Oops No Shit.&amp; Is it any wonder.
3451,97% of unvaccinated King County residents  always had Freedom to chance catching covid &amp; not wear a mask.
3452,They always had that choice.It was what they wanted .
3453,All asked of them was to be safe &amp; keep others safe from a killer virus by wearing a mask it was a plea to protect our nation &amp;  what was right for their own country &amp;their fellow Americans but they chose not to .
3454,So there you go.
3455,The population of Canada is about 3% that of India alone.
3456,Not vaccinating our population ASAP so we can help developing countries faster would be barely a drop in the bucket of what’s needed.
3457,"We have almost no natural immunity, and being able to open the borders with the US sooner helps both economies recover faster and means that we can both help the rest of the world better too."
3458,The CDC website is trash.
3459,There’s 10 different pages with different information for any given topic.
3460,It’s a struggle to find the right info.
3461,Ahhh apperantly they're prioritizing first shots so apart from healthcare workers and some other categories no one under the age of 60 is to be given the second shot.
3462,Well damn... they should probably update that shit.
3463,For a serious topic they really shouldn’t have that old info on the website.
3464,Forget the 30 bn on vaccines.
3465,We've literally been printing trillions of dollars for the past year and a half because of this shit
3466,And immunocomprimised people should absolutely be vaccinated!
3467,There are very few contraindications to being vaccinated- really only if you have a known allergy to a component.
3468,"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html

Yes, drastically."
3469,"I never had COVID (regular blood donor so I got a lot of antibody tests, so I basically know for sure) and I was stoked to be at a 16,000 person indoor event in NYC last week (Knicks game)."
3470,None of the friends I was with had COVID either.
3471,We just know the vaccines work.
3472,I guess it was this part from the CDC website which may or may not need to be updated if there is new data?
3473,“We’re also still learning how long COVID-19 vaccines protect people.
3474,"For these reasons, people who have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 should keep taking precautions until we know more, like wearing a mask in indoor public places, avoiding large indoor gatherings, and washing your hands often."
3475,"Vaccinated people do not need to wear masks outside except in crowds.”

Unless that has changed."
3476,[removed]
3477,"im having the same issues with my mom, she keeps saying long term effects of the vaccine are dangerous and even maybe deadly, can you or anyone help me with that?"
3478,I know many distrust big pharma and vaccines in general but what can i show or say that will maybe help her?
3479,"&amp;#x200B;

 i need to prove to her some how its safe and ok. She just worries so much about everything."
3480,My kids were already homeschooled pre pandemic and it has had a massive effect on them.
3481,"We did our best to balance understanding what was going on and not living in fear, but fear won them over."
3482,"I think once they are able to get the vaccine (too young now at 8 and 10) they will relax a little, but until then, we are trying to undo the damage that the past year has done to them mentally."
3483,And honestly their day to day was hardly unchanged but kids understand more than we think.
3484,Ahhh the ministry should catch up with the evidence
3485,Why do we have a bot running around censoring people?
3486,Have we learned nothing?
3487,[removed]
3488,Thank you!
3489,We go to great lengths to make sure people are safe these days.
3490,This ends up saving the stupid more than the smart ones.
3491,Evolutionary pressure for intelligence is dead.
3492,"In fact, it's the opposite."
3493,&gt; I’m happy but also very weary at the same time.
3494,I'm sorry to hear you're tired.
3495,I would be wary of unexplained weariness.
3496,[removed]
3497,Almost certainly.
3498,The wealthy had the ability to go wherever it was available and do whatever was necessary.
3499,Some places you could work one shift at a vaccine clinic and be eligible.
3500,Yes they should be.
3501,Well.
3502,more like the 97% efficacy.
3503,But I think it is very important to make it known.
3504,It will encourage  others to get vaccinated.
3505,I’m not sure how you got that impression.
3506,"If you’re in the US, the CDC made it clear that the change in mask guidelines was because vaccinated people are unlikely to spread COVID."
3507,"A lot of people who are afraid to stop masking are passing around moral and non-scientific reasoning for wearing a mask, but the science has been pretty plain."
3508,Fauci has even gone on record saying he will go out without a mask because it’s safe.
3509,Lil fragile over here
3510,Can’t wait for June 15 here in California
3511,Your grandmother was a republican?
3512,"Smart lady, there!"
3513,Sad to see her gone.
3514,Condolences
3515,I would bet money that he cut the line like a good hypocrite and got it in January.
3516,after a year we are over it now especially with the vaccine out

3522,thats pretty much the case for most of the u.s. lol.
3523,the state of jefferson sends their regards
3524,"I don’t believe we should stop talking about Covid, especially since the world is not in the same position as the U.S is right now."
3525,But a media headline suggesting that we could see a surge in two weeks here is purely for generating clicks.
3526,"Masks mandates are dropped, states with low vaccination rates have been open for months, and yet cases are still dropping off a cliff."
3527,The “wait two weeks” is nothing more than a phrase that CNN hopes will keep readers on edge and engaged in regards to Covid.
3528,"Covid articles now should pertain more towards the trends in other countries, vaccine distribution for boosters, if/when immunity may wane, etc."
3529,Not what CNN published here.
3530,Oh if that’s the case I’m mistaken.
3531,I’ll have to read more.
3532,That was the impression I was given.
3533,Put your own mask on before helping the child next to you.
3534,"From a country where vaccines are only administered by the Ministry of Health, and apperantly ""their system doesn't allow him to get the second shot."""
3535,[removed]
3536,No.
3537,My mom has docs who believe that the vaccine is contraindicated during her experimental treatment for what is likely terminal cancer.
3538,But thanks for that.
3539,They did suggest my dad get vaccinated.
3540,Maybe you should see if they can fully sedate you?
3541,New York still isn't on this list because The Bronx and Brooklyn for some stupid fucking reason just won't get vaccinated fast enough.
3542,Nassau County (western Long Island) is at 75% and The Bronx is at 55%.
3543,And it's definitely not because of politics since The Bronx went 83% for Biden and Nassau only went 54%.
3544,There is a clear issue with specific ethnicities that needs to be fixed...somehow.
3545,I have no idea how at this point though.
3546,Had that happen as well - lasting almost exactly 48 hours from days (I think) 9-11.
3547,"Oh for sure, I just mean the actual 97-3 numbers are about as precise as ""yeah duh they work, what did you expect?"""
3548,You couldn't submit this set of data for peer review or anything.
3549,i'm not waiting around to protect people that can't be arsed to make the bare minimum of efforts to get vaccinated and protect themselves.
3550,this isn't in any way a comparable dynamic to 15 months ago.
3551,"Absolutely, everyone's circumstances are different."
3552,"While I'm 100% pro vaccine, I can understand hesitancy, and my mum's staunch stance against any hesitancy winds me up to no end."
3553,I'm a vaccinator and if it helps with any hesitancy I'm more than happy to answer any questions you may have.
3554,Edit: just reread your original comment.
3555,AZ dose 2 is safer than dose 1.
3556,"If you were fine after dose 1, you should be good to go!"
3557,"Yeah, he was from India and went to help family out."
3558,caught it while over there.
3559,I'm shocked!
3560,Shocked!
3561,"Well, not that shocked"
3562,*God works in mysterious ways.
3563,*
3564,"No, that’s not correct."
3565,It is very unlikely that the vaccinated are spreading COVID.
3566,"I think overall its mostly conservatives who lead the anti-vax charge from the things I read, but the only two people I personally know who are anti-vax are liberal (they even wear masks)."
3567,Because it was already like pulling teeth from a bear to get people to do the bare minimum.
3568,I wish we had more info on the severity of these cases.
3569,Are most of them asymptomatic that tested for work or after exposure?
3570,Or are these people actually getting sick?
3571,And how sick?
3572,"Hey, can I borrow $1.25M from you?"
3573,Its not that much money...
3574,[removed]
3575,This makes no sense how can the infection rate be higher now than last year when nobody was vaccinated 🤔
3576,There's some lung diseases that can't have it.
3577,"People with cancer, some people undergoing treatments lowering their immune system, people who are allergic to things in the vaccine"
3578,[removed]
3579,Awesome idea!
3580,!
3581,Exactly.
3582,I'm one of those poeple who never really had any serious contact with covid.
3583,Heard about horrible thing but never experience it luckily.
3584,Luckily no one in my immediate environment got serious symptoms or died of covid.
3585,But definitely door number 2 is the option I'll go for.
3586,And the hesitancy comes from the said environment.
3587,"My mother is against these vaccines, father got his first Pfizer jab a week ago but only after months of thinking."
3588,"And my colleagues are another story...they believe everything they hear/read in the news and then repeating them like some kind of prophecy and you can't argue with them and of course after a while these get to me, no matter how well I want to resist the doubt will slowly leek in."
3589,Sadly my mental strength is not like a concrete wall

3625,"If your doctors have not cleared you (my team of specialists have not), then you cannot get the vaccine."
3626,It’s actually stated by the CDC that they do not have enough data about how the vaccine will affect people with certain autoimmune disorders.
3627,Hence that blanket warning.
3628,"Having said that, I am really happy for those in situations similar to mine who have gotten the vaccine and not suffered any adverse effects as of yet."
3629,It means that there is hope!
3630,"Humans are complicated, we are a giant ball of emotions that hook into various things due to life experiences."
3631,"People in my family give ""rational reasons"" as to why they won't get the vaccine, but the real reason is some emotion buried underneath the ""logic""."
3632,Ofcourse one won't reveal such emotion because that requires vulnurability and emotional intelligence.
3633,"It's probably fear, but of what exactly I don't know."
3634,"Thats how we humans are, we use rationalize our decisions which are based on emotion, but then claim we are being logical."

3636,While you are right about putting an exact number on the efficacy...I think a strong pattern in favour of vaccines has appeared.

&gt; In the report released this week, the CDC researchers acknowledge that their tally of 10,262 breakthrough infections is **likely a “substantial undercount.”** Many people who became infected despite getting vaccinated probably experienced mild illness at worst and didn’t seek out testing to confirm the cause."

3762,"No, ""the index case"" refers to the initial source of all the other infections."
3763,So it makes sense that person was already infected and contagious.
3764,"Absolutely, but my point is that it's far more common for people with a mild illness to say they have the flu when the flu typically exhibits far worse than mild symptoms."
3765,"I can't count how many times I've had co-workers sick near me and claim ""Oh it's just the Flu"" and I'm like ""how are you functional?!"""
3766,"Second shots aren't related to hesitancy VS willingness, though."
3767,By definition with second doses you're only vaccinating those who were already willing.
3768,"As a measure of complete protection, fully vaxxed is the gold standard, but as a percentage of the proportion willing to roll up their sleeves, first doses are all that count."
3769,But it's also much greater risk.
3770,If chile became more pro China it's not a big deal but if Taiwan falls it's a major situation.

3782,"Crazy... we get such cards as well in Poland, but it's for a personal use."
3783,The confirmation is in a form of a digitally signed QR-code that everyone gets in their patient portal/app.
3784,And there is an app in the app store that anyone can get that scans and verifies such confirmations.
3785,With EU-wide certificate everyone got another QR code that is in the EU-standard and that's it.

I guess the first 7 EU countries that implemented the standard have a similar system."
3787,I wonder about the other ones...
3788,Certainly in California the only people able to get vaccinated at that point were healthcare workers and  the over 75s.
3789,Especially with the delta variant that requires the second dose for really good immunity.
3790,"The strategy of getting as many first doses out as possible worked brilliantly for us, but the game changed when we got the Delta stats."
3791,"&gt; Well if the vaccine doesn't work for 5% of people, then they can get it anywhere."
3792,A cruise ship won't matter much.
3793,That's nonsensical logic.
3794,Cruise ships are breeding grounds for infections.
3795,"If there's an outbreak on the ship, it will spread far more rapidly than in the general population because the infected people are going to the same places over and over, infecting more people who are going to the same places over and over."
3796,That's not at all comparable with being on land.
3797,Were you not following the spread of the pandemic in the early months?

3886,"This is great news, because (1) the vaccines are effective for those that want them and (2) because it shows those who aren't getting vaccinated will eventually develop [potentially life-long immunity](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03647-4) through infection (if they haven't already)."

3908,I stopped being afraid of other people.
3909,It was liberating.
3910,I don't get why some people don't realize this.
3911,Nobody said anything about human rights??
3912,Point is it’s embarrassing for a developed country to have lower vaccination rate than developing countries.
3913,People who are taking immunosuppressants such as those used for Crohn's disease need to be able to stop their infusions for a certain amount of time before/after the vaccination.
3914,This is to ensure that the patient will make enough antibodies from the vaccine.
3915,"My guess is that this person is on Remicade, which *does* cause issues with antibody creation, or they are too sick with the Crohn's right now to delay the infusion."
3916,source: am a patient with autoimmune disease who is on immunosuppressants that needed to be adjusted when I got vaccinated.

3927,"Yes, people lie on Reddit."
3928,"And I'll concede that the issue you have with that statement - ""lots"" - that I should have chosen a better word."

3943,"Folks with auto-immune disorders and those who are immune suppressed are at very high risk from COVID, which is why its very important that they get vaccinated."
3944,"I suspect in some cases, there is either miscommunication (their doctor told them who told you) or someone in the chain is not being truthful."

4010,"If we offered everyone in the UK the vaccine at the same time, there'd be a mad rush and we wouldn't cope, whereas maybe in the US, since the take-up is lower, they can cope with opening the floodgates?"

4141,Sounds like you have a medical background.
4142,I only know that my friend with MS was specifically told she was not a good candidate for the current vaccines because of her current status.
4143,"And my mom (middle of cancer treatment, in a clinical trial because of how aggressive it is) was also given the same advice."

4199,"If you look at the King County maps (go [here](https://kingcounty.gov/depts/health/covid-19/data/daily-summary.aspx) and click Geography Over Time) for COVID rates, and then look at the same maps for vaccinations ([here](https://kingcounty.gov/depts/health/covid-19/data/vaccination.aspx) and click Geography), they're almost a perfect inverse."
4200,North King County has amazing vaccination rates (like 80-90% of all people over 12!
4201,"), and 2-week COVID rates below 25 per 100k."
4202,"Meanwhile, southeast King County has much lower vaccination rates, and also COVID rates over 300 per 100k."
4203,"Basically, it's playing out exactly like the UK and Israel did."
4204,"You keep having community spread until you get to about 55-60% vaccination, then it craters."
4205,It's quite amusing to see the Chinese complaining about Japan offering vaccines to Taiwan.

4233,"Essentially it means that &lt; 5% will test positive for coronavirus, but says nothing about outcome."
4234,"The trials also showed a 100% efficacy against hospitalization and death, so if that holds up as well, those 43 people will recover comfortably at home (if they're even symptomatic)."

4280,Vaccinated people can get covid.
4281,"Their likelihood of being symptomatic is much reduced, their likelihood of getting severe covid is much reduced and their likelihood of dying is much reduced."
4282,Vaccinated doesn't mean bulletproof.
4283,It means your body has antibodies ready to go should you come into contact with it.
4284,Also some older people and people with weakened immune systems don't get the same protection as others due to immune defficiency.
4285,I'm in the opposite situation.
4286,"Out of my entire family on my mom's side (her, her four siblings, their spouses and all my cousins) I have one cousin who refuses to be vaccinated."
4287,Everyone else is fully vaccinated.
4288,That cousin has been told by my grandmother and my mom who she lives with that he is not allowed to see my grandma unless he is vaccinated.
4289,His parents are considering not letting him come see them either and fully support my gramma and mom's decision.
4290,He refuses to change his mind still.
4291,My aunt and uncle are incredible mad and are trying to figure out where they went wrong with him (their other two kids got it asap) and he has literally made my gramma cry because she feels he doesn't love her enough to care if he sees her again (she is 93).
4292,"Its crazy, he moved away to Pittsburgh, got surrounded by a conservative group after being raised in a very liberal household, and no longer believes in vaccines."
4293,Even our other conservative aunt and uncle can't get through to him (they are a surgeon and a biochemist so both believe in science).
4294,I feel like this issue is going to tear families apart even more than politics already do.
4295,"On my dad's side he's informed his parents we won't be coming for holidays unless my unvaccinated crazy Trump supporting conspiracy believing uncle isn't there, so that probably means no more holidays with them ever again."

- Restaurants can't keep up with demand or hire enough staff
- Rental cars are sold out
- Lots of tourists are complaining about all this, and also complaining about continued indoor mask mandates
- Locals want tourism to slow down."
4348,"We went from 0 to 50% of 2019 numbers very quickly and the island is not ready for it

4374,This is from Dr. Vincent Racaniello's biweekly reddit QA session.
4375,"Protection moderate to severe disease is the goal of any vaccine, NOT the infection."
4376,"After a year or two, even best mRNA vaccine will not protected you from infection."
4377,"""Not clear to me why boosters are needed."
4378,So far most of the vaccines appear to prevent severe disease with all the variants.
4379,"Infection is not prevented, only moderate to severe disease."
4380,That is how most human vaccines work.
4381,I think there is a tendency to extrapolate from influenza virus where a decrease in antibody neutralization titer against current strains triggers reformulation of the vaccine.
4382,But SARS-CoV-2 is not influenza virus.
4383,I think we need to observe how vaccinated people respond to infection and keep track of disease severity.
4384,"If it seems like more severe disease is occurring in vaccinated people, then we might change the vaccine."
4385,"But remember that T cells protect against severe disease and their epitopes do not change in the variants."""
4386,"""Those studies were done shortly after vaccination when antibody levels are very high."
4387,In a year the serum and mucosal antibody levels will be very low and will not prevent infection.
4388,"However the memory response will kick in in 2-3 days and prevent extensive replication, shedding, and disease."""
4389,"""The benefit of the inactivated vaccines is that they contain other viral proteins, not just spike."
4390,Those other viral proteins have T cell epitopes which can only be beneficial and help prevent disease.
4391,"The need for booster probably comes from not having enough inactivated virus, or it not generating a good memory response."""

4428,And if there was any part you did like I'd be curious to know what.
4429,Its very interesting to me how many people in America are so violently opposed to the vaccine.
4430,"I can understand being hesitant, but its like they dont ever do any research or talk to medical professionals about it."
4431,Many of the people I know who are against it are republican and supported Trump.
4432,"And as soon as the vaccine rolled out, they were praising Trump for being responsible for providing the vaccine."

4459,It never said good things weren't happening.
4460,It never said good things weren't on the horizon.
4461,"It just said, truthfully, that you can't compare first dose percentages to second doses."
4462,It says Canada isn't yet as far along as the UK and Israel.
4463,Is that negative?
4464,It's not.
4465,Unless you are saying there is no difference between the doses and they should just be skipped?
4466,I can't believe this comment thread.

4471,Yea typical ad hom nothings.
4472,I've got both my shots so your conduct doesn't effect me or 60% of Americans who also have at least 1 shot.
4473,Because it's not as simple as you think.
4474,Just because counties have the plans to make vaccines does not mean they can actually do it.
4475,India for example is licensed to produce the AZ vaccine but can't produce enough.

4477,"Shit, really?"
4478,"My buddy just finished his last chemo round for a rare lymphoma, I really hope his vaccine worked."
4479,"Well, two things."
4480,"Israel is like at the top, we are not far."
4481,Secondly you talk about fully vaxxed of other countries: the % of first dose is extremely signficiant because that dictates the absolute ceiling % of the fully vaccinated population.
4482,"First dose % tells us how high we can get, second dose doesn't."
4483,"In October no one knew the timeline on the vaccine , trump said it would be ready but that was the equivalent of a broken clock being correct twice a day."
4484,In any case I haven’t seen any data/polls suggesting that in October republicans were more open to being vaccinated.

4490,"It's annoying to realise this, right?!"
4491,"On the plus side, I think it helps develop empathy and connection with others (not just other sick people!)"
4492,So 3% are from vaccinated people
4493,"Yeah the worst seems to be over, but they are still lacking oxygen and oxygen production capacity."
4494,The US could send some oxygen producing machines and personnel to set it up.
4495,Also doctors and vaccines would help.
4496,"I overheard a neighbor talking about the California mask mandate ending and then heard another neighbor ask if he was vaccinated, and he said no...

Like what the actual hell, if you got vaccinated, you can stop worrying about the damn mandate."
4497,"I only wear mine in stores now, I don't understand how the concept is lost on them."
4498,"That also doesn't mean you can't take it safely, just that your team is being cautious."
4499,"I wash my hands in public restrooms but the amount of public restrooms that have crap sinks that drizzle just a tiny bit of water and then have no paper towels (air dry only) and then have a ""pull"" door blows my mind."
4500,That door handle is probably one of the dirtiest things you touch.. and right after you washed your hands.
4501,At least with paper towels you can use it to shield your freshly washed hands from the door.
4502,I just keep hand sanitizer on me and use it regularly.
4503,It made a huge difference for me in terms of how often I had crud running through my system.
4504,"Religious use of hand sanitizer and getting enough sleep is enough to avoid common colds / ""the crud"" 99% of the time for me."
4505,"To the first question, yes."
4506,If there is irrefutable evidence or intentional misleading comments then views change.
4507,Unfortunately about 30% of people will change views regardless of the evidence.
4508,I followed that story avidly!
4509,There’s no problem for most people in wearing a face mask.
4510,"This was really interesting for me to read because I have some social anxiety in general, but absolutely no reopening anxiety."
4511,Reading about all these people worrying that they will be boring and have nothing to say is kind of reassuring because I've had that experience so much in life and usually felt like I was the only one.
4512,"But now after so much isolation, I'm so eager to get out and meet people that anxiety isn't really a factor."
4513,"I'm not trying to make light of anyone else's anxiety, but seeing the tables turned in this case makes me feel like I'm actually pretty normal after all."
4514,Good stuff.
4515,"one thing that many people don't understand about COVID is that your case would probably be categorized as ""mild"" in the definitions of disease as ""mild, moderate, or severe."""
4516,"But i'm sure you don't think of yourself as ""mildly ill"" throughout the course of your illness!"
4517,"When you were feeling most unwell and you wanted to call 911, it's really not on the same spectrum as ""i'm sitting on my couch eating doritos instead of going to the gym"" of mildly ill"

4540,300 kids have died.

4836,Do you honestly think me reading various news sources posted by internet strangers and commenting on them is no different than being fed crazier and crazier conspiracy videos on YouTube after only a few clicks thanks to their perfected algorithms?
4837,Do you actually think the content is the same?
4838,"I mean, I just find it funny how you make this typical reddit ""you say bad thing about social media while using social media lel"" comment on a post of an *academic report* discussing the dangers of *conspiracy theories* being spread so easily and wide via YouTube."
4839,The shit that people consume on YouTube is 100% not news nor informative in any way.
4840,It is all the crazy ramblings of grifters looking to profit off of people's stupidity.
4841,Certain forms of social media are far more damaging than others and it always blows my mind when people choose to be ignorant about that and decide to treat every single social media platform as the same.

4843,Isn't that there is an outbreak of Covid in Taiwan recently?
4844,"It seems Taiwan can't get vaccine from the US, even Japan/South Korea has to wait to get the Pfizer/Moderna Vaccines."
4845,"Then Taiwan refuses the vaccine from China, since their government and people think it is not trustable."
4846,Then the last option would be BioNTech(BNT) from germany.
4847,"However, a company in China call Fosun has invested in BNT during the pandemic and becomes its representative supplier for China/Taiwan/Hongkong/Macau, so Taiwan also called it a Chinese vaccine and refuses the BNT vaccine as well."
4848,"Now Taiwan is developing its own vaccine now, but I don't think any vaccine will be available soon."
4849,"I guess some Taiwanese just realize how dangerous the situation could turn out, and decide to fly to China to take their vaccine shot."
4850,"China, on the other hand, won't stop the flight from Taiwan in my opinion."
4851,They treat Taiwanese differently and a unique policy on them.
4852,"Maybe they will cut off the flights from everywhere else in the world, but they'll still keep their flights between China and Taiwan open, to show some kindness to the Taiwanese people."

4863,These are all ways of removing or remediating the potential negative consequences of having sex.
4864,"If parents think that removing a potential negative consequence of something is the exact same thing as ""giving permission"", they're admitting the only way they have of getting their kids to follow a *moral* request is to make them fear *physical punishment* for doing otherwise."
4865,Your car insurance example is an apt counterpoint.
4866,I'm upset that during this global crisis countries should have gotten together and funded covax rather than doing bilateral deals with manufacturers to get ahead in line.
4867,I'm upset that vaccines could have been provided to places that needed them the most rather than wealthier countries.
4868,It's just beneficial to everyone in the long run.
4869,Also India manufacturers a lot of the world's vaccines and it's currently falling apart partially because of these bi lateral deals.

4873,The US gave Canada AZ doses and you still act like a spoiled child.

4875,In personal medicine people seem to over reach for silver bullets to any number of issues - E.g.
4876,"Vitamin D, Vitamin C, “no vac - I use my immunneeessystems!”, elk meat, fat loss pills."
4877,"The reality is, bodies are complex pieces of machinery."
4878,They need a bit of everything to be in balance and perform optimally.
4879,This notion includes the symphony of notes that is an immune system response.
4880,"So yes, people need to have adequate Vitamin D levels."
4881,And a lot of people don’t.
4882,"But getting 10, 20, 30x the Vitamin D from a pill doesn’t make you super man."
4883,It doesn’t make you immune to Covid.
4884,It just makes your body out of balance with the amount of Vitamin D that is needed.
4885,"So go out in the sun for a bit, or take supplements."
4886,"But don’t overdo it - it doesn’t help - It’s about balance, not exertion."
4887,Hey I had some questions about recent things that have been happening and my apologies if this isn’t the place.
4888,I’ve seen the general thoughts around the coronavirus being caused in a lab seems to be changing from less of a fringe idea.

5127,*
5128,Introverted people as a definition has been so bastardised at this point on reddit it's not even worth trying to change people's definitions.
5129,Introverted person means they recharge at home: not that they're anti-social.
5130,"I for example am introverted (I recharge at home, alone) but am extremely social."
5131,What you're talking about are anti-social people anyways....which seems to be a celebrated personality trait around here.
5132,Proved itself capable?
5133,A PCR test can be made at ANY community college in the US.
5134,It’s not some magical test.
5135,"That’s magnitudes away from building, staffing, and running a lab to make mRNA vaccines."
5136,"So we are talking years and years just to build the facilities, think about that, even if the patent were released the lab wouldn’t be build for years, well after the pandemic is over."
5137,"If they wanted to help, they’d make the precursors, those are largely free from patent and in short supply (proving that patents alone do not hinder development, people cant just make anything at the drop of a hat)."
5138,Could have done better?
5139,They rolled out two effective vaccines in a calendar year that are safer and more effective than anything else developed anywhere.
5140,"Yes there were delays in scale, we were supposed to have 100m doses by the end of 2020, it took much longer to get there."
5141,"If the guys who have been living and breathing mRNA vaccines for a decade had issues getting the plants they designed up to full capacity with the US government using the DPA to source rare supplies, do you really think any scientist in a country with no notable native vaccine production could possibly get production of a cutting edge vaccine done in a reasonable amount of time with just the patent information on the vaccine itself."
5142,Just think about that.
5143,A highly complex biotechnology and you think that some completely inexperienced scientists who aren’t native English speakers could effectively develop a way to make the vaccine and it’s lipid delivery system while there’s a global shortage of materials.
5144,And that upstart could some how bring that vaccine to market in a meaningful time frame?
5145,It’s not like Moderna or Pfizer have spare bodies lying around to send to as an advisor to build a plant that will be complete well after the pandemic is over.
5146,"I mean that’s a complete waste of manpower when we need to maximize the production we do have to end the virus now, not in 2-4 years when that plant gets up and running."
5147,What argument?
5148,Most people in here complaining that the US is dumb and bad for not giving more vaccines away sooner are European or Canadian
5149,&gt;Do you know of a better way to get out multiple vaccines for one virus and begin mass production/distribution within a year?
5150,I don't know and I saying that this system is bad and needs overhaul does not mean that I have the burden of making a proposal on this.

5162,"Secondly, what do you expect?"
5163,"We've done this for a year and we're seeing the results of vaccination, cases and deaths are in freefall."
5164,The vaccine works.
5165,Let's call this what it is: fear mongering.
5166,"Caution is making sure vaccinated people may still get covid and if they do to stay home and get a test, constantly pretending there's a monster on the other side of the hill is fear."
5167,Theres a difference.
5168,These are getting downvoted because they ignore the reality of our situation.
5169,"Natural infection creates antibodies against all parts of the virus, including the spike."
5170,I vaguely remember reading that there’s a type of antibody test that can tell which one(s) you have.
5171,It's not about me.
5172,It's not entirely the fault of western governments.
5173,It's the fault of the WHO and international health institutions.
5174,From the very start they should have prepared.
5175,The COVAX program was very promising but it was too little too late.
5176,Both from an ethical and a pragmatic point of view what we needed was global equitable distribution of vaccines.
5177,"Yes, it's ""taxpayer money"" and so on but this issue is above money."
5178,People should really be ok with knowing that something they paid for is helping people that they don't know on the other side of the globe.
5179,Because it indirectly but inevitably means they also get a benefit from this.
5180,The pandemic is not over before it is so everywhere.
5181,Second shirts are starting in earnest now
5182,What part of NJ are you in if you don't mind me asking?

5188,"No, I'm not saying that at all."
5189,I'm saying the US could be sending vaccines to American embassies for the number of citizens they know they have in country.
5190,"Those of us in Canada are the ones in the least danger, honestly."
5191,It's the Americans in random countries elsewhere that could really be helped by such a program.
5192,Younger age groups aren’t eligible for the vaccine yet so it’s spreading fast in our groups bcos obviously age groups mostly mix with each other
5193,My whole argument is that it's a minor inconvenience in exchange for a courtesy.
5194,"If you don't think it's a minor inconvenience and that wearing it is so uncomfortable, that says more about you and how much you care about your fellow human."
5195,Have you just never worn a mask for long enough that you got used to it?
5196,"It's like you're complaining about having to wear a shirt into a restaurant, would you not think someone like that is so mentally weak that they can't suck it up and put on a shirt in that situation?"
5197,"Calling a shirt uncomfortable is subjective, but it's not like that subjectivity makes my argument any weaker."
5198,&gt;This is part of developing a vaccine.
5199,"If you call it so, then call the vaccine Fosun-Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine."
5200,The whole pharmaceutical system needs a total overhaul.
5201,It clearly isn't working.
5202,Not only the vaccines.
5203,Money should never decide who gets to live or not.
5204,This is an ethical axiom.
5205,I'm not sure.
5206,"But if I recall, the mRNA just creates the same spike protein, and the antibodies from a natural covid infection created by targeting the spike protein would be the same."
5207,"And if there's no surge 2 weeks after memorial day, it'll be wait and see after the 4th of July then next."
5208,Why is it so hard for some people to admit the vaccine is working...
5209,&gt; I suspect it's still in place because they don't want to reward people traveling to the US to get the vaccine.
5210,Probably the most nonsensical reason you could think of.
5211,"There is no vaccine passport, when that is implemented you will see changes."
5212,😂 Dude that's so funny.
5213,Idk what's with people and holding such a high value on political views anyway.
5214,"Like bro, get off Fox and get a hobby."
5215,My dad does three things...
5216,"Politics, cook, complain."
5217,"Every day of this shit has been painful, and my mental health has completely disintegrated over the last year."
5218,I cannot wait for life to get back to normal so much I'd cut off a finger if that expedited the process.
5219,Safe to it's tough for me to understand this reopening anxiety.
5220,To me this has been the worst year ever.
5221,So what you’re asking for is the US to get Canada - a sovereign nation - to change its border rules?
5222,That’s not going to happen.
5223,Repatriation is one thing.
5224,I’ve witnessed that.
5225,"But for what you’re describing, what is your embassy saying?"
5226,"Kent variant is UK ""Alpha"" variant."
5227,People outside UK don't necessarily know what Kent is.
5228,"Now, unless I read the report wrong, the case fatality of Delta variant is very low, that would be a good news."
5229,I’m pretty sure they can differentiate since the vaccine only gives you antibodies against the spike but infection gives you others also.
5230,"I don't watch utube but have 100% distrust in this government, especially the way they have conducted themselves throughout so I'm not hesitant, it's a no from me to the vaccine &amp; before anyone starts racking off at me I'm not anti vax 🙄"
5231,That's why COVAX existed.
5232,Moderna has been approved for 16 year olds in the US since the 1st approval.
5233,There's been no significant side effects in that age group different from adults.
5234,There has been a few cases of heart inflammation cited as potentially associated at younger ages with mRNA.
5235,Those are still under investigation and an extremely small percentage vs number of vaccines given.
5236,"If they are even all assumed to be vaccine driven, there still seems to be a decently higher risk of heart inflammation from covid among young adults vs the vaccine."
5237,And they may not all be vaccine driven.
5238,The UK has 51 cases per million.
5239,Portugal has 54.
5240,Is the UK on the UK list of safe countries?
5241,Why in the world is this news?
5242,"While I agree it isn’t a high priority, I think it’s going to happen either way."
5243,"So helping reduce the impact it would have is good

Also, Japan a needs help anyway."
5244,I don’t like how articles like this always imply that people who are anxious about returning to normal have social anxiety.
5245,"I’m really dreading a full on return to normal because I would rather spend my time at home with my family than getting sucked back into commuting to work, going to work social functions and on work trips and having to return to social obligations like seeing family more often or going to parties hosted by friends or acquaintances."
5246,"I don’t have social anxiety, but I prefer spending time with my wife and kids over other people (especially over work socializing)."
5247,I know people who are excited for a return to the office and I just don’t get it.
5248,"I'm not being given a free cure, and I'm Turkish, from Turkey which is a traditional US ally."
5249,This seems very unethical to me.
5250,To decide if someone'll die or live based on what their government does.
5251,That one's my secret.
5252,I keep it vague online lmao
5253,CDC reported it too among US cases: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/myocarditis.html

5262,"This missing relation prompts others to ask ""and?""."
5263,"Since the relation is unknown, its up to anyone's intepretation."
5264,The US didn't give Canada fuck all.
5265,They loaned doses they couldn't use.
5266,So generous.
5267,I was fully vaccinated in Feb.

5274,I'm American living in Canada and can't come back to the US to get a second dose because of Canada's border restrictions.
5275,Pretty sure there are thousands of American citizens in a similar situation as I am.
5276,"The CDC page has a category for ""&lt;12"", and it is a non 0%."
5277,"Why is this, does it count ongoing studies, and if that is not why it exists, where else can I take my &lt;12 kids to get legally vaccinated now?"

5284,The fact Trump had a broken clock moment and might have gotten part of this right is clearly a problem for the discussion.
5285,People from all backgrounds seem incapable of setting his bullshit and craziness aside and just examining the matter at hand.
5286,It’s maddening.
5287,But I would submit that not having a discussion because of who might comment cedes the forum to the crackpots.
5288,To show that the flu is not deadlier than the covid for young children.
5289,"Comparing the 2019/2020 pediatric flu deaths to the 2020/2021 pediatric covid deaths in the US is not fair, because of the safety measures put in place in 2020/2021."
5290,Comparing the 2020/2021  pediatric flu deaths to the 2020/2021 pediatric covid deaths in the US is better and more straightforward.
5291,But for some reason one of the redditors did not make this comparison in one of the parent comments.
5292,Another possibility to assess the severity of the covid and flu viruses for children is to look elsewhere.
5293,There are multiple examples that show that the flu is not deadlier than the covid.
5294,Different parts of the country are so strange to me.
5295,I was elated when my hair stylist told me she was fully vaccinated.

5300,"tbh i was a little worried about quebec delaying 2nd doses for 16 weeks, but now im so glad that it paid off (got my 1st shot 2 weeks ago)"
5301,"At this point, the vast majority of those testing positive are idiots that refuse the vaccine."
5302,They're getting what they deserve.
5303,The statistics are clear.
5304,Close to 90%  or above of deaths  are in people who arent fully vaccinated.
5305,Once 75% of adults are fully vaccinated numbers should drop.
5306,The government also possibly missed.
5307,a trick by not banning flights from India soon enough I think.
5308,Though America never did that and Im wondering if thats really the cause(as opposed to not enough vaccinations).

5370,They must not be capturing all the positive cases if 10 plus people are dying every day.
5371,Vietnam is also reporting low hundred cases per day but they might have 1 death a day only.
5372,Really need to increase testing capacity to get a better idea of how many cases there actually are.
5373,I wouldn't fawn over Sinovac either.
5374,Both are proving to be insufficient to drive down cases in multiple countries.
5375,Chile is almost entirely Coronavac and is struggling to contain a surge ever since they began to reopen.
5376,"They are giving a false sense of confidence to the population when really they are only borderline effective after two doses (50% protection from symptoms, 70% protection from hospitalization and death) and useless after one (literally, Coronovac is only estimated to be 3% effective after one dose)."
5377,And those efficacy numbers are before considering vaccine evasion from some strains that may push that down even further.
5378,"These numbers are illustrative only, but if the SA variant drops Pfizer from ~95% to 85-90%, then that same drop will likely put a fully vaccinated coronavac individual down something like 30% - which is just not good enough."
5379,"This has nothing to do with ""China bad!"""
5380,"or somehow implying that they are making a ""bad"" product."
5381,"The vaccines are definitely better than nothing, but clearly old school inactivated viruses are showing their weakness relative to the modern miracles that are mRNA vaccines (and viral vector for that matter)."

5400,I live in a suburb in Kentucky and last I checked the vax rate for my county was right around 50% of adults.
5401,"But our cases have tanked hard, with 0-2 new cases per day, it’s been weeks since we had a day with more than 2."
5402,So does that mean that 3% of cases are people who have been vaccinated?
5403,!
5404,"Yeah I'm all for vaccinating everyone including teens and children, but it makes sense to prioritize those over 18 first, especially those in their 30s and 40s who still have a relatively higher risk of being hospitalized due to Covid-19."
5405,"In my small office, everyone that comes in gets a temp and blood oxygen check before work every day, pretty much since the beginning of this."
5406,"I think all or nearly all of us are vaccinated by now, but it’s still standard process."
5407,"If anyone feels sick at all, they cannot come in."
5408,A lot of the company has been remote.

5411,"On the main Coronavirus Reddit page, click on the three little dots on the top right corner and then go to ""change user flair""."
5412,I don’t understand how the flu is more deadly when we had no cases.
5413,"That means covid is more dangerous than flu because our measures contained flu, but not the virus."
5414,"At any rate, the comparison to the flu has been shown repeatedly to be worthless."
5415,This virus is different and more dangerous than the flu.
5416,"Maybe some people don’t care if kids get sick, as long as they don’t die."

5423,"One of my father’s best friends got sick before the peak of the surge; he spent weeks in an ICU, only to be told at the end of the stay that he owed a sum far beyond what he had expected."
5424,"Yeah like some people are like ""nooo don't be selfish online classes are goooood don't spread corona maaann""

5431,He was out of the office for 2 weeks and he still considers it a mild case?
5432,Well I guess he is alive but I haven’t even had a flu that lasted more than a week
5433,My 5 yo goes to a preschool in a dominant blue area but her ant-vax teacher was refusing to wear a mask after the restrictions for the public were lifted (honors code if you’re vaccinated) .
5434,She straight up told parents she was not vaccinated but was not worried about herself.
5435,My wife expressed concern yesterday about the situation and the teacher responded in an aggressive way about giving her a refund if she wanted for the month of June.
5436,Well last night we got an email from the teacher/school saying 2 kids have now tested positive for covid in our daughters class.
5437,SMH...we now wonder if the unvaccinated teachers gave it to them or if now they have it?
5438,"Either way, we are keeping her out of her class for now."

5481,&gt; This has been a whirlwind of combating misinformation AND learning as we go.
5482,Very true.
5483,"However, the majority of the misinformation is targeted, with the aim of causing more deaths."
5484,I'll just ignore anything coming from a layperson that implies that people shouldn't get vaccinated as soon as possible.
5485,"Up until recently, I'd also ignore anything arguing that safety measures were unnecessary."
5486,"So that's part of it, but the other part is that propaganda, while effective, is not usually entirely subtle."
5487,"Propaganda victims often use what I call ""cargo cult arguments,"" where they parrot phrases they've heard in other contexts without really understanding what they're saying."
5488,"For example, a week or two ago, you'd see people coming out of the woodwork saying ""trust the science"" in an effort to get people to stop wearing masks."
5489,This meets both of my conditions.
5490,"It seems to be oddly aggressive about a common safety measure, and it uses a particular set phrase that has turned into a bit of a shibboleth."
5491,I guess that's a third thing.
5492,"People all of a sudden repeating the same message, even if it's something that doesn't quite make sense."
5493,My favorite recent example of this is people saying that wearing a mask until cases drop somehow implies a lack of belief that vaccines work.
5494,It's a bit of a two-fer in that it allows the propaganda victim to attack masks while also managing to sneak in a negative comment about vaccines.

I just don't see any path from 62.8% to 70% over the next 31 days."
5590,The daily increment is averaging 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points and is declining.
5591,"If it remained constant, we'd end up between 65.9% and 69.0% on July 4."
5592,"Accounting for the decline, we'll probably end up between 64%-65%."
5593,The government should be adjusting the messaging NOW.
5594,"It might strike some as disingenuous for the government to announce 65% as the new good-enough target, but the alternative is a target that simply is not met by July 4 and which will become apparent has no chance of being met at all by the end of the Summer."
5595,Political horseshoe theory - the fringes of either side loop back to each other.

5601,"Even if there aren't any people who *can't* get a vaccine, there will be some for whom it is less likely to work because of problems with the immune system."
5602,This is exactly why *everyone* should get it.
5603,Vaccines work on a population level.
5604,"I'm not particularly worried about catching COVID right now, but that's because I'm vaccinated *and* because my area has almost no new cases."
5605,The latter reason came about because most people here are vaccinated.
5606,Denial really do be the first step
5607,Apparently scientists learn new stuff during an unfolding scientific situation.
5608,My OBs office does seem to be a little stricter than some.
5609,But most I've heard only still allow spouses for 12 and 20 week if they allow at all.
5610,Mine allows for none.

5613,I think you have to love Spam (the canned meat thing) to join the Hawaii culture.
5614,Yes there are lots of people who are skeptical of the CDCs recommendations after 18 months of neverending mistakes and lies.
5615,Especially after they came out with their new mask recommendations which was clearly an attempt to get unvaccinated people to take the shot and not based on the reality of the pandemic.
5616,I am still wearing an n95 when I absolutely have to go in somewhere and I am vaccinated.
5617,The studies showing vaccine efficacy are six months old at this point and the CDC has said they are no longer tracking breakthrough cases unless someone ends up in the hospital.
5618,We are flying blind and it is reasonable to take precautions so as to not get hit as the virus continues to evolve and possibly escapes the vaccine immunity.
5619,"Unless you’re fully vaccinated of course, then lick away :)"
5620,Well I was half right.
5621,Vaccinated people don’t need testing if they’ve been around a covid positive person and showing no symptoms.
5622,So different than unvaccinated since they recommend you to get tested under the same circumstance.
5623,The article makes no sense because testing between the 2 groups is not the same so how can you compare?
5624,Probably because people touch the chairs then go outside and take off their masks without washing their hands.
5625,"In the meantime there are forces making sure to do everything possible to spin the world their way while we real from whats happening to our friends, family and neighbors."
5626,Its not just the pandemic that will never go away--- the seeds that have been sown in the meantime will grow into giant evil oak trees.

5642,"Once we have 75% of the entire population done, *then* we will be reaching herd immunity."
5643,"As it is, we are not quite there."
5644,"The good news is that vaccines being used do work against the Indian variant, so we need to push to have as many people as possible given at least their first vaccine."
5645,Someone else posted a link that said 75% are vaccinated.
5646,"So if 97% of the cases occur in 25% of the population and 3% occurs in 75% of the population, then that's about a 99% efficacy at preventing COVID in the first place."

The experimental drug TEMPOL may be a promising oral antiviral treatment for COVID-19, suggests a study of cell cultures by researchers at the National Institutes of Health."

5668,The work was led by researchers at NIH’s Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD).
5669,The study appears in Science.
5670,A short answer is that this virus does not have a nationality and does what it does regardless of where it is.
5671,"Although there are variants, they seem to be imported/exported very easily without restrictions."
5672,"A longer answer is that although the situation is much much better right now in the US than elsewhere in the world, it is NOT due to the covid being weaker than the flu."
5673,"It is due to the relatively widespread vaccines and, more importantly, it is due to the many sacrifices healthcare workers and parents have made so far."
5674,The risk calculation differs family to family.
5675,But there are still many parents in the US who don't want to take risks with their unvaccinated children.
5676,"It is just untrue that ""children aren't at risk for covid"" or ""the flu is literally more deadly than covid for young children"" 

There was also an article in Lancet saying that ""Our results demonstrate that relaxing social distancing measures for vaccinated individuals would have minimal impact on incidence, but extending such guidelines to other individuals before adequate vaccination of children could fuel a rapid rise in COVID-19 cases, hospitalisations, and deaths."""

For example Hungary has largely suppressed their outbreaks and have essentially approved all the big American, British, Russian, Chinese vaccines, but it's highly doubtful they are using a large amount of Chinese vaccines given how successful they have been and the vaccines' spotty record elsewhere."
5700,The actual content of the emails quoted here is total nothingburger.
5701,"Claiming that Fauci or any respondents said the virus ""can't develop naturally"" is completely disingenuous."

5710,"I'm sure there are a few vile enough to want that, but most wouldn't."
5711,"Instead, it's more about them viewing it as permission."
5712,"In their eyes, giving the vaccine is like telling their kid it's OK to go have sex."
5713,"Which is sort of odd, because I'm sure they don't view getting their kids car insurance as permission to go drive into a tree."
5714,"But alas, that's what it seems to be about."
5715,Same thing with sex education and contraception.
5716,"Teaching them about protecting themselves is seen as permission, so it's better to keep them uninformed and hope they're too scared to have sex (lol...good luck with that)."

6134,You don't even get the real Polio virus *in* the vaccine.
6135,"What they are probably referring to is the Oral Polio Vaccine, which hasn't been used in the US for 20+ years."
6136,&gt;A vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) is a strain of the weakened poliovirus that was initially included in oral polio vaccine (OPV) and that has changed over time and behaves more like the wild or naturally occurring virus.
6137,"This means it can be spread more easily to people who are unvaccinated against polio and who come in contact with the stool or respiratory secretions, such as from a sneeze, of an infected person."
6138,"These viruses may cause illness, including paralysis."
6139,"&gt;For this reason, the global eradication of polio requires stopping all OPV in routine immunization, as soon as possible after the eradication of wild poliovirus (WPV) transmission."
6140,"To protect against all three types of WPV, the United States exclusively has used IPV since 2000."
6141,"For more information on OPV cessation, please visit the Global Polio Eradication Initiative’s websiteexternal icon."
6142,Basically the oral vaccine had a weak version of the virus that mutated and can spread to unvaccinated people.
6143,&gt; The occurrence of iVDPVs is very rare.
6144,Only 111 cases have been documented worldwide since 1962.

Taipei, June 3 (CNA) Health and Welfare Minister Chen Shih-chung (陳時中) said Thursday said that Taiwan seems headed for a new peak in COVID-19 cases, as 585 new infections and 17 deaths from the disease were reported earlier in the day."
6270,"Of the 585 cases, 583 were classified as domestic infections -- with 364 newly confirmed and 219 reported from a backlog of test results over the past two weeks."
6271,"While the total number of cases on Thursday was slightly lower than the previous day, it was higher than on Tuesday, Chen noted at a Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) press briefing."
6272,"The latest numbers are ""not a good sign,"" he said, adding that it will be become clearer in a few days whether Taiwan is approaching a new peak."
6273,"Meanwhile, the percentage of COVID-19 patients in the 20-39 age group has climbed from 19.9 percent to 25.2 percent in the past two days, Chen said, cautioning young people in particular, and everyone else, to continue to follow the CECC's disease prevention regulations."
6274,He said young people may be letting their guard down because of a decline in the number of cases reported last week.
6275,"However, ""we cannot afford to be overly optimistic now,"" he said."
6276,"CECC data on Thursday showed that New Taipei and Taipei remained the two main COVID-19 hotspots, reporting 265 and 224 domestic cases, respectively."
6277,"Miaoli County reported 34, Taoyuan 30, Changhua County 15, Taichung five, and Keelung four."
6278,"Tainan confirmed two cases, while one each was reported in Hsinchu and Kaohsiung cities and Hualien and Yilan counties."
6279,"Of the 583 total domestic cases, 14 had unknown sources of infection, and three were under investigation, the CECC said."
6280,"The two imported COVID-19 cases reported Thursday involved Indonesian and Vietnamese nationals who came to Taiwan to work, according to the CECC."
6281,"The 17 fatalities were 13 men and four women, aged 40-100, who passed away between May 28 and June 1, the data showed."
6282,"Taiwan has confirmed a total of 9,974 COVID-19 cases, 8,500 of which are domestic infections reported since May 15, when the country first recorded more than 100 cases in a single day."
6283,"The number of confirmed COVID-19 deaths in the country has risen to 166, including 154 recorded since May 15, CECC data shows."

6343,This is the first time a state has locked down since the federal government stopped wage and business handouts.
6344,The state government is trying to force the federal government to resume the handouts while they are locked down.
6345,The federal government wants the states to stop locking down at a tiny number of cases and handle this the way New South Wales has.
6346,The states don't want to do that because they've always handled it by lockdowns and not trusting their contact tracers.
6347,Basically the Victoria is bigging up the virus so they can justify locking down at a few dozen cases.

6379,This is artificially lowering our numbers and holding us back.
6380,I suspect there’s going to be a lot of questions once the CDC shows us over 70% but we’re still not open.
6381,The distribution is being left to the 20 DHBs which are widely acknowledged as being incompetent and are already having widely variable roll-outs for Phase 3.
6382,The plan calls for such an incredible rate of vaccination in October/November that I just don't see it as feasible.
6383,Also I expect us to run into a bit of apathy and hesitancy due to the lack of any actual risk from Covid in the country.

&amp;#x200B;

Prof Gupta told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the UK was already in a third wave of infections and at least **three quarters of cases were the variant identified in India."
6400,"**  
He said: ""Of course the numbers of cases are relatively low at the moment - all waves start with low numbers of cases that grumble in the background and then become explosive, so the key here is that what we are seeing here is the signs of an early wave."""
6401,"However, he said the number of people who had been vaccinated in the UK meant **this wave would probably take longer to emerge than previous ones."
6402,"**  
**""There may be a false sense of security for some time, and that's our concern."
6403,"""**

&amp;#x200B;

But Prof Gupta - a member of the government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) - **said ending restrictions in June should be delayed ""by a few weeks whilst we gather more intelligence""."
6404,"**  
Meanwhile, Dr Chaand Nagpaul, council chairman of the British Medical Association, said the UK was at a ""pivotal moment"" in its battle against the virus, and called on ministers to ""act with maximum caution when considering whether to go ahead with lifting restrictions"" on 21 June."
6405,You are quoting local uptakes in numbers whereas I am referring more to nationwide numbers.
6406,"My main point is that despite a cluster of potential spreader events that happened over a two month period (and I forgot to mention Easter) there has still been a continued nationwide downturn in cases, hospitalizations, and deaths."
6407,Our health systems are also not currently in danger of being overrun.
6408,Do I think unvaccinated people should proceed with caution?
6409,Off course but these people probably were not taking covid seriously even when there was no vaccine.
6410,If you are fully vaccinated you should live your life free of worry of covid for the most part.
6411,If you want to keep wearing a mask that is cool with me too and I respect that.

6417,"I am rarely on Reddit because I have been volunteering my time with a group of health professionals including doctors, nurses, and even an expert in biosafety and security who donates their time to public health in local communities to develop safety plans regarding the pandemic."
6418,All people with rather intimate knowledge I trust more than the evening news.
6419,"Mind you my ""keyboard warring"" was getting KN95 and other respirator-type masks in the hands of people working with the public well over a year before the CDC/WHO accepted the clear science that aerosol spread was a major factor."
6420,We don't need lockdowns for the rest of our lives.
6421,They are only a temporary tool of last resort to get the community spread to zero.
6422,Better monitoring can allow them to be smaller and targeted to specific regions too.
6423,"After that, the quarantine of incoming people is the tough part that needs to be maintained until more of the world is vaccinated."
6424,Several countries have been able to live pretty close to normal over the last year with such strategies in place including Taiwan which had a stretch of 8 months with 0 local cases.
6425,It is a lot of work at the forefront but it allows much more life with normalcy while saving lives and keeping transmission low to slow the mutations that can set us back.
6426,Elimination over mitigation is also better overall for the economy and civil rights which are ironically the excuses often used to water down restrictions and open too early.
6427,We need to accept we've been shortsighted when looking at the bigger picture that includes working examples we can build from.
6428,&gt;The trade-off between different objectives is at the heart of political decision making.
6429,"Public health, economic growth, democratic solidarity, and civil liberties are important factors when evaluating pandemic responses."
6430,There is mounting evidence that these objectives do not need to be in conflict in the COVID-19 response.
6431,"Countries that consistently aim for elimination—ie, maximum action to control SARS-CoV-2 and stop community transmission as quickly as possible—have generally fared better than countries that opt for mitigation—ie, action increased in a stepwise, targeted way to reduce cases so as not to overwhelm health-care systems."

6455,And yet us here in Ontario are still locked down until August!
6456,"Plus another test to enter the country, plus a 4th test if you want to end quarantine early."
6457,Those cheaper companies are notorious for being very delayed getting sent out too.

6463,"Well, I don't disagree, but I also don't see how it relates to the topic."
6464,The point I am making is that world vaccination rates might drop when Chinese stop administering 20 million per day in their own county and nobody elsewhere buys them.

6575,"&gt;A rollout of vaccines has led to a dramatic drop in the number of cases, hospitalizations and deaths nationwide, a trend the White House is eager to extend."
6576,"The White House touted new initiatives by private companies and public outreach efforts, while Biden encouraged those who are hesitant to get a shot."
6577,The teetotaling president lauded an announcement by Anheuser-Busch (ABI.BR) to give a free beer to adults over the age of 21 if the goal is reached.
6578,Shocking
6579,nobody couldve seen this coming.
6580,"it was an act of a god, a true force of nature."
6581,there was nothing we could do about it
6582,[removed]
6583,"For what it's worth, consider showing him how many people in your country/globally the flu usually kills each year (one of few positive things to come out of all this is that the safety precautions for Covid-19 have caused flu cases and deaths to plunge)."
6584,"Also, that most of the time people think they had the 'flu', it was actually a much milder different respiratory virus."
6585,"When people get the flu, they sure know it because of how bad the experience can be."
6586,Canada has open availability for everyone 12+ now.
6587,At the moment we are finishing up the last of the age based people and moving on to second shots.
6588,There is probably going to still be a few weeks of slower but steady first shots as we finish up the younger population and people that were not in a hurry.
6589,Mississippi will most likely not get 50% without some Devine intervention.
6590,It's been 2 days since my 1st shot of astrazeneca.
6591,Ask your questions
6592,"100,000k if 0.4% extrapolates evenly out as you increase sample size."
6593,"Considering 0.2% is baseline, that is theoretically maybe 50,000 kids potentially that experience one outside of the norm?"
6594,That's if that holds.
6595,"If, for some reason, we did see numbers of that nature, I would expect pullback or pause on Pfizer to determine if there is a causal link and a serious risk of illness or death in children."
6596,And it's not like every kid should get them.
6597,There are legit contraindications.
6598,I guess I don't see any reason they shouldn't be allowed to if they've asked their pediatrician about it.
6599,I still think from a public health standpoint the risk to reward ratio of reduced transmission and reducing their albeit small chances of COVID while also allowing them the ability to participate in activities they would otherwise be prohibited from or masked for is worth it.
6600,"Of course, the last component is non medical, but has to be worth considering for kids who that may be a barrier to (sports, school, camps, family, etc) 

It's also worth noting the American Academy of Pediatrics does endorse the Pfizer vaccine."
6601,"If there was any group of professionals I'd trust to determine if it is a good recommendation for teens, it'd be them."
6602,Wish my family members would get it 😔
6603,"Basically the link between the right and more fringe beliefs like anti-vax, anti-gay, anti-abortion, anti-universal healthcare etc."
6604,doesn't exist nearly as much in Britain.
6605,Mentioning your religion would get you laughed out of the room in any political debate.
6606,"You get nutters on all sides of the spectrum, but broadly there's less polarisation on fundamental issues than you seem to get in the US."
6607,As far as vaccines go there is no mainstream anti-vax movement and no credible politicians or celebrities would back it.
6608,"Moreover, the NHS has been delivering the programme, and most people implicitly trust the NHS and follow its guidance far more than any government."
6609,The whole country is about to open back up.
6610,If Biden hits his goal of July 4th with 70% vaccinations in the country.
6611,"It's a PR win, he is withdrawing American troops from Afghanistan on Sept 11th, 2021 the 20th anniversary, it's another PR political win."
6612,Sept 13th is the deadline to lift the mask mandate at federal buildings but I can see that getting extended.
6613,I mean we have full arenas for the playoffs.
6614,I just don't see a major outbreak.
6615,I hope.
6616,"If vaccine trends are getting you down, just look at cases, hospitalizations, deaths, or % positive rates over the past few weeks."
6617,There’s a medical term for that; No Shit!
6618,I am the same!
6619,Had mine Tuesday and I warned the lady giving it to me that I have passed out from fear in the past.
6620,"Sure enough, 30 seconds or so after my jab I was confused why there were three more ladies around me and my mask was off."
6621,I totally passed out.
6622,They told me next time I get to lie in a bed when I get my jab.
6623,Getting the needle was the painless part.
6624,"The localized pain from having the vaccine was the painful part...

Dunno why they'd want to reinvent he wheel on this one."
6625,Lol
6626,Because we have to end this.
6627,We can’t keep worrying about surges for the rest of our lives.
6628,It’s too defeatist.
6629,"I’m still careful, wear a mask, socially distance, etc but I don’t want to hear anymore bad news about covid."
6630,It’s enough.
6631,Second doses have been brought forward to counter the delta/indian variant.
6632,"Now the wait is 8 weeks instea of 11 weeks, and there is talk of further reducing the gap between doses."
6633,The fear mongering articles like this never helped.
6634,In fact I think the ridiculous unsupported claims like it majorly fueled the anti-maskers.
6635,They see the ridiculous claims and then think it's all made up.
6636,I'm very glad to see a shift here to respecting the solid data over fear mongering.
6637,"Except that Victoria (ALP) has had the worst response among states, while NSW has done quite well."
6638,I’m not a Liberal fan but this seems a bit...generous...for Labor.

6645,One of his emails was from some health official in early Feb asking about masks and that was his response.
6646,I think it was fairly well known that it was doing very little to protect you from the virus inbound as I heard that repeated many times on this sub.
6647,Not really.
6648,Even just one dose is very good protection.
6649,"Of course, people should get both if it’s recommended, but one dose is still progress."
6650,Certain parties like to position themselves as progs but seem to be allergic to universal programs.
6651,Totally understand and I cant even imagine.
6652,I really feel sorry for anyone living alone downtown in a city somewhere.
6653,This year must have been hell.
6654,I think you guys have done an amazing job but that sounds pretty depressing.
6655,So now you guys get to live a normal life with no Covid and no restrictions (except for international tourism) and once everyone is vaccinated you'll have to start following restrictions and living with Covid?
6656,Taxes will pay for it.
6657,What a surprise.
6658,It's not about being introverted or extroverted.

6672,None.
6673,Then that's on you.
6674,You want to drink with friends.
6675,Fine.
6676,How many virtual bar crawls did you set up with them?
6677,When the pandemic waned over the summer how many times did you tell people to BYOB and invite them over to your place to hang out outside in the backyard and drink?
6678,None?
6679,Then that's on you.
6680,Like to travel?
6681,I did a virtual trip to Disneyworld since I couldn't do a real one.
6682,How much time did you spend mucking around on Google Maps and seeing places you probably wouldn't otherwise?
6683,How many times did you load up the car and go off to a park in the next state?
6684,None?
6685,Then that's on you.
6686,"If you chose to sit at home and do nothing instead of doing things that brought you joy, then that's 100% on you and no one else."
6687,"If you truly expect that every year of your life will go exactly how you planned it, you are wildly mistaken and you're going to spend a lot of years sitting at home alone."

6691,"Just to note, some of the things we did against COVID, particularly early on, were based on a ""flu"" model of transmission, hence the early fear of fomites and droplet spread."
6692,"We still do a lot of Clorox wipes on surfaces, and have some stuff to deal with droplets, e.g., plexiglass barriers."
6693,"This stuff won't do much for COVID (because it's primary means of spreading is aerosols), but may do a number on the flu."
6694,The media is going to keep milking Covid.
6695,"No Trump to generate headlines that elicit an emotional response, and outside of Covid nothing really crazy is going on."
6696,The rollout has been so fucked here
6697,Easter is a bigger family gathering day than Memorial Day and had no associated surge.

6735,"I did not fill out the site, but I did get a call from the board of health of my town and they interviewed me and sent the data off to my state government."
6736,The testers did ask if I had been vaccinated.
6737,The thing also is that the 3% here is just one county.
6738,The number of vaccinated people who actually get or spread it overall everywhere is MUCH much lower.
6739,That was mainly because vaccinated people might have premarital sex without being punished by contracting HPV.

6741,Yes.

6745,"The point is though, that at the very least the EU is now announcing plans to reopen, and several EU countries have reopened."
6746,"The US has not even commented on the travel ban since it was kept in place by Biden in January (other than to add India), all the while allowing travel from countries dealing with COVID much worse than most Schengen countries and the UK."
6747,"If the US reopening to EU citizens were contingent on the EU opening to Americans, I think we'd have started to hear things by now, but there's been nothing other than baseless rumours."
6748,At the time it had little to do with the fact it was a vaccine and more to do with it being something that helped people avoid punishment for having sex.

6751,No?
6752,lol
6753,Yup.
6754,I remember I mentioned liking certain aspects of the pandemic on here a few months ago.
6755,Like not having to go to weddings anymore.
6756,Not having to go to parties I really don't want to.
6757,I'm introverted and asocial.
6758,The pandemic really didn't affect me at all.
6759,"In fact, I made a lot of self-improvements from not having to waste time on social interactions I really don't enjoy."
6760,Boy did I get lambasted for it by mentioning it.
6761,"That said, ""going back to normal"" hasn't really affected me."
6762,"I'm already going maskless in stores (yes, I'm vaccinated) and I'm back to my prepandemic levels of just generally not liking to be around other people, but doing it anyway because you pretty much have to in order to be successful."
6763,I think I might feign fear of COVID as an excuse to not go to any stupid weddings for as long as possible.
6764,"I have no idea why, but I hate those damned things more than anything else on this planet."
6765,And it's not because I'm not married.

&gt; This safety update report is based on detailed analysis of data up to 26 May 2021."
6776,"At this date, an estimated 14.0 million first doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and 24.3 million first doses of the COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca had been administered, and around 10.6 million and 13.4 million second doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca respectively."
6777,An approximate 0.4 million first doses of the COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna have also now been administered.
6778,"&gt;
&gt;As of 26 May 2021, for the UK, 64,450 Yellow Cards have been reported for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, 188,589 have been reported for the COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca, 2,469 for the COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna and 716 have been reported where the brand of the vaccine was not specified."
6779,"tldr:  

* 24.6m doses of Pfizer/BioNTech
* 37.7m doses of AZ
* 0.4m doses of Moderna"
6780,You’re absolutely right!
6781,We definitely need to stop being so dependent on them.
6782,Idk man… they can’t be trusted and I fear it’s only going to get worse.
6783,I hope I’m wrong.
6784,"I see, thx."
6785,But that means we still need to wait one or two months to see the result?
6786,As they need 2nd dose and another 14 days to be full immunized.
6787,Or you mean they already all get 2nd dose?
6788,Depends on what you watch.
6789,Frankly I’ve watched some YouTube types pull up the actual laws and read through them to go over where things are being spun from both sides of the aisle.
6790,It certainly helps having it on the screen with full context.
6791,It influenced me to look at the laws themselves and not waste my time watching news sources and to do actual legwork.
6792,It is pretty scary how many journalists don’t do the actual leg work and rely on circulating articles between each other on Twitter.
6793,"The minute it got mixed-up with a fragile collective identity, the US immunity timeline was done for"
6794,"Yes, exactly what I am saying."
6795,"The rate of severe symptoms per infected child may be still relatively low, i.e."
6796,lower than what we have seen with adults.
6797,"However, the absolute number of severe child cases can be significant without protective measures and appropriate care."
6798,This is definitely more alarming than what we have seen with the flu.

6807,The unvaccinated not wearing masks and infecting each other?
6808,( not a sarcastic question - everything I read is about  how it’s virtually only unvaccinated cases in the hospital but I haven’t found solid data on how many hospitalizations are unvaccinated compared to those who are vaccinated.
6809,I knew there were a few reports of elderly nursing home patients testing positive after vaccination and being hospitalized.)
6810,Individual events can cause spikes in states but it’s more the prolonged and consistent movement of people around seasons that I’m feeling worried about.
6811,I was in SF last year when we had fires so bad that they blotted out the sun for like a week and left the air completely trashed for weeks.
6812,SF was on the downward trend in cases when the weather and fires were at their worst up here.
6813,Fires causing people to go indoors doesn’t really track with cases.
6814,Especially because the peaks in SF and LA happened largely at the same time and went down at the same time.
6815,The fires were incidental.
6816,This link has cited sources.
6817,Conspiracy vids on YT do not.
6818,It's up to the viewer to suss-out the difference.
6819,I’m a Washington Post subscriber and I can’t easily  get through the paywall on comments like this.
6820,Irritating!
6821,No need to worry.
6822,Case numbers (at least in the States) are pretty low.
6823,I just got unlucky.
6824,You might want to get a rapid to give yourself peace of mind.
6825,I just assumed I had insanely bad allergies and I almost travelled to see family and I got a rapid test to be safe.
6826,I was the only positive case in my town (25k+ population) in the last few days.
6827,My anti-vac colleagues are using the 3% number to suggest that the vaccines are not safe.
6828,smh.
6829,"They should start refusing treatment unless the patient agrees to be vaccinated before being discharged from the hospital (or they sign a legally binding document saying they will be vaccinated within 3 months, provide proof to the county, and incur increasing fines daily if they miss this deadline.)"
6830,Or deny covid treatment to unvaccinated people who don’t have a legit medical exemption- period.
6831,Give 1 months notice to allow people plenty of time to at least get the 1st shot.
6832,After that you’re going to be on your own if you get severe covid.
6833,"At very least, insurance companies should deny coverage for any covid-related treatment to people who refuse vaccination and don’t have a medical exemption."
6834,Most of these folks need clear consequences in order to change their behavior - doing the right thing doesn’t matter to them.
6835,￼
6836,There are too many vested interests in the US (and other countries as well) that would make sure health insurance companies are positively never allowed to charge the obese higher premiums.

6847,"Yup totally get that, the problem with stupid people though, is that they’re stupid and a lot of them are stubborn too."
6848,lol like 21st century CNN would ever employ a real journalist
6849,My understanding is that reasonable people who are sincerely interested in determining how this virus made it into humans currently see either a jump from animals or an unintentional leak from a lab as the two most likely scenarios but without strong evidence yet for either.
6850,What no serious person is yet suggesting is that this was either intentionally released from a lab or unintentionally leaked from a lab doing bioengineering work to weaponize the virus.
6851,Those scenarios still remain firmly in the realm of disinfo and conspiracy theory.
6852,We now know that it takes a while to show symptoms.
6853,Who is to say they could not have been infected in Late September or early October?
6854,I mean that sort of makes the most sense.
6855,Oversimplifying is kind of the issue.
6856,"This is an aggregate site, and this link leads to an article with cited sources."
6857,The YT videos and Facebook posts about the flat earth and the incoming planet xenu and the government lizards... don't lead to articles with cited sources.

6870,.
6871,Thank you for your reply.
6872,"In the US there's a strong message that fully vaccinated people do not have to be concerned about transmitting the virus to others, so much so that the CDC does not recommend vaccinated people get tested for covid or quarantine if they know they have been in contact with a positive covid case."
6873,Singapore seems much more transparent about vaccinated people infecting others at times.
6874,What kind of messages does the government give about this?
6875,Do people openly acknowledge that vaccinated people infecting others is a public health risk and precautions and quarantine should be used?
6876,Herd immunity isn't some magic number.
6877,"In some areas of the country covid will remain as an endemic disease, in others it won't."
6878,"I think you have a misunderstanding of public policy if you think ""wait until herd immunity to drop the mandates"" is remotely effective or realistic in the US."
6879,I thought it’s that it is animal to human but that this transfer happened in a lab and not in the wild.
6880,Why would people trust the government?

6888,I’m so confused on who to believe now..
6889,My thoughts exactly.
6890,Japan is playing games with China and being as passive aggressive as possible.
6891,It could also be an attempt to get nurses from Taiwan to come over to Japan because their own are refusing to help with their Olympics...but I feel like this has more to do with giving China the finger than them just being kind.
6892,"Even that is a special exception... one family fully vaccinated, can't have another person who is fully vaccinated into their house for a coffee right now."

6895,Where’s Vietnam’s home grown vaccine then?
6896,"Oh, it’s more complicated than a test?"
6897,Surely they would have made it twice over by now if they could.
6898,"But they don’t have the infrastructure, the tech, or the means."
6899,"And beyond all that there’s still a shortage of precursor, vials, and syringes with current US based production."
6900,"Saying here’s how to make an mRNA DOESNT fix anything, infact as countries blunder while trying to start up it will only restrict supply a year from now when they finally can add production."
6901,"Remember, Pfizer and Moderna were making vaccine in bulk as they were testing it, it took a very long time to get production to this point."
6902,I'm 13 days into dose #2 (Moderna) and I woke up swimming in sweat last night.
6903,"I""ve had a bad throat and have been stuffy for the last few days."
6904,I'm just now putting it together this could be a side effect.

6984,Lol.
6985,Sure.
6986,"But if YOU get vaccinated, you're protected, and everyone around you is protected from you."
6987,People may have their own reasons for not getting vaccinated.
6988,"They may have had vaccine injuries in the past (they're rare, but more common than most people think)."
6989,"They may have already had the virus and recovered, and have natural acquired immunity."
6990,"They may be leery of the mRNA technology (Pfizer, Moderna), which has never been deployed on this scale before and has, at best, a 20 year track record of human trials."
6991,"They may be concerned about the blood clot issue with AstraZeneca, especially if they have a vascular condition."
6992,"And we know that some people, because of their specific health issues, either should not be vaccinated, or if they do get vaccinated won't be helped by it."
6993,"As someone who's been infected and recovered, I don't think I should be pressured into getting an unnecessary shot."
6994,"And frankly, while vaccines are still in short supply, I'm not going to take one away from someone who needs it when I do not."
6995,And we also need to consider that many people were infected and recovered without knowing it because they were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms.
6996,They will also now be immune.
6997,Herd immunity is not about how many people have been vaccinated.
6998,It's about how many people are immune.
6999,"Of myself, my husband and my 3 kids, only one was tested, but we've all had it."
7000,My nephew lost his sense of taste and smell for 3 weeks early last spring before the lockdowns.
7001,"His mother (who is a doctor) is 99% sure he had COVID, but because he didn't have severe respiratory symptoms and wasn't a health worker, he didn't qualify for a test at the time."
7002,This means more people have had it than have tested positive for it.
7003,It's entirely possible that herd immunity can be achieved with a 50% vaccination rate.
7004,"In my extended family alone, there are 5 people who've had COVID but were never tested, and one who had a positive test."
7005,"If 34 million people in the US have tested positive, based on my family's experience, there could be as many as 170 million people who've had it and are now immune."
7006,I suspect a lot of people who are getting vaccinated now have already had it and never knew it.
7007,"And there will be duplicate positive tests, as well."
7008,"But if herd immunity can be achieved at 75% of the population having immunity, we're well on our way with 50% vaccination rates."

7015,"I think momentum is huge, so even people who very early on may have been saying I'm not sure I'll get it don't now want to be the person who hasn't had it."
7016,Also we have had hard long lockdowns and although things are alot better now we don't want to go back to that and want to see more restrictions lifted asap.
7017,"But they don't know that for sure yet, right?"
7018,"I was under the impression you could still develop a mild case of even if you were vaccinated, and that the only thing the vaccine trials tested for was if it prevents a serious case that would require hospitalization."
7019,And if that is true then doesn't that kind of imply that people who don't develop symptoms aren't spreading the disease?
7020,If the vaccine just boosts your immune system to the point that it can fight the virus better then how is that any different from people whose immune systems were strong enough to fight it off with no vaccine?
7021,Here's a source claiming that COVID spreads most from people without any symptoms.

7207,CVS?
7208,Edit: San Diego
7209,From a viral safety I wouldnt be worried at all if your vaccinated.
7210,I would be more worried about whether France would still have restrictions(would it actually be fun to travel?)
7211,"I would suggest Iceland as an alternate destination(High vaccination, low restrictions)"

7215,Sister has a coworker that died fully vaccinated.
7216,They were over 80 and went to India where there were no hospital beds available at the time though.
7217,"Of my social circle, he's the only one we have hard of that has even gotten covid (at least symptomatically) after vaccination."
7218,&gt;That seemed like plausible medical advice to me.
7219,"No, its actually terrible."
7220,"There were some anesthesiologists, in particular, who wanted people to not get vaccinated within 48 hours BEFORE surgery because they were concerned about masking symptoms."
7221,This has rapidly shifted to ensuring people are fully vaccinated before ANY elective surgery because of the risks involved.
7222,None of that has anything to do with waiting to heal before getting vaccinated.
7223,"Stepping into a hospital without being fully vaccinated at this point in time, is a really poor idea."
7224,So you can admit there were in fact surges after those holidays.
7225,The vaccines don't guarantee you won't get it but they do pretty much guarantee you won't go to the hospital if you do get it.
7226,I am shocked.
7227,Who could have predicted this?
7228,"Kids can have needles, no problem, it's been like that since the dawn of vaccines, it's a tiny scratch for half a second not an invasive procedure."
7229,I love how these nurses are like David Blaine too using sleight of hand so that they've done it before you know
7230,Step 1.
7231,Don't be fat.
7232,Step 2.
7233,"Don't be old

Step 3."
7234,Don't have a serious illness.
7235,Then you are in a pretty good position.
7236,Nothing like Russian Roulette.
7237,Not those of us with young kids.
7238,[removed]
7239,Right now it’s the damage of not letting young kids have the vaccine vs the possible damage to those kids by a vaccine that millions of people have taken without serious issues.
7240,The Windsor mayor is unlikely to have any influence on the US Government.
7241,He's somewhat more likely to have influence (albeit still pretty unlikely) on the Canadian government.
7242,"Believe me, her friend circle is very pro-vax and this whole thing shocked us all."
7243,"The men, including my partner, have still gotten AZ but generally urged us women in that age group to not get it if there's another option, which is sensible."
7244,How is this interesting?
7245,Obviously unvaccinated people are the ones getting Covid.
7246,The fact that the number isn't 100% is odd lol.
7247,Feel pretty confident we’ll be damned
7248,"It doesn’t matter, it’s the only way to measure it."
7249,Would you lock down the entirety of society just to save a single life?
7250,"No, of course you wouldn’t."
7251,That doesn't really seem like terrible advice.
7252,Ideally you'd have the patient vaccinated with the whole series 2 weeks before the surgery instead of the day prior
7253,That’s scary.
7254,I hope you feel better soon.
7255,It's just the same headline that our local news station used that OP copied over.
7256,Antivax is the real cringe.
7257,you’re right.
7258,So by the third Easter perhaps?
7259,[removed]
7260,There was a case of a 40yo man that died in Canada because of clots post AstraZeneca.
7261,"But yes still the chance is extremely small, It may happen with any vaccine so and the chances of having some sequel with corona are much higher..."
7262,So time to be rational and go!
7263,"lol

My wife in the other hand had a thrombosis last year so she was absolutely forbidden by her doctor to use AZ."
7264,Although for the same reason she was considered priority group and have an appointment with Pfizer-Biontech :D
7265,"Hasn’t Australia kept case counts down with masks, distancing and the whole rigmarole?"
7266,Are the vaccines not available?
7267,Hope things change for you as far as vaccinations go.
7268,"As far as i know, there are no absolute contraindications to getting the covid vaccine besides allergies to the ingredients of the vaccine."
7269,"The people you listed should be able to get it, though In some cases there are concern that it won't produce as effective of an immune response."
7270,&gt;But Taiwan under DPP is so vehemently anti-china... that US analysts would know there zero chance that Taiwan will switch...
7271,"So even if they made the threat, the US can call them on their bluff."
7272,"Mostly fine, like the rest of Europe."
7273,Case counts (7 day moving average) have dropped from 35K at the start of April to around 9K and are still going down further.
7274,This case count is the lowest since September.
7275,Numbers for hospitalizations and deaths are in decline in the same way.
7276,"A phased reopening of businesses and activities is underway, with the next phase happening next week."
7277,"By the end of June, everything except for nightclubs should be open again."
7278,"I expect that by September, there won't be much left in terms of restrictions."
7279,Perhaps a few handgel dispensers at store entrances or so.
7280,[removed]
7281,[removed]
7282,You're a science denier.
7283,Half our family has autoimmune diseases and take medication that have a chance of making the vaccines less effective and covid more severe (like my dad who has multiple autoimmune diseases including one that affects his lungs).
7284,It does increase the risk if he isn't vaccinated.
7285,"And yes, the vaccines aren't 100% effective and most of the serious breakthrough cases have been in immunocompromised or elderly people so I don't see any issue about wanting the maximum protection possible for our family (i.e."
7286,everyone vaccinated not just one side).
7287,Everyone else has been visiting Gramma with no issues since being fully vaxxed.

Thanks."
7293,"I didn't know they solved the trash can ""mystery"" (I assumed it was aerosols)."
7294,I heard about it transmitting through aerosols before and that Covid aerosols can linger in the air for 20 minutes to a few hours.
7295,But I didn't realize they could float through a door and then through the air and through another door within 18 seconds.
7296,"You would think that the viral concentration in the air would be insanely low at that distance with the door only open for a few seconds, but I guess not."
7297,"&gt; I'm going on a limb here, but B1617 appears to be more transmissible; several clusters in the newest wave of infections in Singapore have been linked to the Delta variant (B16172), like the Changi Airport cluster (108 cases) and the Tan Tock Seng Hospital cluster (48 cases)."
7298,"Cases from one more, the JEM/Westgate shopping centre cluster (50 cases) have tested preliminarily positive for B1617."
7299,Damn.
7300,"I heard about the airport and that a relatively large number of fully vaccinated people got infected, but I didn't know there were other outbreaks/superspreader events associated with this virus in Singapore."
7301,"&gt; It's a bit concerning that several of the possible index cases were fully vaccinated;

Yeah, no kidding."
7302,"My understanding is that the MRNAs are around [75% effective against this variant, which is what the CEO of Pfizer said](https://globalnews.ca/news/7882376/biontech-covid-19-vaccine-india-variant/)."
7303,The data from those outbreaks seems to support that claim.
7304,&gt; the possible index case only visited one of the shopping centres - Westgate - on a single day (May 6) before testing positive the following day and subsequently being sent to the hospital.
7305,"Wait, does that mean they were hospitalized one day after contracting the virus?"
7306,That's insanely fast.
7307,"If your in the US, since demand is currently on the decline, I think it’s fair game for you to get vaccinated right now, regardless of if you have antibodies."
7308,Mine was done about 36 hours after the second shot.
7309,No it was not.
7310,"Some of the more fringe looney people may have been that way, but it had nothing to do with party."
7311,&gt;The population of Canada is about 3% that of India alone.
7312,There are developing countries much smaller than India.
7313,Peru for example has a population of 32.5 million.
7314,They've been hit really hard and they could use the vaccines sooner rather than later.
7315,Pointing to India is a terrible argument.
7316,The reality is Canada can make a big impact right now.
7317,Far more so than domestically.

7324,At least when I'm breaking down like that the 15 minute wait after seems to go by in seconds lol
7325,Absolutely!
7326,I’d like to see a side-by-side comparison.
7327,Would be useful when discussing with anti vaxxers.

7339,They are also falling down the q anon rabbit hole.
7340,It's been making me feel depressed.
7341,I'm the purple sheep in my family and I moved far away from them a long time ago.
7342,I want them to get vaxxed so I can see them again and so I can stop worrying about them.
7343,They are 64 so prime targets for covid and they love going to their mega church full of unmasked antivaxxers.
7344,The tests are not 100% accurate
7345,[removed]
7346,It's true.
7347,Some of my friends thought I was crazy for never going inside to even shop for groceries.
7348,Everything was delivered.
7349,I wasn't taking any chances with covid.
7350,A virus already fucked up my ear up big time.
7351,I didn't need covid to do another number on me.
7352,But now I've been to stores again.
7353,I'm not afraid.
7354,But I still wear a mask out of respect for others.
7355,I mean it seemed obvious that this wouldn’t happen while there is a lawsuit ongoing anyways.
7356,But at least they insisted it was not due to the quality but strictly because of the delivery issues.
7357,"Wait, he knew he had Covid or at least symptoms and came to work?"
7358,He should be fired for that.
7359,"That just shows he doesn't care about people (or serious issues), and if I were the boss that would be a redflag as an employer."
7360,"If peru is worse off than Mexico, Colombia &amp; Argentina are falling of a cliff at the moment"
7361,"When you compound the efficacy with the reduced transmission rates, with the reduced hospitalization rate, it is basically 100%."
7362,99.995% isn't technically 100% but it basically is.
7363,At this point the only people who are going to be getting severely sick from it are people who would have died from the flu or a common cold.

7365,"Of these cases, 11 are fully vaccinated:

7371,One finally got their first dose this week and another is waiting till a certain window.
7372,"So, at this point, she's unvaccinated and I am still running errands for her."
7373,I don't ask about personal medical information beyond what is offered.
7374,This is what they said and I know they were both eager to get it.

7378,My coworker and close friend has been advised not to get it until they figure out what autoimmune thing she’s got going on.
7379,"So she hopes to get it, but they don’t want to her to yet because it could cause some sort of flair up."
7380,Unfortunately she is nowhere near control as whatever is happening in her body flared up again last week.
7381,[deleted]
7382,The vaccines are paid for with federal money so they can’t be exported by the states.

7385,"https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4912

Do you have something more reliable and more recent?"
7386,"Fauci said:

&gt; ""If you're deficient in vitamin D, that does have an impact on your susceptibility to infection,” said Dr. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases."
7387,"“I would not mind recommending, and I do it myself, taking vitamin D supplements.”

Which is good *general* advice but says nothing specifically about COVID-19."
7388,"I've been tested, I had a Vitamin D deficiency like a lot of people over 50, and I've been supplementing for years."
7389,Vitamin D has been pushed specifically as a miracle preventative for COVID-19 based on poor evidence.
7390,"Many, many people on this sub are still arguing for masking in spite of the updated CDC guidance."
7391,No shit Sherlock
7392,"I don't believe for a second he was vaccinated, not because he caught it, just because of who he is."
7393,"I thought I would, but it's sort of a fake it 'til you make it scenario."
7394,"If you're vaccinated now, I would highly recommend taking small steps now to reintroduce yourself to things you enjoyed before."
7395,"As things ramp back up, you will have less of a chance to get back to normal at your own pace."
7396,There is a recent preprint finding that recovery from covid followed by 1 dose of Pfizer produces higher and more persistent antibody levels than 2 doses of Pfizer in someone who never had COVID.
7397,"See [Influence of past infection with SARS-CoV-2 on the response to the BioTech/ Pfizer BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine in health care workers: kinetics and durability of the humoral response](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.25.21257788v1)

&gt; We compared antibody responses to two doses of BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 vaccine between HCWs with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection before vaccination (experienced HCWs) and HCWs who were not previously infected (naive HCWs)."
7398,Results: Seven days after the first vaccine dose HCWs with previous infection experienced a 126 fold increase in antibody levels (GMC 26955 AU; 95% CI 18785-35125).
7399,"However, in the HCW naive group the response was much lower and only 5 of them showed positive antibody levels (&gt;50 AU)."
7400,The HCWs with previous infection did not significantly increased their antibody levels after the second dose while there was a significant increase in the naive HCW group (16 fold; GMC 20227 AU; 95% CI: 15179-25275).
7401,"Approximately two months after completing vaccination, the level of antibodies was much lower in naive HCWs (GMC 6595 AU vs. 25003 AU; p&lt;0.001)

Chances are good that the same is true for other vaccines."
7402,"As for boosters, right now nobody knows what will happen."
7403,Vaccine makers are testing various formulations and dosages so there are multiple options available if they turn out to be necessary.
7404,Testing a random sample of the population irrespective of symptoms.
7405,This would tell you about the true incidence of infection.
7406,Comedian 👍
7407,Enough suspicion though for Fauci and Biden to openly support an investigation.
7408,We just chose to vaccinate more with first dose instead to give more people some protection rather than 0.
7409,It was an excellent decision backed by science and results have been amazing.
7410,"Our youth vaccination rates are very good as well eventhough it just started

We also have higher risk groups like healthcare workers get fully vaccinated sooner."

7429,"I'm glad she got vaccinated, but she's an enigma."

7442,"
“After a single dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, people with a prior COVID-19 infection had antibody levels similar to those of people without prior infection after two vaccine doses."
7443,"The results, which need to be confirmed in large, diverse populations, may point to a strategy to stretch the currently limited supply of vaccines against COVID-19.” ([source](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/immune-response-vaccination-after-covid-19))

You can probably take comfort in knowing you’ve got substantial immunity after having covid and receiving one dose; however, you should receive your second dose."
7444,"You are not fully vaccinated at this point, and there isn’t enough data to determine how long and effective immunity would be if you only receive one dose in the series."
7445,Firstly because they can.
7446,It's the Americas after all.
7447,It's all nice and easy to have a Monroe doctrine but the US also has to take some responsibility.
7448,Secondly an out of control spread of the virus often leads to a new variant.
7449,Sooner or later a variant might pop up for which the existing vaccines don't work.
7450,Then that new variant will eventually spread to the US causing mayhem and death once again.
7451,And?
7452,"Cases, hospitalizations and death are plummeting like a rock thrown into a pond, because the strategy of getting out as many first doses as possible clearly worked."
7453,"Plus as provinces start shifting focus to second doses as of this week, we're gonna see the fully vaccinated number start to shoot up almost vertically on these graphs."

7523,"And many people don't trust the experts, especially after the constant shifting of expert opinions on various topics throughout this crisis."
7524,"I'm not saying that the vaccine hesitant are right, but the concerns are largely over if there are any long-term health effects so saying ""but 2 billion people got the shot within the past few months and aren't dead yet"" isn't really going to convince anyone."
7525,There was a time when medical experts also said cigarettes were perfectly healthy and after several decades people found out just how wrong the experts were.
7526,"And of course, who can forget the classic videos of kids in pools getting sprayed by DDT hoses because experts were convinced it was perfectly safe as well."

7538,That’s not true.
7539,"Around the same number of kids have died but that was with shutdowns, masking, etc."
7540,if we drop all precautions that will rise substantially.
7541,Plus there are unknown long term effects.
7542,It’s causing diabetes in kids that normally would not have.
7543,So 4/28 was your second shot?
7544,Yeah meanwhile it’s still quite difficult for vaccinated Europeans to get to the US.

7562,"It is not; And the entire mentioning of ""US citizens regardless of nationality"" is just meaningless."
7563,"US citizens have US nationality, period."
7564,They made it clear that all human beings who were able to come to Alaska (from anywhere in the world) can get vaccinated.
7565,"Obviously, not anyone can come (due to visa restrictions,  Covid making it especially hard to get a visa now, plus the overall cost of a journey)."
7566,"In fact, the same is for all other states too - nowhere in the vaccination appointment process, you would be specifying one's immigration status or citizenship."

7574,Things like the automotive chips that are causing line down at various car factories are built on older technologies.
7575,The manufacturing facilities for those were built and paid for by the cutting edge stuff when they were cutting edge and continue to be used for a long time for other things.

7582,We’ve had lulls before.
7583,We’re at about the same level of cases that we were last year around this time.
7584,Texas and Florida have pretty much always been mostly open.
7585,Key difference is vaccines now but we can’t just look at cases to say we are out of the pandemic.
7586,If I had to bet money i would say the worst is behind us but I don’t like giving Covid inch because we all know it takes a mile.
7587,"We got a bit more vaccine, but we still don't have enough for second doses."
7588,People have to wait months to get their second dose because we have relatively little supply.
7589,Great news
7590,"such people think they're soooo clever, when really they're treading the same tired groove others who share their dead-end ideology have trod for a thousand years."
7591,it's just exhausting.
7592,"Of course nothing is 100% effective, but why on earth are you coming after this person who clearly had good reason to be wearing a mask around irresponsible people?"
7593,"A vaccine is very effective, yes, but not 100%."
7594,"The same with a mask, which offers some level of protection, but not 100%."
7595,But combine them both together and you get something very close to 100% protection and can be out there working and enjoying a normal life while wearing a mask.
7596,"This person doesn't need to lock themselves away to achieve near 100% protection, all they have to do is make the personal choice to wear a mask in accordance with their risk tolerance."
7597,Enjoy not wearing your mask while vaccinated - not all of us are comfortable with that yet depending on the community of people we have to interact with when out in public.
7598,It doesn't affect you at all.

asymptomatic was actually a lot less than previously estimated

7602,"Italy also has a very high uptake so far, and I'd wager Germany and the Netherlands would reach 85% at the very least."
7603,Eastern Europe otoh is a bit of a shitshow.
7604,Multiple experts have stated that the biggest risk of adverse effects would be apparent within the first 6 weeks.
7605,The beauty of the logic here is we also don’t have a clue about the long term effects of COVID itself but people don’t seem too bothered by that one because all you seem to hear is “99.9% survival rate!

7613,"I just wanted to know if my long-term immunity could be different from someone who got both the doses once they recovered, and whether I'll be needing a booster."
7614,"I caught it a week after I got my first shot, for context."
7615,"Yes, this is fair - Seychelles is a bit more complicated."
7616,I haven't seen anything that breaks down AZ vs. Sinopharm effectiveness in Seychelles.
7617,AZ has higher headline efficiency but there is some evidence that is struggles a bit with variants (the stabilized spike protein of the mRNA and JnJ vaccines are probably helping there).
7618,This is extremely rare.

7644,"They don't actually change day to day; although, they have changed over time."

7651,"I had a woman come in the other day, the first thing she said to the front desk was about her needle phobia, so we took her to a private room for me to administer the vaccine, in a far more comfortable environment."

7653,Best of luck!
7654,They'll take good care of you!
7655,I think part of it is for the government to say they’ve literally done everything in their power to allow people to get vaccinated.
7656,"Now there’s free childcare, free Uber/Lyft rides, 24hr Friday vaccine clinics, and employer incentives for time off for vaccines."
7657,"Before lifting restrictions, you have to make sure there were no barriers that prevented certain groups from getting vaccinated."
7658,"And then at a certain point you say that anyone who hasn’t been vaccinated is because they didn’t want to, not because they couldn’t."
7659,Just look in the opposite direction and let them do their thing.
7660,You likely won't feel anything (but the sore arm a day or two later will happen).
7661,"The UK isn't just doing 12 week dose spacing for AZ, they're doing that for Pfizer too."
7662,Similar to Canada's up to 16 weeks (which is shrinking).
7663,Finland is also doing 12 week spacing for all vaccines.
7664,The fact that Pfizer and Moderna ran trials on short dose spacing has more to do with them wanting to finish the trials quickly than the general understanding of optimal vaccine dose spacing.
7665,"And Canada's first AZ doses were received in early March from the Serum Institute (technically CoviShield, but essentially rebranded AZ)."
7666,The US loaned doses were four weeks later followed by some from COVAX.
7667,"That said, having any vaccines approved in Canada before March 2021 was unexpected, hence the scramble to obtain more doses sooner than Q2 2021."

7686,Bunch of woke morons in this thread who are going to one day contribute to the destruction of civilized life.
7687,How?
7688,"I mean realistically, unless he's obese or old then there are overwhelming chances he''ll survive and reproduce."
7689,People with MS and every single type of cancer are explicitly encouraged to get vaccinated.
7690,"As we tell our patients, it is equally important that those around you are vaccinated because we don’t know the degree to which the vaccine confers immunity to you individually given your immune compromised status."
7691,Has no one been in a third world country?
7692,"The backwards parts are so full of tribalism, ignorance, superstition and extreme religious beliefs it’s unbelievable."
7693,From my understanding if youre vaccinated and you get it it's a lot more mild.
7694,"So, still worth."
7695,So basically what they discovered in their studies was a huge difference between the vaccinated and unvaccinated in terms of numbers of asymptomatic positive tests.
7696,Those vaccinated did not show positive tests nearly as much.
7697,It isn’t necessarily that a positive person can’t spread the disease (although viral loads would likely be much lower)...it’s that they just don’t carry the virus as much
7698,We've already spent 30 billion or something on vaccines.
7699,I wonder what it would cost?
7700,Probably not crazy amount more.
7701,You got a source for this?
7702,I did wonder this cos I've heard more people getting the 2nd dose at 8 weeks; would be nice to see the confirmation of it.

7711,Looking forward to putting an end to that and finding real friends for once.
7712,Not sure what you mean by quote.
7713,Our current mixed ICU (previously exclusively COVID+ patients) has an unsurprising demographic.
7714,This has been relatively true for weeks.
7715,It is interesting to hear patients nearing death or intubation talking to family on phones or iPads absolutely adamant that covid is real.
7716,Pretty surreal.
7717,I suppose reality just isnt convincing enough for people who have been so heavily propagandized
7718,Immunocompromised and cancer patient can take it.

7732,"But I don’t think it is helpful to seed alarmist or doomsday-type thoughts into the community.”

Bizarrely, the same guy that said all this [earlier last month](https://www.smh.com.au/national/top-epidemiologist-says-virus-outbreak-is-absolutely-inevitable-20210507-p57pth.html):

&gt;“The virus will win."
7733,"But it won’t have a devastating impact if we are vaccinated.”

&gt;“The strain is more transmissible and it is more severe, and the severity comes to lower age groups,” Professor McCaw said."
7734,"Can't quite reconcile that, myself."
7735,Doesn't Washington also have a large anti-vaxxer contingent?
7736,I seem to remember Washington having issues with measles outbreaks back in 2019 because of it.
7737,"Current projection is about [43 days to catch up with the US on overall doses](https://trevortombe.github.io/covidgraphs/Plots/pace_cdn_usa_projection_doses.png), but probably less than that since the US is slowing down."

7746,Oh hush with your logic and reason.
7747,Lol
7748,Yep.
7749,And it doesn't account for an asymptomatic cases people had because how would they even know?
7750,Even the estimated 90% sterilizing immunity was amoung healthcare workers for the CDC study.
7751,Older and immune comprised people were always going to end up lowering the levels in the world.

8201,I currently work in medical diagnostics and was a personal trainer and easily most people healthy or not have slight or severe vitamin D deficiency.
8202,"It's wise to take vitamin D. But, it's also wise to get labs done regularly to monitor your intake of vit D, calcium, B12, etc."
8203,TBH IMO we have a bigger issue with diabetes than vit and mineral deficiency.
8204,That's mostly pharma propaganda they spread around in the media to protect their interests.
8205,"Moderna themselves advertises on their website that they're easier to make then traditional vaccines:

https://www.modernatx.com/pipeline/therapeutic-areas/mrna-therapeutic-areas-infectious-diseases

Of course we would also need to also be engaging in technology sharing and other initiatives, but we should absolutely be doing that anyway."
8206,All of this stuff was made with public research and letting millions suffer and die to protect pharma profits is monstrous on its face.
8207,"Not long ago, even trying to profit off vaccines was consider verboten in the medical community:

https://newrepublic.com/article/162527/long-strange-trips-grubby-history-vaccines-became-intellectual-property


In strictly pragmatic terms, it would also be about the biggest soft power win for the United States if we helped vaccinate everyone, like, actually saving the world versus our post WWII history of obliterating small countries for no obvious reason or gain."
8208,It doesn’t negate the fact a large percentage of asshats in the US need something to make them get the shot.
8209,Really?
8210,You need money/beer/concert tickets bribes etc… to get a free life saving shot that also benefits society?
8211,"""Come to Brazil"""
8212,We already have.
8213,Adults who got vaccinated want their lives back and those who are not vaccinated likely fall into the camp of having never cared to begin with (and are partly responsible for this pandemic lasting as long as it has).
8214,"I fully recognize that when you factor in unvaccinated adults and kids into potential COVID exposure scenarios you could have an outcome where cases spike higher than we've had to date (and is worth recognizing this possibility), but so far real-life data is not syncing up to that... yet."
8215,Do we keep things shut down over what-if possibilities or follow what is actually happening in real-time?
8216,It sounds more like an issue of needing to cross that bridge if/when we get there more than anything.
8217,"If cases start to spike in children, I'd hope we're at a point where we could do contact tracing and localized shutdowns of schools and other places where kids congregate in large volumes."
8218,"If cases spike in the remaining unvaccinated adults, we should ask them why in the hell they haven't listened to science, logic, or reason for any time in the last year+."
8219,Definitely a welcome move in sharp contrast to the previous administration.
8220,"Obviously if a variant is allowed to develop in 1 country, all other countries are at risk too."
8221,But yeah I think the COVID threat will be eradicated once for all only once they will develop a Pan coronavirus vaccine.

8704,You might remember that he ran on a platform that vaccines were causing autism back in 2016 and even got into it in a debate with Ben Carson (a freaking pediatric surgeon) who called out his bs.
8705,None of the other candidates were on the vaccines-cause-autism bandwagon.
8706,Then Trump won and suddenly Republicans started changing their minds on everything.
8707,"Suddenly Russia was cool, after always hating them."
8708,Suddenly free trade was bad and tariffs were good.
8709,Suddenly vaccines were bad (which is still weird because Trump's admin funded getting them mass produced while testing was ongoing (operation warp speed) and Trump himself got vaccinated early on).
8710,"As someone who is right-leaning but more of a moderate conservative, it has been extremely frustrating watching Trump completely destroy the Republican party."

9088,Chile is surging despite high vaccination rates with Coronavac.
9089,It's still *way* better than the alternative.
9090,"Death rates are significantly down, and the surges are nowhere near as bad as they would have been without vaccines."
9091,"That said, one of the reasons why they are facing surges is because the vaccines have triggered return to normalcy."

9138,"Also it's not like ""vaccinated people can't spread COVID"" just that the chance of it isn't high enough to warrant wearing a mask."
9139,"It's not always a matter of possibility but likelihood in a population, lifting other restrictions will be similar."

9159,Really?
9160,Whats with all the backlog?
9161,"Bahrain and Israel have similar vaccination rates

While in Israel covid cases are almost non-existant, Bahrain never managed to get their cases down and is seeing new surge of cases

This raises question how effective Sinopharm actually is"
9162,It's for non-Americans.
9163,"Heck, they may even take a vaccine-vacation to Bakersfield."
9164,Do not spread misinformation.
9165,"&gt; I'm not even so worried about hospital at this point but of long covid

I have yet to see anything about this."
9166,I'd really like to know how well the vaccines prevent it.
9167,"I'd guess that they help quite a bit and might even prevent it, but it's impossible to say for sure when we aren't even sure what the causes of long covid are."
9168,The part that worries me most is that the long-haul symptoms can show up in people with mild infections.
9169,"i mean, sure, your area might be doing fine, but that doesnt mean others are."
9170,"like you, im in an area where COVIDs under control, but im not going to pretend the whole world is like that for it."
9171,"yes, theres also nothing i can do for it, like India for example, but im aware of whats going on."
9172,i would hope you would want the rest of the whole to recover soon.
9173,"The odds of an unvaccinated kid spreading the virus around their home, especially if their parents aren't vaccinated is much higher."

9175,"Nope an acquaintance of mine had his son write his family all letters saying everyone worked for his medical supply company, therefore they were ""essential workers"" even though this dude was retired and in his 70s along with his wife and kids."

9189,"Theres a good chance that the lions share were people who were exposed prior to their 2nd vaccine, or even possibly their first one."

9191,"Still pretty low, but that is not insignificant, considering there are people who have died after being reinfected."
9192,"I understand it's not something to be super alarmed about, but if we don't take it seriously there are people out there who may die via reinfection which is pretty damn serious."
9193,Everyone should get vaccinated to be safe.

9206,&gt;so.
9207,"I understand we can’t let out guard down, but it’s annoying that many countries won’t let vaccinated people travel, even when they are getting tested and contact tracing."
9208,The UK requires a ten day quarantine and $1000 for testing out of your own pocket.
9209,"There needs to be clearer messaging and more 

My trip to the US this week:

Outbound: £45 rapid

Inbound: £45 rapid

Day 5 quick release: £115 PCR"
9210,That’s just false and it’s been shown to be false repeatedly.
9211,This study shows children will now bear the risk of society opening without vaccination.

9213,My parents still live in my rural hometown and it's a shitshow.
9214,Thankfully both of my parents are vaxxed.
9215,I live on the much-more populated West side of the state and my county is *almost* at 70%.
9216,No shit
9217,"Yeah, that just logically makes sense."
9218,"&gt;Our results demonstrate that relaxing social distancing measures for vaccinated individuals would have minimal impact on incidence, but extending such guidelines to other individuals before adequate vaccination of children could fuel a rapid rise in COVID-19 cases, hospitalisations, and deaths.4 Furthermore, mounting incidence makes the emergence of additional variants of concern more likely, potentially compromising the efficacy of vaccines.5 These findings have important policy implications for the control of the pandemic."
9219,"Given that most children might not be vaccinated until 2022, it is unlikely that the coverage of fully vaccinated individuals aged 12 years and older would confer sufficient herd immunity by July 4."
9220,"To bank the benefits of vaccination, avert additional pandemic waves, and facilitate a sustainable resumption of social and economic activities, we urge a cautious approach to updating COVID-19 guidelines in the coming months, especially given the emergence of highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants.6 Our study underscores the risks of prematurely lifting measures, which will be borne disproportionately by individuals who are not yet vaccinated."
9221,"That airline is never flying to mainland china again lol  

what a costly mistake"
9222,Biden and Fauci are using lab leak hypothesis for political gain and for advantage over China.
9223,It’s not based on science.
9224,"I wish I had a reasonable answer to give you with regards to the travel ban, but I don't."
9225,"There is no news on the US lifting it any time soon, and it is bizarre given some of the countries they still allow direct travel from whilst banning countries which are vaccinating en masse."
9226,"The next current 'beacon' for hope is Biden attending the G7 shortly, but it's doubtful that any news will come from it."
9227,"This is absolutely untrue

There are three lung diseases that have been told cannot have these vaccines for example."
9228,A person's individual doctor will tell them if they can't have the vaccine but there are some people who cannot have it.
9229,If you look at the CDC guidance it says it is safe for *most* people.
9230,As always that small amount is relying on us to keep them safe.
9231,"""Literally?"""
9232,"""Ignorance in science, eh?"""
9233,Good one.
9234,You have 0 reason to believe that except your own lack of knowledge in the current epidemiology.
9235,The mere fact that he are already thinking booster shots means there is an ongoing threat.
9236,"I am not 100% that there right be one, but if there is, remember this post."
9237,Only a fool would call victory this soon.
9238,"Lastly, nothing inyour post changes what K sakd regarding Fauci."
9239,He did say those things.
9240,Very cool thank you!
9241,I wanted to thank everyone for answering my questions and relaying their experiences with the vaccine.
9242,I got my first jab yesterday and I feel fine (kinda sore arm tho lol).
9243,yeah but if I’m reading the stats correctly there’s like less than 1% chance of reinfection happening… not even worth talking about at that point.
9244,Of which only 1 in 20 had to seek help which means it is a 1 in 60000 problem (in a very specific group) that even then is pretty easily resolved.
9245,But antivaxxers will galore as they did with the AZ problems.
9246,[removed]
9247,"The thing is though, the cleaning didn't really make any difference to whether they got Covid or not."
9248,"my mother had spinal surgery right before her second vaccine was scheduled, the doc didnt have any huge reasons to wait other than comfort, so she waited an extra week and we got our second shots together."
9249,"All schools, public and private, should require students to be vaccinated prior to starting classes."
9250,"The students who have medical complications and cannot would be exempt, but that is it."
9251,"No free passes for not caring about others, not if you want to be in spaces with 20+ other people."
9252,I'm so sorry that that happened to your cousin.
9253,"Disability is a term used most often to refer to very drastic conditions - blindness, deafness, paralysis - but which does also apply to any condition or difference someone may have from ""the norm"" which puts them in a place where, without adequate accommodations, they could not carry out or complete tasks others are able to do unassisted."
9254,"It does cover a rather broad spectrum of things, including pregnancy, neurodivergence (autism, ADHD, DID), ALS, and tons more."
9255,We are often the most forgotten about community.
9256,"Again, that's not downplaying mask effectiveness."
9257,It's downplaying mask protectiveness.
9258,Or really just accurately describing the protectiveness.
9259,"You: hospitalisations are rising

Me: and that's completely normal

You: feeling personally attacked that someone added to your comment."
9260,Yeah because otherwise antimaskers could just lie about being vaccinated
9261,"Well, AZ was the first case where a potentially deadly outcome, for how unlikely it may be, has been casually connected to the vaccine."
9262,"Also AZ did some missteps in the early stages (you'll remember the half dose blunder in Brazil, and they also apparently were reluctant in producing data to the regulatory authorities) resulting in the vaccine not being approved by the FDA in the US."
9263,One of these is actually practical.
9264,It really just stems down to Americans not liking it when people tell them what to do.
9265,As if wearing a mask is a huge inconvenience.
9266,It should be a courtesy to your fellow humans but instead it's treated as a symbol of oppression.

9273,Where is King County?
9274,The Headless Horseman who was apparently Christopher Walken!
9275,Why?
9276,Children aren’t at risk for covid.
9277,Other illness and activities (swimming m) are way more dangerous.
9278,I mean do you know of any kids personally who have had a bad case of covid or died from it?
9279,Noting has changed since the cruise ship events early on in 2020.
9280,This is an illness that affects old people.
9281,Kids typically have coronavirus as it’s a normal part of childhood.
9282,trust me it's not that safer.
9283,Going back to normal is more than masks and gatherings though.
9284,Here in Hungary they lowered the waiting to 4-6 weeks.
9285,I got my first jab on May 7th and the will get the second on June 18th.
9286,But I still don't understand why so many countries started to reject AZ...
9287,I've heard plenty of rumors about Pfizer too... news came out of Israel that it can cause hearth inflammation and from other sources I've heard that it can make young women infertile.
9288,But still no restrictions on Pfizer
9289,How badly do you really need attention?
9290,Honest question.
9291,"You clearly want people to pay you some



Also literally nobody cares that you dont want to be vaccinated"
9292,Then where are the sick and dying kids in Texas and Florida?
9293,Those states have been open for months.
9294,You sound like a conspiracy theorist.
9295,Huh.... weird
9296,What if there was a focused protection plan?
9297,"I hope we will be more sensible, I just worry about ending up like the US where vaccination numbers have crashed and they're doing every gimmick they can think of to desperately get more people to be vaccinated."
9298,"And that's a place that has lost over half a million people, while in NZ we've lost 26 and nearly all were elderly people with dementia in two nursing homes."
9299,Our most hesitant population is our Maori population and they're also by far the most at risk from an outbreak.
9300,"The TV ads for vaccination right now almost exclusively target Maori as a result, but no telling how successful they'll be."
9301,I have been hearing a lot of anecdotal stories about middle class professional people who aren't typical anti-vaxxers saying they won't ever get this vaccine though.
9302,Life here is so normal it's very easy to totally forget there's a pandemic going on beyond the borders.
9303,That breeds huge complacency but I'd rather we not have to have an outbreak to change that.
9304,"Yeah, there should have been way more police enforcement."
9305,How do we expect people to stay home if it's not enforced?
9306,There should have been cops roaming the street ready to ticket people outside their homes.
9307,Anything less is not a true lockdown.
9308,this will not end well
9309,This is my only concern right now.
9310,Everyone in my house is vaccinated except my 2 year old.
9311,"If she catches the virus, I don't expect her to die from it."
9312,What worries me are the stories of people still experiencing smell /taste / neurological issues months after recovering.
9313,The long term side effects are not something to ignore.
9314,No one is acting like we eradicated this virus because most adults have already come to the realization that eradication isn't possible.
9315,Most people just acknowledge that this is likely to be as good as it gets.
9316,(In the US) Vaccines are widely available and you can walk in practically anywhere and get one.
9317,There's no point in worrying preemptively about variants.
9318,"So far, the vaccines have shown effective against every one of them."
9319,There might come a day when that's no longer true but it's not true today so I'm living my life pretty much as I did pre covid.
9320,Of course the alternative is to keep living as if you're unvaccinated and keep waiting for the variant that the current vaccines won't protect against.
9321,What about a focused protection plan?
9322,Only 1 in 3 experienced quarantine and isolation?
9323,You will.
9324,TPB and Letterkenny.
9325,Now to ask.
9326,Are you in Oregon or Washington?
9327,"My life sucked the last year because lockdowns prevented me from going to graduate school, do I need to reassess my priorities too?"
9328,The nerve of some of these comments....
9329,Maybe if you read the paper you would understand why it's important
9330,Oh no!

9332,Anyways….
9333,"... ... You argue against seatbelts and speed limits, don't you, because some people do die in crashes at 5mph."

9497,Starting to become apparent that many places have not been testing for varients at all.
9498,Makes you wonder if part of the reason positivity rates are declining is simply because the varients we aren't testing for are becoming dominant.
9499,"FDA told us in January the old tests will give false negatives for varients, and here we are in June and many regions have still not updated their testing."
9500,I thought Sinopharm's real world data shows it works as you can see the data from country like Serbia where 70% used Sinopharm.

9506,That's untrue.

9509,Suriname has extremely remote villages where such thing would come into play.
9510,"Also, The minister wouldn't have made this decision in an ICU maximum capacity scenario."
9511,"Suriname is currently having to turn down patients from the hospital, so they would welcome basically any vaccine right now."
9512,the logic aplied to the variant efficacy doesn't work like that.
9513,"pfizer and sinovac aren't made in the same way, and because the sinovac vaccine uses the inactivated virus, it is efficient against all variants."
9514,brazil tests have made this clear.
9515,"the chile problem is that, as you said, you have to have the 2 doses of the sinovac vaccine for it to be effective, and people in chile are already going out after it."

9552,Why so negative?
9553,"Things will go back to normal in the end, might take some time but it will."
9554,"Covid will always stay, just like the other viruses."

Finally, elder people had a higher need for a vaccine."
9709,That does not mean that children don't need vaccines.

9737,"I fail to see how making a testing kit would be so easy for a ""country that has no clean water"" yet making a vaccine after it has already been done is the impossible task."
9738,"I know that both companies were working this way, I've been trying to keep myself informed, but information always changes."
9739,I still dont understand why everyone thinks I'm off-base by saying the US could have done better?
9740,"We all know we screwed up domestically, but we dont consider that we also screwed up abroad as well?"
9741,I hate the government and i still got the vaccine

9745,"Their common response is ""yea guess I should have gotten it"""

9747,And that has what to do with getting vaccinated with something that has been rigorously tested and shown to be highly effective at preventing serious disease and death while incredibly safe - with hundreds of millions of doses now delivered.
9748,surprised because one of the early reasons given for Japan's low infection rates was due to them vaccinating against TB.
9749,And randomly tested for things like sports and travel.
9750,So we should be picking up a lot of asymptomatic infections.

9756,"If 80% of the elderly are vaccinated and more naturally immune, it's just not going to be that much of a problem since others around them are vaccinated."
9757,So I understand and completely agree.
9758,I am fully vaccinated but there is that small chance and my brain sometimes goes...”but what if there is an adverse impact years down the road and the entire world got the shot?”  Like I don’t actively point out these apprehensions to other people to scare them because I want everyone vaccinated but man that like .01% chance is magnified just because so many people are getting these shots.

9771,Covid is in absolute shambles.
9772,After being in very high risk (red) or extreme high risk (purple) for over a year the entire state of NJ is just high risk (Orange) and one county is moderate risk (yellow).
9773,It seems very soon the entire state of NJ will be in modedate risk for the first time in a year plus.
9774,Will be interesting to see how quickly people drop masks.
9775,I can tell you in the shopping trips I’ve taken so far I’ve only seen probably about 4 or 5 other people not wearing masks.
9776,Doesn’t really bother me all that much but just find it interesting.
9777,"Good details by age
Vaccination rates still increasing at 65+ and 75+ which is good"

9782,The very high likelihood is that they are protected and there are now studies indicating mothers can pass antibodies to unborn children.
9783,So I think they are set aside from their fear of vaccination.

9789,Could anyone possibly point me to the official guidelines for New York indoor gatherings?
9790,My indoor wedding venue is telling me that we’re only allowed to seat 10 at a table instead of 12 per NYS guidelines and also that we mandatorily have to prove negative tests and vaccinations even if we’re under 250.
9791,I can’t find anything online saying either of these.
9792,Thanks!!
9793,:)
9794,Is there any reason to choose pfizer over moderna or vice versa?
9795,Geographic distribution contracts are simple.
9796,BioNTech owns the vaccine.
9797,"Pfizer and Fosun are both investors in BioNTech, each paying hundreds of millions to billions to BioNTech."
9798,"In exchange Pfizer is the contract manufacturer and distributor for US and EU while Fosun is the contract manufacturer (though it's not running yet) and distributor for China, HK and Taiwan."
9799,They keep a portion of the money from all sales.
9800,Fosun paid it's own money for this contract.
9801,Now Taiwan wants to take this away from them with no compensation.
9802,There is one way Taiwan gets the vaccines.
9803,Taiwan can work something out where BioNTech ships them the vaccines directly but they pay Fosun full price along with a contract violation fee.
9804,Anything else would be a theft from Fosun.

Due to shortages the local government is recommending mix'n'matching vaccines for your 2nd dose and I wanted to know what the deal is with that"

9819,I will say that there was an article posted by the Independent today saying that hospitalisations are still low.
9820,In one of the hardest hit areas of the UK there were 3 people submitted to hospital in the past 24 hours whilst 8 people were discharged.
9821,"There's also the fact that infection rates for the older groups (the group that is vaccinated) was only around 5 in every 100,000."
9822,"Naturally time will tell if this changes, but right now i'd say don't drop into despair just yet."
9823,He’s way too opinionated to lie about that kinda thing.

9825,That doesn’t mean it’s not irresponsible to do so.

9852,"Oh man, feels like yesterday."
9853,This virus has been kicking our ass for so long!
9854,We are in a global pandemic.
9855,countries should worked together and funded covax rather than doing personal bilateral deals with manufacturers to get ahead in line.
9856,I'm upset that vaccines could have been provided to places that needed them the most rather than wealthier countries.
9857,It's just beneficial to everyone in the long run.
9858,"Vox did a pretty okay segment about it..

9859,"that's the official statement, I'm asking you if you know the reasoning behind it"
9860,I'm sorry this is happening.
9861,Texas has barred schools from requiring masks.
9862,"Since the under 12 set can't get vaccinated, I don't understand the thinking."
9863,There are differences.
9864,I can see why someone would prefer to only get one vaccine to be able to unmask and travel.
9865,I can also see why someone would prefer an mRNA vaccine for greater effectiveness.
9866,I know this is something to do with the AZ debacle but honestly Australia is lagging behind vaccines a bit and now we’re seeing previously unaffected nations like Taiwan and Vietnam having huge infection spikes so then getting extra vaccines from the U.K. now won’t be too bad.
9867,The vaccine roll out made me happy to be an American.
9868,In most states it proceeded quite smoothly.
9869,The playing field has now been leveled.
9870,"We've all had a year to become really weird and awkward; to chase those strange dreams of slowing down, learning to dance, and finding ourselves."

9873,Happened in Israel and there was a brief spike here in the US
9874,[removed]
9875,Israel will struggle to get much higher.
9876,They have a large population of ultra-orthodox Jews that are quite vaccine hesitant.
9877,"But at least we can see that even with 63% vaccination case rates have plummeted and they can open back up, more or less."
9878,it was enough for Chilean regulators.
9879,"While we can never count the virus out, we're seeing positive seasonal effects combined with the fact that 12+ population are at a minimum of about 75% seropositive (first doses + infections assuming a 4X undercount)."
9880,There's just not a lot of hosts left for the virus to go.
9881,"The other factor is that where vaccination rates are low, testing is also low."
9882,"5 out of the 7 least vaccinated states - Mississippi, Alabama, Wyoming, Idaho, Arkansas - all have positivity rates above 5% (not terrible, but certainly not great)."
9883,Idaho and Alabama are about 10% (flashing red positivity rates).
9884,Higher positivity rates mean significantly greater case undercounts.
9885,Those states appear pretty good by recent per capita cases but only because they are not testing.

10120,Better to do both
10121,"Israel has 5% better rate of first doses, and 20% better rate of second doses."

10144,2 to 2.9% of the remaining 3% is simply people that didn't disclose whether they were vaccinated  or human/administration errors in tracking.
