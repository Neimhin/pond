0,Many on this forum seem to be of the opinion that the vaccine's effectiveness in preventing infection is minimal.
1,"However, if that were true, wouldn't we be seeing many many more infections?"
2,"Considering everything is pretty much open, with few restrictions, and that while the numbers are high and have been high for this wave, it hasn't surpassed the peak of the previous wave (or was it two waves ago?)"
3,at it's worst (correct me if I'm wrong)... and you would think it would given how much more transmittable delta is.
4,"So yeah, I guess I'm just trying to make a judgment on the vaccines effectiveness based on an extremely general judgement about the situation in the US as a whole, and was wondering if anyone thought it was a reasonable take to say that the vaccines actually work fairly well in preventing any infection at all."
5,"Edit: I should add, I am not on here too often so perhaps there isn't very much of what I felt I was seeing a bit ago of people's opinions that the vaccine isn't so effective at preventing transmission."
6,Apologies if that is the case and I've mischaracterized some users.

11,"No...again, I will say I do not think colorado is seeing an increase in covid cases because of low vaccination rates, if that were the case we likely would have seen much higher rates the rest of covid."
12,I'm sure vaccines effectiveness have been a large part and I think the fact that we never had much of a delta surge to begin with are likely the reason as well as people getting more back to normal since we did have low case numbers and high vaccinations.

23,"I was always saying ""real research means looking at stuff that goes against your gut instinct"" in online arguments."

25,I recognized my own hypocrisy and took another look.
26,Lo and behold there was a lot of info that went against my gut instinct and it actually changed my mind.

1487,My 2 girls 7 &amp; 9 just got their shots yest.
1488,Shots # 9 &amp; 10 in out county
1489,Any Doctor in general should promote vaccines because they know what the vaccine does.
1490,"If they're advocating they shouldn't get a vaccine they've chosen the wrong field of profession and most likely just doing it because of ""Money."""
1491,Oh nvm i totally misread lol.
1492,"Hopefully, unless there‚Äôs a legitimate medical need/life threatening allergy to the compounds in the shot, not getting your kid the shot will be something we can lump into the ‚Äúdelinquent parent‚Äù/abuse category and actually go after the parents until they vaccinate their kids."
1493,Yay!
1494,Glad you got an appointment!
1495,Good.
1496,[removed]
1497,I know right.
1498,Funny enough from those words me and wife kinda got into it.
1499,I told her how do we trust this Dr. on other things if we think differently on this shot than she does.
1500,"Wife was like she is a great Dr. and has been, we will just get the shot another place."
1501,"Let's have a look for Canada:

Estimated $23,000 average hospital cost pre-Delta (probably higher with Delta)

5.18% of cases are hospitalized."
1502,"Treatment is $700

Treatment is 90% effective."
1503,So that's a reduction to 0.518% hospitalizations for giving $700 treatment to 100% of people.
1504,"For 1000 cases:

(5.18/100) * 1000 * 23,000 = $1,191,400

vs.

((0.518/100) * 1000 * 23,000) + (700 * 1000) = $819,140

So, universal use of this would result in an immediate reduction of 31.25% the cost, plus long-term savings through not having to pay for life-long heart problems, people becoming diabetic from COVID, reduced labour productivity, long-term disability costs,  reduced burdens on social supports for situations where a 35-year-old died and left young kids behind, etc."
1505,The largest risk is the risk of emergent stuff from people not being concerned about catching/spreading COVID e.g.
1506,"immune escape, emergent conditions from CNS damage, etc."

1509,"Everyone does, because almost no countries are vaccinating under-12s."
1510,And almost every country has anti-vax pockets.
1511,The homogeneity of vaccination is crucially important; if you have 80% vaccinated but the remaining 20% only group withe each other then Delta will spread among those 20% just as quickly as if you hadn't vaccinated anyone.
1512,"Only infection can close that gap, and places that have had large waves in the past often have them filled."
1513,This is why Singapore with 80-85% double-vaccination still had rising cases.
1514,"In Israel, 71% of the population has had a first dose, 45% have had three doses, and 14% of the population has tested positive."
1515,"Around 1/4 of the population is under 12, and still ineligible."
1516,I believe they have fairly strong vaccine requirements; there are not millions of eligible people unvaccinated.
1517,The german hive-mind is always to be trusted
1518,Got it.
1519,Time to stop worrying about the anti-vax health.

1819,*
1820,It is baffling to me.
1821,[19% of the US population is unvaccinated but wearing masks as precaution against COVID-19](https://news.northeastern.edu/2021/10/15/unvaccinated-population-wearing-masks/).
1822,Statements implying that masks are anywhere close to the effectiveness of vaccines are irresponsible.
1823,The scientists themselves aren't getting the tens of millions in their pocket the CxOs and major shareholders are.
1824,Especially the large number of supporting scientific roles.
1825,"And definitely not the assistants supporting research roles by running and maintaining equipment, making sure supplies are stocked and available."
1826,Far more money is spent on marketing than is spent on R&amp;D at pharma companies.
1827,There's far better models of funding these things.
1828,Because the researchers actually making the breakthroughs are perfectly fine with their 6 figure salaries.
1829,We're not going to have any shortage of scientists because CEOs and corporate stock portfolios aren't making billions.
1830,"Academia already does the bulk of basic research, which then gets licensed to big pharma companies."
1831,It's long past time we moved to alternative funding models.
1832,"And don't forget, it's not like there's no drug development coming out of countries where they don't let drug companies go insane with the exploitation."
1833,Giving more money to better models would produce better results.
1834,*Especially* for drugs for less common conditions that aren't as profitable.
1835,You know how much money is pissed away making yet another drug with absolutely no improvement over others that it works the same exact way for the same conditions because they're so common they can make a killing?
1836,"And how little research money they put back into treatments for things that might not be profitable to treat, especially if they (god forbid) develop a cure rather than a treatment?"

1846,You are certainly ignorant and have no experience with spinal injury or lifting.
1847,Probably a neckbeard.
1848,You've been eligible to be vaccinated for how many months now?
1849,"As someone who also lives in LA, every pharmacy and grocery store has had walk ins for months."
1850,I'm sure the reason why it has suddenly become a little difficult is bc boosters and children can now be vaccinated so slots are now filling up.
1851,Don't worry it probably won't be like this for long.
1852,You having trouble now is entirely on you though.
1853,"But the data shows even being fully vaccinated, you still transmit covid."
1854,"So the argument the vax is to protect those around you, doesn't hold water anymore(as Israel is experiencing)"
1855,I mean I think this can all fall under the same idea of forming beliefs rationally.
1856,"Part of the equation is that, the more consequential a belief is, the more rigorously you must confirm it when forming that belief."
1857,"If you told me you were wearing a red sweater, I would believe it no questions because it's inconsequential."
1858,"If you told me the apocalypse is coming and everyone that doesn't sacrifice their first born son in the name of god is going to be sentenced to an eternity of hell... well, it would be morally wrong for me to believe this without some unfathomably strong evidence"
1859,I agree.
1860,"Why is the CDC promoting masks over vaccines, when the latter is exponentially more protective than the former?"
1861,I‚Äôm confounded.

1871,"Counterpoint: varicella vaccines are required for [school](https://www.immunize.org/laws/varicella.asp), and chicken pox is mild for kids."
1872,"But like covid, it‚Äôs highly contagious and can be serious for other groups (eg, pregnant women)."
1873,"Also, covid has long term effects in around 11-15% of kids."
1874,"Fatigue, brain fog, and learning difficulties."
1875,We have no idea how long these symptoms can last.
1876,Only about 100 people die of chicken pox every year and yet we vaccinate for that.
1877,I've had shingles (as a result of having chicken pox) - I sure as hell would have rather had a vaccine when I was a kid.
1878,"You know that 80% of eligible folks in the Us have at least one shot, right?"
1879,It‚Äôs required in Massachusetts
1880,&gt;WTF is going on?

1882,It is almost always wrong.

1890,"I more or less agree with what you‚Äôre saying, but I don‚Äôt think anyone was trying to hide anything."
1891,The info is all out there for anyone with two brain cells to rub together to go over and read.

1900,Smallpox?

1902,People accepted that people smarter than them had figured out how to protect them.
1903,"Didn't help they said masks don't work (because the didn't have enough supply for first line and wanted to stop everyone taking the supply, but said it was scientific reasons) then eventually said you need to wear a mask."
1904,"That flip flopping made people not believe it, rather that saying the truth ""we didn't prepare and don't have enough, so stay home and don't stock up on all the masks"" (same in UK and US)

In Spain they handed out mask here to every house within the first few weeks of the start!"

1918,"&gt;The saddest part is, that one massive RCT study from Bangladesh actually showed that masking actually reduces COVID spread‚Ä¶ 

That study's findings were way more nuanced than they presented it themselves in the public press or how it was reported."
1919,"They could not find a statistically significant decrease in SARS-CoV-2 infections due in the treatment group with cloth masks, only with surgical masks and this was only apparent in the 50+ age groups."
1920,[See page 30 of their report](https://www.poverty-action.org/sites/default/files/publications/Mask_RCT____Symptomatic_Seropositivity_083121.pdf).
1921,"&gt;We found clear evidence that surgical masks are effective in reducing symptomatic seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2; while cloth masks clearly reduce symptoms, we **cannot reject that they have zero or only a small impact on symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections (perhaps reducing symptoms of other respiratory diseases)."
1922,"**  


Masks obviously are useful when there isn't any vaccine and any decrease is a good, but the CDC and other groups acting like they are as good as vaccines is crazy."
1923,"We got a live one, folks."
1924,You are exactly the kind of person I was talking about.
1925,I honestly feel bad for you.
1926,"Yes, I think that's fair, except that it's entirely possible that a new variant pops up six months from now that is more adept at evading natural immunity than vaccine immunity."
1927,The reverse is not true.
1928,There is no scenario scenario where taking the vaccine will lead to a worse immune response in the future.
1929,"Natural immunity is of course more diffuse, and less likely to be impacted by a single mutation, but nevertheless, vaccination can only help."
1930,[removed]
1931,It will be brigaded with misinformation by antivaxxers
1932,It may not be relevant to their interest though.
1933,The field of medicine is absurdly broad.
1934,"You and other Redditors are the ones making speculations, I have not speculated that he died of a heart attack or overdose."
1935,I have stated on multiple occasions that I don‚Äôt know how he died.
1936,Now you are simply being dishonest.
1937,"So let's play the devils advocate here,

In lieu of Israel, being the highest vaxxed nation(80% of 12yr of above) in the world, having a surge in covid cases after they re-opened, it's clear that the vax will not stop the spread as much as people seem to believe(I'm not sure what this means for the possibility of achieving herd-immunity)

The CDC data shows the covid risks of intended target audience is already extremely low(I'm also looking at this, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7260492/), and as OP article suggests, the transmissibility of covid among kids appears lower than some of the other vax-mandated diseases

So then one begs the question, what would a mandate achieve that Israel did not despite, such a high vax status?"
1938,[removed]
1939,You‚Äôre referring to a vaccine in pill-form.
1940,That‚Äôs not what this is.
1941,"It‚Äôs an antiviral that needs to be administered within 3-5 days of CATCHING covid, something you are unlikely to experience at all if vaccinated."
1942,[removed]
1943,The kids are around people who can't be vaccinated.
1944,"If they catch it, even if THEY don't die, the other person will."
1945,Herd immunity doesn't work if a massive subset of the population isn't protected.
1946,"The more people protected, the slower the spread."
1947,We will not stamp out COVID without mass immunity/resistance.
1948,"Furthermore, allowing the disease to spread contributes to further mutations, meaning more problems for even vaccinated people."
1949,[removed]
1950,Lol he took his beliefs to the grave.
1951,There's a titers test you can take that can tell you what you have or no longer have immunity to.
1952,Or‚Ä¶ Darwin‚Äôs Law
1953,"These pills are good for everyone.At risk people with comorbidities and breakthrough infections, people who cant get a vaccine, vaccinated people who need to go to the hospital and now will hopefully be able to find beds...its even good for the few holdouts who dont want to get vaccinated."
1954,If this keeps them from getting sick and taking up hospital beds I'm all for it.
1955,We're in a rural area.
1956,"I found an appointment for my 9 year old 30 minutes away, but it was cancelled due to supply issues."
1957,My husband was able to find another appointment an hour away.
1958,We were able to get her first shot and boosters for ourselves.
1959,It was well worth the drive!
1960,Now to get us all flu shots and the shingles vaccine for me!
1961,Oh I‚Äôm all aware that Cove it is never going to disappear.
1962,Then again practically no viruses have disappeared but we don‚Äôt even think about most of them because of high vaccination rates.
1963,"And if you think that what we have going now is sustainable to our healthcare infrastructure, you‚Äôre going to be in for a surprise in the coming weeks months and years"
1964,[removed]
1965,"sure, but it‚Äôs still the first time mrna is being used widely."
1966,to say there‚Äôs ‚Äúnothing new‚Äù is disingenuous.
1967,Just like when health experts were saying initially that ‚Äúget the covid vaccine so you won‚Äôt get covid‚Äù was disingenuous.
1968,"They should have just been up front and said, ‚Äúthe vaccine will greatly decrease your chances of serious symptoms, but you could still be infected with mild symptoms.‚Äù

Just be up front and say ‚ÄúYes, this is the first mrna vaccine to be approved, but it has already been researched for 40 years.‚Äù Don‚Äôt hide things, it comes back to bite us later."
1969,"The coroner doing the autopsy, coroner... Coronar... Corona."
1970,That's  a reason not trust their Liberal science agenda pushing lies.
1971,"He died from being too woke, his enlightenment and question asking was more than humans can handle and that's the alt-fact and are opinions!"
1972,/s
1973,Probably.
1974,"For hospitalization/death you're probably still very well protected, but what they call 'mild' or 'moderate' covid is still a bitch."
1975,It's still a very serious illness that can leave you out of commission for days and get pretty bad with coughing and fevers.
1976,We don't know the long term implications of the damage.
1977,"Also, long covid risk is cut in half by the 1st two shots, but that still leaves it as a serious concern."
1978,Protection against mild and moderate infections *has* waned.
1979,"Not as substantially with Moderna, but it's still down to the 60s to 80s depending on the study."
1980,"So you have to weigh that against the downsides of getting a booster... for most people it's the same or less severe than the 2nd shot for side effects (and it's a half dose, so that helps), and if you're a young man, an *extremely* rare side effect of myocarditis that's almost always mild and caused by covid more often anyway."
1981,So it really comes out in favor of the booster.
1982,What makes you think the anti-vaxxers holding out now will suddenly jump on this?
1983,[removed]
1984,"Jokes on them, I don't have any kids."
1985,You‚Äôre forgetting to factor in a potential mutation.
1986,"Unlikely maybe, but possible."

1990,"What an idiot, lost all respect for him."
1991,"Nurse practitioners do have more advanced degrees than your typical nurse (specifically: a graduate degree), but I'm not actually sure what that education entails."
1992,"My mom is a retired NNP, but she earned that quite a while ago and things have changed since then...a lot."
1993,"It's still nowhere near the level of education an MD receives, but it's also above your typical nurse."
1994,Doesn't seem to weed out the crazy at all though.
1995,Still wouldn't go to an NP for any diagnosis other than a really obvious one.
1996,"I'll ask my mom stuff, but usually it's ""does this look bad and should I go to the doctor?"""

2011,"Where I live in South America it gets just as cold in the winter and houses have no heating, but I still think it's good advice."
2012,People should know how to effectively protect their family.
2013,Being against vaccine mandates is not the same as being against vaccines.
2014,You surely know this.

2041,"While it‚Äôs a great thing for the pandemic overall, I wonder what the cost is going to be and if insurance will cover it if you weren‚Äôt vaxxed."
2042,I guess they will most likely because it‚Äôs a hell of a lot cheaper than a hospital stay.
2043,"And so now the anti vaxxers will have yet another reason to not get vaxxed, they can just take a pill, as if the pill isn‚Äôt just as new and sciency as the vaccination was, but somehow that hypocrisy will be a whoosh."

2195,So I didn't really know anything about Aaron Rodgers until I saw a picture of him with his actress girlfriend.
2196,"My first thoughts were ""wow she's with an old man, I wonder how big of an age gap there is."

2198,Then I saw he was a football player and immediately figured he was retired...because he's old.
2199,Then I found out he's 37 fucking years old...
2200,I'm 37...I was absolutely horrified.
2201,I texted his picture to several people telling them to guess his age.
2202,Thankfully everyone was guessing late 40s or 50s like I thought.
2203,The guy looks super old for a wealthy active football player.
2204,Someone who is supposed to be at their peak and who has access to the best of everything should not be looking as weathered and rough as this guy does.
2205,I honestly thought he was 52 which is like unheard of for me for 37.
2206,I literally do not know anyone my age that looks as old as he does right now and we don't have anywhere near his wealth.
2207,"So anyway, fuck Aaron Roger's, if you want to take advice from someone on how to not die maybe don't take it from a guy who looks 20 years older than he is while in his prime."

2835,Colorado stopped taking masks and social distancing seriously months ago.
2836,Or what I've heard yikes on several fucking bikes.
2837,"&gt;It was almost Memorial Day, and retired Army Sgt."
2838,Bill Meck was thinking about the dead.
2839,It had been nearly a year since covid-19 had hollowed out Charlotte Hall Veterans Home ‚Äî the state-run facility for veterans and their spouses where he lived.
2840,"Before the pandemic, he could usually expect to honor a resident who had recently died."
2841,Taps would be played.
2842,An American flag would cover the body as it lay on a gurney.
2843,Employees and residents could line the hallway and sidewalk for a final salute.
2844,"‚ÄúWith all of this, none of the guys have gotten that,‚Äù Bill said."
2845,The pandemic halted so much.
2846,"&gt;For most of 2020, Charlotte Hall was the site of the largest and deadliest coronavirus outbreak at a Maryland long-term-care facility."
2847,"It remains the second-deadliest outbreak at a long-term-care facility in the state, and among the largest outbreaks in the country."
2848,"So far, 66 residents and one staff member have died, and there have been 411 infections."
2849,"&gt;Among the dead were veterans of World War II, Korea and Vietnam."
2850,"They were Army and Navy and Marines, fathers and husbands and brothers, recipients of the Purple Heart and the Bronze Star."
2851,Some had made a career of the military.
2852,Others had served for a few years.
2853,"In their post-military life, their work varied: a machinist, a bus driver, a federal employee."
2854,"Many of them had come to Charlotte Hall for the subsidized care it provided, a deep discount from private nursing homes whose costs their families could not afford."
2855,"&gt;Bill had lived at Charlotte Hall for about a decade, and in two other nursing homes before that."
2856,"He knew the good and the bad of long-term care, that being close to death was part of it."
2857,But not like this.
2858,"Near the height of the home‚Äôs outbreak, when its infection rate reached 50 percent and dozens of people had died in a matter of weeks, he asked to speak to a mental health professional."
2859,"‚ÄúI have been through a lot of s--- in my life, and that‚Äôs the first time I talked to a shrink,‚Äù he said."
2860,They met over Skype from the room where he was isolated.
2861,"&gt;Bill had not served during wartime, but the battle metaphors still came easy."
2862,"‚ÄúOne of the other guys, he‚Äôs a combat vet."
2863,"He said it‚Äôs like going out on patrol, getting ambushed, and you‚Äôre the only one that survived."
2864,"And you spend the rest of your life asking why.‚Äù

&gt;Charlotte Hall was not alone in its struggles."
2865,"Across the country, state veterans homes were among the most dangerous long-term-care facilities during the pandemic."
2866,More than 145 veterans died in two homes in New Jersey.
2867,One hundred and twenty-one at a New York home.
2868,"Dozens more in Hawaii, Illinois and Oklahoma."
2869,"Seventy-six veterans died in one Massachusetts facility, where two officials were later indicted on still-pending charges of criminal neglect."
2870,&gt;The death toll raised urgent questions about what is owed to these veterans now and in the future.
2871,"The country‚Äôs 160 state veterans homes are not run by the Department of Veterans Affairs, despite the fact that they are the largest institutional long-term-care provider for veterans."
2872,"Instead, individual states own and manage them, and the department inspects them annually while paying more than $1 billion per year for their operation."
2873,"The Maryland Department of Veterans Affairs oversees Charlotte Hall but outsources the facility‚Äôs management to a for-profit company, HMR Veterans Services."
2874,"Last summer, the muddled oversight of state veterans homes ‚Äî split as it is among federal, state and for-profit entities ‚Äî prompted a congressional hearing, the title of which asked, ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs in charge?‚Äù

&gt;Bill felt the government had failed Charlotte Hall‚Äôs residents."
2875,He had spent part of the past year trying to get powerful people to pay attention to what happened there.
2876,"A natural advocate, he had served for several years as president of the resident council."
2877,"At 64, he was nearly two decades younger than many of the residents, and he was protective."
2878,"‚ÄúThese are my guys,‚Äù he liked to say."
2879,"&gt;On Memorial Day this year, the veterans home held a ceremony to honor those who had died during the past year."
2880,"It was smaller than normal, due to covid precautions."
2881,Staff members gathered to read aloud the names.
2882,"But if anyone told Bill about the event or that it was broadcast on the home‚Äôs televisions, he hadn‚Äôt heard them."
2883,He missed it.
2884,"In the video posted online afterward, the reading of the names of the dead had been cut out, for privacy reasons."
2885,"&gt;For Bill, none of this was good enough."
2886,He wanted a list of names of those who had died.
2887,"He wanted a monument inscribed with them on the campus, a way to commemorate what happened."
2888,A larger memorial service.
2889,A ringing of bells.
2890,Something.
2891,‚ÄúHow the hell do I process all this?‚Äù he asked.
2892,He began to cry.
2893,"‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt get to say goodbye.‚Äù Perhaps most of all, what Bill wanted was an accounting of what had gone wrong at Charlotte Hall."
2894,"After all, the residents had done a lot for their country."
2895,"‚ÄúIf anyone deserved better,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúthese guys did.‚Äù

2926,"For the Johnson&amp;Johnson vaccine, the shot must be done by 12/21."
2927,"For the two shot versions, both saw some efficacy by about 2 weeks after the first dose that continued to increase with time."
2928,Regardless the OSHA requirement also includes a requirement for unvaccinated (includes not fully vaccinated) to wear a mask when working starting 12/5.
2929,"Given that the 2nd shot is more associated with stronger side effects, I would bet many of these companies give an earlier deadline or provide incentives to get the vaccine earlier."

4319,"Technically, he said he‚Äôs been ‚Äúimmunized.‚Äù But he clearly implied that he‚Äôs been vaccinated, because he said in the next breath that he won‚Äôt chastise teammates who aren‚Äôt vaccinated."

4321,‚ÄúThere‚Äôs guys on the team that haven‚Äôt been vaccinated.
4322,"I think it‚Äôs a personal decision, I‚Äôm not gonna judge those guys.‚Äù


&gt; So, basically, he lied."
4323,He lied in order to hide the fact that he‚Äôs not vaccinated.
4324,"&gt;And it wasn‚Äôt just his cagey use of the term ‚Äúimmunized,‚Äù followed by his vow to not judge a group to which he secretly belonged."
4325,A G.M.
4326,with another team tried to tell me weeks ago that Rodgers isn‚Äôt vaccinated.
4327,"I looked up photos of Rodgers from the preseason, standing on the sideline in street clothes."
4328,(The photo attached to this article comes from one of those games.)
4329,He wasn‚Äôt wearing a mask.
4330,I told my source that this means that Rodgers was vaccinated.
4331,"In actuality, it means that he was deliberately and flagrantly violating COVID policies to create the impression that he‚Äôs vaccinated."
4332,Merck drug is $700..would anticipate this to be priced similar.
4333,Not low cost.
4334,Probably low cost to manufacture though.
4335,In Slovakia it goes so far that these people go to supermarket (with mask) then at checkout take off their mask and start arguing with people that it is their personal freedom.
4336,Then security and police will arrive and all of them start livestreaming on facebook and calling for justice because they oppressed.
4337,It was so bad that they injured 2 police officers in a supermarket fight (and people still defend them)
4338,"They weren‚Äôt good at hiding it, they just weren‚Äôt gonna kill my grandma before."

4522,"Don't get me wrong, I'm very pro-vax, but here's how I see this playing out:

4529,He really said that?
4530,Also because fur industry is inhumane and evil

4544,Now if I lived in Alabama or Texas I might consider it.
4545,If you don't know the difference between a butt and a face I don't know that I can help you.
4546,"Yeah, the only one not mandated is the flu vaccine."
4547,They tried that last year and people pitched a fit.
4548,But the 10+ ones before that were fine.
4549,So we should go back to a horrible system where people piss away hours every day commuting and spending time around people they don't like?

4562,Haha!

4623,"Okay so covid tends to cause mucus buildup clogging up the alveoli of the lungs which is where air exchange happens, that's not good."
4624,The alveoli are on the back of the lungs.
4625,What do a lot of people do when they get sick?
4626,"They lay in bed..... on their back, causing the mucus to pool and clog up their alveoli."
4627,So what can you do?
4628,"First, if you're gonna lie down for extended periods, lie down on your stomach."
4629,Let gravity help.
4630,Cough on your stomach to break off the mucus clinging to your alveoli.
4631,"Now if you do this a lot, it's gonna hurt after a while and that's no fun either, so take as many hot showers to steam up your bathroom and lubricate your airways."
4632,"I'm talking like 4 showers a day, and haunch over real good to get as horizontal as possible (like a bent-over row) so that when you cough you get a gravity assist."

4698,"As a result, I (and the rest of society) do not have to worry about contracting polio, measles, mumps, tetanus, rubella, pertussis, among other diseases."

4728,But I do feel like she could get caught up in all the fb information in a bad way.

4730,It has been back to normal virtually everywhere for months.

4736,My daughter (9) went to sleepaway camp last summer.
4737,95% of kids over 12 were vaccinated.

4744,No joke.
4745,"I live in AL where the vaccination rate is abysmal, masks are rarely worn, and I am encountering more and more conspiracy theorists daily."
4746,It‚Äôs a recipe for disaster.
4747,"That combined with the holidays where we will have families gathering, friends gathering, work holiday parties, everyone out shopping for presents, the grocery stores will be at max capacity‚Ä¶ everyone just moseying around as if there isn‚Äôt a global pandemic going on."
4748,"Yeah, we finally got a slot scheduled three weeks from now, just before Thanksgiving."
4749,"The only thing worse than having everyone scrambling to get vaccinated would be having nobody scrambling to get vaccinated, though, so I can't really complain too much."
4750,"We managed the last couple of years without it, a few more weeks will be ok."
4751,So true!
4752,In Ireland not so much but schools still require a list of vaccinations children have had.
4753,I think the only hesitation people may have is the inaccurate recording during the trials &amp; the lack of long term side effects data.
4754,It seems a bit shady that the numbers were fluffed or not gathered properly.
4755,My kids are fully vaccinated for all routine vaccines so I most likely will sign my children up for this once I feel appropriate.
4756,I‚Äôm letting the US administer it to young children first then I‚Äôll keep an eye on how it goes there first.
4757,I‚Äôm SO thankful my children won‚Äôt be the first to get it to be honest!
4758,Especially when it was quoted a health official stated that the safety of the vaccines won‚Äôt be known until they start giving it.
4759,Sounds like a possibility.

4766,try cvs/walmart your local county health department
4767,Good.
4768,Thank you for the information!
4769,!
4770,Time to be realistic.
4771,If you haven‚Äôt gotten vaccinated by now you‚Äôre not going to.
4772,We aren‚Äôt going to convince them.
4773,Best to move forward with recovery options than preventative at this point.
4774,"Haha, I've given up on that sub tbh...it's the furthest depiction of the real world I've seen in a while"
4775,Someone suggested it‚Äôs due to them not having much of an earlier delta outbreak.

4806,Less gyms to shower (or no gyms at all).
4807,Almost all public bathrooms have been removed.
4808,Almost impossibe to find outlets.
4809,Food and clothing is much more expensive.

4815,"We have a welfare system, yes - but all those small things like going to the toilet or buying food or recharging your phone eat up your money really fast."
4816,I am envious because of the motels and trailer parks you have in the states - that doesn't exist here.
4817,At all.
4818,Or tiny apartments in bad condition that are cheap at least - we got rid of them completely.
4819,"And I am envious that homeless people have their own subculture in the states that may lead to opportunities - here, this doesn't exist as well."

4822,I just wanted to give you a different perspective.

4824,About a society that blinds out poverty more than you would believe.
4825,I‚Äôm in high school and my county said that the reason they initially didn‚Äôt have a vaccine mandate is because half the kids couldn‚Äôt get it.
4826,I think they‚Äôre going to instate one soon enough.
4827,Some of my teachers have kids so I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôll be able to get the shots soon.
4828,[deleted]
4829,Thank you for this!
4830,I just very easily scheduled my daughter‚Äôs vaccine using your link.
4831,But their actions are encouraging the virus to spread more right?
4832,If you worked in a restaurant and had a coworker who was vocally against basic food safety and intentionally did things that put people's health and safety at risk it wouldn't be all that weird to mock him by calling him pro-food poisoning right?
4833,Half of the people in Alaska live in the city of Anchorage.
4834,I pray it goes well.
4835,I plan on seeing how the roll out in the US goes before I decide if I should vaccinate my kids for covid.
4836,They‚Äôre fully vaccinated for other vaccines that were tested over a much longer duration &amp; thankfully neither had any complications from any other routine vaccines.
4837,"As the health officials said themselves, They won‚Äôt know how safe the vaccines are for young children until they start administering them."
4838,I‚Äôm sure it will be totally fine but I am VERY relieved that my kids won‚Äôt be the first to receive it.
4839,Sending good healthy vibes to you &amp; your children.

4843,&gt; If you DR. Isn‚Äôt pro covid vaccine then I would definitely look elsewhere.

4845,If it's a specific risk to a specific patient based on their medical history?
4846,"Sure, if it's  ""in general"" and doesn't recommend it to anyone then yeah... leave the office in droves."
4847,The first dose is much longer.
4848,I don't know why they picked 14 days; it was the primary endpoint in the trials and maybe they just stuck with it.
4849,But reduction in testing positive/contagiousness is the primary goal.
4850,That does take 2 weeks.
4851,The chances of the vaccine hurting you are infinitesimal.

4935,I don't think deaths are coming.
4936,"There will be a huge strain on healthcare again for sure, but countries that have a decent vaccination rate should not see deaths at the same level as during previous waves."
4937,"If you look at the UK for example, new cases have been consistently at a very high level since early July, yet deaths are still at a fraction of what they used to be."
4938,That's with a vaccination rate of only \~68%.
4939,Most EU countries have already opened up to giving boosters 6 months after the second shot.

4972,That veterans affairs data you linked has its own issues.

&gt; Because these were veterans, the study population comprised six times as many men as women."
4974,"And they skewed older: about 48% were 65 or older, 29% were between 50 and 64, and 24% were under 50."
4975,This is a population that is more likely to have severe disease and does not respond to vaccination as well.
4976,So the drop off isn‚Äôt representative of the total population.
4977,I agree that this guy keeps predicting the end of certain pandemic waves.
4978,Pretty sure he is just looking at other countries waves and when they ended.
4979,I‚Äôm not putting much stock into that just like I don‚Äôt put much stock in model predictions.

5021,After the second time (the traditional supper lasts for many hours) my family told me they wouldn't stand it because it was getting so unbearbly cold in the house and because they were afraid that mice might come in from the outside (as they sometimes do in the winter).
5022,They basically said that we just aren't doing it anymore.

5226,People don't give a fuck mate.
5227,The drug's not used because the data from studies doesn't support it for Covid.
5228,It's an amazing drug just not against coronavirus and people like you make it political for some reason.
5229,[removed]
5230,Yes.
5231,Exactly this.
5232,I think some people think that means eradication of Covid.
5233,It really just means it‚Äôs transition to an endemic virus that isn‚Äôt nearly as deadly anymore.
5234,Wow a guy who has just thrown a ball his entire life and probably got his grades boosted because he was on the football team is actually an idiot?

5278,Antivaxxers cannot and will not accept this simple fact
5279,&gt;Nowhere but Israel and Uruguay are actually highly vaccinated.
5280,This isn't quite true; [there are several countries that have a higher percentage of their populations fully vaccinated.

5282,"Uruguay is one of the highest, but there are still a few that are higher, like Portugal, UAE, Chile and Spain"
5283,"I'm sure that's part of it, but it doesn't quite explain it either."
5284,"Italy, for example, has had several very large waves already; more Covid deaths per-capita than Sweden for example."
5285,"Maybe the explanation is ""all of the above"" and it's just a coincidence they seem to be moving in lock-step."
5286,[removed]
5287,"Yep, anti-vax is very active and outspoken here."
5288,"Lots of my kids classmates are out sick, so they brought mask mandate back for her school BUT they all take their masks off at lunch and recess so who knows if it helps at all."
5289,Neighbor's wife just passed away from covid.
5290,"It's really in our faces in this area, sadly."
5291,Except private schools
5292,Hence why a mandate doesn't make sense.
5293,"The kids these mandates target are already at a extremely low risk of covid complications, and if most of the adults around these kids are already immunized(whether vax-induced or natural), what's the point of forcing kids to take it?"
5294,Yeah but what about all those selfish people with egg allergies who don‚Äôt take the normal flu shot every year should we fire them all too?
5295,Maybe burn a big mark into their lawn so everyone knows?
5296,"I was not relating a seafood allergy to whatever Rodgers claims to be allergic to, for the record, just pointing out how stupid it is to respond with ‚Äúdoubt it‚Äù when someone says they have an allergy"
5297,"Government should protect citizens, not kill them."
5298,"Right, these vaccines haven‚Äôt been around for 50/60 years yet."
5299,"As another example, long term effects of the chicken pox vaccine isn‚Äôt known either, if it‚Äôs actually truly a person‚Äôs concern."
5300,Which is the most analogous to the COVID vaccine especially when it comes to the risk profile of the disease for children.
5301,They're bringing it forward because the UK was one of the first places to vaccinate and efficacy appears to decline significantly after 6 months.
5302,The US will follow suit
5303,[removed]
5304,They'll take the pills because they aren't big scary shots!
5305,Close.
5306,"Governments hinder efforts to control virus, that's how you get breakthrough cases."
5307,Covid told everyone to stop and capitalism said no.
5308,Who are you to speak for someone else‚Äôs medical conditions?
5309,had to shoehorn that in here somehow did ya?
5310,But it‚Äôs also wrong to say others provide lifelong protection.
5311,Their protection wanes as well.
5312,"Not as fast as covid, but by the time we‚Äôve had a covid shot out for 20 years, it‚Äôll probably last better too."
5313,Covid is also more effective.
5314,It‚Äôs a good trade for an exceptionally efficient booster to need another sooner.

5321,"This specific vaccine is a logistical‚Ä¶uh‚Ä¶‚Äùchallenge‚Äù with needing ultracold freezers, storage time of only weeks in the fridge, and ten doses per vial, which must be given within six hours of reconstituting the vaccine."
5322,"So that‚Äôs a problem if you have, say, eleven kids who want a shot."
5323,Most vaccines come in single-dose packaging and can be stored at normal fridge or freezer temps for usually at least a year.
5324,"So perhaps if Pfizer/BNT can at least offer these in single-dose packaging and allow for -20C storage, more pediatricians would be willing to carry it."
5325,[removed]
5326,You know me now.
5327,So yes you do.
5328,And you live in a sad area if that‚Äôs the case.
5329,I just scheduled my daughter‚Äôs.
5330,She‚Äôs the last in our family to get her flu shot.
5331,She didn‚Äôt want her flu and covid on the same day.
5332,And covid was more important.
5333,Just got my booster today.
5334,"And, just like after each of the first two shots, I feel great!"
5335,Boy that living through and surviving a pandemic sure is gonna make my face red when the unvaxxed still ''mysteriously'' suffer and die...
5336,The 1905 case was about a state mandate.
5337,State and federal government have very different powers under the Constitution.
5338,same here.. i received my MMR vaccine in the 90s too but i am only immune to mumps and rubella
5339,My doctor's office told me they weren't able to provide the vaccine because someone in charge of the office hadn't decided yet.
5340,"But one of the offices could, and when I called them, they were Not Amused that I had been told that - they were swamped already and it was a lie."
5341,"I will be contacting the office this week to ask what happened, and if I get anything other an deep apology and a concrete reason, we will be reconsidering which office is our main one."
5342,[removed]
5343,As I recall (because I looked into it to compare) the MMR is in the 80s.
5344,Chicken pox the high 80s/low 90s.
5345,Polio at this point is nearly not necessary.
5346,Tdap is in the 80s.
5347,&gt; almost all children are at vanishingly small risk.
5348,We are still learning about the long term effects of covid.
5349,I know I can still feel my lungs hurt 2 months later.
5350,the reason the vaccine mandate for kids will exist is not for them but for the rest of community.
5351,"Kid gets it at school, and then goes to see grandma and gives it to her."
5352,"Since kids are often asymptomatic or have very mild symptoms, and kids are always Fing sick, they are definitely a vector to worry about."
5353,For good reason.

5355,[removed]
5356,"I work in primary care and when the vaccines were very limited, we had mass vaccination events but none were available in the doctor's office."
5357,It was this way initially because of possible wasting of vaccines.
5358,"Even with mass vaccination events, we always had to scramble to find one or two people who lived nearby to get the vaccine because a few people didn't show up."
5359,Reddit loves vaccines.
5360,Nothing ironic here.
5361,Move along.
5362,"I said what I said- I know you want the last word and fight tooth and nail but these are my beliefs not to treat anyone I don‚Äôt know of, poorly especially if they‚Äôre passed."
5363,It‚Äôs not morally right.
5364,"Despite whatever his ‚Äúmedical beliefs were.‚Äù If others don‚Äôt care it‚Äôs not my problem but for humanity as a whole, it helps nothing."
5365,Food for thought is all.
5366,You can calm down now

5368,Nebraska has also been sending patients to Colorado
5369,Chuck.
5370,Most of those require multiple shots over multiple years for that protection.
5371,"And even then, with the polio vaccine for example, they still want you to get a booster if you are traveling to at-risk countries as an adult even if you got the four shot regiment as a kid."
5372,"You get like five DTaP shots as a child, then multiple Tdap boosters as you get older."
5373,Flu shots are yearly.
5374,The vaccine schedule for a kid has like 25 shots total before 18 (not counting a yearly flu shot).
5375,People just want to whine about this one for some reason.
5376,[removed]
5377,Similar for me as well when it comes to my incredibly toxic family.
5378,"The holidays with just me, my spouse and kid were absolutely glorious - no hours of traveling, no visitors, no family arguments (my family has gotten to Jerry Springer level of bullshit)."
5379,I can't imagine spending another holiday with them again.
5380,"They still are awful with their guilt trips and manipulation tactics to try to get me to visit or have them visit, but at least for the holidays, I'm able to put my foot down - absolutely not."
5381,[removed]
5382,I got my booster when my niece was born.
5383,"Once every 10 years is still pretty different from every year or, potentially, every 6 months."
5384,"Yes, it's much much closer to flu shot."
5385,Which is indeed required for some jobs.
5386,But there aren't many vanilla office or labor jobs that will fire you for not getting a flu shot.
5387,Nor restaurants that will ban you from entry without getting a flu shot.
5388,I don't believe any state requires a mandatory flu shot to attend public school.
5389,I think there's a very valid argument to make that Covid-19 is sufficiently bad and dangerous that it warrants a mandate.
5390,"I just think it's wrong to say ""this is nothing new""."
5391,It is at least somewhat new.
5392,And I think it's important to treat it as such.

5421,Oh wait‚Ä¶
5422,So 20% of eligible people haven't vaccinated.

5424,It's a pathetically low vaccinate rate.

5426,Official advice is to switch to Pfizer or Moderna
5427,Every indoor establishment.
5428,Washington has been under a mask mandate for months now.
5429,[removed]
5430,It greatly reduces infection and thereby reduces transmission.
5431,Can I ask what made you decide to get the booster?
5432,I'm only on the fence because I can't really find info on declining efficacy for moderna.
5433,It seems like everything says it seems to last a long time.
5434,I got my second moderna shot in April so I just can't figure out if I need the booster.
5435,Sorry to sound dumb I'm just trying to figure it out!
5436,[removed]
5437,The risk will never be zero.
5438,Even if everyone gets vaccinated people will still be able to catch and spread it.

5441,"The higher the level court you go, the less they follow precedent."
5442,"By the time you get to the very top, the justices can rule however they like because the constitution isn't precise enough, so any argument can be justified in some way."
5443,Both the left and the right do this.
5444,"You say ""significantly"" and are implying it is basically useless after 6 months."
5445,That isn't true.
5446,It is a great vaccine at first and it degrades into a good vaccine after 6 months.
5447,I'm wondering if the pandemic is accelerating crazy trends and making them occur much faster than they normally would.
5448,"They were already embracing paranoia and conspiracy theories and already separating themselves from the rest of society, and now even more so."
5449,I have no idea where this is going or if there's any way to bring people back to sanity.
5450,It's not like the majority of anti-vaxxers die.
5451,"98% will live, and it's not like losing a loved one will make most of them change their minds."
5452,There's thus going to be a massive net increase in the embrace of conspiracy thinking that was once only 20 years ago considered extremely fringe.

5936,We have a novel virus that will be now circulating along with other respiratory viruses that claim thousands of lives each year.

5953,That did sorta happen with certain neighborhoods getting the vaccine before others despite claiming that it was unbiased and just logistics.
5954,"But then.. the rich neighborhood in town was the first one to get the vaccine, way before the actual start date of vaccinations,  so I got a tip off and got it at the end of the day when they had some extra and no appointment reserved."

6011,Literally hundreds of times smaller than a viral particle.
6012,It's like asking if the wind is significantly impeded by a chain link fence because it can stop tennis balls from passing through.
6013,Maybe the specific areas of outbreaks have lower levels of vaccination?
6014,I know that happened in Alabama and Mississippi.
6015,Yiu must have gotten a rogue because everyone I know has gotten boosters no questions asked.
6016,There are so many ways to qualify.
6017,"Even before boosters were officially authorized, two of my neighbors went to Costco and got a third shot no questions asked In August."
6018,I got my Moderna booster last week and I wonder whether I might have been better just getting a full dose Instead of the half dose which is the Moderna booster.
6019,"Since Moderna was just recently approved, perhaps the percentages will start rising with Moderna people getting boosters."
6020,It would have been delicious irony if Fox pre-empted Jeopardy to air a game where Mr. I-Researched-It-All-By-Myself was benched with COVID.
6021,Getting  millions of dollars and never having to work again after 20 years of work will make anyone do unsafe things.
6022,Well they spent a solid 8 months telling us that the vaccine would provide long lasting protection and boosters were unnecessary.

6419,Brett's breathing a sigh of relief right now that this story is quickly overtaking his own unwanted time in the limelight.
6420,My issue is a few things.
6421,"First, if he was really allergic to polyethylene glycol he would have said that before misleading comments on immunization."
6422,It would have been an easy out.
6423,"Second, the polyethylene glycol used in the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are low molecular weight and even among those that had documented PEG allergies I believe severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) was less than 2% IIRC."
6424,PEG is used in a variety of foods and medication.
6425,An allergy to it would require more careful thought about treatments that Rodgers has not shown.
6426,"Finally, he immediately took monoclonal antibodies upon showing symptoms."
6427,The mist common mAb used for COVID-19 treatment is Regeneron.
6428,One of the inactive ingredients is polysorbate 80.
6429,Polysorbate 80 is structurally similar to PEG and has been shown to commonly cause an antibody reaction in those with PEG allergies.
6430,(Not all patient with PEG allergies will be allergic to polysorbate but a good percentage of those with PEG allergies show the cross sensitivity.)
6431,Researcher also do not know if the PEG is the cause of anaphylaxis reactions.
6432,This is the first vaccine with LNPs used and most other uses are oral.
6433,I find it difficult to believe his doctor would deny the mRNA vaccines but then in less than 24-48 hours after showing symptoms approve him getting mAb with a potentially cross sensitive allergen in it.
6434,He also claims he is a ‚Äúcritical thinker‚Äù and did the research but took Ivermectin which has no studies supporting it‚Äôs in COVID-19 treatment.
6435,He took several supplements that also have no studies proving benefits and took the mAb which has EUA from FDA but compared to the mRNA vaccine has less strong studies on it effectiveness as a treatment.
6436,So yeah I pretty sure Rodgers just didn‚Äôt want the vaccine and has looked up reasons to say why after the fact to try and make his reasoning sound better.

The people who have one dose but not two is about 10%, which is significant."
6953,Another 6% or so are under 5 and not eligible.
6954,"So of the total population, about 24% can get a first shot."
6955,At least 42% (70% overweight * 60% fully vaxxed) will be eligible.
6956,Likely well over 50% accounting for the other things that make you eligible.
6957,But that's based on today's fully vaxxed status.
6958,6 months ago had about 33% fully vaxxed.
6959,JNJ recipients are eligible after 2 months.

7245,"&gt; Embattled Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers confirmed Friday he's unvaccinated, claiming he's allergic to Covid-19 vaccines, has taken ivermectin and accused the ""woke mob"" of allegedly trying to ""cancel"" him."

7247,Sounds like BS
7248,I went out for a 5k jog this morning.
7249,There was a lady about mid-50's jogging **in a fucking mask**.
7250,Anyone with half a brain knows there is no risk wearing a mask for extended periods of time.
7251,So where is this ass-eating mummy?
7252,for journalism of course.
7253,What a fucking twat
7254,This is a smiliar issue for so many groups.
7255,I have a friend who has had to take over any project where the jobsite requires people to be vaccinated because the other person in her company that does her job refuses to get vaccinated.
7256,"I know someone with a government job who has had months of PTO this year because he has to quarantine longer since he isnt vaccinated anytime there is a possible exposure and since most of his office also wont vaccinate, the exposures are plentiful."
7257,It's so incredibly frustrating to be the one to do the right thing and then have to pick up the slack because of those who were too selfish to.
7258,Nothing will ever make me sadder than seeing people talk about enjoying face masks because others will never know what they look like or see them smile.
7259,"Ah yes, a thinker likely to be in a critical care ward."
7260,That kind of critical thinker.

As someone fully vaccinated and who absolutely supports it - no."
7263,Skepticism is healthy.

7306,He coded upon arrival via ambulance.
7307,Died.
7308,He took up a bed for about 6-8 hours because his next of kin was his 19 year old daughter at college across the state.
7309,I kept thinking as we went to his room that he was taking a bed from someone who needed it.
7310,I had to go to the ER for an emergency that required 2 surgeries this spring and I just kept flashing back to how it escalated because of the unvaccinated and wondered who was suffering in the waiting room because of his idiotic decision.

7323,"These mandates are the silent execution of a group of people who are simply saying, ""no thanks, I don't want your business product."""

7380,Ivermectin cures all ills
7381,Thanks for providing a link to a study.
7382,"The conclusions seem to contradict the one I posted, even though they‚Äôre both quite recent and similar in scope."
7383,I don‚Äôt know enough to try to compare them as to quality but I do appreciate the info.
7384,I guess it‚Äôs not so clear cut!
7385,My very favorite part was when he said he presented his research to the NFL.
7386,‚ÄúThey looked at me like I was a quack‚Äù.
7387,"Seriously, the quotes from this interview are ridiculous."
7388,"Everything he said just got worse and worse, it was amazing."
7389,the radio show is hosted by his friends who certainly aren‚Äôt going to question him or push too hard.
7390,And that one 'doctor' is probably actually a chiropractor and not really a doctor
7391,He's definitely above average intelligence.
7392,"I know people love to yuck it up about ""student-athletes"" but during the years that Rodgers was at Cal, Tedford had some pretty stringent GPA requirements."
7393,Even the so-called joke majors at Cal were no joke.
7394,"So, the guy wasn't dumb."
7395,"As a high risk person whose having to get blood taken pretty regularly to check my antibody response because my condition (blood cancer survivor) was purposely excluded from the vaccine trials, this is a pretty big oversight."
7396,"I have happily gotten 3 vaccines so far but also I still have no idea how the vaccine protects me versus the average population, though hopefully some study data will be released soon."
7397,"I'm lucky enough to have the double whammy of likely having a weaker antibody response and having pre-existing conditions that make things like oxygen and ventilators more likely to kill me (bleomycin toxicity resulting in lung fibrosis, heart damage that's a mix of a pre-existing condition and chemo-related damage) so I really need to know how/if this treatment would work on me."
7398,My doctors have been pretty clear that I need a vaccine and treatments need to advance (and we've discussed monoclonal antibodies which definitely improve outcomes for people with blood cancer per studies but I need actual treatments too) before I can let down my guard even more.
7399,"On the plus side, I am no longer on medications that suppress my immune system so that's one thing in my favor."
7400,"He's done playing football, right?"
7401,"At some point in our brain development, we‚Äôre able to moderate our actions to prevent poor future outcomes."
7402,"For example, when you‚Äôre a kid you‚Äôll eat a whole box of delicious cookies and then jump on the trampoline until you vomit, even though your parents told you to wait a while because you‚Äôll get sick."
7403,"In this situation you have been made aware of the future consequences of your immediate self-gratification, but you aren‚Äôt able to imagine experiencing such a poor outcome while you are feeling so good right now."
7404,"By the time you‚Äôre fully matured, hopefully your brain has developed the ability to allow you to self-regulate your behavior to avoid experiencing negative consequences."
7405,"Unfortunately, a hefty proportion of our society has proven itself to be unable to make decisions that prevent a negative future outcome."
7406,"But once they‚Äôre sick and feel like shit, I think a large portion of them would be willing to do what it takes to feel better."
7407,"Because that‚Äôs all apart of that mental cycle  of ‚Äúdo what I want now, deal with consequences later.‚Äù 

‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.Also a disclaimer: as someone with ADHD and my own issues with self-regulation: I think what makes our society‚Äôs handling of this pandemic uniquely disheartening is that these people also have an element of anti-sociality wherein outcomes negatively affecting *others* are *also* not likely to change their behavior."
7408,So it‚Äôs not only a self-regulation problem but also a shocking lack of empathy.
7409,"Still, the point remains that although these people don‚Äôt want to wear masks or take vaccines to protect themselves or others, once they don‚Äôt feel good most will do what it takes to make themselves feel better."

7412,These people really do think that they‚Äôre intelligent.

7415,The second he mentioned Joe Rogan I stopped reading.
7416,You fuckin horse paste eating millionaire
7417,Anyone that calls themselves a critical thinker is usually a moron.
7418,This whole interview was gold

7420,"It sounds good and all, but Imma gonna wait to see if Joe Rogan approves it."
7421,"Funny he's so afraid of a vaccine, but isn't worried about all the health effects a short NFL career will do to you."
7422,"People  are fucking ignorant,  it's  like wearing  a hard hat in an open field,  nothing overhead,  ask them why they are wearing it."
7423,They'll  say it's  policy and for their safety
7424,Have to agree with the broad range of comments here.
7425,"Definitely important to recognize that isolation worked well for some, not for others."
7426,Often that ties to personal situations/means.
7427,"If you got to ditch your 2 hour per day commute, get to work from a nice home, spend more time with your dog/cats, maybe it‚Äôs not all that bad."
7428,"But if you are stuck going to a face to face job on public transit, only to be stuck home alone away from family after you get home, maybe not so much."
7429,Curious to see how the winter plays out.
7430,"Even though vaccines are widely available in many countries, the pandemic still continues, there‚Äôs a decent amount of uncertainty over best practices, and everyone‚Äôs acting on their own risk tolerances from back to normal while unvaccinated all the way to vaccinated, boosted, and isolating at home with full prevention measures when leaving the house, and everywhere in between."
7431,At this point my main personal want is to reach a point where we can be safe going maskless at the gym.
7432,"But given I‚Äôve picked up dozens of colds from the gym over the years, I‚Äôm thinking this will be one of the later returns to normal, at least for me and my risk tolerance."
7433,"This, does put a smile on my face."
7434,The main ingredient that could possibly cause an allergy is usually the PEG aka Polyethylene Glycol not the actual mRNA itself
7435,"PF-07321332, reads like the emergency number off of IT crowd."

7475,Boy do I have news for him about what Covid could reportedly do to an unvaccinated body.
7476,Man NFL head injuries are no joke
7477,Being an NFL quarterback actually requires a lot of thinking and Rodgers is one of the most knowledgeable quarterbacks in the NFL.
7478,"It is honestly pretty surprising to see just how much being able to absorb mass amounts of systemic knowledge of NFL offenses and defenses, recall it effortlessly, and make snap decisions based on all of that can be achieved by someone who is so intellectually braindead."
7479,Cousins at least was just an issue of being a religious nut and even then he was 80% more sane than Rodgers just ousted himself to not be.
7480,Not from the dead...he never actually DIED!
7481,"Comparing studies isn't really cut and dry, unfortunately."
7482,"Some quick checks would be to compare the printing journal's Impact Factor (IF), as a rule of thumb the higher is *generally* the better."
7483,"In comparing these two particular studies, since they are both meta-analyses, one of the first things I looked to compare was the ratio of Pre-Print or Pre-Publication studies to Published studies."
7484,The Pro Ivermectin study above used 16 pre-print studies out of 25.
7485,"Lots of other factors to consider: like how were the studies selected or excluded, what analyzation methods were used, and what was the Quality of Evidence (QoE)."
7486,[removed]
7487,From an ethical standpoint you should at least tell the attendees that you were feeling sick.
7488,"If you don‚Äôt have time to test, then the right thing to do is cancel"
7489,Uh huh.
7490,Only thing I know in this pandemic is that no one knows what will happen.
7491,James Loftens son btw!
7492,About to faze Aaron out I predict.
7493,Maybe Love can take his spot after he and Mahommes each throw for 400 yards.
7494,Seems like he turned down stuff like Johnson and Johnson because of reported blood clots.
7495,"If he was really that skiddish about reported side effects, then he would‚Äôve quit football all together and isolated himself from the potential effects of a nasty case of Covid."
7496,Republicans are not known for consistency.
7497,"Besides, big Republican tools like Rogan also take all the OTHER anti-covid medications, then a bunch of shit that doesn't even help, then attribute their health to the bunch of shit."
7498,"Sure, it _could_ be."
7499,"It won‚Äôt be, not with so many fighting mandates and refusing vaccination and other reasonable attempts at limiting spread."

8284,I imagine Gottlieb is referring to the pandemic no longer being relevant because of lack of impact on deaths and injury while others are referring to the virus spreading across the planet.
8285,"There are many places where covid19 is already much less deadly than the flu is in the US, but they have more widespread vaccination than the US and/or less obesity."
8286,"Its weird reading headlines talking about ""scary surges"" in places like Sweden, where the death rate is like 1/20th of the US rates because Sweden is moderately vaccinated (similar to the UK, which is way behind the UAE and Portugal) and has an obesity rate of like 1/3rd the US (and 1/2 of Portugal)."
8287,Getting people to take the flu vaccine likely is far more important in a place like Portugal than getting more people to take covid vaccines (although they could probably use 3rd doses in their elderly population) or wear masks.

8708,"Yep that makes sense, because the only thing left would be the stonger or resistant ones depending on when you stopped."
8709,That will happen naturally too though at some point from the vaccine or catching it.
8710,"For example, you are vaccinated and have a breakout case but you body does a good job of fighting and then you are shedding virus that either hasn't be beaten by your immune system yet, or virus that is resistant to your immuno response, which will likely be harder to fight for the next person that catches it from your shedding."
8711,"At some point you hope for equilibrium in which you catch and fight it, but it doesn't do permanent damage, like most strains of flu, the endemic phase."
8712,"Keep in mind that such breakthroughs could happen at anytime though, like the flu could do this too."

8743,Or the one doctor who claimed he invented MRna technology.
8744,I'm mildly perplexed by the trend of Covid cases in Europe at the moment.
8745,"Many countries are showing significant, very strong upswings in cases, seemingly regardless of any other factor."
8746,E.g.
8747,"Italy, Germany, Norway, the Netherlands, etc."
8748,"all show very similar patterns: low point in mid-October, but numbers trebling in the three weeks since."
8749,Yet vaccination patterns have been quite different (e.g.
8750,"Norway is highly vaccinated now, but were slower than most of the rest of Europe, so in theory they should currently have more immunity than the rest as it was all quite recent; but still they're following the same pattern, so it doesn't look like waning immunity is to blame, not yet anyway; they have quite lax rules internally, no face masks, etc., but being very strict hasn't helped Germany, etc...)."
8751,This suggests that seasonality might be a bigger factor than we'd previously thought?
8752,"We always knew seasonality played a part, but most sensible estimates suggested a 10-20% peak-to-trough difference, which wouldn't explain this surge."
8753,There are some exceptions to this rule.
8754,E.g.
8755,"cases in the UK peaked at the same time as the low-point elsewhere, and are now down 30% from the peak; Sweden has been flat for months, they didn't even get that much of a Delta wave in the summer unlike everywhere else (they did have one, but it was smaller than elsewhere)."
8756,"France, Spain and Portugal are half-way between the two, only doubling from mid-October, not trebling."
8757,"All three are highly vaccinated, but Spain has been much more lax with things like vaccine passports than France, yet they're following the exact same path...

WTF is going on?"
8758,"I'm sure this data can be used to prove some mitigation measures have very small (nearly negligible) effects, but that doesn't fully explain everything."

9013,I hope those go away as more and more people get vaccinated.
9014,How many are actual local cases though?
9015,"We had a spike in hospitalizations because the hospitals were trying to compete with each other to take in the Springfield, MO patients earlier this year."
9016,It dropped down to mostly local patients now and hospitalization rates are back down as well once they stopped taking transfers

9750,"Think of this, if filters trapped/blocked respiratory gases, the military and police would absolutely need supplemental oxygen when they put on gas masks."
9751,"Firefighters mostly use rebreathers, but that's more so that CO from the smoke doesn't push the o2 out of their hemoglobin, rather than them getting the proper ambient oxygen mixture."
9752,Your co2 changes during exercise because your body becomes more acidic as you get to and pass your anaerobic threshold.
9753,"As your ph decreases, your breathing gets heavier since co2 is a buffering agent in your blood."
9754,"The lower your ph, the more co2 you push to make it equalize as your metabolic buffer tries to catch up and hold you stable."
9755,You relax and settle in to your second wind a bit before you get too acidic again as you near your limit.
9756,"Then you stop, blow off a ton of co2 while your heart slows down and stops flooding your muscles with acidic blood."
9757,"Some people get so acidic they puke after a hard workout, that's the body saying fuck, this is too much to acid to balance without getting rid of some first."
9758,"As long as you get the proper oxygen concentration into the lungs, gas exchange is all automatic, a mask won't effect that mechanism at all."
9759,What people mostly are freaking out over is the increase in humidity of the air we do breathe in along with the increased resistance regarding airflow.
9760,That won't effect the concentration of oxygen getting to your lungs.
9761,Now a surprising amount of people have some type of minor obstruction in their airways that they have no idea exists because they're able to overcome it and push the proper amount of air.
9762,"Well, resistance changes are exponential, so if you're already used to swimming upstream as it is, now you're wearing ankle weights."

9965,"If you're not, I'd say what's the point of saying that only 11% of people aren't eligible."
9966,It's ridiculous.
9967,And this is why no one is going to try to verify your eligibility...why bother.
9968,I just made my booster appointment.
9969,I'm 26 BMI so just qualify.
9970,"I will admit that this had helped me understand the perspective of people who haven't been vaccinated yet, or who have only one dose."
9971,"Personally, having 2 doses, I feel pretty safe."
9972,I haven't felt any urgency to get my booster.
9973,"I wanted to wait for the ideal time, where if I do get knocked out for a day or two it won't inconvenience me."
9974,I found a convenient day with no events or major obligations about 2 weeks from now and made an appointment today.
9975,I'm going to guess that a decent chunk of people who are unvaccinated or never bothered with the second dose feel similarly.
9976,They may be wrong but they don't feel the risk and so haven't followed through.
9977,I really think only about 5-10% of people are truly committed anti-vax.
9978,Which is why we continue to see a trickle of first doses.
9979,"We're still seeing 1.75 million a week getting first doses and I doubt too many of them are under mandates, though some surely are."
9980,The new OSHA rules coming into effect will help keep momentum throughout this year.

9985,Except Rodgers will be fine and Dr. Rogan vindicated
9986,I do think part reason the gov't delayed an emphatic yes on boosters is based in geopolitical optics and non science considerations.
9987,I am just like the antivaxers: i do my own research.
9988,"I think our gov't is an imperfect institution, with imperfect people in an imperfect world."
9989,In this case i got the booster as soon as the data from israel showed it has a dramatic effect.

9995,"California already indicated it‚Äôs intention to add them as requirement after full approval, so likely not until the 2022-2023 school year."
9996,Since school age children (5-12) have far less agency in this decision it‚Äôs likely sensible to wait until full approval.
9997,I say this as a person who was first in line once my turn was up for vaccine and have gotten my booster.

10260,Kaaron Rogers.
10261,What do people think will come first ?
10262,1:The news that he overdosed on horse meds and shit his intestines out and has no colon left.
10263,"Or

2: Begging people to pray because he has covid and is dying in hospital."
10264,"I live in a racist area, and people are often badly educated including the ones who locally run things."
10265,"I've been a little scared of these people since Reagan, but now they seem to be everywhere, and louder."
10266,What's woke?
10267,Is modern medicine woke now?
10268,Was my Mum woke for making me eat my green vegetables?

10271,for me its the best.
10272,Cut about 10 people out of my life I want NOTHING to do with because of 5G vaccine bs.
10273,Its now easy to spot those morons.
10274,Of course they don‚Äôt die in the middle of procedures.
10275,They are lizard people.
10276,Duh.
10277,You must have fast fingers!
10278,The earliest I've been able to get for my daughter is in two weeks.

10289,Sooooo...all these parents that are getting their kids vaxxed think that they never had covid?
10290,Though it is currently perscribed for both bacterial and viral treatments.
10291,It's also extremely safe to take.
10292,So why not if your doctor recommends it?
10293,"&gt; if you got vaccinated it won't stop the spread either

This isn't true."
10294,"If you get vaccinated, your chance of contracting the virus and being contagious at all is greatly reduced."
10295,"&gt;If it also is true he's allergic

It's not true."
10296,He's lying.
10297,He's lying to you to your face.
10298,This post appears to be about vaccines.

10304,"I don't know, considering how expensive it is they might be on board just to support the representation of rampant capitalism."
10305,Stick it to the libs by taking pills they can't afford.
10306,They have low vaccination rates.
10307,"&gt;Vaccinated Alaskans are about 14 times less likely to be hospitalized for Covid, according to a recent DHSS report."
10308,"&gt;Statewide, 60% of Alaskans 12 and older are fully vaccinated."
10309,"The rate continues to lag in the FNSB, with 53% of Borough residents having received both shots."
10310,FNSB is the Fairbanks Northstar Borough of Alaska
10311,I agree with you about contagiousness.
10312,But it sadly also appears if you got vaccinated it won't stop the spread either.
10313,Him taking protocol is likely the best bet.
10314,If it also is true he's allergic then he sadly is one of the people who cannot take shots due to preexisting health conditions.
10315,At this point everyone who has concerns should get the shot.
10316,You can walk into a CVS today and get the shot for free.
10317,It's not going away.
10318,We will be living with Covid forever.
10319,He probably has CTI from quarterbacking in the NFL.
10320,Because people are dumb.
10321,Great news!
10322,I just took my 8 years old and 6 year old to get their first dose and the wife and I got boosters.
10323,We are doing good!
10324,My kids are dancing and like nothing happened.
10325,"I can‚Äôt say the same thing for me and my wife, we took the flu shot as well and now we are resting hahaha"
10326,I hear you.
10327,It‚Äôs just hit close to home for me.
10328,I‚Äôve lost my sister to these conspiracy theories.
10329,I‚Äôm watching her spiral into what looks like mental illness as well.
10330,She‚Äôs become so paranoid and only trusts her chosen podcasts.
10331,Not the medical community.
10332,Not scientists.
10333,Just podcasters.
10334,She won‚Äôt take any vaccines anymore.
10335,She‚Äôs even willing to lose her dental license to avoid the covid vaccine if the board forces it.
10336,She doesn‚Äôt trust these new meds coming out either.
10337,I don‚Äôt know how to get through to her.
10338,I‚Äôm honestly scared for her and so sad as I don‚Äôt have much family.
10339,And nothing of value was lost today.
10340,I booked my kids with Walgreens.
10341,No code needed.
10342,I did notice the next or continue button wouldn‚Äôt work until I pressed yes for the code question and then set it back to no.
10343,"Give it a try, I hope that works for you!"
10344,"Over 600 child deaths so far, and then there's the unknown damage, and then studies find that 12-20% of unvaccinated people never develop long term memory based immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, meaning they'll keep getting sick and damage as they get older."
10345,"Oh, and everyone gets older, it's better to develop safer, robust immune responses to coronaviruses as a kid, and vaccines produce safer, more robust, more protective responses in kids than natural infection from the full blown virus."
10346,Everything you said is wrong.
10347,It is transmissible between people of all ages.
10348,"The more people of any age who are vaccinated, the less likely it is to spread and/or mutate."
10349,"‚ÄúHey guys I‚Äôm allergic to seafood‚Äù

DoUbT"
10350,"Funny, because when they come in to the ICU and are asked if they want Remdesevir, baricitinib, and others, most say ""give me everything""."
10351,Are you implying that to be woke is to not be of the same race as Aaron Rodgers?
10352,Isn't that literally racist?
10353,Link to interview?

Doubt."
10355,&gt;and most people I know will not touch the J&amp;J one because of the risks.
10356,Dumb.
10357,The J&amp;J vax is safe.
10358,&gt;By your stupid ass assessments his options should be either inject the risky one or don‚Äôt have a job.
10359,"That‚Äôs fucked

Millions have lost their jobs for less."
10360,If he wants to make the big bucks he can man up and get the shot just like everybody else.
10361,Get vaccinated.
10362,Quit being a weird whiny baby.
10363,Same here.
10364,I got the biggest immune response after the 2nd Moderna dose.
10365,"I got the booster yesterday and so far, I have a sore arm and body aches."
10366,Glad I‚Äôm not the only one.
10367,3 billion people vaccinated and next to zero substantiated extreme complications.
10368,People don't think twice loading their family into a car which is WAAAAY more dangerous... but freak out over a vaccine proven to be safe.... ü§î
10369,Good.

10374,"You know, we saw this in the mid-70's in my sleepy little LI, NY town."
10375,Back then we simply began to ignore those families.
10376,"So long as they stayed away from us, we were fine with it."
10377,"Believe it or not, those families got sick of being shunned and either moved away or got their kids vaxxed."
10378,It solved itself in the end.
10379,"&gt;In COVID-19 clinical update #87, Dr. Griffin reviews PCR cycle threshold and RNA copy number, rapid antigen tests, hospitalization rate after infection or vaccination, allergies and vaccination, community transmission and viral RNA load, early treatment with sotrovimab, meta-analysis of tocilizumab treatment, antibiotic overuse, and guidelines on the use of anticoagulation for thromboprophylaxis."
10380,Another good recap of current clinical information by Daniel Griffin.
10381,They are against these pills because Ivermectin is very cheap compared to these medicines.
10382,"Although if it had been proven to fight COVID, Merck probably would have just increased the price of Ivermectin."
