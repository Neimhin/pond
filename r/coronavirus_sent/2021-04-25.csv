1,Agreed.
2,The companies creating vaccines have financial motivation as well as contractual responsibility to do exactly what you‚Äôre saying which is stay on top of this virus and prevent a rogue mutation.
3,I think your final point is just fact.
4,"Everything ends, even viscous pandemics."
5,"And although it will be slower than we‚Äôd like, these developing nations will reach at the very least large resistant levels of immunity through natural infection and vaccination."
6,"Got it, thanks."
7,Was just strange to see a consistent discrepancy as I thought worldometer scrubs from the same sources.
8,Exactly üôèüèª
9,"Summer technically starts the 21st of June, so mostly yes."
10,Probably almost all willing eligible citizens (85% of adult pop.)
11,will be partially vaccinated by then.
12,"But more importantly, the entire elderly and at risk groups will be vaccinated for a while by then, and are probably fully vaccinated already."
13,"For example the Dutch expect to have the entire willing (85%) eligible population at least partially vaccinated by the first week of July, over two-thirds fully vaccinated and all elderly and at risk population at least partially vaccinated in the next few weeks."
14,The only problem is the time between vaccines.
15,For AstraZeneca it has to be 12 weeks.
16,"For Moderna they use 4 weeks and Pfizer 6 weeks, the maximum interval within the known research I think, to give everyone a first dose as quickly as possible."
17,"But after the first week of July, there will be a huge amount of supply with no demand, this means intervals can be cut to the acceptable minimum (2/3 weeks for the mRNA vaccine, Janssen 1-dose and AstraZeneca will not be used for a while anymore by then)."
18,The question if things will be open when summer starts?
19,100%.
20,"If they are already crazy enough in the Netherlands to start opening things up while there are 8,000 cases per day and the ICU's are basically full (although deaths are very low due to vaccinations), nothing will stop them to just open everything up when almost everyone will be vaccinated (and thus relatively almost no deaths, which is currently already the case, and hospitalisations)."
21,"What counts for the Netherlands, probably counts for the rest of Europe in most ways."
22,Some countries might be a bit ahead or behind in terms of vaccinations and some might be a bit more responsible/slow at opening things up.
23,But in general the story will probably be the same all over the EU.

26,"Well kids can get covid but not the vaccine, so the % is for sure not split down the middle, which means our natural immunity number is higher."
27,"Id also assume adults who got covid are less likely to take the vaccine, if nothing more than just either being more lazy about it or not wanting to take a vaccine from someone who needs immunity (when supply was lower)"
28,[removed]
29,Just got my second Pfizer shot today.
30,"The relief is unreal, even if it‚Äôs still not in full effect for 7-10 days."
31,"My wife is high risk, and we both have taken every single precaution for a year."
32,I have barely seen anyone or done shit this past year.
33,"I feel summer coming, and lord am I ready."
34,Yeah same here.
35,"I mean its not good, but also I'm sure these are all rural counties"
36,"&gt; Wtf is Biden doing sitting on a 40m+ stockpile of AstraZeneca that we‚Äôre never going to use/need, isn‚Äôt FDA approved

Honestly, it's a lose-lose situation."
37,"If he sits on them, he gets the complaint of ""what's he doing sitting on them""."
38,"If he ships them out and then a ton of people get bloodclots, he gets the complaint of ""LOOK AT AMERICA GIVING A SHITTY VACCINE TO LOWER-INCOME POPULATIONS""."
39,&gt; India is the perfect breeding ground and is literally a petri dish for Covid to evolve.
40,Implying that America *isn't*?
41,"Third highest population in the world, twice as many Covid cases throughout the pandemic as any other country."
42,"32m cases in America, India comes in second with 16m."
43,"Eh, the personal space distance is quite low in Indian culture but the pandemic has changed things (a bit)"
44,I think 3 weeks from now everywhere will be relatively low.
45,Just based on trends.
46,"FL hasn't been doing that bad, and numbers are trending down I believe."
47,"Oh true, I read it as ""country"""
48,Jesus that is 8000 metric fuck tonnes.
49,"80 tonnes sounded like a lot, but in context.. wow..

Out of curiosity, how much high flow oxygen would someone with a severe case of COVID go through in a day?"
50,Thanks!
51,&gt;It would be a lot more helpful if India‚Äôs population wasn‚Äôt so fucking big.
52,India's population as a percentage of the world has always been this big.
53,Thank you!

56,"NYC museums are generally open (not all of them; the Intrepid opened up relatively recently, for example)."
57,"They all require ticket pre-purchases, I believe."
58,Craig has a team that scrubs state's official websites.
59,You can probably search his twitter feed for the full process.
60,"this is why i still fear re-opening, even though im vaccinated the fear of catching covid and having long term effects on my heart and lungs makes me stay cautious."
61,This is because of the deaths that are happening outside the hospitals.
62,In the current situation it is impossible to count the real deaths when the health system has been overwhelmed.
63,There is not enough time and resources to do an autopsy to ascertain the cause of death.
64,This can only be approximated in future by counting the excess deaths.
65,There is no official cover up here I believe.
66,"To put things into context, Delhi‚Äôs population alone is greater than Greece, Norway or New Zealand."
67,I suspect the actual figure to be 2x or 3x but not 17000 as Financial Times reported as you said.
68,This is exactly the attitude that people cited months ago when opposing lockdowns- that some people would never think things are safe.
69,Specific individual vulnerabilities aside- we are in a dramatically different position than 6 months ago.
70,Very misleading headline.
71,It reads like everyone has been fully vaccinated
72,"Florida, and it‚Äôs actually about 3 weeks from now."
73,What‚Äôs the relevance of the 3 weeks btw?
74,It likely is useful in some cases.
75,It just became political unfortunately...

81,*
82,‚ÄòIt‚Äôs unclear whether this is unusually high‚Äô AND they saw similar numbers in previous years?
83,Sounds like pure mear mongering.
84,"India ""ranks"" cities A-1 through C-3, actually based on the tax classification and rental allowance of the residents."
85,"However, though this is the official use of the term, generally it is used to refer to the population density of the city."
86,"Tiers 1, 2, 3 are also known as X, Y, Z respectively"
87,Take my upvote.
88,Malcom in the Middle was such an underrated show.
89,"I don't see any reason to doubt him all of a sudden, he has followed the same process all along."
90,Great news!
91,"Please, please, DO NOT donate to PM care fund."
92,That shit is a scam by BJP.
93,Lol go outside.
94,You‚Äôre not a Marxist epidemiologist.
95,Basically how to gaslight yourself into thinking you're not hurting.
96,"India has less than 5% vaccinated, right?"
97,We can‚Äôt really use them as a barometer for the efficacy of the vaccines.
98,"As for Brazil, isn‚Äôt part of the problem with the numbers is a sampling bias in Mateus made the infection look more widespread than it was?"
99,"I agree that keeping an eye on variants that come from India‚Äôs current wave is incredibly important, but unless the virus finds a new way to infect cells other than the spike protein, vaccines will still be mostly effective."
100,"Cities that's not Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore (Bengaluru), Kolkatta (Calcutta), or Chennai."
101,"Cities like Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Chandigarh, Pune, Surat, Cochin, Jaipur, Indore, Bhopal, and most state capitals."
102,The text of the article contradicts the graphic.
103,"It states that New Hampshire, New Mexico, and Connecticut lead the country in vaccines per 100, but the graphic shows that Maine has the highest percentage."
104,Any clarification on that?
105,I will give you a different suggestion.
106,I might never go to anything like that again frankly.
107,But it's something I can live without considering I very rarely ever went to events like that before.
108,The virus is still pretty widespread and there are many unanswered questions about vaccine effectiveness against different variants.
109,"I want to see what some semblance of ""herd immunity"" will look like first, if it ever happens."
110,And kids aren't vaccinated yet (well I have a toddler so maybe 2022 heh).
111,It will be obvious when the elusive herd immunity kicks in as cases will keep dropping and should essentially disappear (more or less) despite loosened measures.
112,I'm closely watching Israel because they're several weeks ahead of the US.
113,"If it makes you anxious, why go?"
114,Just find something else to do without crowds of people who will drive you crazy screaming and spitting.
115,"
&gt;Is there any source that Modi reduced testing in India, or any place he mentioned that India must test lesser?"
116,Nope.
117,"Yes, but in May and June there will be an increase in vaccination so by July the immunity situation in the EU shouldn‚Äôt be worse than in the US."
118,Many poor countries won‚Äôt begin vaccination until 2024.
119,They‚Äôre in a different world.
120,"Well, most campuses don't exist in a vacuum."
121,You can't enforce vaccination in the local community.
122,"I would love to go but I can‚Äôt just go to Europe on a whim, and neither can most Americans."
123,They need to provide timelines pretty quickly because summer is approaching fast.
124,"It takes a lot of money to go to Europe, most people will need to buy plane tickets and book most of the trip at least a month in advance."
125,"They can‚Äôt wait to provide timelines halfway through May, because then they will have lost a lot of the tourists that would be able to come for early to mid June."
126,Many poor countries are not slated to start vaccination until 2024.
127,The current poor country vaccinations stand at 0.2%.
128,And gates is the person dying at the altar of IP so countries cannot manufacture vaccines themselves.
129,"Lol at the photo, she is in hot water."
130,To me it comes down to virus prevalence.
131,California?
132,Low risk.
133,Michigan?
134,Nope wouldnt go.
135,India?
136,Hell no.
137,3 weeks from now?
138,Should be fine everywhere in the US.

141,That's assuming that either natural immunity holds up to variants / time or we're able to ramp up vaccinations in less wealthy countries.
142,Could see either or both of these happening but it's not a given.
143,"Yep, that's basically my mindset."
144,"Hell, wearing a mask has never bothered me one bit, if I have to wear one then I have to wear one."
145,"But as long as I can get back to doing the things I loved to do before the pandemic hit, then I'm happy."
146,"When I'm fully vaccinated and wearing a mask, I will feel very confident doing those things again."
147,Some people say it doesn't make sense to wear a mask after being fully vaccinated but honestly I'm going to wear one until I see the cases drop to basically nothing.
148,"For one, I'm not sure If I am still able to spread the virus to other people (most evidence suggests I won't but you never know with these things."
149,"Also, The pandemic is constantly changing and evolving, for all we know some crazy variant could come up and nobody would know they have been infected until it is too late."
150,"So whatever, I'll wear a mask until I'm certain this virus is just about gone."
151,I kind of like nobody recognizing me in the store so I don't have to talk to people.
152,EU does have 120 million more people tho.
153,the good news is that the fall semester doesnt start for a few months so theres plenty of time for other colleges to join the smart leagues
154,"oh God, this is so horrible, I am so sorry for your employee's loss."
155,"Remote schooling for young children means that one parent has to give up their job - sort of a problem on the individual family level, but also across the economy that has a massive impact."
156,It took EMA seventeen days to approve the AstraZeneca vaccine after receiving a request on 12 January.
157,Recommendation for approval by EMA and authorization by the European Commission was granted on 29 January.
158,Best case we can deploy this vaccine by the week of 17 May.
159,"Same boat, I can't wait to see mine again"
160,"one world, one people"
161,unfortunately this seems like a slow moving bandaid.
162,"due to how exponential growth works, as well as the fact that any extra vaccines they are able to produce wont have an effect for about 2 weeks, a lot of people are gonna die by then"
163,Am watching taiwan news(seti).
164,They are saying India is 2nd largest vaccine producer but they decided to use it for donation to other countries for diplomatic favors.
165,They saw what China is doing and decided to do the same
166,"Didn't Texas and Florida both see surges in cases last summer, though?"
167,"Being outside definitely helps with preventing the spread, but those states sometimes get so hot that everyone goes back inside to air conditioned buildings."
168,"I agree that cases will keep going down though, especially as we're approaching 50% of the population with at least one dose, plus natural immunity."
169,"I doubt we see another big spike again, there might be some minor ""dying breaths"" of the pandemic where it flares up in some areas, but certainly not as bad as we've seen this past winter/last summer."
170,I understand why.
171,I got my shot at a mass vaccination site.
172,The line snaked out the door and halfway down the block.
173,It took me an hour to get my shot and then another 15-20 mins standing around in observation.
174,"Plus, I had to drive all the way down town to get it which sucked and then I had to pay for parking which sucked."
175,There is a pharmacy half a mile from my house where I normally get my flu shot.
176,It's inside a Walmart.
177,Parking is free.
178,It's much more accessible.
179,"I can wander around and shop while I'm supposed to be in ""observation""."
180,I would've very much preferred to get a shot there.
181,I know the pharmacist and techs who work there.
182,It's a much easier experience.
183,Vaccinated American who also loves to go to Europe.
184,Can confirm.
185,"I understand not wanting to let your guard down, but these articles always come at an awkward time."
186,"The US literally trended down this week, and were gonna see the vaccine start to kick for a lot of people in the coming weeks."
187,Even states like PA and NJ that were seeing upticks trended down this week.
188,The media coverage has been so inconsistent for this pandemic in the US.
189,They are pretty much always late on everything.
190,I'm coming to help stimulate your economy.
191,So.
192,Hard.
193,The amount of people (young Indians) I know that went out partying this year is astonishing.
194,So many of them were just chill about it.
195,Carefree I should say.
196,Good thing is most of them live alone or with other people their age.
197,"And, yes, the quick math I did makes dying in a car wreck look like a better comparison."
198,"So far, it looks almost twice as likely as a breakthrough infection."
199,"And as I think you already pointed out, getting hospitalized or killed by a breakthrough infection is rare subset of an already rare subset."
200,Apparently Japan has a lot of vaccine hesitancy
201,"So my uncle who got J&amp;J a month ago just tested positive for covid today, and yesterday was at a mostly outdoor gathering with a bunch of us who have all been fully vaxxed."
202,"I‚Äôm going to get tested in a few day, but time to see my Pfizer put to work lol."
203,"Has anybody else had an experience similar, and if so, how did it turn out?"
204,There will be variants out of India if the disease infects enough people.
205,"if they are so concerned about losing ""their"" vaccines, maybe they end up getting vaccinated just to spite people."
206,win win in my book
207,Are they even doing adequate testing?
208,Wouldn't that actual number be so much higher?
209,Why does this sub have a mod purporting to have a phd in global health when they do not?
210,"The virus will continue mutating in places like Latin America, Africa and India where it‚Äôs running widespread without much mitigation measures."
211,The risk of that ‚Äúdoomsday mutation‚Äù United States popping in the US is marginal.
212,What the heck happened to this comment area.
213,Really?
214,Indoor dining 100%?
215,Bars are open?
216,Movie theaters full?
217,"You‚Äôll be ok, give it some time and stay off the internet LOL"
218,Steel factories generally produce oxygen in gaseous form but since it‚Äôs not dense hence not very practical for transportation.
219,So the steel factories are trying to either divert their own supplies of liquid oxygen or trying to convert their own gaseous production to LOX but I guess it‚Äôs not super easy to do it immediately.
220,Need to incentivize the doubters to get it.
221,Got both doses :) no side effects from either dose besides a sore arm for like a day after

228,"True, rallies are on all parties."
229,But Mela on the other hand...
230,Fully vaccinated people don‚Äôt have to quarantine if they don‚Äôt have symptoms.
231,Since you aren‚Äôt two weeks post second shot you technically aren‚Äôt considered fully vaccinated.
232,Hopefully the Indian government will learn is lesson.
233,From what I've heard from reddit users from India their government has never taken Covid seriously and the President has been campaign as is it doesn't even exist.
234,&gt; so when you average it up it comes out to something closer to 56 or 55% for boomers.
235,What data are you looking at?
236,"From the link I posted (that I found through your link), the two age ranges that encompass boomers are at 60% and 80%."
237,In no world does that come out to a 55% when you average it out appropriately.
238,&gt;It's too early to calculate the numbers for millennials.
239,It's too early for everyone except the Silent Generation.
240,All others are still trending up and have yet to hit an inflection  point.
241,"Mate, just admit that you were full of it and the data isn't there to back up the statement that ""Half the boomers have basically said no."""
242,Is this reporting more accurate than worldometer?

252,Here in the UK there‚Äôs so many that just do not give a shit.

255,"Per the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/vaers/index.html), the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is used to collect reports of adverse events after vaccination from the general public."
256,This is primarily used to identify potential topics to further investigate with regards to vaccine reactions.
257,"However, because the event data in VAERS is often not verified and is often self-reported, it should not be assumed that the adverse events in VAERS are actually associated with or cause by the vaccines, nor is it possible to estimate the frequency of these adverse events from these data."

288,The situation there has really been bad this last year.
289,How are they not worth comparing?
290,I'm not talking about what I hear in news.
291,This is stuff told by Indians living there.
292,Population wise they are less dense but we Indians are put in lockdowns with no means of income sometimes and expected to behave like sardines when faced with sure death by starvation as opposed to *maybe* dying of a virus anyway.
293,DeSantis isn‚Äôt very forward thinking.
294,Lots of countries require vaccination for entry for other diseases (yellow fever for example) so it should be no surprise that countries will require vaccination for Covid for the foreseeable future.
295,It‚Äôs the only way to be ‚Äúfair‚Äù to travelers from multiple countries as opposed to banning people from some and not others.
296,I‚Äôm pretty sure Canada will open the land border to vaccinated Americans this summer (and vice versa).
297,They are preventing the shipment of vaccine ingredients to the EU.
298,Where is the scientific proof of this?
299,My husband and I got the J&amp;J vaccine 6 weeks ago.
300,I feel relieved to be vaccinated but not enough to want to be around people because my vaccine is less effective than the others.
301,I have kids too young to be vaccinated so I worry I could pass it to them even if I am only mildly sick.
302,I have noticed that I've been receiving less scam calls lately.
303,Students will have to push back on restrictions if they want them to go away.

305,"My reference link is from the CDC, yours did not make it into your post and I haven't seen this in my own searches."
306,"I'm open minded, if you're willing to provide them."
307,The wording on the CDC site is very specific for a reason.
308,The mRNA vaccines protect against the spike protein on the virus that it uses to attach to our cells.
309,"This keeps the rate of infected cells below the threshold of symptomatic COVID, in most cases."
310,The CDC has an info graphic that shows the mRNA vaccine uses your cells to make copies of the spike protein and does not contain any genetic data of the virus.
311,"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html

This is also why you wouldn't test positive for a viral test or antibody test if you didn't have COVID before getting a vaccine."
312,"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/facts.html

Regarding the prevention of infection, I have not found a source that shows the metric for breakthrough infections that includes asymptomatic infections."
313,All I can find is consistent advice to keep taking precautions to reduce the spread to unvaccinated people.
314,"See ""I'm vaccinated."
315,"What can I do now?"""
316,at the link below.
317,"https://www.health.harvard.edu/coronavirus-and-covid-19/covid-19-vaccines

We are also administering fewer COVID tests."
318,"Peak was 2.3M per day in January, and we are down to 1M per day."
319,"We should see a decline in the number of cases and tests - most people have either had it, are vaccinated, or are low risk of a severe case."
320,A decrease should be expected.
321,"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-vaccinations-increasing-happened-covid-19-testing/story

All of this infers that some vaccinated people are still capable of reproducing Coronavirus, even if their COVID-19 symptoms are nonexistent or minimal."
322,"If they truly had a lower risk of spreading COVID, none of us would need to mask anymore (note: I'm in an area where the vaccine is available at no charge to anyone over 16 who wants it)."
323,"Again, if you have a link with the info about post-vaccinated people regularly testing for COVID, either viral test or antibody test, I'm happy to take a look and include it in my future posts."
324,The info on COVID changes quickly as we learn more so I keep an open mind.

346,I also wonder what the US' plans longterm are.
347,It seems like the UK and Irish governments are both planning on having widespread testing and still keeping track of the prevalence and any variants.
348,But US state governments seems to be just putting an end to any sort of Covid related things.
349,"Where is the job market tough, my region is bananas, every store/restaurant is now hiring signs out, seems like any work like construction or anything skilled is months out and 2x what it used to be."

369,From what I've heard in Mississippi is personal physicians are turning down receiving more vaccines because none of their patients want them.
370,"But natural immunity is less protection % than vaccinated, which is near total."
371,"And of course young people have a sort of natural immunity as well, stronger for the younger, and the older are about to have vaccine access shortly."
372,So the question is what expected value of protection (protection % X population segment) is needed for this to hit the thresholds needed to end this?
373,"There is no herd immunity, we are not cows."
374,"There will be pockets of infection ongoingly given the nature of vaccine acceptance by geography, along with younger groups not eligible."
375,So what are the thresholds?
376,"And what will we collectively agree to do to protect the rest, particularly thru coming winter?"
377,CA already at 5 cases per 100k (usa at about 20).
378,"Some folks say 2 cases per 100k, I'm not sure."

428,Well obviously no one is forcing you to get the vaccine.
429,But I think the big issue here is that you are thinking about yourself and only yourself here.
430,All of your objections to masks and vaccines revolve around you.
431,"YOU will probably live (unless you have a health condition you are unaware of), but it's not about YOU."
432,"It's about the millions of people that are living with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, cancer, respiratory disease, the elderly, immunocompromised people, etc etc."
433,"You can be healthy as a horse, get the disease and pass it to someone who is also young and healthy, who could pass it to someone who is not young or healthy and they could end up dying, or passing it on themselves."
434,"The vaccine and masks go a long way in stopping this transactional process, and you could potentially stop someone from dying just by taking a vaccine."
435,That is how it effects you.
436,So start thinking about the community around you.
437,"I get this pandemic sucks and many of us, myself included, have been through a year of misery, so help put a stop to it and get a gosh darn jab."
438,"On top of that, and I know this is anecdotal, but I know someone who is young and healthy who has had months of lethargy and loss of smell from Covid, and another young person who went to the hospital and now has a massive hospital bill to pay."
439,"So think about the other ways it could mess you up, even loss of school/work from being bedridden."
440,There's a lot more than mortality risk here.
441,Symptoms from coronavirus infections are caused by the immune response.
442,The vaccine causes an immune response.
443,That's the only reason symptoms are the same because all immune responses are similar

450,As someone who's booked on Carnival for September...
451,I really hope that's the case.

528,The vaccines are very likely to be effective against mutations that are still infectious.

542,2.

544,So donate but not for free?!?
545,like sell them?
546,Great plan!

549,‚ÄúBetter get yours today before we send them overseas!‚Äù
550,and can only think of india as our cautionary tale.

553,"&gt; So we know that even asymptomatic cases can still wreck people's organs without them knowing, right?"
554,I really don't think we know that.

558,"Wait, so is there going to be vaccine passports or something?"
559,What‚Äôs going on??
560,?

563,"I think if you've got a fever, you're sneezing, you're coughing, whatever else, you should be wearing something to cover your nose and mouth in general, pandemic or otherwise."
564,"I don't think it should be mandated or required by law or anything when we're past a state of emergency, but I think it would be polite to avoid infecting others if you feel you're a bit sick."
565,"I don't think this will become much of a cultural mainstay since anti mask sentiment has risen to extremely, extremely high levels- Possibly a majority of Americans at this point- and we also had mask requirements during the 1918 pandemic, so I imagine when masks stop being required it'll only be a year or so before we stop seeing them in public altogether."
566,"It would be nice to see an ""I'm sick so I'm covering up"" social policy like they have in Japan, Taiwan, or Korea, but I just don't think it's going to become a thing."
567,Maybe I'll be wrong but I'll be surprised to see them in public when they're no longer required.
568,Or ‚ÄúCarnival-19‚Äù?
569,Ignorant AF comment
570,I‚Äôve read a few anecdotes about that.

573,Yeah why bother getting vaccinated.
574,Who cares if you infect someone else who gets seriously ill?
575,As long as it doesn‚Äôt affect you no biggie right.
576,So Fcking selfish
577,When classes are in person I always sit in the front row.
578,"Because if I sit in the second row or further, I will not be able to control myself and I will pull out my cellphone and learn nothing."
579,"I am also a STEM student, and online classes are extremely subpar in STEM subjects (as someone who has done in-person and online, I can say this with complete certainty)."
580,"Every professor I have spoken to has said their online classes are very poor quality compared to in-person, where we normally have labs and fieldwork and it's much easier to deliver a higher volume of content in such a way that students actually absorb the material."
581,I'm sorry but online classes are simply not as good as in-person classes.
582,It's not hard to believe that considering how low exposure we had to a pandemic in the past (we did not see much of SARS or Bird Flu or Ebola etc.).
583,The last true pandemic we saw was the Spanish Flu.
584,"Yeah brother, Indian here with the same feeling, that the partition was very horrible and terrifying for both sides."
585,Thanks for the prayers!
586,:)
587,"Opting out, or not bothering?"
588,Most hesitancy polls I've seen place the people who don't want the vaccine at around 20%.
589,"In my state, Massachusetts, there have been polls with less than 5% saying they don't want to get vaccinated."
590,Yet there are empty appointments.
591,I think that's because public health officials have created an attitude that it isn't worth the trouble.
592,"If you're a healthy young adult who has almost no chance of any severe consequences from infection, why would you bother going through the trouble of scheduling and driving to get vaccinated, and to probably feel very sick for a day, when you're still going to be told to wear a mask, keep your distance, skip travel, and so on?"
593,"The ""Better safe than sorry"" attitude has given the people the impression that the vaccine doesn't actually solve anything."
594,So why *should* they bother?
595,I already got my second dose but I have trouble blaming people who feel unmotivated.
596,I work in a school.
597,Most of the staff is vaccinated.
598,Most students are not.
599,Kids are falling sick or getting quarantined every day.
600,I think the whole volleyball team is currently out.
601,It's nutty and only getting worse now that we're back to (nearly) full capacity.
602,But at least the staff is still standing.
603,So it's kind of funny.
604,We no longer need to worry about who is vaccinated and who is not.
605,It's simple.
606,"If it's an adult, assume they're vaccinated."
607,"If it's a kid, assume they aren't."
608,"It's become basically a joke now, kids getting out of quarantine and then going right back into quarantine when another classmate tests positive."
609,"Anyway, yeah, there's still a risk being indoors with lots of unvaccinated people, especially for the other unvaccinated people."
610,Hopefully next school year is less of a mess.
611,Government has March in rights anyway thanks to hatch waxman act
612,Finally.
613,Long overdue.

615,"I would vaccinate my 11 today, if the Pfizer vaccine was available for this age group."
616,It has been thoroughly tested in the 12-15 yo age group.
617,Not sure why CDC is so slow in approving it.
618,Your point??
619,Anything helps.
620,Finally.
621,We've known this for awhile.
622,I would still expect it to be suggested when exhibiting symptoms.
623,With it starting to turn into summer I was hoping to not have to wear a face sauna everywhere I go.
624,Thank God covid is statistically not a big deal for kids under 16.
625,It would truly be horrific if we had the same death rates as 65+ for children.
626,Where is that?
627,My flight back from Germany was entirely painless.
628,Why did you try booking it 4 times?
629,Did you not realize there was an active pandemic?
630,Will hostels be open?
631,So what's the reason for the reversal?
632,Not just a few days ago the state department denied the request.
633,What changed?
634,"It'd be nice if it was an extreme minority, but it's looking to be somewhere around a third of adults opting out of vaccinations."
635,"That more outbreaks have not been linked to gyms is one annoying, bizarre thing to me."
636,"We know how this thing spreads, and we hear all the time about outbreaks at bars, restaurants, parties, and dinners, yet almost never at the gym."
637,Why is this??
638,The gym might be easier to contact trace because all members get scanned in.
639,Most of any gym outbreaks have only been at cardio classes.
640,There's a Quebec gym outbreak.
641,A cluster in Hong Kong.
642,Not many reports at all.
643,"Only thing I can think of is that the gyms probably skew younger and healthier, so perhaps cases go undetected."
644,Been going 5-6x/week since July 2020.
645,I have zero qualms about being around a crowd of masked and unmasked people at the gym.
646,I feel totally normal.
647,"At a public cafe with people crowded at tables and unmasked, I'm reassured of how normal it looks but also distressed by the lack of risk mitigation because I'm sure none of those college kids have been vaccinated."
648,The pandemic has F-ed my brain.
649,Oh I agree with that.
650,If that extra transmissible variant gets to India (which given the proximity it probably already has) the extra burden will be a mess.
651,You're proposing a false dichotomy.
652,Those poorer countries can either buy the vaccine or have doses donated by other countries (which is underway).
653,"The ""give the vaccine away for free"" crowd has their heart in the right place, but it's just not realistic."
654,"Those companies did not make the vaccines for the good of the world, they made them to make a profit."
655,That's it.
656,"So if you now take away those vaccine profits, you're now making it so nobody wants to make the NEXT vaccine for the next pandemic."
657,"Same for us, we did everything right."
658,I wore ffp2 masks every time I left home (working on site twice a week).
659,"Sat next to a cougher on the train, moved as fast as I could but a few days later I was sick."
660,I'd already infected my husband and he's in the hospital now.
661,Indeed.
662,Honestly the media have completely fear mongered parts of the vaccine narrative.
663,The vaccine drastically reduce symptoms.
664,This reduces viral shedding and therefore reduces covid transmission.
665,Though as a libertarian I do believe in the liberty part :p
666,"I dont understand, what was the reason  for the reversal?"
667,Just a few days ago the state department said they weren't lifting the ban.

968,The big deal is if it is able to evade the current vaccines.
969,If that happens then both the currently vaccinated countries and the countries waiting to be vaccinated will be set back.
970,That means they‚Äôre underestimating by how much?

975,"For instance, my father (72 y/o) was supposed to get it tomorrow, but his appointment got rescheduled to the 4th of May because in my region (Puglia) we basically ran out of doses."
976,"I can see that it‚Äôs getting faster, though."
977,We vaccinate 1M people every 2 and half days.
978,"Not much, ofc, but it‚Äôs better than it used to be."
979,I was in hospital last week (non-Covid) and to save oxygen they're shutting it off at the 85-89 saturation level.
980,I could breathe fine with 86-88 saturation.
981,"I understand why people are upset, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs crazy to give vaccinated people some benefits."
982,After all they spread the virus much less than people that are not vaccinated.
983,"This will be much less of an issue by June, when vaccine deliveries should be larger than demand."
984,Because our ICUs will be flooded and when you have a car crash you maybe don't get the care you need?
985,How can you not understand this after over a fucking year of this shitshow.
986,"Maybe also think about all the healthcare workers, who are working themselve into a serious case of being overworked...How is this so hard to understand?"
987,"Because theres a huge loophole, especially if you are in SoCal."
988,You can book a ticket leaving out of TIJ instead of SAN.
989,"You then use the cross border express, which gets you to the airport in about 15 minutes for 24 bucks total (round trip)."
990,"Since you are going to be leaving and arriving back in Mexico, no covid test needed."
991,Its not just us.
992,I heard Canadians are exploiting the land border crossing to avoid quarantining or paying the ridiculous fine/tax.
993,"Went to several casinos, bars, and indoor restaurants this past weekend which was my two week post second shot celebration."
994,"Absolutely had no fear of COVID, while I know immunity is not 100%, I'm done being scared, I've done all I can do."

1237,It‚Äôs called not running away from your responsibilities since nobody‚Äôs gonna do it for you.
1238,"I do not, it just seems counter intuitive that in the short term, say 6 months, it would drop off a lot."

1247,&gt;Q: And what do you look forward to most when we return to normal?
1248,"&gt;  
&gt;A: I'm  already looking forward to going to our favorite restaurants for dinner  with my family, such as the Adler in Ratshausen or the **castle in  Haigerloch**

[Fun fact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haigerloch):

&gt;In the last months of World War II, Haigerloch was the location of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Physics, part of the German nuclear programme, which had the goal of achieving practical use of nuclear fission."
1249,"According to current view the atomic bomb was not a direct objective of this work, but initially only the construction of the Haigerloch Research Reactor ([Forschungsreaktor Haigerloch](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forschungsreaktor_Haigerloch)),  which was constructed in a **beer cellar beneath the palace church**."
1250,"Through courageous negotiations by the pastor to rescue the reactor facility it was spared from demolition by an American command on April  24, 1945, and today is the site of the *Atomkeller-Museum*¬†with a replica of the reactor."
1251,[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haigerloch#cite_note-2)
1252,"&gt; By working on the biggest logistical problem in the last 50 years

Sorry, delivering less doses over a longer time than normal flue vaccine is done every year is not the ""biggest logistical problem in the last 50 years""."
1253,"Like, Moderna is a startup with no experience making a totally new type of vaccine and even they had more output than AZ."

1485,"At a point, coming very soon, it's either you care and got the vaccine or you don't and you didn't, for whatever reason."
1486,If it's readily available and you haven't gotten it but you're concerned keep wearing a mask and distancing but the mandates need to stay coming to a close this summer.
1487,"All this talk about vaccine passports and it all being required for work and continuing mask wearing isn't going to push is out of this, it will get to a point where we need to move on and if you haven't taken the necessary steps to be protected that's on you, not everyone else."
1488,"I hope we see more mask wearing in general in the future during flu season or when people are sick, I hope this whole experience has educated people at least somewhat and there's better understanding about what we can do to prevent getting sick and that people take those steps."
1489,At the same time the government is going to have to pull its hands back or the grip is going to tighten.
1490,"We don't need more forms and ID's, apps, government offices and red tape over all of this."
1491,I don't want to see a National Sickness Avoidance department keeping tabs on medical records and restricting where you can and cannot be based on your inoculation record.
1492,Has the vaccination rate improved since then?
1493,Will healthcare workers be required to take the vaccine eventually?
1494,Anyone who has been paying attention has known this to be the case for months due to research and anecdotal evidence.
1495,Not a surprise.
1496,Now maybe some of these governors will allow more outside concerts and the like although I doubt it.
1497,[deleted]
1498,I was in NYC in November.
1499,Masks were required essentially everywhere outside your house.
1500,...
1501,"I used the Google, turns out you're right."
1502,"And now I'm speechless, sigh."
1503,Okay thanks.
1504,"China‚Äôs state-run Sichuan Airlines has suspended all its cargo flights to India for 15 days, causing major disruption to private traders‚Äô efforts to procure the much-needed oxygen concentrators and other medical supplies from China despite Beijing offering ‚Äúsupport and assistance‚Äù to the country to deal with the latest surge of COVID-19 cases."
1505,The suspension of cargo flights came as a surprise to agents and freight forwarders who are frantically trying to procure the oxygen concentrators from China.
1506,There are also complaints of Chinese manufacturers jacking up the prices by 35 to 40 per cent.
1507,"The freight charges have been increased to over 20 per cent, Siddharth Sinha of Sino Global Logistics, a Shanghai-based freight forwarding company."
1508,Massively under reporting.
1509,Both infected and deaths.

1511,"My only concern is how likely am I to get it and then pass it on to my family who is not vaccinated, in particular my kid who can‚Äôt get vaccinated right now."
1512,"&gt; Ministry officials said the vaccine was found to be ""suitable for use"" for those aged 60 and older, and were looking into the available data before approving it for use for other age groups."
1513,Dude they are not dumb but are paid by other firms so they are not doing anything dumb instead they are doing there jobs for the companies that own them.
1514,De-conditioning is going to be incredibly difficult.
1515,One of the greatest travesties of this pandemic has been the bare-minimum discussion of the impacts on mental health and providing resources to people.
1516,"When you pair fearmongering media with mixed messaging from institutions such as the CDC, it's unsurprising that there are people who are afraid of going into stores, won't be able to be around groups, wear masks outdoors, etc."
1517,"I hope mental health services become more accessible after this year of collective trauma, grief, and fear."
1518,"At the same time, I think it's important for people like OP to listen to the science, reading their post felt very outdated (March 2020)."
1519,"We have vaccines, new data, new guidelines, it's important we learn to adjust our behaviors and listen to the current information."
1520,"I know it's not as easy as flipping a switch and acknowledge that, but that's why I say mental health services are critical right now and should have been gearing up for months to combat the mental health crisis we are seeing/will be worsening."
1521,"I‚Äôve been feeling for months when they would say the economy needs to open up that they were misguided in their target
Society needs to open up."
1522,People - all people - need to be comfortable in normalized settings.
1523,Large groups of massless people especially.
1524,"It‚Äôs getting there but there are still 20pct of the population who won‚Äôt go out until the next 30 pct get vaccinated
It works."
1525,Let‚Äôs do it!
1526,"Stay 6' away, you'll be fine."

1529,Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) if you have any questions or concerns.
1530,*
1531,I think a lot of things could be fixed by just letting people have proper sick leave.
1532,I‚Äôm fully vaccinated but have two kids under three years old.
1533,Not risking it until this thing is finally over or my hand is forced (e.g.
1534,preschool).
1535,"It doesn't disagree, it simply states they don't have all of the information."
1536,"However even this study says &lt;10% of infections happen outside, and it's 18.7 times more likely to be transmitted inside, but they want more information in order to peg that number below 10%."
1537,Please learn how to read these studies and interpret the data.
1538,"My motivation is making sure people are using ACCURATE information, and not just parroting fear mongering talking points because the insincerity stops people from following the restrictions that actually work."
1539,Much like you're doing now.
1540,Oh please.
1541,I‚Äôve worn a mask this entire pandemic when required.
1542,I haven‚Äôt flouted a single rule or regulation.
1543,I‚Äôm doing my part.
1544,Apparently admitting you don‚Äôt *like* masks is the same as being an anti-mask nutjob.
1545,You must feel real good about yourself patting yourself on the back all day.
1546,It‚Äôs the fucking common cold.
1547,"You can wear a N-95 everywhere you go in 2028 when this is all over, be my guest."
1548,Isn't preventing most infections and making the rest mild to asymptomatic the whole point?
1549,"Without the surges, severe cases and hospitalizations, we'd basically have a random seasonal bug going around."
1550,[Indian Government now recommending the use of masks in ones home](https://twitter.com/pti_news/status/1386644530124918787?s=21).
1551,I doubt this would do much except in the densest slum areas.
1552,I find the masks that stick out a bit like a beak are much better for wearing glasses or sunglasses.
1553,This is grim.
1554,Severe COVID at home is a likely death sentence.
1555,Hospitalized COVID patients with hypoxia consume *a lot* of high flow oxygen.
1556,"Average, duration of 8 days, range of .4-2.5 liter per minute."
1557,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-81444-9
1558,You lost me at y'all.
1559,Check that caps lock guy.
1560,Stay home then.
1561,Don't need you breathing on me.
1562,My suspicion was she did it to steal it and sell it.
1563,Guess this is better but also stupid to not just report the accident.
1564,"Literally every time I post something like this, some atheist has to point out that prayers don‚Äôt do anything."
1565,"Every single time, I get some snarky remark."
1566,I‚Äôm sorry that you thought there was God at one point and are now so disappointed that you have to troll people that might pray.
1567,"First, this can be a colloquial expression that I believe has no secular translation."
1568,"Second, there is nothing most of is can do for the thousands of people who are suffocating to death every day because of Covid."
1569,I can literally do almost nothing for them.
1570,"So I‚Äôm not doing this instead of helping, it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs going on in my country, and even if it was, there‚Äôs still little I can do."
1571,"For the majority of the world that does find meaning in the act of personal prayer, whether it ‚Äúworks‚Äú as you are narrowly defining it, which is ‚Äúit must mean there‚Äôs a deity that grants wishes and the wishes must be  asked directly to that specific deity, and if not magically granted, the exercise is fruitless‚Äù  is a very narrow, Christian centric view."
1572,Sometimes you can let people be different than you and you can let them exist without trying to change them.
1573,"Third, did I mention people are suffocating by the thousands every day?"
1574,This is a really bad take to make it about you and what you don‚Äôt like.
1575,People are shitty to atheists and it‚Äôs not cool.
1576,Maybe don‚Äôt be shitty to people who are different.
1577,Because he‚Äôs smart and on TVs.
1578,Actually he‚Äôs on tv a lot.
1579,So therefore they inherently don‚Äôt trust him.
1580,"And he tells them the opposite of what they want to hear

(Not all Republicans, just a small vocal few)"
1581,"sigh, why everything has to be red vs blue?"
1582,Is it that difficult to see things objectively?
1583,"CDC baselessly advised public against wearing mask, then inevitably retracted it."
1584,Trusts lost.
1585,One way to gain it back is to apologize for the mistake and tell everyone what really happened.
1586,That's all there is to it.
1587,It‚Äôs common practice in Asia because the air quality is garbage.
1588,"So, with restrictions cases are continuing to rise, so we should *lift* restrictions?"
1589,Am I getting this right?
1590,Let's be fair here.
1591,The American surgeon General was on live TV saying masks didn't work.
1592,But the truth was they didn't have enough secured for health-care professionals.
1593,Let's call a spade a spade.
1594,"They lied, people didn't trust them."
1595,That easy.
1596,A coronavirus that isn't transmitted through air?
1597,Pretty common sense i would think for people to know in their field.
1598,See and I won‚Äôt wear a mask outside and when I do see people wearing them outside I roll my eyes.
1599,No shit Sherlock.
1600,There's a 1 in 10 chance that Grandma's vaccine wasn't very effective.
1601,Outbreaks are still happening in nursing homes full of vaccinated residents.
1602,The people it doesn't work on aren't paying attention or don't give a shit.
1603,Speaks of a terrible error culture - the management failure here is almost worse than the nurses' fuckup
1604,[removed]
1605,I‚Äôve never worn a mask outside but my state didn‚Äôt mandate them outside.
1606,And that's why covid came to be the pandemic it is.
1607,People who care only about their convenience not the safety of others.
1608,"If you can't show that regard to others, why should anyone believe you?"
1609,How much are they actually enforcing restrictions?
1610,It has been an interesting - albeit unfortunate - phenomenon to see how and when spikes happen.
1611,If we had all the answer this would‚Äôve been over in March 2020 right?
1612,I‚Äôm feeling this will end up just like how we dealt with the flu and its vaccines.
1613,"A year or so down the road, we will already be back to that old mindset of some taking the shot while others don‚Äôt."
1614,This behavior may be boosted if a certain type of thing like Tamiflu for the flu pops up for Covid.
1615,We also have all this medicine for colds and a few more for the flu.
1616,"Heck, maybe hospitals will have better ways of treating Covid by then, too."
1617,The past year or so showed me such a shift probably won‚Äôt happen.
1618,It will probably just be a voluntary thing some people do around flu season as it seemed to work so well this time.
1619,"Who knows, maybe Covid broke us to the point where seeing a mask in a store during a flu season years down the road will just be common place."
1620,Did you see the protests last summer?
1621,People were screaming and shouting without masks in very close proximity.
1622,"Mask compliance was decent, but not perfect."
1623,"Same with the Alabama celebrations, Tampa parade, Biden election gatherings - all outdoor events with zero meaningful spread."
1624,Fauci isn‚Äôt in charge of the government.
1625,Did you mean a ‚Äúwe‚Äù that isn‚Äôt FL and TX?
1626,"Both famously have governors and/or legislatures whipsawing back and forth a out taking things seriously, and famously have local sherrifs refusing to enforce any rules of any kind."
1627,While bars and restaurants and Spring Break were open and roaring with people.
1628,My BIL is still playing in his FL bar band after his MIL died from COVID.
1629,"If they were to officially say you didn't have to wear masks anymore once you're fully vaccinated then a shit ton of people would simply say ""I'm vaccinated"" while not wearing a mask."
1630,The moderation on this sub makes no fucking sense.
1631,"If they were to officially say you didn't have to wear masks anymore once you're fully vaccinated then a shit ton of people would simply say ""I'm vaccinated"" while not wearing a mask."
1632,Europe is typically cooler than the US in summer.
1633,Come to Ireland if you don‚Äôt want too much heat.
1634,Our government has said they‚Äôll allow vaccinated US visitors without problems.
1635,"Especially with fully vaccinated people being as high as 30% in some states, I wouldn‚Äôt be shocked if we would see shorter social distancing lines without masks."
1636,"We are slowly but surely approaching the end of the pandemic, but it‚Äôs up to us to finish it."
1637,"Get vaccinated, it works!"
1638,https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/223/4/550/6009483 Here is a study that already disagrees.
1639,Even this concludes low risk with significant gaps in the mechanism.
1640,Also there is no prospective controlled study.
1641,"Even if that study was accurate, 15 mins in a crowded place is good enough for decent spread."
1642,Your only motivation is not a wear a mask and you equate anyone pointing out otherwise as drumming up fear.
1643,Covid is a real threat.
1644,Thanks to vaccines it has come down.
1645,Doesn't change the truth.
1646,Covid can spread outdoors and people who downplay that are the real threat.
1647,Their guidelines were set by Mussolini's daugther and son-in-law.
1648,That‚Äôs interesting.
1649,How is the availability of slots?
1650,"Let‚Äôs say you booking today, when will you be vaccinated?"
1651,"I live in a state (Illinois) that is still ""unclear"" but will likely be demand constrained next week."
1652,"I remember seeing a few weeks ago that places like Lake and Cook County had less than a week supply, so you might be able to stave this off another week if you halted for 1 week deliveries to some of the rural southern counties and gave them to the Chicago area."
1653,The issue is that basically every adult I know who wants the vaccine has already gotten the first dose.
1654,"There might be a little bump if 12-15 year olds become eligible within the next few weeks, but the reality is that within the next few weeks it is likely that no state will be supply constrained."
1655,"As a country, we really should start giving doses away to other countries, because they are just going to sit around otherwise."
1656,It‚Äôs people like you who are making the mask issue worse.
1657,Who cares if you have to wear a mask outside and inside?
1658,It‚Äôs easier to enforce and you don‚Äôt have to deal with idiots that ‚Äúforget‚Äù to put on masks.
1659,Or even worse.
1660,More touching of the face when you enter and exit out of buildings?
1661,"Why is there a resistance to mask at every corner and ‚Äúoh i better only have to do the bare minimum to protect myself and those around me.‚Äù

By this logic."
1662,Are you suggesting seatbelts should only be required when going above certain speeds?
1663,"I'm fully vaccinated, as is my family, but we are using all protection measures, including social distancing/isolation."
1664,Seems to me this is just another layer of protection to offset those who still aren't doing the right things.
1665,Sew buttons on the beanie to hang the mask loops from.
1666,The division starts
1667,"Some of us would like to see our families, even if we can‚Äôt go ‚Äúdo stuff‚Äù with them."
1668,I‚Äôm American and my nuclear family lives in the US.
1669,"They are fully vaccinated but still can‚Äôt come visit me, and I can‚Äôt really go visit them since the returning covid restrictions are so cumbersome (like if I was fully vaccinated then why should I need to go to the covid hotel?"
1670,"that‚Äôs wild, at least let me just go isolate at home when I come back) 

Granted, I‚Äôd rather they visit when we can do things outside the house again."
1671,"You obviously hadn‚Äôt seen the video of this guy yet...  

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/hank-johnson-thinks-guam_n_521541"
1672,"The most annoying part about all this is that once it blows over, the anti-vaxxers/maskers and overall covid deniers will just say that no problems existed in the first place and it passed naturally."
1673,"There'll be no revelations for them, they'll condescendingly act like they were right all along - brushing off all the effort we've put into keeping ourselves safe and all those around us"
1674,"Everyone in NYC wears a mask outdoors, and our infection rate was not good the last few months."
1675,"It wasn‚Äôt Michigan-level bad, but it was worse than many places where no one wears masks outdoors."
1676,Let me introduce you to Tommy Tuberville.
1677,":)

Seriously, I'm at a loss at this point as to what these political figures gain by pushing gross ignorance like this."
1678,They're killing their own voter base.
1679,One aspect might be because it's easier to deem your neighbours worthy of divine punishment when they're seen as the Other
1680,This is how my family is behaving now that the adults are vaccinated.
1681,My kids are living completely normal lives (other than masking at school).
1682,"Sports, activities, playdates with friends, etc."
1683,My kids are at higher risk of harm from a car crash this summer than from COVID-19.
1684,"Oh yes, those people are super rational."
1685,"I‚Äôm sure if we just tried harder to understand them they‚Äôd do the right thing, because they‚Äôre definitely arguing in good faith."
1686,If that's not lying to the people then I just can't help you.
1687,They probably stammer when they defend their doubt
1688,The problem is you really don't know your body.
1689,You would think a professional athlete would know their body better than anyone yet every year you read stories of them getting injured getting out of the bathtub or walking to the huddle or something else stupid.
1690,You also hear stories about how they felt good that day and then they went out there and turned in some kind of piss poor performance that they didn't expect.
1691,No one knows their body.
1692,Especially true when it comes to disease.
1693,Unless you've had that disease before you have no clue how your body is going to react to it.
1694,Facebook science research team chiming in.
1695,I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre vaccinated.
1696,"If that‚Äôs all that was available, I would‚Äôve taken it too."
1697,"But I wanted to give my family the best protection I can, and to me that meant Pfizer."
1698,"I believe deaths are typically tallied at the county and state levels, then the CDC or NIH just consolidate that data."
1699,"Almost every state and county has an excess death count significantly higher than the official covid death count, so just pick a heavy repub state/county with one and ask them if they‚Äôre in on the conspiracy as well."
1700,Nvm they‚Äôll still say it‚Äôs all made up.
1701,"I wish I could blame the guy, but honestly this is extremely predictable behavior and the Nepalese should have just closed mountaineering this year."
1702,"Sorry, I meant under 40s."
1703,Have edited my original post now!
1704,That‚Äôs why I read the news as mostly fiction/entertainment.
1705,"If factual distribution of information actually mattered to people‚Äôs decision making, religions would‚Äôve disappeared a very long time ago."
1706,That‚Äôs not how the math works.
1707,"This pretty accurately puts the risk into perspective: https://www.microcovid.org/?distance=close&amp;duration=360&amp;interaction=oneTime&amp;personCount=15&amp;riskBudget=30000&amp;riskProfile=closedPod20&amp;setting=indoor&amp;theirMask=none&amp;topLocation=US_36&amp;voice=normal&amp;yourMask=none&amp;yourVaccineDoses=2&amp;yourVaccineType=pfizer

(closed pod of 20 people is 10% the risk of catching Covid compared to the average person AKA the risk reduction that vaccines give you)

The site‚Äôs built around behaviors that equal a 3% chance of catching COVID over the course of a year."
1708,"No, the surgeon general did say that multiple times."

1720,No some people just don't care when the messaging says even after you have to wear a mask.
1721,That even after that you can still.spread it and catch it you just won't get sick.
1722,THIS HAS TO CHANGE.
1723,We need to start presenting the science that is coming in to push the people who don't care into caring.
1724,go padres
1725,Just because someone did not use logic and reason to get into a position does not mean that logic and reason can't get them out of it.
1726,Logic and reason are the only tools we have to get them out of their fallacious position and dismissing them with this bullshit is just to make you feel better for giving up on them.
1727,"alright, I'll be here for the ""masks don't work"" quote."
1728,Anything less is going to seem weasely.
1729,Good luck.
1730,A vial not a syringe.
1731,A vial of the BionTech Pfizer vaccine contains six doses hence it usually is used for six people.
1732,"It already says that on the NHS booking page

""If you were under 30 years old on 30 March 2021, you will not be offered appointments for the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine."
1733,"There may be fewer appointments available or you may have to travel further"""
1734,It‚Äôs almost that a leading member of his field should go on television and convert important information.
1735,Information that the Trump administration was actively ignoring.
1736,PR for the EU is pretty crucial at the moment.
1737,I'm curious to how many deaths are due medical error.
1738,Especially in the beginning when we knew very little about the virus.
1739,I'm also suggesting that the numbers could easily be inflated or deflated.
1740,The people in power will tell us whatever they need us to hear.
1741,"I was in chemo for breast cancer treatment when the pandemic started so I love to ask people, who say that to me, is it ok for me to die from COVID because of my underlying cancer condition?"
1742,I would get no response and it would make them uncomfortable.
1743,"I was 34 during treatment and I have 2 little kids so no one was comfortable saying yes, it‚Äôs ok for me to die from COVID."
1744,Now I‚Äôm cancer free and my immediate family avoided COVID.
1745,I‚Äôm so glad I‚Äôm getting my second vaccine tomorrow and grateful to all those who helped keep me safe last year.
1746,Point is the variants still aren‚Äôt going to be bad enough to scare younger people into getting vaccinated.
1747,A local high school teacher told me about a recent blood drive at his school.
1748,Most juniors and seniors gave blood b/c it got them out of class.
1749,Students were told if they previously had Covid to not donate.
1750,After the blood drive the administration was informed that over 1/3 of the students‚Äô blood tested positive for Covid antibodies.
1751,Teachers for these kids were questioned over if they had observed them ever showing Covid symptoms.
1752,All had been asymptomatic.
1753,"They need to say that though, the actual reason could be different"
1754,"They'll claim the nation-wide death count is a lie that's much too high, then turn around and claim Florida's numbers are perfectly accurate despite reports from early in the pandemic that the state was intentionally suppressing information on COVID infections."
1755,Sounds like you need to find some new friends :/
1756,No but there is a fair discussion over the nuance of that number.
1757,How much were those deaths pulled forward?
1758,Were lots of them likely to happen in 21?
1759,22?
1760,If we look back on a 5 year snap shot will it even be a visible ‚Äúexcess deaths‚Äù number?

1770,it's fine if they want to take an otc painkiller after their shot.

1825,So are you just curious how many deaths are medical error generally or are you suggesting the pandemic isn't as severe because some of the deaths could be medical error?
1826,AZ's second dose has been delayed for 12 weeks.
1827,So that UK data is probably for weeks 4-12 or 6-12.

2120,In California all restrictions other than masks end June 15.
2121,In my county about 65% of people have already gotten their first vaccine dose.
2122,Pretty much all the elderly and immunocompromised people that wanted one got one so we're no longer protecting Grandma.
2123,Grandma is at the bar with her friends.
2124,"I've already started ignoring more and more rules as are many (yes, I'm fully vaccinated)."
2125,Wearing a mask while walking to your table in a resturaunt and then taking it off is pretty pointless so why do it?
2126,I'm finding more and more resturaunt owners just don't care.
2127,Wearing one at the park outdoors after being vaccinated?
2128,F*** no.
2129,While bowling just order a beer and sip on it instead of wearing a mask.
2130,"The more people ignore this stuff, the less enforcement there will be."

2138,That's mighty 'brave' of you.
2139,In what way does the above depict vaccines not working?
2140,It‚Äôs a literal real world example of how vaccines will protect even those who are not vaccinated.
2141,"Yes, when you‚Äôre personally vaccinated, you are better off, but you‚Äôll be even better off when you‚Äôre surrounded by other people who are also vaccinated."
2142,"And not for nothing, but my state is the current leading one for vaccination rates, and has been in the top 5 since the beginning of the vaccination campaign."
2143,"Because of our efforts our cases, hospitalizations, and deaths are dropping."
2144,Our governor has given hard dates for when all business restrictions will be dropped in May.
2145,"We know what we‚Äôre doing, and this ‚Äúnegative messaging‚Äù that you claim is hurting the vacation campaign is how most of us view the situation."
2146,So you know what?

2166,"If you are taking the overall chance, then you would also want to count things like social distancing,  masks, community spread levels, etc."
2167,On a side note: the healthcare workers study isn't the best study.
2168,It was only done in younger people in a specific type of job.
2169,And the sample size is small.
2170,There are much better studies that have been done in the UK and even for over a million people in Israel.
2171,They show lower (but still good) protection than the health care workers study.
2172,It sounds nice in theory but if you think about this being enforced for more than a minute you realize how insane and impractical it is.
2173,"How do you differentiate between ""Doesn't want to get vaccinated"" and ""Never had the chance?"""
2174,"What if someone works two jobs and wasn't able to get the time off work, and now they're in the hospital and being told to pay because they ""chose"" not to get vaccinated?"
2175,What if someone simply didn't know they were eligible?
2176,Not everyone is very socially connected.
2177,An unemployed twenty year old who doesn't watch the news could conceivably be unaware that they're eligible.

2181,"What if there's a reclusive, rural person who doesn't have a car or friends who could drive them to a vaccination site?"
2182,Are they responsible for their bills if they get infected?
2183,Why shouldn't the government body enforcing this policy be responsible for bringing the vaccine to them?
2184,"If they can call an ambulance to go to the hospital when they get infected, can they call one now to go to a hospital and get vaccinated?"
2185,"If not, why is it ethical to make them pay for the former when they can't even do the latter?"
2186,What if someone isn't mentally well enough to go through the process of getting both doses?
2187,"There's an incoherent homeless man who spends all day outside a Dunkin' near my house and I'm almost positive there's no one who knows him well enough to get vaccinated, much less follow up on his second dose, I'm honestly not even sure if he knows there's a vaccine."
2188,"If he gets sick, do you make him pay because he ""chose"" not to get vaccinated?"
2189,"Hell, let's make it a little harder: What if someone is a schizophrenic individual who actually could be convinced there are microchips or DNA rewriting proteins inside the vaccine?"
2190,Should they be punished for being afraid of it when they're mentally prone to that fear?
2191,This kind of statement gets made by someone who has a nauseatingly diminished view of the world informed by their own self superior attitude.
2192,"When you spend all day on Reddit or Twitter or watching the news, you think that anyone who doesn't get vaccinated must just be an idiot or someone who believes in some ridiculous conspiracy theory."
2193,But it's never that simple.
2194,You cannot base your policy and world view around the easiest ethical questions in the world because then you're responsible when the harder ones come up.

2205,Is your big gotcha that they worked behind the scenes to make this happen?
2206,I think it's because of how messy and unprofessional AZ has been with how they handled everything in comparison to J&amp;J who is also dealing with the same blood clot problem.
2207,I think Canada is plenty cold enough?
2208,Not even sure they'd need the freezers.

2270,This was the east bay too.
2271,That seems like a reasonable proposal.
2272,If you come down with a vaccine preventable disease and your only reason for not having the vaccine is your choice you should have to pay out of pocket.
2273,If you‚Äôre in a country with universal healthcare tax dollars shouldn‚Äôt help you out and if you‚Äôre in a country like the US your insurance shouldn‚Äôt have to pay.

&gt;The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine has not undergone the same type of review as an FDA-approved or cleared product."
2285,"FDA may issue an EUA when certain criteria are met, which includes that there are no adequate, approved, available alternatives."

2315,"&amp;#x200B;

All this other talk is hot air -- the US allowing export of some of its raw ingredients won't lead to more vaccines being produced, just where they end up being produced at (and thus whom controls them)."
2316,"As you mentioned, if we had/will open up export of some raw ingredients to India, they would have just nationalized it for themselves at this point also because their outbreak is on-pace to be as bad or worse per capita than America's -- so they're doing what America did when they had the worst outbreak in the world -- pull whatever levers they can to make it better."
2317,"Shitfting precursors and supplies around is a net-zero game, unless you can point me to where a bunch is going into the trash, or capacity is being idled."
2318,I believe that every single ounce of ingredients is getting used to be turned into vaccinations already currently.
2319,"If it isn't, then shame on those companies/nations."
2320,India for pride and PR purposes only wanted to utilize vaccines that were produced within their border....up until this got out of hand for them.
2321,Possibly having Biden allow for IP relief so production can be expanded in many other countries would be a higher ROI.
2322,"Oh, ok, not quite as bad as I thought, thanks."

2332,This proves that it was all bullshit.
2333,That it's just as easy to catch COVID on a plane as it is in any enclosed space.
2334,So how the hell did those studies reach their conclusion when there's been 5 or 6 cases now where full flights have been infected with COVID...

2359,"We don't know that it's less effective for them, we only know that some research showed lower levels of antibodies for blood cancer patients which may or may not translate into less real world protection."
2360,Most of the vaccines showed comparable efficacy between the elderly and the young.

2364,It‚Äôs not just all over the country.
2365,A lot of students come from places such as India that are having huge spikes in cases.
2366,Scapegoat means to blame someone else for your faults.
2367,In this case the blame however rests indeed with Astrazeneca.
2368,"Had they been even remotely realistic about what they could deliver, the EU could have taken additional action to get more jabs."
2369,"As it were, they ordered more than enough and also early enough had those promises even just approximately been met."

2372,"&gt; All along we‚Äôve been hearing that airplanes are safe

Huh?"
2373,I've never heard that from any public health experts.
2374,"And there is a reason most airlines require masks, leave middle seats unfilled, etc."
2375,"&gt; The thing is, why does it matter if a few people had COVID?"
2376,I cannot believe you are saying this after over a year of watching millions die.
2377,"Europe is probably fine now, we're getting tons of vaccines and most 65+ are vaccinated."
2378,Send them to poor countries.
2379,AstraZeneca only has itself to blame for this though.
2380,Why are you ignoring that the vaccine production is being blocked by the US?
2381,"The proposal to temporarily waive the WTO‚Äôs intellectual property rules was put forward by South Africa and India in October, and will be a focus at the body‚Äôs meeting early next month."
2382,Over 60 former heads of state and 100 Nobel Prize winners Wednesday signed a letter to Biden backing the effort.
2383,"In February, more than 400 prominent U.S. health, faith, consumer, labor, development and other organizations wrote Biden urging him to reverse Trump‚Äôs block on the waiver."
2384,Many developing nations argue that the United States and other wealthy Western countries could rapidly boost global vaccine supplies by temporarily suspending pharmaceutical companies‚Äô intellectual property rights.
2385,"That could allow poorer countries to produce their own versions of trademarked vaccines, such as Pfizer‚Äôs or Moderna‚Äôs."
2386,"In March, the United States, Britain and members of the European Union blocked a World Trade Organization proposal backed by roughly 80 nations, including India and South Africa, to waive patent protections for coronavirus vaccines."
2387,The WTO plans to revisit the issue in May.
2388,"A group of U.S. senators led by Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., along with former heads of state and Nobel laureates, have urged Biden to support a temporary waiver."
2389,"India, a massive vaccine maker ‚Äì mostly producing the AstraZeneca formula ‚Äì has largely stopped exporting as its own surge worsens, dealing a major setback to the slow COVAX rollout."
2390,"The global initiative had expected 71% of its initial doses to come from India‚Äôs Serum Institute, the country‚Äôs largest vaccine maker."
2391,"But so far, COVAX has delivered 43 million doses of its 2 billion-dose goal this year."
2392,"Critics in India, in turn, have blamed the United States for policies that have curbed the export of vaccines ‚Äì as well as the supplies used to make them."
2393,The Trump administration tapped the Defense Production Act to hasten vaccine development.
2394,"The Biden administration has also used it, including to increase production of materials used in vaccine manufacturing."
2395,Well yes and no.
2396,Some studies have shown people to be in the hospital with unconfirmed covid with multiple failed tests until they tested a specific region of their body.
2397,"In other words, sometimes it may not show the antigen in the nasal/larynx region."
2398,"So I think new testing guidelines should be put in place for testing this, this or this upon a negative."
2399,Otherwise you‚Äôll need PCR but even some PCR‚Äôs are not working for some variants although thank goodness its not the majority.
2400,"Sure, but I can't do anything about that."
2401,Can you?
2402,Do you have a way to make them get vaccinated?
2403,Do you have a way to make them wear masks?
2404,We're not sure how long it will last; COVID-19 has only existed since late 2019.
2405,"However, some people have reported these symptoms improving over time"
2406,Efficacy is 90% at best for all of the vaccines.
2407,"So there's a 1 in 10 chance of a vaccinated person getting infected and potentially spreading it to vulnerable people because they ""don't need a mask""."
2408,Maybe don't ignore the news articles about nursing homes full of fully vaccinated people having outbreaks.
2409,Those are facts based on data and things that actually happened.
2410,"Yea I certainly hope that's a long term trend, but that's only compared to 11 days ago."
2411,Compare it to 5 weeks ago and the numbers are up.
2412,"7-day moving average was down to 54,061 as of 5 weeks ago."
2413,My point is that the US hasn't had a consistent downward trajectory over the past 2 months or so despite all these vaccinations.
2414,"It went down a little bit, then up a little bit, now it's gone back down a little bit."
2415,"Hopefully that trajectory continues, but who really knows."
2416,All I'm saying is that using the US as an example of how to get rid of COVID doesn't really make a lot of sense considering COVID doesn't seem to be going away as of now.
2417,Just get another
2418,"&gt;87.8% of the eligible population had received at least one dose as of Friday

I was expecting it to be a small difference compared to the rest of the country but that's simply incredible."
2419,I don't think there's any state whose eligible population has anything close to that percentage.
2420,"I think it's going to be important to keep a close eye on case numbers here, because assuming people go back for their second dose, they'll absolutely be well past herd immunity in a few weeks."
2421,Isn't here also a Catalent plant?
2422,[deleted]
2423,"I wonder if it depends on how long someone would have to wait or just on the GP, I'm 25 and when I contacted my GP they told me I 'needed' to have Pfizer and that they didn't have any available but that they'd contact me once they did."
2424,"I only had to wait for like two days though, but they definitely didn't go straight to AZ instead."
2425,this screams faker than all the negative tests from the India-HK flight
2426,"I'm a little confused too, did the 4M doses that they shared with Canada and Mexico not pass quality checks then?"
2427,What was different about them?
2428,We recently learned that they were also made by Emergent so it's not like they came from a better factory.
2429,Finally!
2430,"Let's hope restrictions on other vaccines are lifted aswell sooner rather than later, because if it's true that the US produces like 6m doses and puts 3m into arms daily, it can more than afford it."
2431,They're already darn late to the export party.
2432,One of the cruise lines already announced this policy.
2433,I want to say Royal Caribbean?
2434,"I would not be the least bit surprised if Disney parks did too, for adults, of course, since we haven‚Äôt approved vaccinating kids yet."
2435,They should have been sharing since day 1
2436,Same reason they did not cancelled with China last year (atleast in time).
2437,"50 Years from now, people will laugh at us"
2438,I wouldn't be surprised if they have long hair and tuck it into one.
2439,It's either that or a hair net at a lot of jobs.
2440, \&gt;So you are saying it bothers you they take precautionary measures until it's confirmed a vaccinated person barely sheds virus IF asymptomatic?
2441,"That's not the point we're at anymore, so why are we still pretending otherwise?"
2442,"We waited for the actual data, we got the data, and now our guidance needs to reflect that."
2443,Will the EU allow dual citizens to fly back from the US to the EU unvaccinated perhaps with a neg PCR test?
2444,"We're still about 5-6 weeks away from that point, but after that, yeah I agree 100%"
2445,I'm seeing 53% with one shot on the CDC site.
2446,[https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations)
2447,Somebody knows how things work in WVA.
2448,"Revive Therapeutics $RVV is way ahead , bucillamine is a cheap at home therapeutic."
2449,"No, he didn't."
2450,He gave a very specific goal of 70%
2451,Linking reopenings with vaccine percentages is a great motivators for fence-sitters to go get vaccinated.
2452,"However, bribing them directly may be a better alternative."
2453,The point isn‚Äôt to make the vaccinated feel better.
2454,The point is to keep the unvaccinated from mingling with each other and spreading covid and giving a carrot to them to get vaccinated.
2455,I agree the time to plan this was months ago.
2456,But here we are.
2457,"If we can‚Äôt get enough people to take the vaccine to get death rates down to a reasonable number, we will need some kind of policy to incent vaccinations and give those who made the responsible choice freedom to live their lives while keeping covid in check among those who didn‚Äôt."
2458,"dunno, but i know that in a lot of cities, even ones in california, the police departments gobbled up a ton of coronavirus stimulus money and didnt really use them for anything but their own paychecks."
2459,"which is sad because corona has killed more police officers than active shooters have, yet cops still wasted stimulus money on shit they dont need"
2460,There is a large market for immature bonds.
2461,"I've bought and sold immature bonds before, though I've only done AAA company bonds."
2462,Florida's cases have been on the decline for a week now.
2463,"I don‚Äôt know their actual plan, but if the government has bought and paid for those deliveries, then they should be the ones distributing and can consider things like need and urgency to best reduce global effects like mutations rather than just putting them up for sale to the highest international bidder."
2464,"Once US production has actually ramped to a surplus above and beyond currently ordered vaccines by the government, then the export ban will come down in a hurry anyway."
2465,"Thinking back to 2020, it's so odd how we had to discover that the coronavirus, which we've been dealing with for a looong time before this novel iteration, is mostly driven by ventilation."
2466,Going from surface/distance conventional wisdom to where we are now is kind of amazing.
2467,"Seems like to me it's a pretty easy dividing line going forward, not just for coronavirus but if you'd like to try to dodge any of the respiratory diseases going forward."
2468,"Inside, wear a mask."
2469,"Outside, unless you're in a crowd, do what you want."
2470,"Also, if you must be inside, only linger in places with awesome ventilation and look for cues like open windows/doors, fans, etc."
2471,"If they've closed it up and cranked up the heat or A/C, try to avoid or get in and out asap."
2472,"Once it gets inside your home, you're probably fucked."
2473,That isn't a margin of error.
2474,Are you aware of how confidence intervals work?
2475,And I won't try to convince you otherwise.
2476,Your mind is already made up.
2477,But it's that sort of selfishness that has paved our course for the last year.
2478,I'm done.
2479,Paying people is absolutely pandering to their self interests
2480,That's just population size and age though.
2481,"Florida's cases per 100K is high, no doubt, but it's barely half of where Michigan is and comparable to many other states (PA, NJ, NY, IL, MN, etc.)."
2482,"Texas is much, much lower (less than half of NY and a fifth of MI) despite all of the dire predictions following Abbott's removal of the mask mandate."
2483,There's nothing wrong with incentivizing selfishness as long as you get good results
2484,It's still in about 4 months.
2485,There's plenty of time for the situation in NY to improve.
2486,But I'm just glad they're hosting it in any capacity this year; last year it got canceled entirely.
2487,Better than nothing I guess.
2488,"We've got to remember the parable of the fisherman and the fish; if we don't be content with the reopening conditions we're given and keep begging for 2019 normal and flaunting the guidelines, they may need to reverse reopening because we're driving statistics up."
2489,They should also give out free hunting and fishing licenses to everyone who gets the vaccine but that's just my personal opinion
2490,"Convenience, eh?"
2491,To think I drove 110 miles roundtrip to get my Moderna shot back in January.
2492,In Scotland we have a blue envelope through the door with your appointment details.
2493,The scarcity and excitement means that we‚Äôre all desperately waiting for them.
2494,Miss it and you miss out (not really).
2495,We have 98% take up for the over 50s jabbed now (1st jab).
2496,Blue envelopes are the way to go.
2497,"Oh, and a healthcare system that is very highly trusted and free."
2498,But that‚Äôs one for the long term in the USA.
2499,Trust me on the blue envelopes.
2500,Not sure we are looking at the same data.
2501,The US will struggle to reach 65% vaccinated.
2502,"Even democratic states are starting to slow down vaccinations, and overall, the US is already down 20% in daily vaccinations administered from a couple  of weeks ago."
2503,"Yea, quick resolutions to public health issues during a pandemic are just dreadful."
2504,"well its the carrot or the stick dilemma and as long as it fulfills the ultimate goal, which is getting people vaccinated, both are ethically sound"

2509,"We also need to keep in mind that natural infections *do* confer substantial immunity, so they do count towards herd immunity."
2510,"Since there's probably a decent correlation between those who don't want to get vaccinated and those who got infected at some point over the last year, it really might not be a big deal at all."
2511,I personally will take all of the leftovers for myself
2512,"&gt; True, but government isn't involved in Healthcare in the US."

2568,It makes you think about how people view themselves in their community and the impact it has on population health.
2569,"I‚Äôd wager the Navajo trust their neighbours and want to guarantee their safety more than the typical American suburb, so there‚Äôs more buy-in for the vaccine."

2586,"This was just more wide spread
Come check my passport and air miles before you speak."
2587,He's a terrible PM
2588,But the problem with that is that there's no plan.
2589,"No one planned for vaccine passports so minus New York, no one is using them."
2590,"So now those of us who are vaccinated have to wait around for government and private industry to decide what they're doing with vaccine passports  (addressing hopefully some of the very real issues of equity and privacy, if you trust corporate America to not save that data, you're naive.)"
2591,"meanwhile vaccines are available to everyone, so the passport would just make vaccinated people *feel* safer."
2592,"The time to plan and litigate vaccine passports was like 8-10 months ago when we knew a vaccine was coming, because now we have no plan, very little infrastructure for them, and businesses who haven't been in the loop so likely won't bother with the passport anyway...all while time passes and more get vaccinated."
2593,"So, because of mismanagement, we effectively have taken something that could have been helpful if planned months ago, and turned it into security theater that is coming once we've already begun mass vaccination and is likely to have a lower adoption rate."

2595,This is the solution I believe.
2596,Relying on people to do the 'right thing' probably is not going to work in our society.
2597,That age group isn't scared enough of covid to feel any urgency about getting vaccinated.
2598,&gt; by saying vaccinated people don‚Äôt need masks.
2599,"I mean.. they are already saying that (CDC already says that ""vaccinated people can mingle with other vaccinated people indoors without masks"")."
2600,It's not possible for a Health Dept to give out some simplistic (binary) Yes-No answer to the masking question.
2601,It's just not that simple of an equation.
2602,"Whether you need to mask or not is going to depend on a wide variety of factors (what combination of people you're mingling with (vaccinated or unvaccinated), what your medical background is, what the other people's medical background is,."
2603,etc..etc).
2604,There's just to many variables to make any simplistic statement.

2652,"If you add in a natural slowdown, complete re-opening would be by the end of June hopefully."
2653,And that would also include sensible rollbacks along the way like removal of outdoor mask mandate.
2654,And I know WV is basing their repeal of mask mandate at 70% off first doses only
2655,Um no - Portugal was if anything a little behind the EU average (and we vaccinated politicians and policemen first for some reason).
2656,"Only recently has the pace picked up - 21% now first jab, probably only 10-15% with time enough to be effective."
2657,Lockdown saved us.
2658,"&gt; I‚Äôm 27

Holy shit you're invincible!!!"
2659,There's a bunch of Ebola cases in Africa we need you to go take a look at.
2660,When can we ship you out?
2661,I worry that masks will be recommended (i.e.
2662,required at all major establishments) for a considerable amount of time past what is necessary.
2663,How generous to share the most questionable ones üòÇ
2664,When would you take it.
2665,Would you take it like a supplement (as a preventative measure) or right at the first sign of being sick?
2666,"It seems that if it stops replication, it would need to be in your system at all times so it could be there BEFORE the virus."
2667,Did I miss something?
2668,[deleted]
2669,"Sadly, no."
2670,"Iowa is pretty piss poor with anything to do, including roller skating"
2671,"Car insurance companies are free to do ""safe driver"" discounts, but god forbid we have a ""not a fucking fatass"" discount on health insurance."
2672,"Which I already admitted in a separate comment, so thanks for the redundant ‚Äúcorrection‚Äù I guess."
2673,And that‚Äôs not what he was saying anyway lol.
2674,"&gt;all the people your country fucked over because you people couldn‚Äôt get your shit together probably wish your efforts were less selfish 

What are you talking about?"
2675,"Call me what you want, selfish, stupid, etc..."
2676,I cannot stress how much I don‚Äôt care.
2677,"I, nor most people, am not going to give up a decade of social aspects of life because of Covid, and you and the OP suggesting people do that are delusional."
2678,Talk about ‚Äúcan‚Äôt fix stupid.‚Äù
2679,"[This CDC study](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/p0329-COVID-19-Vaccines.html) found that, ""Following a single dose of either [mRNA] vaccine, the participants‚Äô risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 was reduced by 80 percent two or more weeks after vaccination."""
2680,"Its crazy how people dont believe covid is real in the US, and then there is India"
2681,He probably meant follow the UKs example.
2682,But I also read it the way you did initially
2683,[removed]
2684,Definitely a concern.
2685,"I was booking my travel to Europe a few weeks ago and decided to go in December instead of the summer, precisely for this reason."
2686,I'm in Philly.
2687,I got mine at a Rite Aid.
2688,I made an appointment.
2689,I walked in 5 minutes before the appointment.
2690,There were a total of maybe 4 other people there.
2691,"I waited a few minutes, got the shot and then waited a bit before leaving."
2692,Mask compliance hasn't been an issue in Philly since the Fall.
2693,Getting the shot was no riskier than a routine grocery trip.
2694,Or they didn't want to tell you where they actually got it.
2695,The EU will not be shut down this summer.
2696,"There will probably be restrictions, but you will be able to eat, shop and sightsee."
2697,Vaccination is going increasingly well and the EU is now vaccinating nearly 3M per day and actually more than the US on average.
2698,"Personally, I hadn't checked this forum since last spring."
2699,This forum held no appeal to me in the summer/fall when it was just criticizing anyone trying to leave their house for any reason.
2700,"Now that there's a lot of hope and people are getting vaccinated, the forum gives me great news on the potential end of the pandemic and restrictions being eased."
2701,"I can only speak for myself, but I'm assuming this is pretty common."
2702,hpv too
2703,What
2704,"I had no social anxiety before the pandemic, but I do have anxiety about returning to normal now."
2705,I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs true that only people with prior social anxiety are affected.
2706,I know on friday I said I was done checking our daily numbers as I've got my second shot but I couldn't help myself.
2707,Ohio just saw it's lowest day of cases since September of last year!
2708,"&gt; he didn't ask for total population, he asked for total eligible population."
2709,"You‚Äôre the one who used the word ask, and you were wrong about what he was ‚Äòasking.‚Äô"
2710,I hope it becomes a lifetime ban
2711,"Tell that to the people on my local sub who refer to outdoor anti-lockdown protests as ""super spreader events"""
2712,That was an indoor event.
2713,[here‚Äôs pics from them all inside maskless.
2714,"](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/10/03/us/rose-garden-event-covid.html) the reception was indoor, the other pet of the event was outdoor."
2715,I pity the country you are from.
2716,It‚Äôll take longer for some people to adjust their mindset.
2717,Personally as soon as I was vaccinated I was ready for all restrictions to be dropped.
2718,Really done with masks.
2719,Why has the US not yet banned flights from india?
2720,?
2721,youd be surprised by american tourists in europe then lol
2722,&gt;Meningitis has about a 50% fatality ratio for those who are infected vs the SAR-2 virus that has &lt;1%.
2723,Cause you probably will be sitting in close proximity and/or walking within close proximity to people.
2724,And that would require a mask to limit disease spread.
2725,Not all activities outside are created equal
2726,Oh I am not sure if I am concerned at all.
2727,Just wish that the vaccine rollout was happening quickly everywhere.
2728,This is something I'm thinking about.
2729,"I want to travel to the EU this summer, but is it worth if a lot is still shut down?"
2730,They need vaccines and raw materials to make vaccines !!
2731,Wasn't Oxford/AstraZeneca supposed to go to India in massive amounts??
2732,?
2733,"&gt;Moderna will basically double

Mind you, that's a rather small absolute increase for Europe."
2734,I doubt it'll really pick until after the US is done and starts exporting.
2735,As a Floridian I think we will see a slow decline over the next 2 weeks.
2736,I'd love to see a dramatic decline but we have way too many anti vaxxers for that.
2737,"I said 'most', not 'all'."
2738,It's federal law by executive order.
2739,"Any interstate transportation, you must be masked."
2740,"Another fucking moron of a certain political party, you can be assured."
2741,Don't they require the flu shot too?
2742,My school always required that I sent a copy of my flu shot that year along with my immunization records.
2743,The problem was society must reach herd immunity either through vaccination or through acquired immunity.
2744,"I think the percentage restrictions were dumb and didn't help but unless people were proposing we didn't allow restaurants to open at all inside for entire year, I don't see the point of opening and closing restaurants all year."
2745,Additionally if we *only* shut restaurants and bars (and perhaps gyms and barbers) it feels a bit like the government is picking and choosing which industries get to survive.
2746,I wonder what the colleges have done to increase the safety of the institutions.
2747,Have they improved ventilation?
2748,Added lids to the toilets in the bathrooms?
2749,Retrofitted windows to allow them to open?
2750,Provided testing environments with increased distance between peers?
2751,Is this policy also being enforced on all the staff members?
2752,Probably not.
2753,Are you concerned that services won‚Äôt be opened so there‚Äôs no point traveling to Europe?
2754,Or something else?
2755,Clickbait
2756,Days about 3-10 from the pause were about 75% J&amp;J.
2757,But the last few days have been from demand fully.
2758,"For example, last Sunday reported 32k J&amp;J, today was 21k J&amp;J."
2759,So only 10k of the 400k drop from last week to this week was J&amp;J.
2760,Rest was demand.
2761,"That said, theres people looking and waiting for J&amp;j, so they should help numbers - but demand will still be an issue so who knows how it will all balance out"
2762,Cruise ships will almost certainly require it.
2763,The press of a ship with a COVID outbreak is already so bad for the industry after last spring
2764,That is not true.
2765,Vaccine is free for above 45 and healthcare workers.
2766,"18-45 age group might have to pay some price, depends on state they live in."
2767,"KS at 29.3% [fully vaccinated](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/public-health/states-ranked-by-percentage-of-population-vaccinated-march-15.html), 41.6% with [at least one dose](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/public-health/states-ranked-by-percentage-of-population-who-ve-received-at-least-one-covid-19-shot-april-22.html)."
2768,You think they‚Äôd know by now.
2769,I really think they are just obnoxious assholes.
2770,"It can be maddening, but at least they make themselves easy to spot so I can stay away from them."
2771,Passing someone on the street unmasked is not the same thing as spending hours outdoors in someone‚Äôs enclosed backyard space with a bunch of other guests singing eating drinking etc.
2772,"It's very tough when we hear covid has a 99% survival rate yet at thousands of people die a day and many many more are badly ill, and we can clearly see the carnage it's caused this past year.. That 99% is worth worrying still about but the vaccine at 95% isn't really if that makes sense."

2794,most states do not have a recall system in place.
2795,only states that value direct democracy tend to have a recall system in place
2796,UC and Cal State schools are on the list in the OP...
2797,We are in a similar boat - we'll get our second shot tomorrow and will be done in a few weeks.
2798,"It's a big relief and we can now attend to some neglected essentials, like getting a haircut, going to dentist, etc.."
2799,"But beyond that, life will not change much - we'll keep WFH and avoid seeing people because we are worried about getting asymptomatic covid and infecting our daughter, who is still only an infant."
2800,Basically it's now up for medical doctors with a personal relationship to convince people.
2801,Open it up to kids as well.
2802,"France's population is 60+ million, Alabama's is ~5 million."
2803,If 20% of France's population refuses the vaccine it means 12 million people.
2804,If 20% of Alabama's population refuses it means 1 million people.
2805,Not exactly the same thing.
2806,That's my thought.
2807,Here's hoping!
2808,"EU members are debating if they should take legal action now, the vast majority is in favour but France and Germany want to wait."
2809,It's not really a question of 'if' but of 'when' basically.
2810,If you actually read you would see that the reason for the explosion in cases is mass amounts of people congregating together.
2811,Indians ignored advice from medical professionals and now they're in a wold of shit.
2812,And somehow that's the fault of the US.
2813,I don't recall India (or anyone else) running to aid the US when they were outpacing the world in cases and death.
2814,"The 3,4 is a an estimate I read in several German newspaper - the German Gouvernement is even planing with less:

https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/fileadmin/Dateien/3_Downloads/C/Coronavirus/Impfstoff/Lieferprognosen_verschiedene_Hersteller_2021.pdf

We will know in a couple of weeks, but I think curevac will rather underpromise and overdeliver than the other way around."
2815,I'm sorry but I think it's rediculous to keep living In a bubble despite being fully vaccinated.
2816,I get the concern but the fact that you think we're gonna be able to completely eradicate covid is embarrassingly naive.
2817,We simply have to learn to live with it like we do with countless other viruses.
2818,"I hope you find a way back soon, friend, with a tourist or work visa!"
2819,"Until then, keep safe and I'll be keeping India in my thoughts these coming months and hoping things begin to get better for her sooner rather than later"
2820,Yeah that‚Äôs a rational response to any question of the necessity or masking kids outdoors.
2821,The burden of proof is totally warped now.
2822,"Regarding the current situation in India (mainly lack of oxygen) I feel like we are kind of back to last year with ""better than nothing"" solutions on table."

2843,Why downvote this?
2844,The US out-right ban on inbound travel from the UK is ridiculous at the current time.
2845,Set up non-digital vaccine passports with the same verification strategy as negative COVID tests.
2846,"We are talking about a wearing a mask, what societal cost is there to that?"
2847,As a local in a university town I wholeheartedly agree.
2848,Unvaccinated students coming in from all over the country has the potential to overwhelm our local healthcare system not to mention bring in new variants to the area.
2849,"In a normal year, when the students arrive, the population of our town doubles practically overnight."
2850,Students need to be vaccinated if our area wants to ever be able to return to normal.
2851,Agree.
2852,Below average.
2853,Can't wait to find out if I got the real one or the placebo.

2857,"I can't find good statistics for what percentage of diagnosed covid patients required hospitalization, but hospitals in America were getting overwhelmed when our numbers were 10% that of India's today."
2858,"If their growth rate continues as it is right now, and at least a tenth of a percent of their population is going to need hospitalized, that's over a million patients."
2859,"If they need 0.5% hospitalize, that's a little over 6 million patients."
2860,These are fairly conservative estimates.
2861,India has 0.5 hospital beds per 1000 people according to world bank.
2862,I worry about a potential humanitarian disaster in the next couple of months if they keep going the way they are.
2863,"Then do that, but you have no right to ask me to."
2864,Many times.

2868,"For an ""educated"" person, you sure misuse your ellipses a lot."
2869,"Yes, these are people that also already have passports."
2870,And have had the polio vaccine.
2871,"Wink, wink."
2872,Lots of people have been active outside for the last 13 months.
2873,Proximity determined mask usage.
2874,Sports are a social activity so they are very different than just being active outside.
2875,Kids will have vaccines soon and cases should in theory drop to negligible as we approach herd immunity.
2876,It‚Äôs just a matter of getting there before everyone ditches the masks.

2886,The global vaccination is obviously speeding up as time passes.
2887,"When the first world countries finish with their own (which may be 2-3 months from now), the rest of the countries will start getting more doses."
2888,"So, we should expect a ‚Äúback to normal‚Äù way before that."
2889,Maybe mid 2022 in the worst case scenario.
2890,You know there are multiple people in this thread calling for the same shit those conspiracy theories are about right?

2906,Millions have died and at times we knew precious little about what was or would be happening.

2908,People aren't just going to set it aside.
2909,It seems like a nice idea: happily returning everything to normal.

2970,yea the cdc has done surveys on vaccine hesitancy and certain states will probably be petri dishes for corona for the foreseeable future based on how much hesitancy there is: https://data.cdc.gov/stories/s/Vaccine-Hesitancy-for-COVID-19/cnd2-a6zw
2971,The unknown long term effects of even a minor case is worth wearing a mask in public.
2972,"Having talked to store owners, it's not as rosy as you think."
2973,"The rent has been frozen for months for these store owners, and those subsidies you speak of are far from fulfilling."
2974,"Of course, income from the business has also been less than stellar."
2975,Most store owners I have talked to say they will likely get into trouble once the economy starts running again (if that ever happens) and they have to cough up all the accumulated rent and other bills that have been postponed all this time.
2976,The next wave will then be a wave of bankruptcies.
2977,"We might enjoy open stores for a little while, after which they close again to go permanently out of business."
2978,"They thought they were prepared, because they got cocky after they had ""good"" numbers last year without really doing much."
2979,"Problem is countries tend to assume if this worked before it'll work every time, but India probably just got lucky before and unfortunately that luck looks like it ran out."
2980,Left field?
2981,"Is there a simple breakdown of how many people were enrolled in the Pfizer Clinical trials at each phase (1/2/3), and what their reported adverse affects were?"
2982,NH is dropping all restrictions May 7th!
2983,well pretty sure all the festivals in my interests for this summer were cancelled already (these are big ones with sometimes 60-100k people).
2984,there are some small bar concerts I'm interested in in the fall.
2985,but presumably it's hard to schedule bands when there's a lot of uncertainty.
2986,even one of the tours I wanted to see in October was already delayed until February.
2987,[removed]
2988,Yes
2989,None of the parents want our kids masked during the activity though - we do not feel our children being vaccinated is a prerequisite of letting them get back to normal.
2990,That's ignoring the science.
2991,Like when they said masks would be worse than nothing...
2992,"If they just said ""there is no significant additional protection associated with a vaccinated person wearing a mask, but unvaccinated people would claim to be vaccinated to not wear a mask, so we have to keep it going"" then the argument would have credibility."
2993,"As it is, they are undermining the scientific community with this bullshit."
2994,Stayed home from school.

3009,All of which are safe to consume.
3010,"That being said, I am not aware of any literature that demonstrates that mild acidics (like lemon juice and vinegar) are effective at breaking down the COVID viral envelope."
3011,"With that in mind though, long term consumption of dish detergent is very high risk endeavor."
3012,Complications involving esophageal damage or stomach lining damage are all possible.
3013,Your relative is trading a risk which is so low it is almost unneasureable (COVID from food) for a known risk that is high enough for Poison Control to explicitly state to NOT do it.
3014,"Connecticut announced last week that we are dropping everything except the indoor mask requirement on the 19th, and even that is very close to going as well."
3015,Joe Biden isn't partisan at all.

3018,Also you know people work at theme parks right?
3019,"Like there are offices, break rooms, dressing rooms, cafeterias, kitchens, bathrooms..."
3020,I'm not gonna sugar coat this and I'm definitely not trying to be a dick but at this point if you don't go you may as well never leave your house.
3021,You're fully vaccinated.
3022,This virus is NEVER going away and you need to realize there's always gonna be a risk.

3034,Do some mutual aid and send some poor Indians money.
3035,"There's a large English-speaking population there, so you can probably find them through a Twitter search."
3036,"I'd look for a comparison that seemed remote, but that was higher than the risk of breakthrough infection over the same time period."
3037,A number of things could make the breakthrough rates go up.
3038,"One possible scenario being only like half of people get vaccinated, and society at large relaxes its mask-wearing and distancing standards from where they were the previous four months."
3039,"Under those circumstances, the unvaccinated half of the population could spread so much virus that there could easily be a rise in breakthrough infections for the vaccinated."

3052,"When considering herd immunity, you also need to consider the unvaccinated who have already been infected - they will have a good level of immunity as well."
3053,"Reinfection is still possible, but rare; I just read a study that said those who've been infected are 84% protected from COVID, and 93% protected against symptomatic infection."
3054,"Granted, we should be concerned about risk of reinfection from a variant, but there is likely still some level of protection against them."
3055,"And the US has had 32.8 million official cases (the actual number of cases is likely much higher), the majority of which are from the past 6 months, so there will be some level of immunity among the unvaccinated."
3056,"We definitely need to get much more than 40% vaccinated, but that number is growing daily (I think today it's over 42%, and almost 55% of the eligible population), and still doesn't include shots for kids."
3057,I also expect that once the vaccines get full FDA approval that more adults will get them as well
3058,"Elderly people tend to be more politically conservative and more religious than the general population, and yet over 80% of people 65+ have been vaccinated (at least one dose)."
3059,"That figure is still slowly climbing, too."
3060,Will there be people who refuse the vaccine for religious or political reasons?
3061,Yes.
3062,Will it be 40% of the population?
3063,Absolutely not.

3079,"there's a lot of change, you can go to the store or your job without worrying about getting sick and dying"
3080,Here's the main thing.
3081,The facts have not changed in the last two years.
3082,Just more funded studies.
3083,You have no more chance of catching something from a toilet than you did in 2019.
3084,Take the same reasonable precautions you always have.
3085,Don't snort coke in the stall.
3086,If you are having sex with a stranger in the restroom of a bar use protection.
3087,"Remember the last time someone said to you "" I got a the flu from flushing a public toilet""?"
3088,Yeah.
3089,me neither.
3090,Below is a view of whether states are supply constrained or demand constrained.
3091,"Based on current run rate of doses administered (7-day moving average for each state) and the available supply (doses delivered minus doses administered), I calculate ""days of supply"" as a proxy for likely constraint."
3092,"If there are more than 21 days of supply, I assume that the state is demand constrained: the state is probably not able to effectively use all of its doses."
3093,"If there are between 14 and 21 days of supply, it is unclear whether that state is either demand constrained or supply constrained (or just has bad logistics)."
3094,"if there are less than 14 days of supply, then I assume the state is supply constrained - if they had more doses, they could probably get more shots in arms."
3095,"On a week over week basis, one state moved from ""demand constrained"" to ""supply constrained"" (Hawaii) - indicated below with a double asterisk."
3096,Note that this is a data dump issue.. it is likely still demand constrained but one day of extra shots reported moved it up.
3097,"8 states became demand constrained (noted with an asterisk below): Florida, Nebraska, Washington D.C., Kentucky, New Hampshire, Nevada, Michigan, Ohio."
3098,"As a ""bonus"", the US as a whole has now flipped to demand constrained."
3099,"8 states moved from ""supply constrained"" to ""unclear"": North Dakota, Rhode Island, New York, Iowa, Maryland, Vermont, Virginia, and Utah."
3100,"No states moved from ""Unclear"" to ""Supply Constrained""."
3101,"While there is some potential impact from unused JnJ vaccines in this data, the reality is that the underlying trend is very clear: demand is becoming a limiting factor in more and more states."
3102,"Barring major changes in vaccine demand characteristics, we are likely past the peak of vaccine administration."

[https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2020/06/25/major-incident-u-k-thousands-crowd-beaches-amid-pandemic/3258949001/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2020/06/25/major-incident-u-k-thousands-crowd-beaches-amid-pandemic/3258949001/)

&gt;Three beach towns on England's southern  coast¬†declared¬†a ""major incident"" Thursday after¬†thousands defied  coronavirus social-distancing rules and flocked to the shore¬†on what has  been¬†the hottest day of the year in the United Kingdom so far, with  temperatures in the low 90s."
3136,"&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúWe are absolutely  appalled at the scenes witnessed on¬†our¬†beaches, particularly at  Bournemouth¬†and Sandbanks, in the last 24-48 hours,""¬†Vikki Slade, leader  of the Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council¬†said in a [statement on their website](https://www.bcpcouncil.gov.uk/News/News-Articles/Major-incident-declared-after-services-overstretched-by-thousands-flocking-to-Bournemouth-beaches.aspx)."
3137,"""The  irresponsible behaviour and actions of so¬†many people¬†is¬†just shocking  and our services are stretched to the absolute hilt¬†trying to keep  everyone safe."""
3138,"&gt;  
&gt; The decision¬†to declare a ""major incident,"" as Slade  said,¬†gives¬†additional powers to local authorities and emergency  services to tackle the issue."
3139,"She said they are also ""deploying  additional resources to provide increased patrols in the vicinity to  help tackle any issues of anti-social behavior and other offenses being  committed."""
3140,"Reality - Feb 2021:

[https://uk.news.yahoo.com/not-single-covid-outbreak-linked-crowded-beaches-124027364.html](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/not-single-covid-outbreak-linked-crowded-beaches-124027364.html)

&gt;There has ‚Äúnever‚Äù been a COVID outbreak linked to a crowded beach, a leading government adviser has said."
3141,"&gt;  
&gt;Professor  Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the  University of Edinburgh and an adviser to the government's Scientific  Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), told the Commons science and  technology committee that beaches are not a hotbed for [coronavirus](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/tagged/coronavirus/) transmission."
3142,"&gt;  
&gt;[Beaches packed full of people](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/uk-beach-town-raises-alarm-151106126.html) were a common sight last summer as the UK experienced a heatwave while lockdown restrictions were still in place, [drawing international criticism](https://uk.style.yahoo.com/coronavirus-britain-pandemic-international-press-175737325.html) over an apparent lack of social distancing during the pandemic."
3143,"&gt;  
&gt;However, Woolhouse dismissed any notion that there was an uptick in cases as a result."
3144,"&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúBut, for example, over the summer we were treated to all this on the  television, news, pictures of crowded beaches and there was an outcry  over this."
3145,"&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúThere were no outbreaks linked to crowded beaches."
3146,"There has never been a COVID-19 outbreak linked to a beach ever anywhere  in the world to the best of my knowledge.‚Äù

Not a single outbreak connected to a beach anywhere in the world."
3147,Most of the outdoor transmission is assumed to happen outside because **some** outdoor activity took place.
3148,"[https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/outdoor-transmission-accounts-for-0-1-of-state-s-covid-19-cases-1.4529036](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/outdoor-transmission-accounts-for-0-1-of-state-s-covid-19-cases-1.4529036)

&gt;Just one confirmed case of Covid-19 in every thousand is traced to outdoor transmission, new figures reveal."
3149,"&gt;  
&gt;Of  the 232,164 cases of Covid-19 recorded in the State up to March 24th  this year, 262 were as a result of outdoor transmission, representing  0.1 per cent of the total."
3150,"&gt;  
&gt; The HPSC data, provided in response to a query from The Irish Times, was  based on ‚Äúlocations which are primarily associated with outdoor  activities, ie outdoor sports and construction sites, or outbreaks that  specifically mention in comments that an outdoor location or activity  was involved‚Äù."
3151,"The HSPC said, however, that it ‚Äúcannot determine where  transmission occurred‚Äù."
3152,&gt;If a majority of the 30% of the US's population that claims to be uninterested in the vaccine eventually gets COVID (from contagious strains spreading like wildfire through those communities before herd immunity kicks in there) the country is looking at another million'ish deaths.
3153,Not if you look at the relative risk of covid mortality and vaccine uptake by age groups.
3154,The most vulnerable groups already have high vaccination rates.
3155,Those who claim to be uninterested are mostly people who aren't at high risk of covid-related death.
3156,Masks or vaccines - there is a choice and you're making it.
3157,Good point about Israel - I‚Äôd forgotten that they did that.
3158,And there‚Äôs probably a good portion of their vaccine-hesitant pop that has natural immunity.
3159,"Your second point is not fair, though."
3160,There is simply no way the US could have used this strategy.
3161,We have a MUCH larger pop than Israel and no centralized healthcare system.
3162,"We are giving out vaccines at pharmacies, grocery stores, and sports stadiums - how the heck would they be able to verify if someone already had COVID?"
3163,I go to two hospitals/doctors for different things and they‚Äôre not even allowed to share my medical info with each other.
3164,It‚Äôd be a logistical nightmare.
3165,I‚Äôm sorry the vaccine rollout is slow in Canada but it isn‚Äôt the US‚Äôs fault.
3166,Can you imagine us telling our frontline workers and indigenous population (who have some of the highest covid death rates in the world) that those of them who already had covid can‚Äôt get a vaccine because we‚Äôre giving them to a country that never had as many get sick as they did?
3167,They‚Äôve suffered enough.
3168,Every country has their strengths and weaknesses.
3169,"Y‚Äôall were better at keeping your pop safe during the worst of the pandemic, we‚Äôre better at throwing money at things (except for giving money to our people lol)."
3170,I guess we used all the money we didn‚Äôt get for unemployment benefits and stimulus checks for the vaccines.
3171,Not exactly a ‚Äúwin-win.‚Äù It‚Äôs not our fault Canada didn‚Äôt pay top dollar and pull strings to get more vaccines upfront.
3172,At least people who get covid in Canada don‚Äôt have six figure medical bills.
3173,"Completely agree, and thank you."
3174,We just have to keep focusing on the positives and that we do the best we can!
3175,Hope it gets easier for you.

3182,The amount of shouty rednecky Americans (or at least American-accented people) would disagree
3183,"Not normally one to defend Doug Ford, but how socially distant are a bunch of drunk guys on a golf course going to be?"
3184,Still lower risk than drunk in a basement....I suppose.
3185,"Also, every time I've played golf, it involved copious drinking, but I don't know if that's a fair representation of the sport or not."
3186,"Expert says: If you're safe if

* vaccinated
* keeping distance
* wearing mask

People hear: 

* Now kiss!"
3187,"* Free hugs
* Maybe get vaccinated for winter season"
3188,I‚Äôm glad it went well
3189,There have been hundreds of trials of existing drugs in COVID-19.
3190,Does there need to be a post flaired as ‚Äògood news‚Äô for each one?
3191,"The reason we do research is to see what works, and what doesn‚Äôt... so yes, I think asking ‚Äòwhy should I be excited about this particular drug, instead of, say, hydroxycholorquine, is a complete valid question."
3192,Moderna isn't enforcing vaccine patents in the pandemic.
3193,Everybody can produce it if they want to.
3194,But as you surely know it's isn't easy to just build an mRNA vaccine factory from nothing.
3195,mandatory hotel quarantine once you're at home?
3196,maybe I understand if it's when you arrive abroad.
3197,"but I already live alone and WFH (for now at least), it makes no sense to rack up a hotel bill on my own turf."
3198,Yes close proximity for hours outdoors like at a trump rally?
3199,Yes you can get it.
3200,"fauci has been emphasizing the safety of the outdoors compared to indoors since at least april 2020. as for public policy, at least as far as the cdc goes, they have also recommended masks when outdoors only if you cant social distance and theyve made that recommendation also in april 2020, from what im seeing."
3201,"so yes, public policy fell in line way before now"
3202,What's the consensus on indoor sporting events?
3203,"I'm higher risk, but thankfully vaccinated."
3204,"My favorite team is about to be in the playoffs, which is a rare occurrence."
3205,"The team announced 50% capacity (10,000 fans) and that it *could* go to 100% should we advance."
3206,"I've been to a couple of games this season which were only 20% capacity (4,000 people) and the measures in place aren't being followed, at all."
3207,"Nobody wears masks, people are screaming and spitting, nobody is mobile ordering but rather standing and crowding on the concourse while they eat/drink."
3208,"I know i'm vaccinated, i've been feeling better about being out and living 'normally'."
3209,It's just the still being high risk that's worrying me.
3210,"Idk what i'm asking, I just feel torn."
3211,Anything anyone can say to help me make my decision one way or the other?
3212,"That person is either a troll, or a super ultra paranoid who is impossible to placate."

3215,Visiting Europe as an American is always interesting.
3216,"Some parts have a high amount of American visitors (Amsterdam, Ireland etc) others you will often be the only American in an area (Vienna, Warsaw, Bratislava)."
3217,I am a little concerned.
3218,I had a small gathering at my house on Thursday (I had my second shot already like a couple of days before) and apparently she has a small fever and aches now.
3219,How worried should I be?
3220,Would I have to quarantine at all?
3221,"Not sure exactly what you‚Äôre saying here, but it sounds like you think fully vaccinated people are a danger to the young and unvaccinated?"
3222,You have this backwards.
3223,You have no right to give me a deadly pathogen under any circumstances.
3224,"Just wear a gd mask whenever you're in public, it's not hard."

3226,Are you talking about US citizens in the UK?
3227,because they can come back just fine.
3228,Or Michael Osterholm
3229,I'm vaccinated but am immunocompromised.
3230,There's evidence that the vaccines won't work as well for me.
3231,"I'm fine hanging out with other vaccinated people, but some of my friends are vaccine hesitant, if not downright anti-vax."
3232,"I've tried explaining to them that the purpose of the vaccine is not only about protecting them, but also about protecting *others* (namely me), but this is falling on deaf ears, and all I get back are arguments of their liberty or lack of concern about the virus."
3233,"So now I get to choose between not seeing them or having to continue to wear a mask and socially distance, or rolling the dice and hoping that they are healthy, even though they are going out."
3234,It's really frustrating and upsetting for me.
3235,It works in reverse in FL.

3247,"And if they were treated with antibodies, depending on when they were treated, they might not be eligible to get vaccinated yet."
3248,&gt; Pfizer and Moderna have [80%](https://www.asbmb.org/asbmb-today/science/040421/how-effective-is-the-first-shot-of-the-pfizer-or-m) protection with one dose for at least a few months.
3249,*I highly doubt this protection would just drop off.
3250,"* 

Do you have any evidence for this?"
3251,"Both vaccines were tested with 2 shots, so any claims about the long-term efficacy of 1 shot seem like guesswork."
3252,[deleted]
3253,I bet it‚Äôs not too hard to count excess deaths.
3254,"People are probably still dying from Covid but if your not really registering an excess of mortality relative to baseline, do you really have a problem?"
3255,"Several great studies out of the EU, testing all children."
3256,"The US may not being a good job, but others are."
3257,"We've been the slowest to open schools in the world, so we have less data."
3258,It doesn't help that the federal government keeps giving people reasons to be afraid.
3259,It's almost like they don't really want things to ever be normal again.
3260,I think it means those able to get the second dose have.
3261,I think a lot has to do with scheduling.
3262,My second dose appointment was scheduled when I made my 1st dose appointment.
3263,"I went through Walgreens, so I know not every place is like that, but I'm also not going to not show up when the appointment is made."
3264,"Mass vaccination centers schedule the 2nd dose before you leave, as well."
3265,"I do know, however, some people were waiting for J&amp;J to resume, particularly among the fishing industry, because they don't want to deal with a second dose appointment in MA"
3266,What‚Äôs happening in India is terrible.
3267,They may actually reach herd immunity via infection.
3268,The ihme model has something like 14-15 million people getting infected daily at this point.
3269,It could be higher than that.
3270,"However, like Brazil, it seems like when you let the virus run too hot, it will peak quickly."
3271,Just runs through your population.
3272,Agreed.
3273,"Most likely if you have a breakthrough infection, you'll have cold-like symptoms."
3274,"To me, that's worth the risk to be able to live my life."
3275,Pre covid we put ourselves at risk for catching cold like viruses all the time and never thought twice about it.
3276,"Nope, the 95% was only for severe symptoms because in the initial phase 3 trials they weren't doing weekly testing."
3277,So they had no idea if there were asymptomatic cases or not.
3278,100% agree.
3279,"It affects so little of the overall population, but yes it affects us so much more than most people can imagine."
3280,"Most Americans are overjoyed to be able to hang out with friends and go to restaurants without fear for the first time in over a year, but I'm still hoping and praying every day that I'll see my partner soon and it's taken away from my enjoyment of how well things are in the US."
3281,You cannot blame incompetence of Indian government to contain the virus in their own country on other countries.
3282,The point of getting vaccinated is to reduce your chances of a bad outcome.
3283,Your risk is directly proportional to virus prevalence in your area.
3284,"People who are vaccinated are still dying and having severe infection even if at a lower rate, particularly in areas with very high infection rates."
3285,"Once case numbers are low, this risk will then be near zero."
3286,Everyone can make their own decision based on how they determine risk.
3287,I am fully vaccinated.
3288,I would not go into a grocery store without a mask in India right now.
3289,We changed the risk assessment last year when we decided to shut down everyone's life to flatten the curve.
3290,We have spent the past year making sure the most vulnerable feel comfortable and safe.
3291,"We owe to everybody to let them get the vaccine when the feel comfortable and safe about it, too."
3292,"Pushing people into getting the vaccine when they do not want it, for whatever reason, is exactly the type of overreach the anti-maskers were concerned about when we started requiring masks."
3293,Please don't prove them right.
3294,"I thought the point of the vax wasn't to avoid getting it, but avoid serious illness/death."
3295,"I am waiting until the end of the post-second-shot grace period, then I am back to basketball, softball, games, concerts, etc."
3296,"Mask will be worn when required, but I am done hiding."
3297,[deleted]
3298,"You can only try to flatten the wave, spread out the number of infected so you don't overwhelm the hospitals."
3299,"For what it‚Äôs worth, you can‚Äôt really compare the vaccine efficacy rates like that, due to how differently they were tested:

https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/02/comparing-the-covid-19-vaccines-developed-by-pfizer-moderna-and-johnson-johnson/

&gt;	But comparing the efficacy of those vaccines to the efficacy of Johnson &amp; Johnson‚Äôs is challenging because of differences in the designs of the Phase 3 clinical tests ‚Äî essentially the trials were testing for different outcomes."
3300,Pfizer‚Äôs and Moderna‚Äôs trials both tested for any symptomatic Covid infection.
3301,"Pfizer started counting cases from seven days after receipt of the second dose of vaccine, while Moderna waited until day 14 to start counting cases."
3302,"&gt;	J&amp;J, by contrast, sought to determine whether one dose of its vaccine protected against moderate to severe Covid illness ‚Äî defined as a combination of a positive test and at least one symptom such as shortness of breath, beginning from 14 or 28 days after the single shot."
3303,(The company collected data for both.)

3308,"As a nurse in the UK, I can confidently sat that not a shift goes by where we don't have Indian migrant nurses on our unit."
3309,They have contributed so much to our healthcare system over decades.
3310,I have a feeling that Biden is aiming for July 4th to give a big ‚ÄúMission Accomplished‚Äù speech.
3311,The thing you need to know about big articles about the current condition of Covid is that they are always based about 2 weeks in the past.
3312,Nobody wants 1m square miles of NJ
3313,"If you‚Äôre vaccinated, you‚Äôre protected against severe infection."
3314,"Sure you can still catch it, but the odds are heavily weighed toward it resulting in just a cold at that point."
3315,What‚Äôs the point of getting vaccinated if we can‚Äôt resume our normal lives once we‚Äôre fully protected?
3316,There is effectively 0% risk.
3317,The CDC data shows that the chance of death post vaccination from covid is effectively 0.
3318,"If you‚Äôre not willing to go outside post vaccination, you probably shouldn‚Äôt cross the street, swim in the ocean, fly in a plane, or do any other activity that has a much higher risk of death (despite those activities also being very low risk)."
3319,I feel like this company has such promising tech and they just keep botching the execution.
3320,Yeah I got the first dose of my moderna and am about to get my second.
3321,I've kept the card in case it's needed but it has no bar code it anything on it.
3322,"I personally don't want to participate in any vaccine passport stuff in my local community, Texas."
3323,"However I will keep the card in case I need to travel to another country, for which I will always respect whatever laws or regulations the visiting government imposes."
3324,So the numbers haven't changed?
3325,Idk why I thought all this time if was around 95% for preventing covid infection and bead 100% for illness and death.
3326,Still great either way.
3327,*Science.
3328,Worldometers numbers may be higher but the trends are really the same which is what is important.
3329,Economic impact was more important than the health impact once accounting for all the variables involved.
3330,Texas appears to be doing better than most states despite being fully reopened with no masks.
3331,They have a healthier economy too.
3332,The upside to postponing is covid numbers continue to drop as vaccine numbers continue to climb.
3333,"There has perhaps never been a more worthwhile time in the pandemic to postpone something by a few months - the risk goes down, exponentially, daily."
3334,"Basically the honor system, but because it‚Äôs registered in an app on a phone people will trust it

Don‚Äôt get me wrong - I‚Äôm vaccinated and I did it specifically so I could travel, but when I got that little card in the pharmacy, I thought ‚Äúhmmm."
3335,This isn‚Äôt really good proof‚Äù
3336,"Every country EXCEPT the US is helping the massive crisis in India, which has the worst infection and death rate in the world now."
3337,"When things were better, India helped over 150 countries and sent them the vaccine, masks, PPE etc."
3338,"The US has always been selfish and arrogant - they tried to steal the vaccine earlier when Trump was in power, they refuse to help anyone else, now Biden is refusing to help even though there are extra doses here."
3339,Instead the US is threatening India and calling it a currency manipulator which is an ironic joke considering what it does.
3340,Better to get slow help than none at all.
3341,"Unless you have a better idea that can be accomplished today, I think this deserves praise!"
3342,I go to a small state school.
3343,Our testing site on campus is open 6 days a week and everyone living on campus or attending in person classes is required to test at least once a week.
3344,"My major is part of the fine arts 3D department (sculpture) and our studio space already has good quality vents for air circulation, because some of the materials we use would be unsafe to use without ventilation."
3345,"They also decreased the class size for in person classes, and the majority of our classes are online."
3346,All the same policies are enforced for staff members as well.
3347,I don't know if they will require vaccinations in the future but I'm getting vaccinated anyways.
3348,"Not zero, but there is a huge difference between going to a game where there are 20% infection positivity rates vs going somewhere with 1% infection rates."
3349,The risk is not the same.
3350,This is why many who are getting vaccinated in areas of high prevalence are waiting a bit for numbers to come down.
3351,It's rational.
3352,Not really.
3353,Efficacy after 1 dose of Pfizer after 14 days: 92.6%.
3354,Efficacy &gt;7 days after 2nd dose: 94.8%.
3355,Not a big difference.
3356,"The 2nd shot will help though to increase immunity for a longer time

J&amp;J is only 1 dose, but less efficient than 1 dose of Pfizer."
3357,Im hoping you guys can ramp up quickly.
3358,Canada started very slowly due to supply issues but now we‚Äôre vaccinating 300k+ a day.
3359,Im sure things will look brighter on the vaccine front soon.
3360,No don't tell the lord you're ready!
3361,Hmmm.
3362,Still interested to know how my medical information would make it from H.E.B to the EU‚Äôs eVisa database with all the HIPAA and whatnot
3363,Keep holding the line.
3364,You‚Äôre doing the right thing.
3365,I was in France last summer and masks were required in all indoor places and transport but not much outdoors.
3366,"It was really an almost normal summer, which is why I'd be shocked if this summer (with vaccines!)"
3367,could somehow be worse.
3368,"I think there are a lot of factors at play for young people, other than the fact that they haven‚Äôt been eligible for as long."
3369,"First, the virus is less dangerous to them, so the average 25 year-old feels less of an urgent need to get vaxxed than the average 60 year-old."
3370,"Second, young people tend to have more unpredictable schedules than older people."
3371,They‚Äôre more likely to work inconsistent shifts or have young kids to care for.
3372,"So they can‚Äôt plan two long trips to get vaxxed, especially then their appointments are weeks apart."
3373,They need easy appointments at the pharmacy next door.
3374,"Third, they were told to hold off on getting vaxxed until more vulnerable people have gotten it."
3375,Some people might not realize that there‚Äôs no more vaccine scarcity.
3376,Nice!
3377,"My grandparents lived through WW2 in London, and when it was over, took one look at the state the country was in and bounced to India as soon a work opportunities there presented themselves."
3378,"My uncle was actually born over in Dehli as well, so he'll probably be concerned with what's happening too."
3379,Yep.
3380,Had a friend that went on a golf trip a week after the first dose.
3381,"Caught COVID, was in the ICU for three weeks, then died."
3382,He was 35.
3383,The risk will never be zero no matter what.
3384,"If you‚Äôre vaccinated, you‚Äôre as protected as you can be."
3385,"At that point, move on with your life."
3386,I got the Pfizer second shot and it kicked my ass for 4 days.
3387,It's been one full week now and I still feel this odd form of tired.
3388,"Like, I'm not really tired, but sometimes when I try to do something mildly strenuous after being sedentary it takes my breath away."
3389,Yet I can still go run just fine.
3390,It's like my heart doesn't adapt to quick changes from being sedentary to mobile in the same way it once did.
3391,If I am mobile and stay mobile it is fine.
3392,But baby!
3393,Things were going so well cooommme baaaaccckkkkk!!!
3394,!
3395,Basically the same thing happened evey were in around the world.
3396,September every where cases jumped up and evey where had been opening up other stuff for months.
3397,"If there will be not a better digital system ready by then, it will probably just rely on that vaccination card (which will have to be registered in the app probably)."
3398,It is honestly not a huge problem.
3399,"If some people go all out of their way to fake it if they want to go to Europe, so be it."
3400,It will be a tiny amount and it will probably not influence anything whatsoever.
3401,Not every system can be leak tight.
3402,Guess I‚Äôll hope that my Pfizer puts in some serious work haha
3403,Rhuk apparently
3404,Idk why you got downvoted.
3405,I‚Äôm the same scenario where in a couple weeks I‚Äôm going to get back into the gym again and not worry about risk.
3406,The gym I‚Äôm going to requires masks which isn‚Äôt an issue with me.
3407,Eventually they will lift the mask rule and that will be ok with me too.
3408,Been outside of the english speaking world to long.
3409,My grammer and vocab is turning to shit
3410,81.5 percent today
3411,[removed]
3412,"How many people do you think can afford
 to travel internationally?"
3413,Yeah
3414,"Okay, misread that."
3415,But why are we bothering to convert over to dates?
3416,Just stick with ages.
3417,"Okay, so let's go with your date ranges."
3418,That corresponds to ages of 56 to 75.
3419,50 to 64 have taken a first dose at 60.5%.
3420,65 to 74 at 82.7%  In no world can you average out those numbers and hit 56%.
3421,So what numbers are you looking at?
3422,Please show your work because it's not adding up.
3423,"&gt;They're still trending upward, but not as fast as they were earlier on a month or so ago, they are starting to plateau."
3424,Seems like a pretty solid trend since mid March when they ramped up.
3425,"On mobile now so it's hard to select precise dates, but once I'm on a real computer we can get precise numbers and dates and show that the slow down hasn't been that much."
3426,"No one looks at that trend line and calls it a ""plateau"" or even ""starting to plateau."""
3427,Everyone knows.
3428,I felt like total shit (constant low-level headache and mild fatigue) from about days 9-11 after dose 2.
3429,"It was really weird, then after 48h I was fine."
3430,It's not any different than when we forced the young and healthy to quarantine and take preventive measures to protect the most vulnerable of our society.
3431,"Now that the most vulnerable have access to the vaccine, they do not feel the need to do the same to protect the less young and less healthy."
3432,"We need to emphasize empathy above self-interest, even if we are fully vaccinated."
3433,J&amp;J was only about 70% effective at preventing symptoms.
3434,"We don't really have real-world data on how much it reduces spread, but it's probably less than mRNA."
3435,it is possible that their immune system is better than ours
3436,I think the larger question is how will they verify the vaccines people have already taken in the US.
3437,The only proof I have is a piece of paper.
3438,They are super easy to counterfeit.
3439,Like you could print them out yourself.
3440,I don't like a vaccine passport in theory.
3441,But seriously fuck the people who refuse to get it.
3442,We really need to hit those 70%+ numbers sooner rather than later if we want normal life to return.
3443,"Hard to count unofficial deaths, but the US death count would go even higher as well, since some states were under reporting on purpose."
3444,"And also all of the unaccounted deaths, plus deaths because medical care was overwhelmed/delayed."
3445,I work with a large consulting firm for one of my projects.
3446,Many of their employees are based in India.
3447,A few people on my last planning call had Covid and were still working.
3448,It's complicated here in Canada because of how public health and the federal government have (mis)handled the pandemic since January.
3449,"Long post ahead, but I see lots of things to consider."
3450,I wouldn't be surprised if there's no progress in negotiations between the EU and Canada on the matter until this fall at the earliest.
3451,Canada's achievement of herd immunity through mass vaccination will be affected by the big backlog of older and high(er)-risk people who'll need/demand their second doses this summer and that will displace the queue for vaccinating low(er)-risk young people over the same period.
3452,A related problem is the 16-week gamble used to justify the gross prioritization of first doses now.
3453,NACI has hinted that it'll recommend shorter intervals whenever supply improves but how much will it shorten those intervals?
3454,"Will it shorten them as followed by the USA and Israel (and incidentally approved by Health Canada in the first place) or will it keep going its own way and recommend something shorter than 16 weeks but still longer than what has been found effective in trials and/or ""real-world"" data?"
3455,"If I were to be vaccinated for the first time in early July with Pfizer or Moderna, it's a huge difference to me to get the second shot of the mRNA vaccine right before Civic Holiday (\~ 3-4 weeks later) rather than around Labour Day (\~ 8 weeks later) never mind right before Halloween (\~16 weeks later)."
3456,My best chance to avoid being a hostage to continued politicking over the dosing intervals is to get a shot of Johnson &amp; Johnson this summer (fingers crossed).
3457,"Until that time, we're still stuck on 16 weeks for giving the doses of all two-shot vaccines."
3458,"Would a Canadian vaccinated with both doses of Moderna, Pfizer or AZ be treated the same as a fully-vaccinated non-Canadian whose country didn't choose to be the outlier in mass vaccination?"
3459,"Namely, how would the EU regard Canadians who got their two doses of Moderna, Pfizer or AZ at 16 weeks apart as opposed to people who got theirs at 4, 3-6 or 4-12 weeks apart respectively?"
3460,(these intervals come from the trials and/or empirical observations).
3461,"On a related note, I'd be very surprised if any country were to grant the same level of freedom to incoming visitors who are only half vaccinated."
3462,First doses are good only for reducing the chances of hospitalization and developing severe illness in the short term.
3463,Letting in half vaccinated people would undermine the rationale for allowing entrance to fully vaccinated people and add more public health risk than the EU is willing to stand even when their tourism-dependent members are screaming for business.
3464,"[Since Trudeau has already talked down vaccine passports, how would Canadians then be able to prove their vaccination status?"
3465,"](https://www.immigration.ca/covid-19-vaccine-passports-trudeau-says-no-airlines-say-yes) Unless foreign countries are really OK with a receipt or email that I'd get from public health, I expect to show a standardized certificate of COVID-19 vaccination with the same authority or legitimacy as my passport or multiple-entry visa in my passport."
3466,What about preflight testing?
3467,Would fully vaccinated people be exempted from the requirement to provide a very recent negative result?
3468,"Since the current set of vaccines offers *protective* instead of *sterilizing* immunity, what would happen if you were vaccinated but tested positive anyway before your outbound or homebound flight?"
3469,Are you stuck in Canada and forced to forgo your flight and vacation?
3470,Are you stuck in a foreign country for 10 more days and forced to quarantine at your expense during that time?
3471,It also remains to be seen when Trudeau will drop the hotel quarantine for incoming air passengers (at least for those who are fully/properly vaccinated).
3472,"It'd be great to travel to the EU again when properly and fully vaccinated, but I wouldn't bother to go if I'd still need to quarantine at my expense in a hotel upon returning to Canada."
3473,"That's not true, there is still minimal risk."
3474,High prevalence increases that risk.
3475,"This will likely answer your question:

https://twitter.com/georgehahn/status/1386107418220892162?s=19"
3476,"Ok, my mistake."
3477,He‚Äôs vaccinated.
3478,There is 0 risk no matter where he is in the country.
3479,Well put.
3480,"There is a maximum capacity to both testing &amp; accounting for the dead which can‚Äôt be exceeded, especially during a chaotic crisis."
3481,"In my opinion it‚Äôs already surprising that they are still testing &amp; sharing the numbers, given how overwhelmed and overstretched they are."
3482,It‚Äôs starting to look a lot like a natural disaster.
3483,Thank you for keeping sane and rational while others either exaggerate or downplay the numbers.
3484,But he's talking about total population not total eligible
3485,Terrible job by public health officials.
3486,"Once you are vaccinated, your chance of dying from covid is so low it‚Äôs statistically irrelevant."
3487,Full stop.
3488,Everything will be back to normal by June imo.
3489,Cases and deaths are about to fall off a cliff.
3490,"7,000 breakthrough cases reported from 87 million fully vaccinated people."
3491,"Do what you want, but I'll take those odds."
3492,People tend to oversimplify this crisis.
3493,*Now we got a vaccine and it's over after 55-70% got vaccinated.
3494,"* After all, it's a virus that since it's a pandemic has massive opportunities to mutate and render *some* vaccines useless."
3495,Comparing influenza to Corona is flawed on most levels but there's a reason you need a new and adjusted flu shot every year to stay immune.
3496,Biontech seems to be promising after all.
3497,"There are quite a few cities with rail transit in Africa, but I don't think any of them are proper ""Subways"" in that they're all above ground I think."
3498,There's a difference in breakthrough cases and asymptomatic spread.
3499,"If you are fully vaccinated and have an asymptomatic case, you won't show up as a breakthrough case because you wouldn't be tested."
3500,This is why the CDC still recommends wearing a mask and physically distancing from those who are the most at risk of a severe COVID-19 case.
3501,"Keep in mind, the vaccine reduces your chances of getting COVID-19, the disease causes by SARS-CoV-2."
3502,It doesn't not prevent you from contracting and reproducing the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.
3503,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html
3504,why are their hands always wet!
3505,"Cool, my dad grew up in India in the 60's!"
3506,"This one made me haaaaaappy

https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/public-global-health/550203-eu-official-vaccinated-americans-can-visit-this-summer"
3507,You were always allowed to go out- you didn‚Äôt have to stay inside your home.
3508,But if you leave services open people A lot of people will continue to use them.
3509,"But it‚Äôs obvious the restrict measures led to the plateau, and hopefully lowering of cases"
3510,[removed]
3511,Yes.
3512,All industry specific mandates are being dropped.
3513,"To be  replaced with general safety guidelines that are only recommended, not mandated."
3514,Jesus Christ.
3515,That is a very fast death.
3516,Prepare to be downvoted to hell.
3517,"for as long as covid has been going on, you would think world leaders would be smart enough to stock up on supplies before they get hit hard."
3518,the Oxygen shortage is a big time failure by India's government and the people there have a right to be mad
3519,"So they are requiring vaccination for students who following the science have an extremely low chance of symptoms and death from covid, but not for their employees who are traditionally older and are at a higher risk of illness and death from covid."
3520,What?
3521,Thank you for doing your best to protect your family.
3522,I hope you are all able to stay safe.
3523,Is there a redditor here who might be able to send this guy/gal another bag of rice or some dried/canned food?
3524,"I know you weren't asking for help for yourself specifically, but I don't mind asking on your behalf."
3525,Absolute horseshit
3526,That was just scientists being very cautious about their claims.
3527,"If the COVID vaccines did not protect against infection, that would be a serious outlier."
3528,The data that's coming in now is showing the mRNA vaccines reduce your risk of infection from an exposure by 80-90%.
3529,Which is what nearly every vaccine does.
3530,"You‚Äôre right and, i think it came out around the time that moron started circulating bullshit that vaccines caused autism."
3531,"And at first it was only offered to girls, so there was some debate over whether a boy even needed it."
3532,You‚Äôd go do ‚Äòresearch‚Äô and some site would have people talking about horrible side effects - anecdotal stuff.
3533,"There was so much misinformation, I learned to trust exactly 2 sources - the government health site and my pediatrician and for the first I had to learn how to understand the statistics."
3534,"But a lot of people don‚Äôt know enough about vaccines and immune systems or statistics to make an informed decision and when you come up against their most valuable possession, why choose the ‚Äòsmall risk‚Äô over the ‚Äòno risk‚Äô."
3535,That might change once the vaccines gain full FDA approval.
3536,"Schools, hospitals and government agencies are going to mandate it for employees"
3537,"Pretty high, but the trade off is nice shools and most people have health insurance thanks to a tax mandate and a state insurance program for the under served."
3538,Public transportation could be a bit better.
3539,"Huge medical industry in state, so hospitals tend to be nice, as well."
3540,"You're going to pay your weight in taxes to live anywhere in the northeast, but those taxes come with some tradeoffs people tend to miss when they move away, like the ""construction season"" we all complain about that actually keeps our roads decent."
3541,The drivers are absolutely terrifying tho.
3542,"It's the same stupid shit you see drivers do in the Midwest, but 3 times faster"
3543,"... god damn, that last sentience hit a brick."
3544,Hopefully 70% of adults with one dose by July.
3545,So yeah masks will probably still be a thing.
3546,So far it‚Äôs just been sore arm for me and nothing else.
3547,Fingers crossed.
3548,I don't understand something.
3549,Isn't India like a major powerhouse of generic drug manufacturing?
3550,Couldn't they license the vaccines and start churning out their own?
3551,This is normal.

3556,"Spain, Greece, Italy and France are the only countries which require masks outside."
3557,They'll probably be relaxed as vaccinations become more common.
3558,I'd say they'll still be require indoors in most of Europe for most of the summer until people are fully vaccination.
3559,Most places especially in the tourist areas will be open in June.
3560,There probably will still be some level of restrictions though.
3561,Probably not.
3562,"I‚Äôd probably write it off as a cold or allergies after one negative test when vaccinated, without the loss of taste/smell."
3563,Not until I get th second.
3564,And I'm still gonna rock the mask.
3565,"Just because I can't get it and die, doesn't mean I won't still be pro-mask."
3566,However!
3567,I I'll be able to go back to th gym had which has me happy as hell.
3568,"I agree, permanent lockdown is off the table for many reasons, but there are going to be restrictions like there are now for a long, long time"
3569,Apparently they can't even enforce it for their own employees.
3570,South Dakota had always had a very strong anti mask sentiment.
3571,They still think COVID is a joke.
3572,Eh the colleges requiring vaccines are doing remote learning and social distancing regardless.
3573,So not much of a difference in that sense.
3574,If anything the ones not requiring it are probably going to aim for a normal experience.
3575,I feel the same way.
3576,I‚Äôm on medication that lowers my immunity and they are known to make certain other vaccines less efficient.
3577,Despite being double vaccinated against shingles I‚Äôve gotten it after my second dose of Shingrix so until I see more info about people with my health condition I‚Äôm still going to be somewhat cautious.
3578,I will continue to wear my KF94 masks whenever I can.
3579,I‚Äôll do outdoor dining but only do indoor dining in sufficiently low density and air circulated environments.
3580,Not ready to go to bars yet or sit next to people at the casino like I used to.
3581,"I‚Äôm definitely remaining optimistic and have already pissed off some friends who are like ‚Äúhey I got the first shot and it‚Äôs 60-90% effective and I‚Äôve been hooking up with 2 people a day, can we hang out some time?‚Äù and I‚Äôm tired of having to explain and disclose my health condition as an excuse for why I‚Äôm not just a pathologically anxious freak."

3588,*
3589,"Without the lost of taste and smell, would you still recommend getting tested again ?"
3590,The vaccines turn COVID into either an asymptomatic infection or a cold and we've got the data to prove it.
3591,"I'm fully vaccinated and I don't really want to catch COVID, but there's only so much more I can do about that."
3592,"I still wear a mask in public and in public indoor spaces and I stay away from crowds, but I'm done being a hermit."
3593,Being vaccinated allows me to take more risks and that's what I'm doing.
3594,"Certain people are too afraid of catching COVID to the point where they're letting fear override their rationality; again, catching COVID while being vaccinated is *not* the same as catching COVID while being unvaccinated."
3595,"If you're scared, you can be scared but the data is not on your side."
3596,Being vaccinated makes a huge difference and breakthrough cases ARE RARE.
3597,"Also, if anyone says, 'lOOk at INdia and BRazIL!!"
3598,""", maybe take a look at their vaccination rates before you push that argument."
3599,When does this mess have an end.
3600,Isreal cases were 90% UK variant.
3601,Pfizer still provided just as much protection as the trial data.
3602,Also Isreal had decent amounts of other variants of concern including SA and Brazil and again Pfizer vaccine didnt see any reduction in protection.
3603,Being a hypochondriac during a pandemic probably sticks with you for a while.
3604,What?
3605,"I am vaxxed, masked, distanced and going the distance."
3606,I am not driven by vanity.
3607,I want to end the suffering as quickly as possible and I am willing to do the hard work.
3608,"Honestly, based on the polling done by the CDC, I think we might be able to hit closer to 80% based on hesitancy."
3609,I'm just not sure why demand is dropping in states with lower hesitancy unless the polling is wrong - or people are just lazy?
3610,"Like Wyoming and Mississippi are 30% hesitant, but their population is extremely low."
3611,States with higher populations have hesitancy closer to 10%.

3613,Wow.
3614,"Damn, everything is the fault of the USA."
3615,Ask these questions to a medical professional not reddit
3616,That's the PM-SCAMS fund.
3617,"""Politician Manipulating Susceptible Citizens, Accruing Money Shamelessly"""
3618,Exactly.
3619,Every new person infected is another chance for a new variant to appear that renders the current vaccines ineffective.
3620,In India Center and states have different parties ruling..so lots of internal politics.Health is mainly managed by state governments.
3621,[deleted]
3622,Have there been any studies on the efficacy of cross vaccination?
3623,There was a piece today about how pharmacies are running out of Pfizer for the 2nd dose.
3624,How much protection does FD Pfizer + 2D Moderna give?
3625,India hasn't yet been able to vaccinate all of its health care workers yet.
3626,More vaccine will help preserve the healthcare workforce.
3627,[removed]
3628,I mean I got vaccinated to avoid not getting the sickest I've ever been in my whole life for potentially weeks.
3629,My age group death was never that big of a concern but severe illness and potential year long symptoms was.
3630,"Than Residents of Florida would probably have to fly to a state that allows vaccine passports, and fly to Europe from there"
3631,hehe.
3632,Everybody all aboard the bubonic flea jamboree!
3633,!
3634,Could that be because the US' cases are already so high compared to other countries with similar vaccination levels.
3635,Large events like that are being held in the UK but under an experimental basis and they're all required to be tested before and after.
3636,"I'm 16 days first dose vaccinated and I'm feeling better about myself and all but as much as I want to celebrate I can't help but feel like [this](https://i.imgur.com/Zki6LEk.gif) when it comes to the rest of the world, especially India right now, and I was hoping I could drive up to Canada this summer but that's probably not happening."
3637,Bigger truck up happened one states like MH which have 16.5% positivity rate after a year and below national average testing :(
3638,"The 300 million vaccines for 2021 will probably not mean a lot for the EU, but these vaccines have been bought by the EU, so it can be exported."
3639,"They are also working on a second generation version of this vaccine they are already working on with GSK, which can be used as a second (for J&amp;J) or third booster shot."
3640,So there will still be quite a lot of use for the CureVac doses this year.
3641,"Yeah I really wish I knew the answer, but when a good portion of leaders are actively lying about the virus, things aren't going to get better for a while."
3642,It really is hard to stomach.
3643,Do these same standards and restrictions apply to Chinese citizens?
3644,You mean the **PM-SCAMS** fund?
3645,I think that's the one you mean.
3646,"It stands for *""Prime Minister - Sociopath Conning And Manipulating Society."

Jk I know they wouldnt name it that."
3648,PM-SCAMS actually stands for *Prime Minister's Simple Corruption And Moneymaking Scheme.

3651,Looks related.
3652,Keep trying to order food.
3653,Try other retailers.
3654,You can also leave food for 3 days as virus won‚Äôt survive that long.
3655,Also be careful of aerosols.
3656,ventilation and flushing toilet in apartment.
3657,Wear googles and n95 mask when leaving house.
3658,Wash clothes and shower after returning.

3661,No idea.
3662,I hope they recover though.
3663,As a live to eat person the loss of smell (and taste) is my biggest fear.
3664,"Presumably breakthrough infections would behave similarly or less seriously to infections in unvaccinated individuals where loss of smell and brain fog usually, although not always, resolves on its own."
3665,Does anyone know if the spike proteins generated by our ribosomes after mRNA vaccine administration are capable of binding to the ACE2 receptor?
3666,"The ACE2 receptor seems to be extremely important for overall health, and lower amounts of ACE2 caused by the vaccine-induced spikes binding to them could cause inflammation, especially in the heart which is full of ACE2 receptors."
3667,Over promise and under deliver isn‚Äôt nearly as bad when you promise the impossible but still actually make the rocket stages land and actually make a mass market electric car.
3668,I just got my second jab and in two weeks I'm taking my mom on a little over night trip for mother's day for the tulip festival/a boat ride.
3669,I feel safe with that because its outside and at hotels you're alone anyway.
3670,Really wrestling with dining in though!
3671,I haven't had dinner in a restaurant since before the pandemic and very nervous about getting back to it not knowing who is vaccinated and who isn't.
3672,"i want to live in this america, however every policy decision has to be justified through the economy."

3681,"If we had a lockdown during this wave, what is the evidence that this wave would somehow be different than every other wave?"
3682,A lockdown effecting this wave would actually make this wave standout from every other wave that‚Äôs taken place in the country.

3693,"Floridian here, and I can't believe I'm saying this, but please go to Disneyland instead."
3694,You are seeing the vaccine hesitancy problem that America has.
3695,Most European nations will probably top out around 70% vaccinated while America will get to about 60%
3696,"How is the top level reply not ""incivility"" to people who live there?"
3697,Unless they have an exemption
3698,It depends on the vaccine rollout.
3699,Canada was in much better shape than the US last summer.
3700,Canada is worse than the US per capita right now.
3701,"It's disappointing because they were doing well and severely dropped the ball, too"
3702,Breakthrough infections aren‚Äôt impossible for even the original variant just a lot less likely.
3703,India actually didn't.
3704,And they're seeing the fallout now.
3705,Europe needed to severely step up their own production line for vaccines.
3706,They are more than capable of doing so.
3707,&gt;Time to tell vaccinated people they don't need to mask any more.
3708,"The issue with masks is that unvaccinated bad actors will use that as an excuse not to mask up when they're the ones that should, it's already happening."
3709,"Remember, this is the country that rejected vaccine passports, you know, the things we could use as a get-out-of-masking free card."
3710,"Seriously, I think a lot of people have forgotten this."
3711,"And also ignore that the US does have plans to help other countries, but it's starting with Central America for impoverished nations."
3712,"That, however, is not where the majority of redditors are posting from, so apparently the US is just supposed to abandon them"
3713,ya the US did that...too late lol
3714,"when he said it, he was wrong and lying"
3715,what do u mean the us has enough vaccines

3717,People may talk a big game or follow political movements that talk a big game about ‚Äúnot caring‚Äù or ‚Äúnot being scared‚Äù but that shit is cheap.
3718,Lots of people will protect themselves when given the chance.
3719,"That being said, it‚Äôs sad knowing that there still are 65+ citizens in this country just willfully passing up the vaccine."
3720,The hospitals no doubt are full of thousands of people right now around the country who might die and simply didn‚Äôt take a free vaccine that would have   changed everything for them.

3729,Wow Massachusetts who has the same population as Tennessee is giving more first shots than Tennessee is giving total shots.
3730,I am truly embarrassed at my state and the individuals who live here.
3731,they're fault they didnt quarantine enough....and also they had the vaccine.
3732,Hpv is a terrible example because so many people associated it with being sexually active.
3733,It was more of an issue with people teaching abstinence than the vaccine.
3734,Might get tested again but a bad stuffy nose can impact your sense of smell too.
3735,"Unlike flu, colds have not been totally wiped out this season."
3736,Depends completely on where you live.
3737,Most places in the USA are at the lowest levels they've been in months with more and more people being vaccinated.
3738,My state has over 50% of the adult population having received at least 1 dose of vaccine.
3739,"If you live in India, you're far from being at the tail end of this pandemic."
3740,"The ""tail end"" is going to be a region specific classification depending on how available vaccines are in your area."

&gt;others  
&gt;  
&gt; (namely me), but this is falling on deaf ears, and all I get back are arguments of their liberty or lack of concern about the virus."
3745,The myth that the vaccines don't greatly reduce COVID transmission is more dangerous than people seem to realize.
3746,It's gone the complete other way now though.
3747,Suggesting the slightest amount of caution is instantly downvoted.
3748,Maybe 100% capacity events with no masks or proof of vaccination in areas with high case rates aren't such a great idea for the next couple weeks?
3749,"Look at England which is still trialing large scale events, despite having ten times fewer cases than the US and similar vaccination rates."
3750,I had to do the calculation myself to see if this was true.
3751,You're pretty close!
3752,"But I get 112.9 kg/day at 1 atm and 25C

PV=nRT

(1 atm)(60 L/min)=n(0.0821 L.atm/mol.K)(298.15 K)

n = 2.45 mol/min * 32 g/mol * 1440 min/day = 112896 g/day"
3753,Exactly.
3754,For me it‚Äôs just shy of 11 days.
3755,Can‚Äôt wait.
3756,"I‚Äôm hoping that‚Äôs true - but didn‚Äôt read any of it, of course"
3757,That is so dumb.
3758,We can remove restrictions once herd immunity through vaccination is reached and community spread is drastically reduced.
3759,That guy at the gym wants the benefits of the vaccine without putting in the work to go get the vaccine.
3760,&gt;Hmmm.

3788,I am praying to take my dream Alaskan cruise for my birthday in May 2022.
3789,I think it's a safe gamble though.
3790,Roundtrip cruises leaving from US ports have a weird law they have to follow which requires them to visit at least one foreign port before returning.
3791,So for Alaskan voyages they usually make a stop in Victoria Island.
3792,I think Biden was actually right to put the brakes on the request for so long.
3793,We pretty much have just enough when it comes to lipid nanoparticles for the American vaccine manufacturers.
3794,We‚Äôre keeping just barely above a shortage.
3795,The same for the bags; there‚Äôs actually a global shortage right now.
3796,It‚Äôs actually super ridiculous because America was pretty much one of the very few countries that threw a ton of taxpayer and corporate money at expanding domestic production of all of these raw materials.
3797,The EU waited too long to began ramping up domestic production of raw materials.
3798,Why didn‚Äôt India increase production of raw materials?
3799,I thought we were being greedy and stockpiling ridiculous amounts of materials.
3800,The only country that has a guaranteed massive stockpile is China.
3801,Who offered the materials.
3802,This is completely a geopolitical issue.
3803,The CEO of SII Actually publicly said because America was prioritizing its own vaccine manufacturing they couldn‚Äôt get materials from the US.
3804,He‚Äôs effectively publicly saying America doesn‚Äôt have enough supplies to provide support to both vaccines industries.

3807,Slow moving...yes.
3808,"mRNA vaccines can be fast enough to help, but each dose will only save a tiny fraction of a life even with optimal allocation."
3809,"We talk about sending help, but there is no cure for COVID."
3810,"Oxygen and steroids help a little, but the scale needed is not available to make a dent in India's problem."
3811,No country has enough resources to handle more than a few percent of their own population catching COVID at once; even if the entire world's resources were pooled within the next few days it wouldn't be enough for 500 million people catching the disease within a few weeks.
3812,"Anything we can do may help, but all of it together can only make a small dent in the problem."
3813,You know the local communities around campuses have people that do not live / or are a part of the school.
3814,So you could take covid from the campuses to the local communities.
3815,India?
3816,"Send Bill Gates, amirite?"
3817,In a way this incident has been a waking call for India.

3824,Extreme conditions call for new and innovative methods and it's time for many life saving technologies to become open source.
3825,[removed]
3826,That's a very limited window in time.
3827,You need to compare it against how many infections occurred in unvaccinated people in the same time window.
3828,"Also on this webpage: 

""It is important to note that reported vaccine breakthrough cases will represent an undercount."
3829,This surveillance system is passive and relies on voluntary reporting from state health departments which may not be complete.
3830,"Also, not all real-world breakthrough cases will be identified because of lack of testing."
3831,This is particularly true in instances of asymptomatic or mild illness.
3832,"These surveillance data are a snapshot and help identify patterns and look for signals among vaccine breakthrough cases."""
3833,"It's pretty disingenuous to use this data to convince people that their chances are lower than being struck by lightning, as this is likely a pretty huge undercount."
3834,The trial efficacy data is really the best statistic to rely upon and it's way way higher than your number.
3835,What?
3836,What's the point of vaccination if you are just gonna stay isolated still?
3837,"approx 1-2 million migrant worker left city , this could be 1 reason."
3838,"We knew this almost a year ago, we did not have the vaccine until December."
3839,But liberal media decided to go against the science for political reasons.

3850,I got my degree a little over 10 years ago and all my classes were online.
3851,"It wasn't that terrible, I'm not exactly sure why so many people have such an issue with online classes."

3928,65+ are 7% of our population so our healthcare didn't collapse last time however this time all our population is impacted and our hospitals cannot handle all the population being vulnerable at the same time.

3972,"I think many countries are already writing June off, but with 70% of the adult population vaccinated in July, it should be fairly different."
3973,"Population is young but usual issues like hypertension, diabetes etc are on rise due to more sedentary life style and bad diet."
3974,But people are dying even without underlying conditions.
3975,My cousin's husband died last week with COVID though he recently had no health issues after a health checkup.
3976,he worked as a deputy VP in a large bank and was transferred after promotion but died within couple of weeks after move :-( Even my cousin was infected but she has recovered.
3977,This mutation in India is brutal and with huge population social distancing is not easy.
3978,Plus the government is hesitant about another lockdown considering the economic carnage of last one but they are out of moves with healthcare system broken down and way more people are dying than reported.
3979,I would say at least 10x per day looking at stories.

4013,"Something like this is happening in my family, where a few (vaccinated or partially vaccinated) people are hesitant to commit to attending a high school graduation party in June for a nephew, because it will be indoors in a ballroom and mask wearing probably wont be enforced."
4014,"Some are just not ready for a large gatherings, and there would also be hours-long train rides involved for a couple people."

4034,We're in the same boat.
4035,No friends no restaurants and masks outside always.
4036,Desperately starved for more data.
4037,The Israeli study also found that the general immunosuppressed population still has decent vaccine efficacy but the subset of transplant patients included in that population is not high enough a sample size.

4039,China offered to help and India turned them down.

4044,"I think I‚Äôve mentioned on this sub before, if you got fully vaccinated in January, not a lot changes if your state still has restrictions in place, except breathing a personal sigh of relief and a huge reduction in personal anxiety."

4069,I have read somewhere that asthma does not appear to increase the dangers of covid.
4070,"However, maybe you can also verify this to help with your debilitating fear."
4071,I am not sure how accurate it is what I've read but there are many scenitifc publishing this exact subject to help you make an informed decision.
4072,"I‚Äôd rather feel very sick for a day and be mildly inconvenienced at my place and time of choosing than to risk covid knocking me out for days or weeks, giving me brain fog, nuking my sense of taste and smell, possibly killing relatives, and dealing all of the unknown consequences of covid down the line."
4073,Why would anyone opt for the shitty unknown when you can just get a vaccine and deal with it on your terms when you‚Äôre ready to remove all the doubt and bullshit?
4074,The whole ‚ÄúI‚Äôll chance it‚Äù take is just so fucking dumb.
4075,High flow nasal CPAP is absolutely not recommended when you are short on oxygen.
4076,It uses 20-60L O2 per minute.
4077,Closed circuit ventilation machines used in the OR with CO2 scrub filters can go down to under 0.5L/min

4079,"I say stick with the mask mandates (for indoors, not outdoors) until 5-6 weeks after appointments are widely available in a given county or state."
4080,That‚Äôll be just about now in some places and 6 or so weeks from now in urban California where supply is just catching up to demand.
4081,I think that‚Äôs a perfectly reasonable tipping point where realistically everyone who wants a vaccine will have the chance to get one without leaving their community.
4082,"I‚Äôll probably still wear a mask on public transportation and airplanes and maybe at concerts and clubs, but that‚Äôs a personal choice and shouldn‚Äôt be expected of people."
4083,It's just hard to understand since I would have crawled three miles through broken glass to get mine

4092,"I remember when ""loss of sense of smell or taste"" was first announced as a symptom."
4093,Half the fear was just not knowing anything about the virus' immediate impacts.
4094,"Lol someone maybe confused about the title ,fyi  China Airline is a state-owned company by the Taiwan authority"
4095,Current plan is to have 70% adult population vaccinated by July.
4096,Which is more than likely.
4097,True!
4098,You‚Äôd think an actual Alaskan would be more aware/savvy than to get banned from practically the only airline flying in her state and connecting it to the lower 48.
4099,"I am one of those people, unfortunately."
4100,"As much as I claimed I was ready to go to a movie or travel as soon as I was vaccinated/innoculated, I have not."
4101,The reason?
4102,"I don't feel ready to do so yet, especially if the conditions are still dangerous."
4103,I would rather wait until masks are no longer required to do so again (as I have become increasingly uncomfortable wearing them).
4104,But I will do so (grudgingly) until the CDC recommends me not to.
4105,For that price Mexicans are better off going to the US to get it.
4106,Yeah that's understandable you'd be concerned.
4107,Hopefully this will be temporary.
4108,I can imagine this initial hesitancy is fairly common but may fade as the months go on.

4111,"That‚Äôs *in addition* to raw materials and things like ventilators, PPE, etc."
4112,Please read the article.
4113,How?
4114,"I'm just having a hard time believing that, so could you elaborate on that

India has spread massive disinfo about COVID, did nothing to prepare before the pandemic or during either, and now when the pandemic is at the peak, they started opening."
4115,"In fact, leaders of every party are holding rallies without masks and the fucking Kumbh Mela was allowed

I have an inkling that you are referring to the PPE exports, but still, that's one good, a whole lot of bad."

You shouldn't even bother going out

Stay strong guys"
4141,People being mad that after a year of this that people don't go right back to the things they were doing before is just weird.
4142,O yea.
4143,Actually Wikipedia says Cairo has one of three in Africa.
4144,I was too.
4145,I was told the virus was trumped up by the left to get Biden to win.
4146,"Nope

It's far more likely the testing bottleneck has been reached, similarly to how at the peak of cases in US, it never exceeded 100k."
4147,This is further compounded by the fact that cases and deaths are being undercounted (check funeral activity in India) and that the current govt is incredibly complacent.
4148,"I know this is anecdotal, but my friend showed Covid symptoms and tested that day and got his results in about 2 weeks."
4149,"(We live in Pune, one of the most developed regions, so this is deeply worrying)"
4150,Could this contribute to immunity escape and encourage more variants due to  people not being fully vaccinated?
4151,I'm just ready for restrictions to lighten up already.
4152,I'm in Texas but my city still wants to require face masks I just want them to be voluntary already
4153,"Awesome news, really hope the border between China and Hong Kong opens."
4154,Expats are being vaccinated in Shenzhen with the hope of traveling soon.
4155,Same.

4161,"The cake thing pissed me off at first, but now I just think it's hilarious."
4162,"An ""I'm sorry if I offended you"" cake would be a great gag gift."
4163,Honestly it's even at the point the US can start exporting a portion of their approved vaccines too.
4164,Vaccine administration has been falling in the US even with all states open for all ages now.
4165,The stockpile of distributed but not administered vaccines is now up to 62 million and that figure has been rising for quite some time.
4166,"The US no longer has a supply limitation of vaccines, it's now a matter of how fast States can administer them and people book appointments."
4167,At some point in May the US will need to start exporting vaccines to somewhere
4168,"&gt;since the US can and often does do whatever it likes when it suits them

For example?"
4169,My wife is a teacher and between snow storms and COVID she's only worked 4 full weeks in 2021.
4170,"&gt;I can stay locked away for a year and it not affect me the slightest

I think this really depends more on your personality, rather than being ""neurotypical"" or not."
4171,"I can stay inside for a long time too, even though I have no problems socializing with people."
4172,I just never minded being alone and doing something.
4173,The people who can't do this are just the really social people who love being the center of attention.
4174,"Again, just a personality trait."
4175,What?
4176,Lol
4177,The US is a little under 20% away from matching their first dose numbers and will hit 60% in the next month or so

4209,For my state I don‚Äôt know how they could know for certain 100% if the second shot was actually skipped.

4211,Or some other variation of your name.
4212,It‚Äôs not trackable.
4213,On top of that a lot of people got their first shot through the state and others got their second through other affiliates.

4217,For my state I don‚Äôt know how they could know for certain 100% if the second shot was actually skipped.
4218,One of the solutions for not being able to schedule a second shot if something went wrong is to sign up for a new account with your middle initial.
4219,Or some other variation of your name.
4220,It‚Äôs not trackable.
4221,"Honestly, I think they had to pivot to ‚Äúthe vaccine is to keep you from dying or being hospitalized‚Äù because that was the only want to say all three vaccines are comparable."
4222,"If they talked more about protection from asymptomatic or mild cases, J&amp;J starts to look like a lesser vaccine, which is a problem from a
Public health standpoint."
4223,"That said, the messaging is confusing people anyway."
4224,Who said anything about Canada?
4225,I remember it too
4226,69420
4227,Are they taking vaccines out of people‚Äôs bodies now?
4228,US is already above 40% vaccinated (first dose)
4229,And that it is impossible to avoid getting covid &amp; a massive viral load of covid at that
4230,yeah .. but we didnt do it last time because didnt want to spoil the poor into getting used to free stuff.
4231,literally
4232,yea i was just making a joke about how canada and california share the same abbreviation lol
4233,What city?
4234,Yikes
4235,"Exactly, as soon as 2 weeks hit after my second shot I went back out."
4236,"Naw, dude, see that maple leaf flag?"
4237,It's clearly a reference to our polite northern neighbors up in Vermont.
4238,Nobody is safe until everybody is safe.
4239,"This isn't just about being my brother's keeper, but even in the narrow self interest that is rather common in this sub, new mutants are a threat to everyone."
4240,Most of the world isn't vaccinated.
4241,"You're from the Netherlands which is opening very quickly, but it will probably be until at least July for Ireland, which is at the complete opposite end of the spectrum."
4242,"One vision, one purpose ü¶Ç"
4243,Lots of data showing that a single dose of Pfizer still provides adequate protection.
4244,So even if he is unlucky enough to catch it his chances of hospitalization or death will be significantly lessened.
4245,edit: Same likely applies to Moderna's but we simply have more data on Pfizers at this point.
4246,We didn‚Äôt go to a store for 13 months.
4247,Now that we are vaccinated we have started going into stores and getting takeout from restaurants (not just curbside) wearing masks.
4248,We are also prepared to start seeing vaccinated friends and family.
4249,"Honestly, I‚Äôm worried about when the mask mandates end because I‚Äôm not sure I would continue to go into stores if people could be unmasked."
4250,"Everyone who is saying this is just fearmongering does not realize that beyond the us and a handful of european countries, most of the world does not have access to vaccines."
4251,Stop being self-centered.
4252,Everybody in my family who is above 16 has gotten it.
4253,Everybody but my sister who is pregnant after consulting of her doctor.

4263,I spent last summer making my backyard not suck.
4264,So this spring and summer I'm making my yard a local speakeasy.
4265,Friends and neighbors can chill at a distance while I sling food and drinks.
4266,"Also, everyone's different comfort levels are taken care of."
4267,I can see everyone I want to and not have to leave my house.
4268,Win/win.
4269,Yeah.
4270,It's that sort of thinking that has forced us to struggle with this for over a year instead of a couple of months like the countries that took it seriously.
4271,"Whoa, move over covid, there's a new killer out there, and they spit straight üî• at fools."
4272,"&gt; Opting out, or not bothering?"
4273,Not bothering is one of many reasons people are choosing to opt out of the vaccine.
4274,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Most hesitancy polls I've seen place the people who don't want the vaccine at around 20% 

Latest poll I've seen was from NPR in late March which had about a quarter of people giving hard nos and another 5% on the fence."
4275,We'll have to see where the numbers finally fall.
4276,There's pressure on both sides forcing people to say either yes or no regardless of their feelings.
4277,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt; why would you bother going through the trouble of scheduling and driving  to get vaccinated, and to probably feel very sick for a day, when  you're still going to be told to wear a mask, keep your distance, skip  travel, and so on 

Not spreading it to others who may not be as fortunate as me."
4278,Our country is chock-full of people with co-morbidities.
4279,"Also the fewer people getting infected the fewer chances the virus has in mutating into something more deadly, transmissible, and/or able to avoid current vaccines."
4280,"&gt; The ""Better safe than sorry"" attitude has given the people the  impression that the vaccine doesn't actually solve anything."
4281,So why *should* they bother?
4282,This is pretty dumb reasoning considering many of the things we use aren't fool-proof.
4283,"Why bother with seatbelts and airbags when they don't solve ""anything""."
4284,Why do we use condoms and birth control when they're not 100%?
4285,My oldest (17) daughter caught it just before Christmas.
4286,"Because it was the holidays, we decided not to isolate her in the house."
4287,Instead we just kept a certain distance at all times.
4288,6ft or more.
4289,Neither her younger sister nor any of the parents caught it.
4290,"That's kinda ironic to say considering how badly US dropped the ball

Even with this surge, US has had more cases and more deaths from Covid\\

And India did send us aid when the US outbreak started"

4300,I want her to do things on her terms and have no intention of forcing activities on her.
4301,"My concern is that she is never going to be comfortable doing activities with a lot of people or traveling again, and I don't want that to be her life."
4302,I am worried she's waiting for COVID 0 and I just don't think we're ever going to see that.
4303,100%.
4304,I think I'm okay jumping back in which will be tested this week but I know my mom has a lot of fear still.
4305,She has hardly gone out because of the risks with her severe COPD but she is thankfully vaccinated now.
4306,Today we went out to my cousin's small wedding and only 3 of us were wearing masks.
4307,It took a massive toll on her because of that plus the real lack of distancing.
4308,We left early partly because all of it was causing her oxygen to drop way too low and the portable concentrator wasn't helping get it back up.
4309,Once back home with the at home concentrator she was able to get her levels back but yeah.
4310,Vaccination?
4311,"Apples and oranges, the Pfizer vaccine uses another technology which has more reliable production outcomes."
4312,there's still some question whether state schools can actually mandate it without full FDA approval.
4313,University of California system has said it won't mandate until there is full FDA approval.
4314,Part of emergency use authorization is you have to allow participants the option to decline.
4315,"Private schools, on the other hand, can do what they want -- as long as its not based on discrimination."
4316,"All that said, you can still get around it via religious exception."
4317,I think we'll see a lot of court cases regarding this.
4318,[deleted]
4319,Thanks that‚Äôs really helpful
4320,UC and CSU is like 30 schools...

4327,To be recycled?
4328,Lmao who said that.
4329,They burn it.
4330,In India you need to step out to get the groceries and other essential stuff.
4331,Online deliveries are running out of slots.
4332,Not all the people have cars or any vehicle.
4333,On top of that vaccination centers are crowded.
4334,Vaccines are getting out of stock.
4335,People of are being called to come again which increases the risk of infection.
4336,So there is ample chance of getting infected even if you are working from home in India.
4337,I‚Äôm fully vaccinated and already having anxiety about a wedding we‚Äôre going to in July.
4338,"That study, as well as a fairly new one from Israel about kidney transplant recipients."
4339,There are a lot that is still unknown.
4340,"The study you mentioned I believe only looked at 1 dose, and one kind of response."
4341,Also certain types of medicines seem to effect results more than others too.
4342,"But even still, the result differences of transplant patients vs non transplant is pretty large, albeit not completely inclusive yet."
4343,"Until more studies come out, or until numbers get low enough that it's generally not much of risk, we are playing it safe."
4344,Her own doctors feel this way as well.
4345,"We asked a bunch of questions and the general answer was ""we don't know yet""."
4346,"We then asked what we should do when the mask mandates start be removed, they suggested she still wear a mask, if not until we know the efficiency, to at least when the number of cases drop significantly."

4355,There was never any enforcement of the domestic quarantine
4356,The government is also censoring all voices on social media that are critical of their handling of COVID

4377,I don't believe they drop faster with B.1.1.7.
4378,They have dropped dramatically quickly after vaccination.
4379,"That is to be expected once a tipping point is reached, since every additional vaccination gives compounding effects (vaccinating the first 10% of your population will only reduce reproductive rate by 10%, but the 6th 10% will drop it by 20%, and the 8th 10% by 33%)."
4380,"If this were a thing though (and I don't think we can rule it out), lower mortality wouldn't be an explanation."
4381,"It would still rise and drop just as quickly, just with a larger cases:deaths ratio across the board."
4382,What could be an explanation is a lower serial interval.
4383,4 days comes from a CDC study [here](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/6/20-0357_article).
4384,But if that dropped to 3 days then rise and fall would both just be 33% faster with the same reproductive rates.

4428,There was no wishful thinking.

4430,The trend lines up and down are far shorter and more dramatic then even the Fall surge in America.

4453,I hope we can clear the Emergency Use Authorization phase soon.

4473,We can hope that doctors will be educating and encouraging people too.

4518,I mean sweet but I've come to believe that these records are always because of reporting errors.
4519,Got my second Pfizer dose this morning feels like some one punched me in the arm but I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs over with
4520,The cake was a lie.
4521,I hope everything will get better soon.
4522,For now please focus on keeping safe and keeping the distance.
4523,I mean Yo Yo Ma is really good at exactly one thing too.
4524,He qualifies as a genius.
4525,There‚Äôs plenty of salesmen and con artists that don‚Äôt ever get to become president.
4526,Trump did.
4527,That deserves recognition
4528,"&gt; If it makes you anxious, why go?"
4529,"Out of everything, this kind of helped me."
4530,Because I breathed a sigh of relief reading it.
4531,The appeal of going to games in person is to be with people and celebrate with people and feed off their energy etc.
4532,"But that's not something I want to do right now, that's the opposite of what makes me comfortable."
4533,I'd much rather watch at home with other vaccinated people maybe
4534,Don't talk out of your ass.
4535,"""It's just out of stock"" because your fucking lazy ass didn't go out and check."
4536,And please provide source where the vaccine isn't free outside of private hospitals or else GTFO.
4537,"This is not ‚Äúthe message.‚Äù This is the policy because once you say vaccinated people can do everything in public without masks, it means EVERYBODY will stop wearing masks."
4538,"We have 2 choices:

1) Vaccine passports to differentiate between vaccinated and unvaccinated, and then the unvaccinated have access to things the vaccinated don‚Äôt and don‚Äôt have to wear masks there."
4539,2) People recognize that this is a ‚Äúgroup project.‚Äù We pass or fail as a team.
4540,"And when you don‚Äôt do your part because that alone is not enough to get you a pass, you take the whole team toward a fail."
4541,My husband had (has) this exact condition from his second dose of pfizer.
4542,"He was in the hospital for almost a week, and the only cause they can find (he had a TON of tests) is the vaccine."
4543,"He was fine, had not been sick, no heart conditions, up until he got sick from his second dose."
4544,"As a Seattle area resident, I really miss BC"
4545,"I guess, but we did just go through a hundred-plus year flood that has been somewhat unpredictable."
4546,Why not be a little extra careful to make sure the fire is out?
4547,Masks are so easy to wear (outside of symbolism).
4548,Let the agencies responsible lower restrictions when they are good and ready.
4549,Their [statement](https://www2.calstate.edu/csu-system/news/Pages/CSU-COVID-Vax-Requirement-FDA-Approval.aspx) is that vaccination will be required if one of the vaccines receives FDA clearance.
4550,It‚Äôs an open legal question whether a public university can mandate an EUA product
4551,"I don‚Äôt know what point you are trying to make, especially since many states already don‚Äôt have outdoor mask mandates, or at least strict ones, and things are not exploding right now."
4552,"Last summer cases did not explode, and in fact Covid waned."
4553,"Many studies and experts, including now Fauci, have stated that Covid does not transmit well outdoors."
4554,And I‚Äôm partially Vaccinated.
4555,I got my first Pfizer shot last week and I‚Äôm getting my second on May 9th.
4556,[removed]
4557,why did they send to israel so fast
4558,"If you get COVID when vaccinated, how is the progression of the disease?"
4559,Do people still get issues with tasting food?
4560,Do people still get problems with blood clots and lung damage?
4561,"Thank you lol, all tourists can be dumbasses, not just Americans"
4562,[removed]
4563,"With many hyping up all the variants 

Hard to blame them"
4564,"Looking at the oscars, i‚Äôm wondering if there is no covid there anymore?"
4565,Or it doesn‚Äôt apply to rich celebrities?
4566,"Pedantic comments on the definition of ‚Äúplague‚Äù aside, this is exactly the problem with how a significant portion of the population has decided to deal with the pandemic."
4567,"It‚Äôs not me as an individual, it‚Äôs about us as a population."
4568,"If you don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre likely to have complications with an infection, you should *still go get the shot*, because you might end up infecting someone who will have complications."
4569,"I agree it‚Äôs a silly conclusion of course, but due to the fact that the above is a well known and widely discussed pain point of how certain parts of the world have dealt with this (or not dealt with it), it is in fact a difficult position to understand, at least from an humanities point of view."
4570,Yeah you probably should start drinking.
4571,"I know that might sound like bad advice but unless you feel that you have a high risk of addiction/alcoholism, drinking socially as a young person really doesn‚Äôt have huge consequences."
4572,"It‚Äôs the most popular way to socialize with other people and make friends, and if you really feel isolated and like no one else is doing sober activities, then maybe try cracking a few beers and going with the crowd for a lil while."
4573,"I‚Äôm not vaccine hesitant, but I was never worried about any of those things, and did them regularly."
4574,"The EU has exported more than half the doses it's produced, but not quite at the 90% level."
4575,"If the EU had kept all doses, that would cover about an additional 40 doses per hundred."
4576,Giving a total of 75 doses per hundred or so.
4577,Substantial none the less

4597,It's not going to get any better here.
4598,Our governor is still dragging his feet about letting people walk outside without a mask... when there is no other person in sight.
4599,My guess is people will have to deal with these types of restrictions until a vaccine passport system is implemented.
4600,"an with actual details:

http://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=71069

&gt;During sequencing, the researchers have found a special mutation (N439K) of the SARS-CoV-2 among the patients detected within the past two weeks."
4601,"It is of B1258 lineage, he added."
4602,"&gt;Health authorities have been informed on the matter, Dr Jeewandara said, requesting the general public refrain from undue panic."
4603,"&gt;Although this genetic mutation is highly transmissible and allows the virus to evade monoclonal antibodies, reports have shown that it does not have an impact on vaccine immunity, he explained."
4604,"my cousin is getting married in september and cases in Canada are escalating, being hypochondriac is getting on my nerves but hopefully things will calm down in a few months"
4605,"""Enjoy Your Freedom"""
4606,i think they are concerned about burgeoning variants that the current vaccine may not protect from.
4607,"the mask is a small, easy token of protection against such things when engaged in in groups of unknown vaccination and such."
4608,that we‚Äôre not quite our of the woods yet to throw all caution away
4609,The reasons Pakistanis may be more reluctant for vaccination is a bit deeper than just ‚Äúanti vax‚Äù.
4610,The CIA used NGOs to administer vaccinations to gather dna evidence to confirm the location of osama bin laden.
4611,They are rightfully skeptical
4612,Uncontrolled asthma.
4613,Sure.
4614,Sounds like her kid hasn‚Äôt fit the diagnosis for a few years.
4615,Staying in isolation forever so your kid doesn‚Äôt ever get sick?
4616,"This is probably not about covid, and perhaps instead of downvoting me, we can stop encouraging what sounds like paralyzing anxiety?"
4617,"He also believes ""what is just a few million people, to my billion population"" that is primarily poverty-stricken and seen as less than human in the ""discarded"" cast system."
4618,You shouldn‚Äôt be out of the house at all with symptoms
4619,You have the right to do whatever you want if you're unvaccinated.
4620,"Just not work, travel, socialize, attend any university, or leave your house."
4621,Enjoy
4622,If they just wait for people to die at home you won‚Äôt hear any ambulances.
4623,And yet none of these links you posted confirm the above ‚Äò2024 start of vaccination‚Äô claim.....
4624,I mean almost half the states don't have mask mandates so...
4625,[removed]
4626,Conspiracy theories like.... blood clotting?
4627,The US is #8 on the global ranking of cases/capita.
4628,"If you filter out micronations (&lt;100K inhabitants), the US moves up to #5."
4629,"No, to be truly dismissive you need to say you're sorry *if* they feel that way."
4630,I have a PhD in insincere apologies courtesy of my soon-to-be-ex.
4631,&gt;Denmark and Sweden called each other crazy and irresponsible regarding lockdown policy's.
4632,You can‚Äôt find a single quote where a representative of danish authorities or government criticise Sweden.
4633,Sweden‚Äôs remarkably undiplomatic criticism of neighbouring countries during the pandemic has been completely ignored by official Denmark.
4634,Because the PM of India is a PR genius.
4635,Imposing another lockdown would kill the economy.
4636,"So he puts the onus on state government instead, so he can keep his hands clean."
4637,"State Governments, understandably do not wish to impose lockdowns either, but I think will be eventually forced to."
4638,"Meanwhile the PM will keep holding giant election rallies, not bothering to wear his mask, allowing giant religious festivals, instead of doing his job of governing, propping up the healthcare sector, building infrastructure etc."
4639,And some promotion for vitamin d supplements perhaps.
4640,Why is that so low?
4641,"Even with the endless AZ shortfalls, projections in Sweden put everyone getting two shots at the end of July or very early August."
4642,And everyone getting one dose far before then.
4643,There are probably some elderly people homebound that they need to go door to door to vaccinate.
4644,Mass vaccinations sites will not work for them.
4645,"It says ""Breakfast Any Time"", right?"
4646,"I'll have ""pancakes in the Age of Enlightenment."""
4647,wondering how far ahead of time is best to avoid nsaids prior to vaccine administration.
4648,anyone know?
4649,Meanwhile in Quebec you can get fined if you‚Äôre with a friend outside while not wearing a mask lol
4650,"I truly don't fucking understand why ""The more people that are vaccinated, the quicker this ends"" isn't a good enough fucking reason."
4651,Um...fall ends Dec 21st.
4652,https://i0.wp.com/ikkihibiki.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tenor.gif?resize=633%2C420&amp;ssl=1
4653,I imagine it depends on the gym.
4654,If it's a higher quality one it's most likely bigger and they know it would get pretty gross in there so they have much better ventilation than most places.
4655,Better ventilation = less chance of catching covid.
4656,Although I'd imagine other things play a part such as almost everyone in a gym being active already.

4658,Welcome to Reddit where everything is the USA‚Äôs fault.
4659,Curse you USA for creating that religious holiday in India!
4660,Curse you!!
4661,!
4662,Sad to see such an internet expert having to comment on Reddit rather than exploiting their skills advising Fauci or the POTUS.
4663,Maybe someone should alert Fauci that he should read Reddit to help him figure out what's realistic.
4664,/s
4665,"&gt; Yeah now we have bhakts saying dengue is more serious issue than covid...dafuq...and to blame the second wave on decreased vaccine production is like putting head in sand.. the major major causes of this second wave are BJP rallies in Bengal and super spreader event of khumb Mela

You should be embarrassed at the amount of labels you just throw around."
4666,You have got to be delusional if you think that the reason for the second wave was election rallies in one remote state and the kumbh.
4667,Both were highly irresponsible and the ineptitude and irresponsibility shown by the government is a national shame.
4668,"But to put the reasons for the covid outbreak SOLELY on these two events is equally jingoistic and frankly, embarrassing."
4669,You're the one putting your head in the sand.
4670,I will say it once more.
4671,The ONLY way for India to recover from Covid is to get a majority of the population vaccinated.
4672,"There are way too many people to control, way too many variables and reasons for constant breakouts."
4673,Implementing a total lockdown is just not going to work in a country where hundreds of millions live hand to mouth and literally rely on their daily and weekly wages to survive and be able to afford food.
4674,No other solution is going to work except for mass immunization.
4675,"And absolutely yes, the government needs to stop the ridiculous nonsense it is doing like election rallies or allowing millions to gather for religious events."
4676,And they need to do their job in terms of providing basic healthcare support for the people.
4677,This needs to be done on a war footing.
4678,"And seriously, grow up."
4679,Learn to have constructive debates instead of just resorting to name calling.
4680,[removed]
4681,Better late than never
4682,"The thing about herd immunity is that it kind of assumes that the population is mixing evenly, which it isn‚Äôt."
4683,"If we can get high vaccine uptake in high-risk environments like meat packing plants, college dorms, and densely packed cities, it gets us a lot closer to herd immunity than if we had the same vaccination rates among rural communities."
4684,Plenty of countries had a much higher deaths per capita though including Belgium and the UK
4685,"I assumed when reading that ""eligible"" meant ""eligible for a second dose"" - i.e."
4686,"people who only had their first dose a week ago, or who haven't had a first dose, aren't relevant to this statistic."
4687,"I think there are a lot more that have, they‚Äôre just not on this list."
4688,"I live in a university town in Maryland with 2 medium-sized universities and both of them made the announcement a few days ago, but are not on this list."
4689,"Throughout the pandemic, they have also had online only classes and required staff who did work in the building to show proof of negative tests weekly."
4690,Most of the staff have already been vaccinated and they are requiring all students and staff to be vaccinated by the start of the fall semester.
4691,the small towns and villages are not even registering .. if anything the Financial Times estimate is on the low side
4692,I'm happy to see so many fellow Canadians excited to visit America and vice versa.
4693,There was so much American bashing on Reddit last  year.
4694,And I was sitting there like: I miss going to America
4695,Is it really a whole year since this was worth posting?
4696,[removed]
4697,The cake was cursed...but it came with apology sprinkles....the sprinkles were also cursed
4698,Yep most people are way too lazy or overweight to do the longer trails.

4738,The donations that have been collected with relation to the fund are estimated to be at least $1.27Billion and yet India depends on gestures of charity of other nations.
4739,It needs to asked why this fund hasn‚Äôt been utilised for purchasing more ventilators?
4740,Or providing free vaccine to its citizens?
4741,We still want the freebies and continue misusing the $1.27Billion in charitable donations.

4784,"Masks, sanitizing, other mitigation efforts in place."
4785,Totally safe.
4786,I mean before the pandemic there were roughly 100 million Americans traveling internationally although like half of that was Canada and Mexico.
4787,That's a pretty decent number regardless.
4788,Get fucked.

4792,[removed]
4793,"Genuine question, what happens when the vaccinated people are no longer immune, in 6-9 months (or for however long the vaccines offer protection)."
4794,Do we just see another increase in cases and another lockdown?
4795,Every country in eu is reciving the same number of vaccines per capita.
4796,The reason why they the swedes are vaccinating the 60-69 while we are at about 50% of 70-79 is because we have more elderly people.
4797,Different demographic distributions
4798,"Great softpower job by China in the months before, they know this is a great chance since the US are going into the ""americans first"" route, but the data seems off."
4799,The EU one is either 1+ month old or the EU has exported 0 in the last 6 weeks.
4800,Well being vaccinated doesn't mean you won't ever get it.
4801,It simply means you will have less severe symptoms.
4802,Do you know where I can find data for 1st doses for all the 2-shot ones?
4803,I got my first AZ shot and may not be able to get a second one once I return home for the summer.

4808,"By august we will probably be done, everything will likely be open long before that."

4814,*
4815,"Aka, harder to catch but if you get it it's gonna be worse?"
4816,"&gt;We are giving out vaccines at pharmacies, grocery stores, and sports stadiums - how the heck would they be able to verify if someone already had COVID?"
4817,You guys dont keep track?
4818,Of course vaccine distribution should be more equal but your statement is just not true.
4819,"The EU in itself has 27 member states (that alone is more than a ""handful""), people are being vaccinated on a big scale in the UK, Israel, Chile, Russia, China, Saudi Arabia, etc."
4820,India alone is vaccinating millions of people a day.
4821,More than 1 *billion* vaccine doses have already been administered in the world.
4822,"So, yes, more people should have access to vaccines and people should be less self-centered."
4823,"However, your statement that ""most of the world does not have access to vaccines"" is at least misleading."
4824,I'm sorry that you noticed that I'm totally not sorry.
4825,"That's so crazy, they were so young."
4826,I am so sorry for your loss.
4827,Did they have comorbidities that made them more likely to get so sick?
4828,Cases are going out of control in South Asia and you write this.....
4829,[removed]
4830,I was going off from what it says on ourworldindata.
4831,Although I did also leave Romania and Albania out.
4832,That was before the new variants.
4833,Happy cake day!
4834,!
4835,"&gt;Spain, Greece, Italy and France are the only countries which require masks outside."
4836,"r/ConfidentlyIncorrect

They are required outside here in Czech Republic."
4837,I'd guess many other countries too
4838,Dont listen to him.
4839,He only wants to inject you his 5G chips!!!
4840,/s
4841,&gt;Imagine going to Greece or Spain in the summer and having to wear a mask.
4842,Now imagine you're not a tourist and you actually live in one of these places?
4843,These comments are fucking tone deaf
4844,Will she bill taxpayers for her air taxi expenses now?
4845,She's a graduate of Palin University.
4846,They'll be pissed off when they find out it doesn't work.
4847,How dare we help others for nothing in return.
4848,You're in a database somewhere.
4849,I forgot my card when I got my 2nd dose.
4850,"They just sent me to a different table, checked my ID, and gave me a new card."
4851,It's traceable on the back end somewhere.
4852,"Thank you, we watch a lot of TV from other countries, and we're often surprised at how they look, on ""regular"" TV they're all sand and people with bare feet, but on, for example, Aljazeera, they have vibrant towns and modern shops."
4853,I think there are a lot of places portrayed how they want us to see them.
4854,[removed]
4855,"Not when an authoritarian government is in charge, we know this already."
4856,Look at North Korea...
4857,"It‚Äôs in the Daily Mail, it must be true!"
4858,"Let's wait and see, we have there Michigan to show us and example of what happens when you open too early."
4859,"I am convinced the Germans are planning better that NL, AUS, etc."
4860,Or maybe they do care to not fuck unnecessarily the long term health of a lot of people on the home straight.
4861,"Dialogues have been held for the past 10-12 years with previous govt as well as this one and reforms were introduced on basis of studies and commission formed during that period..those so called farm leaders themselves wanted reforms..and it's not me saying that, there's written and video proofs, search on internet."
4862,"Regarding NRC, do you even know why people were protesting there??"
4863,"After formation of Bangladesh,millions of refugees came into India and settled in Assam which changed state demographics."
4864,Assam accords came into place which fixed the date of Indian citizenship to 1972.
4865,NRC changes that to 2014 which means more migrant influx which would further change demographics.
4866,That's why people were protesting there.
4867,"They just don't want migrants to settle in Assam, that's all."
4868,"Have a knowledge of the thing you are so keen on opposing, otherwise it just makes you look like ignorant and fool"
4869,This post appears to be about vaccines.

4872,*
4873,"dont politicise it .. its a failure of the central disaster management team which should ultimately manage this and has abdicated its responsibity after centralizing powers to manage tests, vaccines, oxygen and ventilators."
4874,its simply a failure of leadership ..deliberate or due to incompetence is the only question
4875,Wrong.
4876,AZ is better after first dose compared to sinovac.
4877,https://www.businessinsider.com/covid-vaccine-one-shot-effectiveness-pfizer-moderna-astrazeneca-vaccines-dose-2021-3
4878,"I spy someone who didn't read the article

From the article:

&gt; The surge in cases has been accompanied by severe shortages of medical oxygen in some areas, with hospitals warning they could run out within hours."
4879,"Indeed I also read they had about 3 different deals within Europe to manufacture substantial amount of doses for 2021, and that also to avoid the same issues AZ got that they were already producing, which allows them to:
1) fine tune the production process before they get the go ahead
2) have already a stock as soon as they are approved."
4880,Way to go CureVac.
4881,I am fully vaccinated but dealing with a great deal of inflammation in my lungs.
4882,I do not have an infection..
4883,I have several autoimmune diagnoses and must take immune suppressing medications.
4884,I am wrestling with the fear of catching any respiratory infection.
4885,Yesterday I ordered online from Wendy's.
4886,I was told that I needed to come inside to pick up my order.
4887,The young worker did not know how to find my online order and was wearing his mask below his nose.
4888,"While he was bobbing and weaving,I left the store."
4889,I really wanted a hamburger with chili.
4890,"So, I went to Food Lion."
4891,I turned down the lane where chili is stocked.
4892,"There were three young male workers with their masks pulled down, blocking me from the chili and  just chatting away."
4893,I left.
4894,I have been on oral steroids for months.
4895,I recently transitioned to oral steroids.
4896,I take other medications that suppress my immune system.
4897,I don't want any of their respiratory microbes!
4898,In Oregon I got mine in a drive thru.
4899,Pull up.
4900,"Fill out paperwork, drive up to the administerer and poke."
4901,Park for 15 mins.
4902,Outta there in 30 mins.
4903,[removed]
4904,I have a request for you I‚Äôm an Indian &amp; the situation is right now worse.
4905,But BBC is making use of some really old photos sometime.
4906,I agree people are dying &amp; nothing we can do about it.
4907,But sometimes  the news channel guys just make it look the situation 100 times worse.
4908,"I am upset with the media right now as no one is looking at the bright anymore all sad &amp; upsetting news, these are upsetting times but we need to look at the brighter side sometimes."
4909,India currently has a recovery rate of more than 80% &amp; also it is increasing day by day.
4910,I strayed from my point but I had to rant it out somewhere :)
4911,&gt; I am curious to see how this will be implemented in the EU.
4912,"I don't know about the rest of EU, but in Poland, once you get vaccinated, you get an easily-forgable piece of paper, but also on the government-run patient's webservice you get a printable confirmation with QR-confirmation, plus in your mobile-citizen app (that has your id, driver's license, prescriptions etc) you get a QR-code confirmation that can be scanned and verified with another app."
4913,"If other EU countries have similar systems, then it's ""just"" a matter of settling on the same standard."
4914,"I hope US keeps track of everyone vaccinated in some database, even if citizens don't get a direct access to it..."
4915,It seems to be a problem of the source.
4916,"There was already a similar post a week ago and the data was the same, and it was already wrong (either out of date or simply just wrong who knows)"
4917,Examples of Danish officials saying ‚Äúcrazy stuff‚Äù about Sweden: ... has not happened.
4918,There doesn‚Äôt seem to be a single quote exemplifying this.
4919,"Examples of Swedish officials saying ‚Äúcrazy stuff‚Äù about Denmark:

- Tegnells frontal attack on the danish measures in March 2020."
4920,"Claiming no science supported the measures, they would therefore have no effect and they were based on political populism."
4921,"- Tegnell in April 2020 claiming the situation in Denmark ‚Äúdoes not look promising‚Äù, despite the curves clearly having peaked around April 1st."
4922,- Sweden‚Äôs minister of Nordic relations accusing Denmarks border control of discriminating against Swedes despite the same rules applying to all countries.
4923,"Half a year later Sweden closes the border to only Denmark and the U.K., with just a few hours warning and almost none of the exceptions Denmark has had in place for swedes."
4924,The border is kept closed for months after the reasons no longer applies.
4925,- The same minister vaguely threatening Denmark that they risk jeopardising the Nordic cooperation for years to come.
4926,"- The same minister repeatedly claiming in spring and early summer 2020 there‚Äôs less new cases in the Swedish border region than in Denmark, when in reality Sk√•ne (Sweden‚Äôs least hit region) passed Copenhagen (Denmark‚Äôs hardest hit region) in late April."
4927,A false claim you still see in the Swedish debate.
4928,- Sweden‚Äôs minister of foreign affairs making all these same accusations as her colleague.
4929,- Sweden‚Äôs minister of foreign affairs lying about receiving numerous letters from worried citizens complaining about Danish tourists in southern Sweden.
4930,"- Sweden‚Äôs minister of foreign affairs claiming, as you reiterated, that there were more B117 in Denmark in December despite Sweden simply not looking for it."
4931,As expected it turned out not to be true within 2-3 weeks.
4932,The border still stayed closed.
4933,- The minister of foreign affairs explaining the closure of the border to Denmark by saying ‚ÄúDanes shouldn‚Äôt be able to go to Sweden and have fun‚Äù.
4934,The biggest problem is the difference between the rich and the poor.
4935,The rich can pretty much get world class healthcare while the poor are left with doctor less covid wards.
4936,"Thank you, I did, I wanted to see the deleted ones."
4937,"I dont doubt that it can occur, but people were spewing out absolutely absurd incidence rates."
4938,"Claims of 10%+ of young healthy people suffering permanent damage from what is - all things considered - a fairly mild disease, should be met with massive skepticism"
4939,Why say this when it's not true?
4940,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7454741/

&gt;Results

&gt;In the eight cities analyzed, all had positive abnormal growth in infection rate."
4941,"In six of the eight cities, infection rate growth was positive and significant."
4942,"Your right, but the EU vaccine passport requirement could have a positive impact on some people."
4943,"Particularly: 

-College students who want to study abroad."
4944,"-European expats living in America who want to visit European families 

The 20% of US seniors who haven't gotten the vaccine yet."
4945,A lot of retired people like to travel.
4946,Not even Gujarat
4947,This is not the perfect calculation.
4948,The amount of oxygen is depending on person to person &amp; the level of covid they have plus not all COVID patients needs oxygen
4949,Hopefully this will even further increase the speed of vaccine production not just for Europe but also for the rest of the world.
4950,[removed]
4951,Wow.
4952,Proud of my state
4953,"I am not sure about this, there are no such reports that this is the amount India needs."
4954,Moreover I feel anything right now is welcoming
4955,"Your comment has been removed because

4962,66%.
4963,Word
4964,Are you serious?
4965,It‚Äôs not hard to schedule a vaccine at all.
4966,"Even if you have little side effects from covid as a younger person, you can still transmit the disease and kill others you absolute dunce."
4967,"Get the vaccine, wear a mask when around others, and we can finally get rid of this disease."
4968,"Then you can go back to being an apathetic, uneducated, unhelpful individual."
4969,Same.
4970,"However, going to the gym for the first time post-vaccination was a little weird."
4971,Planet Fitness requires masks unless you‚Äôre actively working out but I kept mine on even though I was on the treadmill and the gym was pretty empty.
4972,Definitely was a little lightheaded after 30min so the next day I took off the mask once I started and it felt very odd.
4973,And then realizing that being unmasked in public felt weird also made me feel weird.
4974,I got used to it within a week but still am aware when characters on tv are walking around a store or close to each other.
4975,Reminds me of how after 9/11 all planes were grounded for several days.
4976,I didn‚Äôt often notice planes in the sky but after air traffic resumed I was acutely aware when I was outside of any planes overhead.
4977,"Not scared or paranoid that they were crashing, just more aware of them."
4978,It will be interesting to see what unexpected things come when the world finally emerges from this worldwide trauma.
4979,If it had been 60L /min you definitely would‚Äôve felt it.
4980,Most people struggle to tolerate that amount.
4981,If you were connected to the wall and not a hi-flo machine you were likely only on 2-3L.
4982,The wall usually outputs a maximum of 15L /min which you‚Äôd normally only get if you were at risk of imminent death or completely unconscious and not breathing properly.
4983,[deleted]
4984,Let‚Äôs help out who we can
4985,Agreed.
4986,You‚Äôd hope employers allow sick for those with symptoms.
4987,What scares me a bit is the talk about the vaccine likely needing a booster shot in a year or less.
4988,We can't vaccinate the world in a year.
4989,So we may all need boosters before everyone is vaccinated.
4990,"A year ago, I was hoping for normalcy by 2021."
4991,"Now, normalcy by the end of 2021 seems unlikely."
4992,US laws don't apply on foreign soil.
4993,They can just deny you entry and send you on your way back.
4994,But its also really dumb of the governor to do that.
4995,How is the logistics of sending oxygen from abroad working?
4996,It feels like flying in oxygen from other countries is a very resource m/time consuming process
4997,Nowhere did he/she say the average American has that kind of means.
4998,This was a very long way of saying they wont let my non US citizen fiance into the country.
4999,About 40% of the US has a passport.
5000,"Granted not all of those passport people are going to Europe, so let's hypothetically and aggressively bring that number down to only 10% of the US both wants to, and plans to go to Europe."
5001,"10% of the US population is still 32 million people, which is somewhat close to the entire population of Poland."
5002,How will the EU tell if they've been vaccinated?
5003,Did you check the lumen database?
5004,"Any Twitter posts that are not reachable were genuinely anti vax or ""Corona is a hoax""."
5005,"The ones that are reachable are under dispute, probably because the government says the image isn't from where the tweet says it's from."
5006,Then there are a few that are genuinely political criticism
5007,Cool
5008,Why?
5009,"Everything is still under lockdown here and most shit has been shut down or cancelled for summer

If you have any favourite small businesses up here they are probably perma closed and replaced with big corporations"
5010,if i gotta go in person to my job or some other essential function i gotta go in person.
5011,i mean i'd love sick pay but that's the reality we're dealing with here.
5012,May I ask you a question please?
5013,Why aren't they coughing?
5014,Are they just too ill to respond anymore?
5015,":( 

I've been watching the BBC coverage of people in India, the television coverage of UK coronavirus patients was all white hospital rooms and ventilators, but the coverage of India is raw and desperately sad, people dying in the back of cars, but no one is coughing, do they pass through that stage as they get sicker?"
5016,"Thank you if you choose to reply, I know you must be busy."
5017,[removed]
5018,"""I'm sorry you're so over-sensitive"""
5019,"I hope he's recovering physically, mentally and emotionally."
5020,My heart hurts for him and everyone over in India right now.
5021,Lol
5022,Whatever pal.
5023,"I've given you the original takedown notice, instead of using it to verify, you share clickbait sites like BuzzFeed and propaganda threads."
5024,Check the notice for yourself and if you find I'm seeing something that's not there I'm willing to listen.
5025,P. s. This sub is not political and yet this whole post is about politics.
5026,I don't know if the mods are asleep
5027,"I had one of these with a name yesterday, but I swear there's more to it then a chance noticing, I mean, who is called Dinsdale?"
5028,Then suddenly three at once.
5029,Yes
5030,"Well, the obvious reason is that there are still no FDA fully approved covid vaccines, whereas the meningitis vaccine is."
5031,"As someone who is pro-vaccinations, I'm surprised how many people either aren't aware of or just brush off the objective fact that as of today the the covid vaccines are still technically experimental vaccines in that they still don't have complete long term study data and are only authorized by EUA."
5032,I am guessing solid facts hurt your brain.
5033,Because you CAN still catch the virus after being fully vaccinated.
5034,Which part of that does brain fail to Register?
5035,Wasn't the Rose Garden event outdoors and maskless (without social distancing)?
5036,That means the guidance would be to just social distance.
5037,How many will die due to the delay?
5038,:(
5039,What I‚Äôve heard is that the supples were waiting for approval for the Astra Zeneca vaccine by the federal government to be used for vaccinating the country.
5040,"Astra Zeneca didn‚Äôt apply for the approval for a certain reason, so these certain supplies were freed up."
5041,"They‚Äôve begun to be sold to other countries, like Canada and Mexico, and negotiations for selling/ distributing them are in the works."
5042,But really there seems to be A LOT of propaganda out there regarding these particular items.
5043,So I‚Äôm probably wrong.
5044,I‚Äôm not sure why Indians seem to think they have a right to them over the citizens of the US or other countries.
5045,"This is so fkn sad for them, i hope this is short lived"
5046,Indian here.
5047,The reports and statistics you see are wildly underreported.
5048,"I'm seeing forst hand what's happening, it's much much worse than what is being shown."
5049,"3.5 lakh (350,000) is UNDERREPORTED."
5050,Deaths are even more underreported.
5051,"Cremation grounds have no spots left, bodies are being burnt in fields."
5052,Most of he media is a puppet of the government which itself is extremely incompetent (I say all levels).
5053,"It's bad, it's really bad."
5054,And there's the black market.. vaccines are stolen even by their government and sold.
5055,[India vaccine black market](https://www.nyoooz.com/news/pune/1566338/shortages-of-coronavirus-vaccine-promote-black-market/)
5056,"Not sure about a legal argument, but there's certainly an ethical/moral argument to be made for mandating an EUA vaccine while it's technically still ""experimental"" since there hasn't been enough data to complete review for long term risks of the vaccine."
5057,"In other words, it's requiring people to get something that isn't yet proven to be safe long term."
5058,"While the EUA can say the benefits outweigh the risks on the whole, there's no way now to say the benefits outweigh the risk for ALL individuals and subgroups."
5059,"It could also be an issue of precedence where I don't believe any experimental vaccine or therapy has ever been mandated even at a small scale, for good reason."
5060,"That said, every day that passes there's more and more data to support the long term safety, but the longer the FDA dragging the full approval on, the more questions people are going to have as to why they won't approve the vaccines."
5061,Yes.
5062,"May will be our big month, and the peak will probably be in early June when every adult becomes eligible."
5063,We're getting tons of vaccines in May/June.
5064,I bet you don't even have a passport lol
5065,No.

5071,People are still whining about this shit a year later.
5072,He acknowledged it was a mistake.
5073,The science also was conservative at that point because they didn't know.
5074,Trump was also a whining baby because it was a visible symbol of his failure to lead.
5075,The point is eventually it became known that good masks are an important tool in stopping spread for covid.
5076,"It's incredible that people are still whining about this, my 3 year old figured it out in two weeks."
5077,Lol.
5078,"Chill out, quit watching the news and go to work like a grownup."
5079,I don't think the US public at large thinks about this.

5099,I really don't care at this point.
5100,"That kinda sums all of this up, doesn't it."
5101,It causes a minor inconvenience such as an itchy back of the ear and for some (not you) that's more than enough reason to not use it at all.
5102,"It's not surprising at all that those least likely to ""need"" protection from the virus are also those least likely to get the vaccine."
5103,"That's not what I said, but sure go ahead and make up something crazy so you can attack me with it."
5104,Well done!
5105,‚ÄúU.K.

5107,"Yup, you cracked it."

5111,"A 1-in-100,000 chance of the vaccine giving you a disease that is very bad and also quite rare, or a 1-in-100,000 chance of the vaccine giving you a disease that is very bad but not so rare?"
5112,Uhhhhh.
5113,Yes when enough people are vaccinated.

5119,"A 1-in-100,000 chance of the vaccine giving you a disease that is very bad and also quite rare, or a 1-in-100,000 chance of the vaccine giving you a disease that is very bad but not so rare?"
5120,Why is that relevant?
5121,Which would you prefer?
5122,"A 1-in-100,000 chance of the vaccine giving you a disease that is very bad and also quite rare, or a 1-in-100,000 chance of the vaccine giving you a disease that is very bad but not so rare?"
5123,He saying two separate things.
5124,Outside risk is low and if you are vaccinated it is minuscule.
5125,"&gt; At the current vaccination pace  

And here you have your mistake."
5126,The *current vaccination pace* is not the vaccination pace you should calculate with.
5127,Vaccinations are ramping up.
5128,The younger the vaccinated people get and the more doses become available it is getting quicker.
5129,The number of available doses is growing fast.
5130,"Europe can expect to soon have J+J doses available and, from June on, also Curevac."
5131,"ITT entitled Americans, coming as a surprise to noone."
5132,Where did you get this nonsense?
5133,"Indians are not crippled by asthma, etc."
5134,Because there was a shortage.
5135,Saving them for health care workers.
5136,no
5137,Yea.
5138,He thinks wrong.
5139,He shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to have freedom of speech.
5140,Logic.
5141,What will govt do when you go around spreading the virus without wearing masks or sanitizing?
5142,I agree with you and that was my main motivation for getting vaccinated.
5143,"However, the messaging coming from Fauci and public health authorities is still saying that vaccinated people spread the virus and are waiting for ‚Äúmore information‚Äù to confirm that vaccinated people don‚Äôt spread covid as much."
5144,"Now that we‚Äôre at a point where demand is starting to struggle, don‚Äôt you think a public health message that stresses not spreading the virus would help?"
5145,You're talking about Delhi.
5146,Arvind Kejriwal has screwed you over.
5147,"They had it in such good control that they decided to have political rallies and not prepare for an eventual second wave, just to give themselves a challenge."
5148,"New research: A total of 35,691 vaccinated pregnant women were studied, no safety issues were found."
5149,The rate of complications was the same as the normal rate of complications before the Covid pandemic.
5150,"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2104983

I would go for the vaccine, pregnant people have worse outcomes if infected with the virus."
5151,Except early on in the pandemic when he *discouraged* the use of face masks.
5152,I hate this cult of personality thing we do with people.
5153,I think it's based on their own admission that our data on breakthrough cases is unreliable because people with mild or asymptomatic cases generally aren't tested.
5154,"It's in the ""How to interpret this data"" section."
5155,"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/health-departments/breakthrough-cases.html#:~:text=COVID%2D19%20vaccine%20breakthrough%20infections,43%20U.S.%20states%20and%20territories."
5156,Keep in mind that long term COVID effects are possible even after an asymptomatic case.
5157,"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/long-term-effects.html

Also consoder that asymptomatic COVID gives the virus an opportunity to mutate, and in vaccinated people, the mutations are from virus that successfully evaded the vaccine."
5158,This is the phase similar to when you feel better after starting antibiotics but have not finished the full course of medicine.
5159,"We are almost there, and if we stop too early, we can wind up with a COVID strain equivalent to MRSA."
5160,"Hey, of course."
5161,It‚Äôs a good question.
5162,The symptoms the patients experience aren‚Äôt all the same.
5163,That‚Äôs part of what makes this virus so strange and elusive.
5164,Some of them would be violently coughing intermittently or more often‚Äî like coughing attacks.
5165,And then many others wouldn‚Äôt cough at all.
5166,"Or sometimes they would be very febrile, and then we‚Äôd have other patients for 2 weeks straight without a single fever (but they were still sick, not able to keep their oxygen levels up)."
5167,The worst cases we saw time and time again always ended the same though.
5168,Gasping for breath and no amount of oxygen was ever enough.
5169,"We keep increasing it and applying more advanced oxygen delivery devices ‚Äî and they ultimately say ‚Äú*I‚Äôm not getting enough air, I don‚Äôt think the machine is working*‚Äù (and we‚Äôd be giving them 60L of high flow oxygen)."
5170,"Their levels would not maintain, and at that point it gets scary."
5171,We try everything not to put them on a ventilator.
5172,"Ultimately, for a lot of patients, especially older ones, the doctors would have to have difficult conversations with the family :( 

One thing we found that works very well for keeping their oxygen levels up was placing the patients in prone position (lying them on their stomachs)."
5173,I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre doing this in hospitals in the UK and India.
5174,It‚Äôs really incredible how much the prone position helps.
5175,The patients didn‚Äôt always like being on their stomachs but it saved a lot of people from requiring higher levels of oxygen (aka the ventilator).
5176,"If the patient was unable to go prone, then laying on their side was the next best thing."
5177,"Here‚Äôs an article about proning:

https://www.medline.com/coronavirus/prone-positioning-benefits-covid-19-patient/

November-January was straight hell for us in Los Angeles."
5178,We had a refrigerator truck outside our emergency room stacked with bodies each day.
5179,Covid and complications from covid.
5180,It felt like it would never end.
5181,I‚Äôll say as soon as we gained a foothold in mass vaccinating the elderly (beginning in January) ‚Äî around February is when we saw the caseload drop in our ICUs.
5182,I really feel for India right now (and Brazil and any parts of the world that are going through it bad).
5183,"We struggled so much with supplies, I shudder to think how others are managing."
5184,It all depends where you live.
5185,Chance of Covid is basically zero in Australia and New Zealand right now.
5186,I am more optimistic.
5187,The mrna vaccines are a straight up miricle of modern science and so far there is very little evidence saying that protection will drop off.
5188,That said I would get a booster every month if it ment I can go back to my preoandemic life
5189,"""At cost"" would cover... the costs."
5190,Including the extra ones.
5191,"Complete agree, I was trying to say something like this in my previous post but you said it better than I did."
5192,He won't be as powerful as he is now.
5193,That‚Äôs how you stop a fucking pandemic.
5194,Now?
5195,Why not 6 monthd back?
5196,Stop defending mass murderers
5197,I'm in Hong Kong where a lot of people don't wear masks outside.
5198,"We have zero cases today, typically somewhere between 0 - 2 cases a day."
5199,"No lockdowns, packed restaurants and shops."
5200,It makes me wonder what the hell is going on in the West.
5201,"Yeah, just don't take AZ into account."
5202,"If they come, it's a bonus."
5203,I'll do my rain dance to help their deliveries.
5204,It is exactly as efficient as their management.
5205,Yes.
5206,There it appears there will be a reciprocal deal between the US and EU.
5207,People should start using more balanced news outlets than BBC.
5208,Though they are right for once since they look better.
5209,....do you have any idea the amount of money Fauci is going to make once he reenters the private sector?
5210,"I mean, you can decide you don‚Äôt want to ‚Äúchance it‚Äù based on your circumstances but others it‚Äôs not the same."
5211,They don‚Äôt see it as the same risk.
5212,I‚Äôve known a decent # of people who got covid and their experiences varied to the point if that‚Äôs all I saw I might not think it horrid to ‚Äúrisk it‚Äù over an unapproved vaccine.
5213,I got my Pfizer and will get second next week but I can‚Äôt blame anyone who is hesitant until it‚Äôs approved.
5214,We don‚Äôt know much more about any possible effects from vaccine than we do about ‚Äúlong covid‚Äù.
5215,But if it is from a point of all vac bad yeah it‚Äôs dumb but this particular case I can understand.
5216,I just find it hard to believe that Tailands government are a bunch if science deniers.
5217,Kinda disturbing.
5218,Is there a point to sending ventilators when they don't have any oxygen for them?
5219,"You said this a few hours ago:

&gt; Majority of Republicans are racist psychopaths."
5220,So I'm not surprised you're pretending BLM protests didn't spread the virus.
5221,"Please come back to reality, it's actually pretty nice here."
5222,Time for Seppuku.
5223,/s
5224,Not for both sides.
5225,The minorities left over on Pakistan's side have had it way worse than imagination.
5226,Meanwhile in Australia... :(
5227,We insist you still do.
5228,"We run on electricity, tea and bantz."
5229,It's still possible to catch an asymptomatic to mild case of Covid with the J&amp;J vaccine.
5230,It keeps you out of the hospital/from severe infection - but doesn't fully prevent infection.
5231,This is less than peanuts.
5232,UK should just return all the resources and manpower it looted for over 2 centuries to develop itself from India instead.
5233,This is really stupid.
5234,"There's all those mutant strains happening, and the US hasn't even ban travel to India yet."
5235,Ron Johnson needs to be censured for his dangerous ideas.
5236,Stop the fear mongering.
5237,If you are fully vaccinated what would be the risk for outdoor activities?
5238,Fauci clearly is taking a cautious stance in his statement *like he always does*.
5239,But that doesn‚Äôt change what he actually said into what you wanted him to say.
5240,We already know from the data that almost no one gets the virus outdoors.
5241,I don't understand why they continue pretending otherwise.
5242,It's almost as if they desperately don't want to give up the power they've been given.
5243,"Yes, but the vaccination speed will only increase now."
5244,People keep making the mistake thinking that the increase is constant rather than exponential.
5245,"This is exactly what a girl in her early 30s told me recently- I get the vaccine, can still get/pass the virus, have to continue to socially distance, and still have to wear a mask??"
5246,What's the point!
5247,(Massachusetts here).
5248,You know it.
5249,Probably saying it wasn't safe for to travel with the public.
5250,Mom got it at her office and transmitted it to me at home.
5251,You would riot.

5255,That's not how science works
5256,Please do!
5257,I really want to visit Vancouver again!
5258,We kinda knew that since there are no traced or reported cases of transmissions outside since it all began
5259,The press runs with WHO recommendations.
5260,"Not by much, and the EU has 40% more people."
5261,Thankyou so much UK.
5262,Really appreciate the help!
5263,!
5264,Idk.
5265,Indian festivals does not work on Roman calendar.
5266,Oh for crying out loud.
5267,Are we ever be allowed to to do anything without a mask anymore?
5268,Brilliant news!
5269,I really hope things can stabilize in Europe in the next few months and we can get on with helping the rest of the world through this.
5270,Still racist.
5271,What country wouldn't put it's citizens first?
5272,India had the opportunity to procure doses of Pfizer/Moderna and they turned it down in favor of domestically produced vaccines.
5273,The Indian government is doing everything to shift blame for their own incompetence on to anyone else.
5274,Do not make statements with no evidence.
5275,"Well, now she was fired on the spot."
5276,Because this is on many levels not acceptable.
5277,Apparently hypocrisy is completely fine for people.
5278,How come I knew that a year ago
5279,It took a global pandemic for them to phase out fax.
5280,Anything is possible.
5281,"If Amsterdam didn't want people peeing in the streets, why did they have open latrines in the middle of so many of them?"
5282,With kids people are making their own choices.
5283,Some are keeping their kids home until vaccination.
5284,Some just got back from Disney.
5285,This isn‚Äôt going to change until we have a pediatric version of the vaccine.
5286,I‚Äôm personally masking in public just to be consistent with the kids and set an example.
5287,Sports also got axed this spring.
5288,We‚Äôre all going to have to muddle through until they release the kids vaccine.
5289,"From what I heard, you guys never stopped."

5408,"How do they expect herd immunity to happen, with magic?"
5409,"Herd immunity comes from the reduced transmission of COVID and we know the vaccines help reduce transmission heavily on both individual and mass scales, but some people want to pretend otherwise while still wanting people to be vaccinated."
5410,You can't say more people need to be vaccinated while saying more people being vaccinated changes nothing.

5449,"I know I'm not alone when I say that I want to see a full cost/benefit analysis of all anti-COVID measures once this is over, and I'm sure governments and organizations around the world are tabulating these in real time."
5450,"In hindsight, it may very well turn out that some types of lockdowns in some areas were more effective than harmful while other types of lockdowns in other areas did more harm than good."
5451,"However, as the situation has developed or the past year, the general idea of lockdowns is sound and based on our modern understanding of public health."
5452,"Perhaps there is the argument that halfway measures are worse than either a fully draconian approach (China) or nothing at all, and maybe that's what the evidence will point towards in the future, but as it stands, I think what we have is better than nothing at all."
5453,Which is why even through covid I had to push to get them seen in person.

5457,"So like 95% against serious symptoms, 80% reduction in all cases, etc."
5458,I've been fully vaccinated for nearly 2 months now and I just ate in a restaurant for the first time yesterday.
5459,And I've only had my mask off around non-family one other time when I had to go to the dentist last week.
5460,I kept putting my mask back on anytime I didn't need to have it off at the dentists and at the restaurant.
5461,It's definitely gonna take some time for me to feel comfortable doing normal things again.
5462,We haven't *known* this.
5463,We've suspected it.
5464,Now we know.
5465,So now we make revisions to guidelines.
5466,"I'm sure that is the idea, but again, that could happen with any disease - we actually have had it happen 3 times with influenza in the last ~100 years."
5467,"So unless they've always been worried about that and stay home because the vaccine uptake rate for influenza is way lower, then this is an inconsistent and incoherent position."
5468,Diseases can and do mutate.
5469,"That's not new, and it's not going away if we vaccinate 70% or whatever."
5470,Treating this particular virus like the only one that might do so in a scary way is bizarre.
5471,"How priviledged are we, that we get to choose WHICH vaccine to get?"
5472,"I got J&amp;J, and I'm thrilled about it."
5473,"I'm in the age range with the higher risk for the clots, but 6 weeks later and I'm doing just fine."
5474,"In about 2 more weeks, I'm looking at efficacy in the 90% range."
5475,Any vaccine is better than 0 vaccine.
5476,Science rules.
5477,"Looking at how the mRNA vaccines have stood up to the variants, it's a no-brainer."
5478,Of course you should pick an mRNA vaccine.
5479,J&amp;J is good for hard-to-reach populations that will balk at getting a second dose though.

5492,Some of you talk as if it is literally a waste of time without meaning to.
5493,Lol
5494,I would disagree with how you've interpreted what he's saying.

5514,The glass vials are also an issue.

5516,"At least for a while yet, lab glassware and plasticware is so hard to get right now."

5527,"The ""political reasons"" you're talking about are the end of the survivability of our planet caused by generations of greed."
5528,"Whether or not you agree, the total collapse of our future is a pretty solid reason to be pissed at older generations."
5529,I can't blame them for lashing out.
5530,Most young if not all young people I know are deciding never to have children because they do not want to put any child through what's coming in the next two decades.
5531,"BTW, if you're a millennial or older generation, you may not understand just how widespread the understanding is among the young that the future is dead."
5532,"Millennials and older have had the luxury of pushing out the thought of climate change into the far future, it might even still feel like climate change *is* still in the far future."

5546,How big is the chance that we have to ‚Äúvaccine for life‚Äù and how bad is that?
5547,Perhaps a better question: how long will we need to be vaccinated?
5548,I ask because Pfizer already mentions that it‚Äôs inevitable that we will need a 3th shot
5549,"You might want to check your math there, bud."
5550,personal preference.
5551,"I wear KN95 still, just because it's what I have, and it's the kind that has straps that go around the neck and on top of the head, and it's actually made well enough to not cause my glasses to fog."
5552,"Also I hate ear loop masks, they hurt way worse for me."
5553,"If I could find a cloth mask that has the head/neck straps as opposed to ear loops, and good enough sealing around the nose to not fog my glasses, I'd ditch the kn95."
5554,Lol well I'm not going to fly to New Hampshire just to get a vaccine.

5557,So I'm in a waiting list instead :/
5558,I didn't say it didn't mean anything.

5560,Proof is not the standard.
5561,Once it's off EUA his or her employer will probably require it which is even funnier.
5562,"Likely in the next year

Also, I'm assuming they don't travel?"
5563,Vaccines are going to be required to travel in a few months Europe already announced they will require it.
5564,Of course the tin foil hat crew usually can't even afford a passport so there's that.
5565,But the vast majority of people aren't the types of people who were pumping those death numbers.
5566,"I'm not saying it isn't tragic or that we should have had any restrictions, but if you are young and relatively healthy it is incredibly irrational to fear for your life because of this."

5570,She had surgery and chemo for stage 4 cancer last year.
5571,"When colleges are requiring vaccines to return to campus but still telling students they need to wear a mask and keep their distance, only absolute idiots would be confused about why young Americans don't have much interest in the vaccine."
5572,"The messaging has been ""This does not work and this does not help"" for months now."
5573,How in God's name did anyone expect people who aren't at risk to get vaccinated when they're told that it won't change anything for them whatsoever?
5574,I had to go no contact with my dad last year.

5604,"There's no need to keep the numbers up, because it only benefits them if the demand on the system is lower."
5605,But a crapload of covid patients is definitely the opposite of that.
5606,Just facts.
5607,"&gt;countries like Brazil

I've had this argument with family in Brazil, not worth it."
5608,"Basically covid numbers according to them are exaggerated because doctors and states get paid for those, they'll put car accident victims as covid, according to them, which I know is bullshit."
5609,"Also they have gone back and changed 2019 deaths to covid, according to them."
5610,And all those mass grave site pictures in Manaus?
5611,"All fake, empty caskets they say."
5612,I'll use cdc data with them and say maybe Brazil is corrupt but the cdc isn't.
5613,They don't care.
5614,Same family was super worried while one of them was in the icu with covid and then went back to saying it isn't a big deal and that catching covid was a blessing so they don't have to get vaccinated.
5615,Yeah I remember reading that the obituary section in some city - maybe Boston?
5616,Was like 15 pages.
5617,So I went to my hometown newspaper and checked and sure enough it was several times longer than the same period the year before or the year before that.
5618,"People can say what they want, there's no reasonable explanation for that other than the obvious - it's a fucking pandemic."
5619,"Every health organization and agency on the planet acknowledges it, so I really don't get where any layperson who doesn't know a virus from a bacterium gets the brass balls it takes to play armchair expert."
5620,It's honestly pathetic to see.

5629,There's a narrative going around that hospitals somehow make more money when someone dies of Covid so local hospitals are attributing non-covid deaths to covid.

5631,What was the lie about herd immunity?

5633,I'm not surprised they're doing ok with masks.
5634,The contract says the EU can't sue them.
5635,The fact that the EU has sued them means that the contract is already null and void.
5636,Well J&amp;J technology is not really that more proven.
5637,"AFAIK it's proven in animals but the only other viral vector vaccine for human use is the  rVSV-ZEBOV ebola vaccine, which uses a different kind of virus compared to all the covid vaccines and was approved in 2019."

5656,Implementation on a   wide scale was granted emergency fast tracking.
5657,Two completely different concepts.
5658,Yeah but you dont HAVE to get the coronavirus...
5659,It's a little mind blowing to me that the hardest part of making these vaccines is getting vials filled and not producing the actual mRNA.
5660,I need to get a covid test to go back home to Canada and they require a negative covid test.
5661,"Their rule is that it has to be a PCR test, not an antigen test."

5668,"It's almost like nothing is 100% and we're always ""experimenting"""
5669,Inactivated vaccines are a lot harder to make at scale.
5670,And they don't use the same supply chain or research as mRNA at all.
5671,"And they're more dangerous,  not safer."
5672,It is a little weird that US companies have only made the 4 vaccines though; you'd think other companies would have invested in different technologies and it would have paid off had they done so.
5673,Asymptomatic is the problem.
5674,Please stop you‚Äôre actually pathetic
5675,"It‚Äôs not a white lie, masks wasn‚Äôt a white lie."
5676,65% isn‚Äôt herd immunity.
5677,We have no idea how long or how strong natural immunity is.
5678,"We have no idea how long or strong the vaccine protects, we‚Äôre learning as we go."
5679,"If we‚Äôre adults just tell us the science actually worked, we won‚Äôt be having this conversation because the science is herd immunity and that‚Äôs north of 90%."
5680,"So hold what we got till then, we‚Äôre approaching 45% of adults."
5681,It‚Äôs getting there.
5682,"With masks, I don‚Äôt know how it got missed but Fauci was honest about that."
5683,They said don‚Äôt because 350 million orders for cases of N95s would have obliterated the supply chain that was already broken.
5684,"So they said it not a thing until the chain got healthy and then brought masks on line for the public, it was about getting health care workers masks."
5685,"The mRNA vaccines appear to be pretty much harmless, so I'm not really sure how you'd get much safer than that."
5686,"The inactivated virus vaccines have much lower efficacy, too."
5687,It all depends on your body's reaction to the vaccine.
5688,Also the vaccine is not a shield from infection but more like a professional coach teaching your body what to do.
5689,"It's not really breaking through a wall, but more like seeing if your body studied correctly and can build the correct response to invaders."
5690,"In the end, it'll help reduce the severity of the disease (and therefore reducing your chances of permanent anything.)"
5691,Ron is dumb in person too.
5692,He's also pretend dumb like you mentioned.
5693,I just know because I've worked with him in person and the dude is an idiot.
5694,I have a 10 month old daughter.
5695,Once my husband and I are fully vaccinated (next week) we will be largely going back to normal.
5696,I wouldn't take her to an indoor packed bar full of unmasked people (not that I would do that anyway) but we'll start seeing small groups inside again this summer and plan to go to an outdoor wedding.

5719,"The FDA did what they're supposed to do, the vaccines are all unapproved and the pause was to investigate a possible issue."
5720,Honestly the pause should give people more faith in the FDA and JJ rather than less.
5721,Unfortunately the nuance of the truth can't stand to the idiocy of the headline.
5722,That‚Äôs FDA approval.

5730,"A person might not develop antibodies, everyone is worried about variants being just different enough, etc...

Best to keep wearing a mask until the situation is under control wherever you live."
5731,Once we have low numbers and we get most people vaccinated this won't be as much of a concern.
5732,[removed]
5733,Back then the scientific thinking was that covid is transmitted by contact (to the nose and eyes).
5734,"So wearing a mask would have ONLY ACCELERATED THE SPREAD OF COVID

But when the statistically data showed that masks work he (and the CDC) accepted the evidence and make appropriate corrections to recommendations."
5735,Why is this suddenly considered mysterious?
5736,Scientists are supposed to interpret data and draw conclusions from what it says.
5737,"Those are vectored,  not inactivated."
5738,"Link to the original research mentioned in this article: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2104983

5753,That is so maddening.
5754,I worked in probate at the start of this and we had doctors calling to change death certificates because they realized COVID had killed our wards and NOT pneumonia/breathing complications like originally reported.
5755,I imagine the number of COVID deaths to be MUCH higher than reported given how Florida and Texas don't accurately report things.

Step away from the cnn buddy."
5758,"IT IS ABSOLUTELY AN EXPERIMENTAL VACCINE 


Vaccines that receive EUA are considered experimental until the FDA formally approves it."

5760,So if the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù 2020 number would have been say 2.875 million.
5761,"That puts us a little shy of 480k for 2020 excess deaths, right?"
5762,Doesn‚Äôt feel that far off from where official COVID numbers will land (most of the Jan ‚Äúreported‚Äù deaths will have death certificates in 2020 due to lags)
5763,"CDC: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/eua/index.html

Vaccines are approved for emergency use, not via the normal FDA approval process (this is a good thing as this means we skip the normal bureaucracy)."

5765,"You're assuming I'm making some kind of judgment, where I'm only stating objective facts."
5766,I‚Äôm very used to masks in general I just struggled with feeling a little lightheaded after being on the treadmill for a while with the mask.

5774, a car leaving a vaccine site near me got tboned and the 2 people that just got vaccinated died.

5787,"The problem though is vaccines ares a longer term solution and India is in crisis NOW, the ship has sailed for a vaccine based strategy for this wave at least."

""While both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are more than 90% effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19, we still don't know whether they prevent you from spreading the virus to other people."""
5812,"Nobody is saying it doesn't happen, just that it's rare and not the reason 50% of young people are deciding not to get vaccinated."
5813,Florida is a completely different planet between the north and south.
5814,This article seems to be focusing at the local level.
5815,"Yep, my social media feed was filled with excited posts about scheduling their vaccine appointment."
5816,I'm 33 and most of my friends are around that age.
5817,We are THRILLED to take the vaccine.
5818,"This poll was of 18-35 year olds, I bet if you broke down the numbers further, the actual millennials would be less likely to say they were hesitant about the vaccine."
5819,I know there are plenty of anti-vax millennials but there are far more who are pro-science.
5820,"It seems like AZ were expecting to be treated as heroes, and were massively unprepared to deal with the geopolitics."
5821,Sadly you and I know some of the same types of people.
5822,Adults in developed world certainly - perhaps the challenge trials would be more relevant if carried out in children?
5823,For me I won't really feel safe until the numbers in my area have dropped and we stop having new cases.
5824,I'm in a rural area and we had over 100 new cases last week.
5825,The vaccines will get us to lower numbers but until that happens I'm still on edge when I'm around people I don't know who are maskless.
5826,"That's the point of the vaccines, to get the numbers low enough that kids and those who can't get vaccinated can feel as safe as you do."
5827,"My appointment was for the Moderna, but when I arrived what they had was the J&amp;J - so I took it."
5828,What if they‚Äôre off by half?
5829,"Thats still 280,000 deaths."
5830,Most of which were completely unnecessary.
5831,"At no other time in the last 100 years has there been hospital morgues worldwide been overwhelmed to the point of using refrigerated trucks, ERs completely over capacity for weeks at a time, and a massive shortage of respiratory support devices that caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people."
5832,A person has to be a complete moron to believe that COVID-19 wasn't the cause of an enormous number of excess deaths.
5833,It goes back to the adage about asking a person what evidence would be sufficient for them to change their mind.
5834,"If their answer is that no amount would be enough, you're dealing with a fanatic not a rationalist."
5835,This is why having a few nationalised pharmaceuticals is strategically crucial.
5836,"I wish there were an EU-wide ""federal"" strategic medicine production company that could act independently of the profit motive and drive prices down."
5837,Are you sure is going to be for vaccinated people only?
5838,"I was hoping is for everyone, i am vaccinated but I was hoping to be able to take my kids to the zoo or a theme park this summer without one."
5839,"Lucky to have him, but IMO it's worth bearing in mind he's just one visible man representing a body of knowledge, and is not infallible at all."
5840,"The elevation of individuals like Fauci is misguided I think, it makes them targets and leads to team mentality where you end up with unfair criticism and illogical blanket defense."
5841,"Fauci the individual often became a talking point, overshadowing the message."
5842,"He made a major mistake in telling people they ""shouldn't"" be wearing masks back when there was a mask shortage."
5843,"I wish he had just come clean and said ""masks are probably a good idea, but we need to prioritize healthcare workers, the patriotic thing to do is make your own at home until we have got past the shortage""."
5844,"Instead he said things that fueled mask skepticism at the time, and said things that were not true."
5845,"I'm sure there will be people who read this comment and will make excuses for him, but I think it's far more valuable to remove the infallibility from Fauci and acknowledge he's human and made mistakes."

5970,"There's still massive production issues (because scaling up adreno vaccines always seems to be difficult, regardless of the company) and with the third wave in full swing and the bodies piling up, people are clamouring for an export ban."

5972,"Sure, it didn't work out like that in the end, but it very well could have."

Last point - stop with this nonsense that EU ""doesn't want"" this vaccine."

6004,How about you?
6005,You obviously don't care about the data.
6006,I showed a good article and you chose to see the lowest case count without seeing the confounding factors.
6007,You choose to ignore the impact of vaccination and then falsely claim masks aren't needed outdoors even though that is a wildly incorrect statement.
6008,I told a prospective study in a controlled environment only can show accurate data which I know you don't have.
6009,You cite a low risk yet don't see the people suffering because of that.
6010,That's more than a high risk for me seeing people admitted from a condition that could have been prevented but didn't thanks to their own hubris.
6011,And when I say that you say I am making an emotional plea.
6012,I would lock you up to prevent you from being a danger to others if I could.
6013,This sub is already infected with people like you and against my best judgement I made a statement to make people understand that masking is still a good thing.
6014,People like you won't be swayed no matter what I say.
6015,Because wearing a mask is too much.
6016,You would rather gamble and ask others to gamble to with covid cause you don't want to be told what to do.
6017,You don't see the consequences of it.

6022,Can you quote the part where it does?
6023,&gt;He also acknowledged that masks were initially not recommended to the general public so that first responders wouldn‚Äôt feel the strain of a shortage of PPE.
6024,That's not the same as him lying about mask efficacy.
6025,He's also absolutely correct about masks not being 100% protective.

6027,"Yup, neither of us is a lawyer (as far as I know), and these are very complex matters."
6028,"I for one think it's good that it will be actually tested in court, so that we won't have to speculate once it's settled."
6029,"&gt; I suspect the EU doesn't care of they win or lose, it's just a distraction to cover up their own procurement shortcoming."
6030,"I doubt they wouldn't do this if they didn't at least have a chance of winning, as losing in court is definitely not a way of saving face."

6043,Your body is the most sophisticated complex creature on this entire planet and has evolved to withstand millions of different bacteria.
6044,"That small amount that may enter you, is still not enough to make you sick or even test postive (if body already destroyed it)"
6045,Disappointed this has never been a big part of the political discourse of the pandemic
6046,"When 2,977 people died on Sept. 11, 2001, it was cause enough for Republican-led America to make a declaration of war on another sovereign nation."
6047,"Even today, if you dare besmirch the sacrifice of those who perished in the towers or at the pentagon, you‚Äôll get furious glares from bystanders."
6048,"Yet when literally 190 times as many people die of something that could‚Äôve probably been prevented with the right measures, Republicans don‚Äôt just ignore the suffering; they actively campaign to make it WORSE."
6049,"If I was responsible for the deaths of even just 10 people, I would likely be put to death."
6050,"Imagine having the sheer fucking audacity to have the blood of half a million dead Americans on your hands and still say, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand why I should stop letting them die.‚Äù"

6061,"I‚Äôm sorry, but this was one of the dumbest interview questions I‚Äôve ever heard."
6062,It was only meant to be inflammatory and create conflict.
6063,‚ÄúShould everybody get a vaccine?‚Äù Obviously the answer is yes and obviously Ron Johnson is an idiot.
6064,"Fauci is a medical professional and the more he‚Äôs subjected to this asinine, political theatre then so is the pandemic...and it‚Äôs getting us nowhere at this point."
6065,People have already made their minds up whether they‚Äôre getting vaccinated or not.
6066,"Just give people some real information, and let the pundits and politicians deal with stupid interviews like this..."
6067,"They will unironically ask you how you could possibly know if you've never been there without an ounce of shame or self reflection

Meanwhile, all of the things they know are true despite them having never seen them in person."

6086,Honestly this is what grates on me when someone says ‚Äúwearing masks is a cost less thing for you to do ‚Äù.
6087,"Actually no, it‚Äôs not."
6088,"They are certainly better and much easier than lockdowns, but first they are uncomfortable."
6089,"Second, I can‚Äôt see anyone‚Äôs face which makes communication annoying and more difficult."
6090,"Seeing faces is very important for human communication, lots of information is conveyed via subtle muscle movements."
6091,"I‚Äôll wear them while they are mandated and needed to slow spread, but I get real testy when I hear people suggesting ‚Äúwe should just continue mask mandates forever because they are cost less and look how safe from disease it keeps us‚Äù."

6095,&gt;One source told CNN that the State Department had worked to get vaccines to locations where personnel live on campus -- including in Kabul and Baghdad -- which may have contributed to the Mission being so late in the queue.
6096,"President Joe Biden spoke with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi ""committing that the United States and India will work closely together in the fight against COVID-19,"" according to a White House readout."
6097,"Reported Covid-19 case rates in India have hit global highs for the past five consecutive days, hospitals have run out of beds, medicine, ventilators and oxygen, and thousands have died amid a devastating second wave, which began last month."

6124,"&gt;Shouldn't have signed a contract saying they would accept best reasonable efforts, and relinquishing their right to sue if there are supply problems then."
6125,"That's not what ""best efforts"" entails at all."
6126,"It doesn't mean AZ can underdeliver by 69 million doses, miss multiple *revised* shipment targets established by them, and nothing happens."
6127,It means the burden of proof is on the EU to prove AZ hasn't acted diligently compared to other vaccine companies.
6128,We have 50% of adults in the US vaccinated.
6129,I think that 70% of total population seems like a pretty high bar without legally enforcing it.

6143,It‚Äôs a little weird (but not completely uncommon) here to even see someone wearing a mask while walking in the parking lot on the way in to a store...
6144,So what happens if only the spike protein resulting from the vaccine (no virus attached) binds to the ACE2 receptors?
6145,Do they block the receptors?
6146,How long until they unbind?
6147,It seems like a bad idea to gum up a bunch of receptors and keep them performing their normal function.

6167,The vaccine may be effective but the way AZ handled the release/any press related material was amateur at best.
6168,We‚Äôre at a point now where we have surplus of doses with the 3 we have already approved so we can donate AZ to the rest of the world.

6270,"I remember reading that obese people have a harder time of effectiveness with flu shots,  I wonder if it's the same with the covid shots"
6271,What would that do to Moderna‚Äôs EUA?
6272,"If they‚Äôd still keep it since it was authorized before Pfizer submitted, then I don‚Äôt see any reason not to."
6273,"If one of them submitting would lock the other out, though, a pact of staying on EUA might be better."
6274,They should go to India first
6275,And yet I still cant go to a baseball game without one.
6276,I imagined not everyone will want to be vaccinated but I never expected it to be at this scale.
6277,Could the virus mutate in a way that destroys all our vaccine efforts?
6278,"So far the vaccines still work against existing mutations but if people keep refusing to get vaccinated and restrictions are (inevitably) removed, things could get ugly."
6279,Should at least advise stadiums should be wearing them
6280,"Chicago has done its own (stricter) thing throughout a lot of this, so that's why we don't know if we'll be following the rest of the state yet - the mayor hasn't clarified yet if we will, so it's up in the air."
6281,"In terms of IL, you're correct, but that wasn't the only requirement."
6282,"We actually got the 70% number almost a month ago, but hospitalizations also ticked up so we're still in phase 4."
6283,"Looking like we'll be able to move forward within the next week or two now, assuming we stay on the current hospital trajectories."
6284,It‚Äôs $23.99 for a 2-pack.
6285,"Yes, he was, and shockingly the state is listening compared to other states."
6286,"I still see people without a mask, but the state is listening."
6287,"I think it is because Justice flat out told us to ""fucking"" wear the mask."
6288,"Yes, he said ""fucking"" on live television."
6289,"He takes this ""mask"" order seriously."
6290,I am curious if this payment will apply to those who already obtained the vaccine.
6291,It would be nice if he does this for all who get and got the vaccine.
6292,I got it when it first came out.
6293,"Also, Jim is a previous Democrat."
6294,"Justice didn't have a good past or rep, but he did make right later down the road."
6295,[removed]
6296,How silly.
6297,So where we lucky that this mechanism was in the corona virus?
6298,Is there a chance that it mutates so this mechanism is not there any longer?
6299,"Yes, emergent was the initial contract and catalent was contracted a couple months later."
6300,I dont believe they have found an emergent replacement though yet since as of recently they had to move out.
6301,Fauci just said we still need to wear a mask outside even fully vaccinated.
6302,Thats as safe a situation were ever going to get.
6303,"If we have to keep wearing a mask even then, where does it end?"
6304,"Its saying things like this thats going to make people say Fuck it and ask ""Why should I get fully vaccinated if I still am going to need to wear a mask even outdoors where transmission was slim to begin with?"""
6305,I belive the recommendation is anway that you only should were masks if you are in proximity to other non-houshold people.
6306,"Yeah, back in the good old days Smallpox was 30% fatal."
6307,Thank goodness your parents got you that vaccine.
6308,Without modern medicine I probably would have been stillborn.
6309,"If not, dead at 2."
6310,Definitely dead from either slow dehydration or internal sepsis at 45.
6311,"So, whatever dumb thoughts you're having about vaccines or the other marvels of modern medicine, get your head on straight."
6312,"&gt; Geddes, N.Y. ‚Äî New York is increasing its capacity limits on outdoor stadiums, outdoor performing arts venues, casinos, gyms and offices, Gov."
6313,"Andrew Cuomo said today


&gt;The capacity limit on large outdoor stadiums and performing arts venues will go from 20% to 33% starting May 19."
6314,The limit for gyms and fitness centers outside New York City goes from 33% to 50% starting May 15.
6315,"&gt;Casinos will be able to operate at 50% capacity, up from 25%, and offices will go from 50% to 75%."
6316,Those new limits also begin May 15.
6317,Fantastic progress in New York.
6318,"Remembering where we were a year ago, this is so great."
6319,Confidence intervals are larger for Moderna due to the smaller population size.
6320,Less statistical power.
6321,It wouldn't surprise me if Moderna were more effective with a single dose though.
6322,Explains the higher incidence of side effects.
6323,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt;That order made sense when it was given."
6324,Maybe.
6325,That's the crux of the argument (i.e.
6326,whether outdoor transmission is a thing.
6327,"&gt;It was given during a time when NY was getting slammed with COVID, at that time, you should have been wearing a mask if you couldn't maintain 6 ft distance."
6328,The healthcare system depended on you doing that.
6329,"That hasn't been true since early May, yet the same rules have remained in place."
6330,It Means we can all enjoy the summer with family and friends have cookouts and enjoy life
6331,More like the CDC
6332,[removed]
6333,"Nah, definitely need nurses or PA's doing the shots, too much liability."
6334,"You should be able to get the J&amp;J shot at the local CVS or Walgreens though, if it doesn't need the super freezers."
6335,Post viral syndromes occur extremely rarely.
6336,Covid appears to have a 10-30% incidence of post viral issues.
6337,It‚Äôs a very large difference.
6338,&gt;How many have been reinfected?
6339,Do you have that answer?
6340,Because I think this is the problem.
6341,I don't think that's an easy number to get.
6342,I don‚Äôt think the at cost thing is even remotely relevant to AZ‚Äô shortfalls.
6343,"So don‚Äôt worry, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll make any difference whatsoever."
6344,Perhaps AZ won‚Äôt produce a vaccine ever again.
6345,That might be likely.
6346,"The transmission levels outside do not remotely justify the mental health and social harm impact of wearing them outside

Living in public outside where we can actully get fresh air and feel normalcy and see humans smile is a big deal, and basically zero transmission outside doesn‚Äôt justify it

Mask shaming outside is a large contributor to the hypochondriatic hygenie theatre that will take more months if not years to pull back

It shouldn‚Äôt be about politeness, it should be about science

‚Äî

Tldr; outdoor masking atthis point fuels hygenie theatre which itself greatly increases hypochondria which is massively detrimental overall to mental health"
6347,"I'd say the reason, but I'll probably get banned or comment removed again."
6348,"Just be aware that ""long influenza"" and ""long measles"" and ""long chickenpox"" and ""long herpes"" are all a thing too."
6349,I bet the beams are coming out of all those 5G microchips.
6350,[removed]
6351,2 years?
6352,It hasn't been that long yet right?
6353,I HATE this.
6354,I did a study on the patients we lost in 2020 who had COVID.
6355,"Almost all of them had something else going on (diabetes, obesity, etc...)."
6356,But you know what?
6357,Not one of them would have \*died\* from those comorbidities without COVID.
6358,The point is: COVID-19 steals years.
6359,Those people would be alive today without the pandemic.
6360,"And they are still extremely unreliable with huge week-to-week changes in deliveries, often being communicated in the very last minute."
6361,I remember when New York reopened their marinas this subreddit lost their collective minds.
6362,Good to see positive news like this.
6363,I‚Äôm less enthusiastic about projections of a ‚Äúnormal summer‚Äù but fully expect to have a good summer regardless.
6364,Thank you.
6365,In fact these were known to me and forwarded to my friend (he's super careful and scared due to a family history of heart problems but would NEED social contacts beyond online work or he will flip someday).
6366,"The problem is, and that is something these authors also state, that we just don't have studies explicitly made to investigate this and it would be super hard to do so."
6367,"Problem is, if you want to convince someone with a scientific mind (he holds a PhD in particle physics, i hold one in bilogy/physiology), you need very solid evidence."
6368,"But i will get him to sit in my garden, on distance, and enjoy a talk."
6369,"Hope he gets his vaccination soon, but we're in Germany, he's too young to be scheduled anytime soon"
6370,How much can that possibly be?
6371,"I mean I really don't think people will take AZ, we have a lot of vaccines already"
6372,"You probably already have an appointment or have already received your first shot, but just in case you do not - there are appointments readily available across Massachusetts as early as tomorrow based on [Vaccine Spotter for Massachusetts](https://www.vaccinespotter.org/MA/)."
6373,Except there are legitimate reasons to believe Florida is undercounting.
6374,Excess deaths have been found to be running high in FL in a recent academic study.
6375,"Florida is testing very little per hundred thousand people, with high positivity."
6376,That indicates under testing.
6377,There was that incident where a conservative conspiracy blogger was given access to death certificates.
6378,There was the issue with them terminating the data scientist who claims that she was asked to manipulate the numbers.
6379,This is all against the backdrop of the governor having clear national political ambitions built in large part on his claims to success handling Covid.
6380,"Sundays always have artificial low numbers, in almost every country in the world, since the beggining of the pandemic."
6381,Also mondays.
6382,"It's not gonna happen, so I'd drop it, and go with the alt"
6383,Laws should also make sense from an ease of implementation sense and cause the least disruption for the general public.
6384,We've got 30k ventilators we ordered from the first lockdown which we aren't using so why are we only sending 500?
6385,But not the sales department who made all these empty promises
6386,I just chose Hawaii in August instead.
6387,I enjoy doing hiking and beaches in Europe so going during winter feels like a waste.
6388,Why do you need to wear a seat belt when you have airbags?
6389,Why have crumple zones?
6390,"Also, SARS was a even more deadlier 'cold' virus."
6391,AZ seems to have promised a delivery schedule that it could never meet by a large margin even in the most optimistic of scenarios.
6392,"It was one of the main vaccines of the EU vaccination campaign, intended to deliver a total of 300 million doses by the end of Q2."
6393,"As well as 100 million doses to the UK, in presumably the same time frame using partly the same production facilities."
6394,"They were using four main production sites, one in Belgium, one in the Netherlands and two in the UK."
6395,"One site in the USA was also listed as a backup facility, but it was never supposed to be anything but a replacement for production issues in Europe."
6396,What is their production capacity?
6397,"That's not well known, but solid estimates I have seen puts the Belgian plant at 8 million doses per Month, the Dutch one at 4 million and the UK ones together at 8 million."
6398,"This is peak production capacity by the way, not average."
6399,"Together, they could produce 20 million doses per month."
6400,And there lies the problem.
6401,That's 120 million doses over 6 months.
6402,"If it was operating for a year, that's still 160 million doses short of what it was supposed to deliver to the UK and the EU."
6403,There is thus no way they could have ever fulfilled their contract.
6404,"Furthermore, they had a contractual obligation to inform the European Commission of production problems ASAP and the EC was contractually obliged to help them resolve it."
6405,This appears to not have been done.
6406,"Had they been early with this information, and production volumes been realistic the EU would have been able to plan around it."

6413,Evonik was founded 2006 and is a daughter of RAG that was founded in 1968.
6414,You are talking shit.
6415,"I'd say it's safe, but not 100% safe."
6416,"Let's assume you and your friends are all vaccinated with Pfizer (so a 95% protection against catching it - note that this means that if you vaccinate 100 people with it, 5 people will catch it, not that all 100 people individually only have a 5% chance of catching it)."
6417,"If you go to the airbnb with a vaccinated friend, the likelihood  that both of you are 'one of the 5' = 5% x 5% = 0,25%."
6418,So really low.
6419,"It's also reasonable to assume that, since being vaccinated lowers your risk of heavy symptoms, you're less likely to be super contagious even if you do catch it (because you're not sneezing and coughing a lot)."
6420,"Which in turn would mean even if you do spread it to your brother, it's less likely to make him sick (it's also reasonable to assume that infection with a low viral load leads to less serious symptoms)."
6421,You could also mitigate the risk further by wearing a mask around your brother until you keep testing negative until two weeks after the trip.
6422,"At this point, the risk is pretty infinitesimal."
6423,"But still not 0,00%."
6424,"Given how serious you're taking this, if you trust your friends to be fully vaccinated, I'd say go ahead."
6425,I'd say your brother is at a far greater risk of contracting it just from the people in his life going about their essential duties than from you going on this trip (assuming people drive to the airbnb) .
6426,"I'm not a doctor though, perhaps checking with your physician would be best"
6427,Data is pretty old.
6428,"As of now, EU has exported 155mln doses."

6434,*
6435,"Risk multiplies, so it depends on how risky your other behaviors are."
6436,"Keep in mind that the vaccine efficacy numbers we're seeing are all based on a population that is, for the most part, continuing to distance and wear masks."
6437,Efficacy can and will drop in populations of people that are swapping aerosols without masks on.
6438,"If you put yourself in a situation where an individual has a near 100% chance of being infected, say, putting yourself in a room with someone who is infected, without masks on, you have somewhere between a 1-in-3 at the high end (J&amp;J numbers) and 1-in-10 at the low end (Moderna real-world numbers) of being infected."
6439,"Your risk goes up as you increase your exposure, because having more viral particles enter your body makes it more difficult for your immune system to keep up."
6440,"So... if you're indoors and maskless with vaccinated folks, your risk is quite low."
6441,"If you're indoors and maskless with someone who has COVID, your personal risk is significant."
6442,"It's up to you whether or not you're willing to tolerate that risk, but I just want people to understand what they're signing up for because the population-level statistics on vaccine efficacy can be misleading."
6443,"My personal recommendation, and the recommendation of the CDC, is to only be indoors and maskless with other vaccinated folks for right now, at least until community spread plummets, which it will soon, hopefully."
6444,"I explain the stats in more depth in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUS/comments/mrptyy/99992_of_fully_vaccinated_people_have_dodged/gupklx8?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) on a related thread, and I also recommend [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3odScka55A) that explains the vaccination stats quite well."
6445,And what will you say when the EU lose?
6446,I get it.
6447,"I thought they were going down that ""wear a mask year round so you don't give your cold to someone else"" route."
6448,I'm pretty sure I misread the first few comments.
6449,I fully support mask use everywhere until the pandemic ends.
6450,üëçüèº
6451,another way to put it in the fully vaccinated scenario: the mask is a talisman being deployed for emotional support.
6452,and honestly that's fine!
6453,the above may sound judgey but coming from me at least it's not.
6454,do what ya gotta.
6455,as long as it doesn't extend to mandating talismans as public policy.
6456,The internet is a series of tubes.
6457,&gt; President Biden is expected to announce tomorrow that the CDC has updated its guidance for wearing masks.
6458,"Multiple people say that new guidance will pertain to whether vaccinated people should wear masks outdoors, though the final language is still unclear."

6461,Are they?
6462,"I haven‚Äôt read anything on it, please provide me a link if you don‚Äôt mind."
6463,"Sounds interesting, and a little surprising."
6464,"Though if  Novavax/Valeneva have such little faith in their own capabilities that they think they‚Äôll do another AZ, then the EU is probably better off without tbh."
6465,Tommy is this dumb.
6466,I've met him.
6467,It's breathtaking
6468,"Luckily, you are not in charge."
6469,&gt;The risk isn't very low.
6470,It's low.
6471,"It can be up to 10% depending on the situation

Also you're still misusing the data."
6472,"Your risk of catching it is not ""up to 10%"" outside."
6473,"The number of infections attributed to outside transmission might be as many as 10% of the total depending on the study (or &lt;1%, to be accurate)."
6474,COVID has a 20-25% attack rate (learned from the Diamond Princess incident).
6475,That is your base risk of catching it indoors in close proximity without any mitigation strategies.
6476,"Putting on a mask, or social distancing, or being outside drops that considerably."
6477,"So if you're going to overstate the risk, at least try to do it in a reasonable way."
6478,"So beyond all your blathering about not trusting people, or misusing the scientific data, you really have nothing other than ""I don't find it to be a big deal, so we should force everyone to do it until the risk is zero""."
6479,That's not enough to make universal wide-reaching mandatory regulations.
6480,"&gt;	This will be much less of an issue by June, when vaccine deliveries should be larger than demand."
6481,It will still be an issue.
6482,More than 40 million Germans won‚Äôt be fully immunized (second vaccination + vaccination pass) until at least September.
6483,"Yes it is the point, they are not yet signing because they aren‚Äôt currently sure."
6484,"Hesitant means holding back on signing, which is exactly what is happening here with Valneva and Novavax."
6485,They don‚Äôt want an arduous legal battle with the EU and be forced to play political games.
6486,All the negotiations are kept secret so who knows how long any of these companies have been negotiating.
6487,I wouldn't use a weather forecast last month to determine if I'll wear a jacket tomorrow.
6488,"I'm honestly fine with people not wearing a mask based on their own judgement, but you can't expect CDC to tell people not to wear a mask outside based on shitty data."
6489,"AZ has broken their contract with the EU multiple times by now, might as well do the same to them."
6490,"It looks like J&amp;J are doing the same, cutting deliveries to the EU in favor of the US."
6491,keeping mum and dad alive?
6492,"Yeah, but he wears safety glasses while breaking windows."
6493,He‚Äôs not going to be unsafe about it.
6494,Full FDA approval is a given and is just an administrative step at this point.
6495,"Anyone waiting for ""Fill approval"" is just deluding themselves at this point."
6496,"If that's the legal minimum necessary for a college to require a vaccine, great, all the kids will need one by the fall semester."
6497,Don‚Äôt worry there‚Äôs plenty of people in Ron Johnson‚Äôs district organizing to oust him (myself included).
6498,Then the US has to pay for damages resulted from breaking the contract.
6499,i.e potential lost sales that AZ could have made if the USA didn‚Äôt ship the vaccines over.
6500,Dodgers?
6501,Most haven't been eligible until like a week ago.
6502,[removed]
6503,Issues in production doesn't account for a shortfall of over 100m doses over the course of 6 months.
6504,That is blatant incompetence.
6505,"And the Merck deal was actually poised to go through, the part that failed was the UK governments requirement to produce within the UK which Merck wouldn't guarantee even if it could have meant more doses for the UK and everybody."
6506,"Friendly reminder that if you‚Äôre vaccinated and in a location that doesn‚Äôt require masks, you don‚Äôt have to wear one."
6507,Continuing to do so out of ‚Äúother people‚Äôs comfort‚Äù is quickly transitioning from act of kindness to an act of perpetuating anxiety.
6508,The vaccinated can do their part to normalize returning to normalcy.
6509,Is Fire Saga playing?
6510,Is anyone else worried about the slowdown?
6511,I feel like we‚Äôre exhausting our population of willing individuals and starting to hit the percentage of the US population that are antivax...
6512,Doh!
6513,Of course it does.
6514,My bad.
6515,Makes the argument even weaker
6516,I am a millennial.
6517,I'm talking about people my own age.
6518,What variant are we up to now?
6519,Double-decker mutant?
6520,Triple dog dare strain?
6521,Hard to keep track of what I‚Äôm supposed to be scared of this week.
6522,I mean... Herd immunity so obviously no one would have a mask.
6523,"Every viral ""species"" is, in reality, a constantly churning sea of variants."
6524,And I don't recall people being terrified that one of the common cold coronaviruses was going to suddenly morph into Captain Trips a couple years ago.
6525,Couldn't they use some sort of anchor to keep that from happening?
6526,"The latrines are allowed, it's the other peeing that they're cracking down on."
6527,Because people have been told that common sense and science are some kind of liberal lie
6528,"I agree with what you‚Äôre saying, also FYI I am also Indian but live in London, I have family in Gujarat though so I know how bad it is, I was just saying that bringing first world countries like Australia and New Zealand into the argument didn‚Äôt make sense at least to me because their populations are tiny compared to India and like you said India is quite cramped at times compared to Australia where people are more spread out, plus those countries can afford to give everyone basic pay, I wasn‚Äôt trying to be malicious or anything btw, I know how bad it is in India but the comparison confused me that‚Äôs all"
6529,"I hate to tell you, but because of these irresponsible, ignorant people this virus will be around forever most likely."
6530,It‚Äôll never ‚Äúblow over‚Äù.
6531,We‚Äôll most likely need a booster every year just like the flu because there will always be a host base for the virus to infect in the US due to the anti-vax and anti-science movements.
6532,These dumb asses will still be dying from this years from now.
6533,Mark my words.
6534,thanks sex beast 420
6535,"No the poster above you is correct, I'm a millennial who's getting vaccinated, but some of my peers aren't and some of their comments are essentially fuck the boomers."
6536,"Just call them pro-covid people, which they are."
6537,Laws need to be based on the science and not on some forgetful people
6538,The Merk deal fell apart because Oxford university didn‚Äôt like the terms.
6539,AZ was the only company they actually agreed to proposed terms.
6540,"Also we don‚Äôt know if we wouldn‚Äôt have seen production issues or testing issues with Merck, the chance might have been reduced but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs outright fair to say it would have all been roses with another company."
6541,"J&amp;J are struggling with production, it seems like Ad based vaccines are hard to scale for production"
6542,"They just opened it up to my age group (16 to 45), like a month ago in NY (and in most of the us) and already about 40% of the 20 to 45 have been vaccinated."
6543,Remember appointments are complicated and employers aren't giving time off for the shot or the recovery.
6544,"The previous groups were older, many retired, often with a support structure (assisted living, home care, doctors appointments covered by Medicare, money to take time off if they are still working) that doesn't exist for the younger generation."
6545,Seems we're doing fairly well.
6546,"I don't think this is a generational issue, it's a capitalist issue."
6547,[removed]
6548,"The Oxford vaccine was meant to be open, but last minute they restricted it and went with AZ instead."
6549,"So if anything the choice was not between profit or at cost, it was between open or restricted production, and clearly the wrong choice was made."
6550,"The data is as of April 15th, so you are saying EU doubled it's supply in 10 days?"
6551,Nah.
6552,Ok.
6553,"I'd still wait 14 days, per the CDC."
6554,i would like to see some evidence that youngsters are not getting vaccinating because they want there parents/grandparents to become ill/possibly die because of global warming.
6555,"also, apple and oranges much?"
6556,"Global warming is a fucking massively difficult, geo-political issue that has so many moving parts to solve that it would make your head hurt."
6557,Destroying the economy?
6558,"covid to one side, we are living in one of the most prosperous times of peace and wealth."
6559,"High life expectancy, free education until you 18, a endless and unlimited source of entertainment and information that you can hold in your hand."

6594,They are looking to open up vaccinations for everybody (18-59 year olds) in either May or June.
6595,&gt; At the current vaccination pace we will not get close to global herd immunity this year.
6596,"So far vaccine deliveries have basically doubled every month, and they are looking to ramp up even more in the coming time."
6597,"Vaccination pace *is increasing* and has been for the whole year, so assuming ""current pace"" is outright wrong."
6598,"And even then, the EU is *currently* receiving around 4 doses per 100 pop and week (to increase to 6-7 from this week, but let's do the calculation with 4)."
6599,"Assuming 70% fully vaccinated for herd immunity, i.e."
6600,"140 doses per 100 pop, and 30 doses per 100 pop already given, it would mean we need an additional 110 doses per 100 pop."
6601,"With 4 doses per 100 pop and week, this would be finished in November."
6602,"So, **even with no increase in production whatsoever, there will be enough doses in November for herd immunity in the EU**."
6603,"As the deliveries *will* increase, it will happen far sooner than that."
6604,It's just an overly pessimistic calculation.
6605,"&gt; So, either half of the 45 attendees of the indoor reception got it when indoors

I am absolutely suggesting that this is (to a good approximation) exactly what happened."
6606,Go through those indoor photos and cross-reference them to the people we know got sick at the event.
6607,They're basically all there.
6608,&gt;  or the people packed together outside hugging and talking at length with one another also got it outdoors.
6609,"While I don't doubt that a couple of people got sick out side (it's far less likely, but not impossible), I am absolutely suggesting that ""half the 45 attendees of the indoor reception caught covid"" is likely *very* close to the truth."
6610,Who cares about ideology when it's a public health crisis.
6611,That type of politicization of a public health emergency is the reason why US responded so slowly and inadequately.
6612,This isn't a pissing contest.
6613,AstraZeneca was contracted to provide 120 million doses of the vaccine in Q1 and 180 million in Q2.
6614,"Had AstraZeneca been honest about what they'd actually be able to deliver (&lt;30 million doses in Q1, and what appears to be a similar shortfall in Q2), the EU would have made very different decisions about what vaccines to purchase and in what quantities."
6615,AstraZeneca either made fraudulent claims about what they could deliver or they're criminally incompetent.
6616,Either way they've caused significant harm to vaccination efforts in the EU and need to be held accountable.

6624,If that's the way you choose to look at it.
6625,People for from covid without believing that they have covid...
6626,So....
6627,There's that
6628,If I were the mayor or someone in charge I would definitely institute mask mandates in public parks or outdoor areas where I know there can be crowds of upto 50.
6629,The risk isn't very low.
6630,It's low.
6631,It can be upto 10% depending on the situation.
6632,And I wouldn't want to be the one who caused people to get sick and potentially die because of that.
6633,Of course all this is assuming people are unvaccinated.
6634,I don't trust people to make their decisions because this sub itself has enough people to convince me otherwise.
6635,And this matters.
6636,You save lives because of this.
6637,Don't downplay that.
6638,Also masks aren't a burden.
6639,How is a small barrier on your face a burden?
6640,Far more people follow much more inconvenient rules.
6641,"People wear seat belts, don't dump their trash on the road, don't piss on the street."
6642,There are rulebreakers for these too but they are a rarity.
6643,People can be compliant when they want to.
6644,Most people are told to do this and not asked to make a judgement.
6645,So why are people making a fuss for such a simple measure?
6646,And why do you think this scenario needs the people to decide for themselves?
6647,"When it reduces your risk from close to 10% (not a miniscule risk) to almost negligible for a deadly disease, it's almost a no brainer."
6648,Is it because they are in large numbers and this is a political issue?
6649,All I see is reduce your to negligible with a simple mask in crowded places till you are vaccinated.
6650,"No stay at home, no loss of wages, no devastating measure till you get vaccinated."
6651,At the rate it is going it is hardly a few months.
6652,What is so hard in this?
6653,Help me understand.
6654,Can I return my vaccine ?
6655,There's already a phase 3 trial going on for an oral therepeutic to fight moderate cases of covid (RVV's Bucillamine drug).
6656,Pfizer's behind.
6657,You guys were wearing masks outside?
6658,"I thought the driver was crowding, not density?"
6659,I've got absolutely no idea why this has 4 downvotes.
6660,That is cute.
6661,"Just wait until you hear ""no definitive plan to lift restrictions anytime soon or later""."
6662,"I live in Massachusetts, which has the 2nd highest vaccination rate in the whole US."
6663,"Governor Baker has zero plans to [lift any restriction, even the outdoor mask mandate](https://whdh.com/news/group-calls-on-gov-baker-to-lift-states-outdoor-mask-wearing-mandate/)."
6664,"He has just [raised the goal](https://www.boston.com/news/coronavirus/2021/04/22/charlie-baker-vaccine-supply-states-surplus-doses) for the number of people fully vaccinated with 2 doses from 4 million, increased to 5 million adults now, which is greater than 90% of the adult population who will need 2 doses now."
6665,I think the 5 million fully vaccinated is the goal for which Governor Baker would lift restrictions in Massachusetts.
6666,"However, Governor Baker has said he might revisit this on [like April 30th or something](https://whdh.com/news/stay-tuned-for-covid-announcement-baker-says/), not sure."
6667,Here is the problem.
6668,You need 70% of people to have had the vaccine to get herd immunity.
6669,Without that the virus will continue to spread.
6670,There are some people that can‚Äôt medically have the vaccine.
6671,There had to be some push to get enough people vaccinated otherwise we may as well all stay locked up forever.
6672,At some point the rights of the country have to be put above an individuals rights.

6685,&gt;You can still spread it but it‚Äôs a lot lot less likely.
6686,"The issue is that constantly talking about how the virus can still be spread, even though it's extremely unlikely, makes it seem more likely to the point where people should be concerned about it."
6687,I don't believe I've ever gone to a convention without buying tickets from some sleazy man on the sidewalk.

6696,A member of the Medical Council to the prime minister explained that in her opinionthese people should pay for their own treatment if they contract COVID-19and will soon present his proposal to Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
6697,"\- I believe that instead of penalizing vaccinations, after we make vaccinations available to everyone, payment for COVID-19 treatment should be introduced - she said in the program Facts after Facts on TVN24."

6710,last Tuesday
6711,"Oh I'm well aware, I was just commenting on the way that the original commenter said it"
6712,Exactly.
6713,Super Smart people are incharge everywhere.
6714,I think we're at that long tail now - I still think we'll get to 65-70% of adults that get the shot but we're running out of people that are willing to adjust their lives in any significant way (whether to get to a clinic or set up an appointment) in order to do so.
6715,Major increases in first-dose administration will likely only come from expansion to younger ages from here and we'll sort of catch the rest of the adults through widespread availability in places they already go.
6716,It was time
6717,Okay that makes sense.
6718,So all these variants are actually not a fast mutation but a rather slow one?
6719,"&gt;991,183 first dose shots."
6720,"Whoa, when was the last time we were under 1M?"
6721,Yeah.
6722,We are definitely at an inflection point regardless of what happened with J&amp;J.
6723,"But I also know quite a few people who really wanted the J&amp;J because they felt it was easier just having to do the one shot, and because it wasn‚Äôt the ‚Äúnew technology‚Äù (I know üòë) so they felt more comfortable with it."
6724,Now everyone is scared of J&amp;J and who knows if they will end up getting one of the other ones.
6725,So the snafu definitely didn‚Äôt help the situation.
6726,I think you're misrepresenting the reality of the situation here when you declare that phase 3 has passed.
6727,"A more accurate statement is that based off the initial phase 3 data, there was sufficient evidence to show the benefits outweigh the risks for the EUA."
6728,"A key part of the complete phase 3 is understanding long term efficacy and safety, typically studied over 1-4 years ([https://www.fda.gov/patients/drug-development-process/step-3-clinical-research](https://www.fda.gov/patients/drug-development-process/step-3-clinical-research))."
6729,"Obviously the pandemic helped speed up the short term efficacy data, which helped achieve the EUA, but one thing the pandemic can't do is speed up time for long term safety and efficacy."
6730,"Additionally, as stated in the FDA fact sheet for the Pfizer (the vaccine with the most history and available data) EUA ([https://www.fda.gov/media/144414/download](https://www.fda.gov/media/144414/download)):

&gt; The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine has not undergone the same type of review as an FDA-approved or cleared product."
6731,"FDA may issue an EUA when certain criteria are met, which includes that **there are no adequate, approved, available alternatives**."
6732,"In addition, the FDA decision is based on the totality of scientific evidence available showing that the product **may be effective** to prevent COVID-19 during the COVID-19 pandemic and that the **known and potential benefits of the product outweigh the known and potential risks** of the product."
6733,All of these criteria must be met to allow for the product to be used in the treatment of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.
6734,I think a fair question back to you is why do you think the fact that EUA was given means phase 3 was completed?
6735,Do you not question why if EUA was as good as a full FDA approval why there hasn't been a full FDA approval given yet?
6736,Please share any links.
6737,"As much as I've personally researched on the topic, I'm always open to being wrong or missing key information if shown the facts."
6738,The facts (as I understand them in good faith) are that the vaccines have NOT completed phase 3 long term safety and efficacy studies simply due to the fact that not enough time has passed and FDA has reviewed the data and approved the vaccines.
6739,"Btw, I'm pro-vaccine and even got vaccinated myself too."
6740,"But I think it's wrong to push vaccines with misinformation, just as much as I think it's wrong to push anti-vaxx narratives with false misinformation."
6741,It all adds to the mistrust.
6742,"It's probably too late now, but we would've all been better off if we stuck to the facts and science and gave everyone to determine for themselves and those that they're around whether the benefits outweigh the risks in their own personal situation."
6743,Good ole jimmy j is the biggest switchcoat you'll ever meet.

6780,"Simply waiving the patents for mRNA vaccines wouldn't do anything to spur production -- there's lots of know-how and required equipment to produce those that won't just magically go ""poof"" into existence."

6836,"&gt;‚ÄúKeep in mind what we communicate is subject to change as state and local guidelines are adjusted,‚Äù she added."
6837,So would it destroy the pharma industry or is no one else in the world able to produce mRNA vaccines anyway?
6838,It‚Äôs time to force news companies to become non-profit.
6839,"It‚Äôs the only way, but both sides use the media companies as agenda pushers so it will never happen"
6840,It's more of a general anti-authority thing than something specifically about the current restrictions.
6841,"They're anti-maskers and COVID truthers, not regular people."
6842,"Considering the collapse of health care system over in India, home cure would be god send for sure."
6843,Keeping fingers crossed pfizer can make this work and its not uber expensive.
6844,The article says 50 million are in various stages of production.
6845,So probably something like bulk drug substance and it needs fill finish.
6846,"1 in 20k would be significantly higher (0.005%), but also significantly lower than the risk of a healthy 30 year old man being hospitalised for Covid (around 2,7%)."
6847,&gt;That would've meant the EU would be just behind the USA in vaccinations.
6848,While not banning exports to other countries.
6849,It's a shame AZ underdelivered so massively.
6850,"Right, but they can choose to keep their kids out of harm's way lol."
6851,I don't expect to see kids out at bars or night clubs or in generally lit places anyway.
6852,I'm also not going to care about someone else's kids because it's not my job to.
6853,"Not gonna cough on them on purpose or go out of my way to be a dick, but also not gonna continue living in a bubble when i'm vaccinated and don't particularly care one way or another anymore."
6854,Two possibilities.
6855,1) you could try masktite which is pre-cut double sided medical tape.
6856,"2) N95 and KN95 material has much less resistance to airflow than cloth masks, so vapor will pass through it pretty uniformly."
6857,On an especially cold day you might still get fogging.
6858,I hope they say that vaccinated people no longer need to wear masks outside.
6859,Time to start differentiating the vaccinated versus the antivaxxers.
6860,"&gt;can still get/pass the virus,

People who treat this as a valid argument in any capacity don't understand risk assessment at all, it's depressing."
6861,Significant restrictions will be in place until summer; we still can't meet inside houses or go to big outdoor events or indoor eating/entertainment venues like cinemas and pubs.
6862,The last one in particular is a big issue in a country where people like the occasional drink.
6863,"There's also a large number of people who are generally dissatisfied with the direction the country has been going in over the past few decades, and who have projected their dissatisfaction onto the government's covid response, interpreting lockdowns and mask mandates as the latest in a long line of intolerable restrictions on their freedoms."
6864,Some of them even think the pandemic isn't real or is exaggerated.
6865,This is similar to what has been happening in the US.
6866,"I did the same for my brother (a conservative guy), but turns out he was excited about it."
6867,"Even gave me some edibles as a thank you, everyone wins"
6868,"That's exactly where it's coming from, yes."
6869,But I meant like I'm on the federal level paying people to take vaccines
6870,"Re: CA all capacity restrictions are supposed to be lifted june 15, but they are planning for mask mandates to continue beyond that point."
6871,Completely unnecessary security theater with questionable Big Tech undertones.
6872,Just use the paper vaccination cards.
6873,It's just as easy to generate a false vaccine passport than it is to make a fake paper vaccine card.
6874,"&gt;Not spreading it to others who may not be as fortunate as me

BUt YoU cAN sTIlL SPrEAD iT!!"
6875,!
6876,I'm pumped for this new phase
6877,I'm hoping we get a long tail now.
6878,The mountain seems to be falling as fast as it climbed.
6879,"That would be alarming, but given we are past halfway through everyone who is eligible at the moment (80% of the population), the decline makes some sense."
6880,"I love how you‚Äôre claiming the title is misquoting Fauci, and then you misquote him."
6881,‚ÄúQuite low‚Äù vs ‚Äúminuscule‚Äù are different descriptions.
6882,"If other people have access to the vaccine, you aren't putting them at risk."
6883,"At this point demand is less than supply, so who wants one can get one."
6884,"And people who are unable to get a vaccine due to medical issues, should be taki g measures because any virus would be an issue."
6885,Sad you want to shame people  for making their own decision.
6886,"It's like me saying you and everyone should carry a gun to protect their families, and you not wanting to own a gun."
6887,"Maybe people with a gun think others without a gun aren't protecting, but that doesn't make it any more correct"
6888,Thanks for the reply.
6889,Doing a quick google search tells me that this could last 2-3 years which is quite a long time.
6890,Hopefully my taste and smell normalize sooner...
6891,Honestly I would much rather have a lack of taste/smell than this nasty taste/smell.
6892,It probably is.
6893,They will use money from the vaccine administration pool to pay for it if they can.
6894,"CA is also has the least cases per capita in the country if I‚Äôm not mistaken, not exactly an apples to apples comparison"
6895,The primary producer in the USA was emergent...plenty of issues at that site.
6896,Yeah I was able to choose.

6900,It's not _only_ the health issues.
6901,It's cost.
6902,"If all staff at a hospital is vaccinated, then the staff-only areas no longer requires the same sanitation, social distancing and ventilation."
6903,This applies to workplaces in general that have staff-only areas.
6904,"Yep, walk ins are now available at some sites in Indiana"
6905,We should be advocating to allow the poorer countries to make the vaccines themselves rather than blocking them and limiting supply.
6906,"The longer the entire world goes unvaccinated, the longer the opportunity for more variants to pop up and spread."
6907,We're currently staring down poorer countries not being vaccinated until 2024.

6916,Yeah I think people are expecting us to wake up and everything be back to normal because the shut down was basically overnight but opening up is harder because you need to be cautious
6917,"&gt;Justice added that vaccines would be offered at the state basketball tournament in Charleston, via the Kanawha-Charleston Health Department, and likely would be added through mobile units at fairs, festivals and other events."
6918,So many great moves in this article.
6919,Love it.
6920,I think some of them are enjoying it in a weird way.
6921,They‚Äôre going to lose their moral superiority feeling when we start loosening restrictions.
6922,Im saying its a hint at what Cuomo is thinking.
6923,CA is talking about all restrictions being gone June 15th.
6924,NY is talking about restrictions on August 18
6925,Preprint articles require a higher degree of scrutiny and rigor to accurately evaluate than many other types of articles.

6934,Thankyou very much!
6935,Post-mortem question here on Covid management efforts by State governments.
6936,Can anyone explain to me the logic behind deciding that allowing bars/restaurants to reopen (e.g.
6937,at more than 50% capacity) was a good idea?
6938,Even with 'masks' - before everyone sits down to eat and drink for 90+% of their time there.
6939,Was there truly any discussion of economic impact vs. health impacts?
6940,P.S.
6941,"I have a background in bioaerosol science and respiratory protection, and I certainly can't figure this one out..."
6942,I‚Äôve already booked plane tickets and accommodations for December a few weeks back.
6943,"Gotta do it before the floodgate bursts open, to get good prices."
6944,"That was an awful idea, since alcohol interferes with the immune response."
6945,Unless it was an alcohol free beer?
6946,This is a good point.
6947,People really don‚Äôt understand the efficacy rate and what it means.
6948,"It‚Äôs even more helpful to look at breakthrough infections, as that‚Äôs what the OP of this comment thread is concerned with: they‚Äôre occurring at rates between 0.005 and 0.007%."
6949,"That is insanely low, and certainly not worth worrying about."
6950,"I have had health anxiety/panic disorder for 20 years, so I‚Äôm familiar with the thought processes."
6951,I would worry about having a stroke from all the anxiety before I‚Äôd worry about catching a symptomatic case of COVID once I‚Äôm fully vaccinated.
6952,That‚Äôs just *nuts*.
6953,[removed]
6954,Anecdotal examples are not data.
6955,Hope everyone is ok but the science shows outdoor risk is low
6956,Israel was smarter than everyone else.
6957,They would not vaccinate people who already had Covid and were thus immune.
6958,So when they were at 55% vaccinated they were at around 70% overall immunity once you add in the 15% of the population who already survived Covid.
6959,If USA had that policy and shared those extra doses rather than wasting them on people who already had Covid Canada could be in good shape instead of sitting at 3% fully vaccinated right now.
6960,Over 30M people in the US have had Covid and while they may need a booster shot sometime in the next year or three that's enough to vaccinate Canada's entire adult population.
6961,We don't know how long immunity will last but the pandemic went worldwide 14+ months ago and even with the new variants Covid reinfection remains very rare and serious illness from Covid reinfection remains several orders of magnitude lower than even the best vaccine performance seen in real world results so far.
6962,There are many problems with the worldwide vaccine rollout but the easiest thing we could have fixed would have been to avoid wasting any vaccine doses on people who already had Covid at least until reinfections causing serious illness start to pop up which isn't a problem yet.
6963,Nothing is worse than Twitter
6964,[removed]
6965,What do you all think Florida will look like two weeks from now as far as cases go?
6966,You think cases will fall dramatically as compared to now?
6967,"Idk as long as things are open and I can do whatever activities I want, I don‚Äôt really care if they make me wear a mask inside places."
6968,"It‚Äòs dumb but at this point, but just getting to travel is huge."
6969,Are you sure about those numbers?
6970,"Italy had 7,3 milion doses planned for Q2"
6971,"I want a vacation too, and to visit family, but I‚Äôm not stupid and inconsiderate so I don‚Äôt."
6972,Zero sympathy for those who make bad choices and then have to face the consequences.
6973,A primtive country ruled by elites with immense inequality which has been continuously at war for decades commiting war crimes across the world?
6974,Oh wait wrong country.
6975,Please do!
6976,I really want to visit Vancouver again!
6977,Yes
6978,That's a horrible line of logic for a restriction to stay in place.
6979,People don't get that social statistics are almost irrelevant by the time they're published.
6980,The inputs vary way too much.

6982,i want to go to italy in September and ive got the $7000 in flight credits for my brother and me to prove it!
6983,I think it's pretty normal for deliveries to be this low on the weekends.
6984,"Tuesday tends to be the biggest delivery day, IIRC."
6985,I support vax and masks (where appropriate).
6986,"If you're on the move outdoors, you ain't getting infected walking by another person, even if that person is sick."
6987,It's not gonna happen.
6988,It's a number's game and a few hundred million covids are not gonna do it.
6989,"A few billion, perhaps."
6990,Lot's of people in small indoor spaces is an entirely diff story.
6991,"Wear a mask among strangers indoors, for sure."
6992,"Nope, he‚Äôs asking if the 16+ population alone can carry us to at least 50% of our total pop."
6993,I have a family member getting married in a few months.
6994,"Everyone in my extended family is fully vaccinated except for the kids that are too young, of which there are only 2."
6995,And they are both being breast fed by fully vaccinated mothers so likely are getting some antibodies.
6996,Almost every guest at this wedding will be fully vaccinated.
6997,"My one sister, who is fully vaccinated, won't go."
6998,Why?
6999,"Because we're ""still being told to avoid large crowds."""
7000,I think at this point the anxiety is associated with the activities more than the risk of covid.
7001,Will they even have their own population vaccinated by then?
7002,We know already that a single shot massively reduces the risk of hospitalisation and is very likely to reduce the transmission rate.
7003,"The people saying ""just wear a mask"" or ""distance"" during the flu season aren't looking for it to be voluntary, and those who are anti mask now won't be pro mask later...so reasonable and attainable ideas like yours get shoved to the side while the extremes bicker."

7011,"Still sweaty and greasy, but exuberant."
7012,"Christ, this kind of person is insufferable."
7013,Probably more the fact that the US knows it will have more than enough vaccines than sympathy for what's happening in India.
7014,That's a valid reason to still be very cautious.
7015,We're seeing more and more evidence that vaccinated people are not spreading COVID.
7016,Time to tell vaccinated people they don't need to mask any more.
7017,If people are hugging and in each others faces you're effectively breathing on each other.
7018,It's like a no duh sort of thing.
7019,It's not that you're in the magical territory of immunity.
7020,Life isn't a video game.
7021,Why should they have to if it isn‚Äôt necessary?
7022,Just because you think it‚Äôs fine.
7023,"I don‚Äôt care what your autistic nephew does, sorry."
7024,He‚Äôs not my child.
7025,"We COULD, but we won't because people are too stupid to get the shots, and our government is too incompetent to make people get them."

7030,"They‚Äôre going to end up losing anyway, correct, unless you think the restrictions will last forever?"
7031,"And if you do, you must realize that isn‚Äôt going to happen even if the government tries it because those people will be voted out by the populace and replaced by politicians who will take the opposite approach."
7032,"So the question is, what is different between now and then for these people?"
7033,Nothing.

7038,"I spent a little time there years back and would love to return some time, even emigrate there if I can figure out a work visa."
7039,Prost!
7040,I think a lot of people had that viewpoint last year and were surprised to see them fare so well until now.
7041,Then it's a question of how much of this uptick is attributable to the new strains or just a increase in mass gatherings.
7042,Either way it's collapsing their healthcare system and it's in everyone's best interest if the 2nd most populous country in the world wasn't in a situation where they need mass graves because they don't have enough crematoriums to handle all their dead
7043,I am indeed from the US.
7044,Cause and effect are backwards.
7045,People who are in better physical shape will exercise more because they are in better physical shape.
7046,First dose #s will be super interesting to follow this coming week in light of the J&amp;J return.
7047,Should begin to shine some light much of the recent drop was due to the pause vs. a true decline in demand.
7048,But that‚Äôs the number that matters when trying to get to herd immunity.
7049,Regulators may make a distinction but the virus won‚Äôt.
7050,"Multiple good news stories are on the front page every day, but don't let that get in the way for your confirmation bias."
7051,The problem is there's a huge crossover between the people who don't want to get vaccinated and the people who think that Biden somehow stole the election and Trump will magically become president again.
7052,How do you get Q idiots to actually take this vaccine?
7053,"&gt;pretty common sense

How'd this dude experience the last year while thinking common sense is something Americans have"
7054,Uh this one.
7055,I've been massacred multiple times for saying this months ago.
7056,I even was banned from some other subs for suggesting as such.
7057,The sub has definitely changed its attitude in the last few months.
7058,I'm not sure whether it's because users are getting vaccines or because you-know-who isn't the US president any more.
7059,"There's even an increasing number of people who go to the opposite extreme: in particular, there's a subgroup who are convinced that variants are made up by the media and designed as a form of ""fear-mongering"", and pose no more risk than the form of the virus going around in 2020."
7060,Exactly.

7065,"Hopefully,  it‚Äôs about fully vaccinated and not about country of origin."
7066,(Or at least let fully vaccinated Canadians in too).
7067,I mean the population of India is 20 times the UK.
7068,Whatever the UK sends will inherently seem tiny.
7069,There's no way around that.
7070,&gt;The only way this will make any difference is if the rest of the world (particularly west) do similar.
7071,"Well yeah, exactly."
7072,"The UK can only do its bit, so what's your point?"
7073,It can't control what the rest of the west does.
7074,It can't steal the rest of Europe's ventilators and then donate them.
7075,"Leading by example is the only way, which you apparently have a problem with."
7076,Was everyone 6 feet apart the whole time?
7077,Did anyone shake hands and then touch their face?
7078,"Did anyone hug, kiss, or exchange close face-to-face greetings?"
7079,"If anyone went inside to use the restroom or take food outside, were masks worn the entire time anyone was inside next to anyone else?"
7080,I could keep going but I think you get my point.
7081,There‚Äôs always more to the story than we were all outside.
7082,"Wow, that was a pathetic experience at Walgreens."
7083,I've seen a wide variety of experiences.
7084,"Early on with the health department and my aunt, it was very smooth with the first shot (although it did require time spent on paperwork)."
7085,Second shot however was a circus...
7086,Mom went to Walmart.
7087,Getting the appointment was semi painful as this was when they first opened up in my state and it required tons of reloading.
7088,"However, it decreased paperwork and there were a few questions."
7089,But the whole process took about 30 minutes for the first shot.
7090,The second shot was faster.
7091,I went to CVS.
7092,I had gotten familiar with the site so I knew exactly what to do to get through it.
7093,There were tons of appointments to choose from so I was able to get something soon and it the right time.
7094,I checked in when I got there and they confirmed my identity and sent me back.
7095,I wanted a selfie to commemorate the moment but I was already being ushered behind the curtains to get my shot.
7096,They told me to hang around and leave whenever.
7097,Second shot was mad quick.
7098,And it wasn't crowded it anything either time.
7099,I definitely did like the pharmacy experience because I had an appointment and I didn't have to risk getting to a mass clinic too late after they ran out of shots.
7100,"But by the time my time came up, the mass clinics were getting more availability than people wanting shots so it would have been convenient."
7101,The US has banned flights from India.

7106,"If they had Covid and were fully recovered, it was pretty darn safe."
7107,Definitely as safe as if they were vaccinated seeing as how strong natural immunity is
7108,The injection is extremely quick.
7109,"It‚Äôs also much less painful than, say, an accidental poke from a malfunctioning safety pin."
7110,You‚Äôll barely know anything happened.
7111,Wishing you all the best!
7112,Who is following these recommendations?
7113,You either have states that are red who are dropping restrictions now or you have states that are blue who are basically saying restrictions will be here forever when they claim ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll lift restrictions when we reach herd immunity for a virus the experts say will be endemic‚Äù.
7114,I‚Äôm not sure the CDC‚Äôs words will change either group.
7115,"Although, some have said Illinois will follow the CDC, so that‚Äôs good for them."
7116,Exactly.
7117,Now if Carnival Cruises and Disney make the same requirement..
7118,Not really.
7119,"Here‚Äôs the thing: when the first wave came, the govt initiated a swift lockdown which probably helped really slow down that wave."
7120,"Of course then the government got complacent, but in general they have been taking it seriously, far more seriously than Trump ever did."
7121,"The fact is that in a country like India, no government could have stopped a huge wave such as this."
7122,Man outside of the Daily Discussion this sub is still filled with let's lockdown forever crowd
7123,I think that any country that has over a billion people will be structurally unique in terms of social issues and governance.
7124,"At that point it‚Äôs no longer about population density (e.g., Bangladesh), but raw numbers."

7134,"People can get covid after vaccination, but it is absolutely not the most common outcome once you're exposed."
7135,"Because we're never going to truly get rid of covid, we're going to have to accept that risk now so we can get back to normal."
7136,That's the reality.
7137,Be safe out there!
7138,From the US
7139,But an anecdote?
7140,"Are you advocating that we all wear masks forever, since masking can help prevent other diseases?"
7141,Correct.
7142,The Americans who travel to Europe are already vaccinated.

7155,Being lax on rules ended up being a much worse decision for the Dakotas than it was for Florida and Texas.
7156,"While they should get the 2nd dose, at least one is better than none."

7161,Just a shame it took such a high profile case of catastrophe and people needlessly dying for the USA to stop being so pointlessly selfish.
7162,This could've helped if it was done weeks/months ago.
7163,It does nothing to help India now.
7164,"I don't worry about too many mutations in Florida, no."
7165,The entire world likely won't be vaccinated into herd immunity until late 2022.
7166,"Given how many billions of unvaccinated people exist outside of Florida spreading the virus over the next year, the antivaxxers in Florida are a drop in the bucket."
7167,It just seems like such a small thing to worry about while the world is drowning in spread and mutations right now.
7168,Worst case I have faith in the ability of a quick ramp up of mRNA vaccine boosters targeted for whatever mutations may come out in the future.
7169,I have to believe the world will get to herd immunity through vaccination or this thing will burn out eventually.
7170,Most EU countries are saying by mid-July now.
7171,Fully vaccinated that is.
7172,"Starting May, vaccine supply issues will be a thing of the past."
7173,"Even countries like Norway and Denmark, who have banned AstraZeneca and halted J&amp;J think they will have vaccinated 90% of their population fully by August sometime."
7174,Israel had cases start plummeting at 50% of the population vaccinated.
7175,Using the eligible population in the denominator makes no sense.
7176,The [US](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations) is at 41.46% of the population vaccinated with a first dose.
7177,"The last week has seen 2.74% of the population, or more importantly 4.5% of the unvaccinated population, get vaccinated."
7178,33.7% of the unvaccinated population is ineligible.
7179,Yup because c19 is either an apocalypse or just a spicy flu and not somewhere in between.
7180,Nah we‚Äôre good.
7181,Thanks anyway.
7182,What's the positivity rate of those tested?
7183,Should give an inclining of undertesting.
7184,&gt;This wasn't the site of a hospital.
7185,It wasn't an official government-organised oxygen provider.
7186,This was a voluntary outfit run by the Sikh Khalsa Help International charity.
7187,"&gt;While hospitals in the capital raised the alarm over oxygen running out for the seventh day running, people were racing to volunteers who had managed to source small amounts of oxygen."
7188,"&gt;""I don't know what the government is doing,"" said founder Gurpreet Singh."
7189,"""If we can do this, why can't they?"""
7190,"But what about his *Prime Minister- Simple Corruption And Moneymaking Scheme*, or **""PM-SCAMS""** fund???"
7191,"Surely the money that was donated is helping the Indian people, right?"
7192,(I‚Äôm not an expert or a doctor on the matter).
7193,"Yes, if I‚Äôm being honest."
7194,I don‚Äôt think coronavirus is a problem that‚Äôs going to go away because of a vaccine.
7195,"I think this will be around probably for years to come, kind of like a new flu, but worse."
7196,"I do think they‚Äôll have to make tweaks to the vaccine every couple of years to prevent bad strains, but I believe we should be alright for the next 2 years more or less."
7197,"Every vaccine that comes out, I‚Äôll have to read about it tremendously and see for myself if it‚Äôs safe to take."
7198,Your arm will probably be sore a couple hours afterward but the needle itself you will barely even feel.
7199,Awesome.
7200,I have tickets for July I'm hoping to use
7201,I hope you're right!

7203,"Good luck getting herd immunity in the US, I just can't see 70% of all Americans vaccinated, as fucking stupid as half of the country seems to be."
7204,We're currently at 28%.
7205,Hi this is me too.
7206,I am traumatized forever.
7207,(Also fully vaccinated)
7208,Nice thank hope here not any inconvenience?
7209,If so sorry bro
7210,[removed]
7211,"I think a lot of countries will allow vaccinated tourists pretty soon, the question is how easy will it be to come home?"
7212,I'd love to travel to Europe (once fully vaccinated) but if it means a mandatory hotel quarantine when I get back home then it's not feasible.
7213,Hopefully we can at least send out some of our AZ doses
7214,So pfizer is basically Kool-aid
7215,Any reason anyone should care about your level of excitement?
7216,"It will probably be some sort of S curve, that starts slow, ramps up with increasing speed, and then slows down as the remaining countries have issues that hinder vaccinnation (no infrastructure, war, natural calamities, cultural resistance to vaccinnation, etc.)."
7217,This means that for industrialized countries this target will be reached much sooner.
7218,&gt;My big hurdle will be going to a bar.
7219,I‚Äôm not particularly ‚Äúafraid‚Äù of it; it‚Äôs more a mental thing from being trained to be afraid of such situations for 15 months now.
7220,This is my problem.
7221,"I think it's perfectly safe for someone vaccinated to go to a bar, but the idea has just been so off limits for me that it feels wrong to do."
7222,I got my my 2nd pfizer shot yesterday morning and felt like dogshit from about 5-6 hours afterward until early this afternoon.
7223,Now I feel mostly better other than a sore arm and some overall soreness.
7224,Nothing brutal at all and I'm thrilled to be fully vaccinated.
7225,According to https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/canada-on-solid-footing-in-negotiations-for-more-astrazeneca-vaccines-from-u-s-anand-1.5400404 negotiations with Canada is in progress.

7281,Ireland has had a pretty shitty rollout but we have 99.9% percent of people 80+ vaccinated.
7282,"Yeah, that's not my kinda thing anyway so no harm, no foul if you're right"

7292,This sparks joy.
7293,Exactly.
7294,I have my final crit in person tomorrow and i am petrified lol.
7295,I will do it but afterwards ill be worried for weeks.
7296,Anxiety and the likes are so horrible and weighs on us constantly... i think because people have varying degrees its easily written off by most people because they do not experience the same levels of worry as us.
7297,I literally cannot stop obsessing when something happens.
7298,Its exhausting.
7299,Lifetime
7300,100% concur.
7301,I just got some very thin silk masks so I can mask outdoors in relative comfort without rustling anyone‚Äôs jimmies.
7302,"But as far as I‚Äôm concerned, outdoor masks are pure theater assuming you‚Äôre not in a crowd."
7303,"COVID kills more people in 40 minutes than meningitis in a year, and it can be stopped cold with a vaccine"
7304,"So some guy who choose not to get the vaccine caught Covid

Who cares?"
7305,"They had there chance and they blew it, sure the chances of a variant showing up is there, but what are the actual chances of one showing up that completely resists the vaccine?"
7306,"Far to low to want to drag this out for all eternity

Sure, I understand there will always be those who cannot get it for medical reasons, and while this absolutely sucks this is not the majority and cannot drag this out forever because of them"
7307,Maybe he likes them
7308,It won't be shut down but I doubt clubs will be open and big events will happen.
7309,It will likely be like the East Coast in the US is right now.
7310,"Yeah, I get that, but I mean how many places will be out of business?"
7311,"Irish, but following the UK fairly closely."
7312,"Many seem to be cancelling not because of covid, but because they can't secure insurance."
7313,"I think England's goal of no social distancing by June 21st is a bit too optimistic, but I could see it later in the summer after everyone has at least been offered a vaccine."
7314,"&gt; We've been told 95% for almost a year, why is it 85% now?"
7315,Because you're comparing two different numbers.
7316,You're comparing the efficacy at preventing severe symptoms with the efficacy at preventing transmission.
7317,"Broad numbers we know now for pfizer:

* 80-90% effective at preventing infection and transmission."
7318,"* 95% effective against severe symptoms
* Near 100% (99.9% or more) at preventing hospitalization and death

In short, these numbers are amazing."
7319,The US was ready to approve any vaccine with even a 50% efficacy in *any* of these categories.
7320,I agree.
7321,"I just have loved ones who will not take it and if more people would, we'd be done sooner."
7322,I agree 100% with what you said.
7323,I just don't get how you can be unhappy with all the restrictions and still not get the vaccine.
7324,"Or even worse, in my opinion, want to stay locked down forever and also not want the vaccine"
7325,So then where‚Äôs the CDC guidance?
7326,Feels like he‚Äôs been saying the updated guidelines are coming for a few weeks... Hopefully it comes with Biden‚Äôs 100 days ending

7384,Targeted lockdowns in areas with surges are how lockdowns should work.
7385,We shouldn't lockdown NYC because Michigan is surging but if a state is having extremely large case counts with hospitalizations rising to the point of risking triage then they need to lockdown until they get it under control.

7413,He already did it once and we didn‚Äôt have a surplus back then.

7461,I was thinking about that and was wondering if those who had Covid are more or less likely to be vaccine hesitant?
7462,I could see them being more hesitant since they may have some level of immunity.
7463,I could also see them being less hesitant because they know what covid can do and don't want any chance of getting it again.
7464,I actually agree.
7465,"40% is nowhere near close enough, and even in the overpopulated NYC metro area, vaccine appointments are becoming available in the hundreds every day."
7466,New cases daily are exactly where they were in late February.
7467,"Daily deaths have been dropping about 10% a month, the shining light in the news."
7468,Even if we get to 70% vaccinated it does not seem like the US is reaching herd immunity.
7469,Does this mean that mutations will continue to develop?
7470,Just got my second Moderna shot yesterday.
7471,Just so emotional after this year long stress.
7472,Pretty sure the CDC already said all fully vaccinated people can forgo masks and distancing.
7473,[removed]
7474,I'd think maybe June at the earliest.
7475,Their trials and tests are still supposed to be going on until middle of June.
7476,"I am an indian and the situation here is truly horrible, there are several reasons which mixed together to form a perfect storm."
7477,1.
7478,The government ove rhere still does not want to go through with a complete lockdown which was suggested several weeks ago when the number of cases started to increase once again.
7479,Only because they are scared mor abput the economy than the people who are dying (atleast in my state).
7480,"2.general lack of people following protocol, there are many people who do not really care or understand how bad the situation is, people form packs outside wine shops and drink to there hearts content with everyone present their, and of course to drink they remove their mask, once drunk the minimum amount of distance that they might've maintained is no longer present."
7481,"Due to lack of knowledge some people just dont know why they have to follow what they are doing, things like wearing masks incorrectly or not bothering with it, i have personally seen a guy on a crossroad sneeze inside his mask after which he precedeed to flip his mask inside out and wear it again."
7482,3.
7483,"Panic buys have once again started because its obvious that there will be a lockdown (by common sense, we do not know if there will even be one), this has lead to many people just rushing and buying stuff in bulk to prepare themselves."
7484,"My family has only gone out a handful of times and we always get groceries online which is delivered to our house and then we sanitize them, but due to the shortage of groceries we cannot get them, I cannot go out and get groceries because of how much the spread has increased, I live in a relatively small apartment complex which already has around 10 families which have contracted covid, i cannot take the risk of going out to even get groceries in fear of the elders who live with me might get covid."
7485,"The only saving grace for me is that we have rice which we buy 5kg's at a time which can last us another weak, heres to hoping I amm able to order groceries before that period."
7486,So yeah we need as much help as possible thank you UK!.
7487,"Sorry for my english, formatting and the typos on a phone."

7489,I sure hope not.
7490,That‚Äôs irresponsible.
7491,I don‚Äôt have a fear of getting vaccinated...
7492,I am however sick of taking forced precautions over something with a 99.95% survival rate...
7493,"Oh god that poor guy, that would be terrible."
7494,USA gave them a great example of what not to do.

7498,"Will not really, you have to be able to break down the underlying numbers from the CDC link and average the age range is differently since 65 and up isn't only boomers, so when you average it up it comes out to something closer to 56 or 55% for boomers."
7499,"Gen x is further down, when you average them into the proper age range, then the numbers for them are closer to 46 to 47%."

7521,In a dense crowd there's still a little risk.
7522,And the public health authorities are afraid that if they tell people they can take off their mask in any situation they'll take them off in every situation.
7523,How charming.
7524,"Yes, it‚Äôs not a particularly scientific comparison, but just to communicate to an uninformed person how rare the chance of them experiencing a breakthrough infection is... what‚Äôs a better analogy?"
7525,I‚Äôve seen some people suggesting getting into a car accident is more likely.
7526,Is there *any* comparison that would be apt?
7527,"Do we expect the risk of breakthrough infection to go up over time, as more people are vaccinated (or infected without vaccination)?"
7528,Don't get me wrong.
7529,I would have gladly driven to another state if it meant getting my vaccine a few weeks earlier.
7530,By the time things opened up for me (young with no risk factors) there was an abundance of appointments available on day one.
7531,[deleted]

7549,"&gt;  The UK can only do its bit, so what's your point?"
7550,"That the UK isn't doing it's bit, 500 is a tiny amount and as a country we could supply far more, we just have chose not to."
7551,"looks a lot more like ""might need to scale back"" rather than ""no fun for u"""
7552,Apparently they do because we‚Äôve been trying to send those AZ vaccines to Canada for over a month.
7553,"I know there's nothing I can say to help, but I think it does help me to know I've done everything in my power to be safe and keep those around me safe."

7557,"It's tough, but I wish you the best with tomorrow!"
7558,Well it‚Äôs going to be a mix of the careful ones being vaccinated and a lot of the reckless and irresponsible ones having infection-induced immunity.
7559,[removed]
7560,Then how do you explain the new variants that are coming out which are more infectious and more deadly.
7561,"What's your describing might be what happens in the past, but it's not what's happening now."
7562,"Therefore there is no reason to lambast someone for being concerned given the very real possibility that A variants are coming out and they are more infectious and more severe / deadly, and B that the vaccines are relatively new and we do not know how they will stand up to variants yet."
7563,The number that have had one shot is much higher than that.
7564,28% must be number who have had second shots.
7565,I think u/SPLY750 was referring to outdoor activities.
7566,"For example, golf courses."
7567,The US has already done away with that for domestic travel and you can skip quarantine if exposed.
7568,"The vaccines are so incredibly effective, it would be weird if they made you quarantine."

7590,"While that's true on paper, any such contracts made by private companies become meaningless in the face of governmental authority acting with emergency powers."
7591,The US authorities could just seize the vaccines and arrest anyone from AZ that tried to stop them.

7608,"I knew the risk was extremely low, and I wore a mask when I wasn't alone in the park."
7609,There's definitely layers to people's own risk assessment.
7610,Up until a week or two ago I think it was reasonable for the US to keep this as a reserve.
7611,We saw with J&amp;J that the supply of a vaccine can stop at the drop of a hat.
7612,All it takes is some reported side effects or manufacturing problems.
7613,J&amp;J had both.
7614,"If that happened to Pfizer/Moderna, vaccinations would basically halt in the country."
7615,At this point it is looking like there is more of a surplus.
7616,But there are complicating factors though.
7617,"There are some legal issues because if the US manufactures the vaccine and sends it to someone else and it causes side effects, the US may be liable."
7618,So they want other countries to indemnify.
7619,And I am sure that there is all kinds of political wrangling going on with 30M doses and billions of people that need it.
7620,"I mean how do you decide between Canada, Mexico, India, etc?"
7621,Your closest ally?
7622,The country with the greatest need?
7623,Etc.
7624,These aren't great excuses though and I hope they finally do it soon.

7682,I have a family member in his 80s who survived covid earlier this year.
7683,He got his first dose of pfizer a few weeks ago and had some chest pain and symptoms which mimicked when he had covid.
7684,He has been anxious about getting the second dose which is this week.
7685,We have heart issues that run i.
7686,The family.
7687,His doctor checked him about 5 days or so after he had the pain and didnt find anything of concern.
7688,I assume he is still pretty safe to get his second dose but should we be worried at all?
7689,I scheduled my first shot at a mass vaccination site half an hour away because I wanted the earliest shot available.
7690,"Now that there's more supply, I've scheduled my second at a pharmacy three minutes away."
7691,"Even though I'm getting both of mine *as soon as possible*, I'm technically contributing to the lack of demand for mass vaccination sites."

7714,Good Lord.
7715,"Yeah I remember hearing/reading that not too long ago, don't get me wrong it's still important to get vaccinated and I'm getting my second shots this coming week, I just think that there's a lot of uncertainty and we just need to be cautious and understand more about what's going on."

7787,"That's what it currently stands right now at, for Gen x The date range is from 65 to 80, when you do the same thing for them you get 46%."

7820,"often, a lot less."
7821,"i am unemployed, and the government pays me an unemployment wage of the equivalent of a little over US 15,000 a year."
7822,that much is considered right at the top of Indian middle class.
7823,"so, despite the fact that i do not work, and am technically one step from being homeless, i still make as much money as the richest Middle class Indians."
7824,"if you work, middle class people in my country can make 20-50 times more than an Indian middle class."
7825,"basically, from my perspective, a middle class income in India is a poor persons income from my country."
7826,homeless people literally often make more money than Indian middle class.
7827,so that number being high really doesn't mean anything to other countries because from our perspective its artificially high.

7864,For the Netherlands: everyone partially vaccinated around the first week of July and 2/3rds on the way to having everyone fully vaccinated.
7865,"The thing is, AstraZeneca will not be used by then, so the 12-week interval will not be a problem."
7866,And the mRNA vaccines have a 4-6 week interval.

7870,"After that, it is time for the people under 18, possibly a third (or second for Janssen) booster shot against variants and possibly lots of donations as well (they have already donated quite a lot of funds to COVAX separately and will be donating not needed AstraZeneca deliveries)."

8042,for proving my point.
8043,Sad.
8044,Didn't the governor of Florida make vaccine passports illegal?
8045,Like the state government cannot issue proof of vaccination.
8046,And businesses (like airlines operating Miami International Airport) cannot ask for proof of vaccination.
8047,Ron DeSantis did this so people had more individual freedom.
8048,What are residents of Florida supposed to do now?
8049,Are you okay dude?
8050,Berlin received 7k doses less of Pfizer than it should have this week.
8051,Other states received more than they should have.
8052,"It's all a joke, so I'll believe this increase when I see it as a reality and not wishful thinking."
8053,It should be no school for you.
8054,God doesn't stop the spread.
8055,Ha ha no offense taken.
8056,I am an American and I am seriously worried and praying for you all in India.
8057,"Also worth noting that there's like 9 million J&amp;J doses ready to go, so once all states resume using it we could hit that within a week or two."
8058,"So then couldn‚Äôt we sell them for a paltry sum, like a dollar for all the doses?"
8059,Guess that‚Äôs just Walgreens for ya lol
8060,Selfish... from a Brit.
8061,That's rich.
8062,"I'll bet I can guess her political party, without any other hints."
8063,"I don't know Texas weather but I do know Florida weather... June is when it gets really hot and humid, and people seek A/C and the indoors."
8064,Being on the beach in June feels like being on the surface of Venus.
8065,March/April is springtime there.
8066,So I can see why your observation might have some support.
8067,India has a large population.
8068,They should be more powerful than the US.
8069,Why should people help them over people doing in the USA?
8070,I've been saying that for over a year now.
8071,"lockdown ended for me in June, and I have been going at least 4x per week since then, and not a single covid case was traced back to my gym, despite no one wearing a mask, and my friends who workout in different gyms, not a single case was detected there either."
8072,"I know its anecdotal, but I don't think gyms are breeding grounds for illnesses due how your body heats up during workouts, its not fertile for a virus to infect a burning host lmao"
8073,Taken a lot too.

8097,Carnival so far refuses to say they'll require vaccines.
8098,"And considering the passengers they tend to attract, they should just rename themselves Plague Rat Fiesta if they don't require them."
8099,Nobody is happy to work with the Chinese government.
8100,The difference is that we have effective treatments that are reducing the numver of days the patient stays in the hospital.
8101,This opens up more beds amd let's us hospitalized more people in a given time period.
8102,"As an example, Chicago's first wave had an average stay of 9-11 days."
8103,A hospital with 100 beds full of COVID patients on Day 1 could have the same 100 patients on day 11.
8104,The second wave had an average stay of 7-9 days.
8105,"In this scenario, if all 100 patients on day 1 were out of the hospital on Day 9, there would be 100 beds available to new patients."
8106,"Just because 200 people have been hospitalized on Day 11 does not mean that COVID was twice as bad, just that access to Healthcare had improved."
8107,Defining and interpreting these metrics is extremely complicated.

8128,Glad we have foreign policy experts on Reddit so readily
8129,Vaccine hesitant people are probably the same people who _already_ weren‚Äôt afraid of getting sick or dying.

8154,i haven‚Äôt gone up to visit him because i‚Äôm not vaccinated yet but according to my mom no nurses are wearing masks and they just have one of those thermometers you put against your forehead at the front door but no one is using them.
8155,i hate this state.

8157,Oh no.
8158,Are you somehow able to detect my worrying?!
8159,\*Anxiety intensifies
8160,You understand that everyone has different situations right?
8161,Maybe this guy/woman has a kid with an illness at home that is high risk.
8162,He himself mentions he‚Äôs high risk.
8163,Maybe he‚Äôs SO high risk that the super low odds don‚Äôt make him feel better.
8164,You barely feel the needle.
8165,"Side effects vary pretty dramatically, but mine were extremely mild."
8166,They were more of a minor annoyance than anything.
8167,H.E.B.
8168,may not be the only place that has your immunization record.
8169,Texas has ImmTrac2.
8170,When you received your vaccine you may have signed a form that allowed your vaccination information to be transmitted and stored there.
8171,imagine being stuck here since birth üò™
8172,i think $300 to everyone who can prove they were vaccinated would be fair
8173,62 cases out of 5 million vaccinated in Israel.
8174,"Googles ""myocarditis incidence rate""."
8175,10-20 cases per 100K persons.
8176,It's literally 12X more prevalent in the general population than in Covid vaccine recipients.
8177,"I agree with you, only issue is kids aren't vaccinated and I am reading that some k-12 public schools are requiring masks for their entire 2021/2022 school year - so it's the question, will they lift all mask mandates before the kids can get vaccinated?"
8178,Canada is relatively tiny compared with the EU.
8179,If they got only 1 in 10 of the vaccines that Europe did they would still outpace on vaccination rate.
8180,And they had a very broad spectrum of orders (ordered more than they needed by 50%) and got lucky like the US that the majority of those were the early and successful Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.
8181,"I have them here in the UK, as does a relative in Switzerland."
8182,"Because I don‚Äôt talk to any of them anymore, and we‚Äôre not really friends."
8183,Just people I used to know before COVID.
8184,"I‚Äôm sadly poor, and can‚Äôt afford vacations to warm climates either :("
8185,People just love ranking things because it makes it easier to think without having to use your actual brain.
8186,"It was inevitable that a virtual vaccine tier list would develop, even if it's reductive and overall wrong."
8187,"Just take the shot, jeez."
8188,"That is awesome news, particularly from a state where it looks like people will need some extra encouragement."
8189,"Also, of course this makes sense."
8190,Those employees will be in close contact with patients!
8191,No more shutdowns.
8192,"But we should keep masks and some high risk distancing (crowded bars, mass transit) until cases fall down to negligible or kids can be vaccinated."
8193,I think it‚Äôs all about perspective.
8194,Most of my life has relatively been the same since the pandemic.
8195,"I go out, I work, I attend class in person, I wash my hands, and now the only difference is that I wear a mask and I can‚Äôt shop past 10pm."
8196,I have been exposed to two people who‚Äôve tested positive without either of us having masks on (they are family) and I never once caught the virus from either of them.
8197,I‚Äôm also a young female who seems to be at higher risk for serious side effects.
8198,I also know that none of the trials are over with and there could be side effects that we have no clue about.
8199,"I know the same can be said about the long term effects of covid, but with my history, I feel safer waiting out this vaccine."
8200,"I‚Äôm not denying science, I‚Äôm just judging my own health based on my experience."
8201,Nobody should have the right to tell me what they think is best for me.
8202,Just like I don‚Äôt have the right to tell them what is best for their health.
8203,Remember when Osterholm said by the end of March we'd be entering the worst part of the pandemic?
8204,r/ShitAmericansSay lol
8205,Or it‚Äôs just not that big of a deal to wear a mask when you get used to it.
8206,Guess that‚Äôs a matter of perspective.
8207,They certainly know how to question us on other things....
8208,Brilliant.
8209,Seems like a great idea.
8210,Iam with ya 28 healthy fully vaccinated but still have to wear a mask.
8211,Nobody I know thats my age is even bothering getting a vaccine.
8212,I agree.
8213,Fortunately over the last few weeks I‚Äôve seen more people doing the chin thing and just pulling it up when they pass somebody.
8214,Signs of sanity.
8215,I do know that South Africa will be producing the J&amp;J vaccine for use within the African countries.
8216,India will be producing J&amp;J and Novavax domestically.
8217,The other issue is scaling up the raw materials production since everyone is depending on the same supply chain.
8218,Different checks.
8219,"This is talking about quality control checks, not approval to administer the vaccine."
8220,"The California mandate has numerous exceptions for things like ""Outdoors and maintaining at least 6 feet of social distance from others not in their household""."
8221,"It's actually not that strict if you read it through, but most people don't."
8222,It wasn't related to the public very well.
8223,I continue to get nasty looks when walking outdoors not in crowds where distance is easily maintained.

8245,Pfizer is delivering more and more each month
8246,So are parking fines.
8247,What's your point?
8248,"Got my J&amp;J 24 hours ago, had some pretty bad flu symptoms last night (crazy body aches, chills, 101 degree fever), but feeling better today with the help of Advil."
8249,"If the side effects mean that the immune system is working properly with the vaccine, I don't mind the symptoms!"
8250,There have been tons of indoor gatherings in India for a long time now.
8251,I hear about them daily from coworkers there.

8268,"If you choose to, that is your right, just like it is my right to choose not to."
8269,You got half a million dead and this national selfish attitude has contributed to making that number higher than it need have been.

8274,"if an adult wants to pretend that they‚Äôre vaccinated just to not wear a mask, they‚Äôre not hurting the people that got vaccinated"

8276,A lot of areas drop quick after a spike.
8277,I'm not attempting to be condescending in any way.
8278,Just wanted to give a perspective.
8279,If we only had Pfizer we'd still be trying to vaccinate the 70s-80s right now.
8280,Instead we've done all the priority groups and are down to those aged 44.
8281,"The truth is both AZ and Pfizer are key components of the UK vaccine portfolio but AZ more so, about 11 million brits have had Pfizer compared to around 21 million getting AZ."
8282,Isn't 12-15 going to be approved soon?
8283,Pausing the J&amp;J will have had an effect on this too.
8284,"My dad got the J&amp;J and my stepmom was supposed to get it too, but the pause happened the day before her appointment."
8285,"Now I don't know if she's not vaccinated yet because she is waiting for the J&amp;J to be available again, or if she just couldn't get an appointment for one of the others yet, but as far as I know she still plans on getting vaccinated."
8286,"Yeah, I didn't need a seatbelt when I drove my car yesterday, and I don't need it now."

8290,"Not everyone uses VAMS so if you went to a non VAMS vaccine site, it will not get uploaded to it."
8291,"I can't answer all your questions, but I can answer some of them."
8292,"The J&amp;J pause was after 6.8 million doses given, 15 clots, 3 deaths."
8293,"The US has fully vaccinated 48 million Americans with the Pfizer vaccine at this point, with many more on the way."
8294,That's roughly 10x of the vaccinated population of Israel.
8295,"And despite close monitoring, we haven't seen enough of anything to set off alarm bells at our agencies."
8296,"The only conclusion is that if there really is an effect, it's vanishingly small."
8297,The US government can't make preemptive announcements that everything is fine with the vaccines without making things worse.
8298,Even the the report says that they don't have enough data to make a valid conclusion and recommend continuing vaccination efforts.
8299,That's another reason it's not widely reported.
8300,So much this.
8301,These things are safer than the drive to whatever location the shot is being given (motor vehicle accident).
8302,These things are safer than eating dinner after getting the shot (choking).
8303,These things are safer than showering the night after getting the shot (falls).
8304,Ad nauseum.
8305,"If you are considering not getting vaccinated due to risk, you really need to get some perspective."
8306,There is as close to no risk as no risk gets.

8312,"Non-randomised sample groups like that will not be used for the big trials because it's not a reflection of the broader population, and instead regular testing of non-symptomatic people across a range of ages will be the gold standard for trials in the future, in my view."

8315,I suspect the EU will have considerable difficulty satisfying the court that they've met the standard that their own contract created.
8316,"Simply touting numbers that AZ deliveries fell short isn't going to cut it, they need to demonstrate a behaviour which I doubt is there, but even if it is will be nonetheless difficult to prove."
8317,Should be good to see how this plays out in court though.
8318,Covid costs are fully payed by the U.S. government
8319,"We want a clear signal to mark the end of this, but we're probably stuck with incremental changes."

8327,"Yeah, I feel like these headlines are meant to shame but ... this is not the kind of activity to be shamed; you're outside, you're vaxxed (hopefully), so why would you need to wear a mask while getting rammed down the Millenium Force?"
8328,Well NO DUH
8329,Why not?
8330,UK deaths 25 per day USA deaths 700...
8331,Reopening earlier makes sense.
8332,Medical costs are mostly irrelevant in this case since government isn't really involved in US healthcare.
8333,"It's pretty comical how many headlines existed for NYs ""third wave"" and not a peep about the free fall in every COVID related statistic."
8334,The post wasn't about continuing to wear a mask.
8335,"If that's what you want to do, go nuts."
8336,It was about not going into ANY store if mask mandates are lifted even though they are vaccinated.
8337,&gt; save 30 people of the 3000 that are dying each day.
8338,"Well that‚Äôs just hopeless

It‚Äôs like trying to put out a fire with saliva"
8339,"Okay but just because that's what we should work for, doesn't mean that's where we're at"
8340,Honestly even Reddit has started to come around.
8341,90% of the comments I see on here that are pushing for endless mask mandates and distancing and other precautions are getting downvoted to oblivion.
8342,"Most people are fed up, it seems."

8360,insignificant?)
8361,compared to the odds that that very same person will come to harm -- and then do harm to others -- because they were *not* vaccinated.
8362,"If you weigh the risks and benefits, everyone who can get vaccinated should get vaccinated, and every government should pay its citizens to do so."
8363,It seems to occur more commonly in Covid and we don‚Äôt know how long it will last.
8364,My personal take is to avoid unnecessary risks where the level of risk is non negligible and not quantifiable.
8365,Last summer I sat out of a lot of activities because I wanted to see the data on safety.
8366,Now we learned that those activities were safe and I will engage in them confidently this summer.
8367,"My kids are going to camp this year, for example."
8368,I feel the same on long term risk.
8369,I want to understand the risk before taking it.
8370,"Yea, it's rough."
8371,Hopefully the supply lines firm up.
8372,Here in the US at the start we had Pfizer and Moderna issues with last-minute under deliveries and problems getting things to the states and in arms.
8373,"It cleared itself up after a bit, but these problems look a bit tougher to solve."
8374,I hope they don't prove to be.
8375,Stay strong.
8376,Absolutely.
8377,"In my state, all adults have been eligible for about 5 weeks now."
8378,"If you get sick and die from covid right now in this state, you've basically got no one to blame but yourself."
8379,You directly accepted that risk.
8380,I could see giving it a LITTLE more time to accommodate those who couldn't go get the shot right away for whatever reason.
8381,But as far as I'm concerned we're very close to a point where there's essentially no justification for any restrictions at all.
8382,"A lot of skeptics have been bitching all along (with at least some justification, to be fair) about how there's no defined end to this, and the finish line keeps moving - first it was two weeks to slow the spread, then it was flatten the curve, then it was save the hospitals, then it was get to a low baseline, etc."
8383,"In my opinion, *this* is finally the line in the sand."
8384,This is last call.
8385,"If the option to get the vaccine is widely available to the public, and has been for a month or two, then as far as I'm concerned it's over."
8386,"At that time, 99% of adults fall into one of two groups - the ""got a vaccine and don't need restrictions anymore"" group, and the ""did not get a vaccine and don't want, care, or deserve restrictions anymore"" group."
8387,I really hope this is what the rest of us can expect once we get our vaccinations up.
8388,"Official announcement just says ""Offices will increase from 50% to 75% capacity."""

8390,Because it‚Äôs one of the few states that only allows medical exemptions for vaccines for kids.
8391,No religious or ‚Äúpersonal belief‚Äù exemptions.
8392,"Joining West Virginia with those restrictions are California, New York, Mississippi, and Maine, which is one of the strangest possible group of states you could assemble."
8393, Modi is the leader that Hindu nationalists deserve.
8394,What point are you trying to make?
8395,What are we even arguing about?
8396,"Yeah, I'd be completely on board with another significant stimulus check tied to whether you have been vaccinated yet."
8397,"I think it probably shouldn't come for another couple weeks though, as access to vaccines isn't quite available to everyone yet."
8398,They cant do that legally in any manner.
8399,They cant do it because IP hasn't been released so they don't know how to make it even if they subverted law.

8409,The latter deserves whatever consequences may come from choosing not to get vaccinated against a deadly disease.
8410, Modi is the leader that Hindu nationalists deserve.

8418,*
8419,This.
8420,It kind of depends how much you are nervous about them.
8421,"You are 90 percent less likely to get them sick, good enough odds for most people to live normally with."
8422,Great news.
8423,It would be even greater news if everything is open with no restrictions by then (and no masks).
8424,Any chance of THAT happening?
8425,Imagine going to Greece or Spain in the summer and having to wear a mask.
8426,Don't send money to the PM Care fund.
8427,It's a shady fund with only promises and half assed delivery.
8428,On top of that the fund has multiple times refused to share the details of how the fund is being used.
8429,Totally opaque.
8430,No clarification
8431,&gt; I always felt it was only a matter of time before it turns absolute wildfire there.
8432,That's what happened with the Spanish Flu over there too.
8433,"An estimated 12+ million dead, the worst hit country in the world during that pandemic."
8434,It's rather terrifying to see the trajectory they're on today.
8435,Hopefully enough countries can pitch in to send extra vaccines to them to get it under control relatively quickly.
8436,Of course it should be increasing.
8437,But how can we model that?
8438,Each company has dose goals for the end of 2021.
8439,"But there's no central repository, and I don't think it adds up to 4 billion."
8440,"To be fair all parties were holding massive rallies, not just the BJP."
8441,Yeah that's total BS.
8442,If case rates and hospitalizations aren't bad there shouldn't be any outdoor restrictions whatsoever.
8443,They end up pushing events and parties indoors when they restrict safer outdoor alternatives.
8444,[deleted]
8445,Good luck fellow human.
8446,"I use drive through banking so I don‚Äôt have to wear a mask...the people that come to my job choose to have close personal service...my bartender doesn‚Äôt care...I‚Äôve used self checkout at grocery stores for years...

And the real reason I‚Äôm not getting the vaccine is that it is not worth my time to go get stabbed when it provides me no benefit...Still have to mask up, still have dumb restrictions at bars...still can‚Äôt go to local sporting events...still can‚Äôt cross international borders...

Can still go to work every day with or without vaccine...and I was judged essential so I‚Äôve been working normally for 13 months now...while we all lost a year of our life to save Aunt Edna..."
8447,There is literally nothing in it for me to get stabbed...
8448,Is the situation in India worse than Brazil a couple of weeks ago?
8449,In the interview he says that in the best case scenario the approval could come in as soon as **two** weeks!
8450,I hope next week we'll be getting some sexy efficacy data.
8451,It's really due time at this point.
8452,Yet another good reason not to live in Kansas.
8453,Over what time periods?
8454,I never stopped.
8455,"If a restaurant I liked was open, I went."
8456,Japanese study puts it at 1 out of 19 cases was in some outdoor setting.

8462,Do not leave the house unless you have to.
8463,"If you do go out, wear two masks and a face shield if you have one."
8464,This virus is no joke.
8465,"This was happening before any vaccines were applied, hospitals are thankfully not struggling right now, my point is how one activity which would be much safer in an outdoor venue is restricted where as the indoors events arent restricted, that's just baffling to me"
8466,I have my 2nd dose this week.
8467,A couple more weeks and I‚Äôll likely start occasionally eating inside at restaurants depending on the weather.
8468,dont be scared it will be good!
8469,Tell them that the [CDC recommends against that](https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/communication/steps-healthy-fruits-veggies.html).
8470,&gt; Getting a vaccine at the pharmacy down the street is a lot more convenient than driving downtown to wait in line.
8471,I've had two vaccination experiences: One at Walgreens (went with my mom to get her shot) and one at Wrigley Field.
8472,I much preferred Wrigley Field.
8473,"Walgreens, i didn't feel safe."
8474,"It's not a very big store, and we have to wait in line with other people with varying mask compliance - i think one woman had *active COVID* and was in the store."
8475,We waited an hour while the pharmacist was preparing the vaccines.
8476,"At Wrigley Field, it was lovely."
8477,"We were ushered through a line with  friendly people guiding us; we sat in a circle with a hospital nurse who went over everything with us, and I was out the door in 20 minutes."
8478,Now my experience might not be the same as everyone's but i prefer the mass vaccination site.
8479,I can guarantee that there are no major outbreaks in at least the capital.
8480,Everyone is living like normal minus maybe clubs and the hospital is like normal.
8481,No of my friends in China know anyone that got covid.
8482,You could search vlog China on YouTube to see what it's like.
8483,Yes.
8484,Shows that thankfully some people value lives over grudges.
8485,"I honestly thought this would be me, but once I was fully vacinated I was surprised how quickly I was done with social isolation."
8486,"I have no issues with masks, but I hang out with other vacinated friends now regularly."
8487,I miss people.
8488,No but if you're going to be dishonest in your headline are you shocked that so many media outlets have become less trusted on covid?
8489,"Say ""covid wards are now filled with middle aged patients"" because kids and 20s/30s are still not the ones getting hospitalized in large numbers from covid."
8490,If what they're saying does not match what we're seeing they look dishonest even if they're technically correct.
8491,It's funny how I was downvoted to shit for suggesting banning flights from India just two weeks ago and now everyone else is saying the same exact shit.
8492,I can guarantee that there are no major outbreaks in at least the capital.
8493,Everyone is living like normal minus maybe clubs and the hospital is like normal.
8494,No of my friends in China know anyone that got covid.
8495,You could search vlog China on YouTube to see what it's like.
8496,Fingers crossed that Canada is not too far behind
8497,I hope the US can send J&amp;J one-shot vaccine and ventilators.
8498,It‚Äôs the only way to help.
8499,"Sputnik is gonna be a no from me, lol."
8500,"We had a bit of Pfizer and AZ from Europe, here in Australia."
8501,"We'll be producing AZ soon, but AZ won't achieve herd immunity."
8502,Why wouldn't you assume that it is increasing?
8503,They should be able to get it either next month or in June if I‚Äôm not mistaken.
8504,"Nope, it's a privilege to do so."
8505,And taking every precaution when it comes to this virus is necessary.
8506,"Puerto Rico is accepting people to vacation as is their right, it's just that people need to stay vigilant and not fuck this up for the rest of us."
8507,I have wanted to go back to Canada for a long time but can't because they closed their borders.....I accept that and understand it.
8508,I'm not one of those people who are asshats about not being able to to to europe for the summer (last year) because they closed their borders.... We need to take precautions and do it the right way.
8509,Same thing happened in Michigan.
8510,And it will take hold across the US if they aren't careful.
8511,This doesn‚Äôt seem like an emotional response at all or one purely speculating that those arguing for masks or lockdown or restrictions did it solely for their own enjoyment to control others.
8512,/s
8513,"The most well-known animal reservoir is not bats, it's mink."
8514,"We found the virus can infect them and then jump back to humans and it seems to be extremely contagious to mink, much higher than for humans."
8515,There are also fears the Chinese racoon dog could be a reservoir as it is similar to mink but the Chinese have not been publishing any data on monitoring their populations.
8516,"It has also been shown to infect dogs, cats and many other animal species, though these are considered less worrisome."
8517,"The main fear is the mink, the bats of course, the still unknown intermediary species that first became infected by bats and then passed it to humans in China, and the fact that we don't know whether it may infect other species the same way as mink."
8518,Here is a good [article](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00531-z) about the whole thing.
8519,France is a state though.
8520,"Outside of the US, state refers to Sovereign State, that is, independent."
8521,That‚Äôs sort of up to you.
8522,Is this person close to getting a vaccine?
8523,"No, no, it turns *you* into a Microsoft product."
8524,It'll be a big money saver in the long run when the computer lives inside your body.
8525,Yeah but the US had forethought to buy enough vaxes for everyone so apples example for a country that‚Äôs an orange
8526,"Agree popular Twitter comments are a terrible source of info but this sub was also terrible up until a few months ago, was basically filled with the same type of extremist comments you see from Twitter."
8527,This mentality is still prevalent here today it has just become more mild lately as you mentioned (still rears its head however).
8528,It probably means they're in denial.
8529,"That's nice, but aren't they concerned about new variants that the vaccines don't protect?"
8530,"Yep this is how the UK will reach heard immunity, mostly through vaccinations and the idiots will get it the harder way by actually getting covid."
8531,The moderators on there challenge anyone who posts with a severe reaction.
8532,Just good to know so you understand you aren‚Äôt getting a complete picture of side effects.
8533,I‚Äôve seen them force someone who developed heart issues to provide medical documentation to prove it.

8580,No worries!
8581,It's actually pro-vax--I just want all the information and for things to be as safe and trustworthy as possible (which so far they have been very nicely!
8582,).

8600,There is no way to determine visually who's vaccinated and who isn't.
8601,So what do unvaccinated persons do when they see a bunch of vaccinated persons without masks outdoors?
8602,They assume it's all clear and get complacent with mask wearing.
8603,Not true.
8604,What is almost universally true for every virus on the planet is that they generally mutate into weaker forms to infect more people.
8605,Viruses want to survive and not kill their host before they can reproduce.
8606,"While COVID symptoms might be more severe than your average flu, the mutatations aren't necessarily more serious."
8607,"The virus that cause COVID-19 is just more severe than the flu, but the mutations will generally function in the same exact way."
8608,"Apart from that the flu actually mutates much faster than COVID even though it's not as infectious as COVID, so if we can keep up with the yearly flu vaccine for the yearly flu variant, we'll certainly also be able to keep up with any mutation COVID will throw at us."
8609,"Yes, but not safely."
8610,They ship bales of plastic there to be recycled.

8763,I would disagree.
8764,I don't think 24/7 vaccine clinics are actually that much simpler.
8765,These vaccines are mixed in batches.
8766,Batches that go bad after a relatively short period of time.
8767,"So when running a 24/7 vaccine clinic, you spread out your demand."
8768,You can't just ploap them down anywhere r you'll be either throwing away a lot of doses or having people wait around.
8769,You have to push people together into groups and so I think rather than 24/7 it would just be better to have certain days be late night shifts.
8770,SO one week you go Tuesday and Thursday until midnight and starting at 4 AM and then next week you do MWF for those hours.
8771,Why not?
8772,"Because of your carelessness, someone might get sick enough to want to take a leave but can't because ""it's the cold""

8774,Or throwing stuff in the trash?
8775,They are inconvenient too.
8776,Do you not follow them?
8777,Why should I or anyone else get sick because you feel it's too much to just wear a mask?
8778,Should I blame you for lost wages or in a more serious case if it's the flu or tuberculosis hospital admission or death?
8779,Why should you get sick if someone else decides not to wear a mask and then coughs and sneezes all over?

8963,"I'd recommend one of those pull up masks, I use them all the time and haven't had any irritated ears since"
8964,Goodness help us if we ever have a more deadly pandemic.
8965,The morons will screw the rest of us.
8966,So then when do we stop requiring masks?
8967,"A study in Ireland determined that outside transmission accounted for 0.1% of the cases, and most of those were from large gatherings or contact team sports, and even then they couldn't disentangle the outdoor event from the beers afterward."

8969,Sorry I did not provide any context.
8970,I was speaking from a US perspective.
8971,"We should not stop US flights right now, that would be asinine."
8972,I would also be for banning/limiting flights in from troubled regions of the world like India.
8973,As for some sort of world wide flight grounding - that sounds like a fantasy.
8974,It's like getting HIV from oral sex
8975,&gt; nothing personifies that better than someone walking on a deserted beach or street with a mask on.
8976,Or people are going from indoor location to indoor location and don't feel like taking their mask off just to put it on again a few minutes later
8977,"It's not protecting them, it's protecting the 25% of the population (the immunocompromised and under-16s) who can't get the shots yet, for just a little while longer until approval for kids and herd immunity to take better hold."

8985,The world has obviously learned nothing from this pandemic in the last year plus.
8986,It's actually embarrassing that you lack even basic math skills but you're confidently spouting total rubbish.
8987,You also have a complete misunderstanding about what the purpose of a vaccine actually is.
8988,Did you have a head injury as a kid or just really bad parenting?
8989,"Oh, this one's easy."
8990,"""The fact that other countries are showing mass amounts of deaths from COVID show just how much control (((they))) have over the world."""
8991,Yeah because y'all are super following the tighter restrictions faithfully all the time.
8992,AND ITS STILL GETTING WORSE.
8993,You should just stop.
8994,You seem to be bad at this.
8995,I watched cspan a few years ago where a congress person wanted to know if putting a military base on an island might make it capsize.
8996,"He was serious, I was confused."
8997,How long was HK locked out from the rest of the world?
8998,In America we had partial lock downs for 2 weeks and armed people stormed state capitals because they chipped their nail polish.
8999,"Anecdotally, I had my first shot at walgreens that was far away."
9000,The website was a disaster for rescheduling so I got my second at cvs down the street and canceled my walgreens appointment saying I received my dose elsewhere.
9001,"Now, the phone calls warning me my health is in danger for missing my second dose will not stop."
9002,You'd have to think some of these missed shots are bad record keeping.
9003,We're about half way down on the density list.
9004,"I genuinely don't know why the cases continue to rise, but it seems obvious further restrictions are not the solution."
9005,"Maybe people aren't getting vaccinated, and that's foolish."
9006,"Yea, I don't think so."
9007,Swiss cantons aren't following a strict age priority regime as EU countries but are rather closer to the US' strategy.
9008,The canton of Zurich has been vaccinating people in their 30s or 40s for quite a while now.
9009,"Fauci has to go, he‚Äôs lost all credibility, man fell in love with the limelight."
9010,FRJ
9011,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but I can't believe the CDC didn't adjust their website/publications/guidelines/etc as they gained more and more knowledge about the virus over the past year."

9021,"25th April
New cases: 3,54,653 | Deceased: 2,808"
9022,I hope so too!
9023,I have friends in Vancouver who I‚Äôve been wanting to see.
9024,I'm from Wisconsin.
9025,Everything about him annoys me.
9026,Florida and Texas have not had the toughest restrictions.
9027,They‚Äôve had to enforce some because of their population but I believe states like Michigan would like to talk to you about restrictions
9028,You‚Äôre Chinese property now buddy.
9029,"You can multiply that second integer by a factor of 10,000"
9030,A rash all over that lasted for a couple days.
9031,Nothing too serious luckily.
9032,I disagree with your broader point entirely.
9033,"First, that ‚Äúmotorcycle rally‚Äù was Sturgis."
9034,"It consists of people riding their motorcycles, which happens outdoors, then packing **inside crowded bars**."
9035,Not really an outdoor event.
9036,"Second, the same thing was true of those ‚Äúlarge pool parties.‚Äù  In every example that I read about, people got hot so they would eat/drink/spend time indoors."
9037,"When people actually stayed outdoors, the risk approaches (but can never be exactly equal to) zero."
9038,This has been shown in study after study.
9039,[removed]
9040,They have extra pieces that can be used for Earloop masks to transform them to behind the head masks.
9041,"They make masks fit better for kids, especially the disposable kind."
9042,People aged 43 can book in providing they turn 44 on or before 1st July 2021.
9043,MA is‚Äîit seems to be a New England thing.
9044,Absolutely!
9045,We probably won‚Äôt actually.
9046,The people who were already going out will just do it more because of increased options.
9047,Those who already had bad anxiety are more  likely to fall into the ‚ÄúI still just don‚Äôt feel safe‚Äù bucket.
9048,"The thing is, i absolutely think this is true and i was able to identify some articles here and there when i tried to ease the psychological stress a friend goes through."
9049,"But i scanned through pubmed for peer reviewed reliable sources (not newspaper articles or simple statements of someone, no matter how high in respect or rank), and i found almost nothing, partly apparently because it's extremely hard to track outdoor transmissions and the numbers there are so low that is really hard to establish some reliable statement."
9050,"So my question is, are there real studies showing this?"
9051,"And if yes, could you or anyone else provide a source for that?"
9052,Again.
9053,Peer reviewed and from renown sources.
9054,Babbling of journalists is easy to find
9055,"But, be aware that India does not accept ventilators that are made in China."
9056,Your last point is outrageous.
9057,I‚Äôm not going to wear a mask outdoors to prevent the common cold.
9058,"I will wear one while there‚Äôs a pandemic, but we‚Äôve dealt with the common cold forever without masks."
9059,"Masks make communication difficult, and are a pain in the ass."
9060,"Wearing them during a pandemic is easy, but once this is over I‚Äôm not wearing them for the fucking common cold."
9061,In NJ masks are only required outdoors where social distancing is impossible (like a concert)
9062,"Massachusetts, though they aren't really enforcing it."
9063,Because people don't listen to them.
9064,Also texas has the highest restrictions???
9065,"Lest time my friends told me from there, the only place for the last about month they had to wear a mask was to the hospital."
9066,"The restrictions lifted, but yea I wonder why the cases are rising."
9067,I had a group of medical professionals telling me that the vaccine has not yet proven to reduce transmission.
9068,\*Facepalm\*
9069,It‚Äôs not stupid.
9070,I think the problem here is outside could mean so many things.
9071,Am I going for a walk by myself?
9072,Am I at a croweded out door party or concert?
9073,The signs in our area have always said wear a mask or socially distance.
9074,"Somehow that word or has gotten lost along the way but that‚Äôs been policy from the beginning that I‚Äôve known and followed

I‚Äôve respectfully worn if there were a large amount of people because I was being respectful."
9075,"I‚Äôve also traveled to Asia where it‚Äôs a common practice - out doors and I get that there are possible benefits
It‚Äôs just a mask."
9076,It‚Äôs not like someone was strapping a 200 pound weight to my face which you‚Äôd think was the case when you hear people complain about it
9077,india has the highest rate per capita of asthma in the world ...
9078,Same here!
9079,It‚Äôs very annoying to have my glasses got up while walking while wearing a mask
9080,"I cans see dense cities requiring it, but not states."
9081,...and yet all studies that have been completed show similar results.
9082,In order to transmit you need both proximity and TIME.
9083,In the recent Italian study they estimate that you would need to be having a face to face conversation with someone in close proximity for 15 minutes before it became a real risk.
9084,Stop beating the fear drum.
9085,It takes away any credibility when describing REAL threats.
9086,A large amount of Congress actually *is* very dumb.
9087,"Over the past ~25-30 years especially, it has just become a position for rich/connected people that get recruited and propped up by even wealthier people and do their bidding once they get to Washington."
9088,"They get elected and do their time, then either lose or retire to become lobbyists, sit on corporate boards, work at think tanks (that are slush funds for the same people who bankrolled their elections), etc."
9089,and become wealthier than they were before being elected to office.
9090,Exactly.
9091,My mom is a doctor at a famous hospital in the Midwest and her floor had about a 25% opt out by the nurses/other doctors back in December/January.
9092,You mean like Texas and Florida?
9093,"We've had the tightest restrictions and yet numbers are getting worse, so the answer is to tighten them further?"

9109,What about indoors?
9110,"I'm not an expert by any means, but if I understand correctly we tend to keep resistance to viruses rather than immunity."
9111,Our immune system retains the training it has had to produce antibodies when needed.
9112,"It seems to me that ""herd immunity"" is a red herring - we will never eradicate COVID-19, but we will reach the point where it is a endemic, seasonal flu-style virus that comes around every winter and we recommend that high-risk populations get annual boosters for."
9113,"People will catch it every winter, but due to our prior exposures through previous infections or vaccinations, it will not become a deadly pandemic but an annual inconvenience."
9114,I dunno about all outdoor wearing.
9115,But my state still mandates outdoor mask wearing in outdoor businesses.

9125,"In regard to vaccines, over 140 million have been exported from the EU, which I don't have a problem with."
9126,It's a global pandemic and the solution has to be global as well.
9127,"But when the most vulnerable demographics are vaccinated, then the people most likely to be hospitalized and to die are the least likely to get the virus."
9128,This equals less strain on the health care system.
9129,The health care workers‚Äîwho are usually prioritized for vaccines‚Äîalso deserve the choice.
9130,Do they want to send their kids to school?
9131,Do they want to go to a restaurant or a wedding?
9132,"I got a $50 ticket in Newport, RI in November for not wearing a mask on the street"
9133,And they‚Äôre doing fine too.
9134,He didn't say he didn't wear the mask.
9135,He said he didn't LIKE wearing the mask.
9136,I have never and would never consider going in public without a mask during the pandemic.
9137,It doesn't mean I enjoy it.
9138,In fact I fucking hate it.
9139,I can't wait to be done with this shit.
9140,This is also true in most of the US.
9141,The loudest voices are those in areas where they've been forced to do this.
9142,Some areas where it kind of made sense (before we knew) like dense cities.
9143,But also apparently California.
9144,But most of the US has had either no real mask mandate or the mandate has been for indoor public spaces.
9145,But boiling

9152,***You won't die***.
9153,That's the point.
9154,So many people don't understand how viral infections work.
9155,And the GOP is propagating ignorance.
9156,Why do you care if anyone else is vaccinated as long as you are?
9157,The same reason you care that your allies have strong armies even though you have one.
9158,"Viruses can attack in large enough numbers to overtake your immune system, even if your immune system has the pre-primed knowledge of the virus."
9159,"We need more pre-primed immune systems to defeat this enemy, not open, unprotected systems that allow the virus to gain strength and overrun even vaccinated people."
9160,Ditto.
9161,I have an aunt in the same situation.
9162,Phizer vaccine got serious hives and other allergic symptoms.
9163,Her doctor told her not to get the second.
9164,Marrow is delicious though.
9165,Nothing about the Covid restrictions is delicious.
9166,Lower compared to indoors.
9167,"Also there aren't any good prospective controlled studies detailing outdoor spread due to plenty of confounding factors like density, uv exposure, airflow etc."
9168,Studies showing outdoor spread have been retrospective and their results have been mixed thanks because of a mix of people both wearing and not wearing masks and the inability to point out the origin of spread.
9169,Also all outdoor areas are not equal.
9170,Being outdoors by myself alone is extremely safe.

9177,I wonder why people think this guy is a flip-flopping fraud?
9178,"He‚Äôs just saying...

‚ÄúGet the vaccine..."
9179,"But, continue to socially distance and wear a mask, as you can still catch a cold virus, and you can still pass that cold virus onto others.‚Äù 

It‚Äôs all perfectly logical, right?"
9180,What states are actually mandating outdoor mask wearing?
9181,Fauci is always months behind in telling the truth about a lot of things.
9182,Plus bathrooms.
9183,This is 100pct correct.
9184,Fauci catches a lot of heat for the way he‚Äôs used his words but he‚Äôs tried to be as broad as possible in his role as a public health official.
9185,"He knows he‚Äôs not a policy maker but knows that policy makers may rely on his comments and that the public also hear his comments
But in that official role he must rely on the data and reports that they‚Äôve selected to influence their opinion
Even when they didn‚Äôt say masks helped you as much as they helped everyone else- people sort of figured it out - but they had select data that they wanted finalized before they made that claim
That‚Äôs simply how this works."
9186,But a segment of the impatient population has hung him on his changing word.
9187,The fact that he‚Äôs been out there since day 1 too has possible not helped his cause because he now has millions of sound bytes that‚Äôll be used out of context to discredit him.
9188,"In short, he‚Äôs trying to provide cautious guidance."
9189,And that‚Äôs never going to be everyone‚Äôs cup of tea but it‚Äôs what he feels his job should be
9190,"In England, ages 45-49 are currently being vaccinated, age 44 can now book appointments, ages 40-43 will be making appts within days."
9191,Some local areas are slightly ahead or behind of this.
9192,Well this will be a great way to get Republicans to wear masks.
9193,They'll reliably do the opposite of whatever Fauci says.
9194,I still have no idea why they hate him so much
9195,Tell them they can start banging there 2nd cousin on spring break in Cabo because they both were ‚Äútotally drunk‚Äù and ‚Äújust trying to relax before spring finals‚Äù AGAIN
9196,"I‚Äôm fully aware of that, I was moreso asking about if the rest of us vaxxed were in the clear or what steps we should now take"
9197,No shit!
9198,So glad I live somewhere where no one has worn a mask outdoor for months.
9199,Uh what?
9200,"A 1 in 100,000 chance of getting myocarditis is a greatly reduced rate."
9201,"The normal rate of myocarditis is 10-20 per 100,000."
9202,"If the rate is 1 in 100,000 after vaccination then that‚Äôs means it‚Äôs lesson common with vaccination then without."
9203,The article literally says it will be difficult to determine if the vaccine causes this do to the fact that a vast variety of viruses can cause myocarditis (including Covid)
9204,Depends on which part of the West you‚Äôre talking about.
9205,Some states probably still have rigorous mask mandates or some type of mask culture going on while others never really had anything other than wearing one indoors.
9206,"Most people I‚Äôve seen at the park or in common sense, outdoor areas that are perfect social distancing areas have not worn a mask while any place where tight knit groups are inevitable have masks galore."
9207,I feel even when the big discussion on indoor masks finally starts getting to this point division will still arise.
9208,"Some will be so happy to not have to wear one in a store, but then others may just wear one simply because of the habits people remembered of old before Covid."
9209,"Habits like someone sneezing everywhere down the isle or right behind you in line, someone coughing, etc."
9210,"It will probably be scary seeing people do that as you never know now if they are doing that because of a cold, the flu, or now Covid."
9211,Before Covid the assumption was probably a cold.
9212,Now I‚Äôm thinking people will avoid those coughing or sneezing like the plague even if they‚Äôre already vaccinated.
9213,I truly do not know how Dr. Fauci has kept his head from exploding over the last two years.
9214,"The levels of stupidity,  denial, and plain, pig headed, obstinacy he‚Äôs contended with are *legendary*."
9215,Which studies?
9216,Got a link?

9227,It's understandable tbh
9228,Right but what stuck in the mud absolute BOZO is honestly still clinging to some Trump-infested CDC memo that they quickly walked back?
9229,No one with a brain in 2021.
9230,They‚Äôd either have to be living under a rock or just completely 100% brainwashed.
9231,Not sure which would be worse tbh...

9233,Yeah it's dumb.
9234,"I don't care where you are from, what color your skin is or what religion you believe in, if your country is on the brink of collapse because of COVID there is no way in hell I won't be advocating for travel bans."

9236,It might take me a while to get comfortable with that.
9237,"Maybe after a few weeks or months seeing these events in the news and no reports of an outbreak, which is what's expected, I may venture out."
9238,How does a security person at target know your vaccinated when you're walking down the hall?
9239,"Until there are enough vaccinated people to hit herd immunity, we all need to wear masks because it's impossible to tell who's vaccinated at a glance, which would make enforcement impossible, which would result in millions of anti Vax anti makers walking around and spreading it."
9240,"I really wish the US were producing more vaccines we have the technology, but we're not using it because we're so focused on ourselves and letting the rest of the world go to shit."
9241,We need to at least double our production.
9242,At the current rate of worldwide vaccine production we will never beat COVID because it will mutate faster than we can vaccinate.
9243,"1st world might be fine, but poor countries are screwed."
9244,For the 18-30 range it should have been messages about ending the pandemic for everyone.
9245,"We need you to get the vaccine because although you may not be at a big risk for severe disease, someone else is and you are a vector."
9246,No one likes living like 2020 so why not do your part to end it?
9247,"Don't muddy it up by having to insist ""that they are still at risk too"" that is true to a certain extent but at this point the number of people who you are going to convince with that line of reasoning is in the single digits."
9248,Outdoor transmission was always low.
9249,It has nothing to do with vaccines.
9250,"Instead of shaking hands, we spit in each other‚Äôs mouths as a form of hello"
9251,"My scout troop camps entire weekends comete with hiking, campfires and games and we are required to wear masks outside for the entire time."
9252,"If you are out of the tent, you are wearing a mask unless eating away from others."
9253,We do it because that‚Äôs the guidelines we have to follow.
9254,It would be nice to be able to stop doing this but I‚Äôm always impressed how well the kids comply and don‚Äôt complain.
9255,It‚Äôs the adults that are the issue.
9256,They would help to compensate some of AZ's fuck up in deliveries
9257,Miniscule sounds like the right amount of risk
9258,"I hope mask wearing becomes common practice in tightly confined spaces where a lot of people are such as planes, trains and buses."
9259,Other than that I don‚Äôt have a problem with people going maskless pretty soon

9278,Literally bearing your state‚Äôs name.
9279,No I'm implying refusing to wear a mask in the thick of the worst of the pandemic are the same people who refuse to be vaccinated.
9280,And those same people would still never wear a mask.
9281,Thus the South is just going to keep spanking itself and it's not my problem at this point.
9282,"As someone who is looking into grad programs in the Netherlands and the UK, I'm looking forward to touring potential schools at the end of this year"
9283,I am not one of these people
9284,"No worries, i received the J&amp;J vaccine."
9285,"Im overweight for sure but not like dramatically so and not enough to be eligible for a vaccine back when they were in phase 1. other than that i dont think i‚Äôd be super predisposed to a bad reaction, im under 30 and don‚Äôt eat terrible so yeah."
9286,I likely got it in an indoor restaurant where I spent over an hour without a mask and it wasn‚Äôt a particularly slow night or that big of a place.
9287,"5 days later I was symptomatic, so i can feel pretty confident thats where I got sick"
9288,"Nah, we're assholes, but we're pretty upfront about it."
9289,People don't do fake nice nearly as much.

9298,Don't spend too much time on worrying about things that can't be controlled.
9299,If that's possible then it's not a problem.
9300,I was worried reading the headline.
9301,A lot of international students could then get vaccinated years before they could in their home countries.
9302,They actually buy it.
9303,You think developing countries are paying for plastic waste to be shipped over so they can burn it for shits and giggles?
9304,And it costs over a thousand dollars per container to ship something from the US West Coast to Asia.
9305,Absolutely no one is doing that in preference to landfilling it to save money.
9306,"Some of it is landfilled and burned in developing nations because it's contaminated, or unrecyclable, and because of a high volume of this type of waste, China banned imports of the post-consumer plastic."
9307,But poor countries are certainly not buying plastic waste for funsies.
9308,I feel like a lot of people in this conversation really don‚Äôt have an understanding of what it‚Äôs like to ‚Äúall be in it together‚Äù and I‚Äôd bet most of them don‚Äôt have kids.
9309,It‚Äôs a different mindset.
9310,The maskless morons who marched through London assaulting the police and hurling abuse at people in masks should be forced to watch videos from India
9311,Medical exemptions are one reason why herd immunity is so vital.
9312,Any kind of outbreak is a huge risk to those people.
9313,"So of course they should be allowed in, and they should also probably have the option to continue school remotely until this is good and well over."
9314,"As for religious exemptions, it reminds me that at least 172 children died from easily curable diseases between 1975 and 1995 due to Christian Science and other faith healing organizations."
9315,Forgive me if I don't have a ton of respect for these cults.
9316,"And I have equally little respect for the people who cry ""religious exemption"" because they read some anti-vax nonsense at Google University and think they've found a way to get out of it by lying about their religion."
9317,"There is court precedent in the U.S. for public health overriding private religious conviction when it comes to vaccines, but I doubt most institutions -- even private ones -- want to pick a big fight about it and would rather just cater to the tiny number of people who insist God has exempted them from reality."

9319,it will be interesting to see how it plays out if we don't have full FDA approval when school starts and some state schools still require it.
9320,I think we'll see quite a few lawsuits and I'm not entirely sure what side will win.
9321,I'm guessing the schools will allow the students remote learning as an alternative so they won't lose in a lawsuit.
9322,How do you wrestle with fear?

9390,"There is a locked one now, not sure if it‚Äôs the same as the one I visited before."
9391,From what I gathered the risk reduction is at best 1/20 (95%) for infections in general for vaccinated versus unvaccinated.

9433,It sounded like you were pretty much trying to find someone to tell you not to go.
9434,There's no point if you know it will be unpleasant.
9435,I think your alternative plan sounds fine.
9436,That is pretty dumb.
9437,"I see no reason to remove any symptom like this from the list, when this is clearly a blood disease and can cause all sorts of random symptoms."
9438,"But one takeaway was how both cases were seemingly very mild, so that's good."
9439,My biggest question is whether the vaccine will prevent long term symptoms and issues that even mild cases have resulted in.
9440,"As a graduate student who is losing my mind due to online classes and enforced isolation, I would rather drop my program than deal with another year like this."
9441,"For undergrads living on campus, it is much worse."
9442,COVID outbreaks at colleges = COVID outbreaks in the surrounding communities (including high risk people) = deaths.
9443,"Vaccines don't eliminate COVID entirely, but they drastically reduce the spread."
9444,"Without them, we have no choice but to keep following these policies which are absolutely destroying the mental health of students, the quality of their education, and the budgets of universities."
9445,"From a logical standpoint, requiring vaccinations is the perfect solution."

9457,"That‚Äôs why the next best choice are Canada, Mexico, and Central America."
9458,&gt; But there are complicating factors though.
9459,"There are some legal issues because if the US manufactures the vaccine and sends it to someone else and it causes side effects, the US may be liable."
9460,So they want other countries to indemnify.
9461,That‚Äôs why they loaned the 4m doses to Canada and Mexico in March.
9462,"They made it explicit it was a loan, because that‚Äôs the only way they could workaround the contracts."
9463,"Plus, in May, the next doses that are received from Pfizer, are not under the no-export clause."

9471,there is literally mountains of evidence that the mrna vaccines are highly effective after one dose.
9472,the whole ‚Äòfully vaccinated‚Äô thing is totally arbitrary and is only based on the fact that they were tested with a dose regime
9473,Why is this all happening so suddenly?
9474,That‚Äôs wrong and complete bullshit.
9475,There are plenty of people who one reason or another can‚Äôt get vaccinated.
9476,Secondly (this one might be tough for someone like you to understand) the longer covid is around the more variants are going to occur.
9477,Variants that may get around current vaccinations.
9478,Anyways people too stupid or foolish to get vaccinated will eventually find it too complicated.
9479,"Work places, schools, airline will make it very painful."
9480,Eventually even the selfish dumbasses will give up.
9481,"Well, the UK doesn't really have the supply chain to provide a meaningful quantity of jabs to the world."

9489,So that's not Pfizer and Moderna losing profits.
9490,So nothing that I said is contradictory.
9491,3.
9492,There are other vaccines that are not Pfizer or Moderna such as the Sputnik and Novavax which have been shown to be effective.
9493,"So the market will have more vaccines available soon enough, and they'll be able to get them for a cheaper price."
9494,"Irrelevant really, since a large wave in India threatens the whole world, as illustrated by the new Indian variant."

9498,"Any oxygen concentrator is likely to help, although it's no miracle cure."

9531,India was helping other nations first because the current situation was unexpected and the PM was keen on building international relations.
9532,"All that was good but then the govt really messed up by doing election rallies and kumbh mela and stuff, people were really careless..then the virus mutated..and the 2nd wave overwhelmed India."
9533,Another fault from the govt was they did not ramp up the vaccine production capacity last year.
9534,The whole world knew last year itself that the 2nd wave would come but the govt overlooked it.
9535,"I tested positive this week and got J&amp;J as well, my gf got Moderna and got her second shot a week ago."
9536,"We were both exposed at the same time, as of now she hasn‚Äôt developed any symptoms and we‚Äôve been isolated together since last Sunday."
9537,So id bet the Pfizer puts in work for ya.
9538,1.3% of Thailand has been vaccinated.
9539,They're having an outbreak for the same reason the rest of Asia is:   new lineages are more contagious and edge out their previously successful attempts to contain spread.
9540,Your weird agenda would do better on another thread.
9541,I'm still going to go to bars and restaurants when I'm fully vaccinated.
9542,The chance of me getting sick or giving the sickness to anyone is so low that it doesn't really matter.
9543,"A lot of government guidance doesn‚Äôt really have a huge effect, it‚Äôs just a lot of social pressure holding things in place, but CDC guidelines actually do have a big effect on a lot of places, for better or for worse."
9544,I‚Äôm really hoping they‚Äôre not too overly cautious in the coming months as too many places directly cite the CDC as where they base their rules from and when we have numbers getting really low I don‚Äôt want to have to go too long while the CDC drags behind.
9545,"America already requires [these 3 vaccines to visit](https://www.londonvaccinationclinic.co.uk/travel-vaccinations-for/americas/usa/), why shouldn't we add one more and why shouldn't other countries do the same?"
9546,They're going to need vaccines one way or another.
9547,I'm not sure the world collectively could cough up the 1 billion spare vaccines that India needs.
9548,I think the areas with high vaccine hesitation have more natural immunity though.
9549,The issue is once you tell people who are vaccinated they can ditch the mask every denialist and crank will use that as an excuse to stop wearing a mask without getting it (muh HIPAA)
9550,To whom should I pray?
9551,Yeah?
9552,"So everyone can feel safe going to the Beach, right?"
9553,Eating at the restaurants.
9554,Are you vaccinated at least?
9555,It will slow the next spike if you are.
9556,Weird complaining.
9557,"The admin is investing in vaccine production, PPE, raw materials and more."
9558,Sure it has been on the works to figure out the exact areas of collaboration.
9559,COVID is not going to be stopped overnight and requires a thoughtful and effective partnership.
9560,"Also, remember COVID is spiking in many parts of the US as well"
9561,Seems like research that should be done.
9562,Many countries may have to mix and match
9563,"My husband had this exact thing happen, and we're in the US."
9564,"He is under 30, was not sick and had not been sick aside from the second dose pfizer."
9565,He has no other heart issues (confirmed by the battery of tests they did).
9566,He was in the hospital for almost a week.
9567,I commented about it in this subreddit before (you can find it in my history).
9568,It was determined it was caused by his 2nd pfizer dose.
9569,I believe they sent information on to the CDC.
9570,"I say believe, as they said they would, but we never got a confirmation."
9571,I agree.
9572,I‚Äôve had mods here delete my posts at least twice for also suggesting seasonality affects as ‚Äúmisinformation‚Äù.
9573,I got covid from a restaurant and ive been fully vaccinated for 6 weeks.
9574,They‚Äôre not wrong to continue to be cautious in clearly risky settings.
9575,Zero correlation
9576,Not much of a view with your head in the sand.
9577,"That means it's 16% effective within the first four weeks - actually much better than [AZ, which had a negative efficacy in the same period according to its cumulative incidence curve](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/963928/UKPAR_COVID_19_Vaccine_AstraZeneca_23.02.2021.pdf)."
9578,It doesn't tell us anything about what happens after week 4 if you do not get the second dose.
9579,It's even possible that delaying the second dose would give better results - as happens with AZ.
9580,Go get a pcr.
9581,I tested positive this week with just nasal congestion and ive been fully vaccinated for 6 weeks.
9582,"I can taste but its definitely super diminished, same with smell."
9583,"You could certainly have covid, infact its probable considering covid is by far the most prevalent illness out there right now."
9584,Saying the V word will get you downvotes in these parts.
9585,"Haven't you heard, covid is over."
9586,About everyone in the United States is able to do whatever they want with friends and family already.
9587,"What needs to move forward is things out of people‚Äôs direct control, like masks in places, capacity limits, places being closed, events being cancelled, etc etc."
9588,"for those things, it‚Äôs basically a game of ‚Äúwhen will I not be making everyone hate me if I open up fully‚Äù but once one place does it it‚Äôs gonna have a domino effect."
9589,These things will be quicker to open in some states than others.
9590,But I‚Äôd say July 4 onwards is when we‚Äôll be in the area of not having to do anything and having everything be optional.
9591,"Which is great, I‚Äôm not trying to undersell that."
9592,"But there are gonna be people after that who are still getting over the intense paranoia they built up over the last year and a half, you‚Äôre still gonna have a few people who are refusing the vaccine or refusing to live life normally."
9593,"Well there aren‚Äôt any political rallies going around, nor is there a Holliday coming near that would cause massive mass gatherings."
9594,Yes Memorial Day is at the end of May but it‚Äôs never been the kind of thing that causes people to stand on top of one another.
9595,"Idk, if there is any time to end outdoor mask mandates, summer seems to be the time to do it."
9596,Hi are you referring to the John's Hopkins study?
9597,Keep in mind this is only analyzing antibody response and not vaccine efficacy.
9598,"So yes while we still need to take the same precautions, we also need to wait for more data."
9599,Antibodies may not be the be the full story for efficacy.
9600,"Yup

And then they'll complain about the BJP IT cell downvoting their heavily upvoted comments and posts as if the cells give 2 shits about reddit lol"
9601,Don‚Äôt worry.
9602,That Super Bowl surge should happen *annnnnnnnyyyyy* day now.
9603,"and thats fine, but after covid just dont ask others to wear a mask...thats where the disconnect here is."
9604,"i see tons of people mentioning how they're still going to wear them, but as soon as someone says they dont plan to it suddenly needs to be mandated."
9605,Pakistani born and raised in the US here.
9606,I was never a fan of the Partition along religious lines in the first place (another topic for another day) but just wanna let you know that me and plenty of others like me are hoping the best for our neighbors.

9614,I think that depends on things like the local infection rates.
9615,"If you really really want to end up like India, we can still get there."
9616,"All it takes is enough new people getting infected and a new resistant strain to develop and we move backwards, back toward square one."

9621,"&gt; Fully vaccinated individuals should feel confident in the protection they have received, she said, but should still wear their masks in public and avoid big groups of unmasked people."
9622,This quote from the article feels like the appropriate middle ground.
9623,"You shouldn't be paralyzed with fear, but you also shouldn't be completely blas√© about the risks quite yet."
9624,"Personally, since I'm vaccinated, I'm less paranoid about sanitizing shopping carts and don't shuffle away when someone passes within my 6 foot bubble."
9625,"But I also can't imagine being out in public without a mask, not for another few months."

9635,Still waiting for them to get up and going in Europe.
9636,Getting in a car and driving is substantially more risky than getting covid as a 14 year old.
9637,Need to start examining risk here.
9638,Just found out my father had a similiar response a week after his 2nd dose.
9639,He was ok after a week!!!
9640,Thanks everyone for replying!
9641,All I said was fully vaccinated people can safely gather without masks and distancing.
9642,I NEVER mentioned the SIZE of the gathering.
9643,I would appreciate it if you stop twisting my words.
9644,"Sure, I did not qualify my post with the SIZE of the gathering, but it was not for malicious intent."
9645,I simply did not recall all the details of the guidelines I heard on radio awhile ago.
9646,"post covid, which is what we're talking about, why should I?"
9647,you simply don't have a right to mandate mask wearing past covid...why do you think you do?
9648,"Unless it is properly filtered, shared HVAC can spread airborne viruses."
9649,Ditto hallways; New Zealand proved that with a quarantine hotel.
9650,The EU exporting half of our vaccines is a big reason for why we're taking longer.
9651,"But if we try to put in any sort of export restrictions, we're accused of vaccine nationalism."
9652,Wtf?
9653,Who has 80 metric tonnes of oxygen just lying around?
9654,"Heard more or less the same thing, though not at a gym."
9655,"Could you elaborate on what ""rental allowance"" means in this context?"
9656,The risk is still being indoors with lots of other people and not knowing who is vaccinated or not.
9657,Many areas of the country have pretty low vaccine numbers like Texas and Las Vegas.
9658,"Vegas, for instance, is 23.6% vaccinated according to app.powerbigov.us"
9659,"Sorry, yeah worded improperly."
9660,This was always the subreddit for the overly cautious people so I like to come here for opinions about safety every now and then

9662,Paging Dr Osterholm... when‚Äôs the hurricane tsunami coming?
9663,?
9664,"The language keeps saying ""students""."
9665,No mention of faculty and staff so you have to dive into each university and see.
9666,I know Duke is requiring only students but faculty is optional.
9667,It's probably due to each states labor laws and employee rights.

9672,"Or, they might feel they have to wait for scientific evidence before they say something is ok to do."
9673,That could look like feet dragging to the rest of us.
9674,"That is frustrating, because the mRNA vaccines are easily the best against the variants."
9675,"Although really, anything is better than nothing right now."
9676,"Yep, that to be honest is really the only measure that I see staying in place for the long term."
9677,I just wonder whether some states will actually do it though.
9678,Be optimistic but also realistic is the word
9679,This is why covid has become endemic.
9680,Covid is far from over.
9681,Wouldn‚Äôt it be ok for other fully vaccinated people to interact with your kids?
9682,I thought that was acceptable.
9683,"Of course, it‚Äôs your decision."
9684,"You know whether you can go to another country is up to them, and the vast majority will require you to be vaccinated or fork out $200 for a test."

9686,I really can't see that with such self-centered views.

9689,"Also, picking a fight with a company that brings a lot of jobs and tourism to your state is bad PR."
9690,And medical personnel and hospital beds.
9691,Their hospitals are being overwhelmed and it's only going to get worse.
9692,"Was the US blocking export of ingredients that were in surplus, and in excess of what was needed for US domestic vaccine production?"
9693,It's crazy if the US was blocking exports of supplies that weren't needed for domestic production.
9694,"On the other hand, if exports will slow down US domestic vaccine production then it's insane to allow exports."
9695,I did read our sequencing is now best in the world or at least on par.
9696,If we keep that up (sequencing x percentage of all pos tests) at least we will be able to keep tabs on variants
9697,"Seems like countries are taking their turns on covid, ultimately in the long run those with the most strick enforcement on vaccines will win, and those with voluntary vaccines policies will suffer chronic outbreaks."
9698,Agreed.
9699,"Ironically, the person I replied to attributed the CDC in their statement that attendance at large gatherings is OK for vaccinated people."
9700,"If people are misquoting or misunderstanding the guidance, I can see why these organizations are losing credibility."
9701,"The largest misinformation was the ""two weeks to flatten the curve"" campaign."
9702,"With a 2-week period of presymtpomatic and asymptomatic spread, this was a mathematical impossibility."
9703,I also remember the food shortage and that there was no way we were going to be able to stock up for a month of lockdown.
9704,"There is also this gem from the Who in January 2020:

9713,COVID has given me such a great excuse to be antisocial
9714,"Haven‚Äôt seen any actual science on that, have you?"
9715,So am I the only one that noticed that the only 3 decimal digit is 69.420?
9716,I think once all the dust settles we‚Äôll have enough data to know whether the second dose was actually necessary.
9717,I salute these volunteers for science!
9718,He‚Äôs saying there are no benefits...
9719,The thing is we really should reach 80% vaccinated in all demographics.

9724,Yeah it doesn‚Äôt help that I look generally healthy and unless you met me during a flare up or looked at my medicine cabinet you wouldn‚Äôt know.
9725,But yeah I don‚Äôt wanna have to play the bubble boy card and many times this pandemic I felt put into those kinds of situations.
9726,Poor countries don't need all this symbolic and lobbyist ‚Äúhelp‚Äù.
9727,We need FULL support from all the fucking world and institutions!.
9728,What's happening in poor countries right now is CRITICAL!.
9729,Not only because of the virus also because of the economic chaos that will come.
9730,"At this point, I can see the wealthy countries barricading their borders and shooting people seeking food and help."
9731,This pandemic will put an end to the global capitalism and abusive system or will wipe us all.
9732,"They already are churning out AZ vaccines as fast as they can but they have 1.4B people and spent most of the year giving vaccines away to other countries because their politicians believed they beat COVID

They have a new [Novavax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novavax_COVID-19_vaccine) vaccine under going trials that required materials on the US restricted export list, so India's ruling party have decided to use it as a scapegoat for their current situation despite it obviously not having anything do with it."

9737,[A more recent publication in JAMA is showing a much lower number at 0.6%.
9738,](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2777308) So that's much less scary.
9739,But this is how science works.
9740,"You do studies, and then you do more studies to confirm over time."
9741,Your level of alarm scales with the degree of unknowns in the threat.
9742,"It wasn't ""the sub freaking out"" it was people reacting to data in real time."
9743,And now we have more data.
9744,"Shaming people for reading the research and saying ""I knew better than everybody"" doesn't help."
9745,"Problem is oxygen, ventilators alone won‚Äôt help much"
9746,"no, many are missing but its standard for sunday"
9747,source?
9748,What an asshole.
9749,"If there's \~380 million people in the US, and you assume every single one got the vaccine, and also assuming every single one was also exposed to the virus, then you've got a maximum number of 19 million breakthrough cases... 19 million people who will get infected despite the vaccine (max)."
9750,"More than likely, though, that % is much lower that 95%, because not everyone will be exposed (and 95% = 95x lower chance of getting in), which means more like &lt;100k breakthroughs, probably more inline with 30-40k breakthrough cases."
9751,Expected.
9752,"So hearing people talk about ""all the breakthrough cases that are happening""... it's frustrating."
9753,"Well, yeah, of course there's breakthrough cases - no vaccine is 100% perfect!"
9754,That's exactly what's expected to happen.
9755,"And except for people who have other serious health conditions - the immunocompromised, transplant recipients, etc."
9756,- it's exceedingly rare that any breakthrough case will be serious or result in death.

9813,I actually kind of get this rationale.
9814,The vaccines are currently under EUA simply because there's no approved option AND because the benefits outweigh the risks.
9815,But the EUA isn't nuance enough with the breakdown by demographic.

9838,"Even if you could come here, it would be the worst vacation, unless things turn around fast."
9839,"&gt; Yes, but you are not choosing between injecting yourself with the vaccine or injecting yourself with COVID

In a way you are, since you will get covid eventually if you don't vaccinate and herd immunity is not reached."

9849,"This is a complete failure by the Indian government, they had over a year to prepare for this, since they lucked out in the first wave."
9850,The Indian government should be ashamed.
9851,&gt;India sent more than 50% of vaccines produced to other countries in first few months of this year at ridiculously lower price than Western options.
9852,"That was a business contract, and if you don't believe that, why would a self-sufficient India vaccinate others before its own people?"
9853,"&amp;#x200B;

9860,"&gt; What's your describing might be what happens in the past, but it's not what's happening now."
9861,Again it's not true.
9862,While some of the known mutations so far might be more infectious there are no peer-reviewed evidence that any of those mutations are deadlier.
9863,"They are just more deadly because they are more infectious, which means more people get sick -&gt; less room in hospitals and thus more people die because they can't get treated, it doesn't mean the actual virus is more deadly."
9864,Just saw something about a new variant discovered in Sri Lanka in the last couple days.

9878,"And it was an integrated program with cooperative group projects with the video, broadcasting, and graphic design students, so it's not like you could just work solo all the time."
9879,A requirement for graduation even required that we assist/have an assistant on two projects that the school was contracted for.

9916,"I don't necessarily doubt your conclusion, but I'm just wondering why it is then that Governor Whitmer asked the federal government to allocate more vaccines to them."
9917,Presumably that would only work if Michigan was having a lack of supply.
9918,"Perhaps the answer is that the Governor really wants to avoid the unpopular lockdowns (so unpopular that they caused people to plot to kidnap her and put her on ""trial"") and so made a grand gesture asking the federal government for more vaccines to make it look like she was searching for a solution, even if that solution wouldn't have been very effective."

The guy whose messaging on mask wearing has an extremely sketchy history that includes lying to the public early on to make sure masks were available to health workers is now telling us again that masks aren't necessary when a potentially deadlier third wave could be coming from India."
9967,We have less than 1/3 of the US vaccinated.
9968,"As the article states, demand for the vaccine has dropped here."

10111,Only 0.2 percent of doses have been administered in low-income countries.
10112,&gt;Israel is far ahead of much of the world in vaccinations: More than half of the population is now fully vaccinated.
10113,"In Britain, where a highly contagious and deadly variant was discovered, nearly two thirds of the population is at least partly vaccinated and the rate of new cases is now among the lowest in Europe."
10114,&gt;The United States has also partly vaccinated about 41 percent of its population and has loosened a ban on the export of raw materials for vaccines to help India control the world‚Äôs worst outbreak.
10115,"&gt;India is recording more than a third of all new global cases each day, averaging more than 260,000 new daily cases over the past week."
10116,"The country‚Äôs sudden surge, driven by the spread of a newer variant, is casting increasing doubt on the official death toll of nearly 200,000, with more than 2,000 people dying every day."
10117,"&gt;Experts say the official numbers, however staggering, represent just a part of the virus‚Äôs spread, with hospitals overwhelmed and lacking critical supplies like oxygen."
10118,"&gt;India is home to the Serum Institute of India, the world‚Äôs largest vaccine maker."
10119,But only about 8.6 percent of India‚Äôs population has received at least one shot of a vaccine.
10120,Its surge led to the Indian government‚Äôs decision to withhold exports of doses that many low- and middle-income countries were relying on.
10121,"The vaccine rollout in Africa, which was already slower than it is in any other continent, could soon come to a near halt because of the suspension."
10122,&gt;Public health experts say the number of global cases is most likely surging because more contagious virus variants are spreading just as people are starting to let their guards down.
10123,"&gt;In Thailand, where cases were kept at bay for months with strict quarantines and lockdowns, the virus has spread rapidly, in part by unmasked people partying."
10124,"Daily cases, still low by global standards, have increased from 26 on April 1 to more than 2,000 three weeks later."
10125,"And in India, many people stopped taking precautions after officials eased a lockdown that was imposed early last year."
10126,"&gt;‚ÄùIndia let their guard down when the numbers fell and they thought they were over their last peak,‚Äù said Barry Bloom, a research professor and former dean of the Harvard T.H."
10127,Chan School of Public Health.
10128,"He added that the United States should ‚Äútake a lesson from other countries before we become complacent and decide everything‚Äôs OK.‚Äù

&gt;As bad as India‚Äôs situation is, the numbers have room to grow worse: Its daily caseloads, adjusted for its huge population, rank well below other countries‚Äô."
10129,&gt;The rate of new cases in the United States is falling but remains alarmingly high ‚Äî similar to last summer‚Äôs surge.
10130,&gt;The rates of new coronavirus cases also remain high across much of South America.
10131,"In Brazil, reported cases are starting to drop but remain high after a more contagious variant tore through the country and overwhelmed hospitals."
10132,"&gt;In Europe, the pace of vaccinations lags that in the United States and Canada, and the number of new coronavirus cases remains particularly high in France, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden."
10133,"Turkey, at the crossroads between Europe, the Middle East and Asia, is another hot spot."
10134,"&gt;Dr. Robert Murphy, the executive director of the Institute for Global Health at Northwestern University, said the United States had a responsibility to send unused vaccine doses to other countries as supplies increase."
10135,"&gt;‚ÄùWe have to start thinking on a global scale and do what we can to help these other countries,‚Äù Dr. Murphy said."
10136,"‚ÄúOtherwise we‚Äôre never going to put out the whole fire.‚Äù

‚Äî Kenneth Chang and Madeleine Ngo"
10137,"People should get vaccinated, but not because of some bullshit about different variants."
10138,And the amount of people who are allergic to vaccines is so insignificant it‚Äôs not worth using as an argument.
10139,Right but let's not pretend EU countries will adapt to supply not being an issue.
10140,"I live in Germany and, even if they had enough vaccines to vaccinate everyone twice, they'd still insist that all 36 year olds get vaccinated before 35 year olds are offered appointments."
10141,What's about to happen is the botte neck is going to shift from supply being the issue to good ole bureaucracy slowing everything down for no good reason.
10142,Medical waste.
10143,Probably incinirated.
10144,Straws are a nonissue.
10145,Most of the plastic waste in the oceans are old fishing lines and such.
10146,Like 45% of it all.
10147,Straws are like 0.03%
10148,"Good, thank you for your sincerity, I did the same research too."
10149,I was mistaken about the scale.
10150,What I found was in 3/4th of these cases they've included an image or allegation that the government says is untrue.
10151,"Like an image from 2019 being passed off as from now, or an image from Maharashtra being passed off as from Gujarat."
10152,The other 25% are genuinely honest  criticism with no ground for removal.
10153,I have said earlier in many comments here that this sort of removal is wrong.
10154,"On any day there must be thousands of tweets critical of any government or PM, I honestly don't understand what they were thinking by cherry picking just 23, other than inviting exactly this kind of shaming."
10155,"I'm really glad you did the research btw, thank you for correcting me"
10156,Medical waste.
10157,Probably incinirated.
10158,so is their chance of suffering severe covid
10159,I agree but it‚Äôs going to happen.
10160,"People will either need a passport or have to wear a mask, be tested etc   
There is no way around it, is there ?"
10161,I don‚Äôt get your point.
10162,How is saying everyone who can be vaccinated should be fear mongering?
10163,"https://yalehealth.yale.edu/yale-covid-19-vaccine-program/who-should-and-shouldnt-get-covid-19-vaccine

People with anaphylaxis to any of the components shouldn‚Äôt get it."
10164,It may not work on people with autoimmune issues.
10165,People may now take it for religious reasons.
10166,There may be other reasons for people not to take.
10167,Please explain how suggesting that people who don‚Äôt take it just because they are lazy is somehow fear mongering.

10173,"Dude, they don't want to hear this."
10174,They are not exactly proud of that era.
10175,P.s thankyou for helping us because our government won't.
10176,"I'm kind of confused that the PM of India imposed a massive lockdown relatively swiftly in March of last year, when Covid had just started to hit everywhere."
10177,"But now, facing the worst outbreak the world has seen from this pandemic, no lockdown?"
10178,"I guess the damage may be done by now but by the first week of April, it was pretty clear that India was gonna get hit with a second wave but the Government seemingly didn't really do much to prepare for it."
10179,S
10180,What was his reaction?
10181,OG SARS outta nowhere
10182,My gp in Frankfurt said he suspects people like me to be able to get the Vax end may/early June (34m no conditions).
10183,"I already flew back to us and got it a month earlier but like I always predicted, eu would be 3 months behind the US."
10184,It is EUROPE after all.
10185,India is where covid 2021 will appear i feel unfortunately
10186,"‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have COVID here‚Äù
- India two months ago"
10187,I don‚Äôt like large indoor crowds anyways so I‚Äôm fine with waiting on that.
10188,"Agree with all you points, and on top it's ridiculous that people keep talking about vaccine-willingness polls as if they represent the reality we live in today."
10189,"People are still waiting to be able to make appointments, we're still vaccinating millions of people a day - dropping all mask mandates (and other measures) now is premature"
10190,"As a Vancouver resident, I really miss Seattle"
10191,"It is, my mistake."
10192,"The ""refuse to get vaccinated"" and ""am planning a European vacation"" circles on the venn diagram are probably barely touching."
10193,&gt; I don't understand why people don't like the mass vaccination sites.
10194,Really?
10195,Did you try to understand it?
10196,Hint: its not really hard to get.
10197,Okay those numbers are a little better.
10198,Was concerned that 6k was a pretty regular number.
10199,Glad to see them ramping up there.
10200,There‚Äôs currently a study observing college students.
10201,"It just started a month ago, I believe, and is to run 5 months."
10202,Too bad it couldn‚Äôt go longer.
10203,"They will get it when colleges require it, or music festivals, or their potential work place."
10204,No argument was ever won by laying out facts.
10205,You win arguments by creating an emotional connection between the idea and the person.
10206,"The right is really good at this, the left is abysmal at it."
10207," No, absolutely not you can‚Äôt equate emergency use and FDA approved."
10208,You can‚Äôt continue to lie to yourself but that is definitely not the case and these terms are used in this manner to encompass their mode of use.
10209,I get it you‚Äôre scared and fed up but can‚Äôt muster up the courage to oppose this blatant charade.
10210,The least you can do is pipe down and not criticize people who oppose boundless coercion.
10211,and it not only did it hurt JJ but it hurt vaccines in general too.
10212,Great series this weekend.
10213,Maybe these ‚Äúdodgers‚Äù should know stadiums are adding fully vaxxed sections.
10214,I literally told you that I can't look at it because I don't have access.
10215,You claim that you do.
10216,"I asked for you to quote the specific section of the article that backs up your point, since you apparently have access."
10217,Online University is not back to normal.
10218,Got my second Moderna shot yesterday and it kicked my ass.
10219,"Fever up to 100.5, the worst body aches I've ever had (worse than the ones I got when I actually had COVID), and chills."
10220,My fever is gone but I still have mild body aches.
10221,It's all worth it to be fully vaccinated though!
10222,So happy.
10223,"I also just found out that 69 year old, vaccine hesitant dad with heart problems got his J&amp;J shot a few weeks ago, so my whole family (parents, grandma, aunts) is vaccinated now."
10224,What a relief.
10225,"Yeah, I had an uncle try that line: ""only a tiny percent actually die of Covid!"""
10226,"So I asked him what percent he thought that was, and he replied ""1%""."
10227,"Great, so you think it's fine that 20 times the number of people dying on 9/11 is okay?"
10228,To which he told me to stop being disrespectful.
10229,[removed]
10230,Variants is actually a really good reason to get the vaccine.
10231,The more it spreads the higher likelihood that we get a new variant that actually evades vaccines.
10232,Mr fauci needs to go away... he‚Äôs not helping anything with his new found celebrity...

10236,"Aka ""way more of you will die and suffer from unchecked covid-19"" actually."
10237,[removed]
10238,I got the J&amp;J vaccine on March 5th.
10239,That night I had the typical flu like symptoms that I slept off and felt 100% fine the next morning.
10240,Perfectly fine ever since.
10241,I am a 33 year old female with an intracranial hypertensive disorder.
10242,And I‚Äôm perfectly fine.
10243,This is going to be such an unfortunate waste of a good vaccine.
10244,Of course it has but it hasn‚Äôt always been so explicitly controlled by corporate interests.
10245,My nephew got his J&amp;J shot well before the 'pause'.
10246,Not one problem of course.
10247,One and done.
10248,You‚Äôre literally commenting on a news article about the number of deaths...
10249,The fact that there were more cases at the time of the J+J trials should not be relevant.
10250,That‚Äôs why there is a control group.
10251,"When people bring this up, I just assume they don‚Äôt know what they are talking about."
10252,"The difference in variants circulating is real, though it seems unlikely to fully explain the difference in efficacy, especially now that we have some more recent real world data that backs up the 90%+ efficacy number, even with at least the UK variant."
10253,"That being said, the clotting issue is irrelevent and shouldn‚Äôt be a concern, and I know a number of lower risk people who still want J+J for convenience reasons."
10254,Ironically in that case the cold (and cold meds) may actually be the cause of death.

10263,I'll be at a windy beach and everyone is wearing masks.
10264,"Literally zero chance of transmission, but you gotta wear a mask because everyone is paranoid and you don't want to be the asshole not wearing a mask :p

It's hard to show ""I'm not wearing a mask because there's virtually no transmission risk in this situation"" vs ""I'm not wearing a mask because I'm a dick"""
10265,"It's honestly scary that people see the data coming out of Florida and Texas and don't rethink anything, but instead double down on masks and lockdowns."

10267,"I was listening to the radio yesterday when one of those ""covid ads"" came on saying something along the lines of ""because wearing a mask IS the new normal""."
10268,No.
10269,That messaging is disastrous
10270,Language!
10271,There are still many reasons why they should get it.
10272,1.
10273,**You‚Äôre still at risk**.
10274,Young people do die and get hospitalized.
10275,There may also be long-term side effects to deal with.
10276,2.
10277,**Others can‚Äôt vaccinate and you put them at higher risk**.
10278,Kids and people with health conditions that can‚Äôt vaccinate depend on you for herd immunity.
10279,3.
10280,**Mutations**.
10281,The more it spreads the greater the risk of mutations that can evade our vaccines or be more deadly.
10282,4.
10283,**Prolonging the pandemic**.
10284,"Shutdowns, masking, social distancing, and all the other things that wrecked your past year are at risk of continuing if you allow it to continue to spread."
10285,"I tried this but was instantly met with, ""Do you know how many 'babies' are killed every year because of abortion?"""
10286,Most people would assume through basic common sense that outside in this specific case means social interaction with other people.
10287,It‚Äôs awful.
10288,My husband just got off a phone call that included a Brazilian colleague.
10289,They said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hoping me and my family will get the vaccine by the end of this year or beginning of next year‚Äù.
10290,I‚Äôm in the same boat and I will be heavily pushing to stay remote at least a portion of the week.
10291,Even the folks in student activities can easily do their administrative duties from home and just come to campus to run events.
10292,"There‚Äôs no reason any of us, even ‚Äústudent facing‚Äù folks can‚Äôt maintain some level of WFH and get the campus pretty much back to normal."
10293,I‚Äôve literally been told we have to come back in so the office doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúlook‚Äù empty ...
10294,I really hope other employees fight it too.
10295,"Getting vaccinated might not change your life, but it might change someone else‚Äôs life."
10296,"Plus if everyone thinks like you, they might change your life."
10297,I‚Äôm thinking some poor immune compromised anti-vaxxer out there who serves as a virus factory and give the world a new variant.
10298,I hope whoever funds the antivax disinfo realizes that viruses can cross borders.
10299,We‚Äôre so screwed.
10300,"It‚Äôs interesting how, essentially after mid-January, we were fine with the honor system when it came to signing up for vaccines."
10301,"We knew there would be some line-jumping, but it was easier to just trust people rather than verify."
10302,Why is it that we can‚Äôt trust people when it comes to loosening restrictions for vaccinated people?
10303,"Every day on Twitter I see people saying ‚Äúwe can‚Äôt let our guard down at all because people will lie about being vaccinated to _____.‚Äù

At some point, we are going to have to just trust people."
10304,Am I going to have to submit a negative covid test and wear a mask to go to a Mets game in late June?
10305,"Indoors and on public transit yes, I get it."
10306,"Outdoors and not crotch to crotch, forget that."
10307,"I think Pfizer is well on the way to being approved for children, so it's likely we'll go down that route."
10308,That's why I really feel.
10309,"""those people"" have lost the right to share their opinions....and more than that their opinions are a danger to the general public and I'd like them silenced."
10310,"Wow, 167K deaths from COVID in only three months of the Biden Administration."
10311,What an absolute failure he's been.
10312,The CDC and other organizations say they did.
10313,"That doesn‚Äôt necessarily make it true, but for you to really believe they‚Äôre lying, there should be a decent amount of evidence to show it."
10314,What makes you think they‚Äôre lying?
10315,They thought it would get big headlines across the country and millions of eyeballs on their ads and they were right unfortunately.
10316,Sometimes in life we just have to accept that we cannot change some people and collectively doing the greater good will swoop them up too.
10317,"Honestly AZ loses no matter what

They lost EU as a customer."
10318,[removed]
10319,Vaccines that receive EUA are considered experimental until the FDA formally approves it.
10320,"It is possible that a rare side effect will be found after mass vaccination allows a longer term of observation on a larger number of people, but most side effects are picked up in the first several months after vaccination."
10321,[removed]
10322,The crazy part is that Wisconsin has been doing great with vaccinations.
10323,And the Senator's suggestionthat we should vaccinate the weak has already happened.
10324,That's why high-risk people were able to get the vaccine first.
10325,"His comments, as is tradition with him, make no sense, and are wildly misleading."
10326,"I've found you have to be really precise with it, to not get fogging."
10327,"Top band can't be too high, and bottom band can't be too low."
10328,"&gt;  Because people don't understand we're still dealing with a lot of unknowns it is impossible to give a clear answer

There's a line between trying to predict the unknown and declaring the obvious."
10329,I feel that the CDC is so scared of calling something incorrectly that they refuse to say anything unless its 100% certain.
10330,"It was literally only a couple of weeks ago that the CDC said that vaccinated people could get together safely, which is pretty fucking obvious to anyone with a modicum of common sense."

10332,UAE deaths are so low they almost can not be traced.
10333,I'd call that a win in my book.
10334,Mixed feelings with this outcome.
10335,On one hand the best scientists and workers are working their asses off to save humanity.
10336,On the other hand these are the exact regulatory and legal systems put into place to prevent big pharma screwing us over.

10339,Just because it is the same shape does not mean that it retains its functional properties though.
10340,"In a fully assembled virion, the spike protein facilities the fusion of the viral and cellular membranes after it has initially binded to ACE2."
10341,"However, the spikes from the vaccines have nothing attached."
10342,"And even then, the spike protein has to exit the cell intact somehow."
10343,I found [this video](https://youtu.be/9EfToFXwx98) to be very informative about this exact topic.
10344,"There may be some people left at that point, plus eventually we may have to look into vaccinating children."
10345,"Would be nice to get a 4th vaccine going though, still waiting on J+J and Novavax approval."
10346,Whataboutisms are all you got.
10347,Spreading misinformation during a pandemic should be illegal.
10348,Grow up
10349,"Yeah well the news media is constantly telling us that J&amp;J is dangerous for blood clots and/or the latest flavor varent will ""break through"" single dose vaccines easy."
10350,There are polls out showing the massive damage the apparently anti vax news media has done to single dose vaccines in America.
10351,"Awesome, so happy for you!"
10352,I‚Äôm confused I thought we were worried about the variants spreading?
10353,"It is but it kind of makes sense, with the underlying theme for both being fear of the unknown/fear of anything or anyone ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù."
10354,Yes we are vaccinating under 40s.
10355,Im 29 and had mine yesterday.
10356,I know a dozen or so people in my area around the same age that have had theirs or are having it this week.
10357,I know this; I lived in Des Moines for most of my life.
10358,"That said, the rest of the state absolutely wished we could carve off the northwest and give it to South Dakota."
10359,"&gt; out of 87 million fully vaccinated, only 5,079 symptomatic breakthrough infections."
10360,That‚Äôs 0.005%.
10361,That's highly misleading.
10362,"I'll give you an example to show why:

Say that I'm one of those people for whom the vaccine offers no protection, and I just became ""fully vaccinated"" yesterday."
10363,Lets say that I eventually get COVID 4 months from now.
10364,"Well, for the next 4 months you would count me as someone who is protected by the vaccine even though I'm not."
10365,"In short, over time we should expect the numbers to move towards the trial numbers (95% effective for serious symptoms)."
10366,"Obviously, this is not counting the protection from less community spread of the virus, and that is going to be very protective, but that's a different discussion."
10367,[removed]
10368,So why protect them?
10369,They‚Äôve had the chance to get the vaccine and chose not to.
10370,"That‚Äôs their personal choice, but we shouldn‚Äôt suffer for it."
10371,Let the rest of society move on.
10372,"Seriously, it couldn‚Äôt be much more simple to understand people just chose not too because the issue became politicized"

10411,About 12 of my mates of the same age got the letter on the same day.
10412,ü§£ you brainwashed Muppets eat psyops for breakfast.
10413,what are the numbers of lives they've saved.?
10414,88 people that took the vaccine got covid and died.
10415,That's just the ones that have been reported .
10416,I see that the government and woke culture is going to require americas population to inject an EXPERIMENTAL VACCINE/ vaccine passport in order to get back to some sort of normalcy.
10417,That doesn't mean they are saving lives it means they want you to believe that they are saving lives.
10418,Covid death rate for people under 70 is 99.96 .
10419,We‚Äôre all 6 weeks away from India if the remaining 50% don‚Äôt get vaccinated.
10420,The vaccinated won‚Äôt be hospitalized so there‚Äôs that.
10421,But if it rips through the remaining unvaccinated population still could be significant hospitalization numbers plus variants
10422,That pause sure was worth it!

10448,This is what happened to me.
10449,They wouldn‚Äôt give me my 2nd dose at the hospital Friday because of the rash and hives I‚Äôve had since the first dose.
10450,"I‚Äôm allergic to everything‚Äîfoods, chemicals, and medications, so I‚Äôm not surprised that my body didn‚Äôt like it."
10451,Its still really annoying to be 3.5 weeks out from it and still covered with itchy bumps.
10452,"I‚Äôve had Covid already, so the 1st dose should have acted like a 2nd dose for me, but I‚Äôm nervous about what only being partially vaccinated means for me when it comes to places requiring vaccination, etc."
10453,in the future.

10465,What bullshit of misinformation.
10466,So does India.
10467,Maharashtra was testing 65k per day before the current wave hit.
10468,"As for Germany, their cases and deaths peaked on Jan 11, and they were testing at 2.09 tests per thousand people that time."
10469,Compared to Maharashtra currently at 2.26.

10475,Would Canadians even take J&amp;J?
10476,I‚Äôve been hearing a lot about people turning down AZ in Canada because of the potential clotting issues and because they perceive it to be an inferior vaccine to Pfizer/Moderna.
10477,"My cynical take on all this is that Biden will come out on his 100th day and say, ""everybody we did it!"
10478,"we masked for 100 days, you can take it off now, I single handedly crushed the virus by just telling everyone to mask up!"""
10479,Just politics all the way around.
10480,never had anything to do with science.
10481,I don't think anyone but the FDA knows for sure.
10482,"Pfizer requested authorization on April 9 and while the FDA doesn't have to go through exactly the same steps to approve it for the younger cohort as they did for all adults, they're still pouring over the data before authorizing."
10483,If I had to *guess* it'll get approval in the next week or so (their initial EUA took 21 days to go from request to authorization) but I'm just a dude on the internet.
10484,"&gt; Fewer car miles means fewer car accident deaths

10485,"There's been fewer accidents in total, but the accidents that have happened have been far more deadly than on average which means out number of vehicle deaths are roughly the same as previous years."
10486,Less people driving but more people driving far more recklessly than normal.

10488,"I don‚Äôt need immunity, I just need to not die or get hospitalized."
10489,That‚Äôs why I got J&amp;J.  I got the shot quickly earlier this month and now I‚Äôm completely free.
10490,Crickets.
10491,"That's good, the more vaccine exported the better, China, EU and India is doing good work..."
10492,"The data might be off for China as well, who knows."
10493,However the number for US is probably more accurate lol
10494,Yeah the CDC does have an agenda: TO CONTROL DISEASE
10495,[deleted]
10496,How can they say the pandemic is over in June?
10497,Are you basing that on some arbritrary date that the UK relaxes restrictions?
10498,"You understand a pandemic means more than one country, right?"
10499,"Also, the contracts have been signed and paid for, those deliveries will be made at the price agreed untill they are fulfilled."
10500,"AZ isn't just gonna go ""lol pandemic over, cough up for the rest lads""."
10501,We decided to go back to more or less normal with our 5 and 9 year olds.
10502,"We still mask up indoors in public places, but we went to the moves for the first time in over a year with the kids this past weekend."
10503,"When the news media isn't scaremongering about variants, it's scaremongering over blood clots!"
10504,It is insane the way they pump out hysteria over these vaccines!
10505,I know.
10506,"Lol

It was an attempt to be humorous that apparently fell flat."
10507,:)
10508,Of course.
10509,Yeah I was waiting for those numbers.
10510,I believe in covid deaths but I thought maybe it would have huge overlap with people who were going to die this year anyway from the flu or something else and the overall increase in deaths would actually be way less than reported covid deaths.
10511,"However, the increase in overall deaths though was more than the covid reported deaths which was very surprising to me."
10512,"Covid didn't just kill a lot of people, it mostly killed a lot of people who otherwise wouldn't have died and even led to an increase in non-covid related deaths (likely from hospitals being at capacity and people with other problems not being able to get care)."
10513,If it's good enough for your homeless it's good enough for all of you.
10514,"Why do you think you deserve ""better""?"
10515,Any vaccine is better than no vaccine.
10516,Yes and it‚Äôs says the vaccines are 90% effective.
10517,Meaning about 10% will still get sick.
10518,If you are sick you can transmit.
10519,There are more countries in the world than just the EU ones and US/UK.
10520,The world needs vaccines badly.
10521,If we can't use them others most certainly can.
10522,The UK received significantly more doses per capita.
10523,Even if the EU were using every dose they've received up to this point as a first dose it'd still be significantly behind because AZ simply didn't deliver.
10524,"I think India should be the world's priority right now, we can not risk the mutations that would go on in a virus soaked India."
10525,"The vaccines still hold up against the variations known so far, but devil knows what would happen in a pool of millions of infected."
10526,"In the interest of the Indian people and the people all over the world that hope that the Covid nightmare will finally end, India must be helped with everything the countries can give."
10527,The USA sitting on their vaccines they don't even want to use is garbage.
10528,Did you know that professional guidance is different all over the world?
10529,I mean that's how old she was when she died so she kind of did.

There needs to be a carrot for these people."

10575,Eh I‚Äôd rather people avoid one vaccine than all of them because they think the government is hiding something.
10576,Yeah I‚Äôm in the northeast in a very high demand area and even my county is starting to see a lot of unfilled appointments.

10617,I think it's at least partially shame.
10618,A lot of these people have come to realize they were wrong and directly contributed to hundreds of thousands of people dying (including their friends/family in many cases) with their carelessness and selfishness.
10619,"But they are too ashamed to outright admit that, so to keep their realities from crumbling, they hold on to *any* reasonable doubts that they can convince themselves of (like writing off any Covid deaths for those who had any existing health issues whatsoever, as if that means that those people would have died anyway)."
10620,"It's pathetic, but for some I think it's a coping mechanism to prevent themselves from having to face the extreme guilt they'd otherwise feel as the death count continues to balloon (selfishness befits more selfishness - go figure)."
10621,The vaccine was not a causal factor.
10622,Complications from COVID occur when COVID depletes someone‚Äôs immune response or introduces new illnesses.
10623,The vaccines isn‚Äôt contributing or exacerbating.

10638,"So again, where's your proof that anyone who's vaccinated has given it to someone else?"
10639,&gt;You'd be pretty safe.

10677,Yh this seems really peculiar tbh considering they're going down in order of age.
10678,The only thing that i can thinks of may possibly be due to restricting  AZ to those over 30 and the under 30s offered an alternative.

10871,"I think what they were trying to get at is the fact that the more people who go unvaccinated, the more the virus has the chance to mutate and become vaccine resistant and start spreading again, and/or possibly become more deadly."
10872,I think with covid the goal is to get to a certain population amount and then things will start to go back to normal - isn't that already the case in the US?
10873,"Covid deniers will use any kind of justifications and mental gymnastics -no matter how insane, to keep being vile individuals."
10874,"You need to wait 2 - 3 month so the immunity against the viral vector decreases, otherwise your inmune system will destroy the second dose before it has a chance of working."

10992,So science is basically your bible now.
10993,Same garbage I heard when I was part of organized religion.
10994,‚ÄúDon‚Äôt question it.
10995,Just have faith.
10996,"The pastor knows how to interpret the bible.‚Äù

Look, science is great."
10997,But a lot of you sound like cultists in regards to it.
10998,The most simple answer is people are different and immune systems (and thus immune system responses) are different.
10999,It happens with every single vaccine ever (that I'm aware of).
11000,A lot of them are from the Emergent facility with cross contamination issues.
11001,It's not clear what's going to happen to all of those doses.
11002,"Yep, its almost like there are more than one expert."
11003,Im finge with that.
11004,"It doesn't make me decide not to listen to any of them and do the math on my own, though."
11005,Poor reading comprehension kinda sums this up
11006,People seem somewhat inherently bad at quantifying risk and have deeply irrational fears.
11007,"I've come to wonder if it's not an evolved response to help us cope with inherent risks, such as disease, that were essentially unavoidable for 99% of human experience while raising our awareness of risks which were less common, but more visible and more easily avoided."
11008,If you see your caveman neighbor killed by wild animals it rightly encourages you to be more cautious of animals.
11009,"Our current information climate totally screws this up, because the news somewhat inherently focuses on events which are rare."
11010,"A shark attack, for instance, is *incredibly* rare, but when it happens its often international news."
11011,"The death of someone in a car accident, conversely, is comparatively common and often doesn't even make the local papers."
11012,"Merck has a market cap of roughly 200bn and Astrazaneca has one of of 140bn, don't think AZ is relatively small."
11013,AZ downside is it has little to no experience in vaccine production.
11014,Ultimately for the UK it was the right decision not to proceed with Merck as with no commitment to UK production it would have a harder time obtaining vaccines.
11015,To me the real shame would be that GSK had already partnered with Sanofi as they could well have been a better fit for the home secretaries wish to partner with a British company and the world's need for competent vaccine production.
11016,"
&gt;People who don‚Äôt have paid sick leave, for instance, may worry about getting a vaccine with side effects that could cause them to miss work."
11017,People who don‚Äôt have a regular medical provider may be uncertain where they can go to get good information.
11018,People who have been discriminated against in the medical system may not trust that health professionals have their best interests at heart.
11019,I think this is something we need to recognize more.
11020,"Anti-vaxxers are not the main issue here, outreach to marginalized and low income groups will be super important."
11021,"For example, something like 1/6 adult Americans are functionally illiterate in their daily lives."
11022,And somewhere around 2/5 have literacy issues.
11023,"Could you imagine how difficult it would be to navigate vaccine booking systems, learn about vaccines and feel comfortable getting one ?"
11024,"There's an overwhelming urge on Reddit to blame, shame, criticize and make fun of people who are nervous or uncomfortable with vaccination."
11025,"I think this is counterproductive, and often very mean-spirited and unhelpful."
11026,Blame and shame is only going to make people dig in their heels.
11027,If we want communities to feel comfortable with the vaccine we need to approach the situation with compassion and understanding.
11028,"You won't convince anyone who feels uncomfortable with vaccination by acting superior, you have to empathize and approach people as equals."
11029,Paywall
11030,"I believe it, for every right leaning person I know who‚Äôs opting to not get vaccinated, there are two left leaning people who won‚Äôt get it."
11031,They‚Äôre the type who would rather take homeopathic remedies and believe in crystals and burning sage
11032,Not really.
11033,"Again, like with your other posts you keep spamming me with, this doesn't say what you were claiming to say."
11034,And you've even responded to a different comment of mine with it.
11035,Are you just going to follow me around every thread and spam me with unrelated articles that you obviously haven't read?
11036,"My kids are a bit older, but they can do whatever they like outdoors."
11037,"Both hang out with friends, do sports, etc."
11038,"Indoors, I'm strict about masking with anyone outside their social bubble."
11039,"In crowded spaces where they will have longer exposure (school, transit), they need to wear KN95 masks."
11040,If you‚Äôre actually as delusional as your pretend to be open the FDA website and check it out yourself :)
11041,"On previous comments, I‚Äôd openly wondered how much runway left in the U.S. adult vaccination campaign."
11042,[According to WaPo-A.B.C.
11043,"polling](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/poll-johnson-johnson-vaccine/2021/04/26/a1085b26-a3ad-11eb-a774-7b47ceb36ee8_story.html?outputType=amp), about three in four (~74%) of respondents had already gotten, or were at least somewhat willing to get, a coronavirus vaccine; that equates to ~60% of the total U.S. population."
11044,"All in all, this leaves us in decent shape."
11045,"If it takes more to get to herd immunity, then we‚Äôd either need to persuade a few others or open it up to people under the age of 16."
11046,"Other interesting tidbits in this poll:
* Only ~22% of unvaccinated American adults would be willing to take Johnson &amp; Johnson‚Äôs vaccine."
11047,"* Only ~46% perceive the J.&amp;J. vaccine as safe, compared to ~73% for Pfizer and ~71% for Moderna."
11048,"They conducted this poll between Sunday and Wednesday of last week, before C.D.C."
11049,and F.D.A.
11050,lifted their recommended pause on the J.&amp;J. vaccine.
11051,Please enlighten us as to how the vaccines were rushed.
11052,We‚Äôll wait.

11054,Wished he snapped on Jim jordan like this
11055,"At the airport they're making everyone social distance while standing in line to board, but then everyone is crammed together once on the plane."
11056,Someone make this make sense to me.
11057,it's obvious you are thick skulled.
11058,"a ""cold"" and ""covid"" are two different viruses."
11059,Difference being that the team did that and not the state.
11060,Mandates vs. Business Decisions/Personal Responsibility
11061,"Yeah, I agree that it could take a while."
11062,The least we can do is wait for US cases to be under control everywhere.
11063,"However, if you agree with the argument then how long it will take doesn‚Äôt matter."
11064,If your goal is to stop this from spiraling out of control and to keep Americans safe then abandoning logic just cause it‚Äôs annoying to have to wear a mask in indoor public places is pretty short sighted.
11065,"Not to mention, we could have to do all this again if a variant pops up that we can‚Äôt vaccinate against."
11066,Wearing a mask now might stop us from having to wear a mask forever.
11067,"Everytime I see someone say this I ask them:

We most definitely saw a spike in deaths in 2020, about 500k of them, over our expected baseline."
11068,If it was not Covid then what do you think was the underlying factor that caused this spike.
11069,"If they respond with ""lockdowns"" I'll ask them why the spike started, globally, before anyone started even talking about lockdowns."
11070,"This is completely besides the point, and has nothing to do with my post."
11071,"Approved for emergency use and fully approved can be both considered ""approved"" for the purposes of my post, which was to point out that there are 3 vaccines, not 1."
11072,"So even if there were something wrong with one of them, 220m people wouldn't be affected."
11073,Nothing I said is remotely untrue.
11074,I'm calling bullshit on that.

11079,The US (and the world) owes him a huge debt of gratitude.
11080,You deserve that Baconator.

11089,why is it acceptable for medical professionals to refuse adults sterilization?
11090,some shit in this world is just backwards
11091,both are non-sense
11092,The only thing i‚Äôm opposing is the coercion not vaccines.
11093,"But, where do you draw the line?"
11094,The government is literally taking away any and all of our rights and freedoms including our livelihood if we refuse to receive this injection.
11095,What would it take for you to put your foot down and oppose the government‚Äôs infringements?
11096,We should stop pretending like 99% of the population doesn‚Äôt have an innate will to live and desire to protect themselves from any harm and that they will follow protocols that statistically are as effective as the vaccine.
11097,Since when have masks + social distancing not been enough to protect you from covid.
11098,"Get a grip lil boi, open up a history book, go back 50-100 years and tell me what governments were able to do to the world with a fraction of the control the U.S. government currently holds."
11099,You're misrepresenting what I said.

11101,[deleted]
11102,I 100% understand the difference.
11103,On average it‚Äôs the same.
11104,Try a mind experiment and you will see
11105,"Yes, the J&amp;J pause increased skepticism, but I think this signals the need to shift away from FEMA and other state-run megasites and more toward a localized vaccination effort."
11106,"These megasites were great, but the population that has not yet been vaccinated likely overlaps pretty heavily with those who cannot or will not go out of their way to travel a long distance for a shot."
11107,[deleted]
11108,Whether or not to wear masks has more to do with the amount of circulating virus than vaccination status.
11109,"More vaccinations will lead to less virus, but not immediately."
11110,"At least some vaccinated people will likely still be able to transmit the disease, although probably for a shorter period of time, so they still need to wear masks while the virus is highly prevalent."
11111,"When cases drop significantly, that‚Äôs the time to reconsider masks."
11112,"Right, I understand."
11113,But it CAN.
11114,Most states that are red have already gone back to normal.
11115,Now the rest of the states have to decide if it‚Äôs worth following suit if it means more people get vaccinated.

11275,"The UK‚Äôs vaccine production is piss poor, we know that that‚Äôs why no vaccine manufacturer has any current manufacturing sources in the UK other than AZ for UK only production."
11276,Pray tell me as you are trying to paint the UK as some evil entity who is not exporting to the rest of the world what sort of impact a measly 1.5m extra doses a week could even do?
11277,We exported the IP effective free of charge because that is what we are good at.
11278,"At the end of the day Europeans and British people have somehow conflated this whole vaccine debacle as some nationalistic battle where somehow AZ represents the UK, it‚Äôs really not the case - AZ fucked up, we are just lucky in the UK to have signed a stronger contract for our measly supply which would have a minimal impact for Europe"
11279,They already are
11280,&gt;It was reasonable to assume a higher level of production.
11281,You say that based on what?
11282,"After 1-2 months, production should be at 100%."
11283,We're six months in and they still don't produce nearly enough.
11284,When do you think Israel will open the borders?
11285,(To relatives of citizens and then to tourists)
11286,"interesting, because as a person that respects womens right to do what they choose with their reproductive system, I also support someones right to do what they choose with regard to vaccination."
11287,You're either consistent on the issue or you're not.
11288,If you're accusing these other people of being inconsistent...what does that say about you??
11289,?
11290,They are certainly the bedrock upon which the Danish vaccination program rests.
11291,J&amp;J we ordered the most from - total bust thus far.
11292,AZ - Need I say more?
11293,"Moderna works fine, but deliveries are minimal."
11294,Don't know if we should expect Curevac to produce anything in time.
11295,[removed]
11296,You are right too.
11297,You are both right.
11298,I think that not selling the production twice (supply UK and EU from the same factories at the same time) would remove that problem.
11299,And then be transparent with the problems/outlook also helps.
11300,No other suppliers change their deliveries significantly hours before shipment - time and time again.

11368,And where's your source on that?
11369,"&gt;In both cases they are hesitating on signing a deal that they would potentially have signed previous to this AZ mess 

Nice bit of counterfactuality here."
11370,&gt;You also by the very nature of these being secret are sharing ‚Äòopinions‚Äô that are formed from ‚Äòpersonal biases‚Äô so don‚Äôt give me that crap.
11371,Hilariously you originally used this point as ‚Äòevidence‚Äô for your opinion so you just invalidated yourself.
11372,I'm forming my opinions based on what the parties involved in the deal have said.
11373,"You, on the other hand, are forming your opinions based on absolutely nothing other than...other opinions of yours."
11374,"So yeah, you only have managed to provide personal speculations and biases so far."
11375,[removed]
11376,If only they knew what they're doing...
11377,They go beyond just Sunday movements in the article.
11378,‚ÄúGovernment officials use current hospitalizations to decide the next action in dealing with the pandemic.
11379,"On the state level, this has been steadily falling over the last month.‚Äù"
11380,Voting is a popularity contest.
11381,It isn't often the smart people are the most popular.
11382,From now on you can just write ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how death certificates are filled out‚Äù so we don‚Äôt have to read your nonsense.
11383,I have a friend who died of covid back in March of last year.
11384,"I have other friends who *still* insist that she didn't die of covid but that she died ""with covid"" and that her death is just an example of the lies people tell to inflate the numbers."
11385,That's the subtext to your original comment though.
11386,"The EU clearly *don't* have a case, but they will have their day in court to act like idiots."
11387,they don't care about keeping us divided.
11388,they cannot assimilate to the current society and are desperately trying to remain relevant.
11389,"they're afraid they're going to disappear with the dinosaurs, which they will."
11390,but in the mean time they will put up a big stink for the remainder of their lives.
11391,these types of people will always be part of the society.
11392,Imagine if the US had approved the AZ vaccine - then we would have had less than 15M delivered of the 120M indicated by AZ.
11393,AZ being sued has nothing to do with political football.
11394,Just deliver what you promise it's pretty simple lol.
11395,It would also be interesting to see if outdoor infections carry a smaller viral load and account for less severe illness.
11396,"Honestly, this is why we need mandatory vaccination squads."
11397,"While I wear my mask whenever I'm out + close to people because I have no problem doing so to make others feel comfortable, I'm not interested in being told I must wear it for the purpose of signalling something to morons."
11398,Often the same people who will freak out about a terrorist event from 20 years ago or sporadic gang crimes primarily found on TV.
11399,"They are acting either (1) not in good faith, or (2) deeply irrational."
11400,"There's no doubt that people who would die in 2020 regardless of Covid, caught Covid and died."
11401,But a hell of a lot of people caught Covid and died as a result of it
11402,[removed]
11403,This is a great response and why I commented
11404,You can't keep an appointment if you don't know where you're going to be.
11405,And no it's not available if you are spending most of your time in a remote location with no transportation of your own.
11406,You can‚Äôt call it a setback when you sell a product that you don‚Äôt have capacity to make.
11407,"Yes there has been setbacks, but even if the EU plants were hitting max capacity they would still fall short."
11408,Why would I know?
11409,I'm not claiming they will automatically win.
11410,"Yea, these are the same people who were running around saying covid is no big deal because of the 98% survival rate and now they are freaking out about the J&amp;J vaccine even though the chances of dying from covid are higher than the chances of getting blood clots from the J&amp;J vaccine."
11411,[removed]
11412,With Captain America?
11413,The problem will be fixed when it‚Äôs FDA approved and schools tell all students they need to get the vaccine
11414,I mean... Not really careless at all.
11415,"There's hardly any instances of anaphylaxis, and the waiting rooms are right outside the clinics and being monitored..."
11416,If someone has an allergic reaction I assure you an epipen and emt team is nearby.
11417,"Yeah conspiracy people in my life believe the number is way over-blown by hospitals looking to obtain funding, and have a bunch of hearsay anecdotes of people dying of other things (usually things now known to be brought on my covid btw like pneumonia) and becoming a covid death statistic."
11418,"They ignore that people who were dying outside of the hospital or even on their way to the hospital were not getting coded as covid, according to doctors and nurses."
11419,"Ironically, most of them thinks they got covid at some point but never confirmed with a test, and they don't make the connection that a lot of people could be doing that, making confirmed covid infections much lower than actual."
11420,"Lastly, death is not the only bad thing that comes with this."
11421,"People I personally know who have recovered from covid have persistent symptoms, now months later, including loss of/reduced sense of smell/taste, and brain fog."
11422,I'm seeing less and less masks out as people get their first dose of vax or pretend they are vaxxed so people will hang out with them.
11423,"Let's not f this up in the final stretch, guys."
11424,Yeah but plenty of high up football coaches are morons when it comes to X‚Äôs and O‚Äôs.
11425,I think many are just extremely charismatic and good at leading and motivating men.
11426,Much like politicians.
11427,I‚Äôm in Westchester right outside NYC.
11428,There is a drastic difference in mask wearing here and in the city.
11429,"The majority of people where I live aren‚Äôt wearing them outdoors but as soon as you get in the city, it‚Äôs like masks are everywhere."
11430,I get you now!
11431,"But honestly, he was the Auburn coach."
11432,We can‚Äôt really expect much from that team to begin with ;)
11433,Except....We‚Äôve learned a ton about the virus in the past year.
11434,"It spreads indoors in tight, unventilated spaces where you‚Äôre near other unmasked people for at least 10-15 minutes."
11435,"That‚Äôs why indoor dining, bars, family holiday gatherings and nightclubs are the main culprits, not outdoor sporting events with large crowds or packed beaches."
11436,There really isn‚Äôt much more to learn.
11437,more dead here the WW2 but that doesnt matter to some fucking idiots.
11438,We keep track but each hospital keeps track independently and they‚Äôre not allowed to share info with each other without the patient signing something.
11439,They‚Äôre definitely not allowed to share our medical info with a grocery store lol.
11440,"When they share info with the CDC they‚Äôre only sharing numbers/stats, not personal info."
11441,"1 million a week would have been a lot better than nothing, which was a potential scenario back then if domestic production hadn't been secured, Pfizer/Moderna hadn't worked out and the US or EU were the only ones producing but had decided to block export of the Oxford vaccine."
11442,You gotta remember that none of the vaccines were guaranteed to be effective and hindsight is 20 20.
11443,"As it happens, guaranteeing at least some domestic production still turned out to be a good call for the UK."
11444,Ideally the IP would have been shared more widely to allow wider production though...
11445,"As a customer, I too wouldn't wanna sign a deal with a supplier that has doubts over whether he'll actually be able to deliver most of its products."

11449,I live in Toronto but I love Newfoundland.
11450,The people are a treasure.
11451,So friendly!
11452,The at-cost part is only when the pandemic is on going.
11453,Which they can declare over in June at which point they can sell for profit.
11454,So technically by delaying their vaccine orders and delivering later could net them more money potentially.
11455,In both cases they are hesitating on signing a deal that they would potentially have signed previous to this AZ mess so yes it is the point.
11456,You have literally just agreed that they are hesitating to sign.
11457,You also by the very nature of these being secret are sharing ‚Äòopinions‚Äô that are formed from ‚Äòpersonal biases‚Äô so don‚Äôt give me that crap.
11458,Hilariously you originally used this point as ‚Äòevidence‚Äô for your opinion so you just invalidated yourself.
11459,"Ok, but what does being several states away actually matter?"
11460,The vaccine is available everywhere.
11461,I got vaccinated on my drive home from work.
11462,It simply isn't a big deal.
11463,Not this millennial.
11464,I was sooooooo excited to get my second Pfizer shot last week.
11465,I guess we should just bend over and take it
11466,"True, but you wouldn‚Äôt say ‚Äúeven among lawyers, this guy was considered dumb‚Äù because that doesn‚Äôt really make sense."
11467,That‚Äôs basically what I was getting at
11468,[removed]
11469,I'm planning a wedding and I've noticed this a lot.
11470,My wedding was originally scheduled for last Aug. We cancelled it in April and waited on some sort of forecast before rescheduling.
11471,We rescheduled for Aug of this year.
11472,"Meanwhile, so many people I know had weddings scheduled for last summer and either rescheduled for Fall/Winter of 2020, or early Spring of this year."
11473,"They all seem shocked that they're getting low turnout, having to reschedule, etc."
11474,"In some ways, I appreciate the blind optimism of ""things suck right now but I'm sure they'll be fine in 3 months"" of last July, but I gotta wonder how many people never really **fully** grasped the extent of this pandemic."
11475,&gt; I refuse to believe any current sitting senator is as dumb as RJ pretends to be.
11476,"Well, you know how fucking dumb Trump was, why is it so hard to believe other dummies can get elected?"
11477,This is what Republicans look like now.

11479,"Thank you so, so much!"
11480,I‚Äôve been fretting about this!
11481,"Don't count out how dumb Wisconsintes are, we elected Scott Walker THREE TIMES."
11482,"&gt; One you have your vaccine, you‚Äôre as safe as you ever will be."
11483,"The sentiment is good, but there‚Äôs more to it than this."
11484,"Because of the compounding factor of community vaccination versus personal vaccination, how safe you are is still affected by the vaccination of others."
11485,"For example because of Israel‚Äôs high vaccination levels, a person who is unvaccinated now in Israel is safer than someone who was among the first to be vaccinated in Israel at the beginning of their campaign."
11486,"There are more unvaccinated people than vaccinated in the world, or are the unvaccinated not people anymore?"
11487,"Here‚Äôs an article about new onset diabetes after covid

11497,Where?
11498,Who?
11499,"I am conflicted, but I am feeling better now that cases in my area are (finally) decreasing."
11500,"I probably still won't bring them to indoor dining or the movies until cases are lower, but we have been going out more as cases drop."
11501,"We're also keeping most of their ""playdates"" with other kids outside."
11502,Can you take them to outdoor places to play?
11503,The risk outdoors is pretty low.
11504,"Dude, my mom, a retired army nurse who reactivated to help track covid last year...also believes it."
11505,How wild is that?
11506,She caught it too and got quite sick.
11507,Too weak to get out of bed.

11521,probably some combination of the B117 and the India variant
11522,That's quite an important point.
11523,Making a vaccine in this way is a biological process.
11524,If the batch doesn't grow correctly it all can't be used.
11525,"It's one of the reasons to be hopeful though, because the mRNA vaccine process doesn't have the same weakness, and the EU has the infrastructure to keep the mRNA vaccine frozen."

But in stores that are crowded I still wear KN95s (grocery shopping casual shopping on weekends) and even after I‚Äôm fully vaxxed I will prob still wear my KN95 as a mental safety net"

11572,That's a total of 26m a month.
11573,They promised by Q2 270m doses to the EU.
11574,"So running at double the max production, constantly 24/7 in order to have successfully reached this target they would have had to have been producing since September 2020."
11575,"AZ have not reached out to other places to produce, they did not alert the EU (Who is contracted to aid in this process if AZ fails, yet they did not reach out for this help)

What sort of shortfall accounts for this miscalculation?"
11576,&gt;The one that the UK funded?

11635,Here is an excerpt from your CDC link.
11636,Put on your best thinking and reading skills for this one when you try to read it!
11637,"""VAERS received 113 reports of death after COVID-19 vaccinations; two thirds of these deaths occurred among LTCF residents."
11638,All-cause mortality is high in LTCF populations because underlying medical conditions are common.
11639,"Based on expected rates of background mortality, among the approximately 1 million LTCF residents vaccinated in the first month of the U.S. COVID-19 vaccination program, approximately 7,000 coincidental, temporally associated deaths from all causes would be expected during the analytic period (7)."
11640,"In contrast, VAERS received 78 reports of death after COVID-19 vaccination in LTCF (long term care facility) residents, and approximately one half were in residents who were in hospice or who had a do-not-resuscitate status."
11641,Reported causes of death in LTCF residents after COVID-19 vaccination are consistent with expected all-cause mortality in this population.
11642,"Among deaths in persons with available death certificate and autopsy information who were not LTCF residents, causes of death were consistent with background all-cause mortality and did not indicate any unexpected pattern that might suggest a causal relationship with vaccination (8)."""
11643,"My father in law in the beginning of the pandemic proclaimed how the flu had killed more people and that the ""Muslim n*gger"" Obama had more deaths with h1n1 (12,000 based on cdc numbers)."
11644,"Now that his CDC source for flu and h1n1 deaths are miniscule compared to the CDC's covid death toll, he no longer thinks those numbers are right and that everyone that died in the last year was ""conveniently"" labeled as a covid death, even though other death categories have their usual numbers."

11664,In normal times this would be true.

11897,"This was always the expectation, the UK wasn't pushing for preventing anyone else ""catching up""."
11898,"It isn't British exceptionalism, if you administered half a million doses 12 weeks ago you now have to use half a million doses giving them their second jab."

11913,"I think in the real world, all of the vaccines currently approved in the EU and US will be shown to have similar effectiveness, except the one dose J&amp;J will be lower (or less long-lasting) in the real world."

11920,"I was quite cautious before vaccination, but when my current vaccine incubation period is over, I‚Äôm getting right back out there."
11921,Are you saying that everyone who hasn't gotten vaccinated yet is an anti-vaxxer?
11922,The hope is that it will.
11923,Pfizer applied for full use and there is no reason they should be turned down.
11924,"I don't know where you've been hearing that, but it's certainly not something I've ever heard."

11971,It's like they're so un-self aware that they don't realize articles like this discourage the hesitant to be vaccinated.
11972,"""I understand your frustration"" is one of the most useless phrases ever spoken."
11973,"From a real politik standpoint, Canada and Mexico would most benefit the US and on a secondary front I'd say India given how important India is not only for immigration but for the giant American corporations."
11974,Interestingly.
11975,Moderna had a partially vaccinated effectiveness of 91% while Phizer has one of 78%.
11976,Fully vaccinated had an effectiveness was 99% moderna and 97% phizer.
11977,"Given the fully vaccinated group is only nominally different, the partially vaccinated group looks like there is a difference."

11979,Send them to poor countries then.

11983,This /s needs to be capitalized.
11984,"This is reddit, after all."
11985,Ok actually you have changed my mind that‚Äôs a good point that the vaccine vials expire once opened so you don‚Äôt want to spread out demand too much.
11986,So 24hr sites isn‚Äôt a good idea but I do think more sites should be open in evenings/nights maybe alternating times on different days like someone mentioned.
11987,How is forcing people that cannot get or transmit covid to wear masks anything other than ridiculous?
11988,"It's a power trip that authoritarians just don't want to let go of, nothing more."
11989,My main question on this is most other advanced countries were able to secure vaccine supply contracts up to 2x or 3x their current population because they know problems like this exist.
11990,Especially for a brand new drug.
11991,Why didnt the EU?
11992,According to the cdc and  Fauci that is no longer the case .
11993,I‚Äôm sick of their flip flops on masks .
11994,This plays into anti vax and anti mask sentiments.
11995,We know masking at large outdoor events where social distancing is not possible stops the spread of covid .
11996,We have seen consequences of not masking in India and in areas that held large Trump rallies .
11997,I would say 45%  of the USA will not get vaccinated for whatever reason and this just makes it worse for reopening safely
11998,So edgy.
11999,oh man.... this is so common in India.

12108,We have to continue wearing masks until numbers drop to acceptable levels.
12109,If more people got vaccinated we'd get there faster...
12110,"But, really, masks are  still one of the best anti-covid measures."
12111,The benefits are significant and the burden is quite small.
12112,Compare it to the sacrifices of shutting down schools and businesses and it's a small price to pay for salvation.
12113,This.
12114,"If you have a severe headache lasting more than 4 days that isn't reduced by painkillers, consult your doctor."
12115,But I wouldn't even wait long.
12116,"It's quick and easy to do a blood test to immediately determine if there are issues with your platelets, and no doctor is going to tell you to come back in three days if you have a searing headache that isn't being relieved, and that is a symptom of the blood clotting everyone is talking about."
12117,"This thing doesn't sneak up on people by surprise, the symptoms couldn't be more obvious if they broadcast themselves on a loudspeaker."
12118,And there are effective treatments once they've determined someone has it.
12119,"A case rate of 1:150,000 means nothing if all those people got timely, successful treatment."
12120,"There's then a 1:150,000 chance of getting a nasty headache and needing to take some tablets."
12121,"I'd love to go back to Cedar Point this summer, but I have a feeling the lines will be twice as long as usual with everybody desperate to get out and do stuff."
12122,"Probably gonna wait till September, once school starts again to have a chance to actually *ride* any of the coasters..."
12123,Does anyone have Rapid Tests available for home use yet?
12124,"I have no doubt there are some applications for them in the US, but it's going to be fairly minimum in overall numbers."
12125,"Keep X number of million for such applications, move the rest."
12126,I didn't know about him introducing a threshold and certainly not him changing it by *a million people.
12127,"* I'm really sour on him as a governor lately, I think he's going way too far with the restrictions and not acting like a civil servant at all."
12128,It's disgraceful and it might be enough to get me to vote against him.

12131,"*

Notes:

* The raw data can be downloaded exact totals for every age group can be downloaded from the [CDC vaccination demographic trends page](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccination-demographics-trends) as a CSV."
12132,"The CDC indicates the data is by ""Date Administered"", but it actually appears to be by ""Date Reported""."
12133,"* Texas (about 9% of US population) is excluded from CDC demographic data, so the tables do not match national totals."
12134,* The CDC reports vaccinations for the 0-17 age group.
12135,"The 16-17 age group is calculated using 2019 Census estimates that about 11.4% of those aged 0 to 17 are ages 16 and 17, assuming that all 0-17 age group doses were given to those ages 16 or 17."
12136,Huh?
12137,That would never happen.
12138,"First, afaik, those suits are air conditioned or at least have fans

Second, they spend very short intervals out in the elements."
12139,"Like in a given hour they may spend 15 minutes greeting guests, then a 30 minute break, then another 15 minutes greeting guests."
12140,Disney doesn't ever intentionally break the immersion.
12141,There's underground tunnels at their parks for a reason
12142,I maintain that filling a bunch of blowdarts with J&amp;J and hiring a shadowy ninja clan to vaccinate holdouts would be way more fun.
12143,Glad you're feeling better.
12144,"Honestly didn't know what it was at first tbh, but the more I read it seemed pretty common"
12145,"if a muslim woman can do it all her life, why cant you?"
12146,huh?
12147,/s
12148,"Right now CA still plans to have restrictions on ""[large-scale indoor events](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2021/04/06/governor-newsom-outlines-the-states-next-step-in-the-covid-19-pandemic-recovery-moving-beyond-the-blueprint/)"" after June 15, so it's unclear whether NY or CA will have more restrictions in August."
12149,"Well, the article says ""If the trial is successful, it is just possible a home cure for Covid-19 will become available later this year."""
12150,So my guess would be that this could be a real product in late 2021 or early 2022.
12151,"Unless, of course, if something comes up in the trials."
12152,"Rallies, where people are stationary, closely packed and shouting, ARE a large source of infection."
12153,"In my state of MN, you could track case increases to Trump rallies."
12154,"Protest marches, where most people were both moving and masked, were much smaller sources of infection."
12155,"""raising the prospect of a cure for the common cold as well as future pandemic threats""

This could be even bigger in the long-term than their vaccine"
12156,Why have Canadians been complaining so much about their vaccination rate if they can do 40% of their population in a month?
12157,&gt; Everyone puts so much stock in the initial efficacy numbers but the trials/timings were so different.
12158,I would agree with you if not for the 6 months follow up numbers from both Pfizer and Moderna.
12159,"Both still showing 90%+ efficacy, which obviously includes B117."
12160,"I am not here to say they are 100% better than AZ/JJ, but you'd be hard pressed arguing they aren't top tier."
12161,"Give than we have more than enough in the US, the path of least resistance is stick with what works and move the rest elsewhere."
12162,"The world needs vaccines, nothing is going to go to waste."
12163,"The scary part is knowing that people will definitely die from it, even if the risk itself is low"
12164,I knew vaccines would eventually slow down I just didn‚Äôt expect it to be so soon but a long tail makes sense
12165,You know India only vaccinated around 10% or less of their population.
12166,You can‚Äôt use India when debating vaccine efficacy
12167,Yeah... the headline-- while true--  made the feat sound less impressive than it is.
12168,"I was thinking ‚Äúwell, the U.S. has also administered a vaccine to more than half of adults overall; how are they outpacing?‚Äù

N.P.R."
12169,should‚Äôve gone with ‚Äú7 in every 8‚Äù or ‚Äúalmost 9 in every 10.‚Äù
12170,"&gt;The concern seems to be about potential fertility risks, though not sure where that's coming from."
12171,https://www.statnews.com/2021/03/25/infertility-myth-covid-19-vaccines-pregnancy/ This myth seems to be very widespread among young people in social media.
12172,This is business telling you when they believe restrictions will actually be lifted.
12173,The first planned *outdoor* event in Chicago is scheduled for September.
12174,"That's the timeline for when people actually expect it to be safe (public policy, not health) to host something."
12175,&gt; Using Disney as an example again; with summer fast approaching having people wear masks outdoors can be a heat exhaustion hazard.
12176,Fuck that shit.
12177,"If I go there and Mickey &amp; Donald are walking around with their masks off, I'm demanding a refund."
12178,I don't give a shit about other people's health.
12179,I read this as ‚Äúthe state ***has*** been shut down for like a year now‚Äù and thought you were implying COVID was the flu... and was wondering how you were getting upvotes
12180,both
12181,This makes me want to cry.
12182,My heart goes out to this family.
12183,Because Cuomo is the one in charge of New York's public health restrictions.
12184,He wrote a book about it.
12185,Restrictions are politics.
12186,There's no way around it.
12187,"A previous administration most certainly would, but I think most people don't realize how slow government can be."
12188,"They already ""lent"" a few million to Canada and Mexico so I don't think it was a question of it not happening but lighting a fire under their butts to get it done sooner."
12189,Unless you're Brazillian
12190,Second dose is great and all but first dose is already more than enough to curb the spread.
12191,Actually if you get the vaccine they hand you a free bag if meth /s
12192,Hopefully ages 12-15 can get the vaccine soon.
12193,They prevent serious disease very effectively actually.
12194,Could provide some references but have no time now

12196,Let‚Äôs go West Virginia.
12197,So smart.
12198,Lol I'm not.
12199,I've lived here for a while lol.
12200,It's oddly progressive for such a backwards state
12201,Our species is really bad at judging risk that isn't 'doing this will get you immediately eaten by a lion.'
12202,I'm not sure why you're being downvoted.
12203,This is the truth.
12204,https://twitter.com/DrEricDing/status/1379621738850422787
12205,Not surprised.
12206,They don't ever remember an America that functioned properly.
12207,How much for brushing teeth?
12208,It's safer than the virus itself which I'm still suffering long-covid after having it in March/April last year.
12209,"Outdoors is waaay safer than infdoors in general, but if you are going to be crowded with people, you should still wear a mask outdoors."
12210,"[https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/04/13/covid-outside-safety/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/04/13/covid-outside-safety/)  


&gt;In a¬†[systematic review](https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/223/4/550/6009483?login=true)¬†of published studies on transmission of the novel coronavirus and other respiratory viruses, Razani and colleagues found that \*\*less than 10 percent of cases described were spread outdoors.\*\* But they also found frustratingly few papers that detailed the settings or clearly compared indoor and outdoor situations."
12211,"&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúOur takeaway from this is that it‚Äôs not impossible to get an infection outdoors, even though from what is published, clearly the proportion of when that happens is much lower,‚Äù Razani said."
12212,"She added: ‚ÄúIf you are going to a beach ‚Äî which is a beautiful thing ‚Äî you should avoid times when it‚Äôs crowded, and have your mask, and have a Plan B.‚Äù"
12213,There are a lot of unknowns with this virus.
12214,I've heard some speculate that some in the East may have inherited partial immunity from past Coronaviruses.
12215,"Than again, some places handle it just fine until they don't."
12216,See India.
12217,Inputs for vaccine production were basically being entirely used up by domestic US production.
12218,"That bottleneck is easing right now, so those input materials can be directed elsewhere."
12219,There wasn't really a magical surplus of ingredients floating around.
12220,"Feingold came to speak to one of my college classes once, he was a super thoughtful and sincere dude who did not give me any of that typical kind of disingenuous politician vibe."
12221,I was so disgusted when Johnson was able to win just by dumping a bunch of cash into lies playing on fear and insecurity.
12222,What a sleazy disgrace.
12223,Every time I hear his name now I can't help but grimace.
12224,"I guess I interpretted it as like '99/'00, but yea, in '01/'02 when we were all worried about anthrax mail...."
12225,&gt; why am I getting downvoted?
12226,You know why.
12227,Don't play dumb.
12228,Exactly.
12229,Yanks is the nicest word the rest of the world uses for us.
12230,But even the rest of the US laughs at the south.
12231,You guys are focused on transgenders in sports and bathrooms while the rest of us live our lives.
12232,"In my experience, that's not true."
12233,"It's important to know that if community spread is significant, you still carry a significant risk of catching and spreading COVID even if vaccinated, especially if you're not masking indoors in mixed company."
12234,In that sense why don‚Äôt we just have a law that you have to wear a mask inside your house??
12235,As it‚Äôs ‚Äúvery likely that you will be coming and going frequently‚Äù
12236,Imagine if Fauci if responded like this.
12237,"&gt; I live in a well off European country and we have no chance of vaccinating our population this year

There will be enough doses to fully vaccinate all adults in the EU in Q3."
12238,Only if no AZ and J&amp;J doses are used there is a risk of it taking until Q4 before there is enough doses for everybody.
12239,"Weekly deliveries now are much larger than what was delivered in the entirety of January, for example."
12240,"But yeah, we definitely need to get more doses to well-needing poorer countries, for everybody's best."
12241,I mean don‚Äôt go out and get absolutely shitfaced.
12242,It‚Äôs perfectly acceptable for a teacher to go out and have a few beers with friends.
12243,"Hell, If the parents see you they‚Äôd probably buy you a beer if you‚Äôre a good teacher to their kid haha"
12244,"Most Indians I am seeing who are saying ""This will be remembered forever"" Aren't saying it in a good way"
12245,"Dude get the hell out...

Its AZ thats been shameful at every corner."
12246,Comprehension of nuance isn‚Äôt happening in this political climate.
12247,"So when Biden said ""100 days of masks"" he really meant 100 days of outdoor masking."
12248,He never said it was a vicegrip.
12249,Get some reading comprehension
12250,Apnews is a far more respectable media organization than any godi media outlet.
12251,Massachusetts has an outdoor mask mandate for everyone over the age of 5.
12252,"For children from ages 2 to 5, masks are encouraged but not legally required."
12253,Why does this sub have a mid claiming to be a global health  phd when they are not?
12254,"Oh yeah, 2001 US wasn't on edge or anything."
12255,Totally would've flown under the radar.
12256,"Sadly, this will only end up being worse than necessary."
12257,Many more people will die and end up taking far longer to overcome.
12258,They think doctors and medical professionals the world over are engaging in a conspiracy to label lots of random normal deaths as COVID deaths.
12259,It's pretty bonkers.
12260,"The argument is that 5% is the ""real"" number of COVID deaths, and 95% actually died of something else."
12261,"So, that doesn't work because there is an increase of deaths that is excess what we should expect for this time frame that maps perfectly with the deaths from COVID."
12262,"And, per-conditions make them more likely to die from COVID, not that they all decided to die this year for some reason."
12263,This post appears to be about vaccines.
12264,"We encourage you to read our helpful resources on the COVID-19 vaccines:

12265,Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) if you have any questions or concerns.
12266,*
12267,Shameful behaviour from the EU.
12268,CDC was relying on the WHO's initial recommendation against masks for everyone because there was no evidence of asymptomatic spread yet.
12269,"The moment evidence of that mode of transmission became available, the WHO and CDC immediately change their mask recommendations."
12270,What is so hard to understand about that?
12271,Why are people like yourself being so disingenuous with the narrative?
12272,Not sure if [this](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/03/03/science/vaccine-efficacy-coronavirus.html) answers your question.
12273,Basically you're asking about what's called the efficacy of the vaccine.
12274,"And yes, since efficacy is not 100%, there is some population of vaccinated people who will end up infected."
12275,"Public universities must constitutionally also offer an exemption, making vaccines a light suggestion just like they‚Äôve always been in public universities."
12276,"I don't think it helps when you keep repeating the message ""you can still catch and spread the virus it just makes it so you don't get sick"" when most of these people would have very mild symptoms to begin with."
12277,It's time we start showing how these vaccines slow the spread and push that as a huge benefit
12278,They have a huge number of vaccinated people.
12279,I‚Äôm not sure what you mean.
12280,Maybe I wasn‚Äôt clear.
12281,The UK definitely still has virus circulating and a large number of vaccinated people.
12282,How many have been reinfected?
12283,They don‚Äôt need to resort to unethical studies to get answers.
12284,They can study the community.
12285,"Yeah but I‚Äôm more likely to make bad decisions if I‚Äôm drunk- besides, how will I not be seen by parents, etc?"
12286,Modi is a far right hindu supremacist.
12287,Not surprising.
12288,Thanks.
12289,"However, the first is pre print and i knew the second one, which focused on indoor transmissions."
12290,They won‚Äôt.... what an absurd conservative claim .
12291,There was also a lot of previous studies that suggested untrained people were likely to fuck it up by not wearing them well and touching their faces.
12292,I hope I'm wrong but lets see how this plays out over the next few months.
12293,I thought Michigan did lockdown at least a bit for their latest wave?
12294,Not sure why you‚Äôre getting downvoted.
12295,This is objectively true
12296,we need more and easier constant testing.
12297,"maybe a lateral breath flow covid test device for everyone , so asymptomatic people will know when they are contagious/sick before they leave home"
12298,"In your example, first your friends would have to get infected (very unlikely, as the vaccine reduces their risk by a factor of ~20)."
12299,Then they would have to infect you (very unlikely as the vaccine reduces your risk by a factor of ~20).
12300,So this staycation would be ~1/400th as risk as it would have been if none of you were vaccinated.
12301,(This number would be exactly correct if it were just you and one friend.
12302,"Having a larger gathering will change the details of the calculation slightly, and I am too lazy to think about that at this point in the morning."
12303,"I don't think it will change the conclusion here, though."

12305,"But,  but people in Asia have all been wearing a mask for decades because they care so much for each other....../s"
12306,See I got mixed fillings about this.
12307,Numbers are rising I don‚Äôt think we should be leasing anything until we get threw this.
12308,But hey what do I know I‚Äôm no expert.
12309,I bought some reusable masks for my husband and I that are specifically anti-fog as we both wear glasses.
12310,The regular blue disposables were starting to drive me insane with the fogging.
12311,Don't forget every single pharma company will leave the EU because AZ signed a contract they couldn't keep
12312,Those things are not mutually exclusive.
12313,[deleted]
12314,Why would you normalize a measure (outdoor mask wearing) that isn‚Äôt helping?
12315,All that‚Äôs gonna do is make people less likely to take other measures seriously
12316,The data from the large studies suggest the vaccine is 100% effective at reducing very serious illness.
12317,"Basically the equivalent of taking a serious illness and making it a very light cold, at worst, and also very good at preventing any infection at all."
12318,"However, as it may still be possible to catch/spread to someone who hasn't been vaccinated, he's trying to encourage people to distance until everyone has the ability to be vaccinated."
12319,Is that what he said?
12320,"And even so, what is the flip flop here?"
12321,"Get the vaccine, but also continue to utilize other virus mitigating techniques?"
12322,That just sounds like he's doubling down on protecting yourself
12323,Good.
12324,then people only need to fear getting the cold from you.
12325,Its an improvement I guess.
12326,"I don't think the issue here is a lack of education, it's a lack of empathy."
12327,Young people know they are at low risk and they just don't seem to care about what happens to anyone else.
12328,I saw a poll recently where 51% of people under 18-30 weren't planning on getting vaccinated.
12329,That's an appallingly low number considering over 80% of 65+ are already vaccinated and in the UK they are hitting 95% in that age group.
12330,Everyone I know that's a millennial has taken the vaccine as soon as they can and we are all in out late 20s-early 30s...
12331,Here we go... What's the excuse now?
12332,"Newport, RI doesn‚Äôt even really qualify as a city"
12333,Pre-symptomatic
12334,Not true.
12335,I live in ny and you‚Äôll see people without masks outside.
12336,It‚Äôs not required unless you‚Äôre using public transport or at a restaurant/bar and even then it‚Äôs only required when you‚Äôre walking to and from your table
12337,Nope.
12338,You just see lower spread than indoors and are satisfied with it.
12339,Even this study concluded the spread outdoors isn't zero.
12340,They also clearly mentioned the confounding factors which can affect this study which you clearly are choosing to ignore.
12341,I cited this study because I read it and it is a meta study.
12342,Even then it hasn't claimed anywhere to zero.
12343,Outdoor masking is totally valid until vaccinations have reached a threshold.
12344,The only nonsensical statement is you risking unvaccinated people not wearing mask outdoors.
12345,"The toll may not be as high but it will still lead to new cases, new clusters and loss of life."
12346,People who can't follow wearing a mask really baffle me even further.
12347,Your risk is low but if you catch it can be deadly.
12348,Even then you choose to gamble?
12349,What kind of crazy person are you?
12350,"Now if they are all fully vaccinated, hell kiss a stranger indoors in a crowded place."
12351,You may catch something else but it won't be covid.

12354,"Very few vaccines have This high of efficacy, not sure what you‚Äôre talking about"
12355,I was thinking of that too!
12356,The dude literally thought islands floated on the ocean.
12357,I had never heard of such stupid.
12358,I'm pretty sure viral load can have an impact on severity of infection I'm not sure that analogy holds up great here.
12359,"I think it's more that not everyone will have a perfect reaction to the vaccine and some people can't/won't get it, so it's important for everyone eligible to get the vaccine for herd immunity"
12360,Nobody actually believes this
12361,"Absolutely, your immune response is essentially a race against the virus propagating in your body."
12362,"If the initial load is extremely high, the immune response is just not going to be able to overcome it."
12363,"And the inverse is true, the more people that are vaccinated, the weaker the viral loads that still manage to spread through the community, so much so that even those who are not vaccinated, if they are exposed to the virus, might be exposed to such a small viral load that their immune system is readily able to thwart it without issue."
12364,It‚Äôs totally fake.
12365,"My congressman had a town hall where he said his colleagues are smart people and they believe in climate change, 80% of the climate deniers he works with definitely believe it‚Äôs real but they humor and manipulate their constituents."
12366,He‚Äôs like there‚Äôs a minority who are truly deluded but most of them are just playing a game.
12367,Awful.
12368,Good luck getting biology to catch up with technology.

12374,"I mean, teachers can drink too"
12375,"Yes,  the New York Times live updates are famous for their juvenile journalism."
12376,"Ive just been using common sense while outside, if I'm no where near anyone I don't wear a mask but if I go into the town centre and there are crowds of people I'll pop one on."
12377,They also went inside lmao
12378,And that no other company will ever sign deals with the EU or something along those lines.

12395,You can‚Äôt underestimate the social pressure not to vaccinate.
12396,My brother-in-law got vaccinated as soon as he was eligible.
12397,His identical twin brother lives in a rural area and his family goes to a megachurch.
12398,"You can tell deep down he knows he should get the vaccine and probably wants to, but the pressure from his wife and his church community is so high that nobody in his family has gotten it (all their kids are of eligible age)."
12399,This is definitely already a thing.
12400,If you hear someone died of Covid the question from my conservative relatives is immediately ‚Äúbut was he old/ diabetic/ asthmatic?‚Äù etc until they find a secondary condition.
12401,Apparently it‚Äôs not a problem if someone dies who had another condition and saying Covid killed them is just inflating numbers.
12402,Good

12404,*Obligatory joke alert
12405,As a resident of Alabama who is vaccinated all I can say is that I guess we are pulling ourselves up by the bootstraps and getting our antibodies the old fashioned way.
12406,"Fuck it, I dont care, you dumb assess want to get sick from a disease you don't need to, knock yourselves out."
12407,Wait...someone's questioning the vaccines?
12408,What are you trying to communicate here
12409,"God , I can understand that anger."
12410,The situation in India is horrific and he's so justified in feeling furious at those who are doing everything to make it worse.
12411,China has a China-first policy.
12412,Everything they do is to benefit their own country.
12413,"Now that the West has decided to send aid to India, the benefits of China doing it as well have been blunted."
12414,"Well that's why not just America, but all first world countries need to start donating vaccines to India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and all those surrounding countries."
12415,I hear you (and I'm vaccinated in that demographic and will vaccinate my kids for the same reason).
12416,I just think it's hard for people to care as much about a vaccine that doesn't personally benefit them very much.
12417,It feels a little like the HPV vaccine for teen boys.
12418,Teen boys should get the HPV vaccine for public health reasons but they personally don't benefit very much from it.
12419,"I, too, would like to know this."
12420,"On a related note though, if the Virus is allowed to run its course through society it will continue to breed variants which could eventually render the vaccines useless."
12421,"So in that way, it is still dangerous for too much of the population to remain unvaccinated."
12422,Everyone knows the vaccines aren‚Äôt 100% effective
12423,Absolutely abysmal roll out in SA.
12424,I hope the hesitancy will be overcome by safe outcomes with the vaccine.

12427,"Are we supposed to be surprised that millenials have read, a half dozen times, about a variant which escapes the vaccine and they think ""well the vaccine doesn't work."""
12428,The irony is fauci was completely right a few weeks ago when he said that mass vaccinations will remove restrictions from covid.
12429,It's really the only meaningful and lasting way to do it without a whole bunch of sick people.
12430,it's probably both.

12437,"but some people are actually just that stupid, too."
12438,"My understanding was that part of the reception was also inside, and most if not all of the people publicly ID‚Äôd as positive were photographed inside without masks."

12461,Good.

12468,[removed]
12469,Why?
12470,You are vaccinated
12471,Herd immunity is all about viral load.
12472,"The weaker the viral load in the community, the less likely it can get a foothold anywhere."
12473,Which is why 100% vaccination is not needed for herd immunity.
12474,Immunity is hand-to-hand combat.
12475,Immune cells go out and inspect other cells.
12476,"When they find virus, they call killer cells to destroy infected cells."
12477,Load matters in this battle.
12478,"If the virus can disseminate through the body before the immune system gets to it, the fight is much harder and infection can get established in spite of the immune system."
12479,"Fortunately the immune system fights on and hopefully  wins in the end, but sometimes not."
12480,I am immunosuppressed.
12481,"When I got the second vaccination, the spike proteins got the high ground."
12482,"While they are harmless, my immune system has been out killing them now for 12 days."

12492,New Hampshire is a bit weird.
12493,There's definitely something off in the data.
12494,They went from having effectively 0 available doses last week to having a substantial stockpile.
12495,They went from a 7-day moving average of 27K to 4K in less than 10 days.
12496,"My guess is that there is a little bit of data not being fully reported (based on second doses due alone, I think they should be *significantly* above a 4K daily administration rate for the past week) - but I also think New Hampshire has inflected hard."
12497,"With their centralized appointment system and good distribution in March/early April, they hit everyone who wanted to be vaccinated."
12498,They're at about 75% of adults with a first dose.
12499,Those last 25% are going to be hard to come by.
12500,"That said, as mentioned above, with a 59 to 29 first:second dose number, they should be swimming in second dose administration."
12501,I'd love to see the underlying data reported by the state because something has seemed off with their data for a while.
12502,"Either they are way underreporting for the past week, or I almost wonder if there is some sort of issue with second doses being reported as first doses."
12503,Their first dose trajectory over April up until last week had been *insane*.
12504,"I'm 32, and this is exactly why I'm getting the vaccine (got my first shot on Friday)."
12505,I just desperately want things to go back to normal.
12506,"I want friends, and I want to go to some concerts dammit."
12507,So glad my country has left the EU.
12508,Voted remain but the way the EU has treated this debacle has pushed me over the edge.
12509,AZ isn't blameless but imagine suing a company for not meeting deadlines in the extraordinary circumstances we're in.
12510,The virus hit a year ago and these companies are trying to ramp up production in record time.
12511,Of course some will fall short.
12512,"Of course, not fully defending AZ."
12513,They seem to have over promised.
12514,But from the EU side this reeks of political mudslinging over their lethargic vaccine procurement.
12515,"I'm fully vaccinated as of last week now, and no I'm definitely not more relaxed."
12516,I still am just as paranoid about getting it and just as cautious as I have been over the last year.
12517,"I still wear my mask everywhere, still social distancing, and still not going out into public except for work and to get groceries."
12518,"Still no reason to risk it, in my opinion."
12519,"So as a fully vaccinated individual, if I am exposed to a group of people shedding the virus opposed to one person, the vaccine will be less effective?"
12520,Source?
12521,"A meta analysis shows outdoor transmission is  less than 10%, so not sure where you are getting ""really low"" or ""rare"" from."

12531,Yeah but I think the average American is dumb so it‚Äôs more than half
12532,Does anyone know why this is being suggested?
12533,Up until now we've been opening in 5-year groups at a time and the capacity for first doses is currently quite low (~100k per day) due to second dose requirements.
12534,Considering it was Oxfords strict requirement to keep it at cost I don't see them changing stance because the company the UK government chose for them is horrendous.
12535,"Bet if Merck got the deal which they were initially meant to we wouldn't be seeing testing issues, and production issues but here we are."
12536,useful in what way?
12537,everyone will be vaccinated by the time any results are published.
12538,One of the plants I visited gave me anti-fog safety glasses and they really do work.
12539,If masks are required then anti-fog glasses should be required because your glasses fogging up are a definite safety hazard.
12540,How do we handle it ?
12541,Shut our ears and only open them when Fauci speaks ?
12542,Even then we would be screwed

12560,"...and yet that's all you're going to get, because a controlled study about outdoor spread is nearly impossible and most likely medically unethical."
12561,"This analysis admits that more research needs to be done, but due to the past research on influenza spreads and virus behavior that this is about what they expect to see."
12562,"Sadly we can't just shove 1000 unvaccinated people in a room and pump COVID into the air, and then repeat the experiment outside."
12563,Pesky IRB.
12564,"That‚Äôs the point though, they are acting hesitantly in signing."
12565,Not that it matters for the EU because of Pfizer but still if Pfizer hadn‚Äôt pulled through then this would be a bit of a mess.

12601,What will that tell us about the variants reinfection people?
12602,It‚Äôs just unnecessary and I doubt it will yield worthwhile results.
12603,I mean Fauci literally did just that but you don't care since it doesn't fit your narrative

More than two dozen attendees tested positive after the Rose Garden event."
12609,"So, either half of the 45 attendees of the indoor reception got it when indoors, or the people packed together outside hugging and talking at length with one another also got it outdoors."
12610,"No, it‚Äôs not the same as walking through the park with others dozens of feet away."
12611,But it is like going to an outdoor concert packed together.
12612,Yeah those are literature reviews last year which are limited by the fact that they didn't have much information back in August 2020.
12613,There weren't even variants back then.

&gt;Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Toronto, said he supports the anticipated guidance from the CDC."
12770,He added that more research is showing that very few Covid-19 infections happen in outdoor settings.
12771,"&gt;But masks should still be mandated in indoor settings, he said, **until most of the U.S. population is vaccinated** and it is difficult for the virus to spread from one person to the next."
12772,We're a couple weeks away from most of the country being vaccinated.
12773,I'm wondering if we'll be seeing these experts advocate for an end to the mask mandate when that occurs.
12774,"Considering how strongly the CDC has been suggesting that vaccinated people aren't transmitting the virus, we'll be at a point where there are more Americans who *don't* need to wear a mask than Americans who should be wearing one."
12775,"I personally don't think it's justifiable to have a mask mandate for the entire country when there isn't conclusive evidence that it's necessary for the majority, vaccinated population to wear them."
12776,And now many in every State are going to wait to see if their states initiates such a plan.
12777,Because cash.
12778,This waiting will result in more deaths.
12779,Altered behavior patterns.
12780,We know they are because we know the case numbers would be higher otherwise.

12787,"I would like to see ""at full capacity, if vaccine rates are high and cases are low"""
12788,Probably 6-8 weeks when everyone who wants the vaccine is able to get it and past the 2 week limit
12789,I have no idea.
12790,I mean I believe it is retroactive but he's still in the irs conference
12791,"To be clear, the positivity ratio has also dropped dramatically."
12792,I think talking about each individual death during his press conferences has kept him grounded and very conservative through all of this.
12793,I'm not sure if other governors are still doing this.
12794,It also helps that he has zero qualms admitting he doesn't know something (which is a lot of things) and is willing to defer to experts like Clay Marsh or General Hoyer when it comes to setting and implementing policy.

12801,They will wear masks for the rest of their lives and refuse to be around anyone that does not have a mask on.
12802,They are completely consumed by irrational fear to the point where every moment of their life is spent in fear of the virus.
12803,"This is the fault of the media, but you also have to blame the individual for being unable to separate reality and fearmongering from the media."
12804,They can hurt you if the virus mutates and the vaccines become ineffective once more.

12806,the NBA succesfully bubbled over 1000 people  with spectacular success.
12807,The Olympics can try to recreate that at a bigger scale

12809,"Post another low paid employee at the door of each business to check vaccination cards, and if you don't have one: ""Sorry, gotta wear a mask inside"" (not that the type of person who hasn't gotten vaccinated at this point hasn't been flaunting that rule the entire time)."

12826,Beyond heartbreaking.
12827,You can also count the 4 million vaccines that the U.S. donated.
12828,But you're right.
12829,"The fact that AZ is having such difficulties in the U.S., despite the fact that there are export controls of both the vaccines and raw material, shows how poorly AZ has managed its production."
12830,"They shouldn't be having production issues if the U.S. is hogging the raw materials, and yet they are."

12858,A waiver would also provide legal certainty for governments and investors that are inclined to repurpose existing pharmaceutical manufacturing or build new facilities but are fearful of intellectual property liability.

12915,Really hoping that they take a full measure here.
12916,Something along the lines of saying that masks are unnecessary in all outdoor settings apart from large crowds where it isn't possible to distance.
12917,"Something more conservative like only being able to unmask in small groups, 6 feet apart, etc, will probably backfire and just make the restriction skeptics even more frustrated with the pathway back to normalcy."

12962,She kind of looked alarmed when I told her that she should be more afraid of me since there were 5 positive cases at my partner's employer (out of only 50 people) have come down with Covid in the last few weeks and that the day before I was notified by the school that a child on my kids' bus came up positive.

12972,I think we‚Äôve reached more than 50% of people who are vaccinated throughout the country and there‚Äôll always be around 40% of people who won‚Äôt get the vaccine due to religious or political beliefs.

13013,That shows an interesting yet incorrect understanding of the law
13014,It would be nice if they promised no restrictions.
13015,Instead they are still telling them they will still have to social distance and wear masks.
13016,And larger classes will still be online/virtual.
13017,I have to wonder if its primarily because of the money generated from those indoor venues particularly in the sectors you named that they turn a blind eye to the risks involved.
13018,I‚Äôm sorry this is hard for you but maybe it‚Äôs something to start working on (rather than expecting other people to change their behavior)?
13019,It would be the first pandemic in centuries to do that soooo not very likely statically speaking.

13059,Sounds like you've had a rough time with Covid and blame preventive measures for how shitty of a year it's been.
13060,I hope you can reevaluate why you have a fear of getting vaccinated.
13061,The faster we're all vaccinated the faster these shitty lockdowns will end and life can get back to normal.
13062,Masks outside are pointless.
13063,"The only risk outside is if you‚Äôre having a conversation in close quarters, and if that‚Äôs the case nobody is wearing a mask anyway because you are presumably having a conversation with someone you trust."
13064,The chances of contracting Covid walking by someone is insanely small.
13065,And if you are vaccinated you have a better chance winning the lottery.
13066,At a minimum CDC should provide guidance that vaccinated people no longer need to wear masks outside.
13067,[deleted]
13068,I wouldn‚Äôt blame anyone either.
13069,that‚Äôs been the story the entire pandemic - individual versus collective interest.

13098,Depending on their state and age they may not have qualified until after they contracted COVID.
13099,And even if they qualified there‚Äôs the problem of appointments.
13100,"For example, my 63 year old relative in CA did not qualify to get vaccinated until April 1."
13101,They signed up as soon as they could and got an appointment in our smaller town for April 12.
13102,"Meanwhile I was vaccinated just 8 days later in a different state, because as a healthy adult in my 20s, I qualified on 4/19."
13103,I got a link from my state on and signed up for a mass vaccination appointment 2 days later.
13104,Not all states have efficient vaccination systems.

13199,Didn‚Äôt they say that a month ago
13200,"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us

Cases are going down in the US."
13201,"7 day moving average was 72,844 on April 14th, and has declined to 57,208 as of yesterday."
13202,So down 21% over the last 11 days.

13204,"[Tufecki ](https://www.theinsight.org/p/how-polarization-ate-our-brains)

In regard to Jones, there is no evidence that Florida has been under reporting other than her word."
13205,The COVID Tracking Project trusted Florida‚Äôs data and graded it highly.

13211,"Somehow, I feel like a spritz of watery sanitizer isn‚Äôt killing the covid if they‚Äôre all in contact with each other anyway."
13212,"Okay, thank you!"
13213,"10-30% of all cases (even asymptomatic cases) lead to long Covid, so case count is very important."
13214,We have overfocused on death and under focused on long term risk this whole time IMO.
13215,"I‚Äôve heard people both on Reddit and irl say that vaccines don‚Äôt prevent the spread, because it technically hasn‚Äôt been proven yet(as it would take a longer time to prove something like that) even though literally every other vaccines prevents the spread so it‚Äôs a common sense guess that this vaccine would prevent the spread."
13216,i upped my risk intake two weeks after my first shot as i knew i had more protection.
13217,"that said, i still hung out outside as much as possible and was kinda fussy about keeping windows open/airflow going if i wasnt outside."

13222,Read a damn science textbook and shut up.
13223,"EDIT: Also, you Trumpets are the whitest bunch I‚Äôve ever seen."
13224,"Grow up, JFC."
13225,"Per the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/vaers/index.html), the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is used to collect reports of adverse events after vaccination from the general public."
13226,This is primarily used to identify potential topics to further investigate with regards to vaccine reactions.
13227,"However, because the event data in VAERS is often not verified and is often self-reported, it should not be assumed that the adverse events in VAERS are actually associated with or cause by the vaccines, nor is it possible to estimate the frequency of these adverse events from these data."

13231,"but the VAERS system, they'll count every single thing on there."
13232,My Q-Brother recently posted a story about a guy who had a stroke 12 days after his vaccine.
13233,And how 3 different people (I don't recall the specifics.
13234,"but it was like the ER doc, the Neurologist and someone else) were all going to be uploading it as a death related to the vaccine."
13235,that would be 3 AE of death to 1 vaccine.
13236,and it's not even proven to be related.
13237,so.... they pick and choose when numbers work in their favor.

13255,I don‚Äôt think opening on vaccine numbers is good enough.
13256,If we don‚Äôt see that the vaccines are causing community spread to stop in the state then it isn‚Äôt time to open.
13257,"It SHOULD be the case that getting to a high enough percentage vaccinated translates into the end of community spread, but looking at the vaccine numbers seems like the wrong focus to me."
13258,[removed]
13259,"47.7% vaccinated with a first dose with a population of 12,801,989 means 6,106,548 have gotten the first dose, there are 9,358,833 adults in PA.

13280,I worked out like 2 hours after just fine.
13281,I‚Äôd love to see it!
13282,They either know what they‚Äôre doing or the shit they‚Äôve filled their head with has crystallized...
13283,There's no way to maintain 6 feet of space between you and others on a Manhattan street.
13284,Even in someplace like Central Park it would be next to impossible.
13285,The BCG is for TB.
13286,They usually take a skin sample afterwards.
13287,Dependants sometimes get that one too.
13288,My husband was in the Army.
13289,"They made me get all sorts of extra vaccines before they sent us to Alaska, because Alaska is an ""overseas assignment""."
13290,They told me I might score a false-positive on a TB test after getting that vaccine.
13291,I really wish BCG boosters were available to the public here.
13292,It protects against a lot of stuff besides TB.
13293,"I had a lot of upper respiratory infections growing up, but no issues for years after I got that shot."
13294,"I would pay for it, if I could get it"
13295,Directly from the reddexptert folks!
13296,"Great, good thing I don‚Äôt plan on visiting any playgrounds or elementary schools, and if I did I‚Äôd be wearing a mask and doing my part, I‚Äôm just tired of being told I have to consider what anti-vaxxers may do when it comes to resuming life."
13297,I would imagine several things.
13298,\#1.
13299,Greater acceptance == more people getting vaccinated == more money.
13300,\#2.
13301,"Once it gets fully approved, it locks other companies out from getting EUA on similar vaccines."
13302,Vaccines which have the same qualities can't get EUA if one already exist which does the same thing and has all the good testing and approval behind in.
13303,"Variants can submit for EUA...for example, a pill form, or something that targets kids, or something like that."
13304,"But not ""JACV""."
13305,So it's a form of market protection.
13306,"Well, here in Canada, every single potentially related blood clot case is front/center on the evening news."
13307,"I'm not sure what the stats are, but iirc, 5-6 cases (1 serious) over 1m doses, so about 1:150,000 chance, apparently."
13308,I have taken those odds.
13309,"For me, they're at least an order of magnitude better than getting covid."
13310,"Then they'll just fire you for an ""unrelated reason"" when that blows over because no one sides with the worker here"
13311,Lol right??
13312,One reason I was so quick to get the vaccine was because I was concerned about fertility risks
13313,Ikr.
13314,The weird caps should give it away but takes a while for folks to catch up yaknow
13315,"I‚Äôve seen people argue that they believe the CDC and the government is paying people $30,000 to lie about the cause of death."
13316,The biggest issue with these insane beliefs is the lack of rational thought around things like where money like that would come from and also simple questions like why?
13317,"We don't even want the vaccine now, just give us some money for the fuck up."
13318,"Reparations to rest of the world may be in order too as your defective vaccine has slowed down vaccinations by hogging production capacity, and also scaring people from getting vaccinated."
13319,That is all totally fair and I understand why the restrictions are still in place.
13320,"To be clear, I was just explaining why some people might want to travel into Canada regardless of whether they can visit restaurants etc."
13321,I agree that it‚Äôs still not the right time to let visitors in even just to see family.
13322,This is totally a friend of mine.
13323,She doesn‚Äôt understand that Covid isn‚Äôt going away.
13324,"She also doesn‚Äôt understand that many risks she took before Covid, such as driving in bad weather, are more likely to have a negative impact on her safety than Covid as she‚Äôs vaccinated."
13325,I don‚Äôt understand not resuming life because there‚Äôs a small chance you could get Covid or be severely sick.
13326,An extremely small chance.
13327,It's better than nothing and the day off of work we get nowüòÇüòÇ
13328,Unfortunately it is just about finished for that age group.
13329,It's going to top off between 82-85% in all likelihood due mostly to vaccine hesitancy (and a small % who can't get it for health reasons).
13330,"No, I quite literally did not say that at all."
13331,I said there is a heath benefit to wearing masks.
13332,"Your turn, Justin Trudeau."

13353,"India is actually a vaccine powerhouse, they really just need the USA to unleash vaccine precursors, which is exactly what they did today."
13354,"As much as Canada needs their AZ licensed vaccines, I‚Äôm hoping India temporarily restricts exports and focuses on domestic demand to stop the bleeding."
13355,You're comparing a three- or four-month period for the risk of a breakthrough infection to a lifetime risk of getting struck by lightning.
13356,"That doesn't wash.

To be clear, I'm with you insofar as the risk of breakthrough infection looking to be quite low, but any comparison to lightning should be made on the same time scale."
13357,"Ah never knew about those, those are definitely safe?"
13358,Not at all.
13359,Keep stacking!
13360,Yeah because they took it serious before

13364,I have!

13366,What about the other way around?
13367,One thing I didn't expect to see happen is people trying to solve the covid problem using their favorite strategy.

&gt;The current wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in the national capital could have been fuelled by the UK variant as its prevalence in genomes sequenced nearly doubled from the second to the last week of March, Sujeet Singh, director of the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), said on Friday."
13373,"&gt;  
&gt;Data released by the NCDC says more than 400 cases of the UK strain and 76 of the Indian double mutant were found in Delhi."

&gt;Times of India:  
&gt;  
&gt; Covid-19: Of 15,000 virus sequences, 11% comprise of UK, SA and Brazil variants; UK strain dominant in India"
13375,I think it‚Äôs because of our contractual requirements not to export the vaccine.
13376,I think it‚Äôs due to the instability of the vaccine and it‚Äôs need to stay refrigerated.
13377,He and Monica Ghandi are my two favorites.
13378,They give the facts and balance risks and optimism.
13379,hilarious timing after people on this site were just whining about supposed outdoor 'superspreader' events over the weekend
13380,Less than 30% of the population is fully vaccinated.
13381,"Wear a mask, don't go places where other people aren't wearing a mask."
13382,Spend time with people you know who are fully vaccinated.
13383,It's a precaution worth taking.
13384,There are already too many stories about minor cases having terrible effects and we're still learning and wearing a mask is a super easy thing to do.
13385,Stay safe!
13386,I would like to add that if you look at where the UK variant is hitting.
13387,"The cases rise exponentially faster than the OG strain in hard hit areas like UK and Michigan, but fall very rapidly."
13388,It seems regardless of lockdowns in Michigan because they have been more mobile.
13389,This data leads me to hypothesize A.)
13390,That the cases are far undercounted and the variant is far less lethal than we originally anticipated B.)
13391,That there are multi variant factors that each hotspot had going for them at the time of the surge that shortened the length of it compared to the OG strain (ex.
13392,"lockdown, seasonality, vaccination rate, etc)"
13393,"Not most, ~50%"
13394,Thanks.
13395,Btw not sure why people are downvoting me?

13409,"Then you go there, they made me fill out a very long intake form (why in the world do you need my Drivers License number), and then you had to certify if you were getting a shot based on allowed criteria (which were weeks out of date)."

13411,And shot two was worse!

13436,"Official deaths, yes."
13437,Not sure if it's wrong or just misleading.
13438,MA just started phase 3 of of the vaccination plan on April 19.

13455,I highly suggest watching the Emanuel Marcone interview from last Sunday that aired on Face the Nation.
13456,India has the worlds largest vaccine producer.
13457,The knowledge isn‚Äôt the concern.
13458,The Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech are both supply constrained not knowledge constrained.
13459,Factories are useless without supply chains and the worlds vaccine supply chain is at its limit already.
13460,They are so far behind that by the time their product hits the market it will have a very limited application.
13461,MA is going to be fascinating to watch.
13462,Less than 3% of the state refuses to be vaccinated.
13463,"However, the cape has a healthy amount of tourists, including many that have been pretty anti covid restrictions."

13465,"Be interesting to see what that does to infection rates, particularly in Barnstable county."
13466,Measles has been eradicated in the USA but sure smallpox they eradicated it by vaccinating everyone from it...all future births from the vaccinated people were also protected from it too.

13478,I don't care what they have.
13479,"It looks like a third world country

America had the most incompetent and neglegent president to date but America is doing much better."
13480,So ur statement doesn't mean much
13481,USA is in charge of Modi's election rallies and an indian religious holiday.
13482,"So selfish of the USA, ordering those things in India."
13483,And we wonder why demand for the vaccine is waning.
13484,"I would be concerned of not being free to travel as an EU citizen while others can, all because of the Commission's utter failure to do its job."
13485,Or to have to endure curfews like right now in Germany later in the year.
13486,How can they plan for summer holidays if we're making the lockdown more restrictive?
13487,"If vaccines were required and social distancing still was a thing, I would riot."
13488,I highly doubt college kids will not be partying this next semester.
13489,[citation needed]
13490,&gt;I hope they will accept people with only 1 vaccination.
13491,I'd be very surprised if the EU or any country would make that kind of exception.
13492,It'd send a bad message about getting immunized as directed.
13493,"By the same logic, CBSA would grant half-vaccinated visitors as much freedom as they would to fully-vaccinated visitors."
13494,I don't think that it would go down well here.
13495,A lot of people were/are freaking out about flights from India to the point Trudeau that quickly and practically reversed himself [from saying earlier this week that travel restrictions are/were effective](https://www.kelownanow.com/news/news/National_News/Trudeau_defends_Canada_s_travel_restrictions_as_effective_could_suspend_flights_from_India/).
13496,"By the way, [the reality that not all vaccines are equal is a simmering problem in Ireland](https://www.independent.ie/world-news/coronavirus/60s-age-group-may-facemore-restricted-summer-due-to-three-month-astrazeneca-vaccine-interval-40345829.html)."
13497,People who are getting vaccinated with AZ this spring are cluing in that they won't be in the clear for this summer as soon as others getting Pfizer or Moderna at the same time because of the 12-week spread for giving AZ's doses versus the 3 to 6 week spread used for the mRNA vaccines.
13498,Being half vaccinated doesn't ultimately count for much beyond reducing the rate of hospitalization and severe illness for the short run.
13499,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Not many people in Canada will have the double vaccination by then."
13500,This is all an unfortunate and emerging downside of the gross prioritization up to now in giving out first doses.
13501,It sounds good that someone may get the first shot earlier than expected (by late June?)
13502,but we're building a huge backlog of people who will need/demand their second shots this summer.
13503,"Given constraints of time, labour and capital, this backlog would naturally decrease the rate at which young(er), low(er) risk people as a whole get their first shots."
13504,"Nowadays, over 90% of the appointments at a clinic are for the first shot but by the summer, the mix of people lining up for their shot will be a more balanced mix of old(er), high(er)-risk people getting their second shot and young(er), low(er) risk people getting their first shot."
13505,Only those lucky enough to score a shot of J&amp;J can avoid the twilight zone of being half vaccinated.
13506,100% the truth.
13507,I was at the gym today and overheard a couple young guys like ‚Äúwhy get the vaccine when we still have to wear masks and can‚Äôt eat out that‚Äôs some b.s.!
13508,My parents got it but I‚Äôm not getting it for now!‚Äù

13511,"I do think there's something to be said about antivaxxers more likely to not follow covid restrictions and more likely to be infected, tho."

13514,I'm 100% pro vaccination and I agree its our way out of this.

13522,Then stop trying to scare people.
13523,The vaccine is the way out of this.
13524,"Unfortunately, there has been little indication of normal life returning, regardless."
13525,You have fully vaccinated people who are still worried they're going to get covid.
13526,"I've said it before: the message get vaccinated, continue to wear masks, and social distance is just not going to incentivize people getting the vaccine."
13527,Oh totally.
13528,I still check worldometer to get a quick overview of what's going on.
13529,I just wonder sometimes what everything there is coming from is all.
13530,I got the second Pfizer shot yesterday and feeling like crap today.
13531,"My whole body aches, nausea, and lethargic."
13532,I know it's just my body building up resistance so I don't mind it too much.
13533,"They're quoting a different sentence, and he repeatedly makes clear that he's saying both things."
13534,"The quote where they got ""really low"": 

&gt; *But when you look around at the common sense situation, the risk is really low, especially if you‚Äôre vaccinated*

He is being unambiguous that it is both really low, and more low if vaccinated."
13535,"A false negative or could be involved, or maybe a positive person sneezed on a hand rail before everyone boarded, or maybe someone who was negative gave a good-bye kiss to someone who was positive before boarding."
13536,The headline makes it sound like this is supposed to be a huge mystery.
13537,"""We‚Äôre going to give every single one of these people, the people that already stepped up, our young people that have already stepped up and been vaccinated, and every single one of our young people, we‚Äôre going to give a $100 savings bond to every single one that steps up and takes their vaccines,‚Äù said Governor Justice."
13538,He also announced it will be retroactive
13539,Not even close
13540,I am so pissed off.
13541,I made my pfizer appointment yesterday.
13542,"I was finally ready to get it, then I saw this: ""Israel said probing link between Pfizer shot and heart problem in men under 30""  https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-said-probing-link-between-pfizer-shot-and-heart-problem-in-men-under-30/

I am a male under 30."
13543,"No pre-existing conditions and have been quarantining for the past year (don't ask, it's complicated)."
13544,"How am I supposed to compare the risks of getting covid (low, not zero) with the risks of getting this problem (low, not zero)."
13545,I can't.
13546,I don't know what to do.
13547,I don't get it.
13548,J&amp;J was paused for 15 clots and 3 deaths.
13549,Israel has seen 62 cases and 2 deaths from myocarditis after Pfizer.
13550,Why isn't the FDA pausing Pfizer?
13551,Why hasn't the US government made an announcement about this?
13552,Why do I have to hear this from a foreign news headline and not from a reputable drug agency monitoring side effects?
13553,I can't do the risk/benefit analysis in my head.
13554,"The only choice I have is to ""wait one more week"" to see what if anyone makes of this new problem (pfizer and heart inflammation in young men)."
13555,You expect a massive bureaucracy like WHO will set them up for making these vaccines within a year?
13556,"Imo, what you‚Äôre calling for could be a good prep for the next pandemic, but for now we need to ensure we‚Äôre supplying enough raw materials to countries that can mass produce vaccines and that‚Äôs exactly what we‚Äôre doing going forward."
13557,"Setting up your own vaccine manufacturing capacity is no joke, if it was easy, most developed countries would‚Äôve done that by now."
13558, [Effectiveness of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a cohort of healthcare personnel | Clinical Infectious Diseases | Oxford Academic (oup.com)](https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciab361/6253721)
13559,"Also known as ""Non-confederate Virginia """
13560,Lets wait for some days
13561,"&gt; The states just need to come out and say once we hit X% of the total population that all mask mandates, capacity limits, etc will be dropped."
13562,"And when they don't hit that number, for a bunch of different reasons, then what?"
13563,"I get the idea, but that's setting a dangerous benchmark that we have no way of really ensuring we can hit."
13564,"I wish everyone gets the vaccine, but as soon as demand really starts flagging, then open everything up and it's on those not vaccinated if they get sick."
13565,There's really no other option.
13566,Preventing disease costs way less money than treating it
13567,"&gt;  IMO it's entirely possible that AZ and JJ are the better vaccines, they just came around at the wrong times."
13568,"Eh, real world data is showing &gt;95% effectiveness of the mRNA vaccines out in the wild."
13569,"AZ and JJ might well be **as good**, but would be close to impossible to do appreciably better than that."
13570,What are you talking about?
13571,Bars are not shut down in Massachusetts
13572,Why is it some people preach ‚Äúpersonal responsibility‚Äù right up until something like masks or hand washing during a pandemic and suddenly it‚Äôs not a thing anymore?
13573,Spoke too my grandparents in Oporto they said they had the first dose last week and only my grandmother got a bit of bruising around the site of injection otherwise she felt quite good.
13574,Glad things are looking better for the country.
13575,PORTUGALCARALHO!
13576,Ive never been a fan of arguments like you are making.
13577,You could invalidate virtually every good idea by nitpicking about 'what if' fringe cases.
13578,Instead why dont you come up with an alternative that you think would work better?
13579,"It says total residents though, not adults."
13580,"I know only adults are eligible right now, but soon you will have 12-15 added to that pool."
13581,And that ends up right around 72% vaccinated which is probably a solid goal.
13582,The goal should come with an ending of all restrictions though.
13583,"Yeah, I mean I don't know anything more than the real information seems to be coming from the crematoriums."
13584,"Since Hindus rely on cremation in lieu of burial, you can follow the fires unfortunately (harder to hide than mass burial pits)."
13585,Listening to the news on the weekend it's anecdotal but there are reports of crematoriums burning thousands of bodies in cities with official tolls in the dozens.
13586,The new problem is actually crematoriums *melting* because they weren't designed to be employed so consistently and to such capacity.
13587,Public parks and town squares are being converted into ad hoc funeral pyres.
13588,It's horrific.
13589,How can someone lose credibility when we‚Äôre *still* learning things about a novel virus?
13590,"We‚Äôve made great strides, but people were calling for his head like a month into the pandemic as if we knew anything about how this virus acts."
13591,It was and is mind boggling.
13592,[deleted]
13593,They also involve activities where you likely have to get really close to someone else.
13594,To me the takeaway is that outdoors are perfectly safe if you are keeping a somewhat safe distance.
13595,I got my shots from them.
13596,I guess I assumed the people jabbing me were already safe.
13597,Are there current quarantine restrictions at the moment even if you are in Canada for the interim?
13598,It‚Äôs too late for me but just to see how much of an idiot I was.
13599,I'm surprised that 75+ is slightly lower than 65-74.
13600,"It's not a big difference, but I thought that age group was the highest."
13601,"The problem was people equating BLM protests (outdoors, with masks) to places like my city here in Nashville prematurely reopening bars and restaurants (indoors, too much capacity, unenforced masks) as if the two were somehow on the same page."
13602,Because in many places local doctors offices still would not be able to meet demand.
13603,I got my 2nd shot at fema site last week and the line was huuuuge.
13604,I cannot imagine local healthcare being able to handle that.
13605,At this point we just don't know.
13606,Trial participants are going to be monitored for a few years to see when the protection starts to wane.
13607,That‚Äôs incredibly sad and unfortunate for him.
13608,"Keep in mind, while the shots are highly effective, there will be breakthrough cases."
13609,"There will be, sadly, even a rare death."
13610,"The media will certainly report on it, given the rarity and the ‚Äúclickbait‚Äù headlines such situations can produce."
13611,"But, this happens with every vaccine known to man."
13612,"The vaccinated sometimes are infected and very, very few of those cases result in death."
13613,Read the FULL article.
13614,Unless you live in a hovel idk how Texas is less affordable for you than Ontario.
13615,"Then again Toronto is my only frame of reference for your province

Anyway it‚Äôs alright here."
13616,"Cheap, lots of jobs."
13617,"Traffic sucks, we don‚Äôt have legal weed like you guys, and our healthcare system is kinda stupid but that‚Äôs in every state."
13618,[deleted]
13619,"Wow, do you get a boner when you see an orphanage on fire or something?"
13620,Yeah its 3x the dose of the Pfizer so that could easily explain it being slightly better with 1 dose.
13621,Because your logic doesn't really comport with how people act.
13622,"Performative measures with no impact,like repeated surface cleaning or unnecessary outdoor masking are frequently and repeatedly cited by people who cast doubt on all anti covid measures"
13623,The CDC also recommends cooking beef higher than rare/medium rare.
13624,Sometimes you have to weigh risks and not wait to be told what to do.

13626,[removed]
13627,Like by MDW?
13628,Taxes.
13629,Reopening earlier.
13630,Reduce medical costs directly sterling from covid
13631,Where do you get this data (or are you aggregating it yourself)?
13632,"&gt; Knowing how overly-cautious this administration 

Not to get too in the weeds on this but the other party is absolutely going to use this as a rallying cry to try and sweep the house in 2022."
13633,And you know what?
13634,They might be really successful with that strategy.
13635,I really feel the cautious crowd is growing smaller everyday.
13636,Sure reddit is a bit of an echo chamber and it seems like on here there are a lot of people who advocate for extending the restrictions but a lot of people (probably the vast majority) are really fed up with restrictions that make no sense and I hear it more and more out in public especially as more people get vaccinated.
13637,They really are out of touch with most of America on this.
13638,Of course I understand.
13639,We booked in periods of 6 months.
13640,"The factors become weather, lack of being able to get refunds for flights (so forced into it), and optimism has a role in it."
13641,Air Canada at the time would not allow us to refund our flight and so we were stuck with 2k sitting in their pockets for 2 years.
13642,"Unless we wanted to reschedule a year out, but our flights had nothing planned that far out."
13643,Not too much of a choice when months of savings are in limbo.
13644,&gt;Colleges requiring students to get vaccinated but telling them they'll still be wearing masks and having to take online classes aren't helping whatsoever.
13645,"I'm not sure if college kids specifically aren't getting vaccinated because of this, but it definitely contributes to the overall negative tone of the conversation that alludes to this idea that normalcy isn't allowed this year no matter what."
13646,Why would people rush to get vaccinated when there's literally zero urgency from our leaders to get society fully open again?
13647,You probably should if you think a handful of lives are worth more than the entire tourism industry of Israel.
13648,I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôd do a better job than the people you‚Äôd stake your mortgage on if they don‚Äôt understand they overvalue human lives that much.

13650,"üé∂ When I say *""Just two""* you say *""more weeks!"
13651,"""* üé∂"
13652,New England has the highest rate of vaccination in the entire US
13653,I'll answer this.
13654,I'm not as extreme as the poster you're replying to; the end of mask _mandates_ won't drive me out of all stores.
13655,"However, I'm also not in this sub's meta of ""yep I'm fully vaxxed so the moment mandates end the mask goes in the trash""."
13656,There are several reasons.
13657,"One is that it makes other people around me more comfortable (I live in a very ""pro mask"" area) and frankly, putting a piece of cloth over my mouth isn't a big deal for me."
13658,"If it was I might feel differently, but.. it really doesn't bother me?"
13659,"It's already been nice to be able to step down to an earloop mask instead of double-masking an N95, I really don't mind continuing to mask up for the comfort of others."
13660,"Another factor is that I have other non-COVID reasons for wanting to wear a mask sometimes, and I want to help promote masking as a normal thing to do."
13661,"No, I'm not saying ""promote making every American wear a mask all the time forever"", I'm saying ""make it not weird when someone wears a mask because they WANT to"" - because I want to wear a mask when it's pollen season."
13662,"And I want it to be normalized during flu season, because I have seasonal allergies, and I often don't know that cold symptoms are cold symptoms and not just more allergies until moderately into it."
13663,So why not wear a mask anytime I feel a little off and maybe spare someone a cold?
13664,"And frankly, I'll probably take my N95 with me anytime I'm on public transit from now on, because the subway is a disgusting pit and I don't want whatever minor cold someone next to me has."
13665,"Again, not COVID, but a greater awareness of how many respiratory illnesses can be better protected against."
13666,Plus I really don't want to breathe in diesel fumes on the bus.
13667,"So a lot of it is having gotten used to wearing unobtrusive masks, and others having gotten used to _me_ wearing them."
13668,"And I expect some of the places I most want to go, and some of the friends I want to hang out with, to have stricter requirements than the relevant government requirements, so there's that as well."
13669,"The final bit, and this is ""controversial"" here, is that vaccine efficacy is very high but not 100%, and might be somewhat lower against some variants."
13670,"Yeah, I'm pretty much 100% protected against _dying_ from COVID now, but some variants look like the efficacy may be more like 75% for infection, and even if my viral load is low I still have contact with immunocompromised people, so I'd rather be extra careful."
13671,If cases surge to very high levels again - say in an area that has low vaccine uptake - I'll be masking back up because I don't see any reason to roll the dice any more than I have to.
13672,"Ditto for the peak of flu season in a bad year, even though I get my flu shot every year - more relevant for flu, really, since the flu vaccine has that whole thing with strain prediction and sometimes they don't guess right."
13673,There was a pretty extensive contact tracing study from the start of the outbreak.
13674,I think they found 1 case of outdoor transmission.
13675,A guy stopped to talk to his friend at close range for an extended period.
13676,Caveats about study from china of course.
13677,But if they're good at anything it's tracking their citizens.
13678,Edit: If I remember correctly it was out of a thousand or so cases?
13679,[removed]
13680,But you got access to the vaccine earlier than us.
13681,So how was that fair?
13682,Thank Christ.
13683,As someone who is outside at various places with my kids often my face is wrecked from masks.
13684,I‚Äôll continue wearing it inside as long as required but the science does not support it outdoors (and never has).
13685,Hence I am going to be joyous when this reg finally ceases
13686,&gt;I mean that can be true for some.
13687,But you don't expect so many passengers to catch it.
13688,"If they are traveling to Hong Kong they would be high income travelers and as we all know higher income travelers tend to be more educated and more COVID conscious, and therefore will take greater precautions."
13689,That's a lot of assumptions to make only to still miss the point entirely there bud...
13690,I kind of expect a bunch of these will go to Canada and Mexico.
13691,"Its in the best interest of the US to quench the coronavirus pandemic in its nearest neighbours, so normal travel can resume."
13692,[removed]
13693,Of course things can happen - but every week we are getting to a point where it is more and more likely that we will reach that point.
13694,Let me explain.
13695,"Just for the sake of it, let‚Äôs assume Pfizer and Moderna deliver as planned."
13696,They have until now and massive investments have been put into the upscale of their production.
13697,Then we assume that AstraZeneca only delivers half of what they have indicated and the same for J&amp;J - we simply do not know how much they will deliver - so we should be extremely cautious at this point.
13698,"If we add these doses together, we should have enough to fully vaccinate 80% of the Adult EU population by mid-July."
13699,"This leaves us with a decent 10pp for delays, spillage and transport time - so 70% fully vaccinated by mid-July does not sound so crazy anymore."
13700,I can‚Äôt wait to see my colleagues and not hear my neighbor‚Äôs shitty dogs barking all day but I‚Äôm not looking forward to the office itself.
13701,My apartment is cheap as shit and it‚Äôs more pleasant to be in than my office which I‚Äôm sure cost a pretty penny whenever it was built.
13702,"I‚Äôve got better lighting, food, amenities (like a bed and a cat), close to good coffee shops etc."
13703,Uhh... India has tons of issues besides Covid.
13704,This is just getting attention because Covid gets a lot of attention in the media.
13705,"Things were not ""fairly normal"" over there as far as decent living conditions for over a billion human beings."
13706,"In Philadelphia it's not officially mandated I don't think, but it is 100% socially unacceptable to be unmasked outdoors, unless you're sitting out in a field somewhere or something."
13707,The only people I see out and about without masks on are cops and road construction crews
13708,"India had just 20k cases in Jan'21, after that UK &amp; South Africa mutant was found and then, these new mutants mutated more."
13709,Many experts in Jan'21 asked to stop flights from there but no one listened.
13710,"If all flights were cancelled wasn't there huge probability that cases dipping from 90k in Sep2020 to 20k in Jan2021 might had continued to fall which means with no net new variant from international travel, high chances of virus to die out."
13711,Forget about if all countries have stopped flights from China last year &amp; later with each other..so many examples.
13712,Its amazing we r still debating or people want to risk lives just for travelling &amp; having fun.
13713,Can't they travel domestic
13714,"Pretty sure the turning point was in January, but thanks."
13715,I'm really not a fan of civil servants treating policy clarifications like Apple Keynotes.
13716,"If he can't announce anything at this time due to waiting for more evidence or more information or *something,* he should tell us why."
13717,"His constituency is absolutely, completely entitled to total transparency."
13718,"Man I had shingles when I was 26 and it is MISERABLE, wouldn‚Äôt wish that on anyone and wish I had access to that vaccine back in the day."

13741,Not just poorer countries.
13742,There are lot of developed countries that could use vaccine doses.
13743,And frankly we need to also plan for booster doses on top of that.
13744,Thank you
13745,Awesomeness.
13746,Nice job Israel
13747,"True, we might be done with the virus, but I do not think it is anywhere near finished with us!"
13748,"Just a Philadelphia reporting anecdotally - Here in the city I can honestly say 90%+ of people outside are wearing masking; the 10% being joggers, smokers, and crazy homeless people."
13749,"In the suburbs it's more hit and miss, but I'd say 40-50% of people just outdoors doing things like walking their dogs or talking to neighbors in the driveway are wearing masks."
13750,Alex Berenson banned from twitter is a starting point
13751,is there a chart somewhere?
13752,Philadelphia FEMA last week only had 50% use (6000 shots per day regular capacity)
13753,Feels similar here in NM also.
13754,I will be surprised if any state hits 90% uptake.
13755,"&gt;  IDK if it's morally wrong or right

It's immoral *not* to do it."

13759,"The fastest way to get people to do something, other than to threaten violence, is to pay them."
13760,3.
13761,Pay people to get vaccinated.
13762,"And financially, the pandemic is doing *way* more damage than would be done by giving everyone a hundred bucks to get vaccinated."
13763,I mean... as much as we laugh at FL and TX.
13764,Theyve been opened for months now and have acquired herd immunity.
13765,So I think we are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.
13766,No parent would knowingly risk their child's life.
13767,I can't imagine the stress of having a wife in the ICU and isolating at home with two sick kids as the sole breadwinner.

13781,"Reducing spread is key to herd immunity, so 90% protection from infection is better than 70% protection from infection - i.e."
13782,from a spread perspective it *may* be better to have 60% of the population with a 90% effective vaccine than 70% with a 70% effective vaccine (obviously any vaccine is better than none!
13783,I'd rather have 60% at 90% and 10% at 70%!).
13784,"In addition, protection from hospitalization will likely track headline efficacy - higher headline efficacy means better protection from severe COVID and hospitalization."
13785,[This is a good collection of studies](https://www.publichealthontario.ca/-/media/documents/ncov/covid-wwksf/2021/04/wwksf-vaccine-effectiveness.pdf?la=en).
13786,"Basically, the tl;dr is that Pfizer is likely about 85-95% effective from hospitalization / severe COVID after the second dose and about 60-80% effective against hospitalization/severe COVID 14+ days after the first dose."
13787,"There is very limited real world JnJ data, but it is likely JnJ will closely track 1-dose of AZ or Pfizer which would give it around 70-80% effectiveness against hospitalization."
13788,"The clinical studies themselves are unfortunately limited - most studies get the headline of ""100% efficacy against severe COVID"", but that is with very low statistical power - and with a biased population (most clinical studies looked at relatively healthy &lt;65 year olds)."
13789,"The vaccines are tragically *least* effective in the elderly because of weaker immune systems (or even worse, the immunocompromised - it is safe to take it for them, but less than half of immunocompromised individuals get a high antibody response)."
13790,"All vaccines are still HIGHLY effective when compared to most vaccines, but the myth that they are 100% effective against severe COVID and hospitalization is dangerous because it leads to thinking like the above."
13791,Unfair to us 37 year olds.
13792,Other coronaviruses have a proofreading mechanism.
13793,It keeps the mutation rate low which is good for us but it also allows for a larger and more complex viral genome.
13794,It also makes antiviral development more difficult.
13795,It's possible for any gene to be lost to a mutation but it probably wouldn't be evolutionarily beneficial.
13796,Scientists have developed such mutants in the lab.
13797,Pfizer is.
13798,WVa has already made clinics at high schools where they sent home letters to every parent with a student 16+ and let the whole family sign up and get their shots together at the school

13806,"Most of the bottlenecks are in bottles and needles (don't need to release patents to get those facilities up and running) and on raw ingredients themselves (again, don't need patents released there; just raw ingredients)."
13807,"That, and finishing/filling locations."
13808,Moderna just today announced a deal with Sanofi to have them finish/bottle since that's the easiest step to not mess up and require dumping double digit millions of doses down the drain.
13809,"So, where are all the new bottle and needle manufacturing plants going up at?"
13810,Are finishing and bottling plants showing up in these countries?
13811,"No, because the raw material to make the glass is the shortage, and opening a new mine and getting it up and running takes years."
13812,"Heck, for bottling plants you don't even need raw materials; just a really really clean and organized space with some machinery, but those are all on back order everywhere also."
13813,"I haven't seen a ton of articles on this and how they're gearing up to get it done yet; honestly, if you have some it'd be great to read them because while searching I haven't come across a lot of concrete information."

13868,They are conditionally hinting at July for them coming off.
13869,Also remember that they are focusing on a vaccine that can be stored in much more attainable temperatures than Pfizer/Moderna which require specialty storage at deep freeze temperatures.

14052,My very red rural county grandma is finally getting it after refusing.
14053,Most of the higher educated conservatives I know have already gotten it.
14054,"It‚Äôs the high school education or less people that have been refusing, from my experience."
14055,It's not the hardest part.
14056,"There is just a bottleneck for fill and finish operations in mRNA vaccine producers, which have never produced vaccines on a large scale."
14057,Fill and finish is a generic operation that can be done by vaccine companies without experience in mRNA technology.
14058,"&gt; we'll be at a point where there are more Americans who don't need to wear a mask than Americans who should be wearing one 

And not to forget, the majority of the remainder don't give a shit and don't want to wear a mask, and probably will not."
14059,2nd week of May would be my guess
14060,We are getting our Pfizer and Moderna from Europe.
14061,We'll take more.
14062,As much as we can get.
14063,"IIRC, there are 8M Pfizer due to arrive next month."
14064,IP freely?
14065,Is there an IP freely here?
14066,There's plenty of other examples.
14067,For example the persistent theatre around surface contamination.
14068,"My guess is, he‚Äôs smarter than you!"
14069,"Yes, mostly because of high demand."
14070,"Not as many are vaccine hesitant, so it hasn't slowed down yet."
14071,"The state's, however, probably could do more per day."
14072,MA has even asked to redirect doses for that reason
14073,"Okay, why would we want anything other than that?"
14074,Seriously.
14075,"Why would we lift mask restrictions completely, if a substantial amount of people aren‚Äôt vaccinated?"
14076,50-60% of the population being vaccinated does not get the job done.
14077,"Am I wrong for thinking that if a large amount of people (let‚Äôs be honest, there is a frightening amount of Americans who have no intentions on getting vaccinated) don‚Äôt get the vaccine, then the virus has a large chance of mutating to a degree that could render our current vaccines and our current treatments ineffective?"
14078,"So wouldn‚Äôt getting rid of all or most masks, without getting 70-80% of our population vaccinated, put us in some kind of purgatory between full blown pandemic and being done with the pandemic?"
14079,"In NE Philly I would say that a majority of people don't wear them outside, and the people who actually do are mostly older."
14080,I would imagine it's probably different in Center City and other more dense neighborhoods.
14081,Yes it's a republican trifecta but that has nothing to do with vaccine uptake.
14082,WVa has the highest vaccine uptake in school children in the 97% plus range.
14083,So it's a very provaccine culture here
14084,So even though I'm following the CDC guidelines I'm still wrong because my reasoning is wrong?
14085,"My understanding that the spread between ""meeting contract"" and what was expected is high."
14086,"Like, a 3-5x multiplier."
14087,"Vaccines are tough and it's very easy to get low yield, with the number going up by 5x or more as you dial it in."
14088,"My understanding is that the Belgian plant is the only one meeting the ""contract"", but the contractual number was the lowest possible acceptable, and that they were expecting 3-5x more out of it per week at this point."
14089,I wonder how well folks are masking and social distancing?
14090,Indian culture is 100% foreign to me so I have no idea what the norms are around those behaviors.
14091,It's really not good for your gut.
14092,Tell them they are hurting themselves and others by doing that.
14093,"&gt;The vaccination rate in some rural counties is higher than in urban ones, but he percentage of people vaccinated has barely risen in weeks."
14094,A handful of counties have been rejecting shipments for the past three or four weeks.
14095,Last week was the first time Barton County has ever turned down doses.
14096,Buy them some fruit wash as alternative?
14097,We use the kind from Trader Joe‚Äôs and really like it

14286,or could it be that while working for trump he knew that if he flat out refuted STRONGLY trump he would have been replaced very quickly with a yes man that would have gladly agreed with everything he said and told the american public to use something unsafe and unproven like hydroxychloroquine?

14291,"In my area, the FEMA site was in a very poorly chosen location, about a 2 hour drive from our most populous counties."
14292,While I can understand *why* it was chosen (it is in a moderately sized city that was hit hard by the early waves of Covid and has a high population of POCs and other vulnerable populations) there was already a pretty significant surplus of vaccinations there and the populations that needed it the most and it was most likely intending to target - farm workers - weren‚Äôt going to go to a FEMA site and needed a very different vaccination strategy.
14293,They didn‚Äôt get nearly the traffic they‚Äôd hoped for with that site.
14294,One person's freedom ends where another person's freedom begins.
14295,"They think they have the right to impose their own beliefs on others, thus restricting those peoples' freedom."
14296,Their selfishness prevents them from seeing the contradiction.
14297,Can you start exporting for fucks sake???
14298,?
14299,Disagree with this heavily.
14300,People easily can and will lie about being vaccinated so that they don't have to wear a mask.
14301,"You may be fine on a personal level, but on a macro level this kind of behavior will ensure that covid ends much more slowly."
14302,I'd rather suck it up and wear a mask for a couple more months than allow everyone to go maskless and have the pandemic continue well into the fall.

14312,Your getting downvoted cause your twisting words and stating inaccuracies.
14313,The Pfizer ceo said that a *likely* scenario might involve a booster shot.
14314,And that that scenario needed to be confirmed using trials and tests.
14315,"I agree that boosters will probably be needed but he most definitely did not say ""inevitable""."
14316,I think another big problem is most vaccine appointments are during 8 AM to 5 PM which is‚Ä¶when the majority of the country is at work?
14317,Instead of Biden giving tax credits for offices to give workers time off to get the vaccine (which aren‚Äôt being super widely adopted) why not open some 24hr walk in sites?

14324,"I agree, until the FDA approved they were considered experimental."
14325,"Thankfully, they approved these vaccines."
14326,Even post vaccination there is a small risk of serious disease and even death.
14327,"As well, the more people unvaccinated the more spread and thus more mutation which could cause vaccine induced immunity to be less protective."
14328,"Overall, getting vaccinated greatly reduces your risk, but lots of other people being unvaccinated still poses some risk to everyone."
14329,I don't understand why this is an issue anymore.
14330,The people who are complaining about mass vaccinations are the same people complaining that the economy is shut down due to covid.
14331,The vaccine solves both of these problems.

14341,20 years ago?
14342,There have been warnings about climate change since the 80s at least.
14343,Ever heard of Captain Planet?
14344,"I even just watched an episode of Star Trek the Next Generation that mentions global warming, I mean that's just a strange thing to claim."
14345,"It has even been pretty sufficiently proven that energy executives had done research into global warming and determined even as far back as the 60s that what they were doing, with oil, gas and coal, was doing damage to the planet."
14346,"There's no doubt that climate change has been smeared and suppressed by the media for decades, but that doesn't mean it's only been a thing for 20 years."
14347,&gt;You can't really blame people for making decisions based on their understanding at the time.
14348,I can if they had the knowledge and didn't use it.
14349,"The worst polluters are companies, not individuals, and some certainly knew and didn't care."
14350,"I'm less concerned about the individuals untied to massive industries, but the younger generations don't really care about the distinction at this point because nothing will bring their future back."
14351,Sounds like you friend doesn't know how a medical report works.
14352,"If you had a cold and crashed your car, the report should _absolutely_ note that."
14353,"Being sick could easily have been a cause in the crash, so it should be noted."
14354,"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm

You can make your own mind up."
14355,"But ""kids"" are certainly more likely to die from car accidents and for many age groups flu."
14356,"Yeah, I'm on the verge of going no contact with my entire family (other than my sisters) due to various things they deem ""political"" but to me it's morals, ethics, and human rights."
14357,It effin' sucks.
14358,"I'm sorry, fellow Redditor"
14359,If you don't have kids or immunocompromised people at home it really doesn't matter.
14360,The US will reach herd immunity - whether through vaccination or infection.
14361,Considering the relative stability of the healthcare system it's hard to care if antivaxxers want to achieve immunity through infection or not.
14362,He was not ‚Äúpissed-off‚Äù he was amused by the stupidity of the assertion.
14363,Why do the media always revert to those false descriptions.
14364,Does it generate more clicks if you insert those types of words?
14365,It pisses me of way beyond furious hatred for statements like that.
14366,"We haven't even had a strain that vaccines don't work against, though."
14367,Of course everyone should get vaccinated.
14368,But the comment I responded to is afraid of some mutated strain that's deadlier *and* escapes vaccine immunity.
14369,"Presumably, they're not afraid of that with other viruses, but that makes zero sense."
14370,"Other viruses mutate, and there's nothing to stop them from mutating to escape our vaccines."
14371,Being afraid of this one but not others is nonsense.
14372,&gt;Vaccines are less effective than masks.
14373,"This is one of the reasons why people can't be bothered to get vaccinated and end up ""sick"" for a day with side effects."
14374,&gt;But they also found frustratingly few papers that detailed the settings or clearly compared indoor and outdoor situations.
14375,That right there is the money shot.
14376,"&gt; Our takeaway from this is that it‚Äôs not impossible to get an infection outdoors, 

That's science for ""it's pretty much impossible to get an infection outdoors unless you're like making out with someone."""
14377,"Everything we're doing to stop COVID stops the flu as well, and we have more natural immunity to the flu."
14378,I didn't have any cold symptoms this winter and I usually have at least a couple bouts.
14379,That's due to the measures we are taking.
14380,"If you can stop the spread early, the numbers will be orders of magnitude less due to exponential growth."
14381,Yes there is.
14382,"Well, 2 vaccines have been approved so far."
14383,Zabdeno/Mvabea by Janssen and rVSV-ZEBOV by the Public Health Agency of Canada and Merck.
14384,More ebola vaccines are still being develloped.
14385,Why Do You Care If You're Neighbor Dies or Not?
14386,That really sums up the alternate wacko faction's perspective on covid in a nutshell.
14387,For these ppl public health doesn't exist.
14388,Everything in life should be a competition with winners and losers.
14389,It's Social Darwinism taken to its final conclusion.
14390,I know right?
14391,"That would also include the increase of deaths from suicides and opioid caused deaths that increased during and from the Pandemic, skewing the numbers."
14392,"The numbers will always be skewed, this doesn‚Äôt discount the people who lost their lives or the fact the worldwide death toll is under 3% of those known to be infected."
14393,Do I think the preventative measures we have taken during COVID helped reduce that number?
14394,Absolutely.
14395,"I also think we did more harm to our populations then good in the economical sections with stay at home orders, closures and mask mandates."
14396,I feel them to be to strict and heavy handed.
14397,I do wonder if those preventive measures are ‚ÄúHindsight is 20/20 (haha a pun)‚Äù or if it truly was good ‚ÄúForesight‚Äù in those measures and that is why the fatality rate is under 3%.
14398,I wonder this when [out of 5million severe cases of influenza the casualty rate is 10% worldwide.
14399,"](https://www.medscape.com/answers/219557-3459/what-is-the-global-incidence-of-influenza) I find it hard to support those stricter methods, since we haven‚Äôt made ‚Äúflu season‚Äù mask mandated or flu shots mandatory prior to COVID with a significantly higher fatality rate."
14400,"Even this article suggests those numbers are skewed, since it states the US doesn‚Äôt report or count deaths from influenza."
14401,"COVID is of course a different beast, and I do believe we should adopt wearing a mask if you are sick or not feeling well like other countries outside of the US have been doing for years."
14402,"I also support better time off and sick time practices for business, both for employe and employers that would help reduce the number of many viruses and there cause and effects."
14403,"I do not support mask mandates, or mandatory vaccinations, even if I support vaccines but again that is a separate beast I won‚Äôt get into."
14404,"My stance is hard enough for me to define to myself, let alone openly discuss at this moment."
14405,"It isn‚Äôt fun to put numbers and percentages to human lives but from a neutral view with logic and reason it can be done, the problem is people viewing such numbers and percentages can‚Äôt always take away their emotions behind it and thus have irrational and damaging reactions to these kind of conversations and thought sharing."
14406,"There are far to many negative emotional reactions nowadays then attempts at solutions, discussion or information sharing."
14407,"The common theme is to verbally attack another human, berate and belittle, be derisive and even make it common place to suggest physical punishment for not thinking the same and conforming."
14408,Those are Dark Age ideals.
14409,"It shouldn‚Äôt be common to do those things to strangers, neighbors and our families."
14410,"Asking someone why they think that, what is their experiences and or their reasoning behind their opinion and moral compass is what should be asked."
14411,"Them vs us does not create unity or a peaceful society, it creates a childish one run with the mindset a teenager has towards their parents."
14412,"Oh yeah, like the fucking idiots who don't know how cause of death is reported, so they cut it both ways depending on the point they're trying to make."
14413,"On the one hand, COVID numbers are being ""inflated"" because almost all the reported COVID deaths include co-morbidities like pneumonia, heart attack, or respiratory failure."
14414,As if _symptoms of COVID_ are somehow unrelated to the disease and suspicious to find in a COVID patient.
14415,"On the other hand, they'll say _any_ medical event that happens around the time of the vaccine counts as a vaccine side effect, even if it's someone crashing a fucking car into a tree whole driving drunk."
14416,If they got the vaccine a couple days ago it'll be listed.
14417,But that doesn't mean the doctor thinks it _caused_ the accident.
14418,I really don‚Äôt get how you get downvoted by not knowing something and asking questions about it.
14419,Fucking Reddit.
14420,You helped a bit in my understanding of it.
14421,So so far it‚Äôs unclear how long we will need to get shots.
14422,"""You can't fix stupid"" also fits."
14423,[removed]
14424,Still unclear.
14425,"So far immunity has held up very well and mutations have not significantly ""pieced"" that protection."
14426,"On the plus side, these vaccines are very effective so even if there is some mutations that doesn't mean we would need a new shot every year."
14427,Also even though there is a lot of talk about covid mutating it is till seen as mutating less than the flu viruses so there is a good chance shots would happen less frequently than the flu shot.
14428,But really the only way to know for sure is to wait and see.
14429,"Even the 3rd shot is not a done deal yet, though that is very possible."
14430,"If something they got from the political identity is wrong, then that means they're wrong."
14431,And they refuse to accept that they could be wrong.
14432,So everything else must be wrong.
14433,[removed]
14434,"10% isn't that low, depending on how much lower than 10% the outdoor spread is it still seems like it's a good idea to wear a mask outdoors when you can't maintain distancing, especially in big crowds (concerts, etc)."
14435,&gt;But they also found frustratingly few papers that detailed the settings or clearly compared indoor and outdoor situations.
14436,"So I don't think it's really fair to say ""study after study"" has already shown this."
14437,'past week'... pass week makes zero sense.
14438,"Races were either entirely behind closed doors, or to a reduced domestic crowd."
14439,Largely the former.
14440,"For the teams themselves, they all had to bubble, and were tested very regularly."
14441,"F1 did an incredible job and managed to get a significantly lower prevalence than the UK, where the majority of staff are based."
14442,"Barring the initial fiasco in Australia back in March, I really don't see how their system could be criticised."
14443,"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/04/13/covid-outside-safety/

&gt;In a systematic review of published studies on transmission of the novel coronavirus and other respiratory viruses, Razani and colleagues found that less than 10 percent of cases described were spread outdoors."
14444,But they also found frustratingly few papers that detailed the settings or clearly compared indoor and outdoor situations.
14445,"&gt;‚ÄúOur takeaway from this is that it‚Äôs not impossible to get an infection outdoors, even though from what is published, clearly the proportion of when that happens is much lower,‚Äù Razani said."
14446,"She added: ‚ÄúIf you are going to a beach ‚Äî which is a beautiful thing ‚Äî you should avoid times when it‚Äôs crowded, and have your mask, and have a Plan B.‚Äù

The study (which reviews other studies on the matter, which have the 1% - 5+%)

&gt;Five identified studies found a low proportion of reported global SARS-CoV-2 infections occurred outdoors (&lt;10%) and the odds of indoor transmission was very high compared to outdoors (18.7 times; 95% confidence interval, 6.0‚Äì57.9)."

14553,And non-vaccinated have the same free pass the rest of us do.
14554,They can choose not to take the shot and accept the risks that go along with that.
14555,I will go to any concert right now if it doesn‚Äôt require masks.
14556,I‚Äôd be miserable and not enjoy it otherwise
14557,Not a doctor but my understanding is that if everyone is vaccinated the risk is extremely low.
14558,It's only when vaccinated people are around unvaccinated people that could be carriers that the risk is a little higher (but still really low) for you.
14559,Check with your local health department and see what they say.
14560,Thank the media for that
14561,CNN has already admitted that the death count was just a political ploy to help Biden.
14562,Media sensationalism.
14563,Fear sells.
14564,"Based on uptake, though, most people are seeing through it."
14565,There is still hope for humanity.
14566,"Not everyone does their ""research"" on Facebook."
14567,"I'd love to visit a friend in Europe, but I'd honestly feel like a bit of an asshole visiting another country for fun where there are people who want the vaccine but still can't get it."
14568,I guess I'll see how things are looking for Europe come June or July.
14569,I wonder if every crew member and AP employees around the world have even been vaccinated?
14570,"Is it really surprising that the age groups whose livelihood was put on the back burner for the last year+, have little motivation to go get vaccinated?"
14571,"As you pointed out, the messaging is terrible, get a shot, stay the status quo!"
14572,Now return to your job like the good little front line workers you are!
14573,"Thanks for your sacrifice and hard work btw...

Also, scheduling for this is a pain in the ass for them/us."

14582,"20,000THB is a lot of money in thailand."
14583,$640 is nearly cost of living for a month.
14584,KN95 with head straps and if needed masktite across the nose.
14585,If your glasses are are really fogging up that's an indicator that your mask isn't sealing very well.
14586,Send them to india
14587,&gt;Otherwise AZ could just as well take the money and run.
14588,Which is basically what they did...
14589,How so?
14590,I never said we shouldn't do it.
14591,Just pointing out that of all the vaccines we have we decide the share only that one.
14592,India needs all the help we can provide.
14593,"The places I'd likely visit probably rely very heavily on tourism to support the local economy, so that just feels like even more of a reason to start letting people in."
14594,"Yes, fingers crossed!"
14595,!
14596,"Well, it was the guideline at the time, so I don't get why all the hate here"
14597,Where a whole flight of people submitted fake COVID tests?
14598,Maybe the occasional person here and there but clearly this faking of tests is rampant in India.

14600,If this vaccine had been rolled out more efficiently by the Trump administration my aunt may still be alive today.
14601,She got sick a week before she was supposed to get the vaccine for her age bracket in early February.
14602,Fuck anyone who says we shouldn't push vaccines more.
14603,It could have saved her life and countless others.
14604,"I hate the term ""new normal."""
14605,"Seriously the whole idea is to get back to normal, not some weird approximation, just normal."
14606,"I'm sure there were plenty of categories where deaths dropped due to lockdowns, but I believe somewhat surprisingly car accident deaths actually remained the same."
14607,"The theory was with less cars on the roads, people were free to drive faster and therefore accidents were more lethal."
14608,Lol sure.
14609,Onus is on the individual to not get sick and not the person having the disease to wear a mask.
14610,"But sure you ""masked up""."
14611,It's amazing how people like you can say that so ironically.
14612,And there are no other respiratory diseases anymore and maskers wearing should now be considered offensive again and not proper safety measures.
14613,If you did mask up then why are you against wearing a mask when sick?
14614,It won't kill you and it will save others from getting a disease.
14615,I had a very light body ache (possibly placebo?)
14616,but I was surprised how normal I felt.
14617,Certain cities also require it in crowded outdoor spaces when you can socially distance.
14618,The doses probably won‚Äôt be going to the 3rd world.

14627,"The thing is, why does it matter if a few people had COVID?"
14628,"All along we‚Äôve been hearing that airplanes are safe, that COVID won‚Äôt spread easily because air flow is always replenished from the outside."
14629,That if you wear a mask and the people around you wear a mask inside a plane then it‚Äôs very low likelihood of catching it.
14630,So how the fuck did all the passengers on a flight catch COVID when all of the above is supposed to be true?
14631,!
14632,&gt; I have a relative like this.
14633,That's a relative that I would cease having contact with.
14634,Life is too short to suffer fools.
14635,Bad comment considering the extreme need and with India burning right now
14636,Had a family member on FB say he knew someone that broke their neck and they chalked it up to a COVID-19 death.
14637,Dude has been so full of shit all his life that‚Äôs it bound to spew out from time to time.
14638,Thank you!!!!
14639,There's a high chance that the US wouldn't need this vaccine so it would make sense to give the stockpiled doses to the rest of the world

14650,you remember over a year ago (I think in Jan or early Feb) when Ford was on the television telling us all is well?
14651,How Ontario has plenty of respirators and hospital resources?
14652,Even I had doubts then.
14653,My friends took several months before they had to admit Ford has no idea what he is doing.

14664,They need logistical support.
14665,"This whole covid thing has really highlighted how many people don't understand science, don't give a shit about anybody other than themselves, or both."
14666,"For young children, covid and influenza have approximately similar fatality rates, as well as similar rates of serious illness and lasting symptoms."
14667,"If you are extremely concerned for your child about one of these, but not at all concerned about the other, then your risk analysis is extremely skewed."
14668,"My own background is in bioinformatics, for what it's worth."
14669,Do you not realize that article is not referring to the blood clot related pause?
14670,&gt;If the media was interested in doing good they'd emphasize the intense scrutiny these vaccines go through even after they are released and would have been doing so for months.

14677,Its not all about the money.
14678,"Similarly, it also doesn't mean that we can't feel bad that he has deal with Ron Johnson-types."
14679,We want an expert like him in there; showing that there are people who are in solidarity with him is a way to help keep him there.
14680,"At that point, it's on them if they want to risk getting sick."
14681,I'll have my peace of mind knowing that I most likely won't.
14682," I'm aware vaccines don't protect 100%, so until numbers in my community fall and continue to stay down, being around strangers that could be unvaccinated, asymptomatic and still capable of transmitting covid to me isn't worth the risk especially when it's a super easy risk to avoid."
14683,"Well, it should have no impact on their production capacities..."
14684,I don't think that the AZ lawyers are the ones that are manufacturing the vaccine.
14685,Who asked you?
14686,"Christ, I had my kid at the beach the just other day for a meet up with some of her friends and had to deal with somebody like this trying to tell me how to go about my day."
14687,"Yeah, I know odds of transmission are low."
14688,"Point of fact, I'm vaccinated."
14689,"But I always wear my mask in that situation because it makes it way, way easier to get her to do so and, being a kid, she isn't vaccinated and tends to get right up into people's faces."

14702,I had that same issue.
14703,It took a little over a week to fully resolve.
14704,I just feel like people are capable of understanding nuance.
14705,"It seems perfectly logical that the vaccine mostly protects you but not completely, and you are surrounded by people infected with covid, you still have some risk."
14706,It also seems logical to say that if everyone around you is also vaccinated then odds are very few people still get it and you‚Äôre safer.
14707,"Being the only one in the room who‚Äôs vaccinated is not the same as mostly being around other vaccinated people, and it‚Äôs ok for our guidance to reflect that."
14708,Some states are starting to tie easing off restrictions to specific percentages of the population being vaccinated.
14709,"I like that approach because it reflects the reality that your risk depends on those around you, plus it‚Äôs a carrot to get people to get the shot."
14710,Nah just making a joke about only sharing our least preferred option.
14711,Seems to have upset people though.
14712,So would I in your shoes.
14713,"Just saying, why have we not released Pfizer and Moderna to the world?"

14720,I'd worry more about to dying from other diseases at that point.
14721,"This is what I think is turning some people off, is the fear of side effects, me and my wife both got morderna, she had side effects within 2 hours, she was wiped out for 2 days, I was fine I had local pain where I got the shot, on the 2nd dose my wife again was out for a day, I had no side effects at all other than the local pain in arm."
14722,"1-5% of cases being due to outdoor transmission translates to roughly 6,000-30,000 deaths."
14723,Most of which were preventable.
14724,Low outdoor transmission doesn't mean precautions like masks in area you can't be well distanced were the wrong decision.
14725,They used to talk about it a lot.
14726,My guess is that it was probably just another racist dog whistle though.
14727,This dude is right!
14728,Standardized documents certified by government and or private entities have never worked for anything in the past!

14756,Honesty 6 years later not much has changed.
14757,I feel as safe as before.
14758,I've met many people from different cultures and I am fine with the increased immigration during that time.
14759,But they don't have the same rights already and will have less with a passport to enjoy stuff.
14760,The passport sets up a have and a have not population.
14761,Those that have not are often minorities.
14762,Just like voter ID in the USA.
14763,This means some races will benefit because of policies like this.
14764,In the end people will calm it racism.
14765,Oh no no no Doc......this can't be.
14766,A virus has a low transmission rate when outside?
14767,That is hard to believe.
14768,I have two very large weddings coming up in the next two months.
14769,One had 350 people invited and the other one likely has at least 200+ people.
14770,My SO and I are fully vaccinated.
14771,"However, we chose not to go since we're not comfortable being in such a large crowd."

14773,"However, we just don't feel that same level of comfort."
14774,"Also, I'm pregnant."
14775,"So, there's that addition hesitancy on top of it."
14776,I'm hoping after I deliver I'll feel more comfortable in large crowds.
14777,"But for now, I'm also in the waiting pool."
14778,There are no air locks.
14779,But could you pressurize a grounded jet and raise oxygen by pressure?
14780,Also completely serious.
14781,viagra does something with oxygen carrying potential.
14782,"He's taking the piss...no wait, he's giving the piss."
14783,This is research is on really dodgy ground ethically speaking - we cannot know for sure that re-infection is *not* more severe (but I guess we are going to find out!

14785,"Also, what exactly is the benefit?"

14800,I am not talking about Americans.
14801,I just got my second shot and cannot wait to get back to the gym - I tried going a few times back in August and September but it was too sketchy.
14802,"I was only using weights so my mask never came off but I was surrounded by young people in groups, older people not wiping down machines, etc."

14826,"1 week for Pfizer, 2 for Moderna."
14827,3 for J&amp;J.
14828,Well there's over a billion people and the vaccine isn't a cure or treatment if you have coronavirus in any case.
14829,lol Germany could never.
14830,They just added even more restrictions which will probably just keep being extended for the next six months because the government forgot how to do literally anything else.
14831,No word on when the other priority groups will open up; just promises of July from people who have done everything wrong up to this point and no actual information on how they're going to do this or under what circumstances the restrictions can be lifted.
14832,It‚Äôs really much too early to say that.
14833,A lot of us are still on waiting lists... vaccines are still in short supply in many areas.
14834,It certainly wont be a regular occurance for me.
14835,I can deal with 2 or three shots(like they say now) if i‚Äôm told to get a fourth... absolutely not.

14851,So do you troll for enjoyment or employment?
14852,Asking for a friend.
14853,"Do you think changing the messaging at that point from you need to mask up even if vaccinated to vaccines mean you don't need to wear a mask won't just further fuel the ""experts either don't know, or knowingly lie to manipulate you"" sentiment?"
14854,"You act like variants don‚Äôt exist, like they aren‚Äôt playing a big role in other countries for why they‚Äôre being hit so hard, something our vaccines still do a dam good job against but something it wasn‚Äôt specifically designed to protect against."
14855,"If I know I‚Äôm around other vaccinated people then sure I don‚Äôt mind wearing a mask, but just because I‚Äôm vaccinated doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm now suddenly cool being 2 feet away from maskless #personalfreedom Phil and Linda while they talk and laugh away."

14861,E... First thing I did was hit up spring break in miami.
14862,Shit was lit
14863,I also have a high risk 4-year-old.
14864,I'm so tired of seeing this like death is the only bad outcome from getting covid.
14865,I couldn't live with myself if they caught it and ended up with long-term consequences.
14866,It's never been death I've been worrying about yet that's consistently all anyone talks about.
14867,"If you get into a car accident and lose a leg, is that still not a big deal because at least you lived?"
14868,We still don't know enough about the long term effects of even asymptomatic cases.
14869,Throwing this stat at someone concerned about the health of their kid feels pretty condescending; like you're assuming they haven't already familiarized themselves with it.
14870,You have no idea what that kid's asthma was like.
14871,Just like you have no idea the impact covid could have on a high risk kid.
14872,"Listening to your kid cough all night, every night, for long periods of time is heart wrenching."
14873,Trying everything their doctor recommends and more just to have it not make a difference is disheartening.
14874,"I don't blame them in the slightest for not wanting to chance their kid going through that again, but worse."
14875,"Shit's a bit more complicated than, ""but did they die?"""
14876,"Translation with Deepl:

&gt;All adults can now be vaccinated in the canton of Vaud."
14877,"The canton is opening the appointment for vaccination to the entire population aged 18 and over, it said in a statement on Monday."
14878,"""As of Monday, April 26 at 12:30 p.m., all persons born before 2003 and living in the canton of Vaud can make an appointment, preferably via the website [www.coronavax.ch](https://www.coronavax.ch), or by calling 058 715 11 00 if registration via the Internet is not possible,"" the text states."
14879,"&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;""With the increased deliveries of Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, the reinforcement of the cantonal system and the progress of vaccination in the previous groups, the conditions are in place to offer the possibility of being vaccinated to the entire population over 18 years of age who wish to be vaccinated,"" it explains."
14880,"To date, more than 83% of the chronically ill are vaccinated, two-thirds of those over 75 and more than half of those aged 65-74, the canton said."
14881,"When the program was first opened to 50-64 year olds, the response was enthusiastic and about half of this category has already made an appointment, he says."
14882,"&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The over-18s can therefore be vaccinated in turn, in order to offer prospects, the statement said."
14883,"The Federal Council's three-phase plan currently under consultation mentions vaccination coverage as one of the criteria for relaxing measures so that social, cultural and sporting life can gradually resume, it recalls."
14884,"&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Montreux not included this Monday  
&gt;  
&gt;If the appointment process could be extended, it is also thanks to the inauguration this Monday of the new mass vaccination center in Montreux."
14885,"Open from Monday to Saturday, from 8am to 10pm, and on Sunday from 9am to 4pm, it operates with a capacity of 4000 injections per week for the first 4 weeks, then about 8000."
14886,"It should also be noted that it is now possible to be vaccinated since Monday at the Unisant√© center in Lausanne, as well as in the Bois-Cerf and Genolier private clinics."
14887,"&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The Vaud system now includes 14 vaccination centers and sites throughout the canton, namely the HIB in Payerne, the EHNV in Yverdon, the HRC in Rennaz, La Ligni√®re in Gland, the EHC in Morges, the GHOL in Nyon, the Genolier clinic, the CHUV in Lausanne, Beaulieu, Unisant√© and the Bois-Cerf clinic in Lausanne, the 2M2C center in Montreux, as well as the P√¥le Sant√© du Balcon du Jura and the Vall√©e de Joux."
14888,Not to mention a vast network of doctors and pharmacies throughout the canton.

14892,I'm the same way.
14893,Almost 3 weeks since my second dose and I still wear a mask.
14894,"But, I am a cancer patient and I can't help but feel like a Covid diagnosis would really set me back so, for the time being, I will wear a mask and maintain social distancing."
14895,"However, this is for my sake, not because I am worried about giving someone else Covid."
14896,"Two of the biggest things working against us right now are the fact that we've both failed to provide a proper science education to mass proportions of our population as well as not teaching people the necessary skills to navigate the ""misinformation era."""

14916,captain obvious juvenile journalism..............
14917,Rules for ye and not for me
14918,The missing piece of any mask regulation debate is how Americans wear masks.
14919,In nyc on a typical subway trip I consistently see about 20 percent of people actually wearing a mask correctly.
14920,"Noses out in some, but the biggest issue is non bent nose wire side flaps wide open blue masks."
14921,I flew to Atlanta recently and well over half the plane were in gaiters or improper fit blue masks.
14922,"Most people can‚Äôt stop touching them and pulling down like a nervous tick

The woman next to had a face shield and two n95 on."
14923,Great right?
14924,Of course she took it all off to eat some peanuts from the stewardess that of course couldn‚Äôt be bothered to bend the nose wire on her mask.
14925,I sold a crib on fb marketplace yesterday.
14926,Guy comes in lobby and cannot stop touching his mask for 2 mins he looked at the crib.
14927,On off on off.
14928,Nose wire unbent.
14929,We can‚Äôt even wear masks correctly indoor or out.
14930,Certainly even in nyc is less than half of people wearing something correctly or actually effective.
14931,Racism?
14932,"Explain to me how this *unvaccinatus sapiens* looks like, I haven't seen one."
14933,"I hope that if you don't like filters so that non-immunized people serve as hosts for a virus that caused a pandemic, I'm sure you'd absolutely love a ""no filters"" policy so that it allows for taking immigrants in the thousands from Syria, Irak and Afghanistan without any background check and let them free roam your country, right?"
14934,I'm sure you'll adore that.
14935,It just shows that your government is scum.
14936,Look at the things that modi fight for.
14937,People are dying and you are still defending that scum.
14938,"Modi-cum, get it?"
14939,Wipe it off.
14940,I'm from NZ mate shits cool down here.
14941,Because one is almost certainly caused by the vaccine while the other could very well be just a coincidence.
14942,And the data so far supports that.
14943,&gt;Twelve new cases of Covid-19 in the community were confirmed in Fiji tonight.
14944,&gt;This is the country's biggest number of cases in a single day since the virus returned to the community following breaches at a managed isolation quarantine (MIQ) facility in Nadi last week.
14945,"&gt;Estimated rate 1 in 20,000

The article says that that rate of 1 in 20,000 applies to the population aged 16-30."
14946,"Presumably that's close to 1 in 10,000 for men aged 16-30, since most of the cases have been in men."
14947,"By comparison, the background rate of viral myocarditis is [usually estimated at](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459259/#_article-25470_s4_:~:text=Incidence%20is%20usually%20estimated%20between%2010%20to%2020%20cases%20per%20100%2C000%20persons) 10 to 20 cases per 100,000 people per year."
14948,"That's 1 in 5,000 to 1 in 10,000."
14949,"However, Israelis haven't been vaccinated for a whole year; on average they were vaccinated about 3 months ago."
14950,"So in that period of 3 months we'd expect to see maybe 1 in 20,000 to 1 in 40,000 cases of myocarditis."
14951,"On these (admittedly crude) numbers it looks like there's nothing to panic about yet, but it's worth investigating."
14952,The incidence of myocarditis isn't necessarily higher than you'd expect.
14953,"But as we've seen with the AZ clotting issue, once researchers suspect a specific vaccine complication and start re-examining the records, they may find other cases which were missed at first."
14954,"(That's perfectly natural, because finding patterns in big datasets is hard, but it's even harder when you don't even know if there's a pattern in there.)"
14955,So this needs to be followed up.
14956,They aren‚Äôt transmitting it at any meaningful level while mask mandates are in place.
14957,I suspect not now that vaccination is happening.
14958,Depends how effective the vaccination programme is given the various strains and potentially short-lived protection.
14959,"But, it's specious to compare a 3rd world country of over a billion people to 300 million people - even disregarding relative economies."
14960,There never was an outside risk unless you were slammed up against another person.
14961,Is 9 days post second shot an acceptable amount of time to meet indoors with people again?
14962,"Early in the pandemic when there was a crisis level
shortage of PPE in hospitals he recommended against the public buying them to wear in public."
14963,At the time people were hoarding them like toilet paper.
14964,That was a myopic view of the issue intended to keep hospitals functioning.
14965,By the beginning of April  they‚Äôd changed to advocating cloth masks.
14966,It was an unwise call in a supply crunch.
14967,He wasn‚Äôt perfect on the issue clearly.
14968,But he‚Äôs promoted mask use when doing so risked his job for months and has been consistent clear through to today.
14969,Risk outside is low even is you're not vaccinated.
14970,This isn't new information.
14971,"&gt; I dont think people realized how close we were to being in the same position as India here in the US

We hoped and prayed but you pulled out of it."
14972,Definitely more so that we still need to be careful as they aren‚Äôt vaccinated nor are other kids their age yet
14973, The Indian government is too incompetent.
14974,They still require PCR from vaccinated people?
14975,"When the ""solution"" is worse than the problem."
14976,It's the least they could do after all the shit that the colonials did to India back in the day.
14977,"I consider this atonement, not nearly enough to make right what was done but maybe a little bit."
14978,Latest data I saw from the EU was from a few days ago which I think was 145 million kept and 155 million exported.
14979,Unsure if the exports also included COVAX.
14980,"Yep, I needed to hear this."
14981,Thank you!
14982,Upvote from OP :)
14983,"&gt;However, the messaging coming from Fauci and public health authorities is still saying that vaccinated people spread the virus and are waiting for ‚Äúmore information‚Äù to confirm that vaccinated people don‚Äôt spread covid as much."
14984,So you are saying it bothers you they take precautionary measures until it's confirmed a vaccinated person barely sheds virus IF asymptomatic?
14985,Because I think I don't have to explain that a symptomatic one of course sheds virus.
14986,Do you realise that transmission statistics will not exists until a substantial amount of communities have been vaccinated?
14987,May I ask exactly what is your logic or point there?
14988,Because I'm simply missing why that message bothers you.
14989,"I hope you have data to back it up, because the lack of data is the very reason why we play it safe."
14990,It would be nice not to have to wear a mask attending outdoor MLB baseball games this summer.
14991,"Because they don‚Äôt care that science takes time to replicate studies, or that data from a new disease can change

They just want to be mad."
14992,It‚Äôs so fucking bizarre
14993,"‚ÄúBut when you look around at the common sense situation, the risk is really low, especially if you‚Äôre vaccinated,"" he said."
14994,[removed]
14995,"‚ÄúHe acknowledged it was a mistake‚Äù

That‚Äôs all I‚Äôm pointing out."
14996,Idk why that‚Äôs so frowned upon to show even Fauci wasn‚Äôt perfect on this whole thing.
14997,"Thank you very much, that was all very interesting, I appreciate your time."
14998,[removed]
14999,He said there is ‚Äúno reason to be walking around in a mask.‚Äù And that there are unintended consequences of using masks.
15000,Not that if you already got a mask wear it.
15001,If you read the whole quote and similar quotes from the Surgeon General at the time they clearly didn‚Äôt understand the importance of masks early on.
15002,And it‚Äôs fine!
15003,It was a novel virus we didn‚Äôt fully understand at the time.
15004,But why lie about the meaning of his initial quote?
15005,&gt; when will it stop?
15006,When everyone else who wants to get vaccinated can?
15007,"I'm glad you were able to get vaccinated, others haven't been so lucky."
15008,It's not too much to ask to wear another piece of clothing so you minimize the transmission for a while longer.
15009,Even if it was pointless it's also completely harmless outside of it being a minor inconvenience.
15010,Yet even before covid of you went to Asia during even flu season you‚Äôd see masks all the time.
15011,"It‚Äôs exactly that ‚Äúwhat you were told to do‚Äù

 If told and there‚Äôs merit it‚Äôs valid."
15012,If not told it doesn‚Äôt mean that there isn‚Äôt merit and not valid.
15013,When y9u don't have the highest case numbers?
15014,That's means to have the tightest restrictions.
15015,It's bad so you have to prevent it.
15016,Wow.
15017,Having a employee or even domestic culture which acknowledges be open about mistake over lying about them esp when it comes to matters of healthcare really rings important in times like these.
15018,It really depends on the country.
15019,France has a very popular antivaxx movement (unfortunately) and I wouldn't be surprised if they vaccinate less per capita than the US.
15020,The UK is pretty much the opposite of that.

15033,I‚Äôm waiting for my kids to be vaccinated and for data on the risk of asymptomatic or mild post vaccine Covid turning into long Covid.
15034,This is right on the money.
15035,We‚Äôre getting down to people who are on the fence about the vaccine and there‚Äôs no way they‚Äôre going to get it if you tell them they‚Äôre still going to have to wear masks and social distance afterwards.

15040,I know 2 prison guards.
15041,Both are very antivaxx.
15042,One of the reasons that you may have higher cases despite higher restrictions is if you live in a stare with higher population density.
15043,This has been a large contributing factor to the higher cases.
15044,It‚Äôs why some states took a while to see a spike at the beginning.
15045,"It‚Äôs possible you live in a less populated area and still have to follow guidelines for the more densely populated areas
Some governors have opted to not regionalize their restrictions."

15180,I think it depends on the level of risk you are willing to take.
15181,After 2 weeks the first shot gives you about 80% protection and two weeks after the second shot it tends to 95%.

15186,"With vaccinations in full swing and entire communities getting vaccinated, I would agree masks are unnecessary even indoors!"
15187,The risk is lower now!
15188,Not a year back when everyone had covid and it wasn't safe in large crowded areas.
15189,This is due to vaccination efforts.

15420,They are more or less the same virus it just seems that covid has a longer incubation period and people can transmit it while pre-symptomatic to more of a degree.
15421,These are the reasons it caused a pandemic this time around.
15422,"It would be *relatively* safe for you to see people who are fully vaccinated now, particularly given that you are fully vaccinated."
15423,"The CDC explicitly says a fully vaccinated household can visit with an unvaccinated household indoors, without masks."
15424,"Studies haven't said *for sure* if vaccination completely prevents transmission, but given they are significantly effective against *any* type of infection (symptomatic and asymptomatic) it would stand to reason they are significantly effective at reducing or eliminating transmission as well."
15425,"Inactivated virus vaccines, no matter how exhaustively they are tested, inherently carry the risk that the inactivation process will be incorrectly or incompletely done in a batch of vaccine and end up infecting people with the disease you're trying to prevent, as happened with a polio vaccine."
15426,"Especially when you're trying to persuade a skeptical populace, it's very nice to be able to say ""the vaccine cannot give you the disease, it's physically impossible"" instead of ""it's possible you could get the disease, but it's extremely unlikely and never happened in testing""."
15427,This whole covid thing has done nothing but give insufferable people like you a voice.
15428,What's your solution?

15430,"&gt;It's obvious that the J&amp;J ... shots are going to be collecting dust in warehouses

J&amp;J is an important part of the vaccination effort."
15431,"Because it's one-shot and easier to distribute, there are many populations (people living in remote areas, the homeless, the bedridden, folks who are scared of needles, people who can't be bothered to make two appointments, etc) for whom a J&amp;J shot is much easier to administer than the mRNA vaccines."
15432,Totally down to start sharing vaccines as soon as we lift all mandates and restrictions.
15433,America.
15434,Exactly.
15435,No one is going to decide to vaccinate if they're on the fence now ‚Äì‚Äì they're just going to lie about it unless you give people some way to verify vaccine status.
15436,"Unless you either accept vaccine verification methods or more people get the shots, the mask mandates can't end until everyone (including kids) can get the shot."
15437,"&gt; May, June and July the EU will more per capita than the US and UK ever have received

True, but that's ultimately simply too late."
15438,"The UK with its coverage now has dropped into very low deaths, and still dropping, the US is only weeks behind, with numbers already below some EU states."
15439,"The key to vaccinations was getting the most vulnerable covered early, not having an excess 6 months later."
15440,"I mean, you‚Äôve got relatives who are basically leaning on the outdated miasma theory of illness rather than face reality."
15441,How frustrating.
15442,"In my country there's a death benefit from the government if you pass due to covid, worth enough to pay for the funeral and/or more, generally we have a fairly low death rate already so doctors in my area are offering to write covid as the cause of death even if there was no covid."
15443,"Can't say that's what's going on over there in the US, in my country doctors are mostly humanitarian, they have absolutely no qualms about lying on a form to get a family in need money or save them money."
15444,"&gt;""He died because of blood clots but because he had covid that's what they said he died of""

Gee, seems like a lot of people with COVID also happen to die."
15445,"Just a coincidence, I'm sure."
15446,People might turn it down but 10 more people want it.
15447,My husband got the AZ last week.
15448,He wouldn't have received a vaccine for another 6 weeks or more.
15449,Any vaccine is better than no vaccine.
15450,Y2K enters the room.
15451,Even the quote your posted contradicts you.
15452,"Oh, I did."
15453,"It was miserable at points but as you say, it is what it is."
15454,Exactly.
15455,"Literally the second sentence:

&gt; Only 53% of adults under 35 said they have gotten ‚Äì or plan to get ‚Äì vaccinated, lower than any other age group"
15456,"Not sure, since the mRNA vaccines are incredibly safe and effective."
15457,Do you have an agenda that you aren't mentioning?
15458,what the hell did they think was going to happen with the news blowing up about 8 people of the millions that had issues?
15459,"Made up or not, the survival rate is still over 99.99% of our population."
15460,Does that really warrant a mass vaccination program??
15461,Or should we be triaging our population?
15462,Surface transmission has also been shown to be low.
15463,The medi-ite guys question is effectively a softball opinion piece.
15464,Video journalism is awful these days.
15465,"Regardless, Fauci is fine, and Johnson is foolish."
15466,I can respect that you came around on it.

15470,"Worse that that, they are absolutely useless to prevent the spread of Covid."
15471,At best they direct the wearers spew in a different direction.

15475,My favorite thing is when people tell me hospitals have incentive to report anything as COVID because they receive additional payments if it is a COVID case.
15476,I am an accountant.
15477,All I had been hearing is that doctor's pay were being furlough because of the strain that not having elective procedures were having on the hospital's cash flows.
15478,"If there is anything I have learned as an accountant, it is this one thing."
15479,You see money being shifted like that.
15480,"It's for a fucking real reason, and not because they are making more money."
15481,"It's because they have a different definition of ""proven"" than you do."
15482,"There aren't gold-standard, double blinded controlled studies showing it."
15483,"There's still a lot of good evidence, though."
15484,It's pure theatrics

15488,FL
15489,"&gt; They conducted this poll between Sunday and Wednesday of last week, before C.D.C."
15490,and F.D.A.
15491,lifted their recommended pause on the J.&amp;J. vaccine.
15492,I'd be very interested to hear how those numbers changed after the pause was lifted.
15493,The science says people who are unvaccinated can still spread and contract the virus.
15494,"It's clear from five minutes living in the world that a significant portion of the population will not grow up and take the vaccine, and will take their masks off and lie about it if you give the slightest inkling that vaccinated people can stop masking ‚Äì‚Äì unless, of course, you have some way to verify vaccine status."
15495,This is what you get when people won't vaccinate and also won't accept checks for vaccine status.
15496,Theres a lot of lazy people and a lot of people who just don't know.
15497,Saw a post of someone complaining their grandma couldn't get the vaccine and was upset they opened it up to younger people.
15498,I looked at the once site and there were still 500 appointments available (someone helped her sign up later on).
15499,My coworker was just like I was able to cheat the system and get the vaccine for free because I'm a vet.
15500,He didn't realize it was free for everyone.
15501,He drove 1.5 hours to get the vaccine when theres a clinic 5 minutes from our location.
15502,I don't believe the death count either.
15503,"I think it's much, much higher but too many people at the heights of government are covering each other's asses."
15504,Just taking the US for example.
15505,A lot of people have commented that mass shootings are starting again.
15506,"Except, they never stopped."
15507,"And in fact, gun violence was up substantially last year."
15508,Mainly in low income neighborhoods.
15509,The media just stopped covering it.
15510,"And as a result, people‚Äôs perspective changed entirely."
15511,It‚Äôs incredible how much control the media has over public psyche.
15512,Hmmm okay.
15513,"So what do you think will be different in 6 months than now, while you are vaccinated?"
15514,Hes not the trained and educated doctor you're questioning.
15515,You need to do the same level of research as an epidemiologist or virologist to say you know better

15518,There's better ventilation on the plane than in the airport.
15519,"There's plenty of room in the airport, so distancing costs nothing and hurts no one."
15520,"On the plane, it's impossible."
15521,"Even if there were several COVID cases on the plane, the entire plane is not going to get infected."
15522,Keeping people apart in the line could still save lives.
15523,Take your pick.
15524,abbott's ID NOW test likely won't meet canada's criteria for pcr testing.

15531,"I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre being so obtuse but I found a video for you of Fauci saying it himself:

https://youtu.be/0XHC5Kxxv_w

They literally told us not to wear a mask to protect the supply of masks for medical professionals."
15532,"This happened, they admit it, and for many people it‚Äôs a justifiable way to handle that situation."
15533,"Personally, I think Fauci and others saying that masks were ineffective was a step too far."
15534,"When you later go against your own narrative, it‚Äôs understandable why people would have less trust in you."
15535,"That happened though, you can debate other elements of covid all you want but this is literally just something that happened."
15536,"It seems silly, but you have to draw lines somewhere and less exposure is better than more exposure."
15537,The people you're standing next to in line won't be the people sitting next to you in the plane so this policy cuts close contacts almost in half.
15538,The filters on the planes are very good at reducing Covid spread.
15539,There aren't similar filters in most gate areas.
15540,"When private companies are setting rules to reduce exposure, they just have to draw lines."
15541,They won't always seem to make sense.
15542,But Covid isn't magic.
15543,Every person your closer to and every minute you're closer to them increases your risk a tiny bit.
15544,Reasonable policy makers understand that they can't be perfect at eliminating risk.
15545,But that even low cost interventions (physically distanced waiting in line) that don't seem consistent with what's allowed elsewhere (sitting next to people on the plane) are a net good in terms of reducing spread.
15546,"And we're a month away in the US from none of this being a thing anymore, so whatever."
15547,"It‚Äôs very difficult to change people‚Äôs mind, it was difficult for me."
15548,"I don‚Äôt expect you change your mind, this has been extensively studied."
15549,I have no agenda with you or anyone in specific.
15550,"But f you don‚Äôt want to look at these studies, that‚Äôs totally cool."
15551,Lol yeah I always laugh at that when I fly these days.
15552,"At my airport they randomly block off some seats in waiting areas (but not all consistently throughout the airport, it's just some seats here and there) and then you get on the plane and are literally rubbing shoulders with the person next to you."
15553,It's quite silly.
15554,Trump contract with vaccine makers forbids this.
15555,The US surplus vaccines will rot in warehouses due to this.
15556,"""The facts presented do not represent what I know to be the truth and therefore the facts can not be accurate."
15557,"The only matter left to uncover is *how* they faked it."""
15558,And that's it.
15559,Don't waste your time arguing with someone like this.
15560,The pause (though fully warranted) definitely damaged J and J in  America.
15561,I knew so many people ready to take that vaccine but now will opt for Pfizer or Moderna because of the pause.
15562,Unused J and J shots are gonna start piling up quick.

15567,I caught my neighbor getting her mail with a mask on.

15574,I should also stop commenting for my own sanity as a health professional but it's hard to sometimes!
15575,"You can get an agreement that logic matters... for example, Fauci said ""...that you agree is highly effective..."" using Johnson's words against him."
15576,"""Senator Johnson of WI confirms vaccine is highly effective"" is the win in this battle of intellects, where the distinguished senator from Wisconsin came unarmed."
15577,Almost isn‚Äôt good enough.
15578,"Flu camp (emphasis mine):

\&gt; When the trial starts, we only inoculate them with a low dose of the virus, established **after many years of experience**, to minimise risk and symptoms, before monitoring the disease cycle as they go from healthy to sick to healthy again in our bespoke medical research facility."

15782,It's also another point about why we shouldn't just lift speed limits willy-nilly.

15792,"There were 36,096 motor vehicle fatalities in 2019."
15793,We didn't suddenly kill over ten times that number in 2020.
15794,You can also tell them that auto fatalities are up substantially as well in 2020 in preliminary numbers.
15795,How does that happen in a year when we are counting auto fatalities as covid deaths?
15796,I had an argument with someone that essentially devolved into them claiming the whole thing was a conspiracy to try and destroy Donald Trump my response was asking if the entire rest of the world was in on it?
15797,Their response was...yes.
15798,The numbers are pretty comparable.
15799,The study approaches were broadly similar in approach and structure and even broadly timing (e.g.
15800,the headline efficacy numbers both represent PCR-confirmed symptomatic cases and not asymptomatic testing).
15801,"There are two things to compensate for: 

1) J&amp;J's overall numbers got hit by the SA variant that does have some muting effect on efficacy but even excluding SA entirely the efficacy is still far below the mRNA vaccines."
15802,"2) The J&amp;J vaccines do continue to increase antibody response up until about 6-8 weeks post vaccination, whereas the study efficacy window began sooner than this."
15803,"However, the difference is not *that* significant and unlikely to dramatically impact efficacy."
15804,"The mRNA vaccines had a longer ""window"" because they started 5 weeks (Pfizer) to 7 weeks (Moderna) after the first dose."
15805,There's really no reason to believe why JnJ - as a single shot vaccine - would be superior to a two shot mRNA vaccine.
15806,Both vaccines work in a similar fashion (trick your cell into producing a spike protein) - the only difference is that the viral vector approach is a bit more complicated because it relies on a virus to deliver the payload and transcription into mRNA rather than just dropping the mRNA directly into the cell.
15807,It seems like one shot of mRNA vaccine is roughly equal to one shot of the JnJ vaccine (plus or minus a bit).
15808,The second dose of the mRNA vaccine helps increase efficacy significantly above the first dose.
15809,"The two shot AZ is very similar to JnJ in terms of how it works and has closer efficacy to the mRNA vaccines, although it is inhibited a bit against some variants because it does not use a stabilized spike protein (whereas JnJ, Pfizer, and Moderna do) that seems to impact response to some variants."
15810,"That said, it is good to have a single shot option for the reasons stated above around access and convenience."
15811,So this doesn't mean that JnJ doesn't play a key role in the US's vaccination strategy.
15812,But I don't know why people are so quick to try to pretend like there is not an efficacy difference between JnJ and the two mRNA vaccines.
15813,"It's just not supported by theoretical supposition (one shot vs. two shot with same overall cause of action), clinical study data, and increasingly real world data."
15814,"Or, more morbidly, drowning in a pool."
15815,Ah yes the stubborn child.
15816,Won't listen to anything contrary.
15817,Despite all the evidence.
15818,I will still see people be admitted because they caught it in a gathering or a park.
15819,You won't.

And for people like you who are willing to endanger other for that you should indeed be locked up."
15822,And you being a petulant child doesn't change the truth or the risk.

15897,My aunt however refuses to believe he died of covid and says he just had breathing problems.
15898,Which is ironic because that's literally what covid does to you but her argument is well he was doing just fine for the first 2 weeks so why would he suddenly die of covid.
15899,Like she fails to understand covid doesn't kill you immediately.
15900,It's a fluid situation which is why no one will come out with a solid answer.

Recent studies have indicated that vaccine efficacy is pathogen dose dependent, particularly in the context of preventing transmission (i.e., transmission blocking: Gomes et al."
16076,2014; Langwig et al.

16078,"Therefore, typical single pathogen dose vaccine trials may not accurately predict vaccine efficacy in the field."

16095,Ah that makes more sense if they can‚Äôt commit to deals because they can‚Äôt promise a volume due to production problems or the UK export ban.
16096,That is a sensible thing to do in my opinion.
16097,"Nowhere did I read they won‚Äôt commit due to sympathy with AZ, which is how I read your prior post."
16098,"Imagine if say they promised 300 million doses over 6 months, we based our vaccine program on that promise, and then they deliver say only 60 million - that would‚Äôve been a disaster!"
16099,"Neither of your sources claims that due to some imaginary unfair treatment of AZ they are stalling on deals, so quit your bs."
16100,Are you sure it's not written into a database somewhere?
16101,They may still be writing it into some sort of a central database.
16102,Risk of transmission when vaccinated is low in general.

16114,"From the article:

Colorado has reached a critical pivot point in its vaccination efforts."
16115,Approximately 2.5 million people ‚Äî roughly 43% of the state‚Äôs total population and 53% of the population eligible to receive a shot ‚Äî have gotten at least a first dose of vaccine.
16116,"But the number of shots given per day appears to be falling, after hitting a high of 79,480 doses administered on April 9."
16117,"Colorado vaccine providers administered more than 411,000 doses during the week of April 4."
16118,"The following week, the number dropped to just under 399,000 doses."
16119,More recent data is not yet available because of reporting delays.
16120,"and

The first thing to understand about vaccine hesitancy, say those who have studied it closely, is that it‚Äôs not what you think it is."
16121,"While the people who get the most attention are those opposed to all vaccines based on arguments that often lack scientific merit, they make up a small portion of vaccine holdouts."
16122,"Instead, most people who are hesitant to receive a vaccine think of themselves as pro-vaccination, and their concerns are grounded in something rational, said Jennifer Reich, a sociologist at the University of Colorado Denver who has written extensively about vaccines."
16123,"‚ÄùI start with the premise that everyone is trying to do the best they can with what information they have and to make a decision that feels authentic to them and aligns with their beliefs and values,‚Äù Reich said."
16124,"People who don‚Äôt have paid sick leave, for instance, may worry about getting a vaccine with side effects that could cause them to miss work."
16125,People who don‚Äôt have a regular medical provider may be uncertain where they can go to get good information.
16126,People who have been discriminated against in the medical system may not trust that health professionals have their best interests at heart.
16127,I guess both sides of the argument can agree with that at least.
16128,I haven't heard that non medical masks aren't effective.
16129,"Well the only point i could make in argument is, that with the virus going wild and without proper measures, the chance of mutation rises dramatically."
16130,"And with some mutations we already saw that some vaccines arent as effective as they should be, so if we are really unlucky we could get a mutation thats just immune to the vaccines and we start at the beginning."
16131,"So sure as much as we should celebrate the vaccination process, we also should be really carefully going forward and ""celebrating"" too early."
16132,"Probably because the media, CDC, and politicians are fear mongering and not being truthful about the science behind vaccines."
16133,Firstly I am very sorry for your loss.
16134,What I don't get is people say this shit and then don't realise that WITHOUT Covid they would still be alive.
16135,"They will say shit like, well she had diabetes and that is what killed her!"
16136,"Even though she had been alive for 10 years with diabetes and would have lived many more years with it, if not for COVID!"

16138,I pointed out the other day in another reddit post about the vast increase in overall deaths in 2020 and some idiot tried blaming it on the lockdown and suicides.

16144,There's some level of protection starting 12 days after the first shot as that's when the trial started to show some divergence between test and control groups.
16145,"Efficacy for the entire time between dose 1 and dose 2 was measured at 52.4% (later studies have shown that by 14 days after the first shot it's around 80%), efficacy in the week after dose 2 was measured at 90.5% and 7+ days after dose 2 was measured at 94.8%."

16148,Why did he get this angry about low levels of Vitamin D in the country?
16149,I honestly have no idea why anyone would settle for a non mRNA vaccine when you could have 90-95% immunity as opposed to J&amp;J‚Äôs 66-70.
16150,Even just one shot of Pfizer or Moderna gives you a higher immunity of 80%.
16151,"Not to mention, it is incredibly easy and faster to design boosters with mRNA."
16152,The only thing I can think of is that people are less scared to get a traditional vaccine?
16153,But it‚Äôs not like those shots didn‚Äôt have their own problems and conflicts.
16154,Everyone should just go mRNA.
16155,Don't let perfect be the enemy of good.
16156,The vaccines work and the messaging needs to reflect that -- get vaccinated and your life returns to full normal.
16157,That's it.
16158,"Sure, eventually there will be boosters, but that doesn't matter right now."
16159,The goal is to convince people to get vaccainted.
16160,"It‚Äôs like nothing ever happened today, I‚Äôm 100%."
16161,"Those side effects slid right off, the plan worked."
16162,More than 93 million Americans are fully vaccinated against the coronavirus.
16163,"Despite so many invigorated immune systems, the populace still needs to keep wearing masks, public health specialists say.The country is not yet so protected it can forgo face coverings."
16164,Case counts have spiked in some hot spots.
16165,"Meanwhile, it‚Äôs clearer than ever that masks protect wearers as well as those nearby.‚ÄúMasks are one of the best interventions that we have to prevent viral transmission from one person to another,‚Äù said Lisa Maragakis, an infectious-disease epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.But the newly vaccinated would be forgiven for giving their masks a second look."
16166,"In the first wave of vaccinations, after the Food and Drug Administration authorized the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in December, even front line health-care workers had these kinds of questions.‚ÄúI was caught off-guard at the beginning,‚Äù Maragakis said."
16167,"‚ÄúMy own colleagues started saying, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm vaccinated, let‚Äôs roll back all of our policies.‚Äô And it‚Äôs been very difficult to hold the line and say, ‚ÄòWait, wait, wait, it‚Äôs not time yet.‚Äô ‚ÄùWhat are mask recommendations for people who are vaccinated?In March, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidelines for what fully vaccinated people can do."
16168,"Some restrictions were loosened: People who are fully immunized can socialize with each other, ignoring masks and physical distancing."
16169,"It‚Äôs also okay to relax those precautions when meeting with non-vaccinated, low-risk members of a single household.But, in public, everyone should continue to wear masks, the agency said.Those guidelines ‚Äúare absolutely appropriate for this moment in time,‚Äù said Megan Ranney, an emergency medicine physician and professor at Brown University."
16170,"‚ÄúThere just aren‚Äôt enough of us who have immunity yet for it to be safe to take those masks off in public.‚ÄùThe country will get there, she said."
16171,There‚Äôs no precise percentage at which the nation suddenly becomes virus-proof; achieving herd immunity is not like toggling on a switch.
16172,"But Ranney suggested that, as the country reaches 70 to 80 percent of adults vaccinated, ‚Äúthen we‚Äôre going to be able to operate in public more like we currently do in private.‚ÄùThere are a few reasons the CDC‚Äôs current advice depends on the setting."
16173,"The coronavirus vaccines authorized by the FDA protect people from severe disease and death, although in extremely rare cases people who are vaccinated can still test positive.‚ÄúThis is not to undermine or discredit the vaccine in any way ‚Äî because we know they‚Äôre highly efficacious at preventing severe disease ‚Äî but they‚Äôre not 100 percent,‚Äù Maragakis said.Likewise, there are encouraging signs that vaccines reduce transmission, but it is not yet definitive that they halt spread completely."
16174,"‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre vaccinated, then you have that protection for your own health,‚Äù Maragakis said."
16175,‚ÄúThere is still that chance that you could be a vector and put other unvaccinated individuals at risk.‚ÄùMasks complement vaccines.
16176,There are persuasive observations that facecoverings are protective.
16177,"States with the lowest levels of mask-wearing were more likely to have higher infection rates, according to a recent PLOS One analysis of the 50 states plus D.C., which examined caseloads and masks from late spring 2020 into early fall.And, if everyone wore them, masks were nearly 80 percent effective at stopping coronavirus transmission within a home in an observational study of Beijing households."
16178,"The authors of a scientific review in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, who compiled evidence from the Beijing study and others, arrived at a strong endorsement of ‚Äúwidespread face masks in public.‚ÄùYou‚Äôre vaccinated and headed to an event."
16179,Do you need to wear a mask?Fans are back at ballparks.
16180,High schools and colleges are planning in-person graduation ceremonies this spring.
16181,"States that had banned large gatherings are once again permitting events, such as New York‚Äôs 150-person-maximum wedding rule.When tailoring the CDC‚Äôs mask recommendations for spring events that may have numerous attendees ‚Äî events that may be bigger than a dinner party but not quite public ‚Äî experts told The Washington Post that people should assess their risk and their tolerance for it.Risk depends on a variety of factors, such as attendance numbers, a venue‚Äôs ventilation, vaccination status and whether people may be immunosuppressed or have other susceptibilities to severe disease.‚ÄúWhat we know is that outdoors is a much lower risk ‚Äî orders of magnitude lower risk ‚Äî than gathering indoors,‚Äù Maragakis said."
16182,"But she‚Äôd still recommend wearing masks and distancing at large open-air gatherings like ballgames, until the rate of vaccination among the general population is higher."
16183,"Plus, private venues such as stadiums are allowed to have rules requiring mask-wearing.At a high school graduation, younger students might not have had access to the vaccine, or there could be older adults in attendance at higher risk of getting sick, making masks appropriate."
16184,"But at a small wedding ceremony where everyone is vaccinated, Ranney said, ‚Äúit may be okay to be without masks.‚Äù She, for instance, is planning to attend a get-together with about 15 other doctors and health care providers ‚Äî they‚Äôre all vaccinated, and later this month, they‚Äôll share a drink for the first time since the pandemic began.When will we stop wearing masks?Israel, whose population is among the most highly vaccinated in the world, removed its outdoor mask mandate April 18.That could be a sign of what‚Äôs to come in the United States in the warmer months."
16185,"‚ÄúI fully expect and support mask mandates, by and large, being lifted by early summer,‚Äù Ranney said, as long as every American who wants a vaccine has had a chance to get one.But even if that comes to pass, that doesn‚Äôt mean masks will vanish."
16186,"People should still be allowed to wear masks if they desire, Ranney said, especially those who are particularly vulnerable.And it‚Äôs likely mask-wearing will be encouraged, if not enforced, in higher-risk environments."
16187,"Such candidates include crowded or poorly ventilated areas, at transportation hubs and while aboard buses, trains and planes.‚ÄúCertainly, I‚Äôm going to wear masks on long-distance flights,‚Äù said Jose-Luis Jimenez, an aerosol chemist at the University of Colorado at Boulder who studies how the virus spreads in the air."
16188,"‚ÄúThe U.S. can be a curious place, sociologically, but I think I won‚Äôt be the only one,‚Äù he said, suggesting masks on transit could become as ubiquitous as ball caps.And masks may be needed again during the fall and winter seasons, when respiratory viruses spread more readily."
16189,"For the past several flu seasons, wearing masks has been the rule for patients, staff and visitors alike at Johns Hopkins‚Äô oncology center, Maragakis pointed out.What might our mask-wearing future look like?Some public health researchers believe masks could transition into a commonplace habit, much like placing toddlers in car seats or slathering sunscreen at the beach."
16190,"After the pandemic, more than half of Americans expect to wear masks at least some of the time, according to a YouGov survey in March."
16191,"And 1 in 4 people said they predict frequent mask-wearing.Helene-Mari van der Westhuizen, a physician who is studying infection control at Oxford University, said masks have become a social practice that transcends their medical purpose, as she wrote with colleagues in the British Medical Journal."
16192,"She said mask guidance that treats the public by ‚Äúpretending that we are all in a giant medical ward‚Äù misses something: People want masks that are meaningful or accessible.‚ÄúThat might mean the mask needs to have a nice pattern and fit with the outfit,‚Äù she said."
16193,(See: the matching masks at last month‚Äôs Grammy Awards.)
16194,"‚ÄúIt should mean that they‚Äôre able to pop it in the laundry with their clothing.‚Äù To those who wear them, masks can be visual symbols of solidarity against the shared threat of the pandemic ‚Äî particularly valuable at a time when distancing restrictions can hinder a sense of community.Masks certainly will not be universal."
16195,"People have violently acted out their anti-mask sentiment, such as a woman caught on video who coughed on an Uber driver and tore off his mask."
16196,"Van der Westhuizen said she was flooded with abuse on social media after publishing the BMJ article.‚ÄúI hope that we normalize mask-wearing a little bit more, like Japan or South Korea or other countries where people can choose to mask ‚Äî not because they‚Äôre forced to ‚Äî but because they see it as a way to protect their health,‚Äù Ranney said.The public health experts get that everyone is tired of masks."
16197,"But, Maragakis said, ‚Äúwe would be foolish‚Äù to not consider wearing our masks in the future."
16198,You‚Äôve read that the effectiveness is not 100% for the various vaccines right?
16199,Explain to me what you think that means for transmission!

16302,People on all sides of this are misinformed for sure.
16303,There are definitely excess deaths from our reaction to Covid rather than due to Covid itself.
16304,Increase in financial stress due to high unemployment alone would have caused thousands or even tens of thousands of excess deaths for example.
16305,The problem really is that everyone enters this conversation with a ton of bias for whatever reason.
16306,I honestly don't understand why you would want to pretend Covid deaths are fake or that there are no other reasons excess deaths might have increased.
16307,This is such a weird phenomenon when people with no scientific or statistical background start arguing about this stuff without even understanding the source data or the discussion in general.
16308,Everyone thinks they are an expert now.
16309,and that's backed up by CDC's own data
16310,[removed]
16311,That's fair.
16312,The problem is people get stuck on the first thing they heard.
16313,So the message of you can still catch and spread (even though it was we dont have data to say you don't Media presented it the other way) back in Jan is all they think.

16316,"Perfect, you have quoted the things people always point to to back up the very different statement of ""masks don't work""."
16317,So lets see if you are capable of engaging honestly with this topic.
16318,"&amp;#x200B;

Can you see a difference between 'masks don't work,' which is obviously false, and ""stop buying masks, they don't protect you""?"
16319,Or do you think those are the same statement?
16320,"&amp;#x200B;

You know the second part of that quote is still known to be true today, right?"
16321,"That the point of masks is to protect others, not yourself?"
16322,"&amp;#x200B;

And then you point to the Fauci interview, where he is expressly clear both that masks **ARE effective** in preventing the spread of corona for people who 'need' them (the sick and healthcare workers) and that the **reason** he was saying not to buy them was because of concerns over shortages for those people who do need them, because of those buying and hoarding medical supplies."
16323,"&amp;#x200B;

Also remember that this was at a time when our new cases was in the single digits, and we had less data on pre-symptomatic spread."
16324,"Seems like he was both honest and considered in everything he said in that interview, just like I said."
16325,"&amp;#x200B;

So can you now show me someone saying that ""masks don't work"", or can you agree that no one said anything close to that, and pretending otherwise is sort of revising history?"
16326,"If I were to guess, in a couple of months the government will start paying people to get their shots."

16334,It was kinda crazy how quick it came on and went away.
16335,You got this!
16336,This is the thing I've never understood.
16337,Fair enough we can argue the covid death toll maybe isn't 100% accurate and some deaths may be labelled covid when it isn't.
16338,But you just need to look at the excess death toll and you'll almost certainly see 2020 had the most deaths in recent years for most countries.
16339,Infact it's probably more that most countries are under reporting covid deaths to a certain extent than actually over reporting.
16340,"It was almost two years ago the CDC epidemiologist embedded in China's disease control agency left the post, and the Trump Administration eliminated the role."
16341,"The actionable stupid, in the face of evidence, really starts there IMO."

16345,I guess the numbers there are a bit outdated.
16346,The assumption that people can‚Äôt look at the data and make conclusions because they don‚Äôt know enough ‚Äúscience‚Äù is very problematic
16347,We don't have that data.
16348,The death rate for each year doesn't come out until near the end of the next year.
16349,All we have are projections for now
16350,I‚Äôm happy to have no restrictions.

16547,"It sucks that we, as a society, have to live with these disgusting types of people."
16548,"I wish they would come to terms with reality but reality can be a chaotic, scary place, so they choose to live in an alternate one and bring everyone else down with them."
16549,For starters the UAE used made in China vaccines
16550,My coworkers are like that.
16551,They believe cdc is inflating deaths to include car crashes and suicides....i dont even know what to say after that.
16552,Doesnt help the ones that believes inflated numbers are republican voters at my work
16553,So I mean heart disease is the leading cause of death in the US... but the US government still funds factory farms for everyone to shove their face with steak.
16554,So what's the point.
16555,Lol
16556,Noooooo.
16557,I want one!
16558,I wish I was in Florida right now!
16559,Im familiar with the process.
16560,Seems like you should take your own advice though.
16561,The approved vaccines were approved by the FDA through an emergency use authorization.
16562,Where a panel of scientists analyze the data from safety and efficacy trials and vote to approve or deny the use of a drug.
16563,When they vote they consider the potential of all ingredients and the mechanism of action to weigh the potential for long term harm.
16564,There is more than one method for the FDA to approve the use of a vaccine.
16565,The longer general approval process allows manufacturers to market the product directly to consumers and some other benefits.
16566,That process takes longer and is focused more on safety than efficacy.
16567,Does that mean the vaccines aren‚Äôt safe?
16568,No.
16569,Same agency issuing two distinct approvals with different requirements.
16570,Often probably issued by the same scientists working on different panels.
16571,"Like I said, the vaccines are approved by the FDA for their intended use."
16572,Do you trust them or not?
16573,I completely agree.
16574,I am a vaccinated mask supporter and fauci got everything wrong in the beginning.
16575,Hell he is probably the one that confused trump (hate him or not) in the beginning and trump was too stubborn to change as fast as fauci did.
16576,If COVID is real and can get anyone ... it can get them.
16577,So it must not be that.
16578,Must be something she has/does that they don‚Äôt.
16579,See also: rape-victim-blaming.
16580,"As a current college student, I know of one person who hasn‚Äôt gotten it as soon as possible, most of my friends just got it once the school opened up a vaccination site so it was easy for them to access."
16581,I know.
16582,Sheer coincidence.
16583,I gave her my email address to send me her research.
16584,I'm still waiting.
16585,I offered the Web address to the WHO and the likes but she wasn't interested as that's not research.
16586,"Btw she is a well off, middle class, educated woman."
16587,"You cannot compare the trial efficacy data, the trials were done at different times, had different measurements and the J&amp;J trial started at a later time in the pandemic when there were more variants and more cases."
16588,Here's a great video explaining: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3odScka55A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3odScka55A)
16589,A majority of young people (the vaccine hesitant) already feel that way because well COVID really isn‚Äôt a risk to them.
16590,I walk about 100m from my condo to buy food.
16591,Half the vendors I saw were doing the diaper mask thing.
16592,Saw a few TukTuk drivers not wearing any masks while waiting for customers.
16593,Basically the same as before.
16594,Anytime I point out another country as an example I get ‚Äúya but that‚Äôs a smaller country‚Äù or ‚Äúthat‚Äôs Europe not AmErIcA!‚Äù Like Europe hasn‚Äôt being doing this whole living thing for thousands of years more then we have.
16595,Can we just push the restart button on humanity.
16596,Let‚Äôs just try again.
16597,&gt; I read plenty and I‚Äôm probably more educated on the subject than you.
16598,You must know how silly people think you are when you say things like that.
16599,I'm not even talking about the subject matter of the conversation here; I'm just chiming in to give you a little window into how the world sees you.
16600,Too late to prevent a wave and save lives.
16601,"This is a race, a race against a virus, one that is currently causing thousands of deaths a day in Europe."
16602,Having a Billion unused vaccines sat in storage at the end of summer is doing nothing to help those affected now.
16603,Good bot
16604,"The vaccines reduce the risk of infections by 95%, so let's say you were indoors with an infected friend and previously had a 10% chance of getting infected (hypothetically), with the vaccine protection it drops down to 0.5%."
16605,"Some people are just unlucky, but if someone keep engaging in high risk behavior while the virus is still common in their region, they will eventually get a breakthrough infection, it's like keep rolling the dice."
16606,"As a society we are not ""back to normal"", but many people have gone back to a normal they are comfortable with without the vaccine."
16607,"Many retail stores and states have dropped mask mandates, and plenty of people haven't worn masks in weeks or even months with no repercussions."
16608,"There are dozens of concerts going on in my area this weekend that I'm sure will be attended by many unvaccinated, unmasked people."
16609,"People have been dining in restaurants for months, and they don't care one bit if it is reduced capacity."
16610,reduced capacity just means better service!
16611,You can do all those things you listed.
16612,"The people who are delaying getting their vaccine have no interest in ""going back to normal"" because they have already gone back to normal and they don't care what normal is to you."
16613,"This just begs another question: why aren't AZ, J&amp;J, Pfizer and Moderna being pilloried for their refusal to renegotiate these contracts?"
16614,Exactly.
16615,Just eat a good diet and build up your immune system.
16616,Something most Americans don‚Äôt know how to do
16617,O.O
16618,Wasted effort.
16619,I can't deal with that shit so I don't engage in it.
16620,I just smile and continue on 6 ft away and double masking.
16621,Dumbasses can't even sit to down and contemplate how many of them haven't even gotten a common cold after the mask mandates.
16622,Yup.
16623,This is exactly how my family is.
16624,My uncle constantly is talking about how every other disease seemingly disappeared.
16625,It‚Äôs so ignorant.
16626,"I‚Äôll never forget at thanksgiving (yes I know we had a get together during the worst part of the pandemic I‚Äôm not proud of it), he says ‚Äúyou know I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs fake but we all know the numbers are, have you noticed the flu, cancer, and other sicknesses and diseases have basically disappeared since then?!"
16627,"Someone dies from cancer, put it down as corona!"
16628,"Someone dies in a car crash, corona!‚Äù Meanwhile he‚Äôs sitting across from my mother who is literally fighting cancer."
16629,Oh and his wife who has diabetes.
16630,"It's not just the vaccines that are the issue, the material export ban is stalling out production across the globe."
16631,The flu has killed people.
16632,"The flu has killed vaccinated people, recently too."
16633,6000/8million is .00008% ...that's the chance of you getting sick...so nothing.
16634,Doesn't matter where you go you're not gonna get sick..
16635,"To be fair, you stated a blatant lie about the vaccines in your original comment."
16636,Nowhere did anyone say the point of vaccines was to ‚Äògo back to normal‚Äô.
16637,The vaccines dramatically limit severe reactions/illnesss/death from covid.
16638,It‚Äôs not a magic ‚Äògo back to normal society‚Äô shot.
16639,It‚Äôs not black or white.
16640,Statements like yours only serve to muddy the waters of an already muddy situation.
16641,Your comment is uninformed at best and disingenuous at worst.
16642,Yes government messaging has been mixed as the once in a century pandemic unfolds and our president at the time downplayed every step of acknowledging the severity of the virus.
16643,"Still, that doesn‚Äôt give anyone a pass to lie as you did."
16644,You said the ‚Äòliteral point‚Äô of the vaccines was to go back to normal.
16645,Why should I believe someone who wants to give others common cold just because masking is being an inconvenience to them?
16646,Sorta funny cause I just caught it last week outdoors.
16647,Think it was just a freak chance

16655,Too late for what?
16656,For looking better than the US and the UK in a chart?
16657,What a gross comment.
16658,"This is not a bloody race and it's not fucking ""too late"", the incoming vaccine supply will prevent new waves and therefore save millions of people while allowing the society and economy to go back to normal."
16659,Surely transmission reduction % is going to be somewhat higher than the reduction of infection %.
16660,Reducing symptoms and also viral load has got to have an impact on transmissibility.
16661,It would be very surprising if that didn't get us up into the 80-90% reduction range.
16662,It's going to be much longer than 6-9 months.
16663,My estimate is high antibody titer in all but the oldest population for at least 12-24 months based on the 6 month data and trending.
16664,After that you have memory b and t cells which will reactivate and pump up your immune response upon re-exposure.
16665,"So you'll maybe get sick, but not too bad."
16666,Those memory cells can be very very long lived.
16667,"So while a booster may be desired for those who want to keep their titer high constantly, or perhaps a variant booster (I'm still thinking this isn't terribly likely to be 100% necessary), you likely won't see major community spread through a population after somewhere north of 60% are vaccinated."
16668,"After that, you just have to worry about reserves in animals, mice, rats, etc, reintroducing the virus to a population after the titers drop (which is why we may want to boost yearly or biannually)."
16669,"But so long as the evolution in animals moves the virus further from hungry infectivity, and doesn't mutate into something completely new?"
16670,We're pretty much done after vaccinations are wide spread.
16671,At least you know what's going on.
16672,"I've talked to so many people who give me the ""the vaccination is worse than the virus!"
16673,"The only time I ever got a flu shot I got sick right after!"""
16674,etc because I think a lot of people don't know what having the flu is actually like.
16675,"Yeah sometimes you get some typical ""immune reaction"" symptoms but they call anything that gives you a sniffle a ""flu""."
16676,I hope your immune system figures it's shit out soon so you don't have to deal with those symptoms any more.
16677,Drink lots of water!
16678,You're wasting your time with these people.
16679,"Facts don't matter to them, don't get drawn into some culture war bad faith argument with them."
16680,Doesn't recognize for pain relief or for fevers?
16681,Because if it's the first I agree with you.
16682,Take excedrin (it's a combination of tylenol and aspirin).
16683,"For the second, tylenol is the standard and in my opinion the reason you need to take anything at all for your cold and flu side effects."
16684,[removed]
16685,So we could go to the beach again and not be shamed for it?
16686,"Hard lockdown (schools closed, restaurants closed, mandatory telework, movement restrictions) brought Portugal from the worst reported place in the world (per capita) to a zero death day in the space of a few months."
16687,Hopefully now the vaccine rollout (21% first jabs as of today) can keep numbers from rising back too much as we open up.
16688,[removed]
16689,"It's a problem, just less of one than indoor."
16690,And you need to read what you quoted again.
16691,"It doesn't say that it doesn't happen, but rather than the details are not as explained in papers (like the exact setting, the number of people, which way the airbwas flowing, etc)."
16692,"and the 8M came from the famous stockpile in Italy, imagine the numbers without that"
16693,In America.
16694,In every other country it‚Äôs going to be the most depressing semester of all time.
16695,That‚Äôs right - and Curevac‚Äôs approval is also underway and vaccines will be delivered almost immediately upon EMA approval.
16696,&gt;vaccines are still in short supply in many areas.
16697,Not for long.
16698,Vaccine hesitancy is changing everything.
16699,2.8 million deaths in 2019.
16700,3.3 million deaths (previsional) in 2020.
16701,A discrepancy of 500k deaths even with likely reductions in car accident and infectious disease deaths due to lockdowns.
16702,The GOP assholes who go down this road are contributing to death and suffering.
16703,"The media isn't responsible for the vaccine showing concerning side effects, nor the government pausing vaccination in order to review."
16704,Placing all the blame on them doesn't make sense.
16705,Yes!!!
16706,Great news!
16707,"While this sounds great, I feel like it will take quite some time until everything opens up without restrictions in Europe."
16708,"We had our honeymoon canceled last year and I want to plan our trip again, but I almost want to wait until next year until this is mostly past us"
16709,It makes me so happy that other people see this.
16710,You are so right.
16711,It‚Äôs all tied to the first 100 days Strategy.
16712,"If you see these people, tell them that auto fatalities are up in 2020, not down, even despite a decrease in vehicle miles traveled."
16713,"I think it's in part a vicious circle, though."
16714,"People unfortunately click on the headlines that bait them the most, so the media, wanting ad revenue and clicks, keeps generating more of them, getting more extreme all the time."
16715,I don't know whether there's an easy solution.
16716,I've seen a few people say that the rise in deaths is somewhat in line with the rise of population.
16717,"I haven't looked into the numbers and I highly doubt that explains all the discrepancy,  but they seem convinced."
16718,"Point is, it is NEVER just an ""end of story"" when you are dealing with stats like this."
16719,There are always hidden confounding variables to consider.
16720,"I'm sure the EU has waived some rights to sue, but that's not the same as waiving all rights."
16721,Otherwise AZ could just as well take the money and run.
16722,"I know a couple of folks in this age range who are treating this as another thing on their ""to do"" list, like ""I'll get the vaccine once this project is done""."
16723,IMO they see it more like getting an oil change than an opportunity to get out from under this shit.
16724,"Sounds like bullshit, which country?"
16725,thats a big number :0
16726,*Now AstraZeneca holds over 3 trillion of these vaccines... some of them will not be delivered within 50'000 years*
16727,Interesting.
16728,Should we be laughing at Indians because of Modi?
16729,"I hear this all of the time, but never hear any proof of this or anything like that."
16730,"I'm in the US, and have been of this opinion since masks were recommended in public places."
16731,"Your household should have been included if a family member went to work, went to school, or had any contact with *anyone* outside of your household."
16732,"But Americans had and continue to have a hard time understanding merely wearing a mask in a grocery store, let alone trying to reduce infection in their own homes."
16733,"Sure, they loved hand sanitizers and scrubbing their counters and doorknobs, but they paid little attention to the air around them."
16734,Ask them to mask at home?
16735,Ask their kids to mask up?
16736,*Never*.
16737,I saw a generational family at my Urgent Care.
16738,"They were distraught at the death of a family member yesterday, desperately trying to get tested so that they could all fly to the funeral."
16739,Only one of them wore a mask - and he was the only English-speaker in that family.
16740,The raw emotion of their sadness and hysteria was enough to bring tears to my eyes.
16741,I cannot imagine what it must be like in India.
16742,"Beyond hard to reach communities, college students and folks who can‚Äôt be bothered to get the second shot."
16743,"As a college student, I didn‚Äôt care to do anything that required high effort / too much logistics (including going to class)."
16744,I wonder if being asked repeatedly helps to cement their position.
16745,"The first time they say ""no"", they've considered their options."
16746,"The 10th time they say ""no"" it's a habit."
16747,"&gt;Such dread, such anxiety

No I'm just being logical, no dread or anxiety involved."
16748,The virus may or may not mutate into something that could be vaccine resistant.
16749,"I'm hoping it won't, but I don't want to be surprised in shock if it does."
16750,"By the time the the age groups of university and college students, aka the youngest currently allowed age group to get vaccinated, all get vaccinated, of course those communities already will have had it if they‚Äôre going to."
16751,True that.
16752,The USAF wouldn't have any of that anti-vaxxer crap.
16753,Yeah it's merely coincidental that we had an increase in deaths in 12 months nearly as large as both Cancer and Heart Disease.
16754,We just saw an unprecedented 50% increase in those death totals out of pure coincidence and how could you possibly think otherwise.
16755,[removed]
16756,"Fair enough, experience is definitely telling."
16757,"I know I‚Äôve learned from doctors before that with some colds, people are only contagious for the first couple days, and the residual sniffles are just that-residual."
16758,But that‚Äôs not to say it‚Äôs the same with everything.
16759,"It‚Äôs because Biden made a big deal about ‚ÄúFirst 100 days of masking.‚Äù

Fauci is a politically motivated person who is a friend to Democrats so he held his tongue in spite of the American people, very common practice for Tony at this point."
16760,And what number of those deaths can be attributed to Fauci lying about masks and herd immunity?
16761,[removed]
16762,Ok.
16763,"I didn't realize that ""experimental"" would be such a sensitive word since it can mean a lot of things."
16764,"In good faith, I am just stating that it's ""experimental"" from the technical perspective that the vaccines have still not completed phase 3 clinical trials for long term efficacy and side effects."
16765,"This is the reason why the vaccines are ""authorized"" for emergency use and not ""approved."""
16766,"I also would think it's ""experimental"" because it factually is the first mRNA vaccines to be authorized and the long term risks are still unknown-- this does not deny the fact that the more data we have day to day, the more confidence we have that the risk is extremely low."
16767,Please help with with a more accurate word that's less sensitive.
16768,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt;A pandemic can get you a shorter trial because the high number of cases can help demonstrate efficacy faster than the average slow-moving disease."
16769,"&gt;  
&gt;The first trial vaccine recipients got their shots a year ago and continue to be monitored."
16770,There is basically no precedent in history for a vaccine causing side effects that first appear many months after vaccination.
16771,"(Other than antibody-dependent enhancement, which does not appear to happen with COVID-19.)"
16772,Neither of these points you made refute my point.
16773,I 100% agree that the initial clinical trials benefited from the fast spreading disease and there was justification for EUA and that initial trials showed at least short term safety and efficacy.
16774,"None of that changes the fact that it's still not fully studied for long term safety and efficacy, demonstrated by the fact that even with this history and data the FDA has still not approved the vaccines."
16775,What does the A in EUA stand for?
16776,"When Beijing ""offers"" to ""help"", it usually comes either with a high cost or selling away your sovereignty to them."
16777,I've got two relatively young people at my business who are quite hesitant.
16778,"The concern seems to be about potential fertility risks, though not sure where that's coming from."
16779,Both are pretty far on the left.
16780,"I'm not in any sort of position to tell them they have to get vaccinated or even subtly push for it, we're not a retail operation or anything."
16781,It's simply not my place to advise.
16782,I think there may be a shift when the vaccines go from emergency use to approved.
16783,They seem most concerned the possible long-term ramifications not yet known.
16784,"Doesn't make much sense to me, but again it's not my place to question them."
16785,Haha.
16786,Understood.
16787,Yeah I definitely agree it needs to be all or nothing.
16788,That feels like where the outdoor mandate came from originally and then it just stuck around even after the science revealed it's kind of stupid
16789,"&gt; Everyone I know

I try not to hang out with morons too."
16790,But that's sort of the issue with applying personal experience here.
16791,Been fully vaxxed for a week.
16792,"I'm clearly in the minority here, but I am willing to wear a mask for another couple of years."
16793,"So used to it now, it's second nature to me."
16794,"The worst may be behind us, but let's not celebrate early."
16795,Better safe that sorry.
16796,Take off ur tinfoil hat mate
16797,&gt;Lower compared to indoors.
16798,low comparable to the risk of getting sick.
16799,"Your scenario is most likely, but some people could also have gotten infected in the 72 hours after a negative test."
16800,The flight was on April 4th.
16801,some way the death count is actually way more than what has been reported so to not alarm the population.
16802,others say the death count has been exaggerated to keep the population in fear.
16803,what can one do but to let those in favor do what they want and wait until we see any side effects other than the hand full of blood clots we've seen around the world.
16804,I'm not sure that's really the gist.
16805,The gist is that Tuberville is dumb and him being dumb makes him a bad candidate/senator and while SEC football coaches are an incredibly good group of football coaches that doesn't make them a group of pretty smart people.
16806,"Even though they are incredibly well paid, that doesn't really mean they're smart and educated about the broad spectrum of topics one needs to be in order to be a good senator."
16807,[removed]
16808,They make the argument because there were some clear deaths that were improperly attributed to covid where even though the person had covid it was not the virus that killed them.
16809,When the government showed that it was willing to do that it lost all credibility.
16810,It is the reason they should have been very accurate because when one mistake is found you start to lose credibility and when more than one is found some people will write you off completely.
16811,Well the justification for most of these trials would be to prevent deaths and sickness for example in the future.
16812,The difference in the ethical working of these trials would in this case be largely related to voluntary participation vs forced participation.
16813,Both can yield results where we are saving people from dying in the future.
16814,The latter however is highly unethical while the former is likely not.
16815,"And again, do with my previous comment what you want, interpret from it what you want but my message was clear and I think you should reflect this on yourself."
16816,Thinking that there is a specific witchhunt against you is the same pitfall a lot of conspiracy theorists fall prey to.
16817,I'm not saying you are one but you should be aware to the existence of this pitfall.
16818,"&gt; Some people are just unlucky

But surely that ""unluckiness"" isn't evenly distributed."
16819,That 95% reduction is the average.
16820,"It includes the immunocompromised, the ultra-healthy, the elderly, the young, and everyone in-between."
16821,"We already know it's less effective for people who already have a weak immune system, which had an effect in dragging the efficacy down to the 95% average."
16822,"To balance that out, healthy individuals must have a greater than 95% reduction, otherwise the average would be lower than 95%."
16823,What about the posts from yesterday... or the ones coming tomorrow?
16824,You going to comment on those too?
16825,"Usually those things can be cancelled or adjusted, but that carries a fee (so unles something major happens you wouldn't pull out)"
16826,"As someone who has been around a lot of children, I can say that in my experience this not the case."
16827,The vaccines will keep cases and deaths this low for the entirety of the year though.
16828,I don't wanna be too positive but it looks like Portugal may have defeated the pandemic.
16829,They only have to hold a month and a half cause in mid June everyone over 50 will be vaccinated
16830,This is the sad reality we are stuck in.
16831,I‚Äôm vaccinated.
16832,"Herd immunity may never come, but I can‚Äôt do anything more for those who refuse to get vaccinated."
16833,And they also can‚Äôt hurt me anymore.
16834,I‚Äôm moving on with life.
16835,"I mean, as of now no booster has been announced as needed, so for the real world, it‚Äôs one and done"
16836,"Going by the people I saw when I went to get vaccinated, there were plenty of Gen Z and Millennials that either lied or exaggerated their medical conditions in order to get vaccinated before our age groups were given the okay."
16837,My friends said the same thing about the people they saw when they went.
16838,"If anything, our generations were just making the older age brackets look good."
16839,&gt;Studies have been ran all year that show outdoor transmission to be somewhere between &lt;1%-5% of all infections.
16840,"I don't think, which totally sucks."
16841,The safety of outside has not been pushed remotely hard enough.
16842,It's actually pretty easy to understand.
16843,The Republican Party serves the wealthy elite.
16844,The wealthy elite wants to cut taxes and hoard wealth.
16845,The Republican Party serves them in this by sabotaging the efficient function of government and undermining trust in it.
16846,"When this happens, it's very easy to sell the idea of cutting taxes if nobody has faith in the ability of the government to function."
16847,"The fear narrative further undermines trust in institutions and others in general, cultivating an attitude and myth of exclusionary self-reliance."
16848,"If you don't trust others, you don't want your money being taken away to help them out."
16849,"This is why the Republicans only pass tax cuts as major policy objectives, and never do anything else substantial."

16862,Thats why I said something
16863,I don't understand how you got that from my comment?
16864,I realize the pricing isn't an issue in Europe and the EU would have happily paid an inflated amount at profit given they actually received their doses IE: every other contract it signed.
16865,AZ and Oxford have the agreement to be sold at cost only whilst the pandemic is still on-going.
16866,"This can be started from as soon as June, and they flip the switch and decide to sell at a profit to those third world countries."
16867,"The richest countries have already pledged to give away excess, that's why they've all ordered magnitudes more than they could ever use on their own population."

16869,"&gt;""This will enable free movement and travel to the European Union,"" von der Leyen said Sunday in an interview with The New York Times, which first reported the story."
16870,"The CDC website warns Americans not to go Greece, Italy, Spain or even the United Kingdom, where more than half of the population has already received a first vaccine dose and outdoor beer gardens have reopened along with nonessential shops."
16871,"In addition, Greece reopened its borders this month to fellow EU citizens without a mandatory quarantine if they've been vaccinated against COVID-19 or have tested negative for the virus."
16872,"I understand the point and have been lectured to already in the replies to my comment about how it‚Äôs unscientific and disingenuous, and I get it."
16873,"But the scenario you‚Äôre describing is also misleading, as I see it, because it assumes that vaccinations from the time of the 0.005% calculation have stopped, and therefore the community spread remains constant, thereby giving the fully vaccinated every opportunity to experience more breakthrough infections, which would bring the rate of breakthroughs up beyond what we‚Äôre currently seeing."
16874,"But realistically, more people are getting vaccinated and will continue to be, even though it‚Äôs starting to slow down now."
16875,"(And even though there are plenty of people who will not or cannot get vaccinated, there are those among them who have been infected and are highly unlikely to be reinfected and transmit.)"
16876,So I wouldn‚Äôt expect the *rate* of breakthrough infections to increase much at all.
16877,I think it‚Äôs more likely we‚Äôll approach herd immunity (or community immunity) before the rates of breakthrough infections become a serious concern.
16878,"There‚Äôs currently a study of college students that just began, to examine the vaccines‚Äô protection against infection and spread."
16879,"It began less than a month ago, I believe, and is to last 5 months."
16880,Is 5 months long enough to make any sort of satisfactory determination?
16881,"4 months isn‚Äôt long enough, but 5 is?"
16882,"Granted, there‚Äôll be a control group in that study and regular testing, but is that enough?"
16883,"My point is, it‚Äôs never going to be enough for some people."
16884,"Most people just want to have some concrete idea in their head about the vaccines‚Äô effectiveness in preventing infection and spread, and sadly because it‚Äôs been so poorly communicated from virtually everyone in any position of influence, people still think a fully vaccinated person has a 1 in 10 chance of being infected."
16885,Other people think the vaccines don‚Äôt prevent infection and spread *at* *all*.
16886,"But yes, I take your point about how the lightning strike analogy is highly misleading."
16887,We‚Äôre just never going to have better or broader data for this specific moment in time than the reports of breakthrough infections submitted to and reported by the CDC.

16893,Taking it seriously?
16894,We literally have almost half the deaths in less than 4 months than trump had in a year.
16895,With a vaccine!
16896,"If a couple of the 200 outdoors got it, that a 1 in 100 chance."
16897,Not very good odds.
16898,I will stay out of that kind of outdoor events.
16899,[removed]
16900,"How do you define ""experimental""?"
16901,Who's doing the considering?
16902,The FDA doesn't consider it experimental.
16903,You won't find that word anywhere associated with the vaccines.
16904,"But you also won't find it associated with the original clinical trials, which were definitely experimental by the common definition."
16905,Full FDA approval doesn't prove anything.
16906,"The fully approved Vioxx killed 60,000 people."
16907,&gt;But they also found frustratingly few papers that detailed the settings or clearly compared indoor and outdoor situations.
16908,"Because it's not a fucking problem, outdoor spread isn't a thing that deserves study."
16909,Clearly you‚Äôre not getting the point.
16910,"I stand by my statement, and I think public officials and news media are doing us a great disservice if they say ‚Äúvaccine less effective against new variant‚Äù versus the truth that ‚Äúone study measured efficacy of 92% against a variant, versus 94% against the original strain.‚Äù

It‚Äôs technically true, but irrelevant."
16911,The relevant truth is that our current vaccines are effective against all known strains of covid.

16914,He was comfortable enough to post his comment.
16915,There shouldn't be any problem with him answering an honest question.
16916,I don't see the data in either the OP article or in your new link.
16917,"You quoted someone saying it, but there's no data given for it."
16918,It's not in the study higher up in the article (which is the health care worker study that doesn't address transmission).
16919,"In the OP article, all I see that could be ""data"" is the breakthrough case stuff, and you can't really use that to show what we are talking about (and it is highly misleading anyway)."

16921,Bro you want to live in your house for the next 3 years go do that but I'm leaving my house when I'm fully vaccinated and enjoying my life cause the .00008% chance at getting sick isn't a big deal.
16922,[removed]
16923,Why ‚Äúof course‚Äù?
16924,I‚Äôve read (mainly on this sub) about how the blood clot thing is a statistical anomaly and nothing to worry about
16925,"I could see this at the beginning of the pandemic, but we've done the work to normalize masks inside, so I don't see that being as big of an issue."
16926,"I think the major issue could come if Baker tries to maintain a partial outdoor mandate that's hard to accurately police, like ""Not required, unless you are within 6 feet from others or in a crowded area."""

16938,"&gt;We've known this, there has been study after study saying that outdoor transmission is rare even without being vaccinated."
16939,Yep and not being honest about this has been  a fucking disaster.
16940,"""Oh you're just brainwashed by the liberal media."""
16941,Sure.
16942,"But the weird thing here, which I think many people are missing, is that the myocarditis risks from the Pfizer vaccine *could* be worse than the other risks from the other vaccines."
16943,"To be sure, the data are equivocal so far and it might not turn out that way."
16944,"But even if it does turn out that way, we might not even notice it."
16945,"Imagine there's a fatal disease or condition which kills 1 per million people, but after we've started giving them ""Vaccine X"" we notice an rate of 10 per million."
16946,It seems highly likely that those extra 9 per million were caused by the vaccine.
16947,"Meanwhile imagine there's anither fatal disease which kills 200 per million people, and after we start giving them ""Vaccine Y"" the rate goes uo to 220 per million."
16948,"We probably would not even spot that amidst all the statistical noise, comorbidities and whatnot."
16949,"So we'd be in the uncomfortable position where Y is killing twice as many people as X, but X would be perceived as dangerous and Y would be perceived as safe."
16950,"My point is that we ought to be looking very hard at this data, precisely because myocarditis is relatively common."
16951,The high background rate of myocarditis could mask an increase in incidence caused by the vaccine.

16963,What defines an N95?
16964,I have a box of IIR masks without an active carbon filter
16965,"Yes, they've done similar before."
16966,"More accurate title:

Only 0.1% of the infected never went anywhere outside their homes except for the outdoors, and don‚Äôt have anyone else in their homes that would have brought the disease home."
16967,"The number of outdoor infections is certainly much higher (respiratory viruses spread between wild animals for a reason), but only a small fraction of cases can have confidence in exposure having happened outdoors and not anywhere else."
16968,"Can confirm, live in MN and yea WI is whack."
16969,Because football is a very complex game and if you‚Äôre a coach in the top collegiate league you‚Äôre likely pretty smart.
16970,Maybe not like a S&amp;C coach but a head coach like Tuberville certainly.
16971,So you‚Äôre saying it‚Äôs okay for a sick person to go out in public.
16972,But it‚Äôs not okay for a healthy person to opt out of wearing a mask??
16973,"Also, masks don‚Äôt always work."
16974,Why did masked people get sick while around other masked people?
16975,I don't recall the world shutting down for SARS or demanding masks or distancing.
16976,"&gt;Luckily, you are not in charge."
16977,You aren't either and thank god for that.
16978,We don't need more gambling nutjobs or science deniers in the medical field.
16979,You are citing a retrospective study as a fact.
16980,Which has flaws.
16981,You don't get that and you still spout low risk.
16982,The risk is upto 10%.
16983,And you are nowhere near accurate when you can't explain how it spreads and what factors contribute to it.
16984,The attack rate is also not a base 25%.
16985,It varies from as low as 4% to as high as 50%.
16986,But of course you don't care about those.
16987,Infection fatality rates is 0-5 to 4% also depending on the place and how it is spread and the mechanisms to combat it.
16988,"So you keep downplaying risk, have no accurate info about outdoor spread, don't care about a dangerous disease and then scoff at wearing a mask when there is sufficient risk."
16989,Its because of people like you that we need these till vaccinations reach a thershold.
16990,You still haven't said why a minimal measure like a mask is problem beyond stats that you clearly don't care beyond the lowest possible number.
16991,Those stats have lives behind them.
16992,"People who lose wages, jobs or even loved ones or their own lives."
16993,But you are happy to gamble with that because you don't want to see data in it's entirety.
16994,You have absolutely no proof beyond a retrospective study I pointed out and that too you choose to take the lowest risk possible and not consider the median or the possible risk or the factors that contribute to it.
16995,You keep harping about compliance for a simple thing and then complain govt should focus on better things.
16996,Guess what they are with vaccinations.
16997,The only wide reaching regulation would be locking you in your home.
16998,Mask is hardly an inconvenience and the simplest of measures.
16999,And that too till vaccinations.
17000,And this is a fact.
17001,The virus doesn't care about gambling risk.
17002,If you can't follow that what would you do till vaccinations came?
17003,I shudder to think about it.
17004,"It's true:

https://www.politico.eu/article/astrazeneca-vaccine-shortfall-production-woes-documents/

&gt;While a Belgian subcontractor making the serum or ""drug substance,"" was fulfilling its contract with AstraZeneca, another plant in the Netherlands wasn't producing enough to be included in the company‚Äôs application for approval to European regulators at the end of December, according to EU documents seen by POLITICO and the Belgian magazine Knack."
17005,"&gt;With so little drug substance coming from the EU, AstraZeneca turned to its U.S. plant in Maryland to make up the difference."
17006,"&gt;""The most important quantity"" of drug substance came from the American plant, owned by Catalent, before being put into vials in Italy in a process known as ""fill and finish,"" the documents said, detailing inspections in January and early February of three AstraZeneca plants in Belgium, Italy and the Netherlands that produced vaccines for the EU."
17007,&gt;The documents don't specify how much drug substance actually came from the U.S. ‚Äî one EU official said it was more than half of what formed the EU's Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine supply at the time.
17008,They also don't state how many more shipments have arrived from the U.S. since early February.
17009,&gt;But they do reveal that the U.S. has played a more significant role in the EU's vaccine supply than previously thought.
17010,Whats interesting from an actuarial perspective is that covid mitigation efforts have far reaching side effects of preventing mortality from other perils.
17011,Fewer car miles means fewer car accident deaths.
17012,Masks and sanitization prevent deaths from other forms of disease.
17013,If anything you'd expect aggregate excess deaths to be somewhat dampened.
17014,It was reasonable to assume a higher level of production.
17015,"The setbacks have been enormous, but that's sometimes what happens."
17016,If they can't produce more reliably than AZ then we should not contract them.
17017,It's a bad offer.
17018,"Thanks to Biontech &amp; Pfizer knowing what they're doing, we don't have to take literally anyone."
17019,"&gt; Testing won‚Äôt work without quarantine since the positive test

Not entirely true."
17020,Assuming when you say without quarantine you're referring to a pre-emptive quarantine (but she would still quarantine after a positive test).
17021,"It's not foolproof, but it does add a layer of defense getting a COVID test after returning."
17022,"My wife tested positive, but she didn't isolate from us until after getting the results back and I successfully avoided getting COVID."
17023,"So, yeah, /u/ummwhattxbsjeue go on the trip and get tested after."
17024,It adds another layer of protection and it's not much skin off your back.
17025,Yeah but the rate of uptake when 18-39 became eligible has been much lower.
17026,They've already peaked at around 4% per week and dropping.
17027,And there is way more appointment availability now compared to when people were driving 1 hour+ to get the vaccine.

17149,I think I'm free to comment that an international powerhouse of a Pharmaceutical company as Merck is more likely to have a successful plan and carry out vaccine production and testing when compared to a relatively (When compared to Merck) small company such as AZ after which they've proven to be incompetent at both.

17294,"&gt;Whose suing the eu for blocking the deliveries then?üôÑ

17298,"Every time they set a target, they find a way to further exceed it just a few weeks later."
17299,I wouldn't be surprised if there's another announcement sometime in May that they're even further accelerating dose deliveries.
17300,I think the US had exported more than 3M though.
17301,AstraZeneca‚Äôs deliveries to the EU has mostly been from Catalent in Maryland.
17302,"If it wasn‚Äôt for this, the EU deliveries would be even smaller."

17311,"So when the government says there's a deadly virus on the loose, it's hard to believe."
17312,You can't see a virus after all.
17313,"Add to that our education system is somewhat lacking, which leads to many Americans not knowing what a virus even is."
17314,"So, now we have a good portion of our country that refuses to believe that COVID is real, even when they're dying of it."
17315,"This is a partial list, I'm sure others can add to it."
17316,"The obligations are simply ""do your reasonable best"" in this case."

17330,"The count of total deaths exceeds the expected number in 2020 by about 600,000."
17331,Less deaths than that are attributed to Covid.
17332,You can't argue it's just normal deaths being attributed to Covid when the graph looks [like this](https://i.imgur.com/yEIQcap.png).
17333,I think if anything the number of deaths attributed to the pandemic might be slightly lower than reality.
17334,In any case the total number is mid 6 figures even if it's off by some nominal percentage.
17335,Arguing this statistical minutiae is a deflection tactic for people who have no real arguments left to make.
17336,And in science the default is neutral.
17337,So many people here are asking for proof of no outdoor transmission but you can‚Äôt really prove the non existence Of something.
17338,Instead the burden of proof is on outdoor mask wearers
17339,Don't cede ground unnecessarily.
17340,"People who lie need to be countered, particularly in a pandemic and people who are lied to need to (somehow) understand the truth."
17341,"It's not unique to the US by any means, but we are undercounting the CV19 deaths so I've got no qualms whatsoever about saying we're well over 567K deaths from CV, and that's before we see the damage in people who thought that ""beat"" CV months ago but are now experiencing other health effects."
17342,Every human on Earth needs to understand the critical part of the phrase *Novel* Coronavirus.
17343,Humans have never seen this and don't know what all it can do.
17344,"More than 1 1/2 years later, we're still learning new and frightening impacts that aren't immediately obvious."
17345,I think that's reasonable.
17346,"I just chime in because I want to make sure folks understand that the vaccine isn't ""god mode"" for COVID-19."
17347,They haven't breached their contract and they've provided millions of doses to the EU - a quarter of *all* doses the EU has received.
17348,Immediately after.
17349,Like late September-early October.
17350,"Not selfish, because when it comes to helping one person, your going to help your own country first."
17351,Then why did they import 5m doses from India if it's domestic production is enough?
17352,"The estimates of AZ's domestic production is at around 1-1.5m a week, so if you'd like to count how great the UK's effort would be just off the domestic production go ahead."
17353,The EU didn't block exports because it prefer to aid the entire world instead of only itself.
17354,I may not necessarily agree but that's what they chose.
17355,The EU does make enough lipids and other components to make enough domestically easily so don't start those lies.
17356,"You are correct, anthrax scare was from a series of followup /copycats after 9/11"
17357,"It's definitely a myopic view, it's just one of the reasons , I don't think you can say it's the overarching reason."
17358,CDC just made the dates all the same to not confuse people.
17359,They just recommend more time for the Pfizer shot out of an abundance of caution but according to the trials you should reach peak efficacy one week post shot #2
17360,I wonder who made the decision and profited from exporting them rather than using them?
17361,Yeah I decided Hawaii this year instead of Europe.
17362,I just want a mask less normal summer vacation after the past year.
17363,"Last I heard, the USA has 20 million doses of AZ stockpiled."
17364,AZ is selling their vaccines for at most $4.
17365,So $80 million.
17366,The USA is sitting on its arse for the equivalent of spare change while thousands die every day.
17367,In order to reach the point of creating a vaccine decades of seemingly unrelated research will have taken place to understand how the immune system works.
17368,It is thus of interest to understand how the immune system of a recovered individual works as this could enlighten further drug design.
17369,"You can also do experiments such as proteomics, metabolomics etc to find ‚Äòfingerprints‚Äô for immunity which could help us identify those at risk and assist epidemiology."
17370,"These experiments could also highlight potential  drug targets and allow us to further understand the T cell response, we much research has shown there is a complex relationship between covid infection, antibody levels and the adaptive immune response."
17371,"I hate to sound too patronising but without a solid foundation in medicine/ biological sciences you wouldn‚Äôt understand the importance of these experiments which is fine, but being set in your ways believing they are useless is naive."

17389,Sounds like exactly the reason Fauci told us not to wear masks in the first place.
17390,As far as I'm aware AZ had very little (none?)
17391,experience in producing vaccine at scale but it was pretty much the only company that was willing to try producing in the UK?
17392,"And given the way things have subsequently gone, you can understand why the UK government would want to secure at least some degree of domestic production, even at the cost of going with a relatively inexperienced company."
17393,It would have been a bit much if the production of the vaccine developed in the UK was entirely in the hands of the US with their export ban.
17394,We'd probably be at hundreds of dead a day still in that scenario...
17395,Falling short is one thing.
17396,Had they only delivered maybe 70% it wouldn't be as big of a deal.
17397,"But the reality is that they only delivered 29M out of 120M doses in Q1, i.e."
17398,only 25%.
17399,As it looks now they won't be finishing their initial Q1 target until sometime in Q3.
17400,"And it's not only that they are behind in schedule, but also very much how it was communicated and handled."
17401,"They were very late with announcing that they won't be delivering according to schedule, and even then delivery commitments have consistently been decreased last-minute."
17402,"They are far behind in schedule, very unreliable (large week-to-week changes), bad at communicating and not especially transparent."
17403,"AstraZeneca may have done an effort to ramp up production in the EU, but the question is whether it really can be called a *best effort*."
17404,I have a relative like this.
17405,"I wouldn‚Äôt bring it up, but I feel like if I told him about the increase in deaths in 2020 he would say those numbers are also incorrect."

17409,It's difficult.
17410,Was in the grocery store and it's not required by the state here and the store took their signs down.

17415,If someone is actually refusing to get vaccinated because they want older people to die for political reasons that is just seriously fucked up on so many levels.
17416,Yeah lots of factors to consider.
17417,"I still wouldn't go to a bar that's packed shoulder to shoulder but being vaccinated I'd be fine sitting indoors at an unbusy, well ventilated bar and having some drinks with my vaccinated friends."
17418,I'm definitely not saying that we should all go out and start french kissing one another en masse.
17419,I like the positivity I hope you're correct!
17420,He's well experienced with it.
17421,He was a main player in the initial response to HIV.
17422,The increase in deaths is a lot higher than the official covid death count too.
17423,But that doesn't matter to someone who doesn't understand basic math.
17424,"Don't worry, the death count is wrong."
17425,It's probably higher
17426,Sounds a lot like whataboutism to meüëç
17427,This is the way it should be.

17429,"Valneva literally walking away from negotiations due to clash with EU: https://www.politico.eu/article/valneva-walks-away-from-vaccine-negotiations-with-commission/

Novavax hesitant to sign due to production problems: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-eu-novavax-exclusi-idUSKBN2BH2GY

Both are scared of ramifications in their contracts for supply woes and have seen what‚Äôs happened with AZ as both also have UK based production - they don‚Äôt want to be caught playing political football over supply which is fair enough"
17430,Because common sense isn‚Äôt how science works?
17431,Scientific evidence shows that unless you are right in someone‚Äôs face to face the transmission is still nwglibile outdoors.
17432,Even in a crowded setting.
17433,If it‚Äôs in public and you are walking to work you straight up will not receive covid from that walk
17434,How many deliveries have been blocked from the EU?
17435,How many deliveries have been allowed out?
17436,"How many deliveries has the UK, US, and India made in the last month?"
17437,Maybe he works on a tuna boat?
17438,"Yep Gen x is one of those crappy generations, boomers are the other."
17439,Thanks for playing.
17440,Yes?
17441,Nobody is saying that it is as risky as indoors.
17442,"&gt; And the Merck deal was actually poised to go through, the part that failed was the UK governments requirement to produce within the UK which Merck wouldn't guarantee even if it could have meant more doses for the UK and everybody."
17443,And this ended up making GB have no problem getting vaccinations while the rest of Europe begged the companies to deliver on their contracts.
17444,"It was a good call, apparently."
17445,The EU might have been ok with prohibiting vaccine exports if it was made within the EU primarily.
17446,"Annnnnd one of the most liked replies;

‚ÄúI don't care."
17447,"I'll be wearing a mask whenever I'm near other people, vaccinated or not, for the indeterminate future."
17448,I haven't caught a cold or flu let alone COVID for over a year thanks to wearing a mask.
17449,"Why stop something that's working?‚Äù

Personal choice&gt;Government mandate 
So easy."
17450,Right.
17451,God forbid anyone steps out of line and questions Fauci...who himself has said all sorts of false statements throughout the pandemic.
17452,Never question Fauci....
17453,"&gt;I don't believe it has been grown in a lab setting from airborne samples, just weird stuff like poo, and that seems to be the primary transmission method

Did you just say poo is the primary transmission method?"
17454,Ron Johnson is right.
17455,I got my vaccine already and it's available to everyone now.
17456,If I somehow get someone sick and they end up on a vent thats not my problem.
17457,India has the fifth largest economy in the world and plenty of manufacturing ability .
17458,"Perhaps before blaming the US for India‚Äôs woes, India might want to take a long hard look at their history of government corruption."
17459,"Mayo, Northwestern, or Wash U were my thoughts."
17460,Mayo most likely IMO.
17461,_this guy gets it_
17462,Yep.
17463,"One example, though general viral mechanism discussions in biology texts would be more detailed:

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/fully-vaccinated-people.html 

‚Ä¢ The risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection in fully vaccinated people cannot be completely eliminated as long as there is continued community transmission of the virus."
17464,Vaccinated people could potentially still get COVID-19 and spread it to others.
17465,"However, the benefits of relaxing some measures such as testing and self-quarantine requirements for travelers, post-exposure quarantine requirements and reducing social isolation may outweigh the residual risk of fully vaccinated people becoming ill with COVID-19 or transmitting the virus to others."
17466,"""Vaccinated travelers may thus be less likely to be infected (VES: susceptibility) and to transmit to others if infected (VEI: infection)."
17467,Early estimates of VES¬†for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine are on the order of 60‚Äì92%.
17468,"Therefore, a range of combined VES¬†and VEI¬†estimates from 60‚Äì90% for vaccinated travelers was assessed."
17469,"For example, with a combined VE of 60%, a traveler, who if unvaccinated would be infected and infectious 100% of the time, was assumed to be infected and infectious 40% of the time and a combined VE of 90%, the traveler was assumed to be infected and infectious 10% of the time.¬†"""
17470,Yep.
17471,"Everyone I know personally in Overland Park has been vaccinated, but there's only so much we can do to convince people."
17472,"Yes, and those people who are ""fine without one"" will assymptomatically spread it to the people who aren't."
17473,Eventually it will mutate and the vaccine will be less effective.
17474,"Law of love, my dude."
17475,I have seen the statistics of mortalities broken down by age on the CDC website.
17476,The elimination of covid is more important than greed.
17477,It‚Äôs literally what the CDC has told us.
17478,Of course this virus is going to be around forever.
17479,We‚Äôre still dealing with the flu.... rona was and is never going to go away.
17480,"If you think the worked will get to 0 covid cases, then stay in your house for the rest of your life."
17481,&gt;Let's be fair here.
17482,The American surgeon General was on live TV saying masks didn't work.
17483,"&amp;#x200B;

Lets be honest here, no he didn't say anything like that."
17484,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt; They lied, people didn't trust them."
17485,"&amp;#x200B;

Great, another person who believes people 'lied' about this."
17486,Can you show me a 'lie' told by Fauci or anyone else on this matter?
17487,"Remember, being wrong and lying are different things."
17488,"&amp;#x200B;

Because I have had this conversation at least a dozen times now, and have yet to find a single instance of Fauci being anything but honest and considered in his rhetoric surrounding corona."
17489,"Being sweaty and lying around sleeping and reading most of the day made my hair kind of a gross mess, which I know would be better described as ‚Äúoily‚Äù but I opted for the more colorful version because I FELT like a greaseball."
17490,[removed]
17491,They only like bigly percentages.
17492,Those are the strongest!
17493,I think colleges requiring the vaccine should help.
17494,The government needs to reach out to people like Joe Rogan and ask for their cooperation in promoting the vaccine.
17495,The government also needs messaging that portrays what working-from-home as a new hire is like.
17496,"They need to effectively say, ""Do you want this to be your work future?"
17497,No?
17498,"Then get the vaccine so this doesn't happen."""
17499,"Well, why not, if nobody in Israel can be infected again, let's do a little experiment."
17500,I'm all for science and research
17501,&gt; I have seen the contract and it looks to me as though AZ haven't broken it and that the EU simply had unrealisitic expectations.
17502,Yeah totally unrealistic to expect the numbers written in the contract.
17503,"Except for the fact that you can't transmit an abortion or a gender change on a bus, or at a concert, wedding, gym, or family reunion."

https://old.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/mlz1ye/outdoor_transmission_accounts_for_01_of_states/

17508,"-&gt; Outdoor visitor attractions are banned, including zoos and heritage sites and amusement parks."
17509,"-&gt; Outdoor underage non-contact sports training is banned

-&gt; Outdoor dining is currenlty banned in Ireland!"
17510,So you can not conclude much from that.
17511,And certainly not what you (and most people in this thread) concluded.
17512,"______________________________

So basically no shit... when most outdoor activities are banned, than outdoor activites will make up a negigible part of transmissions..."
17513,"Jesus, my thoughts are with you man."
17514,Everything will be fine.
17515,It isn‚Äôt.
17516,Mumbai has been reporting 8-10k cases since March... they imposed a lockdown recently with strict restrictions and only today they‚Äôve seen a drop to 3.8K... there‚Äôs been a steady decline since March.
17517,Don‚Äôt jump the guns before reading the whole thing.
17518,I don‚Äôt appreciate your pessimism.
17519,Do you really think ‚Äúplane loads of people from Brazil and India.‚Äù Is really a practical counter argument or possibility?
17520,Exactly.
17521,Now you understand the concept.
17522,"No, it was still a place in the mall for poseurs to try to buy in to an image."
17523,So you just wanna flounce around and pretend you're morally superior because you're mad people aren't going to live like its still March 2020?
17524,"Im kinda sorry you had kids, tbh."
17525,"Must suck to have parents that can't think past their own ass or these stale, fear mongering news headlines."
17526,"The virus will just mutate anyway, which is why we have all these variants all over the world."
17527,"Stopping international travel will only stop a certain strain, but not the virus in itself."
17528,"The long-term risk isn't specific to Covid though, and it's far from being the norm."
17529,"There's people who, for whatever reason, get a longer lasting impact from some diseases."
17530,Generally those people have recovered after a few months
17531,100%.
17532,"There's this idea that everyone was either so excited or desperate to get vaccinated that they went wherever they had to at whatever time to get a shot as soon as they possibly could *or* won't get one ever no matter what, and that's just insane."
17533,"Like most things, there are a lot of people in the middle."
17534,heeeeeeeeeeeeheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
17535,"I'd wager that in a large portion of the country, people don't."
17536,"But at least in my state, it's mandated to wear one outside regardless of ability to social distance."
17537,And it's complete bullshit.
17538,"Theoretically, I have to mask up to check my mail or walk the dog in the woods."

17542,"Baker (MA), Hogan (MD), and Dewine (OH) have been great throughout this."
17543,"Sununu (NH) has been solid as well, and New Hampshire has killed it on vaccination numbers."
17544,Agreed - which is why simply who is and isn‚Äôt wearing a mask doesn‚Äôt designate who is an anti vaxxer.
17545,It's a savings bond.
17546,Not surprised.
17547,Doesn't it take up to five days for someone to show symptoms of COVID-19?
17548,"Ah, I see that now."
17549,Thank you.
17550,That seems like a pretty good number.
17551,Only 20% unable to be tracked.
17552,I'm pretty sure 40% of Americans don't even answer the phone call.
17553,[removed]
17554,Yeah.
17555,Hopefully once we get full approval they'll open up things with the requirement of needing proof of vaccinations.
17556,It's a win-win.
17557,More people are motivated to get vaccinated and the chances of spread/new variants popping up drops significantly.
17558,"I appreciate your optimism, so planeloads of people should be heading from Brazil and India and everything will be great????"
17559,"Again, I appreciate your optimism"
17560,"I get your point, but just from what is public already two examples are casting doubt on AZ's best effort and seriousness:

* Blaming its shortfall on ""low yields"" from the very start, while using only one (!)"
17561,of four plants referenced in the EU contract.
17562,That one Belgian plant has said it does not underperform and produces the volume it's supposed to.
17563,Something here's off and someone's lying.
17564,* AZ said it can't export doses from the UK before 100m doses there are delivered to that country.
17565,"Shortly after AZ exports 700.000 doses from the UK to Australia, and the health minister Matt Hancock basically says he had nothing to do with it, AZ does what it wants."
17566,Something here's off and someone's lying.
17567,"Some of that is no doubt political, but some of it is also going to be logistical."
17568,"It‚Äôs harder to get to a vaccination site if you live way out in the middle of nowhere, or don‚Äôt have a car, or don‚Äôt have/don‚Äôt know how to use the Internet to make an appointment, etc."
17569,We‚Äôre going to have to work a little harder to get to the willing but currently unable.
17570,"No, seriously, what's the capital involved with wearing a mask outdoors?"
17571,"You're the one claiming anyone wants to ""sacrifice kids for capital""."
17572,"Other studies are finding a higher number, with 1% to 5% of infections being from outdoor exposure."
17573,[deleted]
17574,I had read a lot about phases 1 and 2 and how the results were promising.
17575,Did a lot of reading on the vaccine technology.
17576,"I work in healthcare so if there was a chance I could make things safer for others around me, I wanted to take it."
17577,Plus they paid me
17578,That‚Äôs not how that works.
17579,"Mutations are going to occur all over the world, so closing off countries from one another doesn‚Äôt stop the virus, just maybe that particular strain."
17580,Discussing it is not the problem.
17581,Automatically assuming the issue exists even when you can point to no evidence to show it exists (something you readily admit to as well) is the problem.
17582,It will.
17583,Israel has herd immunity so it can‚Äôt effectively spread.
17584,The AstraZeneca supply that was received from the US (1.5 million doses) was entirely used up.
17585,There are none left.
17586,Demand is still hugely outstripping supply.
17587,The article said 20% of the total infections were of unknown origin.
17588,Good thing I own a shit ton of Pfizer stocks.
17589,That number of people can't really be explained by a lack of sensitivity.
17590,That proportion of people testing positive is probably not far off the true incidence in the population.
17591,"It would have to be a combination of factors including false negative tests, spread in the flight itself, and possible fake tests."
17592,We've also learned from the US that not all regions are afflicted concurrently or at the same intensity.
17593,"From what I've read from Indian redditors, it seems Mumbai had the first wave and also the first lockdown."
17594,That doesn't mean other major cities are at the same point of the infection curve.
17595,[removed]
17596,This does not mean your chances are 0.1%.
17597,"the information is skewed because nobody has been even thinking about outdoor rates, every case they would just have been assumed it was indoor transmission."
17598,I'd want to see the case study parameters before drawing a conclusion from the 0.1%
17599,Six Flags Great Adventure has the tallest and fastest roller coaster in the country.
17600,"I grew up nearby the place, and while I haven‚Äôt been in years, it had a metric fuck ton of roller coasters."
17601,Outdoor mask mandates are not about the outdoors really.
17602,They are more about stopping people going indoors without a mask from the outdoors.
17603,[deleted]
17604,"You correctly call out that the linked process is for FDA drug approval, but you didn't follow up with anything indicating why you think standard process would vary much for vaccine development."
17605,"I'll give you the benefit of the doubt that you weren't being deliberately intellectually lazy here, so here's the link for vaccine development [https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/development-approval-process-cber/vaccine-development-101](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/development-approval-process-cber/vaccine-development-101)."
17606,"The intent of the phased approach is deliberate and very similar, which should not be surprising since they both follow the scientific process and there should be a high standard for approval."
17607,The main difference is that timelines aren't specified for any of the phases in vaccine development.
17608,Please link me to any source you have that would justify a shorter trial period to determine long term efficacy/safety studies.
17609,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt;That never mentioned experimental."
17610,Emergency authorization does not equal experimental.
17611,"&gt;  
&gt;You are right Phase 3 is not actually completed, it's just underway."
17612,Though the hundreds of millions of people with no harmful side effects who got the vaccine might have some weight.
17613,Ok... so you're essentially arguing semantics here?
17614,You acknowledge that the phase 3 trials (i.e.
17615,longer term studies) are NOT complete.
17616,"If a new vaccine/drug's trials for a vaccine made with new technology aren't yet completed and still pending results, then what would you call it if not ""experimental""?"
17617,The word is intended to be descriptive and synonymous with it being under long term clinical trial study still.
17618,"I mean, I guess we can explicitly call it the ""EUA vaccine with incomplete phase 3 trial"" to be more specific, but that has its own connotations."
17619,That‚Äôs amazing!
17620,Thank you for the response and thank you for volunteering for it!
17621,"May I ask, were you given any reassurance of its manufacturing ?"
17622,And what made you volunteer?
17623,It's not the ideal focus but it's probably the best practical option in areas that aren't very pro-mask.
17624,The reality is that community spread probably can't be stopped in these areas and setting a fairly high bar for immunizations is going to push shots.
17625,Oh believe me I know lol.
17626,"I'm a UX designer and have worked as a human factors engineer on medical devices, and it's crazy the stuff people will do."
17627,"But they do have auto-injectors for diabetics, disposable auto-injectors like epi-pens, etc."
17628,In theory it shouldn't be too hard to repurpose some of that hardware to deliver a vaccine instead.
17629,Then you can have just about anyone do it with near zero training.
17630,stupid question: Can someone explain this graph to me?
17631,"~~https://twitter.com/_stah/status/1386606735746547717/photo/1~~

Edit: the link doesnt work the way I intended."
17632,I mean the top left graph in his tweet.
17633,Wasn't aware we had a vaccine that was 100% effective at preventing both transmission and infection.
17634,Who made it?
17635,[removed]
17636,"The only people I know who are hesitant are young healthy people, most people I know are left leaning."
17637,I think for most of them they just haven't really seen a great reason to get it yet and it only just now is becoming more accessible and easy to get.
17638,"I'm pretty sure most of them will get it within a few weeks, they just were not eager enough to hunt down an appointment 30+ minute drive away."
17639,"Thanks, missed that part."
17640,Honestly I have no issues with this.
17641,"IDK if it's morally wrong or right, but ultimately it's going to save lives."
17642,I just don‚Äôt want any of that in my body.
17643,"Just how a man can choose to become a woman, or a woman can choose to have an abortion, I have the choice of not getting the vaccine."
17644,If I die from covid then that‚Äôs my own fault.
17645,Yeah for sure.
17646,This seems completely reasonable.
17647,Especially being an outdoor activity...
17648,The only criteria that should matter for travel purposes is whether or not it works.
17649,Countries approve vaccines for use when they decide that the effectiveness of the vaccine outweighs the potential side effects.
17650,"But when you're choosing whether to let someone into your country, all you care about is whether the shot they got is good enough to prevent infecting your citizens."
17651,"If some foreign country is using a wacky vaccine that kills 10% of the people that get it, but has 100% efficacy, then I'm happy to let the survivors in."
17652,It‚Äôs mandated in Massachusetts.
17653,I‚Äôve seen people walking alone on deserted streets with a mask on.
17654,That whole argument is nullified when there are no measures taken against the occurring issues.
17655,"If you can‚Äôt finish your dissertation and didn‚Äôt use help, even though you said you would do so, when issues come up, then it is still negligent."
17656,"Also, handing in an essay when the task is a dissertation comes with consequences."
17657,"Well, Chicago hasn't said if they're doing that yet."
17658,But the state of IL is looking at a combination of vaccination rates and hospitalizations.
17659,The problem is that he does not truly acknowledge to himself overtly that he wants to get vaccinated.
17660,"So he doesn‚Äôt actively want to do it, let alone secretly carry it out without others knowing."
17661,"It‚Äôs just that when you talk to him about it, you can sense deep-down that if he were in a different social situation he would absolutely have gotten it by now."
17662,But as far as he‚Äôs concerned it‚Äôs not on the table.
17663,Definitely the positive social pressure is a thing.
17664,"I am hoping there will also be the ‚ÄúI need it for something I want right now‚Äù pressure, like the announcement yesterday that the EU will soon allow US visitors, but only with proof of vaccination."
17665,"Ok, but there's also a million ways to document most of that in a medical record."
17666,But give it some time.
17667,"Vaccines aren't really hard to book, or so it seems."
17668,J&amp;J is back and much easier for public health nurses to distribute to hard to reach places.
17669,"3-4 months from now, it might be very different."
17670,"Even NZ, a country which enforces strict quarantine on all incomers has banned flights from India."
17671,Because even in a well operated system of 2 weeks hotel isolation the risk was deemed too high.
17672,Nonono it's a black and white thing here on Reddit.
17673,Six Flags NJ is pretty good in regards of the Northeast US.
17674,"With that said, Cedar Point is the clear #1"
17675,I don't think people don't want to get vaccinated because it is based on viral vector or mRNA.
17676,"I don‚Äôt understand how you somehow got ahead of the EU with mostly EU-produced vaccines, but at least the doses aren‚Äôt going to the UK."
17677,"Someone is counting chickens, whilst the eggs are still whole!"
17678,"This would work, if the individuals involved in making the decision about who is anti-vax also accept full, unlimited and complete liability for any errors they make."
17679,I was wondering that also.
17680,But when you look at percentages of effectiveness it‚Äôs apples to apples.
17681,"It doesn‚Äôt matter, in fact, it is easier if you pick a population at greatest risk and exposure because you want to test for breakthrough cases."
17682,"See if you had 100,000 people in the study and 50k in the control group and only 100 of them were going to get covid from their day to day wfh jobs then the margin of error for breakthrough cases are higher."
17683,"If 1,000 of the 50k get covid in the control group then you provide yourself a greater degree of accuracy."
17684,It‚Äôs like putting your study on Speed.
17685,.
17686,Not if you let people visit it won't be!
17687,I live in downtown Los Angeles.
17688,19/20 people I see outside are wearing a mask.
17689,Even when I went hiking the other day people would mask up when approaching a different group on the trail.
17690,"That's just, like, your opinion man."
17691,The American Medical Association has yet to release any guidance regarding the use of practitioners of the ancient art of ninjitsu in vaccination campaigns.
17692,"I suppose you might have issues since Fauci isn't, to my knowledge, a daimyo warlord, but that aside I don't see this as a cut-and-dry question."
17693,"If you can't compete with them, join them."
17694,Only thing close is Six Flags Magic Mountain in California.
17695,"They have 19 roller coasters, which is the world record."
17696,"Many people think Cedar Point has better overall roller coasters, but that's a bit more subjective."
17697,"Both are excellent though, well worth a pilgrimage."
17698,You do understand the vaccines aren't 100% effective right?
17699,What's really concerning is your lack of understanding
17700,"Yeah I don't know why there's been so much focus on the ""fully vaccinated"" stat."
17701,People are going to get their second shot eventually and the first dose is the part that has the largest impact
17702,Not like the US will need any extra doses after June at least until the vaccine is approved for people under 12.
17703,Same with the EU but in late July / early August.
17704,All of this is good news because they will go to poorer countries.
17705,"Better than a lot of Democrat governors (Newsom, Cuomo, Inslee, Whitmore)."
17706,"You can if you want but people who have taken a 3rd dose experimentally are getting sick a 3rd time too so you would be getting paid to feel sick every day and who knows, maybe even find out that the side effects from 7 shots in a week is horrible blood clots and death."
17707,AFAIK no one has tried 4 doses yet
17708,Not necessarily.
17709,Oxygen shortage is a lagging indicator of hospitalizations which lag cases which lag positivity rate.
17710,I‚Äôm more concerned that this might be a one off dip or artificiality (similar to states celebrating low cases reported on Sundays).
17711,Need to see a few days or weeks worth of drop in cases.
17712,"Okay, I didn‚Äôt read the article"
17713,Basically it was super slow for the first part of the year and is going to accelerate to a huge degree.
17714,"With a smaller population, an extra 4-5 million in a month like we‚Äôll see in May makes a huge difference."
17715,We did get hit pretty hard by delays in the beginning and a lot of folks are cynical about if these vaccines will materialize as promised.
17716,Our largely conservative media and opposition party are also still banging the drum on vaccine delivery as a failure of the government to try and swipe at Trudeau.
17717,True.
17718,"&gt;All along we‚Äôve been hearing that airplanes are safe, that COVID won‚Äôt spread easily because air flow is always replenished from the outside

That was always nonsense spread by airlines and people who wanted to travel."
17719,Take a few studies in air flow without any actual real-world data and you can claim anything.
17720,"In the real world people remove their masks, wear them wrong, move around the cabin, breathe directly  over the people sitting next to them etc."
17721,And then there are all the issues getting through airports.
17722,AZ had very little to no protection against the SA variant.
17723,I think like 10% effective as far as I remember?
17724,Thats why we are not using AZ in SA.
17725,I was.
17726,Basically they screened me over the phone and decided I was a good candidate.
17727,"I went in, they took a bunch of vitals and health history like any doctor visit, took a lot of blood, did a covid test, and then injected me."
17728,"I didn‚Äôt know what it was of course...until I woke up at 3 am with a bad headache, diarrhea, and a sore arm."
17729,I was 99 percent sure then I was in the experiment group.
17730,Went back a month later for vax number 2 and now I go back every 6 months for blood draws.
17731,What was interesting and frustrating was being vaccinated when nobody else was and not knowing just how good the shots were
17732,"Another note, I work at a grocery store in Massachusetts, and it's one single customer in one single conversation, but I overheard a person saying, ""what's the point of a vaccine if we're told to wear a mask even after we get it."
17733,"That's pretty fucking contradictory."""
17734,This is why the WHO along with 140+ countries recommends opening up vaccine production.
17735,Any official statements and‚Äîespecially‚Äîmandates along those lines should have been revised as soon as the studies showing the pointlessness of outdoor masking were reviewed and accepted.
17736,"It really has contributed to a lack of public trust in these authorities among many, and I include myself in that category."
17737,"&gt;So, we've been making AZ in the US for months and only have 10 million doses at this point?"
17738,It seems like there's got to be more to the story about this.
17739,"I guess this at least means we haven't been holding back that many doses, but I'm really disappointed at AZ's ability scale up production."
17740,The New York Times has had a [series of reports](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/23/us/astrazeneca-covid-vaccine-contamination.html) on issues at Emergent's Baltimore plant.
17741,"The plant apparently ""[had to throw out millions of doses of AstraZeneca vaccine between October and January](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/26/us/politics/astrazeneca-covid-vaccine-biden.html)."""
17742,I think all the 60 million doses that are being discussed are from this plant.
17743,This plant is not being used for AstraZeneca anymore.
17744,I think there's a good chance that more Pfizer and Moderna doses will be exported from the US by the end of May than AstraZeneca.
17745,"This was a balanced piece, but it didn‚Äôt really address the question of whether Florida is accurately counting."
17746,The low testing rate and high positivity rate basically by definition mean that Florida is underreporting the extent of the pandemic.
17747,Typical Modi government trying to save its face internationally.
17748,Modi really failed the country and poor people of India.
17749,If they expanded it to younger people the vaccines would be taken asap.
17750,Right now we are only 40+ still for eligibility so many of us would take what we can get at this point to speed up vaccination rates.
17751,Knowing how likely it is for vaccinated individuals to infect others is *absolutely* relevant.
17752,"You're sitting over there claiming it's ""significant""."
17753,"There's zero indication that's true, and in fact there's evidence to the contrary."
17754,You need to provide evidence for your claims.
17755,"This conversation is over unless you do, thanks."
17756,So sorry for you and your wife‚Äôs loss.
17757,"This is no reason not to export raw materials (and actual vaccines that we're *still* waiting for), as it's a bad thing in principle."
17758,Fauci is partially responsible for those deaths.
17759,because vaccine stops you from getting the full on symptoms.
17760,"I suggest you read up on benefits of, let‚Äôs say, Flu shots."
17761,Why not both?
17762,That would be underestimated.
17763,WHO found the factor of 10-20 in various cities following the first wave.
17764,"Mainstream media, sorry it‚Äôs been way longer than 4 years."
17765,"The two major inactivated virus vaccines, AstroZeneca and J&amp;J have had issues."
17766,Its not experimental you knucklehead.
17767,Stop spreading that misinformation.

17778,That‚Äôs not correct.

&gt;As more Americans line up to receive their COVID-19 vaccines, there‚Äôs confusion over just how protective the shots are against the disease."
17780,"&gt;Clinical trials showed the Pfizer and Moderna shots, for example, had efficacy rates of about 95% against symptomatic COVID-19 in lab settings."
17781,"&gt;So, that means 5% of people who get vaccinated could still get sick, right?"
17782,&gt;No ‚Äî it also doesn‚Äôt mean vaccinated people have a 5% chance of getting COVID-19 or that 95% of people are protected from the disease.
17783,Data suggests risk of infection after vaccination is actually much lower.

17809,Why do you think it would be safer?
17810,"Honestly we are pretty much back to normal with masks in public and at school, but we did go out to dinner inside with our 12 and 15 yr old last night."
17811,It has been important for us to stay positive and reasonable as role models.
17812,"We are fully vaccinated now, and their risk is so low, it doesn‚Äôt make sense to us to continue to isolate too much (within reason of course)."

17817,Perhaps money might change that?
17818,"Next stimulus should only go to vaccinated people, regardless of income."
17819,&gt; Like she fails to understand covid doesn't kill you immediately.
17820,I think you have a lot of people who are in denial and/or are trying to save face unfortunately.
17821,They believed it was a hoax or they believed it was overblown.
17822,Then it personally affected them and they cant reconcile their beliefs with reality.
17823,Its textbook cognitive dissonance.
17824,That‚Äôs exactly the same thing as I said.
17825,If you have 100 clones of you vaccinated and all are exposed to large amount of the virus 5 will end up being infected
17826,How do you feel about the rest of the world laughing at you for being an American?
17827,Not quite.
17828,Look back going 20 years and look at the increase per year as a # and as a %.
17829,The death count goes up year over year due to an aging population.
17830,LOL!

17833,Good.
17834,Better late than never.
17835,"Oh okay, so for example 8 days after the second shot I would be okay hanging out with other fully vaccinated people maskless?"
17836,Isolated from other people like a social bubble
17837,Fly to hawaii and get the vaccin there like many rich japanese people
17838,It's not settling for less; it's taking the first option.
17839,We will all need boosters regardless of manufacturer in the next year or two.
17840,In India
17841,Thanks for the explanation
17842,Imagine 90% of the US agreeing on anything lol
17843,My older father is refusing to get the vaccine and my sister (27) and I (30) both have at least one shot already.
17844,Lots of younger people have more science education.
17845,It's a major generalization to say that kids are a lost cause if their elders are.

17851,"&gt;Efficacy tells us about risk reduction, so people who get vaccinated with the Pfizer or Moderna shots benefit from about a 95% lower risk of developing COVID-19 compared to those who are not vaccinated."
17852,&gt;Still confused?
17853,Think of it this way.
17854,"&gt;‚ÄùIf you could clone yourself and you had one version of you that was vaccinated and then one version of you that was unvaccinated, then the vaccinated one is 95% less likely to get sick,‚Äù Natalie Dean, a biostatistician specializing in infectious diseases at the University of Florida, told Bloomberg."

17873,She also has brain fog.
17874,"I don‚Äôt mind being vaccinated (I got my second Moderna vaccination shot), but I am frightened of actually getting the virus and losing my sense of smell and having brain fog permanently as a result of getting COVID19 even though I am fully vaccinated."

17876,Welcome.
17877,"I'm not quite following you, who exactly has been lying for 4+ years?"
17878,We've of course not been in this pandemic anywhere near that amount of time.
17879,They weren‚Äôt rushed.
17880,The flu vaccine doesn‚Äôt stop you from catching the flu either it stops you from getting the symptoms or ending up in the hospital.
17881,"Catching covid isn‚Äôt the issue it‚Äôs the symptoms or being hospitalized, permenant affects or dying They are seeing that this vaccine also does show it can help slow down the spread


People like you are part of the problem spreading misinformation about how it works or it being rushed."

17896,"Why not read them for yourself: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/coding-and-reporting.htm

The guidelines you talk of were for reporting the case to CDC only."
17897,They want all covid positive cases to be reported but it doesn't mean they are counted as a death caused by covid19.
17898,That efficacy numbers doesn't mean much.

17982,"Cause, having the scenario play out with one of HER loved ones isn't so easy to dismiss, which is why she backs down with suddenly not knowing."
17983,The idea of it being good for the homeless and hard to reach communities is that it is a one-dose vaccine that is easily stored and transported.
17984,mRNA vaccines have pretty tight tolerances for storage (very low temps) and require two doses.
17985,If you want to vaccinate transient homeless people for instance you may never be able to track them down for a second dose.
17986,"They have no phone number/address, ‚ÄúCrazy David‚Äù (the name of nice homeless man I recently met) probably doesn‚Äôt show up in the phone books."
17987,It has nothing to do with certain classes of people ‚Äúdisserving‚Äù a better vaccine.
17988,I have to wear a surgical mask and shield (I‚Äôm an NP in a hospital) I put a small piece of paper tape across the bridge of my nose - no fog!
17989,"If you're low risk, live in a remote region or have a high-risk of not showing up for a second dose, that's a great candidate for J&amp;J."
17990,That definition fits for a lot of people.
17991,And J&amp;J is perfect for distribution to a wider range of clinics and health facilities.
17992,It actually is a selling point that your own doctor can offer you a one-and-done vaccine then and there rather than waiting for an appointment and having to go back for a second.
17993,Pretty sure [most states have databases](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/contacts-locate-records.html#state) that track vaccination.
17994,The card itself is an easy to use record to have on hand but losing it doesn't mean you're screwed.
17995,You'll just have to request another one from the place you got your shot or your state health department if you need a paper copy.
17996,Yes the issue that you are a science denying idiot is very clear.
17997,And you have no impact on real policy unlike a professional.
17998,Thanks to vaccinations your nonsense won't make a major impact on normal folk either.

18000,If we could maybe talk to conservatives without ending our sentences with ‚Äúyou fucking dumbass‚Äù then maybe we could turn this around.
18001,Likewise for conservatives as well.
18002,You could show someone all the evidence in the world but it won‚Äôt do shit if you insult them while you are showing them.
18003,I know it feels good to slam dunk on people but if you guys actually cared about the deaths then you‚Äôd take up an attitude that actually made a difference.
18004,"Again I‚Äôm guilty of this too, I get made and I insult people and as a result things get a little worse....but god damn this whole thread is nothing but a circle jerk."
18005,Zero good will come from this.
18006,I‚Äôm beginning to realize just how awful the internet is.
18007,I truely believe 50 years from now we will look at smartphones like we look at cigarettes today.

18011,"Ask them, if you had a heart attack while driving to work, and that made you crash your car, would you say you died from the heart attack or the 'underlying condition' of driving a car?"
18012,Can AZ just stop giving the EU supplies already so the rest of us can get on with not throwing a hissy fit and vaccinate our populations whom we haven't scared into not wanting the vaccine?
18013,Thanks.
18014,Only way he's leaving is in a pine box?

18016,You say this as if the us does any real contact tracing.
18017,It‚Äôs all atomized testing.
18018,I‚Äôm not even saying I think it caused an outbreak but nobody really knows.
18019,Honestly curious - what repercussions
18020,"Yeah and for a lot of places, this is what ""flattening the curve"" has meant."
18021,"Keeping hospitalizations down so regular procedures can continue to save people , and everything isnt filled by Covid patients"
18022,I‚Äôll take ‚ÄòWhat is renegotiate a contract‚Äô for $1000 Alex...
18023,The EU is preparing to use almost exclusively biontech/pfizer for the next 2 years and increase it's share this year.
18024,So suing to void the contract with AZ and getting part of the 350 Million ‚Ç¨ we paid upfront would be good.
18025,she might be nervous/worried about getting it but feels afraid to speak up because of the vitriol people spew if you go against the grain for showing a hint of nervousness towards the vaccine
18026,"The standard isn't ""loose"" at all."
18027,This is meaningless and false anti-vaxx propaganda.
18028,AHA!
18029,TIL the *real* reason behind those OG Plague Doctor masks!
18030,I'm getting my second dose in a few days.
18031,"while I'm excited, it's a little much to say its the ""best things I've done""."
18032,"I've had plenty of other wonderful life experiences that far outweigh this being the ""best thing""."
18033,I'd also consider working out or eating healthy to be equally as good for my body and health.
18034,"I don't consider those the ""best thing I've ever done""  


It seems a little over the top to tout getting this vaccine as the best thing ever."
18035,It just reads as propaganda.
18036,Pretty sure Rand is an optometrist with a sham certification.
18037,At least that‚Äôs what I read on Reddit.
18038,"I personally agree, but many people did it because they had irrational worries about starvation decades after the depression ended."
18039,Doubling down on that angry man screaming into the void vibe I see :D
18040,"I mean China literally did cover up Dr Li Wenliang from ""whistleblowing"" the virus."
18041,The chances of getting *bloodclots* from COVID is higher than the chance of getting bloodclots from the J&amp;J vaccine.
18042,Well we'll see what the courts say.
18043,But having sixth months to ramp up production in a once-in-a-century pandemic would seem to cover best effort to me.
18044,"I suspect the EU doesn't care of they win or lose, it's just a distraction to cover up their own procurement shortcoming."
18045,They spend every waking moment of their lives from like ages 10 to 70 thinking about football.
18046,Theyre not the sharpest tools when it comes to anything else.
18047,It wasn't early.
18048,"Asia has been dealing with this virus for 20 years and guess what, they wear masks."
18049,"I don‚Äôt usually talk about this, but my dad (infectious disease specialist/pulmonologist/critical care physician) agrees that the COVID vaccines can, and likely should to some degree, be nuanced."
18050,"Those with natural infection do have T-cell memory and do not necessarily need to have both doses of the vaccine, depending on a number of factors that may impact their immune response to the vaccine."
18051,"For example, he said that some elderly patients who survived COVID have died within 2-3 days of their second vaccine dose, and their cause of death is attributed to cardiac arrest."
18052,"But they don‚Äôt actually know if the cardiac arrest was caused by the immune response to the vaccine (the timing is suspicious, and should probably be looked into)."
18053,"He also has concerns about giving all children an EUA vaccine when they are technically not in a state of emergency, which is also a matter of debate with physicians."
18054,Maybe it should be required.
18055,Maybe it should be optional.
18056,"Though there are many passionate opinions, there is no One Right Answer for that yet in medicine."
18057,"This is very complicated, not everyone‚Äôs bodies are the same, and like it or not, there‚Äôs still some things that we do not know (just look at what happened in the last few weeks with the J&amp;J vaccine)."
18058,"There are different risk/benefit analyses for different people that can be considered when also thinking about what is best for the ‚Äúherd.‚Äù

What bothers me is that there seems to be a mentality that it is not okay to ask questions or challenge viewpoints."
18059,"Doing so often elicits an immediate response of categorization (evil republican/Cov-idiot/selfish/anti-vaxxer, etc.)"
18060,rather than actual discourse about concerns and possible nuance for guidelines.
18061,"It feels kind of anti-science to me, since the way science moves forward is through inquiry and discourse."
18062,I‚Äôm sure that future sociologists are going to have a lot of fun analyzing our behaviors and responses to the COVID fallout.
18063,I've been fully vaccinated since February and I've been eagerly awaiting this news.
18064,I was apprehensive we'd hear it this year.
18065,Looks like Brussels in September could be on the menu and I'm ready for some Cantillon!
18066,yeah?
18067,and what‚Äôs that one called?
18068,Really because I read it once and it doesn‚Äôt say anywhere that vaccines are killing Americans.
18069,You might want a better source to back up your claim.
18070,"From the article:

""We are actively investigating this case, but we don't believe at this time that there is any direct connection to the vaccine,"" the company said in the statement."
18071,"""There have been no related safety signals identified in our clinical trials, the post-marketing experience thus far or with the mRNA vaccine platform."
18072,"To date, millions of people have been vaccinated and we are closely monitoring all adverse events in individuals receiving our vaccine."
18073,"It is important to note that serious adverse events, including deaths that are unrelated to the vaccine are unfortunately likely to occur at a similar rate as they would in the general population."""
18074,CDC officials told reporters Wednesday it had not seen any worrying severe reactions to coronavirus vaccines beyond 29 cases of severe allergic reactions ‚Äî or just 11.1 cases of anaphylaxis per 1 million doses administered.‚Äù
18075,"AZ have definitely made a lot of mistakes along the way, but it isn't as clear cut as you're suggesting it is."
18076,The problem with the production capacity numbers you've got there is they're the numbers with hindsight to help us.
18077,"A year ago, when contracts were being negotiated and no one had made vaccines like the AZ one before at the scale needed, the best knowledge they had about capacity was educated guesses, which have ultimately proved to be wrong."
18078,"The contract negotiators probably wouldn't have agreed contracts without delivery dates in, so what could they have done in that situation?"
18079,"The only option for AZ really was to give estimated dates and say that they'd give their best efforts to meet those dates, which is what they did."
18080,"The real question comes down to whether their estimates were reasonable given the data they had at the time, and none of us can know that with the data publicly available just now."
18081,"It also sounds like one of the issues with adenovirus vaccines is that if a batch is going to fail, it'll be right at the end of the production process which is likely to be only a few weeks before it's due to be delivered."
18082,How could AZ give a lot of notice about production problems when they only find out about them just before they're meant to be delivered?
18083,&gt; Perhaps AZ won‚Äôt produce a vaccine ever again.
18084,Gee I hope so.
18085,"i think of it from a scientific perspective: every dataset has noise, and being able to identify the noise _is_ scientific."
18086,It's not ignorance.
18087,Some people _don't_ need to be listened to once you identify that there's no consistent basis for their beliefs or information they provide.
18088,There is good chance that a racist is a COVID-19 denier.

18098,Went to a vaccination site that was completely empty.

18100,"The social fallout of being a retail supervisor calling out is pretty shitty to deal with, even if the state will ensure you get paid and protect your job."
18101,That link doesn't mention any of those.
18102,I am a medical professional saying risk is low.
18103,But not low enough that it should be removed in places where there are crowds of unvaccinated people.
18104,&gt;as well as the fact that in states where outdoor mask mandates have been lifted haven't seen an uptick in cases.
18105,Cite source and vaccinations stats and current laws regarding outdoor gathering.
18106,"&gt;The fact is that medical opinions and studies are actually stacking up in the other direction, and each day more people come out to say that outdoor masking is just not necessary in the vast majority of situations,

The fact is thanks to vaccinations."
18107,Millions of people have an aversion to comply anyway and I am sure it will be lifted soon in areas where is there is sufficient vaccination.
18108,"However, in areas that don't have (which is reducing day by day) masking in crowded areas is still important."
18109,Dr Fauci understands that but he didn't state it so which is why I had an issue with his statement.
18110,There is enough evidence to support masking outside depending on the situation.
18111,There was enough evidence that covid spreads outdoors before vaccinations.
18112,You are not the one who will be talking to family members when they lose their loved ones.
18113,And I don't like people who downplay risks just for a minor inconvenience.
18114,"Every single anti-masker, anti-lockdowner, minimizer, and person who didn't change their behavior will have it confirmed in their head that their beliefs are correct because they didn't personally die."
18115,You have the scientific understanding of a root vegetable.
18116,"I understand her thinking, but the chance of getting covid/passing covid is much lower if you‚Äôre vaccinated, and you‚Äôre essentially guaranteed to not die from it."
18117,"You‚Äôll have to wear the mask either way, so why risk it?"
18118,What‚Äôs the point of that?
18119,"Definition of

18120,Maybe we should check and see if they have 120 volts a/c first this time?
18121,"Yeah, just listen to bolsnaro!"
18122,HE says they're doing fine.
18123,Didn‚Äôt they end up selling all of their AZ doses?
18124,Yeah would love a 6-10 episode podcast or a documentary
18125,No.
18126,Not really.
18127,Covid was identified in China at the end of 2019.
18128,"Didn't really hit the US full force (lockdowns, restrictions, etc....) and become part of the public consciousness until March-ish of 2020."
18129,It was 100% around in the US prior to that and I'm sure Fauci was aware of it and monitoring it before it got to the US but the idiocy wasn't out in full force at that point.
18130,"&gt; It was a good call, apparently 

At the expense of others, apparently."
18131,And now AZ is likely going to pay the price not just in a ruined image but also in courts.
18132,Hope it was worth it for them.
18133,Maybe GB can help AZ out if that lawsuit now took them to the cleaners.
18134,&gt;The EU might have been ok with prohibiting vaccine exports if it was made within the EU primarily.
18135,"It might also have been ok with sharing the burden of shortfalls, as it does in case of other vaccine producers."

18152,And what formal training do you have to properly interpret what those statistics indicate *scientifically*??
18153,?
18154,Or received a lack of proper healthcare for conditions and illnesses other than COVID that resulted in death.
18155,Remember how at the beginning of the pandemic tests and surgeries were being paused?
18156,And others avoided the hospitals for fear of catching COVID even if they actually SHOULD have been going to the hospital.
18157,"sounds like somebody really needs to go outside, mask or no mask"
18158,Nor did you.
18159,That sounds like absolute hell tbh.
18160,"Way to many ads on that site, I'll save you some time."
18161,"&gt; Earlier today, the Governor was on Long Island where he announced that the region‚Äôs 7-day average positivity, 2.76 percent, is the lowest it has been since November 10, 2020, and the region‚Äôs hospitalizations, 540, is the lowest it has been since November 30, 2020."
18162,"If people's decision not to get vaccinated only affected them, then I'd agree that it is okay that they're making that decision."
18163,"In reality, enough people choosing not to be vaccinated will negatively impact everyone else - not being able to reach here immunity, creating an environment where COVID will keep replicating and mutating and ultimately contribute by allowing it to spread further and maintain or increase prevelance..."
18164,It will maintain an environment where mutations will eventually outsmart the current vaccines and then impact everyone that chose to be vaccinated.
18165,You have a .00008% chance of getting sick... And then passing it on to people that are unvaccinated on top of that... You'll be fine to go do whatever you want.
18166,You've not provided a source.
18167,&gt;J&amp;J looks pretty similar tbh.
18168,"80% below target recently

?"
18169,Not really.
18170,"And if anything, we'll see in July - so far they've repeatedly stated they'll meet their quarterly commitment and they've also provided clear delivery schedules."
18171,&gt;Weird how the EU isn't suing GSK/Sanofi.
18172,Why would it be weird lol.
18173,Sanofi simply had an ineffective vaccine that didn't advance to phase III.
18174,If the same had happened to AZ no one would be suing it.
18175,"The most shitty thing is that more people died

Excess deaths are in most countries all over the world."
18176,"For exampole the morons of my country Romania say the same shit 

But when I ask well we have 22k deaths in 2020 and 26k excess deaths so didn't they add 10k of those into the column .... they don't have an answer."
18177,Okay so it‚Äôs the same of someone dying with covid and not of covid then.
18178,Glad we‚Äôre on the same page.
18179,This is a great chart - where did you find it?
18180,"Want to be able to answer the ""why should I believe this"" question if I show it to someone."
18181,My niece complains if she can't wear her mask because she wants to look like her mom.
18182,It's cute.
18183,It's more disbelief at how far the EU has fallen.
18184,Honestly it looks like the UK were the only thing keeping that mess vaguely afloat.
18185,Without us they've gone mad.
18186,"I agree to some extent but it‚Äôs easier said than done, if I went to a hobby lobby in my city without a mask I would get all the death scares."
18187,Ugh I hate that it‚Äôs been politicized on both ends.
18188,Those people aren‚Äôt wearing masks anyway.
18189,It‚Äôs just anti-vaxx rhetoric.
18190,"Wow, I wish I had known this before"
18191,No the chance of them getting sick at the event is .00008% and then getting her brother sick after that is also basically null.
18192,I've just been wearing a well-fitted cloth mask this whole time.
18193,"Once you're vaccinated, wear what you are comfortable with and what conforms to local rules, which may be no mask, cloth mask, or super duper KN95."
18194,You should talk to my mom.
18195,She's convinced these people would've died anyway.
18196,My great-uncle had Alzheimers and was in a nursing home.
18197,A family friend was overweight and had diabetes.
18198,She's convinced both of them probably would've died in 2020 anyway.
18199,It's frustrating.
18200,I've given up the argument.
18201,"Yeah, I saw that, they‚Äôre not going to take it beforehand."
18202,Only 6 hours after/the night of.
18203,"But I want to know if it‚Äôs okay to take it afterwards, even if it‚Äôs not needed."
18204,It says ‚Äútalk to your doctor‚Äù but my mom‚Äôs doctor is actually against the vaccine altogether...so...not a good person to ask.
18205,My government is closing inter country travel but international flights have been coming in non stop.
18206,"It's all about the money, we're just done being blind to it."
18207,If they cared about the deaths and numbers over money international flights would have been stopped a long time ago.
18208,Totally agree.
18209,"And especially the mRNA vaccines are showing to be very robust against variants, but our news cycle prefers to report on the very few breakthroughs and side effects."
18210,It has created a very skewed idea about what is a ‚Äòsuccessful‚Äô vaccine.

18238,That's not a death from the vaccine that's a death after a vaccine.
18239,That's not the same thing.
18240,Wisconsin is moderate in the sense it has gone both ways in state wide elections.
18241,But Madison and central Milwaukee are very far politically from Fond du Lac(really name any town that less than 50k) and Milwaukee suburbs.
18242,You cant just add the numbers together because those who got covid would also be in the vaccinated group.
18243,Hopefully we will see start seeing mobile units at various businesses and events.

18245,No need for an appointment.

18264,I don't think they even communicated the shortfall until the week of delivery.
18265,The company is embarrassingly incompetent.
18266,We all know the moon is a hologram projected by the deep state to keep us from finding the truth!
18267,/s
18268,Would it be okay to switch over from KN95 face masks to surgical+cloth once I get fully vaccinated?
18269,Reason why I‚Äôm asking is because I currently have about 35 Powecom KN95s left and I honestly do find them hard to wear hours at a time (I work at H&amp;M and they‚Äôre required at all times).
18270,Or maybe even just a well fitted cloth mask by itself?
18271,"No because AZ didnt develop the vaccine, Oxford did."
18272,Maybe they should have made it open source like Oxford initially wanted before they got bribed by the Gates foundation with grants.

18375,&gt;The attack rate is also not a base 25%.
18376,It varies from as low as 4% to as high as 50%.
18377,But of course you don't care about those.
18378,The only controlled situation we have is Diamond Princess.
18379,Everything else since then is an estimation.
18380,"Granted that was before variants, but even if you're correct that it's up to 50% that still doesn't equal as you said ""10% risk of catching it outdoors""

&gt;You are citing a retrospective study as a fact."
18381,Which has flaws.
18382,You don't get that and you still spout low risk.
18383,The risk is upto 10%.
18384,And you are nowhere near accurate when you can't explain how it spreads and what factors contribute to it.
18385,I'm doing no such thing.
18386,I am stating that the aggregate of studies which fluctuates between &lt;1%-&lt;10% is indicative of an accurate range of risk as there are no major outliers and successive studies show similar data.
18387,Including the recent studies showing UV light breaks down the virus much faster than previously thought.
18388,"Combined with constantly moving air the ability for transmission is severely reduced outdoors, which we have enough proof of now that we can accept this as more than likely true."
18389,"So let's see...you disregard the aggregate of studies that directly address outdoor spread, as well as the way in which the virus is transmitted altogether and how outdoor conditions disrupt that, as well as all our data about infectious respiratory viruses that have been collected over the last century, as well as more and more doctors and medical professionals coming forward to say that the risk of transmission outdoors is low, as well as the fact that in states where outdoor mask mandates have been lifted haven't seen an uptick in cases...but still want to make decisions for millions of people about how they should manage risk?"
18390,"Sorry, doesn't work that way."
18391,In order to implement mandatory and sweeping policies there has to be a compelling reason that shows those policies are necessary to manage risk.
18392,"It doesn't matter how minimal or innocuous YOU may think it is, there has to be compelling evidence to show that it needs to be mandatory."
18393,"The fact is that medical opinions and studies are actually stacking up in the other direction, and each day more people come out to say that outdoor masking is just not necessary in the vast majority of situations, and especially not to the point that it supports mandating that millions of people comply."
18394,There is sufficient data to show that masking indoors is helpful and necessary.
18395,"There is NOT the same evidence to show it's necessary outside, period."
18396,&gt;How is that counterfactual to anything?
18397,*What would have happened if* is basically the definition of counterfactuality.

18564,Could a vaccine turn out to be useless?
18565,"Just heard an expert say that there will always be some degree of protection, and heard an expert say that the escape-mutations could (atleast theoretically) render a vaccine completely useless."
18566,Which one is it?
18567,Excess death of something like 450K in Russia with much lower Covid deaths.
18568,It's easier to suppress Covid numbers as you can just reclassify it as pneumonia as they did in beginning.
18569,But very hard to not count actual deaths.

18574,I can't even imagine how it was in NYC during their peak.
18575,"&gt; If you're a healthy young adult who has almost no chance of any severe consequences from infection, why would you bother going through the trouble of scheduling and driving to get vaccinated, and to probably feel very sick for a day, when you're still going to be told to wear a mask, keep your distance, skip travel, and so on?"
18576,"The ""Better safe than sorry"" attitude has given the people the impression that the vaccine doesn't actually solve anything."
18577,So why should they bother?
18578,I already got my second dose but I have trouble blaming people who feel unmotivated.
18579,The only reason I did it is because I work in education and don't want to be put into a situation where I'm told I need to quarantine or be tested.
18580,The vaccine exempts me from those situations unless I have symptoms.
18581,It looks like there are a lot of cvs appointments available this week in the Bay Area.
18582,"Not *liking* it and hoping that we can safely stop doing it soon is not the same as saying ‚Äúthe minor inconvenience isn‚Äôt worth it.‚Äù I haven‚Äôt entered a building other than my own home without one in over a year, but I‚Äôm still not enjoying it, and would like for it to be done soon."
18583,And for a lot of people at that age 100 bucks is a enough encouragement
18584,[deleted]
18585,I'm disappointed that the article didn't mention a percentage of breakthrough infections requiring hospitalization or resulting in death.
18586,As a Pfizer vacc'd person with plenty of covid patients in my area that is the metric I'm most interested in.
18587,I do expect breakthrough infection in some folks but most important to me would be the weight they lay on the healthcare infrastructure.
18588,I'm going to do some digging and see if anywhere else has this info but I appreciate the article.
18589,I mean most of the rides and dining are outside so that would pretty much mean no masks.
18590,The numbers won't support many restrictions by then anyways.
18591,Kramer: They write it off Jerry!
18592,Weird coincidence that cases are rising in about half the states.
18593,This is really smart.
18594,Hits the people who are least likely to get the vaccine and the most likely to be the ones that a $100 savings bond is attractive.
18595,"At $50 per bond, that‚Äôs a good program."
18596,I care about what the maskless do because there are many aspects of life that will not return to normal until case counts are mitigated.
18597,"I currently work from home and hate it, but this isn't something I can fix by simply declaring myself not afraid of the virus and not wearing my mask."
18598,"It's something that is literally determined by how much other people spread covid, so I absolutely do care about what they do."
18599,I don't want to give up.
18600,"However, I think we'll get (some of) the remaining people to get vaccinated faster if we give them a carrot:  Get vaccinated, and no more masks."
18601,"Get vaccinated, and we'll shut up."
18602,"Get vaccinated, and we'll leave you alone."
18603,"Right now, the messaging is get vaccinated and maybe someday, eventually, when it's safe, we might let you go back to normal."
18604,So these people say why bother?
18605,"&gt;once the vaccine clear federal safety reviews

I was confused by this, but further reading indicates:

&gt; About 10 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine have been produced but have yet to pass review by the FDA to ‚Äúmeet its expectations for product quality,‚Äù Zients said, noting the U.S. regulator is recognized as the ‚Äúgold standard‚Äù for safety around the world."
18606,"So these ""safety reviews"" are not Emergency Approval for use in the US, but rather quality control to ensure the doses that have been manufactured were manufactured to safety standards."
18607,"Either way this is good news, but I'm pretty shocked by this:   


&gt; About 10 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine have been produced but have yet to pass review by the FDA to ‚Äúmeet its expectations for product quality,‚Äù 

So, we've been making AZ in the US for months and only have 10 million doses at this point?"
18608,It seems like there's got to be more to the story about this.
18609,"I guess this at least means we haven't been holding back *that many* doses, but I'm really disappointed at AZ's ability scale up production."

18642,This is absolutely untrue.
18643,While they are far more likely to wear them once they're sick (a habit I'd be fine with picking up in the US) this idea that they're part of day-to-day living is ridiculous.

18713,"I'm no international lawyer, but if there are any americans that paid taxes to the american government for 2020 and are the sole occupants of very small island, say, near port blair, the indian gov't could sell this tiny island to the US, dating the sale to the date the american moved there in 2020."
18714,"Then, the vaccine could be given to anyone visiting said american, on this american island, and maybe this would be allowed under the contract with the pharmaceutical company that specifies the vaccine can only be given to people on American soil."

18733,Then they'll want it to keep going the next 2 years so they can use it to get the presidency back.
18734,Don't expect them to stop anytime soon.

18747,Everything I‚Äôve done is to protect others and now that I‚Äôm vaccinated I would happily attend a concert tomorrow with a full house.
18748,I think everyone has to make decisions now that are best for them post-vaccine and not judge those who have moved on or haven‚Äôt.
18749,I do have a friend who is borderline agoraphobic now and I think I may need to get her some help at some point.
18750,And she is very judgmental of me for resuming my life post-vaccine which is straining our relationship.

18818,&gt;The conversation needs to be about the vaccine returning us to normalcy.
18819,Anything less than that validates the growing apathy we're seeing have serious consequences.
18820,"It's great that we were able to get to a majority of adults vaccinated before running into wide scale apathy, but the apathy is here and it needs to be dealt with."
18821,"I really think they (CDC) are so scared about a minority of the population exploiting the whole ""vaccinated = no mask"" thing that they're failing to see the bigger picture."
18822,Sure people are going to be assholes and pretend that they're vaccinated to get by without wearing masks but guess what?
18823,THEY WERE ALREADY NOT WEARING A MASK IN THE FIRST PLACE!
18824,I think it‚Äôs a personal risk assessment based on what you can handle mentally.
18825,"I wouldn‚Äôt be swayed by people saying ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry it‚Äôs completely safe the data shows you can‚Äôt infect someone if you‚Äôre vaccinated,‚Äù because that‚Äôs simply not known at this point."
18826,"By that same token, I wouldn‚Äôt listen to doomsayers saying you‚Äôre passing on an insanely risk to your sibling."
18827,"The truth is it‚Äôs probably not highly likely anything bad will happen, but it‚Äôs not impossible."
18828,"Definitely a tough decision, there are many of us struggling to manage personal risk so you‚Äôre not alone!"

18834,"Experts: evolution of variants with increased resistance to vaccines is a serious concern and one we need to act proactively on

This subreddit: there is basically no chance of variants being an issue and we shouldn't do anything about it"
18835,I have a good collection of both liberal and conservative friends.. Ironically it was the liberal side that wanted nothing to do with it at first because it was a trump vaccine.
18836,My associate at work was one until I told her that the Pfizer one was made by a German company that is allowing Pfizer to produce it because they don't have the capacity to do so.
18837,The election happened and it was like a complete 180 with who was or wasn't going to get it.
18838,Busting balls on FB about it and everything.
18839,I know the one who's always busting others balls got his because his wife told me.
18840,It's all about appearance.
18841,"Also I had covid early on and it was 3.5 weeks of hell, I've had Cpox twice, I've had Shingles at 32 if anyone could get this shit again it would be me and hell if I'm going through that again."
18842,Yea I don‚Äôt really see poorer countries having the infrastructure in place to store mRNA vaccines.
18843,"J&amp;J maybe, and I‚Äôm pretty sure we‚Äôll start donating those too sometime around/after summer once we‚Äôve inoculated everyone we can"
18844,I called it a comparison.
18845,"You decided to ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù me and call it an analogy, and I‚Äôm being obvious?"
18846,Ok champ.
18847,"There is only one ""strain"", and ""double mutant"" is a buzzword"
18848,"This is what I don't get, why is there any International Traveling going on at all?"
18849,Why is it so hard for all of the countries just to accept that no one should be moving around at all for the next 6 months and we can get COVID under control.
18850,"Yes, it sucks for 6 months, but these world travelers are just prolonging the Pandemic."
18851,"&gt;Oh no, we had people spouting out information to precautiously wear a cloth mask on their face outside the last year, the horrors!"
18852,It was not supported by science.
18853,It sucks that the j&amp;j incident perfectly aligned with our inflection point.
18854,Talk about sucky timing
18855,Isn't the state run by Republicans who don't believe in vaccines?

18860,My apologies.
18861,"But still in the states, the elderly recieved the shot for months before younger people, so the trade-off is kinda fair"
18862,Moderna also has an additional week in its single-dose window which could be a bit of an advantage since immunity may continue to build during that week.
18863,Canada received the 1.5M AZ doses promised.
18864,I have a shot of good ol' batch NA0079 in my arm as we speak.

18901,"And if people aren't taking the vaccine, you have to find ways to incentivise it"
18902,"Don't take medical advice from a rando over the internet, but your chances of having myocarditis anyways is about 0.01% ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459259/#:\~:text=The%20incidence%20of%20myocarditis%20is,is%20unknown%20and%20probably%20underdiagnosed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459259/#:~:text=The%20incidence%20of%20myocarditis%20is,is%20unknown%20and%20probably%20underdiagnosed).)"
18903,Compared to what Israel saw of an incremental 0.00001%.
18904,"So even if this was caused by the vaccine, your chances of getting myocarditis go from 0.01% to 0.01001%."
18905,That shouldn't warrant a desire to not vaccinate.
18906,An acquaintance had their wedding in India in late March.
18907,They got permission for 100 attendees as long as everyone had negative covid test reports.
18908,The solution?
18909,"Bribe the testing center, send them a list of names and get negative test 'results' for everyone."
18910,"The checking was lax anyway, and from what I hear the number of attendees numbered much more than 100."
18911,And this is an educated family in India.
18912,Pure wtf-ness.

18916,It's retroactive
18917,[removed]
18918,the US government will not take external data like this into account because it is happening in another country.
18919,"There are too many factors to account for such as environment, diet, exposure, etc in those other countries for the US to hold the findings against their own population."
18920,"If something similar was happening here, they would look into it."

18930,Restaurants are limited to 4 people and close at 10pm.
18931,Reading your post history you said that hotter weather made COVID drop down to 0-2 cases which is not the reason‚Äî it‚Äôs because of those lockdown measures and contact tracing with the LeaveHomeSafe App
18932,Practically every other state is now clocking in with less daily deaths than Florida.

18944,Budweiser's promotion is still running
18945,"&gt;but it is 100% socially unacceptable to be unmasked outdoors, 

That's just not right."
18946,So someone not wearing a mask is shunned because they either know the science and extremely low covid risk outside and/or use common sense to judge when and where to wear a mask.
18947,The media sure has done some serious damage to these people.
18948,Yeah okay.
18949,Actually I live in Israel and got my shot on december 22 :)
18950,I'm not sure and I definitely agree with your point.
18951,If you stall out way below that number and can't hit it...that's probably just as bad.
18952,"The only thing is, I think not having an end goal or endpoint is even worse."
18953,How do you convince a lazier or slightly hesitant person to get a vaccine if there is no end in sight?
18954,"And currently, that endpoint continues to require capacity limits, masking, and social distancing."
18955,I think a firm goal might motivate a lot of fence-sitters to go get it as quickly as possible.
18956,Maybe we need a push in messaging?
18957,"Hesitancy in a lot of states is extremely low (less than 15% and many states close to 10%), yet even in those states, they are still seeing huge drop-offs in demand."
18958,Something isn't adding up.
18959,Am woman.
18960,Can frustratingly confirm.
18961,Why you vaccinating kids?
18962,"Thanks, that's a helpful link."
18963,"But, to my point, while many of these areas are down compared to the baseline in various areas, there's no evidence that they've instituted some kind of recent pseudo-lockdown in the last few weeks."

18967,What a time to be alive.
18968,What I found particularly encouraging was that it had no side effects.
18969,Anyone who has stood by their kids side while they blew chunks for hours after ingesting Tamiflu can appreciate an anti-viral that doesn't cause nausea.
18970,I'm aggregating CDC and MDPH data in 1 mega-google sheet.
18971,Dates all the way to December 14th with the full MA data with both sources each.
18972,"No, it absolutely does not."
18973,A new strain would be an entirely new disease.
18974,"&gt;Shaming seems to be the only thing we've tried so far

Not just shaming but shaming with a smug sense of superiority mixed in."
18975,It literally makes people dig-in even more.
18976,Not the best way to reach people.
18977,"Yeah, this issue is definitely in the national consciousness."
18978,"Biden is going to announce some changes to the recommendations for the vaccinated tomorrow which will loosen things up at least somewhat, but probably not enough to make people happy."
18979,The tension is that they can't explicitly say that they don't trust the unvaccinated not to lie us right back into a new wave because they can't be adults about it.
18980,The real question is where did they get that bogus information about car/suicides being rolled into the covid deaths.
18981,Who started that BS?

18988,Is it not okay to question something that we have no long term tests for?
18989,There are numerous examples of things science said was safe until we got long term data back and it wasn‚Äôt.
18990,I‚Äôm in a higher risk group so I gladly got my shot as soon as I could but if a healthy 20 something wants to pass on the shot I don‚Äôt blame them.

18994,"In OPs case, she is young as so are her friends."
18995,All of them are vaccinated.
18996,The chance of an infection happening that should could bring home to her unvaccinated brother is infinitesimally small.
18997,Data from Israel actually shows us how well the vaccines really do work.
18998,They only have just under 58% fully vaccinated (and 67% with 1 dose) and cases have been plummeting even while being almost completely open and unrestricted.

19374,The Biden administration needs to catch up to the real world.
19375,Agreed it‚Äôs so cringey at this point.
19376,It‚Äôs a fact the numbers are inflated in USA.
19377,People don‚Äôt keep their mask on all the time or properly.
19378,"They definitely remove it to eat or drink, for one."
19379,And a huge number have no clue how the respiratory system works and leave their noses hanging out.
19380,[removed]
19381,Weird.
19382,I got sick a few months ago.
19383,"When I went to the doctor, they tested me for Covid, and the flu, at the same time."
19384,"It makes sense, because the symptoms could be similar."
19385,"FYI, I had neither; it was a head cold."
19386,"Also, I knew the Covid test would be free, but they didn't charge me for any of that visit."
19387,All I had to pay for was the meds for my head cold.
19388,I went to a walk-in clinic associated with the hospital.
19389,Just thought that might help anyone in the US worried about paying for a doctor's appointment right now.
19390,"Go to a clinic on a hospital network, and tell them you think you might have Covid."
19391,Finally!
19392,!
19393,Another nail in the coffin of outdoor mandates.
19394,Hopefully Biden and the CDC will announce a big change in guidance tomorrow and not hedge bets.

19396,"God damnit, send me one."
19397,I hate needles
19398,"I can speak to Pfizer because they had this data in their study, but efficacy from dose two through six days after dose two was estimated at 91%, and for seven days or more was estimated at 95%."
19399,No reason that I know of to think Moderna would be different but I haven't seen that data for it.
19400,Personally I'm in the same boat (just got dose #2 an hour ago!)
19401,and I'm going out this weekend to do some stuff (including attending an outdoor sporting event in person) but it's going to be a personal risk assessment for everyone.
19402,I don't understand how it limits your peripheral vision.
19403,At least not it any major way.
19404,Just genuinely confused about that.
19405,But I hope you can figure out some way to get the issue resolved.
19406,NY is mandating masks where you can't social distance.
19407,"Which pretty much means ""all of NYC"" I'd say there's 95% mask compliance in Central Park and on the sidewalks near me."
19408,"I believe it's not being actively enforced outdoors for practical reasons, but most people are following it."
19409,"They could argue that, they would be wrong but they could argue it."
19410,Words have meanings and in this case district has one meaning and state has another.
19411,"Getting our first hints at how NY is going to handle this summer:

&gt;The Great New York State Fair will go on!"
19412,"&gt;This year, @NYSFair will return starting August 20th and will run the full 18 days **at reduced capacity."
19413,"**

Reduced capacity, outdoors, in a huge area in 3.5 months from now."
19414,So you think 30% is very low?
19415,"Can you please also see the rest of the world's data (the general picture, not just some specific countries)?"
19416,Sure.
19417,"My point is that he‚Äôs not a bad senator because he‚Äôs a former football coach, because my point is that senators come from all different backgrounds."
19418,"He could be a bad senator because he‚Äôs not knowledgeable about politics, that‚Äôs an argument, but it‚Äôs not just because he‚Äôs a former football coach that makes him a bad senator."
19419,"There‚Äôs actually a number of former professional athletes that held office, some good, some bad."
19420,You can be good at sports and also good at politics.
19421,"But my point is strictly because you‚Äôre really knowledgeable about sports doesn‚Äôt make you not a good politician

19423,"Seriously,  for the first few months in spring summer 2020 the EDs were very quiet for non covid patients."
19424,I usually see around 1 appendicitis a day but it was more like 1 per week.
19425,I was like where are all these patients?
19426,Surely they are still getting appendicitis under a lock down.
19427,Some or many of them just were not willing to come to the ED and tried to tough it out at home.

19454,"I live in Phoenix and I can go to the store, walk down the street, eat in a restaurant, etc and never be within a couple feet of someone for more than 10 seconds without even trying."
19455,Compare that to a place like Atlanta or NYC - good luck.

19459,Was very surprised to hear that considering that they have about 30K cases and they are number 6 in the world in terms of vaccinations.
19460,I have read somewhere that they did this intentionally to open up the tourist season in June.
19461,Will see if that‚Äôs true
19462,This is the answer that should have been given.
19463,"I'm sure people will lose their mind over this, but the question that was asked isn't completely absurd."
19464,"If we are establishing that a very small percentage of the population has extreme reactions to COVID (as most are either asymptomatic or have mild symptoms) AND those individuals were able to be vaccinated, thus reducing their chances of extreme health problems AND there isn't enough evidence to show that being vaccinated stops you from spreading the disease, then the only real reason to get vaccinated is to prevent yourself from becoming very ill or worse."
19465,"If someone isn't concerned about that, then what is the reason to get vaccinated?"
19466,"It 100% tracks logically....

That is, until you bring up the idea that the fewer people who contract COVID means fewer chances of replication."
19467,"However, this is also predicated upon the concept that vaccination slows transmission and mutation."
19468,I have not seen where this has been reported.
19469,All I've seen that is KNOWN at this point is that is massively reduces the chances of extreme illness or death.
19470,I have been vaccinated due to the industry I work in.
19471,I did this based on the possibility that it might help prevent spread to others.
19472,Y‚Äôall still can‚Äôt meme.
19473,"Not surprised, y‚Äôall have the collective IQ of a forklift."
19474,"Same, if we could help lower deaths from things like the flu in the future even just from masks!?!?"
19475,Like wow my only regret will be not adopting the practice sooner.
19476,That would destroy the pharmaceutical industry in the states.
19477,Sharing vaccines is a great idea (see Biden's announcement today).
19478,Sharing IP makes zero sense.
19479,Do you think there is a bunch of vaccine manufacturing capacity with the ability to produce mRNA vaccines just sitting idle somewhere?
19480,Really?
19481,Lucky you.
19482,Im not sure I understand why you care if the US doesn't have a need for the AZ vaccine.
19483,As per the article they clearly won't go to waste if that's your concern.
19484,Everybody happy surely?
19485,Data collected 1/1-3/31.
19486,"Out of 44k fully vaccinated: 30 infections, 8 asymptomatic."
19487,I think these shots might work.
19488,YA'LL- PLEASE GET VACCINATED

19492,I'm not talking about the EU or other first-world countries.
19493,It‚Äôs nearly 100% effective against death and serious illness.
19494,Just remember that.
19495,"Ah yeah, state senator you can hang up on"
19496,"The thing is, even IF the number was somehow inflated, it doesn't change the fact that a shitton of people at the minimum died to the virus, so how the heck can you state inflated numbers as a damn excuse?"

19500,Herd immunity will be reached in the deep south because of the high level of infection there last summer.
19501,The success seen in Texas isn't at the moment isn't entirely attributable to the vaccine - many in Texas have antibodies from prior infection.
19502,Will agree that the EU has scapegoated  AZ.
19503,But the EU absolutely has a case against AZ in court.
19504,They should have bought enough mRNA to cover everyone in the EU
19505,Particularly because millions of adults between ages 60-64 didn‚Äôt even qualify till early April (e.g.
19506,"in CA), or April 19th depending on the state."
19507,Let alone those 50+ or those with comorbidities.
19508,"So that means it‚Äôs entirely possible they didn‚Äôt qualify before they got COVID, or couldn‚Äôt get an appointment."
19509,It‚Äôs an asinine thing to ask.
19510,People are so dumb
19511,And then you call them an idiot and remind them that you don't have discussions with toddlers.
19512,Missing because turnout has declined before johnson and johnson was put back on in Florida
19513,Few if any countries have the same economic power as the United States in this scenario
19514,&gt; Excess deaths is the best way to counter this.
19515,The [CDC has a website for this](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm) and one of the first options on the graph down the page can show with and without COVID numbers.
19516,"As much as we should hold politicians accountable for the job they do and how much is needed from a policy and enforcement standpoint, the driver of covid will always be population density."
19517,After that it‚Äôs the how the population responds.
19518,"NYC was pretty strict, but are we 100% sure it‚Äôs citizens weren‚Äôt still gathering at one another‚Äôs houses at the same rate as they were in Florida?"
19519,Because if so no amount of masks is going to save you from being in the same small room as someone else
19520,Were you even alive I'm the 80s?
19521,What are you basing this off of?
19522,Personally the first time I ever heard of global warming was in 2005 attending a speech by Al Gore and the only reason I even had that opportunity was because  I lived in Nashville.
19523,I literally had to sneak in.
19524,"I wasn't ignorant either, I distinctly remember Gore talking about how a big problem he was running into with people who attended these presentations is how many went from not even knowing about global warming to being completely fatalistic about it."
19525,"PS: And sure everyone had heard of pandemics before, but how many actually thought they would live through one?"
19526,Thanks!
19527,"I feel like in the US, voluntary extreme social distancing and declining vaccination are not in the same group."

19532,I am pissed off too.
19533,These people are just murderers.

19539,Good.
19540,"I don't really enjoy wearing a mask in the warmer months (I actually like it for the winter, however)."
19541,People seem to expect a simple 1 size fits all set of instructions.
19542,Either wear a mask at all times or never at all.
19543,It is just too complicated to figure out themselves when its appropriate to wear a mask when inside or in a crowded area vs not wearing one when alone or when in a sparsely occupied outdoor area.

19580,So 4 weeks total or one week after getting the second dose should be a relatively high level of efficacy reaching its maximum protection a week after that?
19581,Approved by the FDA?
19582,"Thats not true, they were given emergency use authorization but no Covid Vaccine is approved by them."
19583,Well common sense will tell you that medical masks for hospitals and masks that we buy at the grocery store are not from the same supply chain.

19612,"&gt;  
&gt;I mean, yeah, but ... what was the point of vaccines, then?"
19613,The vaccine protects people in multiple ways.
19614,"There's the obvious ""95% effective"" individual protection."
19615,But there's also protection from widespread vaccination reducing community spread of the virus.
19616,People are 100% protected if they are not coming into contact with the virus.
19617,The number of cases is going down in places with a lot of vaccinated people.
19618,You won't have to wait too much longer before low spread protects even those children and people who can't get the vaccination for medical reasons.
19619,Really?
19620,How about the Indian actor that died like 48 hours after getting the shot.
19621,"If that shot was instead a positive test, you can't tell me that wouldn't get logged as a CV-19 death."
19622,At this point I would not be relieved to step out of my house in India until we give vaccines to atleast 50 percent with one dose atleast in my state.
19623,And our govt always gives mixed messaging also.
19624,They say we have oxygen when in reality ppl die on the next street to their office.
19625,Ppl here drink cowpiss(literally yes) and eat all those herbal shits instead of taking a safe and effective vaccine.
19626,Still the deaths here are above 60 which cld have been avoided if those ppl took the vaccine last month when we opened to all above 60.
19627,Fellow indians I'm not discouraging but this now is like a black death like situation for all of us now.
19628,We will come out of this wave with more deaths.

19637,I got my vaccine in the parking lot outside a major football stadium in the US.
19638,The documentation was not very sophisticated.

19640,"The critical vaccination period was Q1, and while the EU failed to vaccinate large parts of the population in the beginning of this year, it seems like vaccine supply is a thing of the past."

19642,"For the booster shots, the EU have very good contracts with both Pfizer and Moderna."
19643,"The vaccine isn't 100% effective - it significantly reduces your chance of getting it, but if you are constantly being exposed to it by unvaccinated people, you can still get it eventually."
19644,"Also as they pointed out, the more unvaccinated people there are, the more chances there are for it to mutate into a strain that the vaccines don't work as well against."

19657,Did you ever worry about the flu doing this before?

19659,"If this is your argument, I fully expect you to never leave your house again - it's the only consistent position."
19660,Any disease *could* mutate to something that will kill you at any time.
19661,But you‚Äôre spot on.

19718,"So you getting vaccinated can still prevent deaths, even if you personally are unlikely to die from it."

19751,Why aren‚Äôt we playing to the emotions about the people who have died as a direct result of the vaccine?
19752,"Because those are few and fat in between, but so are the young covid casualties."

19815,"This figure does not include the extra 50 million will be getting from Pfizer/BioNTech in Q2, but I won't adjust the figure because it leaves room for some of the other vaccine developers to underdeliver."
19816,"For now, let's also leave aside that 55 million of those are J&amp;J which only require a single shot, and say for the sake of simplicity that the EU will have had received 460 million doses by the end of June."
19817,"The population of the EU is about 448 million, so that would be enough to give a first shot to literally everybody, including babies and vaccine sceptics."
19818,"More realistically, there are about 80 million children in the EU, which means that there are approximately 370 million adults, so the EU would have enough vaccines to have fully vaccinated 60% of adults (it would probably look something like 70% having received a first dose and 50% having received been fully vaccinated)."
19819,"If you do factor in J&amp;J being a single shot, there would be enough vaccines to fully vaccinate around 65% of the adult population."
19820,"Considering those sceptical of the vaccines, that would likely be enough to cover almost everyone who wants one."
19821,"Even if you include the time to distribute these vaccine deliveries, the EU has already committed to giving 70% of adults their first shot by [July](https://www.euronews.com/2021/04/23/eu-to-vaccinate-70-of-adults-by-july-two-months-ahead-of-schedule-says-von-der-leyen)."

19823,"The only ""well off European country"" that isn't in the EU's procurement scheme is Switzerland (aside from the UK, but I don't think anyone here has doubts about their vaccination programme), and they are also on a similar track."
19824,"The Swiss government is also aiming to give everybody who wants one a first dose by the end of [June](https://foph-coronavirus.ch/vaccination/when-can-i-be-vaccinated/), and will be able to do so using Moderna and Pfizer alone (they have also ordered 5 million from Curevac, 6 million from Novavax and 5.3 million from AZ)."

19950,Hopefully this will re-assure some of the 'but AZ is less effective' fears - the trials were never directly comparable to each other because they happened at different times and places against different variants.

20034,And so is virus exposure.
20035,Your immune system sends out identifier cells who then alert killer cells.
20036,"If the virus can accumulate sufficient quantity to evade the volume of identifier cells or killer cells, it can establish an infection."
20037,"This can happen if you are an individual with naturally lower immune response,  or if you are elderly (immune response weakens as we age), or if you are immunosuppressed."

20047,If the vaccine is causing a disease to occurs at a similar rate to how it occurs in the general population then it is very difficult to prove the vaccine is actually causing the issue.
20048,With CVST the rates are so rare low in general population that the issue with the vaccine really stuck out.

20107,"The article cites a paper that says outdoors is lower than indoors, but doesn't even quantify the absolute risk whether it's high or low, just relatively lower than indoors."

20114,"Absolutely I'm satisfied with the reduced risk, which drops to zero if you aren't within a few feet of others."
20115,There are plenty of risks when you leave your house.
20116,"Instituting wide ranging mandatory public health restrictions make sense when there is a uniform and significant risk of a specific issue, but becomes irresponsible policy when the risk is minuscule."
20117,You are more likely to die from countless issues when you leave your house than you are to catch COVID from being outside without a mask.
20118,"Focus the energy and political capitol on issues that ACTUALLY MATTER, and don't just carry a minuscule risk."
20119,All of these public health initiatives rely on the willing compliance of the majority of the public since no politician wants to be seen arresting people or issuing mass citations for not wearing your mask outside.
20120,"Be HONEST with people about the very low risk of catching COVID outdoors, and allow them to make their own decisions on masking in that setting, and use the political capitol and trust that is gained from that decision to enforce restrictions when they ACTUALLY matter."

20132,It‚Äôs a gradual slide up.
20133,"No it's statistics, not hubris."
20134,"Well, one general comment - my definitions are completely contrived."
20135,"21 days of supply of arbitrary, although it does seem to be a strong dividing line where an inflection point has been reached (days of supply typically starts to increase rapidly once you reach three weeks - implying an underlying supply/demand imbalance) - and a month ago only a handful of states were demand constrained under this definition, two weeks ago only 12 were, and now there's 29."
20136,"It seems to mirror ""reality"" in that sense that it feels right."
20137,"On Michigan specifically - when the governor asked for additional doses, that was week of April 5th."
20138,"At that time, Michigan was supply constrained under the definition above, only flipping to ""unclear"" that weekend, and only to demand constrained this weekend."
20139,So Michigan being demand constrained is a new development that wasn't true at the initial time of the ask.
20140,"Of course, my understanding is that Whitmer is still asking for additional doses as of this past week."
20141,"It's unclear whether it is because she believes they can be put to use, or if it is just posturing to save face."
20142,Only an idiot would be concerned about taking a new vaccine
20143,That's not true.
20144,"However, this sub is full of people who think public health isn't important."
20145,"If you don't care about such things, no one is going to convince you."
20146,&gt;	look at marjorie taylor greene.
20147,no one is paying her to pretend space lasers exist.
20148,I wouldn‚Äôt be so sure.
20149,"The guy running against her had his life destroyed including receiving death threats, dropped out, and she was on the ballot unopposed."
20150,Someone sure helped her.
20151,Wouldn‚Äôt be shocked to find out she‚Äôs on the payroll of some vile fucks like the Mercer klan.
20152,"If Tommy Tuberville treats his senate seat anything like he did my alma mater's football team, then I weep for the state of Alabama."
20153,"I'm curious, can you explain how?"
20154,It doesn't seem like we are getting much of the full story in this article and I'm assuming it's been covered more in the EU press than here.
20155,"Other than over-promising, what has Astrazeneca done wrong?"
20156,"Most people I know from Asia say masks are worn due to pollution, not ‚Äúflu season‚Äù."
20157,Perhaps it‚Äôs different in different countries.
20158,I'm getting so sick of Republicans.
20159,"They're the first ones to complain about mask mandates, social distancing, and lockdowns, yet so many of them refuse to do ANYTHING to actually solve the problem so that we can finally go back to normal."
20160,It breaks the contract the US has with AZ
20161,Has he quantified that low risk with actual research?
20162,"CDC demanded ""research"" on face masks in Jan/Feb/Mar of 2020, now they are lifting masks requirements because ""Obviously"" it's ""low risk""."
20163,[removed]
20164,That's not primary data.
20165,"Yeah, none of these are healthy."
20166,The healthier thing is to remove restrictions as soon as possible
20167,"First one is not bad they basically did a systematic google search, but it's not peer reviewed."
20168,They also added that the limitation of the study is that almost all gatherings will be low risk in all areas.
20169,"Meaning sure, for maybe 90% of the outdoor setting it's low risk but for the 10% like outdoor hallways, tight corners, that can be a vector for transmission."
20170,"Additionally, there is a conflict of interest since one of the authors hosts an outdoor kids event."
20171,Second study did not even have outdoor measure as a dependent variable.
20172,They just studied indoor transmission and it was in October 2020 which is an entirely different ecosystem.
20173,That's not that many studies tbh.
20174,They do benefit some from some forms of throat cancer protection
20175,"Or you know, a mask?"
20176,Two of the crappiest generations doing crappy things?
20177,"How shocking.....

&amp;#x200B;

\-Gen X"
20178,&gt;	I refuse to believe any current sitting senator is as dumb as RJ pretends to be.
20179,Have you heard Grassley speak?
20180,Canadians are the most level-headed people on the planet.
20181,How did you get stuck with this guy?
20182,People currently experiencing cold symptoms should probably be wearing a mask all the time in public anyway.
20183,"It's just during Covid those people are hopefully staying home, whereas before Covid they were probably going to work or taking public transit even with the sniffles."
20184,"No because we'd have to do it for money, power, and *vengeance*"
20185,"CDC has a pathetic record on face masks, from the very beginning, it took over 3 months to recommend cloth masks, and almost 1 year to recommend double-masking."
20186,"Now they are so urgent to remove outdoor masking, it's really pathetic."
20187,They gain voters by spouting what they want to hear...because politicians simply don‚Äôt care about anyone.
20188,They never did.
20189,"As long as they have a target and can assign fault to that target, we stay divided and they stay in power."
20190,It‚Äôs that simple.
20191,"Yeah, even without vaccines, so where‚Äôs the incentive?"
20192,Also I and my friends are vaccinated and I see on social media a bunch of people are getting vaccinated too
20193,Define ‚Äúsignificant risk‚Äù?
20194,"From what I‚Äôve seen Covid rates among the vaccinated are extraordinarily tiny, like 6k total out of hundreds of thousands of infections."
20195,With that on top of the vaccine reducing household transmission by upwards of 50% I‚Äôm just not seeing where the ‚Äúsignificant risk‚Äù you‚Äôre talking about comes from.
20196,"Vaccinated here and had Covid, give 0 fucks about Covid at this point."
20197,Already lost a year of my life so now that I have reached the end game (vaccine) why live in fear?
20198,Pointless to worry about a ‚Äúpossible‚Äù variant in the future.
20199,"With Lineage B.1.1.7, most people on the ICU are younger and stay much much longer."
20200,"They don't die that much, but they block ICU beds longer!"
20201,"Having a lot of healthcare workers in the family, they really want to not pull double shifts all the time, because the system is already overloaded as it is."
20202,Sure they are vaccinated.
20203,They wont get sick.
20204,Thats it.
20205,This seems like a great idea
20206,I think it‚Äôs important to distinguish the heroes at Oxford university that made this vaccine to help beat this pandemic all over the world on one side and AstraZeneca‚Äôs abysmal behavior on the other.
20207,"I don‚Äôt know how business is conducted where you live, but this shouldn‚Äôt really come as a surprise to AZ."
20208,"If my (non-medical) company had been equally poor at delivery, we‚Äôd be sued by our clients back in February already."
20209,What is unethical is testing human subjects with a disease that has no treatment or cure.
20210,Using people who probably didn‚Äôt get too sick doesn‚Äôt help.
20211,‚ÄúLong COVID‚Äù or longhaulers gets lasting symptoms even after mild cases.
20212,Is that worth infecting someone for?
20213,They don‚Äôt need excuses and never wore masks to begin with.
20214,They don't know the 6 people.
20215,Around 200 people will be informed and will get antigen test in 2 weeks to find the ones who didn't get the vaccine.
20216,&gt; why everything has to be red vs blue?
20217,"Yeah, good question."
20218,Why did Republicans make a virus and masks political?
20219,You have an answer for that?
20220,Is there any way we can kill Republican politicians solely for money and power?
20221,I think the point is that right now hesitant people think ‚Äúwell they tell me to get a vaccine but they also tell me I‚Äôm still at risk and still have to wear a mask.
20222,"Why would I get something that clearly does nothing‚Äù 


Sure, there are antivaxxers who you won‚Äôt convince."
20223,But there are a ton of people who just plain think it‚Äôs pointless bc Fauci still says you have to do all the same cautious things as before.
20224,"Like god damn, just yesterday fauci said ‚Äúif you are outside, and wear a mask, and are fully vaccinated, you‚Äôre pretty safe‚Äù."
20225,"Like Jesus fuck, if I read that and was hesitant about the vaccine I would literally think it does nothing."
20226,Fauci and the cdc have to get their shit together bc the fearmongering is killing vaccine enthusiasm.
20227,Damn so many meaningless deaths
20228,Better hide in your house forever!
20229,Fuck Americans for voting for it.
20230,Feingold was the best.
20231,I keep hoping he'll run for something again.
20232,"Unless peopel are pissing behind a bush or in the ocean, most outdoor gatherings will necessarily have an indoor component."
20233,Hawaii is still mandating masks outdoors.
20234,you mean the blood clots which you have a 100x more likelihood with birth control?
20235,That side-effect?
20236,How come you weirdos believe that like 5 second period of time that the CDC said that and not what they've been saying for over a year now?
20237,Just curious how you're able to do that without telling yourself that's idiotic?
20238,"OMG, who was this?"
20239,"I've seen some real stupid remarks before, but that one has to take the cake."
20240,Any follow-up in the news about the Texas Rangers allowing full capacity fans?
20241,Were there any associated outbreaks?
20242,That‚Äôs weird.
20243,I guess at least she got one and not zero.
20244,There is definitely a large amount of people who are in no rush to get the vaccine even if they also are not against it.
20245,"Hopefully as more places open to walk ins, she will just decide to do it one day soon."
20246,This was my brother in law.
20247,"He has barely left the house in a year, wears two masks and a ""Dr. Fauci Fan Club"" T-shirt everywhere he goes, but couldn't be bothered to get vaccinated."
20248,Finally after a bunch of bugging and an appointment opening around the corner from his house he got it.
20249,Except it‚Äôs very likely you‚Äôre in a situation going from indoor to outdoor quite frequently.
20250,So it‚Äôs more like.
20251,Having to wear a seatbelt at a red light if anything.
20252,My point is.
20253,The mindset of ‚ÄúI better not have to do one bit greater than the absolute min requirement at every moment.
20254,"Dispite during a global pandemic the worst of my life time, and we‚Äôre still constantly learning about the virus.‚Äù Is an extension of the mah freedumbs mindset that will keep virus around longer."
20255,Congrats to those bulls!
20256,"You will live to fight another day, literally."
20257,I get that only 1/8th of the world's population has been vaccinated which is why I'm one of the most vocal advocates for the vaccine ESPECIALLY the mRNA vaccines.
20258,"Theres been a lot of talk about these variants, but it seems like in the U.S where we have the South Africa, India, UK, and Brazil variants as our most dominant variants, the vaccine appears to be working against those in real life."
20259,"Of course you're going to have people testing positive after vaccination and possibly getting cold-like symptoms, but the billion dollar question will be how many of those vaccinated people end up so sick they're in the ICU or dying?"
20260,So far we haven't seen that happening a lot.
20261,FRJ
20262,It would be much better if we didn't enforce patents for making money *on this one thing*.
20263,"If every country were allowed to produce their own vaccine for *only next 2-3 years*, the whole world would be a better place."
20264,"Instead, we chose to be grave robbers, to increase that bottom line."
20265,Of course I got vaccinated.
20266,I want this to end.
20267,I can tell you that a lot of people especially in WI don't believe that death count.
20268,They make the argument of deaths incorrectly attributed to covid.
20269,All one needs to do is the increase in deaths during 2020.
20270,Period end of story.
20271,"You can buy ""ear protectors"" that clip them round the back."
20272,Think you can also use a safety pin.
20273,"[Here](https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/04/politics/gallery/barrett-announcement-inside-white-house-0926/index.html) are some photos of that ""outdoor"" event."
20274,"I can't link to any sources discussing the format of the event, because they get removed for being ""political,"" but I think you can see from the photos that it is (again) highly misleading to call that an outdoor event."
20275,"&gt;I‚Äôve been filling vaccinated for over a month now, but I still haven‚Äôt done anything."
20276,"I live in Iowa, where there‚Äôs nothing to do anyway."
20277,"Seems like people are just going out drinking, and that‚Äôs it."
20278,The bars have been crowded for most of the year now anyway.
20279,I don‚Äôt even drink though.
20280,"&gt;  
&gt;COVID has taken any desire out of me to ‚Äúgo out,‚Äù anyway."
20281,"All of my college friends moved away, and I still have one online course before I graduate."
20282,I‚Äôve been incredibly bored.
20283,Wish there was something to do.
20284,I feel like my life has been ruined in many regards.
20285,Maybe I should start drinking.
20286,Maybe you should get the fuck out of Iowa instead of developing a drinking problem.
20287,Dude you really need to read past the abstract.
20288,It's embarrassing.
20289,This even has a great little table that details a bunch of other studies that come to similar conclusions that you can link to.
20290,"&gt;Five studies related to SARS-CoV-2 transmission found that less than 10% of reported transmission occurred in outdoor settings, less than 5% of cases were related to outdoor occupations, and the odds of transmission or super-spreading are much lower outdoors (Table 1) [14‚Äì17]."
20291,&gt;Study 1: 2/7324 or &lt;1% of transmissions happened outdoors.
20292,&gt;Study 2: 4/103 or ~5% of transmissions happened outdoors.
20293,&gt;Study 3: Odds of indoor transmission between 6 and 20 times more likely than outdoors.
20294,&gt;Study 4: Odds of super-spreader events indoors between 4 and 290 times more likely than outdoors.
20295,"&gt;Study 5: 95/10,926 or &lt;1% of transmissions occurred outdoors."
20296,"This study simply says there are gaps in the research that need to be filled in, but admits that based on evidence from past influenza outbreaks and virus behavior that these systemic studies are in line with what they expect to see."
20297,"I'm all for wearing masks indoors, I expect that to happen into next year and I have no problem with that."
20298,"However putting in place nonsensical regulations like mandatory outdoor masking is NONSENSE based on the risk assessment, and makes people more hesitant to follow any kind of restriction at all."
20299,"The distrust came from a massive republican disinformation campaign, that is still continuing to this day."
20300,Don‚Äôt fall for it!
20301,Personally - as an American I *love* visiting Newfoundland.
20302,You can truly get off the beaten path and run into very few tourists (only other Canadians!).
20303,I look forward to the day they reopen the borders so we can visit the big land again!
20304,Definitely if we can get the shots in arms that will help!
20305,Americans being Americans we might be starting to get down to the carrot/stick point to get them in there though.
20306,The enthusiastic folks have gotten theirs I think.

20315,The public needs to have science explained to them in layman's terms.
20316,"They need to have the big picture, and perspective."
20317,"News will grab things like ""7,000 vaccinated persons were infected with the virus"" and they are left to think ""wow, this thing doesnt even work!?"""
20318,The news needs to put this in perspective by saying this number is less than 1% of total vaccinated persons.
20319,The scare with AstraZeneca needs to be put into perspective with how many women suffer blood clots from birth control (and the relative ease with which people accept risks here).
20320,People are not very science literate.
20321,I really hope the CDC and other world health organizations can communicate these things to the media.
20322,Good for you!
20323,Here in Romania we only got around 4.6 million doses administered and the waiting lists are spent.
20324,The desire for vaccination is not as high as it could be
20325,For most people that wasn‚Äôt ever a serious concern.
20326,I've already consistently seen people exclaim that the EU will lose.
20327,it's pretty low even if you aren't vaccinated
20328,Haaaaave you met Ted?
20329,Send vaccines or relinquish the patents.
20330,Typical American hubris.
20331,"Cant possibly lose money, or cost our pharma overlords money."
20332,"I‚Äôm all about the vaccines, and the scientists who developed them."
20333,But for fucks sake help save the world and end this insanity you monsters.
20334,Why do you guys hate science so much?
20335,Ya verbiage on reddit can get you sometimes thats why I hate texting over quick phone calls irl lol
20336,"Yep, I have yet to read any negative information about the varents and the mrna vaccines."
20337,"Yes some varents can have break through infections, but it's a pretty low amount and most people have mild infections."
20338,"There are some serous breakthrough infections and a few deaths I have read about, but it's much more in line with the flu, if not less."

20348,He needs to get the extremists out to vote in 2022.
20349,Not sure if you have already booked flights - but you *can* transit through Canada you just can‚Äôt officially enter.
20350,I get my second shot about a week from now and I feel giddy but also hesitant to do activities finally outside of my house like the movies or a restaurant.
20351,"To-go style for restaurants has just been so trash compared to sitting down, but it‚Äôs just common sense to probably not go to a restaurant indoors."
20352,"Mentally, I even feel this way towards outdoor restaurants even if all the science is there saying it‚Äôs ok. That common sense also arises with indoor movie theaters, but I bet I could have found some drive in theaters just like Biden had those drive in speeches before the election."
20353,half are asymptomatic
20354,That doesn't quite hold in Thailand where it is very possible to be in close proximity to other people for extended periods of time outdoors - think street markets
20355,"So, the narrative in the past was that it was all political faff from the EU and if they'd had a case they'd have gone to court."
20356,Now I guess it'll be yeah but they're just doing it to save face and they'll lose.
20357,Exactly how I felt after getting my first dose in January!
20358,Best place to learn more - Talk to your physician or medical care provider if you have questions about the vaccine.
20359,Evonik also made the poison gas used in the holocaust.
20360,But they should be trackable via batch number and it's not like the nurse has spent the past month deliberately botching thousands of vaccinations.
20361,"Been vaccinated for about a month, and while I still get nervous in some settings, I‚Äôve been seeing people semi regularly, going to the movies, and eating indoors!"
20362,"My uncle who got vaccinated with J&amp;J just tested positive, and I saw him the day before his test outdoors, so if I wasn‚Äôt vaccinated, I think I would be freaking out wayyyyy more."
20363,Getting the shot took a massive weight off my shoulders regardless!
20364,Ya this is basically what I‚Äôve gathered as well.
20365,I haven‚Äôt had covid (as far as I know) and I will be 9 days post second moderna shot this Saturday where I was invited to a gathering.
20366,"I‚Äôve had to so no so many times to friends this year so I want to go so bad but I also feel so close to the finish line, I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs an unnecessary risk."
20367,The second shot kicked my ass on Thursday so I at least know I had an immune response lol
20368,Sorry to hear that.
20369,There‚Äôs nothing you can do once it‚Äôs in the family
20370,Ron Johnson is a sneaky piece of shit and has been since he entered politics.
20371,"He forced out long time, very successful and well liked, senator russ feingold."
20372,"He was the only senator to vote against the original patriot act, as well as one of the few opposing the iraq war."
20373,"Johnson's whole campaign was alibg the lines of, ""The country's deficit went up by trillions of dollars while Russ feingold was in office."
20374,"Do you want to vote for that kind of leadership?"""
20375,"Of course, feingold also voted against the simultaneous wars and tax cuts that forced the deficit up."
20376,"Johnson had always been a lying crapsack, from day one."
20377,Nothing he says should be trusted a being truthful.
20378,"He could tell me the sun will rise in the east tomorrow, and I'd be there at dawn to make sure he hadn't fucked something up."
20379,"This comment seems like where the US is today, unfortunately."
20380,Some of us just want to shove our fingers in our ears and pretend everything‚Äôs fine.
20381,"&gt; ‚Äúsigh, can‚Äôt we all just get along?‚Äù"
20382,We never did in Georgia.
20383,And the governor tried to sue our largest city when it tried to enact one.
20384,You'd be pretty safe.
20385,"While it's technically still possible to transmit it even if you're vaccinated, the risk of it is very small."
20386,Vaccines work incredibly well and studies are starting to prove they significantly reduce transmission as well as infection.
20387,Go see your friends and have fun.
20388,[removed]
20389,Oh did I say stay at home?
20390,Not work and lose your wages?
20391,Mask wearing is especially protecting those people who had to go out and work.
20392,Or me when I have to go the hospital and hope I don't get infected.
20393,And I absolutely agree that they were wrong in not prescribing masks sooner for fear of lack of PPE.
20394,And I certainly will push for CDC to hold them accountable for that.
20395,"But it doesn't change the fact that till vaccinations have reached a certain threshold, masks are useful and a very simple measure."
20396,Only ones who don't want to wear it and make a fuss about are people who are inconvenienced.
20397,What about the White House Rose Garden super spreader event?
20398,"A lot of people seem to have quickly forgotten that part of the issue early in the pandemic was not just the virus, but our infrastructure to support it."
20399,"Hospitals in many places were overcrowded, and that‚Äôs where ‚Äúflatten the curve‚Äù came from."
20400,"At a minimum, while someone could still get it, it‚Äôs partially to lower its intensity so that those who do have severe cases can be treated without hospitals being overwhelmed."
20401,"That‚Äôs not to say we haven‚Äôt learned a lot about it‚Äôs treatment since the beginning, and treatment results are generally getting better from my understanding, but I‚Äôve seen fewer and fewer people seem to remember that keeping hospitalizations down was part of the value of being vaccinated."
20402,Glasses fogging up and my peripheral vision being blocked are still huge issues for me.
20403,"Yes, and even NPR had a physician on the other day saying he thought the outdoor mask mandate was going too far."
20404,"Ah okay, that makes sense."
20405,But it does greatly reduce the spread.
20406,"If enough people get it and the R0 value can be brought below 1, cases will eventually become much less common."
20407,That's happening in Israel right now (60% vaccinated and only 50 reported cases yesterday).

20417,It‚Äôs out of pure laziness.
20418,"She told me multiple people have made appointments on her behalf, but she just didn‚Äôt go."
20419,She blamed it on having to work or something else.

One says the number (6 clots), the other says ""rare"" and the third even says ""extremely rare""."
20567,And they're all simply reporting the fact that the CDC itself paused it.
20568,Not a single headline even mentioned death.
20569,"Seriously, the media has many faults, but it was the pause itself - and not the coverage of it - that has caused this hesitancy."
20570,They say it's less than a 2% death rate.
20571,Idiots
20572,Hadn't considered that and it makes sense.

20574,yeah I was just pointing how Republicans think its always worse than it seems elsewhere but better than it seems here.
20575,There is a window that it‚Äôs very unlikely to have side effects.

20587,"Of course if they're not feeling well, I'd hold off, but I don't see a lot of reasons to do much."

20704,"Obviously, everyone is entitled to do whatever they want (or not) to their own body."

20714,Just keep it up!
20715,Our governor has tried to do all of that.
20716,Republicans have fought her every step of the way.
20717,Small towns have basically been doing what they want.
20718,"Some of the bigger cities have kept mask mandates up, which has been good."
20719,"Well I haven't had any time off during the pandemic so let me lend an assist in saying that it's a paper facemask, you'll live."
20720,Exactly.....
20721,"This is the core issue of democracy in an uneducated nation....

A vote of an uneducated person = A vote of an educated person......

All lives are important, but they need to have some common sense and education before their opinions become worthy for a vote."
20722,Probably has nothing to do with vaccinations rolling out
20723,"Agreed, this is by far not new information, only reason i posted it is because it's recent."
20724,Why should it ever be lifted then?
20725,How do you explain the [Novavax vaccine trial ](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-covid-19-vaccine-demonstrates-893-efficacy-uk-phase-3)results?
20726,"From UK to the South African variant, efficacy dropped from 90% to about 60% efficacy."
20727,"That's certainly not 0% effective like I've seen a few headlines claim, but it's a rather concerning drop in effectiveness IMO."
20728,That keeps confusing people on here.
20729,What that means is that studies of outdoor transmissions don't tend to give all the details like indoor ones.
20730,"The number of people around, time spent, distances, etc."
20731,And it makes sense because it is more difficult.
20732,Indoor transmissions can be more easily reconstructed and described.
20733,"For example, it is easier to show what direction and force the air was flowing from an indoor air conditioner than the wind outside at an exact moment."
20734,So the details of outdoor transmissions are less exact and messier.
20735,And so therefore is our knowledge about how things like distance influence transmissions outdoors.
20736,There are fewer papers detailing the settings.
20737,I'm fully vaccinated and hoping to travel to Italy and Greece in September.
20738,Any reason why I should be concerned that this may fall through?
20739,"I saw the EU just announced they will open up to vaccinated people from the US over the summer, and I'll be heading there months after summer."
20740,I'd imagine both Italy and Greece will have vaccinated much more of their population by then and it won't be a concern for us or them.
20741,&gt; Instead of Biden giving tax credits for offices to give workers time off to get the vaccine (which aren‚Äôt being super widely adopted) why not open some 24hr walk in sites?
20742,Why not both?
20743,Kind of silly at this stage since the were only at about 30% of the population that got vaccinated.
20744,Especially with the all of the anti maskers and antivacers will say they are vacillated anyway to skirt the guidelines.
20745,The county of freedom built by slaves.
20746,Your knowledge is a joke.
20747,"I mean, that does seem to be what they're saying, no?"
20748,I have to imagine that a lot of these counties are already at herd immunity from getting the virus.
20749,My in laws live in western Kansas and nearly 50% of the town has tested positive.
20750,"Factoring in the people who weren‚Äôt tested, I have to imagine the real number is as close to 100% as you could possibly get."
20751,No then it will be something new.
20752,I propose ‚ÄûVollbremsungs-lockdown‚Äú because of the then introduced mutants from idk where from.
20753,"I would say the local news frames it more like:

[More vaccine sites halt Johnson &amp; Johnson shots after adverse reactions ](https://fox8.com/news/coronavirus/more-vaccine-sites-halt-johnson-johnson-shots-after-adverse-reactions/)

Which is more than enough to make people go ""SEE, I am smart to wait""."
20754,Words like 'rare' and 'extremely rare' might as well not even be in the headline as people have no idea how to contextualize that.
20755,If the media was interested in doing good they'd emphasize the intense scrutiny these vaccines go through even after they are released and would have been doing so for months.
20756,"But that doesn't gets clicks like ""J&amp;J under review"" or ""George joins other states in stopping J&amp;J shots"""
20757,"Iowa has a much lower death rate than my state, despite my state supposedly taking it much more seriously."
20758,How do you think I feel?
20759,"I'm at least mature enough not to blame the awful losses I've experienced over the past year on a whole fucking state, or to paint the people in any one place with a broad brush."
20760,"Yeah, I get that."
20761,"At some point though, we are going to have to just trust people."
20762,If the vaccine has been available for 60 days and people haven‚Äôt gotten it...that‚Äôs on them.

20768,"Hell is frequently described as the absence of reason, and nothing personifies that better than someone walking on a deserted beach or street with a mask on."
20769,Syringes are also scarce currently.
20770,They also would have to demonstrate that the vaccine is stable and storable in the syringes.
20771,"It may seem like nothing, but plastic touching your product vs glass can be a big difference."
20772,Even the surface area to volume ratio of your product in the same type of container matters.
20773,"For example, a product I worked on could not be stored in small volume plastic bags (think iv bags)."
20774,But could in large plastic bags (think pillow sizeish).
20775,"It just had to do with how much surface area we were touching, impacted the stability of the product."
20776,You saw a bit of this with FDA having to allow Moderna/pfizer to fill the vials more.
20777,Behind the scenes they had to test to make sure the stability wasn't changed.
20778,I wouldn't call us dodgers.

20784,And nothing wrong with eating moderate amounts of red meat.
20785,It‚Äôs time to start giving incentives for getting the vaccine.
20786,"Vaccines are a few days worth of annoyance (scheduling an appointment, going, sore arm, flu-like symptoms), an annoyance that isn‚Äôt worth it for a ton of young people."

20803,Now consider also lifting the damn export ban on the other vaccines.

20820,"Like, ""Look at that idiot wearing masks outdoors for no reason!"
20821,"I don't wanna be like him, let me just never wear a mask."""
20822,"Obviously that's flawed thinking, but that doesn't change the fact that it's how many people thought, and those who were overly strict about masking probably inadvertently contributed to anti-mask sentiment."
20823,Reverse psychology is a heck of a drug.
20824,Sorry to see you're getting downvoted.
20825,"As you said, masks are still relevant until we finally get the virus under control."
20826,"In the U.S. we're still having about 750 covid deaths per day or 274k deaths per year even with widespread vaccinations, so we need other precautions a little while longer to eradicate the damn virus."
20827,"I get that everyone's tired of all this, but it's partly our lackadaisical approach to ""non pharmaceutical interventions"" that keeps us from getting to the finish line."
20828,"Well, China *is* lying, but it doesn't have *millions* of deaths."
20829,Will these vaccinations be available to non citizen aliens with a residence permit in Germany?

20858,They could also point out when it can get approved....they do that for other drugs
20859,"when the country reaches herd immunity, we can definitely export"
20860,Of the remaining 50% a sizeable amount have already had covid.
20861,That is in fact the reason for a lot of the hesitancy (I personally think still getting the vaccine is good).
20862,"By the time 50% of people are ""fully vaccinated"" due to previous immunity in the population we'll likely have death rates at or below influenza levels in the US from covid."
20863,And at that point this is over.
20864,Two stories: I read of a man who bought an oxygen tank for his daughter just to keep her alive a little bit longer and then drove all around the city to find a hospital that had space for her.
20865,She died in the car.
20866,"Then today I heard that there's a new health problem coming: people are being taken to a hospital, which has no space, and so they are dying in unfeasible numbers just outside the hospital, and the dead bodies can't be taken to funeral parlors/crematoria, whatever, because they're already full."
20867,This.
20868,"The unfortunate thing is that a free jab is only half the equation, it sadly also needs to be ""convenient"" for people to consider getting it."
20869,"Drive all the way out to some mega site, or simply pop in to the local pharmacy department while doing some shopping."
20870,I don't know anything about vaccine production and distribution generally.
20871,What about pre-filled disposable syringes?
20872,That's how my flu shot this year was packaged.
20873,That seems ideal from an administration logistics perspective.
20874,"If it‚Äôs 30% accuracy just assume the opposite of the test result is correct and voila, 70% accuracy."
20875,I have this dude that came back into my life and I was having fun with him but then when I mentioned I was getting my vaccine he like scolded me and said it would kill me.
20876,Then went on to show me badly edited Facebook videos and told me about how he never vaccinated his kids because one person who knew had two kids with autism so obviously it was the vaccinations that did it.
20877,I‚Äôm uh.... not really talking to him anymore
20878,I'm not used to seeing my state (Missouri) follow scientific guidance and do something quickly.
20879,Hopefully there are people still willing to get the vaccine and we can improve on our lagging vaccine rollout
20880,Yup.
20881,And I do.
20882,As explained.
20883,"I mean, just look at global warming, we are dumb fucks."
20884,"&gt; I‚Äôm not taking the covid vaccine and it‚Äôs because of pushy fucks like you

If this is the only reason you're not getting the vaccine, that's just kinda fucking sad."
20885,Where's his evidence?
20886,"Tell him to hand it over so that you can learn the truth, then tear it to shreds and show him exactly what's wrong with it and why he's a gigantic sucker for falling for it in the first place."
20887,"China, sure (if we trust their number."
20888,I really have no idea how reliable they are).
20889,But the US?
20890,Numbers in the US are currently around the levels they were during the peak of last summer and they've been around there for over two months.
20891,They don't seem to be going down.
20892,"Here's the math, assuming the current rate of problems holds true."
20893,It currently has a less than one in a million chance of the clotting issue.
20894,"*If* every person in America got the J&amp;J vaccine (they won't), and *if* every person who had the issue actually died (they won't), that would amount to less than 330 people."
20895,"Compared to more than 550,000 dead from the disease the vaccine prevents against."
20896,"Uh I don't think so lol, that depends on the employer maybe"
20897,It‚Äôs one thing to have restrictions in a population that mixes vaccinated and unvaccinated.
20898,"In a 100% vaccinated (or close to it) population, any form of restrictions besides maybe testing and cleaning is just pure insanity with no scientific basis"
20899,"the main hurdle right now is full BLA authorization for Pfizer and Moderna so that huge organizations like police, fire, military, healthcare &amp; other union-type operations can require the shots as part of their vaccination requirements."
20900,Right now it's optional because these vaccines are still classified as Emergency Use.
20901,"The hard truth is that there's a good 30 to 35% that will not take the vaccine at all because of their ""political"" viewpoints."
20902,India - April 2021 disagrees.
20903,"Political rallies, river bathing religious festivals, etc."
20904,It's selfishness.
20905,My bad I actually replied to the wrong person here
20906,It didn't kill anyone.
20907,"Those women are in the correct demographic for increased blood clots, it could have simply been coincidence, and very likely was."
20908,It's your same argument about co-morbidities.
20909,"But if you happen to be a women of childbearing age, take the Pfizer vaccine if it will make you feel better."

20922,15/10 would do it again.
20923,Shaming didn't work for masks lol
20924,Apparently not since flights are still going.
20925,We need to pause them until people are vaccinated and cases to drop to single digits.
20926,No one says stop them indefinitely.

20928,I accidentally left my vaccine card at home when I went in for my second shot.

20983,"I went to a Rockies game, where they made multiple announcements that masks were required at all times."

20985,redditors skew introverted and many have decided that we should all be subjected to these restrictions so they feel better being shut-ins- to the point where they are now the science-deniers regarding vaccine effectiveness.
20986,This is not how the real world is functioning.
20987,It made me feel much better.
20988,"You don't think that people wearing masks which literally prevents the flu, together with social distancing, improved hand-washing and no ability to gather in groups would not completely stop the spread of flu?"
20989,I mean that's pretty damn obvious.
20990,We've done a great job stopping covid spread and that is orders of magnitude more contagious than the flu.
20991,I read a great analogy.
20992,There's a big field that is filled with goats.
20993,There are coyotes around.
20994,Every now and again they'll come in and grab the occasional goat.
20995,"No big deal, the farmer is used to it."
20996,Then one day the wolves arrive and day 1 they swoop in and obliterate loads of goats.
20997,"The farmer goes fuck this, and builds a big-ass fence around the goats."
20998,Now because wolves are really big some of them can leap the fence so he loses the occasional goat.
20999,But guess what?
21000,None of the coyotes can leap the fence so there are now ZERO coyote-related goat deaths....
21001,I've been no-contact with your family as long as I can remember.
21002,It seems fine so far.
21003,Try not to stress about it too much.
21004,another example of people not being able to partake in consensual medical procedures/test.
21005,how was that difficult for you?
21006,"If we can't contain the pandemic, I don't believe the right action is to ignore it."
21007,States should enforce mask mandates until we get the pandemic under control and/or areas can vaccinate enough people.
21008,"Some states and locations are choosing not to, and that's not good - but that doesn't mean every where else should just give up."
21009,Even in the areas with good vaccination policies we aren't yet at a level of herd immunity and masks are still useful to get case counts lower.
21010,But we're close to the point where they won't be needed to achieve that.
21011,I don't see why we need to give up because other people already have.
21012,"I have gotten a few tourbillons, but usually it's just images of someone *elses* tourbillon."
21013,I've yet to be sent a personal tourbillon.
21014,Maybe some day!
21015,Why is it silly?
21016,Outdoor transmission isn't a driver of covid cases at all.
21017,"Even if the vaccine use was put on hold and its reputation trashed, the EU still placed an order."
21018,People that are in the limelight tend to like to remain in the limelight in any way possible.
21019,Actually a graph the other day said car accidents are up.
21020,"The effect is not related to this at all but next time you hear someone say ""car accidents are down"" you might want to ask about their source on that"
21021,So a highly effective vaccine should just be compared to abrooken controller?
21022,"Yes, it have some issues, but in high risk countries or countries where it is the only available vaccine it's an absolutely no brainer and will be a game changer."
21023,"Seatbelts don't kill, they're just sometimes not effective enough to save somebody."
21024,Which is already the case with vaccines.
21025,They aren't 100% effective.
21026,"However, if 1 particular brand of seatbelts had a 1/100000 chance to wrap around the wearers neck and strangle them because of a defect of how the seatbelt was made, I would say yes, ban that brand of seatbelt."
21027,And then install seatbelts without that issue.

21032,All while sounding like a spoiled four year old that didnt get the toy they wanted.

21039,"I'm also thinking that the longer this drags on, the more anti-restrictions the world will become."
21040,"So I suppose it's possible a variant arises that starts to spread, but are these countries wiling to destroy their livelihoods even more than they already had to try and hide from the virus?"
21041,"I'm feeling optimistic as well, so hopefully it works out for both of us!"
21042,"What was the gist of the ""study""?"
21043,"I'll see them, but my young son isn't going anywhere near them until he's vaccinated."
21044,Whatever antimasker.
21045,It could last until the end of June but it won't.
21046,Cases will go down a lot in the second half of May.
21047,"Not that I take the side of these people, but when considering suicides and other mental-health induced deaths, locking down last March and imposing restrictions for over a year in most states was the worst thing we could‚Äôve done for mental health."
21048,"Seriously, screw these people."
21049,8 people I knew died last year.
21050,My husband and I lost both our grandmas and he lost his mom.
21051,"While only 2 were confirmed COVID, I can say I‚Äôve NEVER known this many family members to pass away in one year."
21052,Most of them in their 60s.
21053,My family is vaccinated and we were in total isolation for a freaking year and it was worth every minute to keep our families and other families safe.
21054,"Demonstrably false, and don't ever, ever, ever again rely on your ability to ""recall"" something."
21055,Look it up from the source itself from now until the day you die in order to prevent the spread of misinformation.

21063,"If you can‚Äôt administer your doses fast enough, why would you let the surplus pile up, doing no good for months when the doses could be sent elsewhere to alleviate pressure on EU exports, allowing everyone else to get back up and running faster."
21064,"America‚Äôs issue now is finding enough arms to jab, not producing doses."
21065,"It will hit herd immunity just as quickly whether you export doses or not, but exporting could help others and prevent possibly millions of deaths."
21066,"You won‚Äôt suddenly slow down your production either, since the US production supply lines are entirely within the US, so there won‚Äôt be any unexpected hitches is production."
21067,It‚Äôs proof of vaccination.
21068,"Why so many are doing this is beyond me, it‚Äôs not helping 

Nor is it needed, the chances of a variant popping up that escapes the vaccine are way to low to be hyping up as many are doing

Why are they doing it?"
21069,What‚Äôs the point?
21070,Person after person keeps getting confused by that.
21071,That's not saying that it is rare.
21072,It's talking about lack of details about the infections.
21073,What that means is that studies of outdoor transmissions don't tend to give all the details like indoor ones.
21074,"The number of people around, time spent, distances, etc."
21075,Indoor environments tend to be more controlled environments.
21076,"For instance, like this:

[https://www.foxla.com/news/person-caught-covid-19-after-5-minutes-in-restaurant-20-feet-from-infected-patron-researchers-say](https://www.foxla.com/news/person-caught-covid-19-after-5-minutes-in-restaurant-20-feet-from-infected-patron-researchers-say)

&gt;Person caught COVID-19 after 5 minutes in restaurant 20 feet from infected patron, researchers say

And it makes sense because it is more difficult."
21077,Indoor transmissions can be more easily reconstructed and described.
21078,"For example, it is easier to show what direction and force the air was flowing from an indoor air conditioner than the wind outside at an exact moment."
21079,So the details of outdoor transmissions are less exact and messier.
21080,And so therefore is our knowledge about how things like distance influence transmissions outdoors.
21081,There are fewer papers detailing the settings.
21082,"So in other words, the information has not been released for you to answer my question, but you're going to try to answer an unrelated question from 13 fucking years ago, just to try and prove your point."
21083,"Yeah, if they're still doing the same shit in 2021 with these vaccines, that's a problem."
21084,But you should absolutely not be assuming they are doing that just because it was done in the past with other vaccines.
21085,"If you think I'm splitting hairs here, consider that a vaccine hesitant person, or someone on the fence about getting the vaccine, would probably be less likely to get the vaccine after reading your comments on this thread."
21086,This stuff causes real damage.
21087,[removed]
21088,I think it was last Monday 4/19 that all states were open in terms of eligibility.
21089,So your idea is that everything should be open by or around June 19?

21092,"Good to know, but the pharmacy employee told this guy it‚Äôs not possible."
21093,I guess she has been given misinformation.

21102,"I'm booking a trip to Italy, Slovenia, and the Netherlands for October and feeling very optimistic about it!"
21103,"In fairness, so did a lot of governments; and I'm not just taking an easy swipe at the previous American administration."
21104,The fact of the matter is that very few people actually did take this seriously prior to March of last year.
21105,TIL Tamiflu is an antiviral!

21110,The math that these deniers fart out is simply amazing.
21111,"Realistically, these people don't even know how to interpret a graph."
21112,The people arguing about statistics like these don't have a grasp of math beyond 3rd grade.
21113,"Additionally, Health literacy in general is extremely poor in the USA, across all ages and ethnicities."
21114,When you are illiterate you are more inclined to mistrust and substitute your own reality for what's going on around you.
21115,Yay!
21116,That‚Äôs great news.
21117,The vaccines they loaned Canada helped a great deal.
21118,I‚Äôm hoping these vaccines can make a dent in the efforts in some poorer nations.
21119,I‚Äôm excited for when this is all over and I can finally visit our southern neighbour.

21129,"Because as with all the other vaccines, (ones that have actually been approved for use), they've protected at 100% against severe disease and hospitalization."
21130,It's critically important not to fall into the trap of reading efficacy percentages and seeing excerpts talking about decreased antibody response because that's not the body's only mechanism to protect itself.
21131,"The discussion of T cells has been all but absent in many news articles, and yet it's at least as important as the antibody discussion."
21132,"There's a reason why countries with high rates of vaccinations are still seeing all the metrics start to drop, because the vaccines work."
21133,Even as more and more variants emerge.

21165,"You are every bit as bad as the anti-maskers, and pretending that the comments here are fine just cause they're not EXPLICITLY anti-vaxx (even though they would strongly turn off anyone on the fence), is either willful ignorance or a complete lack of reading comprehension."

21324,"Any time someone mentions ""unknown long term effects"" I always ask them when has there ever been a vaccine where this has happened."

21347,I refuse to believe any current sitting senator is as dumb as RJ pretends to be.
21348,The fake suspicion of science and questioning the best doctors in the world is a Faustian deal with the devil to keep us divided with the hope that people vote R.  Fuck this party and these snake republicans for killing people solely for money and power.
21349,Vaccines of this nature don't really have long term side effects.
21350,"Unlike other vaccines, there isn‚Äôt any Covid (killed/attenuated) in this vaccine."
21351,"All you have is mRNA, which are instructions to make a protein."
21352,"In this case, this is the spike protein."
21353,"Normally mRNA is made in the nucleus and goes out to the ribosomes where proteins are made, and then the mRNA is degraded."
21354,Here we are just bringing the mRNA to the ribosome from outside.
21355,"mRNA doesn‚Äôt have the capability of entering the nucleus and making changes to the DNA, where there would be potential to do damage."
21356,mRNA is super unstable and degrades really quickly (in a matter of hours).
21357,"That‚Äôs why the Pfizer vaccine has to be held at such a low temperature, because otherwise the mRNA would degrade and be ineffective."
21358,That short time window + the lack of its ability to enter the nucleus really rules out any risk of significant side effects outside of allergic reactions.
21359,I'm fully vaccinated and pregnant.
21360,I understand you completely.
21361,I'm also just as diligent pre-vaccinated as I am post-vaccinated.
21362,You want me to get vaccinated?
21363,"Ok, done."
21364,You want me to still wear a mask after being fully vaccinated.....nah.
21365,Ok but then people can simply say you need to wear a mask and have a negative test if you don‚Äôt wish to provide proof of vaccination.
21366,I think we're talking at crossed purposes.
21367,One assumes that the reason this is being reported and studied is because researchers suspect there *may* an increased incidence of myocarditis in the vaccinated population.
21368,"Of course they need to nail that down, and the fact that myocarditis is common(-ish) suggests that it *might* just be coincidence."
21369,The current data seems to be equivocal opn that respect.
21370,"But I hope you would agree that they do need to establish whether the incidence of myocarditis in vaccinated people is higher than in unvaccinated people, and if so by how much."
21371,"They shouldn't just be saying ""Oh well, myocarditis is quite common, we don't need to worry about this""."
21372,I'm still wondering how this is possible.
21373,How many people there do you think we're vaccinated?
21374,So what‚Äôs your plan?

21385,Most people I knew went from being worried sick to giving up within a week.

21387,Israel had fully vaccinated 55% of people by April 1.

21389,Deaths in UAE are lower than Israel so thats a good sign too.
21390,Fauci is a lying crook
21391,"Well, apparently, these days, science needs as much help as it can get, unfortunately."
21392,Thanks.
21393,I don't see the issue with someone taking a learned idea (that masks block respiratory droplets and make you less likely to get sick in general) and applying it to their own lives (i.e.
21394,not advocating mandates on anyone else)
21395,"&gt; If you are fully vaccinated, your chances of catching COVID are .006%."
21396,The chance changes based on stuff like community spread and what actions you are taking.
21397,"It is NOT a static, universal number."
21398,Do you think that it would be safe for me to see people who are fully vaccinated in say July?
21399,Does this vaccine prevent the COVID from being spread?

21433,The FDA literally approved the use of these vaccines.

21435,"I mean to be fair the CDC does have an agenda... 

To reduce sickness and save lives."
21436,"A very simple example I‚Äôll provide, and that will be the last thing, is about antibiotic resistant bacteria."
21437,"Yes I know bacteria are not viruses, but under pressure they are forced to mutate to become more not less deadly."
21438,Also over sanitizing in hospitals has lead to the creating of super-bacteria which is a real problem for hospitals now.
21439,Some scientists have been promoting letting covid run rampant in the younger population to mutate it to become more contagious but less deadly.
21440,This is not so crazy considering what we have observed historically.

21449,But the gist is people that are senators come from all different backgrounds.

21454,"Half the world has had massive coronavirus outbreaks that have killed enormous numbers of people, and yet in every one of the countries involved, there are people who talk as if their country would have been magically immune to the virus (or to a second wave of it) if it weren't for one individual or group."
21455,"It's indicative or arrogant, exceptionalist attitudes."

21509,"An Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) is a mechanism to facilitate the availability and use of medical countermeasures, including vaccines, during public health emergencies, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic."
21510,"Under an EUA, FDA may allow the use of unapproved medical products, or unapproved uses of approved medical products in an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions when certain statutory criteria have been met, including that there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives."
21511,"Taking into consideration input from the FDA, manufacturers decide whether and when to submit an EUA request to FDA."
21512,"Once submitted, FDA will evaluate an EUA request and determine whether the relevant statutory criteria are met, taking into account the totality of the scientific evidence about the vaccine that is available to FDA."
21513,"https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/emergency-use-authorization-vaccines-explained 

Like I said, pipe down before you sink

Edit: in case you missed it key-word = unapproved."
21514,Seems like the only thing you‚Äôre familiar with is delusion.
21515,You gonna spout out anymore nonsense?
21516,"When you say EU leaders, I hope you realize it's actually singular."
21517,"I'm so sorry that one individual, the leader of a nation first place in anti-vax said something dumb."
21518,Doesn't change all the other nations in the EU who are consistently using up every single AZ dose it receives.
21519,"Those doses in Italy which were not declared anywhere, and was promptly investigated?"
21520,"Besides the fact that no, not all of those were bound for the EU and were bound for Covax actually."
21521,I don't find it strange that the absolutely woeful communication from AZ (Who have changed every delivery amount every week and have now cancelled this weeks delivery suddenly) to entail investigation into a warehouse filled to the brim with AZ doses.
21522,AZ have done so much wrong on so many levels it's unreal how you can actually lick a massive pharmaceuticals company's boots when it fails to deliver over 100m doses of life saving vaccines.
21523,the end of the story has long passed for deniers of facts.
21524,"it's just that they didn't realize it, and don't care."
21525,"You‚Äôre concentrating on the wrong issues, like proving me wrong."

21613,"Fyi, The spike protein made by the body after vaccination differs from the viral spike protein in just two of the 1259 amino acids."
21614,The engineered sequence substitutes two amino acids‚Äîboth prolines‚Äîfor amino acids in the viral spikes.
21615,Why?
21616,"Because it was known from previous work that these prolines stabilize the spike protein, keeping it from folding up."
21617,It thus retains the same shape it has in the native virus.
21618,"In other words, it's the same spike protein."

21634,"So in the years where there are slight dips in deaths from prior years, is the most likely cause a weaker than average flu strain that year?"
21635,That isn't really an accurate title either.
21636,"I do wish, though, that they'd inform us of how many cases aren't traced at all."
21637,"Like, it's not really useful to know that 0.1% of cases are **traced** to outdoor events if you don't know how many cases total are traced."

21665,"&gt;note that this means that if you vaccinate 100 people with it, 5 people will catch it, not that all 100 people individually only have a 5% chance of catching it


This isn't quite right."
21666,95% efficacy means a 95% reduction in chance of getting it.
21667,"So if you are in a situation where 100% of unvaccinated people would get sick, in that case you have a 5% chance of getting it."
21668,In normal situations it's much lower.
21669,"""Emergent BioSolutions, a U.S. company, runs a facility near the University of Manitoba campus."

21698,"Moreover, as covid continues to spread worldwide, the virus mutates."
21699,There is cause for concern that the virus will mutate in a way to avoid the vaccine immune response.
21700,"In this case, if a vaccinated person is not wearing a mask then they are putting themselves and others at risk for infection."
21701,"When the world wide covid cases get under control and mutations cease or slow down, then it will be more appropriate to stop wearing masks in public places."

21716,Most people arent fully vaccinated yet in Canada.
21717,Being half vaccinated doesnt mean you cant get infected yet or spread it.
21718,Hence why the restrictions on travel and quarantine after travel is still on.
21719,Besides in parts of the country like GTA you arent supposed to have visitors or people behind the people you live with visiting your house.
21720,They should avoid taking NSAIDs like Ibuprofen if they can manage it.
21721,"NSAIDs are anti-inflammatory, and the inflammation is one of the immune system responses that the vaccine is trying to generate."
21722,Some previous studies with other vaccines suggest that NSAIDs could slightly reduce the efficacy of the vaccination.
21723,Aceitominophen (i.e.
21724,"Tylenol) is not an NSAID, though, so that should be okay."
21725,That's what I took after my second Moderna.

21730,Unforeseeable delays or outright malice in padding?
21731,I'm being told they've been evil.
21732,I understand frustration with someone under delivering but it's not really intrinsically a function of them being evil.
21733,I know they had production delays in the US because of contamition at a plant there of J&amp;J vaccines coming out of the same facility.
21734,I also know that India seized a while bunch of vaccines produced there because they wanted them.
21735,European production coming out of the UK may have been subject to some strong arming too.
21736,Perhaps it was foreseeable that countries would not permit vaccine made within their borders to be exported and they are at fault.
21737,"Excluding that issues, I have no idea how much shortfall remains or what accounts for it."
21738,I assumed perhaps there has been more of a blow by blow accounting in the EU press that was perhaps more damning.
21739,I'm by no means letting AZ off the hook here because I don't have all the numbers or details but the delays I'm aware of all seem like things AZ would have struggled to predict and were out of their control.
21740,There may be several others that they should have anticipated or perhaps they simply lied about their overall capacity (i.e.
21741,they'd still be significantly short without seizures and plant shut downs).
21742,I think it was the news media that really destroyed the reputation of the J&amp;J vaccine and the AZ one as well.
21743,We should release all the shots we have of those to India and other hard hit areas immediately where they can and will save millions of lives!
21744,Americans on the whole will refuse to take them so let them go save lives overseas.
21745,Which honestly is ridiculous.
21746,It's a big ask to expect the vast majority of doctors and nurses to all be in agreement on this conspiracy theory and not tell anyone.
21747,Then you're also expecting doctors toe either not tell their family it's all a hoax or expecting their family to also keep it a secret lol.
21748,Like my own mother is a doctor so am i to believe that she's hiding the truth from me and that my own mother wants me to be deliberately worried about covid when it's all a hoax in reality?
21749,Also let's say doctors are just labeling all deaths as covid.
21750,What for?
21751,If you say a financial gain then what about countries that have a universal healthcare system like say Canada or the UK.
21752,The government in those countries fund the healthcare system so there's no financial gain then for them to inflate the numbers.
21753,Thank you for posting.
21754,It is very unfortunate that just discussing these things has become taboo.
21755,"My uncle is turning 80 in a few weeks, he just got out of a month long stay at the hospital for a heart attack following his vaccination."
21756,No one has even raised the concern about the coincidence of the timing.
21757,"Yes I know that‚Äôs only one person, and given his age he should be vaccinated, but risk vs benefits should be considered and previous covid infection is a big factor as well."
21758,It's got nothing to do with vaccines.

21761,AZ basically stopped supplying the EU anyway.
21762,Last weeks supply was cut by 75% and according to Poland the EU will get nothing this week.
21763,(I really hope the last is not true - we need the vaccine)
21764,That is America's reference!
21765,I'm not sure what it was.
21766,I have zero idea what kind of motivation they would have intentionally failing to deliver.
21767,"But from what I understand the Belgian plant is delivering as it should, the other's have more problems I understand, but maybe at a more reasonable level."
21768,"They had some early production, including for their own Phase 3 trial, so they absolutely had some data to go on when estimating production capacity."
21769,But I don't think it was malicious.
21770,I see no motivation for that.
21771,I would guess there is some sort of dysfunction in the organization that made their production planning not work out.
21772,It's worth mentioning that AZ has not been a big vaccine producer before either.
21773,"&gt; so many of them refuse to do ANYTHING to actually solve the problem

There isn't a problem."
21774,That's their argument.

21780,I would rather them live another 20 years and be killed by COPD at that time.
21781,I think a reasonable line is to only let kids visit adults indoors who are vaccinated just because it's readily available now and why not reduce the risk if they can but  yeah kids don't need to be vaccinated in order to return to lots of activities.
21782,Why are you friends with those other people?

21787,Hol' up.
21788,"AZ severely under-delivered to the UK also, the only reason the UK did so well  in the short-term was they very quickly went for a 1st vaccination priority with an extended gap that made their less doses go further, I think they were the first to do so."

21872,He's still waiting for finals to be over this week then he's going in.

21884,He did this to prevent a run on masks and medical supplies.
21885,"Now he makes excuses that there was ""no data"" that, at that time, showed that mask to be an effective solution."
21886,"Again, another blatant lie."
21887,"Here's where your bias is blinding you to the problem, masks ARE effective, but when they lied about them not being effective in the beginning they ruined the public trust, so when they then MANDATE masks in many parts of the the country why would we then trust them to be telling us the truth next time?"

21956,You can take these medications to relieve post-vaccination side effects if you have no other medical reasons that prevent you from taking these medications normally.
21957,&gt; It is not recommended you take these medicines before vaccination for the purpose of trying to prevent side effects.

21984,Your math is wrong.
21985,"The 95% protection stat is ""protection from moderate to severe illness"", not protection against any infection."
21986,"The relevant stat is 70% protection from infection (and therefore transmission) after second dose: https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/04/23/covid-vaccine-single-dose-cuts-infection-rate-by-65percent-study-finds.html

21990,&gt; i would like to see some evidence that youngsters are not getting vaccinating because they want there parents/grandparents to become ill/possibly die because of global warming.
21991,"That's not what I said, and I hope you wont go spreading that false strawman information around."
21992,My point is that you need to make it possible (paid time off from work to get the vaccine) and personally beneficial (show why people with low risk should seek out vaccines) in order to get people to put in the effort.
21993,"I want everyone to be vaccinated that can be, which means we need to look at human nature and why they aren't getting vaccinated now."

There is no reason, none whatsoever, not scientifically, not socially, that vaccinated people cannot return back to normal."
22000,How many vaccinated cases?
22001,"At least 65% of all US adults have some immunity against Covid if you look at vaccinated (\~54%) plus infected (\~11%)

At least 57% of entire US population has some immunity using the same calculation"
22002,"I think, if he does go this route, whatever vaccine % goal he chooses will be shortly followed by the 50/100,000 metric he originally proposed."
22003,"Either way, using the vaccine % metric seems to be more motivating and something people can directly take action on, rather than tirelessly waiting around for cases to drop."
22004,A lot aren't from covid but are still caused by covid.
22005,My coworker pointed out that most excess deaths in Italy and Spain were from preventable deaths.
22006,His conclusion?
22007,Staff let people die to drive up numbers.
22008,Reality?
22009,Hospitals were overwhelmed by covid patients meaning staff had fewer resources to treat everyone.
22010,"Plus, staff getting sick meaning there's more patients and less staff which means less care for patients."
22011,People who could be saved if the hospital wasn't overcrowded with covid patients end up dying.
22012,Deaths from covid itself are not the biggest danger of the virus - it's the knock-on effects for the health sector as a whole.
22013,Yes.

22137,"Despite all the lost time in February, we're vaccinating at the same per capita rate as the US now and the CBC even has some projections showing us hitting 75% of the population with one dose about three weeks before them."
22138,"COVID-19 has definitely made the following words more common:
 
anosmia (loss of smell)

 hyposmia (reduced smell)

 parosmia (distorted smell)

 phantasomia (phantom smells)

 dysgeusia (distorted taste, all of the ""smell"" related things above are also connected to taste too)

and unfortunately altered taste like what you describe has happened to some folks after being diagnosed with COVID-19, including waxing and waning symptoms"
22139,"Biden promoted the vaccine, got superb vaccine distribution across most of the country, and has never denounced mask wearing or the vaccine."
22140,‚ÄòMostly all vaccinated‚Äô reads as ‚Äònot fully vaccinated‚Äô which fwiw I think is a difference that matters.
22141,"Your kids don‚Äôt care about meeting your friends, but if everyone they come into contact with has been fully vaccinated I‚Äôd be ok with them meeting."
22142,Yup.
22143,"On Twitter, it's been really crazy for me to see the same people who say ""follow the science!"""

22149,If enough of us do that it creates a large enough niche who demand better headlines that someone will step up and serve it.

22151,"The article states ""That process could be completed in the next several weeks."""
22152,"My dad was very hesitant about the vaccine, but I sent him this article saying you cannot come visit me (and your granddaughter) in Sweden without it, and he said he will get it now."

22158,Right?
22159,The awesome thing about being proven wrong is now you are a little bit smarter than you were before
22160,~40% of eligible Canadians have had a single dose of a vaccine.
22161,5m is more than enough for Canadia.
22162,Because they don‚Äôt need it.
22163,There is no major vaccine shortage in the U.S.
22164,Many other countries got AZ approved quickly because their rollout depended on it.
22165,The U.S was always going to be mainly Pfizer and Moderna so there was zero rush for it to be approved.
22166,They obviously realize now that there are other countries which would benefit way more than they would with these vaccines.
22167,If you‚Äôre concerned about the effectiveness of AZ look at the UK.
22168,Hint: they‚Äôre doing great.
22169,"Abstract
In a large cohort of US healthcare personnel (HCP) without prior COVID-19 infection, 94,382 doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine were administered to 49,220 individuals."
22170,The adjusted vaccine effectiveness following two doses of each of the two available brands of mRNA vaccine exceeded 96%.
22171,"Not sure about the USA specifically, but world wide excess deaths are estimated to be about 1.5-2x the mortality reflected in the Covid related deaths."
22172,So it‚Äôs pretty crazy people refuse to accept the numbers are that high when in reality they are much much higher.
22173,I tried to explain this to people on Facebook.
22174,"I got called a fucking moron who thought that 600k was the same as 560k by a dozen people for five days straight, even after posting to CDC articles that clearly explained the difference between official COVID numbers and excess deaths."
22175,"There is no getting through to these people, we're better off with those ones getting COVID and leaving us in peace."
22176,Absolutely heartbroken by reports of people in the US not using the available vaccines.
22177,"The rest of the world is on fire and people here are just like ""LOL NO""

The pharmacies have already made a lot of money, they need to release the intellectual property rights to everyone that is able to make the vaccine"
22178,in the short term we'll likely need a vaccination/year.
22179,"However, covid mutates much much more slowly than influenza so once the spread is globally slowed, its likely our vaccination will last a very long time."
22180,We are also looking into developing more generalized vaccines that can handle a wide range of mutations.

22284,"&amp;#x200B;

Well over here in reality I can just remember how people were hoarding literal truck fulls of medical grade masks early in the pandemic, and the reports of shortages for medical professionals."
22285,If you have to appeal to 'common sense' then maybe you have less reason for your position than you might think.

&gt;  even the WHO said masks didnt work and they had no such concern about a shortage."
22287,"&amp;#x200B;

Can you source this claim for me?"
22288,"Because I have never seen a quote even close to 'masks don't work' coming from any medical professional, but people keep acting like this was said over and over."
22289,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt; The surgeon general said masks ‚Äòdon‚Äôt work to prevent the coronavirus 

&amp;#x200B;

And this is still understood to be true."
22290,"They work to **prevent the spread by people already infected**, not to protect the person wearing the mask from contracting the virus."
22291,"&amp;#x200B;

Can you dispute that fact, and agree that this statement clarifying how masks do work is different from just saying ""masks don't work""?"
22292,"Given the time frame of 7 weeks to grow a batch and the short time frames involved it's easily possible for the 2020Q1 deliveries to be 2/3 down, given that they've been trying to get yields up for Q1 and 2020Q4 (and maybe earlier) because they've only been getting 1/3 of what they hoped for from a lot of their batches."
22293,"However, at some point it should have been obvious to AstraZeneca the odds of them resolving their yield problems was not going to be a timely occurance, if at all, and that in order to compensate they would need to triple their manufacturing in order to get close to their delivery targets for late 2021Q1 and 2021Q2."
22294,"There's even provision in their contract with the EU to do just that by setting up additional facilities, except AZ didn't do it, for whatever reason (it'll be money)."
22295,Legally the problem with the 'best efforts' term is... compared to what.
22296,"Traditional vaccine manufacturing took more like five years, and most other vaccines for this pandemic have taken longer than AZ to be ready."
22297,More likely the EU lawyers will go for the failure to notify about production shortages and not setting up additional facilities to increase production when those problems failed to be resolved in a timely manner (but again what is traditionally a 'timely manner' for making vaccines?).
22298,I don't anticipate this being a speedy lawsuit and given all the first time ever processes it probably favours AstraZeneca  60:40.

22322,"It‚Äôll be good to see the statistics, but intuitively, I suspect outdoor transmission isn‚Äôt really happening."
22323,"When Emily Viegas started exhibiting some of the same COVID-19 symptoms that had put her mother in hospital ‚Äì difficulty breathing, an inability to stand ‚Äì her father, Carlos, faced an agonizing situation."
22324,"He was the only one in his family of four who had tested negative for COVID-19 and was at home in Brampton, Ont., with his two children while his wife was at Brampton Civic Hospital on oxygen."
22325,Mr. Viegas was under strict self-isolation orders from public health and wasn‚Äôt sure if he should call an ambulance.
22326,"He also knew Brampton Civic was one of the most strained hospitals in the country and he feared his daughter might be taken to a hospital further away in another Toronto suburb, Oakville."
22327,He didn‚Äôt like the idea of her being separated from both her parents.
22328,"He routinely checked her temperature, gave her Tylenol to bring her fever down, and urged her to drink lots of water and eat some of her favourite foods ‚Äì hot dogs and multi-grain pasta ‚Äì even though she didn‚Äôt have much of an appetite."
22329,"She was 13, Mr. Viegas reasoned, and she would probably be back to normal quickly."
22330,"The next day, April 22, she became one of the youngest Canadians to die from COVID-19 ‚Äì and part of a growing trend of younger victims in the pandemic‚Äôs third wave."
22331,Severe outcomes from COVID-19 infections remain exceedingly rare in children.
22332,"Though 208,195 people under 19 have been infected with COVID-19 as of April 23, the majority have had mild cases."
22333,"In total, 142 have been admitted to ICU and eight have died, according to national statistics."
22334,Though Mr. Viegas was the only one in the family to leave the apartment over the past many months ‚Äì he was the sole breadwinner and worked at a warehouse ‚Äì he was somehow the only one spared from COVID-19.
22335,"His wife was the first one to fall ill, though she stayed at home for a week before getting tested and learning she had the coronavirus."
22336,"During that period, Mr. Viegas continued going to work and his children occasionally went into their mother‚Äôs room to bring her food and water."
22337,"On April 14, the day after Mr. Viegas‚Äôs wife got her test results, she had so much trouble breathing that she was taken to hospital and put on oxygen."
22338,"Back at the apartment, Emily had developed a stubborn cough, but otherwise felt well."
22339,Well enough to engage in the moody sparring most 13-year-olds have with their parents.
22340,Mr. Viegas would tell her to stop playing Minecraft or texting her friends and do her homework.
22341,"‚ÄúNo way,‚Äù she‚Äôd respond, often with colourful language."
22342,"‚ÄúGet lost, old man.‚Äù

But after a week, as a fever came on and Emily‚Äôs breathing became laboured, their father-daughter exchanges shifted."
22343,"Mr. Viegas occasionally noticed Emily struggling to inhale, which would cause her to panic, which would only make it harder to take in air."
22344,"‚ÄúIt scared me, but I kept telling her, ‚ÄòSlow down."
22345,"Slow your breathing down so you‚Äôre not using all the energy you have to get air,‚Äô‚Äù he recalled."
22346,"On April 22, Emily woke up in the bedroom she shares with her younger brother, went to the bathroom, then returned to bed, lying beneath posters of mermaids and characters from the film Frozen."
22347,"Just after 9 a.m., Emily‚Äôs brother noticed she wasn‚Äôt moving and raced to get their father."
22348,"Mr. Viegas found his daughter laying eerily still, her eyes partly open, and completely unresponsive."
22349,He called 911 and was instructed to give his daughter CPR.
22350,"When paramedics arrived, they cleared Mr. Viegas and his son out of the room and tried to resuscitate Emily, too, and briefly got her heart beating again, but she still wasn‚Äôt breathing."
22351,They tried again.
22352,"After she was rushed to hospital, a doctor called Mr. Viegas and said they would try once more but if they failed, they‚Äôd pronounce her dead."
22353,"Three hours after Mr. Viegas had put his head on his daughter‚Äôs chest, he got another call she was gone."
22354,"Doctors said she not only had COVID-19, but also pneumonia."
22355,"‚ÄúTo tell you the truth, it felt real when I found her in bed."
22356,I put my head to her chest and I couldn‚Äôt feel nothing.
22357,No heartbeat.
22358,No nothing.
22359,"No breathing,‚Äù Mr. Viegas said."
22360,Sudden deaths in young people have become more common in this third wave of the pandemic.
22361,"In the first three weeks of April, Ontario‚Äôs coroners have seen 25 cases of people in Southern and Central Ontario who have died at home from the illness, some in their 20s and 30s."
22362,"The Viegases live in a two-bedroom apartment in a COVID-19 hot spot in east Brampton, a city with a 22-per-cent test positivity rate, the highest in Ontario."
22363,"That‚Äôs in large part because of the high volume of essential workers in the city, many of whom live in crowded housing where it‚Äôs difficult to physically distance."
22364,"Mr. Viegas, 58, got vaccinated on April 12, but his wife, still recovering in hospital, hasn‚Äôt received her jab yet."
22365,"While a patchwork of mobile vaccination clinics have opened across Toronto hot spots to offer vaccines to anyone over 18, there is only one such clinic housed at a large Hindu temple for hot-spot residents of Brampton ‚Äì and, technically, it‚Äôs in Toronto."
22366,Mr. Viegas‚Äôs wife‚Äôs oxygen levels are up to 80 per cent now and he‚Äôs hopeful she‚Äôll come home soon.
22367,"Informing her of their daughter‚Äôs death was ‚Äúas hard as it could be,‚Äù he said."
22368,"As Mr. Viegas is still in isolation, the business of sharing the news with friends and making funeral arrangements have fallen to other members of the family."
22369,‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know details.
22370,"I don‚Äôt even know if we‚Äôre going to have the viewing or not,‚Äù Mr. Viegas said."
22371,‚ÄúAnd my mother‚Äôs not going because she doesn‚Äôt want to see her granddaughter in a box.‚Äù
22372,Looking at numbers the UK is actually better off than the US currently and definately Europe.
22373,This mentality it is some b grade vaccine is bizarre.

22451,There isn't really a carrot at that point.
22452,The rules *already are* that you can stop wearing a mask at indoor private gatherings if you're all vaccinated.

22485,If putting people over profits means allowing countless millions of people to not receive a vaccine and die then I'll happily put profits first.
22486,"It's not a matter of money, this a matter of a disgusting lack of vaccines."
22487,The EU gave a ridiculous sum of money to AZ for production of vaccines to save lives and they're simply not arriving.
22488,12m doses were promised this week from AZ and was simply cancelled.
22489,This was announced from them at the end of March to expect this large shipment.
22490,12m people who were scheduled for a vaccine who simply won't receive it now and are waiting for AZ to announce a delivery date for those doses or for Pfizer to actually deliver and save lives.
22491,You can absolutely have complications due to taking a vaccine.
22492,Covid Deaths are counted as died with covid not from.
22493,It‚Äôs literally common knowledge at this point.
22494,Vaccines also attack your immune system thats how they work.
22495,The idea is that it‚Äôs not strong enough to actually harm you and your body will produce antibodies after the vaccine is introduced.
22496,"But when you rush an experimental vaccine that isn‚Äôt even made with dead viral cells, but active proteins that straight up attack your immune system, thats where the problem comes from."

22502,What state?
22503,It's not a matter of if it's good enough.
22504,It's a matter of public perception.
22505,I would take it but many are hesitant now.
