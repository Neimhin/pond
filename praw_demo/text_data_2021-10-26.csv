Just assumptions, dont think Merck would already voluntary licensing molnupiravir considered mind blowing success that's better others them. Lovely believe read Pfizer already like 20 million doses ready roll kids whenever approved. article goes way squash claim saying pill reduced hospitalizations 50%. best article world, really understand claim.

There definitely profit motive here, sure is.

Zombeavers? ...You guys scientists, not??? problem everyone complaining annual Covid shots ones get boosters vaccines. study , that's I'm asking, show included. try find info back data pill actually looks promising, I'm sure make money tho vaccination also makes waves smaller ... vaccines really good stopping infection (and transmission) avoiding hospitals/ICUs. Boosters authorized anyone age 18. one knows advised six months‚Äî depends data then. many top CDC people already resigned this? Good luck ;) really know; Like you, think people changing behavior big part it; also think that, pure chance/luck, people susceptible \*right now\* particular strains going around, get it; people get it, virus runs easy targets, new cases drop (and virtuous cycle). Pfizer study, enough show safe enough show whether vaccine worked (none prior infected children vaccine placebo group got sick).  done worrying killing nutty anti-vaxxers

what fuck Pfizer vaccine, it‚Äôs dose different purposes.

3rd dose immunosuppressed patients given 1 month 2nd dose ( time 2nd dose earlier) 2 doses may enough mount good primary immune response.  


3rd dose booster 6 months give secondary immune response.

in situation, since it‚Äôs 6 months could considered either, it‚Äôs vaccine. can‚Äôt take seriously. it‚Äôs mandated joins list mandated vax school children. take kids school? often line run insurance company, separate doctor's office.

I remind Covid Global Health Crisis, political one. mentioned above, tone deafness prevalent people like recovery efforts get sabotaged.

Actually, know effects long-term education disruption are? evidence from, say, natural disasters war? effective vaccines available world, better. state efficacy percentage Delta, still effective Alpha (86.3%), 96.4% original strain (so strictly speaking, *better* either mRNA vaccine use). Plus, fact traditional-style vaccine makes easily transported hopefully appealing people skeptical mRNA technology. approving use smaller doses administered adult vaccine. approved vaccine 5-11 comes special vials right dosage. health care provider talking using adult vials may confused. common misunderstanding.  Read wrote, think bit see figure statement differs mine. Also consider higher transmissibility Delta means out-of-date stats.

Cool story car accidents though! Well, 5+ protected kids little safer kids around them. I'm noticing lot events lately (fandom conventions) require 100% vaccination attendees wear masks. often going beyond local government requirements. Sometimes feel like excessive. real merit requiring 100% mask wearing attendees vaccinated?

Don't get wrong, completely requiring attendees event vaccinated. without question mind. feels like requiring masks ""wearing belt suspenders"" kind situation me, wonder I'm wrong.  chances hospitalization less 1 1000, 1 100.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  hope everyone trust mRNA vaccines takes one. 3-dose-series vaccines lifetime protection pretty common, could one them. believe signals Covid going start behaving like Flu need new formula. COVID PogU record daily toll explanation; restrictions introduced, like requirement proof vaccine recovery; tests enough.

The drawback many prefer Janssen faster, infinitely better nothing. I've seen, people use 3rd dose booster shot interchangeably. I'd surprised somebody doesn't. Awesome, sure bundle run. son joining dad alone today? preventative like vaccines. reduces severity COVID symptoms get infected. compare obesity rate high vaccination states low vaccination states.

That probably accounts almost difference. This! many made known.

Kind point protest tho... NHS UK makes deals manufacturers country. Buying bulk = better deal. go get fucking booster. vaccine shortage here. literally thousands appointments. see didn‚Äôt answer question directly. Thanks confirming. * 144 million Russia vs 333 milliion US. 1100 daily deaths would 2500 US.
* Massive undercounting Russia. Last year 56k Covid deaths got 362k excess deaths. 2500 could well least 5000, US ever had. (Yes, US countries also undercount near Russia.) [The also good paper russias undercount.
* Russia got 33% fully vaccinated US got almost 60%. (How many got Sputnik V? many got EpiVac vaccines? many got 1st dose (Sputnik Light)? many bought cert? Nice ""jumps"" Russias curve...).
* US goal 100 million doses 100 days, outcome 200 million doses 100 days. Russia's goal 60% fully vaccinated September...
* US seeing end, Russia going lockdown. Russia setting time records. 


Comparing Russia US relevant. inevitable outcome exceedingly unlikely vaccine harmful safe people year two older, we're middle pandemic serious virus, regulatory agencies dragging feet delaying things. (Which, yes were, ask American Academy Pediatrics).  Nice argument bud. So...vaccines kids? Anyone know side effects? Everything find talking severe life threatening effects (next nil). arm sore shot one real sick 36 hours shot 2. kid's (8yo) reaction similar? Hey ok admit wrong. think people would think much highly shutting like toddler actually say point specifically immunocompromised people ever need two shots? CDC &amp; FDA make clear distinction.

3rd dose primary series immune compromised; without 3rd dose may never sufficiently protective immunity.

Booster someone likely sufficiently protective immunity time waned.

Someone immune compromised going due booster six months 3rd shot. Plus, realize purpose every living thing ever exist procreate? great initiative, concern time takes facilities done distribute jabs properly.  America equity concerns. FDA/CDC want people going unvaccinated lack appropriate documentation, certain populations often have.    Pfizer fully approved (for 16+), Novavax even apply EUA anymore US? believe one conditions EUA fully-approved vaccine available. Yeah, same. side effects J&amp;J lasted week me. effects Pfizer booster nothing comparison. prepared sore arm come armed ibuprofen. totally manageable ibuprofen me. lasted two days left quickly started. would say sore arm hit around hour twelve post shot.  agree using method haven‚Äôt used before. go compare timetable method others. surprised difference? Even tho pandemic every top mind respective fields working towards it. Get psychopath Data Israel shows far lower incidence myocarditis booster dose 2nd dose. use Pfizer data reassuring. Maybe related long time interval doses? anyone risk myocarditis 2nd dose people didn‚Äôt get 3rd?

Anyway incidence 30+ extraordinary small begin with. yep, doesn‚Äôt mean shouldn‚Äôt Again, clear children know speak of. immunocompromised occupational hazards still. I'd imagine general population get feel good enough ones likely fill beds That's me, right, forgot number are.  Thanks much information, NEED 3rd well kind weary since first two go well hoped, still still better covid 10000%. wish knew expect 2nd shot threw loop expecting. hope feel 100% soon. man area thinks nurses return travel assignments, shun society ‚Äúabandoning community.‚Äù doozy post. man PISSED people trying maximize earnings thought punished instead local hospital systems won‚Äôt support staff.

Like replies say, third dose that's EUA'd immunocompromised full moderna dose, moderna booster larger EUA half dose. Unless immunocompromised (or 60, maybe), smaller dose good.

Out curiosity, family‚Äôs stance vaccine since death? Eastern Europeans don‚Äôt believe vaccines, happens. Time ask money, start looking new job! Take advantage can! Fwiw it‚Äôs near inner elbow. Flu Vax given shoulder. arm though collapse USSR

In opinion, way government handled public relations USSR contributed conspiracy theories. example, uncommon try hide information natural man-made disasters (actually, anything *could* present government bad way) point local residents know radiation leak town. Well... good you, guess. Memory B cells cells cornerstone long term immune system.

Memory cells quickly make killer cells. Memory B cells generate mast cells make antibodies. 

Antibodies wane essentially dead particles circulate awhile breakdown. cells eventually die stop making antibodies found anything attack awhile.

But memory cells persist much longer. long depends body vaccine.  year, too! Sadly disagree.  I'm vaxxed (even natural immunity, believe in). wife vaxxed circumstances. family is, exception sister (who wish would be).

I can't see giving 6 7 year old children vaccinated time. article says still questions regarding myocarditis potential reactions. can't it. Sure. paper. borderline cases going admitted far often peds adults.

*I bot, action performed automatically.

Covid also causes myocarditis too, significantly higher rates. fatal... worst cases, treated steroids. It‚Äôs completely excessive defeats purpose. Masks environment minimal additional protection factor vaccinated individuals already significantly less likely even contract COVID shed lower viral loads clear faster unvaccinated individuals. 

Sure, there‚Äôs always chance, scale it‚Äôs overkill.  Canada 1/10 population US. 

The system overwhelmed ignorant oppositional. Unless live fly fly community, valid excuse vaccinated. Vaccination cuts hospitalization.  reason enough? routinely setting new records. alarmed outraged.   aren‚Äôt requiring masks outdoors, inside.  BMI requirement 25 20. Breakthrough infections certainly possible. Vaccination alone (Covaxin/inactivated covishield/vectored) gives solid protection infection early on, wanes. vectored vaccine, like mRNA, gives 90% protection hospitalization/death *if infected*, wane. Inactivated somewhat worse, though also much cheaper better safety profile. 

But changes infected before, India highest attack rate country (90% Mumbai one study, likely HIGHLY variable across regions) caught guard Delta. Infection alone likely comparable vaccination, many decline vaccination surely infected. Infection plus vaccination holy-grail immunity infection.

Regardless above, danger depends linearly much Delta area. Much India low prevalence right now, pockets higher. Both. disagree, I'm saying two vaccines entirely comparable. CVS known never applied criteria getting shot. Even early release still Phase restricted would let anyone get question asked. think mean 2017. election 2016 Obama leave office January 2017.

There's 100 Delta Plus variants. media kinda shortsighted calling Delta Plus, opinion.. 

Here AY.4 UK - ~ 70% New cases. AY.4.2 UK-- ~11% New cases. ever get cold sores? Chicken pox child? Guess causes that! reduce severity symptoms, actually combat infection? True. Dental care costly US. There's reason UK many infections despite excellent vaccination rate: no-one wears masks, particularly children schools. wearing almost 2 years, sick once. even sniffle.

This vaccination masks become progressively less voluntary, simply required activities. feel like argument ""live let live"" puts higher value anti-vaxxers' rights healthcare workers' health/rights well health people requiring regular medical procedures. use nurse line often, pass recommendations brain :), almost confirm bias :), often get good information. work insurance company, doctor's office, actually err side sending doctor :)

For example, I'd assume case they'd say go doctor, ask info, like get rash etc.

About cortisone cream, lasts hours ... instructions, like ""don't use 6 times day"" something like also anxiety. booster almost nothing fear. 95% effective symptoms comparison 2 doses. Start going stores places mask on. try bigger events Apparently side-question boosters distracted main question intending ask.

If child 11 1/2 child vaccine approved use, best course action (a) get kid vaccine immediately (which smaller dose), (b) wait six months get adult vaccine?  jesus... uhh duh? Russian psyops/troll farms via Facebook social media platforms. Theory aspirating needles may reduce cases myocarditis  done serology surveys past that? Unknown, six months year future hasn‚Äôt happened yet. can‚Äôt assume less durable- vaccines don‚Äôt predictable dose response curve, short term effect 50ug wasn‚Äôt meaningfully different 100 ug, don‚Äôt correlate protection. even study good responses 25 ug doses.  vaccinate school. Pandemics permanent kids 5-11 vaccinated, although could correct history would tell us point side thing. Yeah kinda complicated almost like waves ocean. increased natural immunity recent surges also waning immunity lot people. question remains eager people jump booster shots. can't see booster shot rate higher saw earlier spring.

Winter naturally brings trouble cooler temperatures also holidays. things trending better now, could well see least surge (unclear severe) holidays. dumb idea. smack middle shortage time. 

The post office (?) leader championed distribution flyer make DIY masks  anyone vaccinating people 12? US even starting till next week. There‚Äôs much ignorance here, wrote massive paragraph deleted knew wouldn‚Äôt change mind. 

Speak healthcare workers experience say views things them. may agree vast majority would share hell they‚Äôve gone still go back every day working horrible hours protect save ungrateful people like you.   No, opposite. booster less likely transmit disease someone. sounds like ethical position me,

Eventually CDC admit 3-dose vaccine. Really appreciated article. Thanks sharing. 

I say every single pediatrician spoken seen interviews say kids first line take it. benefits absolutely outweigh risks. airborne transmission, much stricter criteria applied accepting it, multiple step deductive reasoning without direct evidence. Question: United States major investor Novavax giving billion dollars... come Novavax decide prioritize countries first?

I'm saying help countries... financial obligation bring product major investors first? country invested money right see vaccine delivered them. billion dollars lot money.  I'm sorry family. I've known double vaxxed passed away number hospitalized, seems extra tragic even booster help. really think need national vaccine mandate. bet fun parties broken system sure, like anything problems complain, hearing crappy plans without insurance. insurance covers things fine. depends heavily employer employer chooses offer you. even measure ‚Äúrate‚Äù cases? I‚Äôm thinking rubbish would much work sample population get good feel time road Agree. look vaccination rates region, makes sense, like Malaysia Cambodia.

Still, Chinese vaccines produced moment Morocco, Algeria Egypt. Might case countries too. seems like China (and lesser extent, Russia Cuba exploring production too) understanding importance Africa side. Awesome! fraction happens long period time though, versus immediate nature car plane crashes, drowning.

As pandemic climate change proven, consequences action inaction far enough future (mere days weeks case COVID... never mind climate change consequence horizon years decades), good many people take necessary steps prevent slightest inconvenience.

Lol  ""I Even Want Around Anymore"" better ways get people get shots.  mean anyone get booster past 6 months want? answering ‚Äúplenty vaccines aren‚Äôt given later on‚Äù politics, build endgame this. I'm willing live like like three years so.

People keep asking *when* pandemic end, instead *how* end it. like oooh 2022, automatically things change better. guy WHO, Tedros stated multiple times end lies within people's hands.

How end it? Take jab follow measures time. embarrasing like 60+ million dullheads USA want take vaccines costing everybody else's livelihoods. Yes Lauren Boebert. I‚Äôd think production already done level meet expected date approval *Lil John intensifies...*  vast majority places think even considered still EUA. 

And honestly, it‚Äôs going remain EUA long enough (and it‚Äôs big damn if) cases way seriously doubt schools mandate it. 

I think schools itching put Covid rear view. far schools concerned think it‚Äôs going end like Flu shot. get it, great, not, nobody cares. Hopefully this, masks allowed removed Disney world trip December ü§ûüèº  I'm pretty sure CVS Walgreens giving covid shots 5-11 year olds. Reading NYT article kind telling. considering kids really need get vaccinated. don‚Äôt care think. safe? let parents decide. states 64% fully vaccinated. would consider regular job seems, 'inoculation records' required public service personal civil city workers teachers nurses/doctors past 40 years says otherwise  recommended throughout lives protect serious diseases. protection childhood vaccines wears off, adolescents need vaccines extend protection. Adolescents need protection additional infections well, risk exposure increases.‚Äú

This quote says literally nothing infants would get vaccine infant vaccination general. Sure, thing pills intended replace vaccines, like Fauci others stated. means people still consider vaccinating order reduce chances dying illness, whether pills available not.

At time hugely embarrasing country like USA managed fully vaccinate 58% population tenths millions country want take vaccine part, USA would easily go past acute phase pandemic move normal-endemic phase 85% would fully vaccinated. would matter vaccinating children 12.

For god's sake, can't like Portugal Denmark take jab? vaccines political issue like climate change? Lives political points plz. believe CDC meets November 3, I'm expecting availability shortly thereafter. expecting 4th, may issues needing add solution vials due lower dosage may require manufacturing?? doubt diluting pharmacy allowed likely sample testing concentration needs happen plant like setting gross quality control.

People severely immunosuppressed (including, limited to: higher-dose immunosuppressants; received stem-cell transplant; recent organ transplant recipients; leukaemia) eligible **one 'third primary dose' 8 weeks second dose. 6 months that, get one booster**. 

This [some evidence reasonably hefty 40% people severely immunosuppressed much smaller immune response first two doses *either* people low-risk, (like me) bog-standard high-risk. 

The third primary dose seems help 'catch up' antibody levels everyone else's two doses, booster 6 months likely work *as actual booster* them.

Based that, infection via surfaces (fomites) need masks kept distance washed hands time, messaging ""masks work"" and/or ""save masks frontline workers"" obviously can't maintain distance.

The problem was, size threshold specific tuberculosis spread, effectively infect inhaled via coarse mist larger 5 microns. misinterpreted mean *all* aerosol transmission maxed 5 microns, even though study based research suggesting threshold closer 100 microns.

And people refuse wear mandated masks stop going, that's win well since they're also probably making poor choices regarding pandemic safety areas. I'm definitely favour mandates. I've got 2 4 year old. awesome understand need thorough next age group I'm freaking tired waiting Thank taking time write clear concise answer. 

So understand correctly, reason cases high with:

1) Lack previous exposure population. Indicating natural immunity fairly important keeping cases low, addition vaccination. 

2) Behavior (lockdowns). believe Singapore currently implementing strict lockdown measures though, sure lockdown would contributing opposite effect. 

3) cases vaccinated proportionally high population vaxxed expected. happens if, example, students 100% vaccinated, go home? Would new variant? Would vaccine effectiveness diminish?

The possibility never, ever go away. aren‚Äôt discussing now, seems without pressure they‚Äôll always put off.

I understand frustration, but, putting shoes university president, I'd try promise little possible, vague possible :). There's still much uncertainty, opinion, especially happen 6 months.

Would high vaccination rates factor? happens if, example, students 100% vaccinated, go home? Would new variant? Would vaccine effectiveness diminish?

It's important separate data clearly supports something correlations occur different conditions. IOW, data clearly supports vaccinations reducing infections transmissions (as well hospitalizations deaths).

However, that's independent might observed cherry-pick data elsewhere ignoring causation-correlation.

Singapore strict pandemic measures. extremely different culture US. such, relatively cases. Even current spike, 329 deaths less 30K cases per million. compares 140K cases per million US.

So... date, Singapore strict relatively far fewer cases deaths.

Along comes vaccine. Singapore vaccinated country top 10 (I believe #6) terms doses per 100 people. great vaccines, still 80% fully vaccinated (of eligible).

Singapore lifted restrictions masks, social distancing, venue capacities, etc...

So Delta, relatively natural immunity 20% still vaccinated (plus eligible yet) people fully returned pre-2020 behavior.

Also consider Reuters:

*Of Singapore's 1,096 locally transmitted infections last 28 days, 484, 44%, fully vaccinated people, 30% partially vaccinated 25% unvaccinated, Thursday's data showed. seven cases serious illness required oxygen, another critical condition intensive care, none eight fully vaccinated, health ministry said.*

Considering 80% fully vaccinated, thought 44% cases fully vaccinated may seem misleading, remember vaccination approaches 100%, percentage breakthroughs well, course outcomes show significant difference. Well, true. estimated comparing [case rate age [overall hospitalization rate age exact use different groupings, looks like 0.4% kids COVID get hospitalized. Another way approximate use [case surveillance get 0.5% hospitalized recently. Anyway, take 37 per 100k, multiply 62 million 5-19 year olds country, multiply 0.4%, 91. lotto ticket odds, zero kids.

Although comparing closely, think something's Michigan's data. case rates age seem 40% CDC's, using enrolled denominator bumped there. real take-away schools breeding ground Covid masks not

That's really ""take-away"".

Areas take precautions Covid significantly worse results schools (and measure want compare) areas take precautions Covid. 

And data clearly shows masks *do make difference* lowering spread Covid schools, everywhere else, too.   anecdotal evidence logical fallacy. frustratingly prevalent logic error.

Once social distancing guidelines go away, flu may spread easily you‚Äôre going see covid sudden become dramatically less contagious. Covid flu deaths would rise flu won‚Äôt sudden outcompete Covid‚Ä¶unless vaccines significantly dent either spread mortality Covid, both.

Healthy person: Initial two dose series, booster six months

Immunocompromised: Initial two doses, third complete series three weeks later, booster six months later

The important part says nothing vaccine longevity effectiveness/duration booster. people targeting ones poor response initial series need stronger immune response develop receive booster later Agreed. point I'm done caring bigger picture, want get youngest fully vaccinated move on. specific zip code 67% fully vaccinated even including nearly 30% population children (0-17 years). sufficient data really guess sort percentage children get vaccines easily pass 70% within month making vaccines available kids I'd expect us easily pass 80% end year. numbers may great compared areas Texas that's big deal. someone lifelong disability now-vaccine-preventable disease got 3 (vaccine approved 2yos now) think you‚Äôre completely base head sand.

Your denial bad stuff happens doesn‚Äôt make happen. 660k August 800k now. 1500 excess deaths per day pandemic. Colombia Fighting violence violence never works. literally said ""the current vaccines suck."" apparently massive reductions infections, hospitalizations, deaths enough. huge amount pressure approve boosters, many scientists think necessary people now. Older folks immunocompromised folks different risk profiles therefore different needs. scientific consensus average 30 year old must booster six months post second dose. limited knowledge vaccine research, significant experience designing experiments, best guess effect vaccine children previously caught covid researched, results may published yet, published picked news outlets. 

When designing experiments important groups rule confounding factors, case looking immune response, means excluding people covid point therefore immune system may primed.

If official phase study included children already covid point, observed effectiveness vaccine may inaccurate, means probably pass peer review. 

Research expensive time consuming, doubt somebody looking effectiveness vaccine children covid point, probably difficult first get volunteers prerequisite paperwork details caught covid, specific strain, long infected, regular antibody test results following fight covid. Given variability virus affects someone's immune system, I'd expect need large sample size, compounds difficulty running research.  Less severe symptoms usually means less coughing/sneezing/other means spewing viral pathogens  also misinformation downplaying pandemic. Daily deaths &amp; cases massive undercounted systematic way. Also downplaying giving sense ""everything control"", ""better countries"", no-lockdown one day next lockdown, gives mixed messages downplaying pandemic. Result 33% fully vaccinated record deaths.  Actually whether licence vaccine children given natural immunity issue integrally part voting question. point repeatedly raised committee members, one abstained partly it, Cody Meissner voted dissenting opinion based this.

Buried within guidance list people getting booster dose 3rd dose moderate severely immunocompromised individuals.

If vaccine needed reduce severity symptoms, rather transmission, push vaccinate low risk groups? I.e. children, young healthy adults, etc. Yup. Get vax on! Depending country, fake vaccination cards exist. Thus masks still called especially high concentration people.

Women get PUPPs rash often severely male fetuses. Speculation foreign baby, stronger reaction (moms less like sons daughters).    Well, hope helps dispel arguments pro-mandate people everyone wear masks protect individual immunocompromised person. 

We need move past mask mandates place mandate vaccines, individuals need protection use high quality masks protection.    Let's see put together COVID-denier Starter Pack types responses would expect see. (Note: anyone playing home, bad-faith arguments disproven lines reasoning)
 
 - ""If die heart attack car accident whatever tested positive COVID, hospital still counts death get sweet government bucks."" 
 - ""Most dying old dudes seventies eighties couple years life remaining anyway, count."" 
 - ""It's fake numbers Deep State anyway, would trust lied everything before?"" 
 - ""Just normal flu deaths, crazy virus. Notice number people died flu 2020 dropped number deaths so-called virus started go up."" 
 - ""It's 0.00000000000000001% population anyway, making big deal it?"" 
 - ""Everyone's going get anyway eventually, need everyone get herd immunity, might well get with.""  
 
Mind you, **not** advocating - reiterate, false disproven talking points. type stuff keep hearing COVID conspiracy apologists adjust tin-foil hats little bit more. thought might Savannah River National Lab, thing happening here. lot people work lab near retirement age. They're scientists, lab techs &amp; admins started straight high school possible back day. expect early retirements, angry folks, work go new people come in. Depends causes it, another pandemic flu COVID event yeah agree, something like ebola, plague hemmorgic fever think would different knowledge, yes. Well got back getting Booster two pharmacists recommended Moderna got one. asked said little better efficacy mother, they'd recommend one. we'll see; 3 hrs far symptoms. entire office went last week - everyone felt effects shot #2. husband fine, #2. people felt like hell #2 felt like hell #3. Maybe happens. also happened covid. wear masks event encountered immunocompromised person. Immunocompromised people protect need now. suggest 330 million people wear masks protect less 100,000 immunocompromised people outlandish best.

The thing miss likelihood happening. First, vaccinated. means less likely covid. Second, would reasonably close encounter immunocompromised person. encounter would need long enough duration infect them. would need inhale virus particles. top this, would wearing mask. words, unlikely. makes feel better wear mask unlikely scenario, wear one.  There‚Äôs certain personality type thinks expert one field, smart automatically expert fields. example, highly respected brain surgeon might claim pyramids built store grain, acknowledged expert field corruption money laundering might believe he‚Äôs also expert virology, military tactics, nuclear, among numerous fields. Meanwhile 5 people die Benghazi make hay decades..  point Boulder, particle saw dip here, people gone back wearing them. I'm Walmart shopper &amp; even see around 10%, most, wearing them, wearing incorrectly. shop lower income areas well. I'm sure everywhere &amp; know many places longer even try encourage mask use. Yes, part handling Covid too? Minimising effect economy. got 3rd ago, also immunocompromised. really rough go - fever, chills, fatigue days. scariest bit heart symptoms. shortness breath laying standing, felt like would burst chest. underlying heart issues worst I‚Äôve experienced. gone ER‚Ä¶ approved. couldn‚Äôt wait needed flying internationally move another country postgrad work, risk getting going high.

For record, 0 symptoms first, chills half day second. United States purchased 1.2 billion vaccine doses, enough inoculate entire population twice over, may many 500 million excess doses end October possibly one billion December. Extra vaccines beginning accumulate rapidly growing numbers doses destroyed.

I'd like see supported evidence US 500 million excess doses hand. Getting pretty irritated calling around trying get booster shot today everyone saying ""only take appointments"" yet got original 2 shots constantly announcing shots available people canceling. agreement you. simply taking step closer user's point order demonstrate fallacy. fair large part true people wearing homemade cloth masks, pretty much thing available last April. everyone collectively wearing masks lessen overall spread. there's reason people shoulda minimum wearing surgical masks, really anyone paying attention moved N95 variety equivalents like KN95/LF94/FF2/etc. masks actually protect wearer considerably individual level. person crowd wearing cloth mask going matter much. person crowd wearing properly fitting N95 actually going good job protecting you. Somehow, Merck manages ethical pharma companies. 0.3% cars road fatal accidents everyone would freak f out. 0.3% planes fell sky. opinion argument/opinion people willingly died &amp; one else's fault. That's B.S. me. one deserves die simple things, like wearing mask, help stop spread, whether vaccinated not. say government reckless, ranking also based economical factors. could worded better. full dose Moderna 100mcg 3 times strong Pfizer 30mcg. Even halving it, Moderna still 60% stronger full dose Pfizer.

Moderna‚Äôs full dose probably thought overkill, hence reduction 50mcg booster shots. Great, definitely support that. honestly get dude. I'm honestly so, goddamn burnt COVID shit. long fuck since over. 

Like, even stupid conversation first place. looking back March 2021 COVID-19 essentially eradicated. could maybe dumb chat memes instead. 

I'm pretty sure going visit children's oncology ward anytime soon. do, I'm pretty sure wear mask. really problem, someone viewpoint likely quite complementary disagree smaller point. Titanic sinking, disagreeing placement deck chairs. 

I'm tired. really get wanna wear mask, neither - uncomfortable, also physical reminder half goddamn country obstinately refuses eat fucking vegetables.  Definitely seems odd too... I'm pretty sure that's happened AstraZeneca trial UK last year. participants half-dose first dose, full second, combination best results. Tell us know non-profit means without telling us know non-profit means. 

These hospitals generate vast amounts profit despite interpretation. literally tax label hospitals get tax breaks meeting minimum threshold community benefit. nefarious tax loophole. 

You absolutely destroy financial livelihood insurance need cancer treatment make 69K. fucked financially even insurance.

Better inform yourself. inhalers steroids (like budesonide)? could consider full dose.  leaders let minority membership guide decisions issues waste members resources.

Even members favor it, still think union would choose fight matter principle. Though good requirement, still *new* requirement employment Southwest. exactly kind things unions supposed negotiate over.  Nah. Cold still floating around well.  sorts reports early may need booster shots perhaps annual shots like flu. head Pfizer announced early people attacked money grab. 

Here report far able tell earlier experts saying would wait see. sure else could done. real problem pretending hard enough.  Well said! Ireland cautious reopening Europe. really fair say government reckless, they're usually criticised opposite. makes sense although I'm immune supressers told lady well 2 asthma inhalers. wonder maybe misheard something.  check /r/qanoncasualties. Even know Q specifically falls that. kid socializing Delta surged note specifically said kids age. cousins she‚Äôs played whole time ‚Ä¶ go back person school aren‚Äôt age. That‚Äôs different meeting new people county ‚Äúhigh risk‚Äù entire time. mean plus‚Ä¶ parents socialize kids don‚Äôt set aside day. Fox News encourages ignorant self-righteous rage... could go wrong? safe say people dying dying voluntarily? mean could take vaccine likely prevent death choose take risk death. European nations continued dominate top rungs index, joined United Arab Emirates Chile.

Europeans lucky streak lately. caused refuse wear masks &amp; infect do., get coming from. Handled borders well took ages mass vaccinate. booster dose people immune suppressing medicines full 3rd dose. booster regular people regular Pfizer 1/2 dose moderna. Pfizer lower dose (30 microgram) moderna (regular 100 / booster 50). one theory moderna lasting longer (could also 2nd dose interval. wish could accept that, recognize healthcare workers going right now. understaffed overworked biggest argument getting vaccine give healthcare workers well deserved fucking break. best vaccine get one that's available. Get 'em Pfizer, boost road Moderna. Protect (well, soon available mean) worry Moderna gets approved. Hopefully not. I‚Äôm also someone balks minor inconvenience makes others even marginally safer. course it‚Äôs decision made. ethics squares decision continue wearing one. Despite ugliness I‚Äôve seen last two years (really 5), refuse let change person already has. Ducey refused enact state wide one &amp; I'm sure set stage large number people. Many places opened soon &amp; rules got loopholes continue allow businesses stay open. I'm sure aware this, others may be. add experiences. got mine like 3 weeks ago (Pfizer). second dose gave high fever, chills, extreme fatigue. booster tired achey 2 days. boyfriend experience 2nd shot booster: fatigue headaches. think general consensus booster somewhere 1st 2nd doses terms side effects want congratulate AZ's Gov. Ducey incompetence regressive leadership. covid loving buddies FL, TX, AL, TN celebrating, achieved wanted - dead Americans. 

... side note, looked flu infographic, way bottom. Seems like Covid 13.6 times deadlier flu, least AZ. Great. time holidays. cases already weren‚Äôt going shoot indoor gatherings especially considering many southern states 50% vaccination rate many states barely break 60%. I'm last reply speaking specifically retirement communities. know someone grocery store recovering cancer immunocompromised?

You know. Unlike optional recreational opportunities, grocery shopping necessary people live. Wearing mask important care people around you.  give one data point, experience basically same. got J&amp;J March serious chills body aches. got Pfizer booster Monday, ill effects sore shoulder possibly _slight_ headache (though full disclosure could lingering hangover weekend).

You fine!  guess absolute related normal life. retirement facility since mother died intend going one again. Everyone different. reply related life expectations. could also switch careers become surgeon would need wear mask, unlikely me. worst virus country somehow even COVID last year. 99.9999% true. Ha, fixed. Chicken pox

If born five years later probably deal fucker :-( get mine hour. Prepared feel terrible. We'll see though guess. Per cap excess deaths US/Russia, plus Mexico/Brazil (next two bggest), Peru (highest per US is, actually top 30 per capita excess deaths. Good them.  forgot method repeat whatever dipshit said Facebook. Actual math important. 600 6.3 million? Thats statically insignificant numbers. almost gaurentee 99% 600 compromised immune system obese. kid danger riding bus school getting corona. *was* caused filthy conditions well. still around; issue places halfway decent sanitation. Got Moderna booster Monday. Felt first two - sore arm. High Deductible Health Plans incredibly common US. Preach. I‚Äôve worried J&amp;J efficacy time since found day one had. Glad boost one mRNA ones even happier Moderna. 

I also went ahead knocked flu shot time. 

That I‚Äôm able get amazing me. think, past two years, I‚Äôm never going take ease access lifesaving socially-responsible vaccines granted again. Americans still deductibles. got flu years back, paid around $140 Tamiflu. totally worth still really expensive. never applied criteria getting shot. Even early release still Phase restricted would let anyon

Damn, yeah mean less supply support that, think getting shot really changed anything someone else needed it. stupid works!

/s  Yeah I‚Äôm getting mine Saturday. work retail Florida think that‚Äôs high risk like, yeah, seatbelts work car falls 100 stories water. I'm gonna wear one anyway, 99.998% time effective.   determine someone immunocompromised public? Maybe cancer need go grocery shopping errands take place public. feel comfortable possibly spreading infection someone like that? stopped wearing mask June **under circumstance** return wearing one again.

When speak absolutes, surprised people take word. said ""nope, nu-uh, never"" backtracked pointed *the example comment chain already discussing.* 

Like, c'mon. choice. made different one. going wear mask rest life? chances dying something less quarter one percent, making ""11 times"" mean much. also vaccine loses effectiveness 5% every two months. take long matter all. small nit: dropped infectious diseases like flu people sheltered wore masks. otherwise, perfectly correct comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Maybe look UK data  case, see dramatic drops deaths causes deaths ""assigned"" Covid. Really? realize that. city US currently required schools (with varying degrees success fair) public places. part people pretty good wearing public transit stores, much bars restaurants. music venues forget (but require proof vaccination anyway). people seem wear fabric masks understand far pandemic. Fellow Bulgarian here, waiting third shot Pfizer yesterday infront RZI-VARNA, queue enormous. thing strike was, people willing vaccinate, protect close ones, go pub, eat, drink party. One lady late 50's said following ""If I'm going die made flu, least I'm going die full stomach""... deserve everything happening. never forgive ghouls decided make partisan issue. humor wasn‚Äôt lost me. However, people also desperate enough take risk. sometimes feels way here. Right South lowest case count anywhere I'm country. trying predict cases going forward can't look vaccine acquired immunity, look immunity. problem North point lots people's immunity waning, nearly many people getting boosted. oh great, thing learned last year showing again. get mask mandate cause I'm going guess we're going get one. Ah yes, somehow, hospitals, one singular whistleblower? get proof go paper. Fairly easy, happens time. telling me, every single person problem lying?

Earlier year, ethical issues skipping line get shot. general consensus due supply, risk get first, everyone else order recommended state. Skipping line could seen unethical.

With booster shots, longer supply issue, ethical concerns getting shot even technically qualify due age, health, career? like skipping booster means shots shipped overseas otherwise end arms need more. know knew guy knew guy went hospital broken wrist, never came death cert said Covid. think something.   definitely safe highly effective.

But FDA allowed Mix match, studies prove durability Moderna half dose Pfizer initial vaccine example.

Bye! requiring masks business area doesn‚Äôt require everywhere? would never rude worker, would frustrated policy too. 

I don‚Äôt even bother go businesses require masks cities don‚Äôt. mean I'm Canadian *think* impacts tried personally got breakthrough case. wasn‚Äôt sick would never said anything. surprising, many Fox viewers don‚Äôt fact check, don‚Äôt seek independent news sources ‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre tuning get confirmation bias stroked, get angry hear something don‚Äôt agree with. Ever since 9/11 ive occasionally bioterror attack dreams.

Usually I‚Äôm sealing windows doors staying house, knowing gas mask dont one wondering I‚Äôll ok. Ah, definitely rough. definitely get boosters havent already. always quarantine get tested end going concert draw line somewhere. anecdotes simply that, anacdotes. data effectiveness fresh vaccines boosters. infected vaxxed people know likely gotten boosters yet. I'm exact boat considering getting Moderna booster. following days? Going moderna initial weak sauce JJ shot.  think schools well reopenings started get decent body data strongly demonstrating opening schools probably pretty safe kids themselves--or least seen anything gave confidence mortality morbidity low schools resuming in-person learning. also think substantially underemphasizing risks potential longer-term effects, even mention broader public health implications bunch simultaneous outbreaks COVID schools adult population widely vaccinated. Even benefit hindsight, think clear sending kids back school much earlier generally did. get third booster 8 months since I've fully vaccinated? I'm 22 worried holidays.  Yes, FDA reviews efficacy safety vaccines per trial data. CDC responsible administration guidelines incorporating data.

 US Food Drug Administration (FDA) licenses vaccine determines data submitted manufacturer reveal vaccine safe effective intended use. US-licensed vaccine, FDA-approved prescribing information contains detailed information health care providers ensure safe effective use. Centers Disease Control Prevention recommendations use licensed vaccine often based additional considerations, disease epidemiology, public acceptance, vaccine supply, cost.¬† LOSE CARD CERTAINLY WILL.

This smart guy lost get boosted got new copy. Fortunately able to. even going try argue this, clearly made mind. must seen 700k people study done Israel proves natural infection far superior vaccines? Certainly, vaccines number one tool overcome disease.  3, typo bad. Fixed. plain bullshit.

Just bc delta spreads faster variant cease exist, long R 0.

Once delta cases go down, due immunity vaccines, nothing stopping variants escape existing immunity going rampant. Hell no, hell high water I‚Äôm going see extended family Christmas year‚Ä¶yes, means gathering 40+ people. We‚Äôre vaccinated, can‚Äôt forever.  Yup, we‚Äôre vaccinating kids primarily protect vulnerable adults. Going really wait see data. Need see adverse effects trial data, also 5-11 year olds real world data point used argument 12-15 year old data used today. Plus, ever changing landscape pandemic much risk kids getting sick time next meeting.

All said, seems like difficult approve point, namely reasons today isolating high-risk kids difficult borderline unethical consider socioeconomic effects have. Previously infected individuals huge unknown. Given high rate spread disease unvaccinated population, safe assumption previous infections almost nothing slow spread.

Vaccines incredibly effective preventing infection, literally reason use them

""The study looked effectiveness Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna mRNA vaccines preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections among 3,950 study participants six states 13-week period December 14, 2020 March 13, 2021. 
Results showed following second dose vaccine (the recommended number doses), risk infection reduced 90 percent two weeks vaccination. Following single dose either vaccine, participants‚Äô risk infection SARS-CoV-2 reduced 80 percent two weeks Yep, canada Yep, 0-4 something actually higher mortality rate covid 5-11 recall lines w/ saw. got family getaway trips w/ brother's family set late Jan, time we're hoping youngest get least first shot knows point. least announcement everyone vaccinated point. listen whole thing, multiple people panel talking they're hesitant recommend vaccine children 5-11 they're weighing unknown rare side-effects (i.e. rare show study) rare deaths age group. least one person pushing back judgement absurd given dangerous know COVID-19 even young children safe worst-case vaccines is.

The FDA seems strangely worried side-effects minor worried actual danger COVID-19, possible unknown long-term effects infection. also utterly uninterested actually thinking reducing spread. True, variable since depends antibody levels, last shot, etc. Even previously infected people hosts too, applies. Given SG low infection rate recently, likely unvaxxed never previous infection either, ""fresh"" hosts would far likely symptomatic longer periods body figures mount defense. weirdo downvoted whatever. laughed Yes, optional choice it‚Äôs great! desperately need way never-ending, every single day mask *mandates*.

People choose wear masks often long want, make comfortable you‚Äôre sick, that‚Äôs great! need normalcy choice. Wife (30 37) got Walmart yesterday 3 Moderna Indeed, lot ‚ÄúMake hay shines‚Äù type research studies happening.    
It unique time, regardless immediate benefit many scenarios occurring would difficult replicate post/pre Covid world. forgotten people immunity compromised like people undergoing cancer treatment example.

No, immunocomprimised **contraindication** COVID-19 vaccination.

The vaccine might take well them, still go get shot hopes body produce antibodies/immune response.

My brother law got vaccine midst chemo. I'm sure he's one similar situation. pediatrician good place beginning rollout. Pop clinics big chain pharmacies best bet first weeks. Eventually every doc it, right away. personally think it‚Äôs great US taken mask wearing sick. Across nation, no; expect many different mandates across nation start 2022 school year.   sort confidentiality agreement tell vaxed not

There longstanding precedence employers able require proof certain vaccinations. topic debate, long settled. Bad-faith argument. language indicate mandate. mention, think administration waited full approval mandate adults going jump gun EUA stage young children?

I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre delusional kiddo Yeah surprised getting half dose Moderna since Fauci said JJ 2 dose vaccine  10 microns, bad anti-viral drug. doesn‚Äôt ‚Äòkill‚Äô virus (and many would argue virus living all), inhibits viral replication. So, yes combats viral infection turn reduces severity symptoms.  Well least helpful conspiracy time gets take it.

We able find FDA applications include percentages side effect trial adult one. Page 35 side effect percentages groups. Anyone application kids? OG J&amp;J (pre-pause), boosted Moderna Friday. contributes cost health insurance though. uninsured patients asked pay? Probably 720, still substantially countries. Anyone know what's going Colorado? They're one states seen cases (and hospitalizations) fall last \~2 months. fact, they've seen moderate increases throughout October.

I'm worried they're ""cold weather"" canary coal mine. Love Tim Meadows wonder go 2 years without making penny income disqualify like everyone else.... wait 18 months see lawyer..... getting denial letter appeal another 6 months.... apply again.... Well Congrats covid patients.... eligible disability 2026 17 rejections!!!! know. live Russia.

Most us read reddit though.  Picked Covid 15? BMI overweight higher one higher risk factors (yes, stupid metric). 

Have ADD? Cool, that's neurological condition.

Do hang immune-compromised people? 

At worst, say a/your doc suggested it, they're going verify anything. I'm sure also email PCP, go ""hey, I'd like get thing. problems this?""; say ""nah, go it"", doctor approved. Sounds like trying keep track this. I've given note cards. follow nextstrain.org. also Twitter. Conspiracy theories rampant dissolution USSR. People know decipher different information came end state owned media, suddenly people went one media narrative dozens. Here's deal it. got frustrated messaging early on, decided continue stay cautious side. never stopped masking, Israel started boosting found way get third shot. work around public area masks vaccines often shunned. I'm one people work large retail store caught Covid. Yet. outbreaks summer, plan stay cautious winter. No, wearing face coverings protects around you
from infected. yes, net-positive; you
are infected shedding.

Science say amount cloth going stop 10m particle
from reaching nose (or eyes, open wound). shit messaging caused many issues could avoided, say masks work, said people need high grade manufactured masks due limited supply leave essential personnel, recommended cloth masks said primary function limit spread, impossible gauge masks everyone wearing effective they're essentially wearing diy masks. messaging much harder spread ""they said masks work"". Definitely. People good reason doubt government, Soviet-style information/propaganda finesse it, people could kind sense bullshit, anything it. Add limited information, everyone becomes kind armchair Kremlinologist who, least mind, reflexively rejects government says substitutes kind baroque conspiracy theory. imagine allowed people feel independence/control without getting trouble, would've adaptive circumstances. end whole generation Alex Joneses.

I think true general particularly exacerbated high profile incidents like Chernobyl‚ÄîI'm sure others relevant, can't recall top head.

Source: born 1980s Eastern Europe parents' generation believes Bill Gates trying install 5G microchips arms. Maybe last year, society shut respiratory virus (except Covid) circulation? fully approved ‚Äúalternative‚Äù bit subjective. mean, theory, way EUA guidelines read me, J&amp;J Moderna EUAs revoked instant Pfizer became fully approved available, aren‚Äôt. 

AFAIK, FDA said would review EUA applications except ‚Äúhad prior discussions them‚Äù Novavax one companies believe positive COVID tests sequenced variants, probably nobody knows.

Also, *think* epidemiologists study variants aggregate, information usually flowed individual patients?

*If* coworker knew, violation HIPPA ask yourself. probably know. purpose are, though. Whatever reasons people getting flu shots yearly booster almost certainly reasons people might getting COVID shot. guarantee nobody get flu shot political beliefs.

So whatever happens get either one matter. purpose matter, though, that's comparable biggest misunderstanding among willfully unvaxxed.  way government handled public relations USSR contributed conspiracy theories

That's said plenty them. But, least, actual efforts suppress dissimination, even though secure ideological monopoly, enlightment masses. Germany still mandated FFP2 masks pretty much everywhere, mandated contact tracing, Limits event sizes, limits number people allowed space dependent size venue, possible roll museum buy ticket, must prebought, concerts postponed spring 2023 etc. Scotland mask mandate infection rates similar England mask mandate.

It could everyone still wears shitty cloth masks close nothing. Yes requiring masks vaccinations overkill.

Just require vaccines done it. wants pay money enjoy forced ti wear mask whole time? ruins experience. r/woooosh  Vaccines less weight sensitive traditional drugs, cutoff somewhere, fairly arbitrary right margins... obviously 11y364d year old magically change following day physiologically. luckily vaccine free! fyi, covid death rate (since march 2020) compared types death rates 2019. study assumes 2019 death rates covid period. take whatever want.  Interesting. I'm still confused 3rd dose people half not, sequence laid relation immunocompromised regarding 4 shot regimen makes sense, although masking restaurants indoors either apart indoor rides can't imagine there's much mask wearing. I'm trying figure selfish kids. giving understand that? Doctor Robert Malone?
