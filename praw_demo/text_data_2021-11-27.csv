0,2021-11-27,"  We’ve known quickly mRNA vaccines produced altered least 5 years. It’s part reason they’re amazing. 

Considering timing, almost impactful penicillin. Imagine, vaccines melanoma. fwiw, 11/19, entire population China, 1.076b 76.3% fully vaccinated, 1.225b 86.9% least one dose, 65.73m given booster shot. [Source](http://www.gov.cn/xinwen/2021-11/21/content_5652303.htm) Easier said done, South African government used conduct experiments people sterilised black people. shit haunts trust state general won’t forgotten. reformulate, months access it. want new shot, get then. meantime, get boosted!  study mentions reports.

 There's Nature study showed infected COVID vaccinated afterwards could neutralize SARS distantly related coronaviruses. right, include vaccine only. 

However, also found study shows COVID vaccinated individuals also immunity existing human ""common cold"" coronaviruses. unexpected even distantly related SARS. think, summary, evidence fairly strong existing coronavirus vaccines, perhaps booster near future, provide robust protection known coronaviruses. far know, (note title says Southern Africa, South Africa). even originate there, much already dozens countries across globe. 40 years since efforts get African continent vaccinated MMR vaccine started, still countries Sub-Saharan Western Africa MMR vax rates 50%. 

Of course variety factors play like poor infrastructure, local politics etc made getting people vaxxed challenge, vaccine hesitancy huge part it. 

There's also hesitancy, large, towards covid vaccines new. going huge challenge get people vaxxed, quite frankly continent gets 50% vaxxed next decade I'll absolutely astounded. That's line thinking rather lack thereof lead pandemic. COVID killed thousand times many twentieth time.
So definitely *as* bad, ~20.000 times worse Ebola. Everything post absolute nonsense. Stop fear mongering. get new variants folks vaxxed get infected COVID-19.  That's it, folks. required actually. agree. think boosters goal almost - assuming long term immunity holds wane like first doses. course would ideal could get population vaxxed. problem variants arise populations low vaccine availability/uptake may end threatening us vaxxed too. Ughh naive   Ditto.  Unfortunately virus doesn’t care want. Africa protocol makes moot. See countries wide usage antimalarial antiparasitic drugs see countries low vaccination rate along low deaths covid.  Cannot believe pax tested negative allowed fly final destinations. trapped several hours small holding rooms plane ground (air filters blowing) dozens people tested positive. travel restriction policy complete joke.  approve vaccines children 5 point. Hopefully soon. site awesome... use it? first chart show?  friends recently gotten access private medical care. freely easily available. Oh come on! 

The vaccine manufacturers said technology available adapt mutations virus needs tweak updated vaccine.

Financial markets? job speculate - markets fluctuate time due current events. fluctuating year various COVID related news. 

There conspiracy - responses laughable like anti-vaxx conspiracies. thoughts exactly COVID vaccine offered 3-5 year protection period, I’d agree. J&amp;J vaccine 2-3 months, phizer/Moderna 6-8 months. It’s feasible get zero COVID. Moderna recently started trials pair mRNA HIV vaccines, might far off. 400,000 people tested positive past week. sample want expedite? Heck, pharmacy went never even asked ID. It’s probably hard find people wanna get shots put arms. transmissibility infecting people also means chances mutate another variant. could remain infectious regain lethality.  spike protein heavily mutated part, almost every vaccine designed model spike protein develop immune responses 

if really mild corona, wont know gor least month, also somehow knocks delta, omni could blessing disguise hospitalization rates, world hibernate last couple years

it could also true omni higher incubation/transmission, isnt afforded protection vaccines, high hospitalization rate, true would make delta look like alpha  country turned Iran Democratic county authoritarian one?

Iran monopoly ""mistreat people"". know that? Like obviously doesn’t. don’t think anybody disability deluded enough think people large actually care. Society proves us constantly. enough vaccines, population want them. Yea gotta say … I’m loving name.

“President makes statement Omicron Covid-19…”

it gives solid alien-invasion vibes Forget convincing, that’s easy. It’s country voters swayed free tshirt chocolate bar.

The real core issue pay vaccines countries like SA. problem would Omicron much antigenic distance variants like Delta prior infection Omicron wouldn’t really protect Delta. would like two different diseases.

Would great Omicron turns cold? Yes. Would stop pandemic? Assuming high antigenic distance, maybe not. South Africa need get vaccination rate first identified case Botswana. possible they're better job neighboring countries testing sequencing cases. cat bag already targeted travel bans may economic harm actually preventing transmission. I'd rather see universal requirements get vaccinated tested flying country. Israel may know dangerous 'Omicron' is, think potential incredibly dangerous closed borders today.

Call concerned. God damn it, getting long covid fully vaccinated, heart goes you. long term symptoms severe live less normal it? Logic great, absolutely wonderful, definitely agree. get week instead. whatever charcoal stuff wants get done. varies, understand. Antibodies sort like keys tracker them. function properly right protein, ""lock"", outside virus present. 

The ""keys"" main variants close enough shape antibodies attach fine, Omicron need check see that's still case. isn't, need change vaccine, adding ""keys"" immune system use ID virus. likely need new vaccine ( booster ) delta targeted specific spike protein . 29 different mutated spikes. honesty would considered new strain saying. Mother Nature job one. Good news say it’s less Severe Israel giving boosters citizens anyone else. part reason decided get one early. Low. Morocco may ban connections may become difficult/impossible make. risky risk virus infection higher  Sweet, sweet child, idea many people like that. around us whole time mostly notice them. worked nurse saw people worst story, along political climate last years, suprised slightest. 
I going make assumption you, may wrong, feel like would safe guess say either 30 live south (as southern part u.s.). mean negative way; fact true envy you, awful place live, hard aware things are. Regardless, envy continued faith humanity, least circumstances allowed avoid aware common people like are. would surprising don’t find case US Monday keep thinking Lrrr planet Omicron Persei 8. guess time rewatch Futurama.  crazy uncle gonna get J&amp;J shot month. he's planning take certain stuff like 'charcoal tablets' whatever ""undo"" vaccination ""kill"" him, recommended crazy aunt mine. What's ""logic"" behind this?  Might entirely representative vaccines. since Israel pretty quick gate provide first second doses, isn’t general consensus waning immunity right now? miss something boosters now?  feel way underwear? Come America’s, give vaccine like candy kids! fr think we’re country kinda rlly this..  People would come world see BTS?? never without Lysol. Turn TV. I'm hearing reports variant may intentionally designed manufactured. ""too perfect"" ability evade existing vaccines antibodies. 5 percent population 65 prefer ivermectin bleach personally. Start rooting Covid. become interesting happy thing :) Omicron = Moronic Yep, you’re one. Everyone else entire world full joy thanks Covid. they're authoritarian dictatorship, penchant for, quite literally, welding people inside homes case outbreak?

also, judging handled original spread virus, probably - hear them.  see would happen would revealed clinical trials broader use. They've already trialed another mRNA mixed variant shot I'll effects. yearly flu shot mix three four strains. Pifzer/Moderna send monthly booster subscription box idc jesus. variant around months given genetic diversity far (Prof Balloux). didnt start 2 weeks ago. R0 based 2 weeks misleading. people wait weeks even start calculation, beginning. Also South Africa lowest rate Delta ever week. new variant single superspreader event would dominant case. point lack early pathogenesis. can’t answer beyond COVID tendency start mild turn bad.

Of course, one thing would increase transmissibility would long duration symptoms would cause people crawl bed stay put. I’ve realize feeling bad mechanism protect community. duration extends infinity end illness people stop getting bad symptoms, would great. wouldn’t bet it, would great.

Thanks compliment prior post. done far bit reading scientific papers. also needed find notes post, took effort. Every vaccine risks. that’s fine! accept risks they’re far lower illness itself. 

But say take risks even more. 1/1m 1/2m. Isn’t worth there’s associated cost? could save hundreds even thousand lives. slightly changing procedure. 

Nobody saying vaccines bad. We’re saying make even better. ELI5 mutation mutations? don’t understand works. make google you. evidence obviously conclusive point. Huh? don’t understand context here. authorities? president? It’s  18-34yr age group least vaccinated 21%. country much vaccine stock push back scheduled deliveries. 


Link vaccine status age group province: I’ve heart palpitations Moderna booster related cardiac stuff going since getting . original 2 shots also Moderna, mild side effects that. I’m 2.5 weeks booster, things appear slowly getting better me. think vaccine causes little inflammation immune response. heart pounding away night 1st couple nights booster, things appear getting better. checked today six flights per day Johannesburg Atlanta. It’s here. need toilet paper, toilet paper, toilet paper.

I need prepare worse!!! made variant vaccines testing plain booster gave enough protection really pursue modified vaccine. “Like miracle…it gone…”

It’s never going “gone”. doesn’t exist political reasons. It’s virus. Viruses mutate. Im tired shit. think need extra deadly form virus finally get rid antivax morons.  I'm betting NYC Florida first. know, thanksgiving thing literally places. 

For example, lab UK working flat variants sequences since november 18th, including weekend. Pretty sure can't blame members BTS fulfill contract negotiations management company. US hadn’t pulled infectious disease specialists China probably would caught sooner rang bell instead China hiding economy can't remained closed restrictions forever.

It going away. learn live it. want point mutations make virus concerning.

Some mutations omicron already recognize concerning. many haven’t seen yet, it’s clear. like mutation organism, absolutely nothing, detrimental organism, beneficial. So… knows. I've theory that's completely unbacked data, eventually level mortality flu time goes on, either vaccine efficiency even natural immunity. Perhaps reason deadly novel gets around, even variants, we're getting degree resistance eventually everyone exposed either vaccine targeting spike protein natural infection. Even waning immunity, still b helper cells recognize previous viral infections could still make us sick, may cause degree protection. know.

One theories 1918 flu pandemic deadly younger people older people survived Russian flu pandemic 20 years earlier may degree resistance younger people not. know theories like cytokine storms not. think it’s absolutely valid concern. course it’s important wait data tell us another vaccine needed. whole reason Moderna didn’t roll it’s delta-specific vaccine data told wasn’t significantly better original. may case well, given vast number mutations spike protein RBDs may be. interesting see new vaccine warranted kind dosing needed (are going seeing another 100 mcg dose 50 mcg? something completely different?).

Keep feeling like minutes/hours away first US case announcement. 

I checking Gabby Petito subreddit people obsessed. early know.  
  
Also fully vaccinated Israel means 3 doses many countries still vaccinated 10% population. Nothing end even current vaccines proven effective access improves lot. infectious disease doctor SA put best Twitter saying it’s early reliable data indicators severity variant usually lag behind new cases [thread Twitter. Chinese government pays bot farms  early tell effective R value, plus vaccines change number. best option everyone take super seriously. Utilize precautions learned put place gather/analyze data coming weeks. Thankfully they’re extremely severe, I’m constantly fatigued, bad brain fog, muscle aches, cough won’t go away, heart palpitations. 

Plus can’t anything fatigue caffeine makes heart race now. got moderna booster flu shot time yesterday, feel fine side effects. public health perspective, transmissibility far important. Even severe average, it'll severe people, 10x many people catching disease far worse, terms burden hospital system, disease getting severe.

That’s always true. obvious example common cold, transmissible mild many people barely puts strain healthcare system. matters combination multiple factors producing overall larger impact. 1 single factor means anything others negligible risk. think correct! Also mean polio rampant/before vaccine (I'm 25). Antivax sucks ass Arsonists exactly strike empathetic Someone else already said correct situation, enough consider Im asshole here.

I never said wanted anything sort, projecting extreme degree right now.

Go food, sit genuinely think behaving people. Omg thank lol. I’ll get one make little lab coat ahahah perspective live Ontario right next door Michigan reporting 960 cases today. Michigan 8000 something? 89% 12+ fully vaccinated still wear masks everywhere funeral yesterday. hugging crying folks find haven’t vaccinated. Still find unreal people refuse get shot. 200 close personal gathering likely find way someone’s immune system. mask points hope wasn’t mistake  saying awhile infections rise point vaccinated people conditions turned away due lack hospital beds plan place unvaccinated Covid patients moved palliative wards put heavy painkiller drip ease suffering, additional resources devoted care take anything away vaccinated people need treatment. time/personnel/resources treat absolutely best way possible, take anything away folks got vaccinated so. know correct term is, something like un-prioritize care favor people right thing make make it, not. almost two years patience also quite thin. Hopefully spring get kick-ass therapeutics help cases unvaccinated crew. Yeah, amount fluffy useless noise media overwhelming. Almost way sift msm stuff figure decent information there's much it. get covering story, outlet pushing like two articles hour every hour mostly repetitive uninformative garbage. Really frustrating. Inevitably already think I'd see infected mushroom reference wild lol hear 'omicron' keep thinking huge futurama joke. Glad weeks! Unless multiply speed light squared — case, word energy. time, see Polio 3 variants, can't find info long took evolve moment (on vacation, sorry).

Smallpox time. Polio mounting slow comeback, sadly. *basically* eradicated, pockets remained Middle East anti-vaxx propaganda slowly chipping away immunization rates allowing disease make comeback.

If I'm mistaken, date, smallpox viral disease humanity ever managed completely eradicate. time infections matters, contracted Covid definitely provides level immunity matter variant. 

You’re also considering powers want people vaccinated message vaccinated despite previous infection. want people thinking previous infection gives lifelong long immunity, message inconsistent.

[Immunity previous infection does, many cases, protect people reinfection. occur, illness tends mild. immunity varies significantly person person, many people mount strong, durable immune response protects delta previous infection, may generate weak immune response remain remains rare*

**“We know reinfection common occurrence, least short term original variant virus well variance,” said Dr. Amesh Adalja, senior scholar Johns Hopkins Center Health Security infectious disease expert.

A study Cleveland Clinic tracked cases healthcare workers either vaccinated previously COVID-19 found rate reinfection essentially vaccinated.

Another studyTrusted Source Qatar similarly found chance reinfection similarly low among previously COVID-19 vaccinated.**  makes say that? interesting article gives us glimpse happening South Africa ways always see reported elsewhere. 

One interesting item found article studies show reproduction rate 2 — meaning every person infected likely spread two people.**

My understanding basic reproductive number Delta ranged around 3 8 mean around 5 (although may depend source).

I'm expert reproductive rates general (e.g. number may change time different settings vaccinated versus unvaccinated) - curious reported rate much lower compared Delta yet mutations indicate may transmissible. 

I'm probably missing something experts (or informed persons) want chime I'd appreciate help understanding piece information. think vaccine needs widely available first anyone know sign clinical trials this? that's case, medias great job making governments proactive then. Good them! Hope that's is. people; different backgrounds.

People *fall* conspiracies do-so circumstances lead outcome. behaviours irrational, *unforgiveable*.

But, since right-of-centre politicised vaccines unfortunately left-of-centre counter identity opposing people demonising them.

Don't get wrong, unquestioningly fault unambiguously morally ""evil"" people stoke fires disinformation. yet forgiven bad faith actors intend so. victims conspiracies mostly conspirators, immediately jump ostracising deeper ignorance.

I'm still waiting variant that's bad enough scare people actually get vaccine. Preferably one weak vaccine highly contagious unvaccinated.

Maybe it? Based “arithmetic calculation”, model. Also, paper I’m aware of. massive amount vaccination possibly could stopped this, preventing first place. Rather, assuming partial immune escape would needed enough vaccines around initial case herd immunity snuff managed get started. However, would mean focusing infection spread instead hospitalizations deaths, exact opposite trying handle pandemic would mean boosting keep antibody immunity high. need quarantine hotel, home, 10 days. allowed go essential shopping like food, etc. colleagues Japan who've gone back US 2 3 times past year, big deal.  Lol understand. appreciate take. right, study happens looking. doubt billions viruses kill constantly--but like anything evolve survive. Please, PLEASE light end tunnel. seriously hope another surge again. sure still 2019? wondered many underlying conditions brought forwards recovered old ailment suffering relapse due covid. It’s easy, quarantine millions people daily basis conduct massive testing population… pretty much aware covid. new variant targeting strong healthy people 20s 30s, vastly different scenario faced 2020. know flu took decades stabilizing got way public consciousness right?

Covid going mutating wildly long time makes sense look like flu. Lol bro, hypocrisy astounding. literally started condescending everyone immature. expect? People bow opinion? Something better nothing. 1% case country(quite possible small nations) got spared, want shoot foot allowing people unhindered. means nothing right now. addressing media forced to, media outlets started reporting useless information, releasing headlines concrete info share yet. least me, one relevant factor side effects vaccine.

I'm saying even register minds giving cool name. skip letter give number like delta2.50. returned normal + mask even traveled abroad booster (testing ways course). 

I completely run empathy choose remain unvaccinated point time. wont lose sleep get point hospitals turn away refused vaccine choice. probably matter going happen, when.

This called consequences actions. Im done sacrificing idiots. It’s like saying oxygen works Considering discovered Tuesday, formal announcement Thursday, travel bans enacted Friday, England making masks compulsory Tuesday, safe say something's happening know wanted add: referring top would like Ebola, yes? Like said think we're page, capacity word well lol Not. Vaccinated. say I'm quite happy transparent SA disease detection simple lmao. They've made multiple variant specific vaccines. strain WT vaccine worked well enough tests justify changing vaccines. Dont treat unvaccinated ones. vaccine ready early 2022.

Then FDA CDC dither several months authorize intense need humor appease anti-vaxxers. guess that's one high-risk way get quarantine.  Yeah let's see Joe Rogan thinks let science journalists weigh /s  Delta still seems scarier current data. However, I'm curious hospitalization rate Omicron. I'm getting booster Delta nasty ravaging area. Insofar, care Omicron. Meh let burn through. Started south pushed north. Likely shortly. much stop freight train point. take 3-4 months produce enough cover large chunks population. Production capacity finite.  It’s certainly prevalent media hype Twitter make sadly affects many folks patients get turned away too? larger hospitals accept transfers full? (Asking idea hospitals like Northern Ireland.) see many people mask many protests regarding mandates...wasting time money lives prove stupid point. People going lives things normal. Punching people told mask up. Traveling need to. envy bubble seem live in. magical land? direct flights South Africa US daily, stop even Monday ban non-US citizens whichever southern African countries. almost certainly already here.

The US also pretty bad testing/tracing/sequencing infrastructure compared lot countries, yet discovered cases.

So yeah, almost certainly already here, proof yet. I’ve noticed too. insane misinformation comes Omicron, there's people country's sub claiming vaccines useless variant die tons people upvoting soon positive news appear refuse believe it, people really want covid airborne ebola seems already said did. would think blood would Pfizer’s hands refusing release patent opposed organization could have, best case scenario, sent vaccines continent still capacity independently vaccinate 10% population.

That’s two cents. Production centers India China - let alone Europe - could cranking stupid amounts vaccines patent. Jeez 85% sounds like great statistic someone lives Northern Ireland, hospitals usually run capacity 100% winter I've instinctively since Day 1. know policy lol. notice giving 3rd &amp; 4th doses people still dragging feet, gave cred eyes. think anyone claimed reasonable person probably feels way. Regardless, there's still enough data determine bad is. Well rule super high rates severity small sample size. I've literally never heard anyone.  didn’t say don’t get vaccinated. disputed fact people recovered vaccinated face “very high risk” comparable unvaccinated people. high rate long COVID? EVERYONE got infected gets it? comes “brain fog” brain damage yes seems like it’s gonna entire generations mentally disabled people previously weren’t believe there's one South Africa though, personally know vaccinate county like (or countries southern Africa).

I feel like G20 Deltaplan realistic way get project like done. I'm inclined put blame there. admit bit glib. 

Self reported medical surveys run amateurs interpreted click hungry reporters without medical expertise less useless tell nothing except people's feelings. Six months recommendation. That's precisely did. 6 half months climbing steadily past 2 weeks. long ago like, 300? military already system this. refuse get dishonorably discharged failing follow orders. Yes I've seen news articles calling worst variant every, headlines saying escape vaccines, transmissible ever, could back square one etc 

Sure scientists rational media world day milking clicks going fear anxiety. someone living south, say, “most” people not. Bc chips used vaccines! kidding... says NEW VACCINE NECESSARY

MVP. Giving real non sensational news. coronavirus first broke around globe Redditors concerned hit Africa India. spread throughout world seemed like countries spared, developed/rich countries' number spiked. course Delta eventually spring India, later on. weird South Africa new variant pops up. Like first line time. India lot young people, southern countries Africa well? Younger/healthier populations challenge virus infect spread, especially vaccinated. Maybe forced mutate? isn’t true. Source: pharmacist Wrong vaccine 😂  killing host propagate another organism evolutionary disadvantage. 100% I’m one lucky ones guess… times yard work days following vaccines booster .. never even knew took 🤷‍♂️ Thank do. Antigen tests also unmatched deployability speed. run hundreds fraction time would take run hundred PCR samples. 

Make mistake, personally opt, recommend, PCRs available. say PCRs still ""gold standard"" testing. antigen tests place arsenal hospitals USA use everyone comes via ER screening tool. u/pos1tivity pointed out, antigen tests great showing someone contiguous. 

Losing tool, said, would major blow probably lead testing backlogs people move away rapid tests PCRs. hope case, trying explain useful rapid tests been. info? laugh. 

The viral strain currently cultivated rapidly several leading laboratories around world enough volume start testing existing vaccines it. genome published last week. labs, eg several SA, California UK, expecting 2-4 weeks process occur begin comment conclusive results. comments speculative stage. 

The current consensus scientific community yes probably demonstrate vaccine resistance infectious , based quantity base mutations spike protein compared previous strains (of note, double delta has). mutations equal though. several particular concern Omicron - 3 mutations associated receptor site spike protein impacts efficiently antibodies recognise it, known colloquially type 1,2,3. Alpha one mutated away original Wuhan strain, consequently demonstrated tangible impact ones natural immune system slight impact vaccinated immune systems. 

Omicron appears 3 sites mutated. 

Without sound scientific data available yet, governments apply cautionary approach simply rely public data associated rate spread, infection levels disease severity. stage it’s pretty hard draw anything concrete either, say appears spreading fast infecting vaccinated people frequently. Mass surveillance testing needed remove sampling bias, still high right now. 

From genealogical perspective, based mutations alone, hallmarks somthing significant immediately elevated variant concern seeing even conservative governments blocking flight routes Africa regions. Yeah we’ve got thousands white tailed deer testing positive. That’s great. kids got second shot weekend, go? side effects? kid none (slightly sore arm) first dose.  receptor target via mutation

essentially impossible.  worry man. honestly rare enough, easily diagnosed treatable enough probably lose much sleep it. Israel’s fantastic public health while. It’s also, you’d expect, totally different part government parts tend get heavily criticized (military, infrastructure, housing policy etc) know one person least 20 COVID past two weeks vaccinated. people became eligible boosters last week. one unvaccinated one vaccinated person sicker rest recovered.

Ooooo scary words mate. Still taking vaccine lol They’re probably also drawing information countries. Let’s What? Never heard lmao  easter 2020 That’s good fair question. It’s mostly lab observation literature plus reported mutations lineage designation ticket N-Terminal Domain, McCarthy et al Omicron deletions three four Recurrent Deletion Regions, although RDR 3 around 211 admittedly also adjacent insertion. effect unknown, least RDR 1 RDR 2 present.

For Receptor Binding Domain, also Liu et al preprint Yes , know it’s preprint, also fog-of-war scenario. information value lower non-zero. also note Omicron missing L452R, N440K instead N439K, E484A instead E484K. particular statement Liu et al’s introduction: “Most SARS-CoV-2 variants acquired mutations neutralizing antibody epitopes RBD, resulting escape neutralizing antibodies (Cele et al., 2021; Collier et al., 2021; Davies et al., 2021; Madhi et al., 2021; Planas et al., 2021a; Tegally et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021a).” I’m giving weight several citations *have* passed peer review.

Then also reports drops cross-variant convalescent serum like Liu et al’s peer reviewed Gamma especially Beta convalescent serum neutralizing drop Delta Planas et al peer reviewed study investigating neutralization Delta D614G, Alpha, Beta convalescent serum well Pfizer AstraZeneca vaccine serum ); Uriu et al letter showing reduced neutralization Mu early-pandemic convalescent serum Pfizer vaccine serum even relative Beta Pan et al’s peer reviewed study cross-variant convalescent serum neutralization mention demonstrate potential loss neutralization due mutations.

This exhausting…. Ok hear problem pharmaceutical companies didn’t get rich saving world. got rich exploiting millions sick people, opioid crisis exorbitant insulin prices. I’d like think maintain ability save people’s lives without endure much medical fraud. Yes, Bezos King. inb4 TP jokes Negative flying, positive landing. 500+ “negative” cases since released wild despite close proximity several hours smh. relevant now, since there's significant cluster mid/high-level European footballers come severe cardiac issues past couple weeks.   also could mean variant deadly. was, would increased number cases deaths significantly. Ask they’re convinced don’t want convinced, evidence pretty damn clear cut. IRL data Pfizer’s presentation FDA. pages around 15 show massive gains age groups. don't. Perhaps rare never happened anybody twice.

There vectored (outside US/EU) inactivated vaccines. ""weaker"", vectored (J&amp;J) still makes perfectly good booster. Inactivated much weaker, next side effects. Neither causes myocarditis.

Assuming US, I'd get J&amp;J booster.   countries close borders non essential travel. Period. Dr Coetzee, briefing African medical associations Saturday, made clear patients healthy worried new variant could still hit older people – co-morbidities diabetes heart disease – much harder.

“What worry older, unvaccinated people infected new variant, vaccinated, going see many people severe [form the] disease,” said.

&amp;nbsp;

Thank sharing Telegraph article. It’s early let guard down. ignore context South Africa low vaccine uptake low delta numbers. taken account, know sure. wait see next week. hope true premature anecdotal evidence. remember seeing certain people trying downplay Delta weaker version Alpha started spread within US, Delta overwhelm hospitals kill scores people. injecting millions people, near-certainty something ""extremely unlikely"" happen eventually.

If aspirating takes risk 0.01% 0%, that's big difference.  test needs taken end day 2. book day 2 test airport testing center right arrival. Lateral flow test results ready within hour. 20% increase small increase? ""we know weeks"" combined ""nothing likely fundamentally change"" accurate headlines. like popular vaccines it’s best get twice year. Lethality hosts directly matter them, provided still able transmit. said, ideally virus's perspective, get infected, never fight off, spread end days. Considering uncomfortably large chunk DNA viral, entirely possible numerous viruses already ""won"" regard.

In humans particular, severe virus is, harder we're going quarantine infected, applying selection pressures less severe strains emerge. actually really appreciate this. think weird people believe doctors vaccines, listen doctors treat cancer, hypertension, diabetes, etc. Like believe doctor moron vaccine moron everything else?

So good rural midwest guy. there’s really evidence primarily race based. it’s “infrastructure” issue &amp; “decision making” issue. infrastructure likely go &amp; harder get back poorer areas b/c they’re often older. (this systemic racism might come doesn’t mean decisions made *during* outage racist) 

as far decision making goes, different cities prioritize different areas prioritize areas high tourist traffic essential/important businesses &amp; work get online next. 

like, instance article ~ Monkey Junction clearly business heavy area, it’s going prioritized &amp; likely updated infrastructure. live area likely gonna back too, b/c they’re prob grid

then, showing Shacory Blanks (our black protagonist) sick food given red cross, pan “Peggy White” whole foods. never show assume she’s white. she’s eating mac cheese lives near MJ. she’s obviously supposed privileged contrast *her power also still out*…the difference Peggy White money whole foods. 

i see guy feels weird portrayal city, going around interviewing black folk power (when there’s clearly white folks too) paint city racist. also feels vaguely trauma-porny me. 

if think power company city officials Austin playing race based favorites comes power outages that’s something def. confront about. I'm pretty sure FDA can't multitask. believe ones got mild symptoms reported about, actually mostly even vaccinated. I’m sure. heart doctor said based last reaction super bummer.

Do source chance independent?

I’d love find way get booster day. COVID never going away. It’s endemic pretty much forever. 

You’ll keep vaccinating looking forward newer vaccines time. Really symptoms progression any. Challenge f\*cker true vaccinated blood sera ASAP....  Emphasis ""should"". thought delta variant supposed soooo bad. Funny every time people start move covid new variant happens appear, supposedly much worse. am…hoping Doctor Even so, they’d still need record report it. Markets forward looking - expect choppy sessions next week uncertainty grips economists.

VXX absolutely go nuts.

I’m buying LEAPS days 1-2 years out.

We fine. feel satisfied done share fight. feel need step absolutely shame guilt it. done part some. released information stating cases point mild believe vaccines still working it.

No haven't. One doctor gave anecdotal experience dealing around 20 patients, mostly young healthy injected.  That's nearly claiming. choose risks. One risks keep pandemic running running running … longer runs, older I'll time I'll infected. kid situation: 17 year old grocery store employee high school senior, vaccinated April would like booster one available them. guess we'll see gets approved turn 18 spring.   point I’d absolutely shocked wasn’t. Here’s hoping confirm vaccinated people still least mostly safe.  Thanks. agree you. New England Journal Medicine: [SARS-CoV-2 Variants Patients always get hopes cases rise don’t see hospitalization rise. hospitalization rise get hopes deaths don’t rise. deaths rise back started. 

Let’s assume it’s going deadly, react appropriately cautiously, pleasantly surprised doesn’t follow trend last waves. 

COVID fatigue real though. I’m guessing screwed.   kind get? Perhaps allergic ingredient one vaccine other; e.g. got Pfizer/Moderna J&amp;J safe, issue. first case reported 9 November. first case found, maybe already spreading asymptomatically longer time.  Aw bless sweet soul think we'll last long enough species, much less country, affected maximum detriment climate change. bet Colorado haha  Huh? give 👍to dad. Sure speculation there's overwhelming data support theory limited extent, yes.

But anyone somewhat functional immune system (even they're old frail) eliminate virus within weeks\*, virus get chance mutate much one did. might create one two mutations, dozens.

\*even people die virus usually eliminated bodies beforehand; physical damage infection immune response kills entirely useless! throw possibly help.

I specific projects suggest Covid specific, bunch covid research various medical projects start pandemic (and there's always continuing need scientists number crunching).

Also computer gets warm enough double space heater winter great. govs know aren’t telling us yet? 4 weeks lag might enough time get EUA one two new therapeutics finishing trials get started distribution hospitals. Also enough time see it’s “worst case scenario” actually merits much greater intervention serious lockdowns/tracing internally widely dispersed. There's reason VOCs huge number spike protein mutations, vaccines back then. vaccines target spike protein part proteins distraction.

What completely fails Omicron measuring antibody levels, antibody neutralization Omicron theoretically next zero. Perhaps N antibodies could something here, seems unlikely really inefficient even possible. needed B cells recognize new spike protein adjust within days, almost studies actually measure those. saying analogous literally stopping driving.

Our immune system evolved anticipate variants. Memory B-cells produce antibodies slight “variations theme” encounter virus. deployed primary antibody best fit. companies working vaccines

10s ass probably 10 dominating respective regions much likely get covid. again, upside. idea heavily downvoted.  long Delta Rewards program max variant we're good! Studying surge, scientists identified new variant diagnostic tests indicate likely responsible many 90% new cases,

First detected November 12th infected 90% population November 27th? Either detected late spreads like crazy. like New Vienna. Old Vienna getting boring. state forcing people injected substance want body? 

I cannot see would compatible Grundgesetz, much would prefer everyone vaccinated. Bundle vinyl lumberjack flannel. Mate info far vaccines still working it, symptomatic (even unvaccinated) extremely mild cases

Stop scare mongering one anywhere go money anyways, there's lot cash sidelines waiting dip. Monday gonna flat, Friday new all-time-high.  maybe simple precaution. know much short time. big deal, open borders quickly.     I'm going lockdown people dumb get vaccinated. get you’re saying. really focused saving every penny made “the future” guy knew dropped dead 50. Really makes think. saying I’m irresponsible cash now, try balance plans future also enjoying moment. 

And yeah, every time go car there’s risk others, wear seatbelt drive speed limit (mostly), think balance risk applies COVID situation also. 

“It’s dangerous business Frodo, going front door.” message changed ""end times"" ""we know"" news infected little symptoms.  That’s you’re probably already morons!
If first detected South Africa it’s probably everywhere already. think one constant lose effectiveness time  cripes that's still low proofreading abilities pretty common DNA viruses like smallpox polio, thats slow enough mutate able practically eradicate them.

SARS-2 rarity highly transmissible RNA virus proofreading ability, makes stable RNA viruses like Influenza family, still able mutate significantly seemingly quicker pace (but stable, drastic mutations) due contagious giving opportunity mutate every new cell infects. Nature weeding idiots thousands everyday. big foot variant?  can’t wait ZuluEpsilonBravo variant 1024 mutations 2022 wonder many fake variants named world revolts governments What? I'm spreading panic misinformation. I'm pretending going according plan. 

The vaccine also made prevent infection. (Otherwise things like Vaccinated / Tested / Recovered - entry regulations make absolutely sense. current delta wave see regulations rendered ineffective new variants Vaccinated people infectios unvaccinated. Therefore obligatory masks back.) would effective alpha variant. delta hand breakthrough cases even rare, expected. may well vaccine even less effective omicron less dangerous, wich makes sense viral standpoint, since virus survives longer kill host.
I'm saying render vaccine ineffective would indeed unlikely, even less effective transmission likely.
And sorry anyone panics almost 2 years headlines like taken virus serious enough first place. work art gallery closed since beginning till two months ago. started business lots Americans came. sure what’s gonna happen now. businesses idea would guess yes. Right? Like issue people packing stadiums concerts going bars whatever. get damn vaccine wear mask. lol I’m living life everything fine.... I’m going live life fear, die tomorrow accident, nothing promised, fo live fear everytime get car? I’m taking seriously Boris Johnson taking seriously. 

Boris Johnson gives fucks anything wouldn’t reintroduce masks upset foaming-at-the-mouth lunatics among voters (not saying them) mention corporate pals. he’s cautious, must’ve told could get bad. Love positivity. Look that's got humanity. 

I've shot predicting another mutation , ya know go ahead mock. assume others work, version spread easier mutate again, possibly another deadly variety. can't prove vaccine already disseminated, obviously. 

The way check hit vein aspirate. Even hit vein 1/5,000 times, that's still alot vaccinating hundreds millions people. likely higher rate that. nurse given thousands injections drawn blood twice. mitigate risk simply aspirating, they've recommended downside it, eliminates risk accidental intravenous injection. Welp, brace mandates lockdowns. can't wait daddy government push little head dirt thumb. work 70 hours week I'm still trying keep head water. 

I'm vaccinated guys piss off. making claim. get covid twice, it’s usually worse second time around? didn’t know that. currently getting first time covid, makes little bit concerned there’s data indicates that’s occurs. got vaccinated back May J J vaccine (so likely strong immunity going this). young otherwise quite healthy/fit person. 

The one thing say concerns illness, shortness breath I’ve experiencing. first day symptoms, 10 days ago, pass simply walking stairs. still trouble even running around playing dog 30 seconds. I’m really hoping second time around (which expect happen point given trajectory pandemic) worse first. Waiting Chupacabra variant Keep head sand. Hide truth forfeit spine. make sick Key word 'suggests'.  way man made vaccine superior natural immunity.  God intended intended way. Besides took THREE shots.

Vaccines work. Exactly 

Some countries never stopped  husband severe myocarditis pfizer. doctors sure (I still believe there's official guidance, unless change last week two...?), suggested take J&amp;J instead mRNA vaccines. got boosters week half ago, issues (he get sick, heart issues).

Basically everyone around never stopped washing hands discovered helps various diseases. made changes border, said possible depending emerging data. reported first case virus is, people seem forget, first REPORTED case. first actual case likely came much sooner. widely-shared quote South African doctor, saying Omicron causes mild symptoms, taken context. referring small group young, healthy people warned severe disease groups.

This whole thing sux... but, focused gratitude... seeing positives. Even means sifting ashes find gems can’t believe live time people prefer get sick, prevent it. two AZ shots Pfizer booster. First shot floored 24, hours, second gave mild headache muscle ache, third (booster) almost nothing, maybe slighlty raised temperature couple hours. Don’t worry 👍 Likely year two, possibly long decade more. Spacing doses improves response saw Canada UK. middle pandemic, would likely done 6 months first second dose standard.

That said, likely annual boosters like flu (and possibly combo shots) targeted prevalent dangerous variants concern Weasel words one way say something without actually saying it, guess. “Close barn door! horses escaped!” know less severe yet. 1) media trying keep people panicking stuff laughable. Even anti-lockdown anti-vax news sources want panicking something else different article

2) decreased efficacy increased lethality possible. still effect vulnerable immune systems aren’t primed majority people vaccines/ boosters

3) complete non-issue get regular “combined” vaccines multiple strains like flu. Something majorly escaping OG vaccine? Highly unlikely is. Something majorly escaping OG + Delta + Omicron vaccine?

Even though describes mRNA ""microencapsulated RNA vaccine"", clear mean nanoparticle mRNA (messenger RNA) vaccine. Maybe, maybe not.

that said obviously real prevalent enough warrant continued boosters effective/proper mask usage way keep completely safe hermit. means cannot see anyone including double triple vaxxed family members unless quarantining you.

Basically anecdotal evidence time arguably biased sources vaccinated likely experience symptoms different common cold extremely mild flu unlikely go hospital die.

Huge risks might bit overstatement. initial part process probably cost millions dollars, huge risk. follow steps (e.g., Phase 2 testing manufacturing set up) cost real money done mRNA vaccine proving successful.

But I've doubt Kariko whip basis vaccine responsive Omicron modifying initial mRNA vaccines. given plans, Moderna Pfizer make vaccine plans, similar 2020. Think like cold flu. Scientifically speaking, viruses evolve adapt able transmit better. typically means become less severe symptomatically damage/kill host (what causing said virus identified spread--aka bad virus). So, adapts transmissible, harder bodies identify OG, realistically better us overall becomes ""common/regular"" disease little true harm.   know everyone “took risk”. People infected well vaccines came along. Yeah. People tired. lived normal life almost two years now. impossible ensure another lockdown. assume experts know two years running, would hesitant announce ""cases mild"" people going end getting severely sick die day's time.

Like honestly, us bunch chucklefucks truly understand virology epidemiology. Tell you’re vaxxed without telling you’re vaxxed. That's theorized common evolutionary path viruses.

*sigh* also curious, looked bit. fully cleared everything, [this best found. best TLDR summary give virus type (Corona, Pox, Influenza, Retro, etc) animal, ""pros cons"". prone mutations, others aren't. Smallpox less prone, infect humans.

Antibiotic treated diseases tuberculosis bacteria rather virus, that's apple oranges. condescending real life too? :/ *looks government response around world* think safe say things kept general public. England reinstating masks Tuesday, week variant discovered I’ve always bothered specifics mutation evolution described. 

The virus doesn’t mutate order become transmissible infect hosts. makes mutation sound like conscious thing virus choosing do. Instead, virus mutates, transmissible mutation becomes, likely spread become dominant variant. 

I totally understand semantics, I’m tired hearing people describe giraffes Africa deciding longer necks able reach taller trees, sounds silly.  That's shame. 

Well, anyway... becomes endemic it’s serious yeah that’s bad, rn it’s still clogging hospitals taking toll people get it. I’m little less hopeful variant less severe, already see young people admitted hospitals. think major miscommunication one transmissibility immune evasion. something evade immunity...isn't transmissible? agree everything said feel like trying say lol. took delta 3 weeks spread 53 countries. 

We third week since Omicron discovered already wide spread.

We also confirmed cases Denmark No. US standard all. states/cities mandate all, public transport. I'm NY public transport mandate. Whitmer stripped emergency health powers… I’m Ohio, thing happened DeWine. It’s damn shame politics took precedence public health. sterile society one want part Yeah.

PCR test something missing? sequencing exact ""proof""? patients referring also come age group less likely hospitalized severe symptoms COVID previous variant. news released south Africa. 65% patients hospitalised unvaccinated, ""most rest"" half vaccinated. course recent reports anecdotal, make sense coming Israel SA.

I think things get interesting. Many unvaccinated people going die, whilst vaccinated people not. already happens, could become amplified. Oh come on! say flu, talking super flu, referring regular flu. 

If not, clear. Word matter dangerous children you’d see stampede clinics. don’t mess people’s kids. stands now, COVID less deadly kids, can’t see vax rates going much higher 25% children. least US.

.heart attacks , strokes, traumas ..still happen. actually county, done since May Hey guy, need attitude. already stated know get deadly. many quoted literally something taught. exceptions everything,and already stated: yes, course right incubation meaning bad scenario. also thread country monitoring cases. anything go weeks. I, like many others, trying hopeful given. areas extremely low vaccine uptake doesn’t actually tell much want hear. 

I find news extremely concerning, considering widespread seems be. Exactly right point, also part lot peoples missed detrimental effects body damaged organs sometime irreversible. doesn’t kill you, long covid effect damages organ erode quality life.  Look, two extremes, doom nothing real. options like ""usually right"" ""sorta wrong"". Either prescribe one side fuck everything else. /s anyone know sign participant clinical trials this? Scientifically speaking, viruses evolve adapt able transmit better. typically means become less severe symptomatically damage/kill host 

No. avirulence hypothesis proven wrong 90s. Higher levels transmission actually linked higher levels virulence, generally via factors like in-host replication rate. observed delta -- transmissible, in-host replication, death.

Immune evasion may force virus evolve become less transmissible / less virulent trade virus forced evolve mutate epitopes recognized immune system, result may become less effective. allows virus spread via reinfection/breakthroughs, may come cost overall fitness virus.

But major factor virulence adaptation human immune system. Immune evasion neutralizing antibodies much easier virus compared immune evasion T-cells, likely possible all. T-cells can't stop infection since detect already infected cells, prevent severe disease death.  someone T-cells recognize SARS-CoV-2 evolution human immune system render virus much less lethal, matter virus mutates. believe case too. Unfortunately upon landing retesting 10 percent Amsterdam flight SA came back positive Friday taking Monday sequence confirm strain(s). Apparently US retesting required upon landing.

Plus people get free Uber rides vaccination sites. 24% fully vaccinated. Lots misinformation around here. 

Not sure countries since two variants SA I'd say focus here.  ""About 65% unvaccinated rest half vaccinated"".

Good news true.  think even know hypocrisy lol Pearl Harbor Day came week early year. least couple years gear arsenal.  first we’re hearing hospitalizations getting worse young people SA right?

I feel like I’ve reading opposite, Omicron far hasn’t shown hospitalizations much.  Japan tested positive option staying hospital quarantine hotel wanted. say ivermectin shot.   “About 65% vaccinated rest half-vaccinated,” said Mathivha. glaring headline, doesn’t tell whole story.  Lol…

Hypocrisy funny. versus variant asymptomatic year, die 4 weeks later. year later. die natural death many years later virus lives body. virus still needs host - longer host lives, better. Yes. pretty much anywhere buy result want presumably tests correct. Transmissibility severity symptoms linked together like skill tree. I’m sick seeing thrown around. virus evolves transmissible mean also becomes less severe. easily evolve deadly transmissible. virus isn’t sentient. evolutions random. doesn’t want anything. long incubation period means severity symptoms transmissibility affect virus spreads. Maybe equate health money. Less others, them. know downvoted - saying makes sense. 

We slightly similar situation live (Oregon). still indoor mask mandate people argue lifting keep saying ""But lift it, cases go up."" I'm like yes, absolutely true, guess what? Unless plan keep us wearing masks COVID eradicated (which never happen), always true.  logical argument lifting mandate. 800k preventable deaths? Lol ok would prevent ICU's overwhelmed? hospitals full covid patients affects require urgent non-covid related care adds even delays waiting low priority operations.  snapshots based patients completely useless confuse people. 

We GP saying people getting mildly ill [ICU doc saying making healthy young people Why? they're looking groups couple people biased various ways.

We reliable data couple weeks seems unhelpful speculate.  can't imagine becoming severe already...unless kills outright. suggest look virology evolution systems misinformed attributing weight lockdowns/preventative measures major selection pressures. 

This viruses work case since humans knew viruses. pandemic becomes endemic virus evolves mild form less virulent contagious. happens contagious variants systemic function quickly crowd variants even slight increase contagiousness. true virulence opposite direction. Small decreases contagiousness result people dying maximal transmission selection pressure deadliness. Idk, say shit like ""don't say anything disagreeing opinion"" expected taken seriously? even understand concept social media free speech? naive gotta think everyone think way certain matter say anything all? 

It's reasonable skeptical seriousness new variant considering amount hysteria surrounded delta variant amounted nothing covid's already past years. new variant nothing another vaccine need take months mark words Worst case scenario 3-4 month lockdowns available widely. Bathing western privilege.

We need vaccine cover variants eventually. Thanks added info! appreciate it! know I'm one quoting oni hope read it. know people apolitical simply bother. think threat minimal, rarely even seem think Covid. group know recently caught it, know one casually showed work ill.  think Covid taught us both. probably test antibodies non-spike proteins.

That way people really covid test positively.  mean, yes would WAY better. referring basically ebola major virus developed vaccines (smallpox, polio). problem moved way past able side end (halting spread much mutation) vaccine rollout planetwide lagged still buttload people unvaxxed. that. want sit ass nothing two weeks again. productive member society makes feel much better watching Netflix day...  think case. 
Have heard B.1.640? recent variant emerged, high number spike mutations, believed undersequenecd African country. led outbreak France, couple weeks appeared rapidly various countries -- speculation would made VOC (tbh still might be. Allegedly discussing today along Omicron)  
But level concern nearly high Omicron. Well put, attend do, peace. Life always constant - change. 5 hours yesterday  know, besides that, get even 1% people taking potentially many saved lives prevention deteriorated quality life, worth it.

It's mostly frustration loss faith humanity talking. Oh no... hubris. :( downsides risks getting multiple boosters? Say, every 4 months rather 6? simply effective? country?   literally evidence vaccines effective variant. 

That's completely irrelevent. question is, ""Might Omicron evade immunity?"" answer is, ""According know, yes."" infectious mild variant overtook Delta want become dominate variant right? I’ll think get toilet paper degree competition determined degree cross-immunity. virus mutates sufficiently cross-immunity, everyone fresh meat perspective mutated virus. Omicron could conceivably become dominant without outcompeting delta. Great car analogy, like use argue sides. seatbelts air bags protect enough protection relax restrictions drunk driving? drunk driver personal freedoms drive without seatbelt extra beer hand. he/she personal responsibility protect others he/she continue living good life driving around however deemed acceptable his/her definition normal is?
But yes, definitely get third shot(wear helmet) others can't trusted right thing reduce chances spreading.  cases tinnitus fade significantly dissapear time, causes like stress, TMJ/neck issues, ear damage loud noises. time frame tinnitus healing lot longer injuries, worry hard 3 weeks.

The good news beginning absolute worst. tinnitus often worsens response stress feedback loop brain. tinnitus heard everything shower, quality life back pre-tinnitus, whereas convinced life first got it. 

Brain neuroplasticity way powerful think, point sound becomes like feeling clothes skin. Technically always present, 'filter' conscious perception automatically net 0 life.

Not mention Susan Shore device treatments pipe line, covid emphasized need tinnitus treatments.

All best, hope helps! right theory though.

They used variolation back day less damaging cowpox immunize smallpox. Similar enough disease body even partial immunity cowpox helped lessen weaken actual smallpox infection one get it.

It's _very_ likely disease similar enough still current vaccines give sort protection. And, concept, getting infected less virulent strain covid-19, also similarly protected delta intense strains level. Dutch make it, seems like similair Delta, infectious. (young) healthy vaccinated probably doesnt affect much. unvaccinated still highly risk.

But scientist much educated it, seems like good summary read far Got it. Thanks explaining Clearly facetious post dude. I’m aware wouldn’t work well. time booster anyway. chances Omicron mutating US variant line comes Ro rate 15 higher? seems great situation holiday season. saw too, found article reuters said this:

""A spokesperson KLM, Dutch arm Air France (AIRF.PA), said passengers flight either tested negative shown proof vaccination getting planes Cape Town Johannesburg."" 

Note say vaccination test. says vaccination test. lol ok. NOONE else saying (except one largest news agencies recognized public health officials). cause don’t like them, doesn’t mean isn’t true. 

Anyway, obviously waste time discussing further. You’ve shown proof. refuse believe, big deal. course, none matters anyway.

Have good one! surgery supposed happen last year still happened. Thanks Covidiots. Ugh I’m sorry hear. huge issue Us. heard Build Better Back bill would limit insulin $35 passes. lot people don’t realize insulin’s aren’t (like Walmart’s). exactly waiting get vaxxed right now, development early situation still turbulent. Global stock markets various governments jumping straight extreme lockdown measures.

Lots people panicking guise caution. fucking loathe virus! I’m even scared feeling ill it, I’m terrified havoc wrecks body fact! thing monster 😢   saw Fauci news morning. speaks like scientist. general public doesn’t understand science. “mights” “shoulds” get misconstrued “will”. media clamps soundbite. 

He needs clearly state “we don’t know much variant yet. meantime get booster. tell details clear answer. Proceed caution.” says then, needs say again.

The lack clarity messaging/reporting awful!  Personifying virus engaging ultimately conveys meaning long ascribed ""motivations"" correct. virus aggregate may well ""decide"" consciously neural nets do. “Think much time would wasted bringing mail door door, instead people line get it.” 

It would work fine. Deploy people neighborhoods.  tad soon make claim? Omicron discovered within last week &amp; found people flights days ago, right? want wait least verified Omicron cases comb making claims either way severity Omicron vaxed person? Hopefully, true Omicron big deal vaxed person. Who’s panicking? Good job recognising it’s harming though. read doom gloom, it’s wonder it’s brain think about. There’s balance need find informed becoming overwhelmed much information. are. 

Is something think pharma companies differently? complaining?

No worries complaining. I'm curious whether implication there. fcked one study. addition several studies article, others including [a 2.5 million person study demonstrating strength natural fact outlier.

What's horrible making unsubstantiated claims assumptions like keep doing. lot think ""opinion"" opinion context scientific process. Quantifying qualifying research data require specific scientific methods; established scientific steps need follow order appropriate analyze information reach scientific conclusions.

I'm criticizing blaming understanding appropriately contextualize data keep presenting scientific process. average person understand established scientific methods. frustrated politicians like DeSantis exploit vulnerability average person comes general lack understanding interpret research data. People like keep telling drawing scientific conclusions follow established scientific methods difference opinion. not. flawed approach making research based conclusions. unreasonable try work. want stop variant coming need close borders, full stop. targeting southern Africa means Omicron goes North Africa first, comes in. Hell could hop India week.

It's basically political theatre make look though something done.  Amazing thanks information. One news station literally spams contradicting articles bias information (all media outlets that), another fauci, need go whats wrong him. You’re right buddy, majority population, politicians, media, saying thing vaccine passports, travel work mandates, endless cycle vaccine. I’m bubble. Welp, get ready lockdowns boys done well areas UK didnt remove mask restrictions. hey masks work right /s Ugh. 

Yelling, singing, vaping, smoking produces highest aerosol concentrations, risks infection. goes manipulation patients, e.g. get tubes throat laid stomach. Even morticians cautious moving covid dead.

Its unfortunate hear inlaws behave unreasonable. house afterall right, irresponsable behaviour guest. wanna take fight challenge vaccination status guides: useful though, long aware limitations- used time studies. Covid also takes week two develop severe point anyhow. Seems like won’t really solid conclusion couple weeks get proper sample size understanding develops. Unbelievable. insane state going almost entirely preventable due politics people choosing get sick die. never make sense me. wish good luck. dont even know working yet lol. guess still can't hurt prepared, head I'm wondering know current vax gonna work.  Idk seem mostly fine coming 2022. 

The closest got “collapse” March/April 2020 NYC area. I’m suggesting healthcare workers aren’t beyond fed dealing antivaxxer morons don’t see Covid truly overrunning healthcare systems ever again. please one local news articles ICU Idaho full. That's good general rule apply sars-cov2. asymptomatic spread infectious-before-symptom onset allows become extremely deadly transmissable simultaneously. question whether novel variants outcompete last ones. live Toronto I'm exaggerating say based observations least 99% people them. exceptions like restaurants obviously drinking public transit, mall, anywhere indoors eating drinking people wear them. got something similar return October 2021. Good know. Thanks.  true evade vaccines stopped Next Generation vaccines protein subunit live attenuated. market right vaccine stop protein subunit Cuban Soberana 02 imported United States provided trade embargo lifted. they're saying ""new"" covid variant basically ones big fear mongering fest nothing one struggling reading

Fauci says here.  
Fauci says found it.  
That means system broken. Why, high blood pressure cholesterol? US-- Work ER doc-

Been vaccinated Booster - rapid HR loss taste smell , Im dizzy exhausted.

Im pretty sure OMICRON !

If catch covid / variant likey catch.

Enjoy 25 valent currently pipeline... Really? variant mutated something like 30 genes spike protein. Basically, lets B-Cells become X-Men, mutants stop bad mutants.

Get boosters. really quite absurd observe here. Protection virus seem robust mRNA counterparts. CDC recommends booster JJ shot soon two months since last shot.  immunocompromised take extra precautions, already doing... couple close family members category well, get it. 

The issue going stuck pandemic mindset trying reduce risk near zero -- evidenced sentiment towards risk posed young children. get panicked whenever kids car, travel leisure accept risk? wear helmet car reduce threat?  Yeah, agree take. gf booked cruise back may that’s taking place late December. We’ve received boosters see reason cancel. headline quite anti vax reflective article  Fauci stupid something? Even dumbass would know already since long. 89% 12+ fully vaccinated still wear masks everywhere

Michigan man here.

I work retail grocer say yesterday smattering people wearing masks shopping indoors. spent better part thanksgiving resting effects booster. Things bad here. Damn, catch break soon ??! feel that, unfortunately much world still *involuntarily* unvaccinated. Perhaps it’s selfish wealthy western nations close travel, sensible nations everybody gotten opportunity get vaccine. We’ve seen two weeks make big difference time used well. say like someone trusts official tallies…. make zero sense, go rambling making irrational claims. probably sentiment Delta made appearance too, would care millions dead globally. People like reason virus keeps propagating thousands keep dying daily. Feel ashamed, problem here. COVID kills lower percentage infected way people world infect – that’s might end killing similar amounts people Reconfigure mRNA vaccine Omicron plasma test

this sounds like comments git checkin Yeah no, duty care. time seem like symptoms, headache go away Tylenol extra tired. 

My partner congested. made take test first see COVID. Came back positive immediately. 

I'm vaccinated Moderna partner vaccinated Pfizer, helps. around 6 months second dose. 

I'm sorry cost issue PCR. state-run sites near you? community run free tests? states, pharmacies like Walgreens also still free tests without insurance.  Elective surgeries postponed almost everywhere Germany (so good luck cancer needs surgery right now..) Saxony Bavaria preparing triage incoming patients nearly capacity. Sure completely capacity, situation pretty bad nonetheless. like anyone going able avoid catching this. contagious, matter when. Diabetes expensive without insurance states without medicaid expansion. Walmart cheap insulin sucked. ended vision loss dementia since shit options treatment pocket. Nordstrom fired doctor said take medical leave loss heath insurance still cover supplies. days. absolutely right. think also understand frustration... US intentionally bad sequencing awoid USA variants.

There way USA, country highest consistent infection rates bred new variants. 

They export first blame country lands. Would communist China didn’t hide it. Economy always restrictions, ""living covid"" might mean become permanent.

Like, even one terrorist attack (9/11) basically permanently changed way fly - become way cumbersome, is. stuff might happen businesses now. Ye Delta still primary virus spread many months. Get booster! less likely spread happen get it. “just” lot work here. find money pay every single worker’s salary 2 months? I'm pissed what's going on. SA calling travel restrictions unfair saying pulled immediately. also approve them. African countries calling ""africaphobia"". Random people saying nothing, etc.

LOOK : nobody knows yet dangerous new variant is. know COVID dangerous. Travel restrictions prevent Omicron spreading slow spreading know it. world people understand ? know enemy BETTER attack it. overcautious NEVER killed anybody. happened multiple times every variant, find tonnes Australia/New Zealand hotel transmission stories. people travel continent continent quarantine hell it? Like don’t show pharmacy next day say need test, sit chill. even 2 weeks, I’ll take one week, probably sufficient. unable view rush understand threat posed Omicron variant, worrisome new version coronavirus, experts pointing hopefully early signs may cause mild illness, without trademark symptoms far early assume variant cause severe illness, too, warned Dr. Richard Lessells, coordinates clinical epidemiological data South African Covid Variant Research Many early infections South Africa spotted among younger people likely experience mild illness, said. picture may change virus spreads larger population. Look like lot unnecessary deaths recent academic study (2018) puts death total around 17.4 million, tad previous 18 million estimate. rigorous peer-reviewed study decent confidence interval. I'm comfortable relying number. Here's link: really mean anything yet? Feels way soon knowing means something. There's plenty severe cases variants obviously plenty extremely severe cases. 

With widespread yet, really say means anything yet? Thanks dude! started basically nothing. Maybe got cold ears bike ride next day felt like hangover without drinks night - ringing started. 

ENT already checked hearing issues infections going on. yeah.. try stay calm, relaxation stuff hope finds way tune down. I'm curious medical professionals ground saying encouraging things Fauci fear mongering... blackpilled shit? conservative-leaning self aware wolves moment? So. extra deadly morons then. Darwins march continues. scared would prudent yes. mean I'm I'm confident relying statistical probability scientific theory others.

It's hard. take action think appropriate you. 

There's also ""we do"". We're monolith. Act best interests. I(16m) got first vaccine shot today(Pfizer). told nurse consume animal products day. much trouble far, however talked several people none said said this. really much trouble me, however find very, weird. someone explain? I'm sure anti-vax community cool Israeli's comments coronavirus. quarantine passengers point? understanding close contact got plane getting tested waiting results (small, ill-ventilated room, without masks). didn’t mix HIV- HIV positive patient within patient long time giving ability mutate degree. It’s also errant hypothesis. sequenced single patient Botswana HIV positive. bad really bad Given folks can’t bothered assist fellow citizens slightest way (please wear mask, get vaccinated), that’s helping either. “Almost” definitely? Huh?  OMG WE’RE GOING DIEEEEEE!!!!! look article? reporting survey, conducting one.

Attack source, move goalposts. Anything avoid admitting wrong.

Good luck life attitude. Glad hear well! possible they're reacting to, taking advantage of, media coverage. Omikron got lot attention simply high number mutations represents scary unknown. 

Case numbers already high Europe, many governments already contemplating new restrictions, new restrictions lose popularity public support. big scary thing news gives perfect excuse implement restrictions, better rush things uncertainty hangs air look like proactive. fcked wartime censorship influenza outbreaks Allied armies nations led called ""Spanish Flu"" newspapers could report epidemic neutral Spain England. people got idea came Spain, although unlikely. 

But outbreaks serious Influenza British military camp Etaples early late 1916/early 1917. It’s odd think USA isn’t sequencing. “Number samples sequenced” bottom shows million sequences USA even million UK. USA may slower get going sequencing UK (which admirably fast), USA sequencing.

Now week, two, three sampling reporting USA sequences. That’s also true UK continental Europe. Sequencing takes time. vast majority sets mutations receive new name. naming process kinda arbitrary. would really unhelpful every unique genome name (there's waay many!) know care. I'd take paid it, booked yet, I'd wait least month see numbers shake out. variant big concern. Maybe turns non-issue, media sounded alarm here. epidemiologist, doctors people experts field. also dont know many people poor countries died spanish flu. Many countries didnt even electrical grids newspapers back then. Indigenous south america basically living 1300s good news. F*ck.

Here's two flights South Africa landed Amsterdam late last night. Upon arrival, 600 passengers tested tarmac 61 tests came back positive. 10% prevalence rate flight unbelievably high. Like defies imagination (as Bergstrom said). Especially given passengers negative take off. positive cases need know  * people connected way flight (like tour hotel  * vaccination rate (type, timing,  *  * And, course, caused Omicron? update soon. good news.

/joke Yes. Even minute differences contagiousness amplify exponential system. virus kills less even fraction percent heavily favoured counterparts, transmissibility. variant becoming transmissible seeming orders magnitude. Within systems iterate quickly like viruses, selective pressures manifest acutely evolutionary systems. infected completely different person isolating adjacent room quarantine hotel. means it’s quite possibly crazy contagious.

No. means quarantine hotels bad idea. Hotels designed isolation mind. fact, reverse. There's much air shared. one case, someone quarantine hotel infected another person hall. closest contact one person opened door get food 30 mins later person hall same.

That's places moving away quarantine hotels. build purpose made facilities quarantine. look lot like US style motels. rooms open outside. There's nothing inside. matter, sample size way small matter right now.

Yes see! infection doesnt matter. well established Sars-Cov-2 endemic exposed likely multiple times lifetimes.

What matters severity infection. ultimately become common cold like virus infections milder milder. Everyone needs go Scott Gottlieb's twitter watch latest interview, right now. getting around vaccines.

My mom thinks (she takes covid seriously don’t knock her). Vaccines recognizing. bodies immune response does. B cells data need. need data folks vaccinated respond this. We’re fucked? Again? reason push forward full steam vaccinating world boosted Tuesday wiped two shots reason. took today soreness lymph nodes settle down. think people blame mandates? President? Like not, decision political one current party power already enough remain power even think something like that. party would LOVE cover crap ""taking away freedoms"" get votes.   missing point. ""official"" Spanish flu death number, estimates. comparing apples oranges Israel reported thing.   ""About 65% vaccinated rest half-vaccinated"" amount panic joke. good news. F*ck.   living rock? Even delta could get covid double vaxxed. mean vaxx significantly reduce chances getting though, get it, reduce chance hospitalization/death. likely still true variant, although protection might less.

We'll know lot 2 weeks. know Omicron strain? got boosted days ago though wait another 6 months Onicron one? Hey Google play scene billy Madison principal roasts Billy. wishy washy news article headlines?

“Omicron potentially almost definitely maybe already US… almost”  Surveys run interpreted scientists. reporters.  ever ended happening Lambda variant dominant Peru? get outcompeted Delta? Based read, might different enough protein vaccines recongize it. reason vaccine companies already started new vaccines 6 weeks develop 60-90 days distribute like March 1st available earliest feel like people pay attention this, make even bigger fuss tho...

I wish words logic way always 🤷 way USA, country highest consistent infection rates bred new variants.

Plenty shown --- none infectious Alpha Delta strains overtook them. Yes, trust USA Today editorial team experts quote article. It’s fear next last. Easy feel looking USA Hey Google play Bob Marley - Three Little Birds Wer hareetz zitiert hat verloren I’m - wtf? pretty rough reaction booster well, first two doses. got mine Friday night woke yesterday everything hurt spent day sleeping. I'm much better today, I'll take day like yesterday permanent heart lung damage covid day.  You’re loser booster first two shots. South Africa quite young country, demographically speaking? That's inevitably going tilt results towards mild symptoms good survival rates compared nations old people. know travel bans work (this variant already everywhere) importantly want countries behave like China beginning hide facts several weeks. 

But yes inevitable everyone would go travel bans anyway. Also many supposed anti vaxxers either fairweather really lazy fucks? Alright good don’t shutdowns don’t work countries Aww muffin. know data doesn’t exist yet. 

It will, give time. Authorities taking large steps know bad. isn’t drill. stop naive realize gravity situation. There’s hidden agenda, there’s invisible hand, suck realize really bad. interesting thing learned yesterday first case tested negative entry (I believe) Hong Kong. Tested positive days later new variant, infected completely different person isolating adjacent room quarantine hotel. means it’s quite possibly crazy contagious. Short sequence data, mRNA used vaccine, traditionally represented text file format perfectly suitable git repo. Sure, problem! I'm really sure point really trying make. I'm assuming NPIs. way rate spread NPIs completely abandoned. going happen. binary option. Elimination ""fuck it, nothing anyway"". lot value NPIs, slowing spread, etc. Time quite valuable, especially science side. Oh, Dr. Sickle. tired bullshit. That's cool all, waiting data?

You extremely high degree protection. live life. smart, don’t overly paranoid. Even caught Covid, vaccine status basically guarantees would mild case. Next Megatron! “The government plans unveil set quarantine measures Monday tackle spike COVID-19 cases. Health authorities considering setting period validity vaccinations passports six months bid encourage people receive booster shots later.”

This seems bad set vaccination passes expire day many people (everyone 50) would first eligible get booster shot. seems like weeks leeway least.    could, think general population pretty fed sacrificing lifestyle prevention. Especially ""canceling flights"". That's drastic. think vax passports indoor masks pretty common even today countries. Pandemics typically end virus evolves less severe, contagious form doesn’t kill hosts. I’ve read people stating might possible covid able kill many hosts remain highly transmissible… maybe Omicron variant continue outcompete rest give humanity reprieve.  “You guys.”

Yeah. Us guys have, start, stated COVID real vaccines beneficial. Us monsters. nice socially interact people sometimes. wouldn’t know it’s Covid Taco Bell still can't tell Natalie Portman Kiera Knightly apart. movements governments 2 years past start covid electoral changed Delta variant disaster. That's all. There's nothing behind preparing. FAR...things point less serious Delta...but easier infect....in terms pandemic, that's extremely cautious good news.

Good luck thanks getting booster! US CDC requires one day old antigen test unvaccinated three day old test unvaccinated. antigen tests.  20% positives according health Secretary   COVID discussed daytime soap operas now? find little funny, wear masks get freaked whenever get exposed someone tested positive? Russia building troops Ukraine border sponsoring/sending refugees thru Belarus enter EU via Poland. Russia EU mercy natural gas &amp; American influence dwindling. testing see take Ukraine. 

As person vested biotechnology read many companies covid, vaccine development counter multiple variants rate Covid going at. vaccines got already made influenza tweaked fight covid. Pfizer moderna said take 100 days tweak new vaccines omicron, that’s 3 months maybe. 

The global economy cannot recover another complete lockdown 3 months another 6 month vaccine roll out. entering uncharted territories. 

Our hope omicron less deadly original covid virus gives us mild symptoms. highly doubt they’ve publicly stated growth potential aka it’s getting stronger. always think would happen results opposite (like study matched Israeli study). would inconvenient. They’d downplay policy reasons.  every.new variant name progressively get ominous sounding?   Nah, human brains. Gotta remember, built disregard ideas threatening worldview. we're built absorb process ideas reinforce it.

Our ""memory"" vision (ability see past events process them) similar physical vision (our eyes).

Our eyes filter 99% information, present 1% need ""see"" moment.

Our brain thing memory.

There factors, too, though. Trump folks different. praising ignorance rejection knowledge learned, willingness actively lie/deceive oneself order ""win"" argument, etc. stuff unusual, honestly, indicative cult behavior memory issues. Ooh good. BIL anti-vax. may steal line Christmas… shocked Greenland seem care taking proactive measures (such early adoption boosters) countries rather spectacle say ""we something!"" people complain death results lack real action. legit think well, all, ""Spanish Flu"" never really went away, it? learned live it. cares. shit show multiple covid variants going go forever laws passed force us vaccines travel requirements. covid miraculously dissappear. Stay tuned.  Fwiw federal employees year part making moderna vaccine That's great question answer depends degree difference. possible dominate one get inflected both. straightforward answer question; best model see happens. 

BTW, also possible--but unusual--for infectious particularly virulent virus mutate dangerous form. Japanese people okay masks long term coming decades mean rest world get well. ears hurt bruised elastic bands. 

The world *is not* Japan only. 194 countries world.

Sure, get wrong, get used *meantime* pandemic right (Captain Obvious rescue), subsides future, someday, can't get angry people decide wear anymore, much save lives (which proven), simply normal. 

So can't pretend *they future*, coming someone advocates mandatory masking. want keep using them, that's fine, freedom so, professions people LIKELY keep using them, like cooks doctors, expect others abide long run, like actors musicians (especially singers). Pfizer/Moderna better vaccines majority countries able afford them. 

Out curiosity, can’t imagine China better vaccine? longer takes body fight virus, times virus reproduces inside body. times reproduces, mutations happen. 

People compromised immune systems harder time clearing virus system, all. Since keeps reproducing, keeps changing. wonder that's viruses endgames anyway super contagious kill hosts? perhaps viruses like deadly super contagious? It’s stupid fucks compare holocaust survivors one wants around them. there… managed catch covid first second dose. There's lots things could theatre. Cancel flights (including domestic) threshold reached globally (80% vaccine, sub 500K cases, etc). Require vaccine passports indoor public areas (requiring 3rd doses mRNA/2nd doses J&amp;J), require masks indoor areas, cancel large indoor gatherings, etc. Anybody sense knew COVID gonna stick around awhile. still idea summer 2022 get to.

\*they think plot sterilize Muslims. US monopoly idiots. chances uk stopping travel ? read way. quarantine camp

As Australian - wtf australian quaratine camp?  Triple vaxxed *and* prior COVID? probably unbelievably strong immunity. Infected + double vaxxed ppl strongest known immunity, hardly imagine infected + triple vaxxed people much anything worry way personal risk. pretty assured risk, chances you’ll get infect others also probably infinitesimal stage. don’t think even Omicron presents much risk you. Maybe immunity wane eventually you’ll need another booster, I’d say definitely loosen up. advice wait see variant. I'm headspace hard time around strangers trust issues. I've always crossed street avoid people pandemic really enabler antisocial behavior.  really hope get HIV vaccine soon. Probably dying.

But...this make sense. virus evolves way attack people immune systems, by... getting people without functional immune systems? despite fact people functioning immune systems account almost people get infected thus exerting selective pressure virus?

It makes sense. logical. reeks bias. probably actually test changes… countries like US barely compared say UK…. would country steals IP come revolutionary IP own. virus incapacitates host spread full potential, evolutionary pressure virus become less severe.

COVID, however, already pretty well area. spreading serious symptoms set in, indeed often symptoms appear _at all_. really gated way severity illness causes, driver towards less harmful variant. could happen, luck rather evolutionary direction. Please… stop Christmas? person already received two doses mRNA vaccine, second *sting* around nine months ago. contact persons segregated. 

I'm childish reason giggled mistranslation. sure downvoted, basic selective pressure. matter whether virus kills someone terms evolutionary selection propagate happens. That's Ebola never spreads far. COVID transmitted much farther due longer incubation time contagiousness symptom onset, lethality.

I suppose REALLY lethal people might hunkering would act selective pressure, really happening COVID like would something like Ebola.  least honest....  Depressing af think though. Christmas thing anymore? SNL needs make sequel Greek Gods skit arguing COVID naming conventions Don’t tell me. Long hauler since march 2020. Well, that'd apocalyptic, plague... Anecdotal evidence simply: assume, know.

Worthless, I'm still optimistic. weeks we'll know sure.  There's enough discussion long covid symptoms sometimes. dominant variant comes significantly lower rates long covid issues we're seeing people would huge plus exactly I’m going reserve panic real news comes out. clearly wasn’t bad symptoms modify outlook going Greek letters.

So, make sense.  Last summer, lots scientists agreed delta contagious unsure deadly.

An example: would weirdest/best Christmas present ever. booster four weeks. It’ll take minimum 100 days according vaccine manufacturers. Downvotes aside I’m wrong. can’t stop isolation, lockdowns, anything else. delay it… doesn’t matter. one stopped delta. delayed pain.  No, previous months-out-of-date variants reported get clicks.  one actually new urgent, nobody's bothering listen anymore.   said government publications tandem. It’s called primary secondary sourcing.

Incredibly disingenuous discussion. great evening. agree. appeared financial markets started drop slightly news hit press. I'm super suspicious. “Of infected, currently treated home.”

So, um…where rest treated? it’s sore muscles fatigue day two, would anywhere *but* home? I'll probably get downvoted government put unvaccinated people camps pandemic over. 

Don't want get vaccinated? Fine. we're going separate rest population change mind. 

If someone suffer, selfish people, immunocompromised. waste hospital beds doctors them. cots tents treated national guard medics, straining hospital system. 

Make testing compulsory everyone comes contact infected person. Test then, refuse vaccination, send COVID camp. keep accept vaccine safe let out.  surviving ramen getting food poisoning overpriced meal plans? Lucky. I'm totally going cancel groundhog day orgy. think two things. Possible FDA prioritized getting one vaccine fully approved increase uptake rather work multiple time. Also, lots paperwork resources. Pfizer simply much bigger company lots resources experience. Full authorization afaik manufacturing technical hurdles effectiveness safety.  It’s probably lymph node swollen seems fairly common temporary side effect  problem media already trying shout stuff like without actually knowing anything variant. many clickbait headlines promoting fear usually nothing actual article.  kills Biden/Fauci ""well we'll put ban starting... Monday."" personal, places like Boston already shutting anything elective hospitals. weather getting cold, holiday, two large ones coming up...

It's probably already here. Let's slow stop seeding everywhere. line ""well data X,"" like before, can't data far late. still transition period time. think that’s fine.

I able time booster get weeks Thanksgiving. also view didn’t want risk grandma’s health wasnt boostered. would tried quarantine saw otherwise, not, come holiday.

I don’t think it’s bad travel see family take every precaution possible. you’re boostered don’t spend time lots people often you’re probably fine. can’t get boostered double vaccinated wear mask often you’re probably fine. get tested well. think might risk, don’t travel yet. Wait feel it’s safe. Overreacting bad reacting one dumbest things I’ve read. Congratulations Xi variant. Good afternoon, would like week’s special “why going die new strain” old favourite “it ain’t serious bub” Omggggggg you’re boring received first two doses Moderna vaccine. Get 3rd booster Moderna despite EUA? think (may wrong) could get COMIRNATY vaccine booster. 🤦‍♂️ I'll wait facts peer-reviewed studies, thanks.  Agreed. keep getting fumbles public health docs. forgot patients like. mild cases usually loss smell taste one doesn’t present hope symptoms infections maybe different variants. Lol, thanks laugh! Humor keeping sane point. Sort sane.  Goddam, remind pack condoms next time go Oh argument there. wasn’t point. trainwreck money doesn’t reach everyone needs “absolutely nothing.” hate people dress otherwise good arguments bullshit. makes easier others dismiss saying, that’s especially problem they’re saying important. study mice vaccine injected directly vein. 
“Although experts cautious drawing conclusions animal studies, paper unleashed long-simmering debate whether healthcare providers take additional steps ensure needle doesn’t inadvertently enter vein vaccination.

However, even doctors favor additional precautions say inadvertent injection vein extremely unlikely. Providers inject COVID vaccines shoulder, large blood vessels regards?  Sshhh. Don’t let Q hear say this…it automatically means planted there.   curious - immune-evasive there's enough spike protein mutations, much Delta infection Omicron infection preventative other? dominance occur they're different enough?

It's almost impossible there's crossover immunity. think worst case scenario that's actually realistic even could catch both, second one would much milder. intervals 4-5 months though. Best diet ever though. lost lot sense smell early 2020, hasn’t come back way. I’ve lost 20lbs. Food isn’t interesting anymore. 

Would preferred cardio though. Paperwork. Pfizer knocked application quicker. Wait, Jodie Whitaker? Good her.  Apparently they've said it'll take 90 days update vaccine past, onto manufacturing such. even got booster wait updated one, still far behind everyone else. told one kids variant gets country origin, absolutely spread every US state. wouldn’t make delta go away… delta continue course. Except one operates different sets proteins. Aka block delta.

Also delta original. becoming like delta possibility. article healthy people wearing masks isn’t part culture Unlikely. don’t see China opening till 2025-2026. Boosters ensure zero covid.
Only hard borders zero covid. entry China 21 days quarantine + 7 days health checkup post quarantine. 
Until 80-90% world vaccinated + 95% domestic population vaccinated boosted + antivirals firmly market don’t see opening up. 
All likely take another 3-4 years. I’m interested see Chinese population accept rest word forced accept endemicity virus Lies, damn lies statistics   Source? know get one UK without paying arm leg? They’re readily available US last time checked here, offered healthcare workers  anything made omnivalent vaccine ended this.

Its worked on. However requires targeting something common coronavirus really mutate.

Much like broad spectrum antibiotics target part bacteria many bacteria have.

Thing is, probably going happen night. Antibiotics preventative further, bacteria evolve resistance antibiotics.

So develop preventative vaccine mutating coronavirus difficult anyway. find way hit possible coronavirus... tall order. bet decade away reason Netherlands quickly many cases, test lot overhere. 61 suspected cases mentioned tests 2 flights arrived thurday. SA != Africa, median age SA 27. Till americans vaxxed going vax .. even death Ah yes. Something disgraced president said 15 years ago. relevant. real? Holy fuck way.

I feel like may play part much variant spread there. Omicron Delta?  thing must everywhere. It’s going show countries good/bad testing variants. don’t contradictions, they’re saying seems contagious means people could getting means serious cases. However death rate/seriousness might anymore severe strains. Super serial We've got vaccine ofc one fucking cares. Life's short worry covid we're vaccinated already lost two years lives clinical trials, vaccines lower efficacy SA. AstraZeneca low SA stopped using sold stock. everybody enjoying January 2020? escaping existing immunity / vaccines concerning. might mutate something serious, infections higher chance mutates Can't use/get lateral flow devices? It’s greek beta Yeah lot influences affect data. free mandatory testing push diagnosis rates example. still numbers seem support US natural immunity paradise COVID longer risk, compared Europe. And, course, pretended could keep flying around world virus still replicating like crazy. learned nothing denied continued spreading it.  Pro: end delta may sight. 

Con: there’s potentially bigger fish. really centrist feel insurrection isn’t deal breaker? lot things idiots *should* do, that’s they’re idiots, don’t should. Yes life must continue. issue selfishness Americans day one - it’s fake, like normal flu, freedom wear mask on. effort work together. People said screw humanity, going make political. theoretically still reason believe boosters provide least protection Omicron, like totally ineffective Honestly, think reasonable assume infection mortality rate same-ish difference infections diagnosed consistently US. none clear. significantly immunocompromised

I take Stelara.  immunosuppressant.  think decent reason worry. Yes going interesting China deals future. point open allow disease spread. might actually better sooner later long vaccinations still provide good protection severe disease. Maybe round boosters whole country first?  South African vaccine hesitancy primarily driven whites country. Try again.  could said nicer way, I'm pretty sure right. Ja Rule? get Covid news Nicki Minaj. guess people trouble reading comp too…    Nice thing regret one world's lowest vaccine rates. coincidence. things consider: think other, mrna vaccines would available? trustworty estimates? Meanwhile risk setting parents? lot contacts? incidence high? incidence trustworthy country barely test anyone compared countries good testing regime? parents NPI options like good quality masks, good airflow, access soap frequent hand washing, distance people? work many people, mostly indoors?

Whats health status parents, risk factors? contact people risk factors?

What countries health committee recommend?

All things hve considered. believe mrna vaccines wont accessible months i'd recommend AZ booster.

A 3rd dose AZ provoke stronger immune reaction, therefore seems good take booster, dont access mrna Tolerability Immunogenicity Late Second Dose Third Dose ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) Mr. Pfizer busy man, personally making vaccines, Omicron testing eating dinner evenings. Give poor man break. hear he's going rough patch wife, too. immune system all, case would quickly die multitude otherwise insignificant infections. people weakened immune system (e.g. AIDS, advanced cancer), unable clear infection fully, potentially many months. gives virus plenty time evolve concert patients immune system, thus explaining high level mutations without evidence antecedent strains  comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Yay, another variant=another round profits companies graves could’ve saved earlier rounds relinquishing ghoulish practice vaccine patents pandemic! think he's saying 99.5% still bad. 0.05% world's population still insane amount.   Narrator: ""It didn't"" news, Fleet Admiral Princeton graduate Foux in'Obvious reminds Navy water wet. sell 5 billion vaccines could give permanent immunity. I'm guessing that's decent motivation. I’m liking new mild variant. Well deep pockets Wall Street react well it, they'd one first know. think = assume limited understanding works Door door vaccines lmao. Let sign come give one porch don’t give shit. I’ll even pay gas. Every news outlet says something people interested news. Many repeating atory. resort conspiracy regular facts explain everything easily? Personally feel like variant U.K. drive behind Europe’s boom voodoo, moron. Except course mRNA vaccin technology developed universities pharmaceutical companies take profit. least questionable business model. get booster return normal

I always see people making comments like (especially anti-vaxxers), actually see public health authorities making unqualified claim. talking cases deaths. replied op said ""natural immunity"" may higher US. natural immunity would think case numbers.
 
If US deaths Europe Europe cases, would seem indicate anything even dangerous US. (Though think might simplistic). 0 unless deadly. Well good thing new Vienna city country sounded similar Australia. Also Fauci: Yes, tried torturing dogs, though? said border closures like warranted.    Anyone know testing on? read 60 positives plane Amsterdam smattering others spread around world. understand lab tests, says article molecular make new variant Friday, can't started yet. 114 deaths day backlog tho, since numbers general low, plays big part ""spike"". Without backlog day seems like deaths really shown movement yet, expected since case spike still pretty recent. asked “ANY reason suspect happened among people HIV”. cannot help like reason, doesn’t change fact months long chronic infections immunocompromised shown large amounts mutations past. 

If nothing else, hopefully line thinking motivates countries adopt measures protect cannot effectively fight virus. ever given injection? Shit - ever given someone else injection? simple sounds That’s happens messaging “get booster return normal” like US. Stadiums packed, airports packed, going back now. can’t blame people honestly. It’s 2 years missed lot celebrations things make life enjoyable would basically pay people lock stop another variant.  Possibly there’s zero evidence new variant less lethal news outlet claiming they’re seeing serious cases, including ICU admissions, among people 20s 30s.

If look, patients ICU cited unvaccinated (65%) single shot vaccinated (35%).

Not heard anything yet fully vaccinated individual becoming seriously ill. Still early seems encouraging. UK’s flexible mask policy bizarre. 

I would less surprised Tory government given free hazmat suits get public flashing cash stores restaurants again, nope went mask free policy. certain point life must go on. Yeah. Fingers crossed, variant extremely transmissible also worse common cold, might bring end pandemic. know sure mid-December, increase transmissibility without fatality rate decrease could bad March 2020 again. ? NSW Victoria came lockdown weeks ago. wanted read article, I’d click link!! THIS^ disappointed. thing starting get better. go back way like last year. possibilities lockdown again?  Yeah say this, many double vaxxed testing positive Delta nothing really new here.. need guard dogs sniff COVID. weekly seem frequently enough shit  Like.he fucking knows. enough confirmed cases know sure. pure speculation Awesome! terrible colds RSV infections. sad part hear “They told us MILD! lied!!!” Pfizer saying along. That’s one benefits MRNA platform. Moderna vaccine created January 2020.   way it. Trying keep countries it’s detected pointless. Many people infected COVID US Europe, maybe there’s natural immunity US. population may respond exact way population Europe.   lol They've coddled long. purge necessary.  can’t like flu it’s easily spread, deadly, though. hope get point don’t think soon. develop altered vaccine account new mutations within less week.

Huh, *supposedly*.

Except far refuse continue peddle steps behind, outdated vaccine delta existed. Personally, I'm tired constantly steps behind virus. first person parroting information, new vaccines? used? Even used produce better vaccines per variant, gotta get stalled fda emergency authorization, rolled almost caste system. time red tape done there's another variant. I'm sick all. really know immune system works. Like find Omicron say I've seen something similar antibodies working let's make adjustements try random stuff antibodies fail? Dr. Drake Ramoray? No. never. both! Natural immunity last 8 months  Y’all need bum gun. sample expedited bumped done asap could quick couple days. I'm hoping we'll Los Angeles samples done Monday since said getting priority. Multiple people know bad reactions Moderna, stick Pfizer next one. Ahhahahahahaaa!😂😂😂 Fucking Might happen. COVID mutates relatively slowly compared stuff like flu. appears least 3x slower. Perhaps many more. proofreading mechanism reduces mutation rate. 

There's extraordinary number cases yet virus still 9.99% identical original. 

There nature study back showed convalescent sera could even neutralize original SARS, quite genetically distant COVID. current rate would take something like 100 years COVID mutate much. 

Our vaccines based original strain still effective despite billion infections. 

My guess vaccines annual bunch immunity built up. virus mutate slower become childhood vaccination. rushing book vaccine dose, panicking really useful regardless Omicron does.

But panicking leads go get first/second/third dose, highly productive. friend without first dose, take month dose start providing protection - need get now. point won’t take advice even comes FOX GOP  long sequencing confirmation take ?  correction. still highly effective preventing hospitalization, much less effective preventing symptomatic infection. valuable scrambling get many people possible shots demand far outstripped supply. There's much reason get anymore, valuable.  Thank you. needed clarification. anecdotal point. can’t make conclusions based 2 doctors saying they’ve seen. It’s fully realized data.   61 “probable” cases NL one flight ZA expected, zero fully vaccinated people showing much symptoms... vaccines work Oh wow hot take! Get front page asap!!   Rly ? Lol joke. source discussed said ""extremely unlikely"". comment something ""extremely unlikely"" happen lot action million times. That's unreasonable.

Not everything agree alt-right conspiracy. It’s less two weeks. likely initiation late September late October, 95% CI.  Something 100% effective != Something effective


Ever heard Swiss Cheese defense? working Healthcare. know chance 1 case first tested? 8? Hong Kong Nov 11, South Africa Nov 9, sequenced reported days ago. must everywhere long lags. “We won’t know weeks” it’s spreading like wildfire. 

Like saying. won’t know good flame retardant fire burn. 

No thanks. I’d like clear now.  I’ve three well enough third one I’ve got rejected ignorants, point fighting covid pals doesn’t want take proven vaccine. wrong shouldn’t listen whatever crazy source spreading misinformation. sociopaths. never able convince them.

Sadly, totally convinced right possibly get others sick hate cloth.  mean, like vaccine? problem isn’t everyone else’s. Take precautions accept fact world doesn’t revolve around you.  know little virus publicly yet action highest levels government alarming. One source described variant ""almost perfect"" simply series isolated, natural mutations ""seemingly designed"" evade current protections. L.A. County sequences said today 100% cases still Delta. That's us though. Yeah, new variants keep popping tearing South Africa testing. nothing non-existent vaccine rate.  

That must it. data available seems slim. I'm really surprised *entire world* reacting quickly.

Maybe pandemic little bit boring state ""vaccinate, vaccinate, vaccinate"" world excited take new challenge. failed community booster scheduled mid-December. still worthwhile get it? fools errand given likely won’t even protect Omicron? could make ineligible Omicron-specific shot months? Stopping flights African countries half measure, little late. Maybe people care it’s Africa…because reasons. might severe cases head straight hospitals GPs see milder ones. would expect hospitals get bulk severe cases traffic accidents vs GPs. spike protein mutated, varients dropped vaccine efficacy without much mutation spike itself, vaccines entirely replicating  Except it’s reasonable. It’s complete bullshit alt-right uses. suggest get bent fear mongering continues, 2 years later. Hey protocols work covid... Vaccines miracle cure. Nobody democratic community buying narrative anymore. Tjeyve done two, boosters, magical new variant.. pharmecudical industrial complex. playing game anymore. Easy killer. may better job detecting countries. likely major cities connection SA last weeks. don’t event know originated there. proportionate amount positive tests sequenced. mild seems expected. Still somewhat effective.

-	Higher virulence leading young adults hospitalized.
-	1/3 *at least* one shot.
-	“Most” half-vaccinated. That’s wide range possibilities. talking 1/6 fully vaccinated low number?

Was really hoping would less virulent could possible end pandemic. estimates accurate see studies, looks likely kick ass. Feel bad healthcare workers.

I think younger people likely vaccinate faced deadly variant.

Hopefully fucking pills also come soon make difference. Two doses jnj par moderna pfizer, data lagging behind. 

Booster shot two months provided 94 percent protection COVID-19 U.S.
The Phase 3 ENSEMBLE 2 study showed another shot Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine given 56 days first provided:

100 percent protection (CI, 33%-100%) severe/critical COVID-19 – least 14 days post-final vaccination.
75 percent protection symptomatic (moderate severe/critical) COVID-19 globally (CI, 55%-87%).
94 percent protection symptomatic (moderate severe/critical) COVID-19 U.S. (CI, dont wait er call provider urgent care, 15 mins phone network doctor bet right rain Dear experts, admire eternal optimism face stark cold reality. Lol, I'm making suggestion. made reasonable response flew handle.

If sort thing makes angry quickly, probably consider commenting all, taking minutes calm hit submit. Boooooooccckkkk clearly referring surge here, thus narcissistic people country fueled entire 4th surge delta. unless predicted mutations new variants may have, planned advance  I'm sure set data right, one stat read said ENTIRETY remaining 35% one dose, most.

Even most, still means non-fully-vaccinated disproportionately represent hospitalisations. good sign.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  tell me? GFY anyone good statistics population changes during/due COVID? 

I'm really curious changes birth rates, excess mortality, stuff like that. Oh dear god. 😖 LACDPH already put [statement](http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/phcommon/public/media/mediapubhpdetail.cfm?prid=3528) today they'd sequencing it, we'll know soon. World War Z!!! current Pfizer vaccine effective Omicron, correspondingly mean Omicron-specific vaccine effective original/delta COVID?

Unless expertise vaccines, sounds like exactly kind unsourced speculation avoiding.  imagine person 2019 shown news headline “Omicron US!” I’d pretty convinced we’d discovered alien robots something. hope ignore ridiculous drivel.  really don’t. live bubble somewhat reasonable people. really don’t associate guys believe made shit stick sense respond it. Remember took tour mask factory required masks worn, surrounded workers wearing masks, on… goggles? 

That shit wild.  State issue. Didnt florida recently declare lowest infection rate per capita, despite even reporting testing shit? worth aware milder infectious variant actually cause deaths healthcare problems. 

""Milder"" usually means individual CFR hospitalisation rate reduced - linear reduction - whereas increasing infectious exponential increase cases thus deaths hospitalisations.

If couple reported possible greater risk vaccine escape and/or reinfection - things look good. 

It's possible variant might infectious enough burn (and variants) even got huge amounts vaccine escape significantly increased reinfection risk there's still plenty susceptible individuals make getting herd immunity level uncomfortable indeed.

It may yet turn false alarm though. genuinely cannot imagine stress pandemic brought all. hope variant become people fearing. can’t imagine number vaccine made stories countries, people still believe photoshopped pictures Facebook here. best convince friends vaccinate explaining works wish gouvernement would large scale bring vaccine ask people it.  Hiv good genome surveillance Alot assumptions btw, since could read post's title actual article, man case probably got infected Africa since returned home 10 days time spread one knew asymptotic. caught airport trying go back Africa work, yeah... safe say circulating time. I'm hoping China ""We 5k deaths COVID"" thing. History books ain't going thing near future, societal collapse predicted next decades least within current century. I'm okay it.

I'm 33 years old though think considered high risk hear Canada throwing away many vaccines. Better offer boosters want rather tossing.

Better yet, provide countries need vaccine reduce risk variants emerging. sell much 5 billion vaccines pandemic keeps going constant need boosters. decent motivation make ""too good"" vaccine. complying. Remember liars said vaccine would way out? anyone know whether ""normal"" corona antibodies also protect omicron variant? so, many? anyone know whether ""normal"" corona antibodies also protect omicron variant? so, many? There’s literally variant test needed. Hence “We’re testing Beta thought Delta wild type” well thought out: 10000% need sequence Omicron good idea it’s around. run one common PCR tests planet (Thermo Fisher Scientific TaqPath major one here). N ORF1-AB pop positive shows negative, almost certainly Omicron send testing. you’re depending lateral flow (antigen) tests, don’t provide variant specific testing. vaccines shit. looks like incubation period quite long. Like 11 days long. probably sick people everywhere, youve said. won’t know week more. Americans, got handful people like UK too, America loud  major extrapolation. still little data this. blindly claiming Ivermectin zero application 66 peer reviewed medical studies done demonstrate Ivermectin’s ability inhibit replication broad-spectrum viruses. protease inhibits breakdown COVID spike protein %81 thus allowing enter cell replicate further. 

The people complain misinformation seem ones spreading it. skipped Nu Xi Greek alphabet are. case it’s pandemic anymore. virus circulating world. 

In certain countries close becoming endemic, peakes waves still high handled health care systems.  wonder Omicron arrives India.

Which ... erm .. day now. Pretty sure 98% people completely stopped giving shit COVID. another cold flu now... pandemic never over.

The pandemic turn endemic, that's call """"over"". read yesterday deadly vulnerable groups. Maybe also vaccine-resistant point time Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Actual worst case scenario end VAERS. everything need know:

We know weeks know probably half-kidding let remind Biontech/Pfizer Moderna vaccines need cooled - 80° Celsius (-120° Fahrenheit). improve social score mean, avoid life working 24/7 sweatshop, yes. We're fine mate  Yeah idiotic. Like it’s spreading sneezing sitting near someone, wouldn’t want wear mask? mean that’s kinda vaccines are. Patches immune system… Wish download speed better tho mean theory believe practical evidence. that's kind thing concerns maybe play safe weeks data collected. reckon CCP glad lock everything known lethality Omicron. aren’t dummies, much reaching control people democratic nations. “Let countries Petri dish, it’s transmissible less invasive/virulent…”, lax rules people. 

Not making comment valuation governmental control, saying governmental control wait information.

..that’s assuming it’s already globally spread, likely is. Historically speaking, viruses mutate higher transmissibility lower lethality - beneficial virus mutate such. reckon we’ll eventually “flu” “Covid” annual shots. Hopefully becomes less lethal.. it’s endemic now. isn’t going go away. Ever. think it’s safe assume it’s already here. country Africa testing Variants, likely nation report first. 5+ million deaths = mundane  Can't name variants first person detected in? Like half city locked due Larry variant? I'm conundrum. could get booster maybe would need tweaked one. gonna wait weeks get booster get one hope covers new variant ... think getting booster would let get another booster variant ... Kinda trying make educated decision missing key elements best decision would ... Depends. one done disposable ones pretty easy. take Humira week self administer. Granted it’s thigh arm, problem it. parts virus aren’t really relevant stopping infection. Maybe envelope antibody two, comes preventing infection: Spike far pressing concern. immune system can’t really react proteins internal virus they’ve already entered cells minimum started replicating. Oh god! Open borders dropping like flies. Except, seen storage conditions vaccines? they're truck three hours lying table home hours more, they're going effect How'd go Delta N C R N

We didn't. went C R N. people countries haven’t started giving booster shots yet Maybe are? stat says roughly 65% unvaccinated 'most rest' one dose. Even non-generous definition most, still mean unvaccinated one-dosed disproportionately represented statistics. BoostBox There's evidence history viral theory make strong possibility. Vaccines general don’t work great HIV intramuscular injections incredibly simple  yes mistake 500% Yep. Hopefully go straight shred lungs without symptoms smell/taste department.  people think EXPERTS Facebook pages Patreon propaganda channels. That's unvaccinated go medical advice ... contract COVID-19 ... displace cancer patients need surgery, diabetics, transplant recipients, coronary bypass operation candidates rest people vaccinated part. Right. Germany went crisis eyes wide open. October ( barely two months ago) calling freedom days dropping restrictions. numbers went became exponential numbers exploding right now. Germany running shades red COVID incidence maps.

The German army relocate deathly sick COVID patients plane anywhere still find hospital bed. Many Operations postponed. means example tumor patients can't get tumor removed

So would suggest looking whats happening Europe right continue take situation seriously. mean even got 4th dose Like happened Merkel, Johnson, Biden Macron Greek letters. downvoted completely legitimate opinion, choice even 5% chance death suffer 10 years farcical control porn, I'd take chances. Life short scared ultimately mundane grand scheme things. IMHO, ""living it"" mean ever returning normal. totally managed though vaccinations effective treatments even virus totally eradicated. moving endemic phase effecitvely *is* end pandemic. type variant: Alpha (Which nearly eliminated Delta) Omicron two major variants cause gene dropout. That's right; PCR, full sequencing. Omg! game first advertised. However, bought game came out, extremely disappointed. Steam even giving people refunds bad game first. can't find game play see finally enjoy game. shame started making game decent got huge negative reviews bombed. It’s fast, quacks like duck, walks like duck, it’s safe assume it’s duck sequencing finishes. Omnicron sounds fucking crazy sounds like alien kind killer robot. How'd go Delta N C R N Modena vaccine two months pandemic declared?!  could find viral sized cane definitely would caught pants proclaimed non-pandemic Feb 2020, world could fighting chance.

China good stocks ppe slam big red panic button DONE FIRST TIME. prior acquired immunity limited effect Omicron, Omicron likely limited use conferring immunity strains. flight restriction go effect Monday anyway. weekend, flights coming full new strain, even though already probably.

If ever much deadly pandemic airborne, world big trouble. react fast enough, far much open travel everywhere constantly. It'll happen one day. COVID bad could lot worse too.  Probably. become endemic, constantly changing evolving like flu viruses. aware America different continent sperated oceans? travel ban Africa (and ideally Europe know) exactly think they'd get America hell high water? Hitch ride container vessel that's stuck port month? Reposting question yesterday's mean, cases vairous places like Belgium, Germany, Hong Kong already. Even though found airport, considering human detection slower actual spread, convinced already went worldwide. thing that, Omicron easily distinguishable Delta assume outcompetess dominant variants, even reported cases now. missing something here? Maybe try caning virus. Lord knows deserves it. Sounds like early 2020 don’t it? Definitely thinking today. Masks never going away  presenting backed data anyone made available evaluation virologists data widly released.

&amp;#x200B;

What happening though SA representatives thrilled cutoff world.

&amp;#x200B;

You provide context stuff like this. irresponsible present substantiated claim. Nu Puny human, comes great planet Omicron Persei 8. vaccine efficacy reduced negligible mean leisure travel. makes bulk unnecessary travel. Though catch 22 airlines go bust trying fly handful people categories mentioned. keep planes air. Omicron waiting wings. Oh poor sweet naive experts… vaccinated person followed lockdown last 2 years, get fucked. I'm anymore. always new fucking variant. happens run Greek letters?

Everybody wants vaccinated vaccinated. *People fucking die*. That's life. We've done everything can, time move fuck on.  Set like epi-pen, shove pen someone's leg (or arm case) pen work. could manage much! Right, problem ""spreading"" part... went North Sea coast august people wearing masks German tourists like us. flabbergasted. hospitals full, like heading example Belgium Germany, choice lockdown. variant need much contagious Delta happen, could well happen Delta already. friend booster honesty monitor symptoms. protected anyone else. It’s pointless knowing delta omicron. treatments same. It’s new virus Chilly today. I'd take 150k we've living China well. Like I've telling people. kill now, might kill later life. Based what?   It’s 5 days. don’t know. furloughed work Feb 2020 people worked echo chamber 'it's flu"". Oh great :-( Thanks warning.  Stick amc lol... boyfriend noticeably didn’t get vaccine requirements either. He’s pretending that’s objection now. clearly one before, changed again. give info he’ll still deny it. boyfriend antivax. need decide that’s something want enable not. taking precautions feel entitled go maskless everywhere, visit vaccinated people speak vaccine? nurse either vegetarian listen “holistic” advice k  operate coming weeks? boosted wear mask public settings. attend person classes pretty conservative school people don’t wear masks. scientists saying boosted individuals? skipping class next two weeks know worry much. mean, that's true. Back February 2020 know sars-cov-2 fatality rate 10% 2%, knowing cases mild something good. one said articles like flu. Damn people thread really selective/biased memory lol. I'm going pretend COVID treated seriously start. Sorry.

Let's treat variant caution then. nice repeat. Sounds good. I. claim arguably worst offense. I’m glad claim mostly retracted though. 

An funny thing is, even claim true, would pretty much impossible control spread variant, matter many restrictions used harsh lockdowns would be. every virus follows ""rule."" far, Europe seeing “imported cases”. local spread within population – linked international travel – see much transmissibility typical European population.

This key takeaway here. yet know variant respond majority vaccinated population. need get tested 3 days flight long flights, especially South Africa Australia, van easily take 2 days. travelled UK NZ time got PCR tested arrival NZ 6 days since travel PCR. Ample time get infected. know know real story variant weeks still. relax. face it, emergence Omicron variant unhappy fulfillment expert predictions failure prioritize vaccinations African countries would allow coronavirus continue circulate mutate there, imperiling world’s ability move beyond Western nations kept global vaccine supply themselves, African countries denied access doses could afford them. Around 10 percent people Africa received one dose vaccine, compared 64 percent North America 62 percent problem changing shape. recent weeks, vaccines started flow Africa, new challenge rapidly scale vaccinations — South Africa haven’t completely overcome problem vaccine supply lower-income countries,” said Shabir Madhi, virologist University Witwatersrand Johannesburg. “But available, countries struggling scale up.” smart use fake covid certificates, there? thinking? Masks proven extremely effective reducing spread still mandated public spaces. You’re gonna get bunch “hurrrdurrr freedom refuse live fear” responses, enjoy Yeah, data really strange. group 18-34 years old, 21,39% fully vaccinated additional 5,52% partially vaccinated. assume ""most"" least half, means:

* 73,09% population 65% severe cases (unvaccinated)
* 5.52% population 17.5% severe cases (partially vaccinated)
* 21.39% population 17.5% severe cases less (fully vaccinated)

This would mean full vaccination slight benefit (or more), partial vaccination would lead significant ADE Yes proven do. preliminary evidence showing variant could “immune vaccines.” fact, anything, early evidence Israel seems show current vaccines still effective it. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

When, who, where?


[This article](www.newscientist.com/article/2261805-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine/) 2020 contains quote expert saying annual boosters may necessary. called crazy claiming that? Germany always kept masks malls/public transport… want know known unknowns unknown knowns.  Like flu vaccine? varicella? Mumps? Rubella? Tetanus? Pertussis? Small pox?

These vaccines provide full immunity either. time-frames varied data they've around decades. know shit covid vaccine stacks long-term like those.  Omicron breaks notepad schemes exactly opposite Omicron ends problematic, yet less mitigated boosters

That scenario strikes improbable. order true would huge gap antibodies t-cell response produced man-made vaccines versus produced natural immunity variant. conceivable plausible. seen variant. virus parasite

Do really work healthcare? that's vital bit info  Well wasted time hankering  weren’t vaccinated now?  Also it’s completely gone. Get booster now. doesn’t change anything said. 100 days optimistic answer puts us 2nd week March. What, any, changes considering personal lifestyle choices prepare another wave infections. example, relaxed mitigation strategies numbers dipped, changing habits limiting exposure? Turn away everyone willingly unvaccinated thread right? Chicago, indoor dining banned November February last year. 3 days already got confident declarations everything's cool idea work, time we're faced data set includes least 13 (and likely more) omicron-positive airline passengers trigger positive result rapid antigen test within 24 hours boarding flight. lots human failures could account this, including crappily designed poorly administered tests (or test results simply falsified way ease various people's travel arrangements), test insensitivity early-stage omicron least need investigated. side kept saying flu

Yeah, worse flu. people happy taking yearly boosters flu, happy take least covid.


Also person suggested people crazy suggesting covid boosters may necessary. Scientists experts discussed potential need boosters beginning. creating scenario get upset at. No?

There videos people fully dropping streets hellish stuff coming China fairly early on. many unvaccinated live hydrochloraquin ivermectin prophylactics got sick variant? many unvaccinated ventilators severe symptoms? far questions are. answered. awwn 3 trolls today. 3 saying lockdown looked post history. Full trolling. second dose hit extremely hard. Bed ridden day worst aches I’ve ever felt. Fever. Chills. Brain fog. useless effects lingered 3-4 days. 

And whole time like “if even half bad COVID would I’m glad I’m going now”.

That said, suits CPC well now. It’s interesting see governments responded prioritize— western governments prioritized freedom probably fault. China prioritized safety fault. Japan Korea Taiwan middle.

I know people downvote people asking concerned questions.

I answers either try make best informed decisions weighing potential risks. angry virus, leaves alone, think logic is.  Honestly reason placate anti-vaxxers. know vaccinated spread it, making sure unvaccinated go negative makes difference whether stay negative end hospital. Well prolly means variant New England yet, least flew us. everyone sees doctor 🙃🙂🙃🙂 Washington State too. 6+ months post vaccinated absolutely reason wait. boosters provide additional protection COVID right likely provide protection new variants well. point trying roll dice waiting modified vaccine take months get market. feel like I'm playing Plague Inc watching red lines fly new countries realtime headlines Same. privileged flippantly say ""oh yes months lock fine"".  I've wearing damn mask nearly 2 years. Don’t disagree statements. least US always going political matter what. family masks second pandemic announced one public areas. We’d watching happening China knew matter time. even absolute transparency existed beginning, chunk people US would written off. Regardless, original point article blames variants emerging wealthy countries “hoarded vaccine”. Sheer numbers geographical distance, combined communities antivax sentiments baked huge immunocompromised population mean outcome always going happen regardless adequate supply vaccines. doubt that. PCR tests usually designed highly conserved targets. unlikely current tests would fail pick omicron. impossible, I'll grant you, considering DNA targets selected, much doubt it. hasq confirmed widely used PCR tests capable detecting omicron. 

Secondly, pick variant airport plane, incubation period would sufficient allow airport test pick infection yet. PCR tests start pick covid 1-3 days symptoms start showing, median incubation period around 5 days, airport test going detect anything picked flight. absolute earliest anything could detected 2 days exposure, like 3-5 days. Granted, long layovers South Africa flying via middle east, long. Madness talking lockdown. get damn booster wear mask need to. Interesting travellers came Nigeria, country outside South Africa enjoying lowest case counts since beginning pandemic. journalism? Yes, get vaccine available means, shut society point comes. risk 1 year old higher flu CoVID-19... believe me? Check statistics.

Good news: omicron confirmed New Zealand yet, [only news: quarantine hotels work, [they may make things omicron patient quarantine hotel Hong Kong infected guest completely different room, likely ventilation system. public health officials emphasize permanent masking social distancing skepticism irrationality amongst already irrational multiply.

This. becoming asinine point.

Hopefully. heard Thursday. Yeah, even close square one. Remember impossible even get test? fact tests already detect Omicron puts us miles ahead start 2020. mention vaccines (which hopefully still effective), masks, knowledge transmission treatment. Back 2020 people still convinced COVID spread aerosols. even Omicron worst case scenario case vaccine effectiveness (which doubt), new mRNA vaccines able produced short time frame. Fair, time, strain transmissible fear, finding 2 community cases means travel ban accomplish little. 

Trying nail community cases country without full scale contact tracing, quarantine, one lockdown incredibly difficult. Nope. We’re sick crap evidence yet it’s outcompeting Delta. virtually Delta around compete province first set alarm. talking butt. Everyone overreacting. wait data. would apply high degree asymptomatic spread. Since case Corona, really selective pressure regards less deadliness.

Say bye hotels airplanes. totally agree you. acknowledge it’s concern needs reported. scientists seem saying don’t enough data yet determine it’s going huge problem not. Whereas mainstream media ( Australia) overreacting posting clickbait articles it’s going spread Australia. Sick it. 
Not saying bury head sand media outlets providing balanced view. example several scientists provided positives:
1. identified v early
2. Vaccines could altered new variants go full production within 6 weeks
3. Easier detect variant pcr tests

Btw I’m fully vaccinated anti masker etc anyone makes assumptions Although still effective Delta, take hit symptomatic infection specifically.. summer expert predicted already idea mutation could evade vaccine efficacy. agree him, updated it. seem suggest spike protein.

I find bit shocking formula changed since original version virus. Delta good example like saying. variant able breakthrough vaccine easily mutation. extraordinary prevalence without huge hospitalization/mortality spike South Africa, omicron may less virulent previous variants.   Honest question: anyone care anymore?

The attention given disproportionate risk.

Can people see that? Joe Rogan needs visit Karma. get information may ask? Article news? guess: statistically, counting billions billions people world, actually \*have\* progressed species terms witch burnings. \*have not\* progressed, see world fear emotion, well, really drag average rest us. still interesting know truly infectious virulent is. don’t see act like know everything variant already truly know almost nothing point. Israel advanced medical system arguably effective intelligence agency world.

You’re assuming didn’t know public.

Although it’s likely they’re simply operating abundance caution, it’s possible know something don’t. Yes sounds right. 2.3/100,000 equivalent 23/1 million. Rates vary regions much. data Canada:

“The rate myocarditis pericarditis Ontario, Canada 10.5 per 1 million doses Pfizer vaccine (0.0011%) 24.7 per 1 million doses Moderna vaccine 8 mutations spike protein Yeah experts pandemics experts human thinking.

Sorry confusuon. wondering earlier, data COVID vaccine effectiveness HIV patients? countries Africa 20%+ adult population HIV. go again. can’t stop global commerce lol Dis de wæe

I mention food getting strange. half-expect wake inside simulator fed fly cakes. Eh, let know variant Omicron Persei 8 gets here. Lrrr. This. Feels like world climbing staircase end, trying reach goal never completed. 

People becoming slaves COVID, it’s good thing. get vaccinated, wear mask high risk environment. perpetual life cycle restrictions imposed lifted isn’t feasible. Timing key. Also, noted individuals skewed younger. Way positive.  PCR tell type variant, you’re right would need sequenced know it’s Omicron specifically. German health minister actually said 6 months vaccinated, recovered died off. saying worse illness vaccinated person get, bad cold. told wrong. What's wrong that? like proven wrong? 10,000 number thought disproven data artifact? basically idea bad ebola, say sure... right. True, might new variant emerged South Africa, thing exploded cases single day. Like Nov 22 around 300 new cases, day later number rose 10000 new cases. also blame fact South Africa managed fully vaccinate 25% population, gives room virus keep mutating. thing consider many vaccines available. surplus doses, *their* fault slow rollout, shortage, *everybody's* fault delivering vaccines SA Africa general ASAP. second scenario, continue hoard vaccines poor nations keep struggling, likely scenario, going keep struggling virus many many months come.

GET VACCINATED ASAP. got first two, get booster ingredients!? question! wondering may speed things 2-5s Omicron making news, speed 5-11s Delta wreaking havoc hopes real low. deaths mostly 50 years old; would passed genes. I'm sure gauge surprise internet forum, clearly addressed second comment thread. Good luck desperate pedantry, though. I'll 'surprised' latest booster shot magically fix this. know much Football. happen live road Twickenham Stadium.   less self-aware [this lady's article people want get still manage grasp situation. cases area it’s located increased hundred cases two thousand 2 weeks.

Where seeing data? I'm seeing 113 confirmed cases, 1073 probable cases. 2016, went overseas first/only time far, possibly time know. soon plane took off, two teenage girls seated directly behind started coughing yelling, ""We're sick!"" friends. wondered dead bodies would capable spreading virus. Vaccines still 90% effective Delta. issue, biggest issue, unvaccinated population still remains large prevent community transmission. likely remain case 5-12 population high vaccination levels.

Here data region: people \~8x less likely become case (87.5% effective protection catching virus)

Vaccinated people \~46x less likely wind hospital (98% effective protection hospitalization).  course already here. many people flown to/from S.Africa time realized new, worse problem? Thousands? Hundreds thousands? That’s impression I’m getting well 24 hr urgent care centers around you? pocket charge way less ER. would try first. No, plenty countries sufficient supply. point supply problem South Africa, op obviously suggesting. wonder much cautious large amount population older. Maybe read comment confirm, barely half people mask up. see logic exists, thats similar line thinking covid would mutate vaxxed people get around immunity. think epidemiologists/virulogists/experts disproven sure?

I can't say much logic someone uneducated like actually sounds reasonable, I'm educated enough give accurate answer. reports South Africa indicate true, least vaccinated individuals. It’s anecdotal potentially biased, officials would likely true anyone else’s given proximity to, discovery of, Omicron. exactly happen NYT reporter said people world. It’s theory moment assumptions based small sample size (~100) South Africa showed strain 30 mutations. types mutations indicated higher transmissibility past research. South Africa also seeing general covid surge new strain thought cause (not everyone gets strain level testing, cases never strain specified). Bottom line: available evidence good hard empirical data exists variants actual outcomes population. know someone who... know someone knows someone who, actually know one even got breakthrough case... that's anecdotal. 

We months aggregate data breakthrough cases uncommon even uncommon get sick, hospitalized lasting symptoms. living secluded life chance become nothing thanca statistic realistic, point chances dying car wreck way bar catching covid bar get worst it. Considering thing Ive heard effects, relief. Yes, we're securing COVID-19 travel insurance top standard insurance. Luckily Spain, Qatar, UAE low infection rates, they've pretty high percentage vaccinated population. entry Qatar UAE particularly strict, negative PCR required boarding flight, testing upon arrival. 

There's certain level risk risk mitigation everything. point, probably going good I'm going get short revolutionary advance COVID-19 prevention. ""I would surprised... excuse me, go torture beagles, SCIENCE!"" UK thing.

Seriously, damnit (COVAX), hurry vaccinations ffs. Since quit, get jobs, checking customers grocery stores, see feels exposed many people everyday without vaccine. did. I?  Israel lead 

I read two weeks well 

This looks like far easily transmissible severe Yesterday got Moderna booster. Last night sleep headache day.

Just chest pain. decide go ER this, ends caused vaccine, need pay anything pocket care?

I'm debating go ER get checked out, case related myocarditis. applies everywhere, so...really kind obvious point make that's trying do. world banned travellers UK British scientists discovered Alpha variant. Countries hardly blamed banning travel circumstances, even overall benefits likely limited. think he's saying they're (""absolutely"") running circles hands air right now, worse ever.

But yeah, large parts news/media dismissive, ignorant confused science throughout pandemic. 

This pandemic chance step prove really important us always claim instead failed miserably name ratings. large media organizations could even said responsible deaths spreading misinformation, downplaying spreading FUD vaccines, etc.. Eh, kind like people otherwise healthy asymptomatic lose sense taste, excluding long termers. Basically harmless red flag stay home isolate. isnt. 

we dont know sick makes people. enough information yet. OP correct Um seen mortality rate? describing never going happen. virus kills virtually one age 80 extremely obese. Thanks response! hosts fight back apply selection pressure evading immune system? 

Wouldn't selection pressure evade immune responses help evolve infect people functioning immune systems? Make mandatory, time take kid gloves Oh convenient started spreading moment discovered it, clearly thought through... definitely understand that. hard care others, feel like others don’t care you. ever best. interesting datum approximately 20% South Africans HIV positive. might balance younger population, we're comparing immune responses countries.  Mandatory vaccinations like Austria Talk plan here. saw wrong. Pfizer even going done getting data one way three weeks now, hundred day clock might start.

In mean time, get booster get another hundred days what's big deal? caught covid year ago work - education, masking social distancing - I'm triple-jabbed. use N95 masks usually glad masks compulsory - theory least. know someone fully vaccinated still go hospital. exact mindset you. They're still five months later. ""bad cold."" 

I also know someone also went hospital they're still hard time going day. was, think seven months ago. Anyone know long PCR test results take? arent talking China’s complicity yet? West vigilant. Ah yes, redditors thinking playing Plague Inc. makes infectious disease experts. Officially know little new variant. early tell,more research needed take weeks. works hope information given soon.

The extreme,and countries unprecedented,measures beeing taken make citizens wonder going on. already see speculation comments upvotes get. quiet logical fair. precaution isnt convincing everyone either.  days still...

This exactly can’t say reason think might case. It’s way early tell. can’t draw conclusions yet. current rate spread pace overtake Delta worldwide within weeks. information lethality yet (so far 0 people died handful tested positive 2 weeks ago). Sure. I’m that. 

But change calculus daily life? employee immunocompromised I’d gladly let WFH. problem. 

But mean I’m selfish let kids go school despite risks? know vaccines work new variant. even sera neutralization studies yet. genetic code. 

You get booster quite likely live somewhere delta numbers currently increasing likely also boost immunity omicron become prevalent area.   submission removed either repost, clickbait low quality submission. Please review sub's rules, particularly rules 3, 5, 6.

But 78 FIL old enough even triple vaccination risks aren’t zero. What’s acceptable risk him? zero? age could also die something else seeing grandkids all. 

There lies rub.

We’re vaccinated. Triple adults. Working double older kid. enough county (San Mateo) acceptable risk? don’t know. sucks. 

On one hand yes, need push vaccines harder. articles saying need push unvaccinated kids outside eating quickly keep risks lowered vaccinated older adults. point trade mitigation insecurity others. Really? Push kids outside forcing eat quickly?

(I can’t find again. think NYT?)

Beyond vaccinating literally everyone house can, else do? Pull kids home homeschool? gets point guess could everything power what’s line? Thumbs marketing team coining name new covid variant. Omicron... sounds like name gigantic one-eyed half-alien/half-battle robot devourer-of-stars supervillain distant solar system toxic lava planets.

*Edit: positive, spell backwards get Norcimo.... sounds like name tiny, uber-cute fluffy unicorn. information yet. rate spread fast 95% people caught done last two weeks. worth noting South Africa could nearly 100% seroprevalence devastating Delta wave, numbers we're getting (0 deaths far, necessary expect yet) could *all* vaccinated prior infected people. Alpha exists way would without delta, gangs fighting territory. Sure somebody got delta catch alpha right away, know eventually comes around  mild healthy vaccinated people, seems like delta variant, little contagious. Unvaccinated people still high risk get ill  Promising early tell. There's handful cases older week two, young people probably previously infected. I'd like see hit fully vaccinated nursing home (okay sounded bad) everyone recover. Yes capitalism reason able access internet make post did. It’s reason vaccines come quickly. Think anyone would free? world. Hasn’t long claim anything yet. People distrust public PR people see evolution teleological/intentional Thanks this. Can't tell happy seeing words. think people thinking today March 12 (or whenever Hanks positive NBA canceled games). might like March 1st point. think US cases stop popping early week cases start blossoming everywhere next week. data. I'm it. (in US) plenty shots available people 5, two treatment pills coming up, need accept zero covid happening. Enough restrictions. think travel restrictions human rights violation point. Enough virtual school quarantine that. Continuing place restrictions people futile effort mitigate endemic virus infringing people's rights livelihoods. like much power given leaders. Variant discovered vaccinated people shamed wanting live lives despite case counts high / hospitalizations low restrictions vaccine restrictions eased new variant.

THIS. this.  wash hands eating? pooping? living sterile society !!! Well, got covid May, since fasting blood sugar levels showing consistently borderline 99 100.

Before covid, rarely sugar level crossed 80.

Don't covid age.
But then, I'm 25. completely misleading headline. actually read article, Israel literally 1 confirmed case Omicron right now. Yes, read right. One. 

That absurdly low amount data drawing conclusions from. got vaccinated last week. Decided kids scared. Glad age limit dropped. got covid way. Symptoms pretty mild youngest still ended hospital didn’t give boosters people whenever wherever? needs actual benchmark, otherwise, you’ll hypochondriacs getting boosters twice week. Get third dose safe. course believe real, politicians tell effective vaccine injustice true. data indicates vaccination produces far immunity time. Unless I'm understanding wrong, means OG coronavirus omicron (meaning pre vaccination) things would absolutely nightmarish, right? Thank fucking christ science correct, genetic testing especially viruses, viruses act different. even know omicron comes begin with.

But viruses work differently. never example herpes vaccine cure.

Herpes hides nerve cells immune system can't get to. immune system actually fights herpes really well comes back, fights since immune system can't go nerve issue generally speaking herpes hangs dormant agitation allows begin replicating again(it replicate nerves well hangs there).

But also Salmonella enterica causes Typhoid bacteria virus! asymptomatic likely means bacteria harming living dividing slowly body equiliberium.

The flu actually evolve crazy fast due works readily recombine nearly every event potential new variation virus, virus like COVID actually... relatively stable.

Really covid due machinery messing making mistake happens viable duplicating covid, slowest form evolution.

But got lot people, new virus lot different incubation chambers(people) different conditions variables make mistakes. clarify live different country family, international travel makes things complicated. assume immune escape get Omicron around 3 times contagious Delta, approaching level measles. course know nearly every antibody binding point changed, definitely immune escape.

If assume 100% immune escape (complete loss sterilizing immunity; note protective immunity drop somewhat B cells still going recognize it) 85% population immunity Johannesburg (best estimate) get Omicron half transmissible Delta. actually makes complete sense me: nearly every antibody binding point changed roughly expect, 25% daily rate spread nearly identical saw original covid winter 2020.  information suggest thing. one does. Narrator: wont US test variant? update testing overnight new Omicron cases found? certain small window testing, like airports?

Just curious Omicron would discovered US. got tested afternoon, would positive Omicron. Let's say got back SA yesterday hypothetically. ton mutations mutations suggest could strongly evasive antibodies elicited current vaccines Literally sub headline article says: omicron detected Israel, **experts add two weeks credible data variant's vaccine resistance.** Health minister says Israel preparing arrival new variant time

And there’s this: Health Ministry said Sunday morning, one woman Israel confirmed case omicron variant, already 12 suspected cases.

Apparently nobody entire thread actually read article **there literally 1 confirmed case Omicron Israel right now.** possibly legitimate set data draw conclusions from? hear you, work around people (yes, masks vaccines required) need know bad enough quit enough. studies seem indicate immunity acquired infection strong fades fast. Actually realized math wrong lmao. got second shot May, 6 months November, December. 🤦‍♂️ Nope inevitable current methodology Germany pinged app vaccinated symptomless self administer RAT, try second days later still asymptomatic. PCRs, self administered RAT. need illustrate bitches dude still arguing semantics fear mongering simple ""it fear mongering"" ""it fear mongering"".

Even get back must quarantine, jobs agree to. seems likely IMO, least next years virus reaches flu levels contagion mortality. Even then, fully expect good chunk people take vaccination health seriously never fully relax precautions, probably good thing since result less sickness communicable diseases.  dont wait booster. time next spring due another anyway. exactly. hell? chinese government suppress anything wants to, whatever measure force feels should. value judgment, case. notion CCP feels moral imperative ""tell truth"" laughable. 

""western"" countries might ""tell truth"" avoid pissing allies screwing things them. china calculus mind. supremacy oligarchs enforced directly- media violent social policing work explicitly concert there. particularly disguised there, US. Could could huge issue US people undiagnosed HBP?

I'm sorry, non-argument me. get lung transplant, incredibly privileged anyway. able adhere prerequisites able show hospital moment's notice. need pay expensive medical services medication. figure get easily available vaccine, definitely can't handle lung transplant. weirder still, since transplants often require vaccinated several things anyway. true anti-vaxxer chance receiving lung transplant need brainwashed people ruin rare gift.

They’ve moved speculating Covid? two cases Omicron Australia fully vaccinated. seen two dozen young, healthy people general practitioner, means she’s seeing onset symptoms. don’t see happen many people unvaccinated crazy enough believe anything Israeli's say. wonder they'll name greek letters used up. Maybe Alpha Alpha, Alpha Beta, etc. Alpha-2022. just: FUBAR-1, FUBAR-2... think pessimistic. 

1. yet know we're going need boosters regularly, so, intervals.
2. main logistic problem new illness, new vaccines needed. build capacity, keeping much smaller problem.

I agree logistics pain, boosters make problem worse, especially places bad infrastructure. OTOH, we're figuring out, developing new treatments. Life keep getting better. I'm far clinging hope. Mentally, I'm drained. 20 years ago. 70% known cases anti retrovirals. estimates 90% cases identified. everyone panicking Omicron? Data coming Israel suggestions vaccinated little worry about. I’m really sure else want say? Nah even politicized,
Most choices coming good voters like closing borders new variant make mayhem happened delta variant new variant

We're making policies like covid tornado hide basement hour two, tornado, idk good equivalent is, enough coffee yet, idk maybe murderhornets something. keep going lives leave basement. Quarantine long term? would pretty messed look lung transplants, feel like need one covid filled regret. 50% chance living another 5 years afterwards general, another 10 years best hope for. people counted 98% survive covid, I'm like really? infant child, live see child adult, probably even teen.

You new? never cool attitude. Erm, believe people, want helped, can't helped. regular boosters wjll protect people around you, feel important thing. I've noticed people support lockdowns one two extremes: people happily living spouse children, mentally ill people never went outside first place. pay taxes substance injected body.  Wasnt Johnson &amp;Johnson one dose? That’s could mean? play two screens simultaneously make Double Dutch. Honestly state vaccine denial best hope eventual end seems disease spreads like crazy doesn’t cause much damage. tends viruses mutate towards time. Let’s hope get lucky Well that's good news although wonder bit early celebrating. many cases talking here? long it? think that's say ""should"" instead ""will."" yeah let's exactly China downplay severity, variant continue spread. Wonderful advise, like chose learn nothing past couple years. there’s new vaccine resistant variant every three months that’s temporary, manageable crisis. That’s new normal. Note Fauci didn’t say fully evade still pushing vaccination first line defence. article, Francis Collins, director NIH, say: 

""We expect likely current vaccines sufficient provide protection,"" Collins said. ""And especially boosters give additional layer protection.""

…but hey, bleeds leads. please stop feeding alarmist half-truth garbage?

We might.  booster restores efficacy even faster--typically 7-12 days. Yes, hours articles started publishing anecdotes, articles publishing anecdotes young people getting sicker usual, requiring intensive care. don’t enough info yet. kind odd they're even making statement like they've tested current vaccines (Pfizer too) effective.

For context, I'm agnostic Israeli think highly ultra-orthodox's political stances. said, claim they're responsible anti-vaccination false case: perhaps first COVID still new taken seriously, situation flipped long ago.

Sure, certainly examined. mean reason everyone's suddenly concerned variant signs may transmissable reduce effect vaccines. case concerned new variant virulent. think people see lethal mutation, due way covered, there's reason predict that. Keep mind 61 samples tested yet. number might bigger 13.  many flight? updates far Well head far ass ivory tower academia, tend forget common peon below. - jaded researcher Preach it. peoples safety, control. People already double vaccinated pressured get third shot within 6 months. that's case ""vaccine"" working well it. Apparently there's agenda 8 shots total. know people double vaxxed refuse take shots, 2 enough. 


But places like EU soon world, going introduce vaccine passport expiration, get booster shot, wont able travel anywhere till renew passport getting booster. people mad. Also, initial spread within student population. definite sampling bias happening too. 

And general population average age 27. everyone knows, moving mountains hear understand. Yep. keep eye israel things. act, worthwhile pay attention, much fud fear

Ppl another varient, delta road

Get vaccinated think OP asking would variants die unless immune system adapts both. 

Like what's stopping Delta spreading Omicron exists? Can't co-exist bit slower, immune see disease.   wrong. One quotes GP, quotes head ICU hospital. would see different patients. Severe ones would go straight hospitals.  Big dick variant someone two vaccines, booster too, currently covid? MAX IMMUNITY? read genomic sequencing suggests Omicron older 2 weeks. Sept/Oct apparently. 

It wasn’t detected 2 weeks ago. can’t extrapolate R value that. already section there, look banner ""obvious truths"". Problem Idk worst anymore. go pretty dark. Chances I’m wrong won’t apocalyptic….I hope VG? info far vaccines still working it

I mean, follow link know beside Africa, 83 probably cases pretty sure vaccinated, way soon say vaccine still working. Also Still working, even mean term % Nah much impact spread directly. Much bigger factor age demographics country means 75% country largely young serious symptoms. Makes difficult trace. 

But AIDS impact deaths. potential mutations.

The labeled variant concern 2 days learning variant. Compare Delta first sequenced December 2020 labelled variant concern May 2021. Travel bans put place one two days discovery, [epidemiological say variant guaranteed big deal, best knowledge (which little point), seems enough risk mobilize good deal precautionary effort. vaccinated won’t get sick.

Omicron carries mutation similar changes sites two classes antibodies.

Thanks, hate it. Agreed. Covid wrecks obese. Wheres non stop media coverage asking people exercise? Nothing, take shot thats it.  Difficult tell without degree molecular biology. totally depends specifics mutations. 

There's lot FUD there, here's gist:

The original BionTech vaccine, well Moderna one vector vaccines, IIRC, target specific part virus, so-called spike. ingenuity lies fact spike makes virus special. mutation evades targeting also lose ""specialness"". Subtle changes spike protein lead gradual immune escape.

Testing vaccines safety one important goal: Demonstrate (for given dosage injection regime) mRNA ends places better not. (Triggering immune response critical areas might counter productive, theory). well proven problem. changing mRNA subtle manner require new safety trials. Efficacy could subtle, though. probably cannot simply add mRNA shot without expecting different immune responses thus different side-effects turn influence efficacy.

So think targeting new variant *that* straightforward. least probably try increase efficacy delta time. 

The actual programming mRNA specifically omicron done now. cannot simply patch vaccine, unfortunately. submission removed either repost, clickbait low quality submission. Please review sub's rules, particularly rules 3, 5, 6.

Tldr: morals and/or stupidity biggest issues. haven’t gotten makes think variant going change minds? already said variant shown mild symptoms without loss taste smell. 

This actually brings us little information, except new variant Ebola-deadly. enough time track severity.

Claiming COVID’s “not bad” death rate pretty irresponsible. Google hands like 15min chose keep oozing smarm. True, digging third bunker now. Oh good thinking! Let’s research!  ever would thought that? course it’s here. it’s everywhere ready, travelers (just about) everywhere soon.

Also, else flight *to* Doha, go? Pneumonia vaccine craziest. Targets 23 variants  Yes, way know it’s easy test using PCR Much already happened. already data vaccine efficacy (poor preventing infection, excellent preventing serious illness); already sequenced; already preparing test boosters targeting it. “Don’t make Google you”. typed words. Back early August, epidemiologist, Larry Brilliant, CNBC's Health Science segment. stated one group people needed booster shots ""right away"" 65 years old above; fully vaccinated six months ago, February 2021, weakened immune system. Brilliant quote: ""It category people we've seen create multiple mutations virus goes body."" 

Such people weakened immune systems include cancer, HIV patients, organ transplants. general, produce adequate immune response receiving two doses Covid vaccine.

 virus using bodies immunocompromised incubators/walking laboratories produce intense forms virus. rational presumption. don’t know! I’m saying scale it’s worth researching side effects minimizing them. 

Put another way: would prefer cause side effects purpose? course not. would loony.

More cases around world reported hour. Convenient. Thanks COVID got Moderna booster today it. last shot may 1 month late Fox News real news Spreading like wildfire now. new variant must highest transmission rate yet Nearly always. donno, feel like March 2020 controls would contained it. world reacted slowly importantly China tried hide it. 

The original strain much infective SARS MERS we've contained multiple times. 

The variants infective thing either Alpha Delta containable anymore 500 times infective original covid.

Wasn't 500% more, 6x? nothing sneeze at. (Really, please sneeze!) Please don’t spread false news. article say it’s spread everywhere world article misleading multiple fronts. First, antibodies matter, cells, despite entire focus article antibodies. article even admits much later time, decay disappear, leaving complex network B cells cells recognize respond viral invasion

Secondly, dishonest jump conclusion increased antibodies (which again, body's primary long term line defense) automatically leads greater protection, ""greater protection natural immunity"" matter. example, know prior studies natural immunity [broader immune vaccines, targets spike protein virus. example Omicron variant's spike protein sufficiently different due mutations (which speculating), would make precious little difference whether less antibodies, able identify nullify virus, making natural immunity protective. think concert bad, holds barred year now.

Sporting events like full capacity year. NFL College Football games easily 60,000+people per game.  Michigan -Ohio state full capacity today, 100,000+ people. strangers thinking number one: me. u/DeCondorcet paid Russian government disinformation troll spreading Covid misinformation guess would this:

When drop travel ban, people caught desperate situations. find way across border hell high water. 

Would rather that, people go customs testing/quarantine/tracking? That's true all. Especially booster something like 90% vaccinated completely immune Alpha, Delta, original strain. No. like alter it, suppose, often fear them. Equally alarming course. bet black plague lasted week lmao, keep acting like shit cold.  interest accuracy two plane loads passengers. gotta drum support boosters Look better masks hurt ears. comfortable others. 
And doubt singers actors keep wearing masks, even Japan. Yes, many seem understand antibodies necessarily mean protection. One study showed correlation antibody levels protection, certain amount there's proof confers protection. know right level is, different people different levels immunity different antibody levels. people naturally immune COVID without antibodies all, understand anything disease yet.

SARS patients 2003 strong immune response SARS virus without almost antibodies system. T-cells still able launch immune response 17 years later. US 48 million cases far Europe (the region) 82 million cases. number Europe also includes 10 million cases Russia, removed make comparable. Europe roughly 33% cases US far (48 vs. population may respond exact way population Europe.

I think wishful thinking. big empty states may benefit distancing virtue lot space. US would smart stop 4th wave gathers steam. sure would think that, vaccines stop catching COVID would obvious anyone knows vaccines work. fact asymptotic atleast bad news, even sample size extremely small thought 2 cases already reported? Sometimes. Also, sometimes not. new SA variant names 'nu' 'xi'?

I understand skipped logical order naming system 🤷

For love God, world going end keep things somewhat simple? Also, vaccinations stop testing positive COVID -- applies strain. new thing one. lot adults actually got RSV don’t even know rsv is. interest accuracy two plane loads point still stands. even less Omicron Persie's 1-7. Sure know 8 wonder what's first 7 Hopefully lot research done treatments sort thing, given many people experienced it.  Hold butts... virus keeps mutating forever. delta variant variants keep mutating forms another variant. new omicron variant also keep mutating (assuming near 100% likelihood spread isn’t stopped) create yet another variant. I’m planning fly Japan Dec (who knows that’s still going happen now) need negative pcr test 72 hours flight departs US Japan. thought worldwide? seeing lots first vaccine appointments mostly boosters? ""fact check"" dispute anything Israeli study. Plus studies show natural immunity protects well human body create anti-bodies spike protein, creates anti-bodies entire virus lends fighting variants. 

You're spreading much misinformation anti-vaxxers are. Every month come add ons like different hand sanitiser scents mask designs.  Oh! Sorry forgive ignorance pls! simply can't, 100,000 people cross boarders work day. could seed spike protein relatively harmless virus like 5 existing human coronaviruses. 

But yeah would worldwide engineered virus experiment. Whatever country released would worse North Korea Like said, anti vaxxers made bed. die care. vaccine available everyone, Mrna vaccines work.
Evolution give shit, others coming collect dues Antibody escape doesn’t mean much without context. 

The body produces MULTIPLE kinds antibodies t-cells primed react invaders quickly produce best-fit antibodies needed. 

Bedford right antibody escape. antibody escape isn’t complete failure vaccines case. 

I’m saying Bedford isn’t talented scientist. He’s quite good. you’re also understanding “immune escape” isn’t “immunity goes 0.”

Since like Twitter here’s bunch folks whose knowledge trustworthy: Bedford didn’t say ZERO immunity. past variants also demonstrated escape. Delta. vaccines work. Wtf. Slowing leak better leaving faucet on. nothing vaccinated people help kiddo Joke

Your head Right? I’m boat. Scheduled fly states middle December days I’m paranoid stuck way get back. Specifically insulin prices, price high US insurance system third party actors also wants earn money insulin.. Denmark insulin user pays around 800 dollar year supply.. understand people exhausted, looking silver lining, one currently vaccines reduce hospitalizations deaths (a MAJOR boon). problem many conflate draw bigger picture COVID spread, probably largely justify reasons taking precautions. (Again, exhaustion, get it.)

PS: thanks! Yes, without consent.  US sequences heavily especially high population states like California, Texas, Florida, New York. still take week two sequences get reported.

Relative US, South America reported far fewer sequences GISAID last 3 months. South America still reported 6 times many sequences last 3 months Africa.  There's like 70 proteins virus. changing mean antibodies stop working. 

The bigger concern vaccine antibody effectiveness targets one protein one state. Anecdotal, perhaps illuminating personal experience. 

When mid twenties, contracted common cold. Felt like shit week made normal recovery. days feeling normal again, collapsed work extreme chest pain. Incredibly, Dr/EMT couple happened right actually diagnosed correctly spot took hospital. 

The coronavirus kicking spread heart muscle, causing pericarditis later pneumonia. remember physician saying something lot like ""I know sounds scary, know feel awful, going fine"". right. explained things kinda happen sometimes. lot rhyme reason effected. 

I healthy athletic, rarely got sick. cold normal cold. Even worse president refusing seen one spreading misinformation. Children 12-17 authorized booster yet time frame. right thing, available while. sorts data signals, shady fuck. 

Maybe picked radio chatter South African EMT's something really understand Americans living inside bubble prosperity fellow citizens receiving high efficacy vaccines courtesy US government like are.

Many us military veterans served country yet, people feel deserving good vaccines would rather us receive low efficacy vaccines ... places like CHINA ...

... EVEN THOUGH RESIDE COUNTRIES US GOVERNMENT SENDING VACCINES TO, MENTIONED ARTICLE ...

I accepted people spit American War Vietnam era wore USMC issued uniform attached amphibious USMC force recon unit US Navy Corpsman, I'm frankly shocked people like whose main duty serving country provide aid comfort sick injured think deserve every American citizen receiving free home.  Wuhan1 ancestral strain containable either. may pattern here. always been. city population explosion decade ago one traffic congested cities world. get panic attacks even thinking stepping house.. alphabet use next? true. Vaccine manufacturers aim B grade (intended reduce severity). aim grade (prevent infection) limited time global emergency, B grade gets rolled it’s still incredibly life-saving. clinical trials approved basis preventing symptomatic infection, hospitalisation (too people trials got hospitalised). mRNA vaccines basically achieved grade, Delta came along modified grade B. Also waning immunity. I’m waiting weeks see Pfizer effective omicron. said know 2 weeks  Yet J&amp;J traditionally produced vaccine none get either. I'm sure tv provide new set excuses soon Shows difference antigen test pcr. flight got antigen test, people negative result could board.

After flight everyone got pcr test, 10% people tested positive.

It definitely shows flying still pretty big risk.  think moving mythical goalposts? That's good headache pictures! strain transmissible fear

They know is. studying it. us small children can’t vaccinated yet. probably would detected sequencing spreading around world. See [nextstrain/ncov](http://nextstrain.org/ncov/global). Hover mouse pointer samples see sequenced. Plenty sequencing happening around world. Taipei? practically is. understand though, billionaires running place need make money somehow. long takes microchip travel heart? new variant studied, possibly features allow evade antibodies. understand science works? sound like do.  Sounds like unvaccinated pre-existing condition. far I'm aware there's much confirmed variant yet, like know transmissibility, severity, resistant, etc. getting worried bc reactions virologists epidemiologists governments. maybe possible regardless variant entails, everybody mentioned would've jumped immediately like *regardless* bc bad Delta want risk another variant spreading capacity? 

idk? random thought? know anything anything. wear mask, sanitize, vaccinated, stupid, well versed point.   flight *from* South Africa... Okay, everyone done circlejerking anyone actually look information?

Identifying reaffirming risk factors absolutely reasonable line enquiry.  Consider testing antibodies. never symptoms; never missed day work. several exposures, believe *would not* antibodies. drops blood confirmed point, indeed. tested positive Covid IgM IgG. US place. Michigan masks worn doctors offices hospitals... Nevada last week pretty strict everywhere indoors Also keep mind Schiphol airport major hub international travel. 60% incoming passengers transfer passengers. Normally sees 70 million travellers year.

Everything that's detected Netherlands among passengers wherever spread globe time detected.

And stopping two plane loads total 600 passengers testing great data point, weeks Omicron detected planes South Africa flew scheduled.  Absolutely reduced total impact however China big country even China high vaccination rate better known drug treatment regimes, numbers still extremely shocking months due population size alone.  Also keep mind Schiphol airport major hub international travel. 60% incoming passengers transfer passengers. Normally sees 70 million travellers year.

Everything that's detected Netherlands among passengers wherever spread globe time detected.

And stopping two plane loads total 600 passengers testing great data point, weeks Omicron detected planes South Africa flew scheduled. stopped traveling long, yet keeps going around world. wrong?  so, testing still allows lot sick people travel. one remember China covered Covid lied severity virus? Thus magnitude effects felt whole world. 

Seriously fuck Chinese Communist Party. vaccine help spreading virus. live life.

This mean need fly around world everything hold — point, need learn live COVID. 

Not travelling fun ""everything"". point, learn live Covid, obviously yet.

Maybe people like finally reduce luxury travel - also terrible environment, cares, travel?

.... reason always, Fauci good trusted source. need multiple heads several nations, guy hiding tracks spewing BS science. Ah ok. given come back omicron?  matter sample size now, still much bigger media two days ago printing headlines ""be afraid"" ""we going die"". tell it’s possible tested negative left tested positive arrived Nope, says person developed symptoms. learning time. seems like (in America) serious keeping variant out, need figure way make sure citizens aren’t infected spreading they’re home

You cannot ""keep virus out"" America. impossible. I'm starting think omicron world wide weeks now. Time start resequencing old data check. done sequencing yet. cases absolutely still come. Sorry, quite understand first part. mean infections general low Delta 99% doesnt mean much?  matter variant 100% chance successfully killing everyone so.many people Florida wear masks change thing. united States full selfish people I've ever seen. Makes want go live Europe. bottom one really say much article doesn't. message still basically unvaccinated people showing severe symptoms vaccinated people. confirm. nurse, it’s really difficult. hoping you’d see /s know sarcasm. gonna do.  cousin’s boyfriend’s nut sack. so, 30% people odd non specific physical issue covid. ok.. that's probably people. muscle strain.. pulled back.. something.. could anything  PCR tech still blows mind, that's incredibly specific. Another question, mind: Omicron descended Alpha? know outside Delta clade, forget Delta came Alpha. That’s great except continual overwhelm health care system US countries.   Here's archive link, starts spreading like virus, could say. asymptomatic ffs. Here's archive link, starts  people need learn live covid ffs . maybe learned Delta took precautions  country obligation pay medical treatments countries? France pay HIV treatment Brazil? Russia pay ringworm treatment Netherlands? No. country government charity. need serve needs citizens first always.  people keep moving goal post ? know effect vaccines variant doom panic . SYMPTOMS???? Ahh, suspense. (if says article, apologize. Can’t read German) Fuck unvaccinated, sideways. German health minister Spahn said everyone's thinking. new 3G rule (geimpft, genesen, getestet = vaccinated, recovered, tested) become geimpft, genesen, gestorben (vaccinated, recovered, deceased). moved Australia, amazed little basic geography Aussies know actually blame assuming know?  I’d rather enjoyed Christmas mate 

(Nothing bequest that’s waiting folks kick bucket) 

Nah shouldn’t joke remind extremely rare deaths serious cases covid children. children underlying conditions, would vaccine helped? Maybe.. Approximately 1/3 child cases healthy children.

I agree need vaccinated. let's sit act like young children going playing field older folks 50.

1 child death many. going get 0 covid deaths worldwide vaccine regardless.

The children fine. Let's right thing make sure vaccine safe first. It'll come soon enough. It'll help fully prevent. Actually that's true. blame Trump way medical experts lying public. 

However, understand decision would run out, think lie wrong one, I'd lie. could come slightly whiter lie, like cloth masks effectiveness n95 medical masks, save medical community typically used. way could easily reverse course later easier, less harm would done around. don’t see couldn’t get booster variant. immunity wouldn’t hurt anything wouldn’t think. expert. Plus rollout would probably age group/immune health/occupation again, would take 2 weeks eligible, right? think border closures made whim leaders themselves? What's actually sad think life without freaking restaurants worth living way lol. Seems modern science protecting many Darwin effect. 

So many people want every advantage living society, none obligations. Umm..are saying blood vessels near deltoid muscle? 

If special knowledge human anatomy, might want contact scientists tell spread 10.1136/postgradmedj-2021-139870

http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40545-021-00315-w Yes, problem. seems important 61 COVID-19 cases found, 13 omicron. summer earlier news seemed like 61 we're omicron. Could misreading though... safe say thing spread around world already.

Hold tight everyone... evidence milder. evidence severe. everyone freaking then? vaccines seem work new strain. Fear mongering? They've got lot fireworks sell! good point. Let's hope outcompete delta. delaying years, vaccines place prevent deaths. also possible dedicated drugs available following one year two. COVID becomes real seasonal flu like hcov-oc43. Count one people. Considering cancelling flights 12hr+ drive instead limit exposure. 9mo old… Lol mate taking piss. know live haha vaccinated person virus don’t develop symptoms that’s sign vaccine working. 

Not 100% certainly - many asymptomatic cases vaccines even developed.  According ThermoFisher, even deletion Spike 69/70 may causing negative read. Alpha Omicron that. sure mean. world hasn’t closed? mean Australia? Thanks, thought info sounded weird find sources haven’t read experts recommending border closures. saying amnesty international lying ? never understood hate Marshall much. He's got cutest fish jokes. stay 2021 want. want out! Delta 99% low incidence. peaked incidence low comparable incidence like Europe now.

People saying could reinfection age group different infected again, reinfection hypothesis might true. live west coast then? west coast Indian. East coast Tasman, south great Australian bight Australia within Pacific.

Copy pasted region made thousands islands throughout Central South Pacific Ocean. includes Australia, smallest continent terms total land area. Australia Oceania Pacific, vast body water larger Earth’s continental landmasses islands combined.  wasn’t. said cases increased hundred thousands. Really good drown variants weaker or?   also get tinnitus jaw clenching teeth grinding night, wouldn’t surprised Covid something   actually reason believe less virulent. South Africa previously infected even though 5% tested positive; nearly zero antibody neutralization would expect reinfections norm (like breakthroughs) would expected mild. Additionally, known cases 2 weeks old, handful 1 week old; previous variants took multiple weeks get severe outcomes simply expect yet. may single confirmed case someone without prior infection/vaccination yet, unlikely go back couple days. think website called stuff co nz reliable. Maybe US, head infectious disease agency Germany called ""deeply concerning"". 

But Germany neck-deep 4th wave right transmissible variant would disastrous. vaccines causing variants. can’t people. mutations occur replication. Someone immune system fight virus replicating weeks, depending. Someone immune compromised could host virus months- time it’s replicating self over, eventually mutations appear build time get variant different enough. whether difference something harmful less isn’t really virus. mutates, advantageous mutations it’ll spread more, they’re not, they’ll outcompetes original strain go nowhere. whose **antibodies were** measured weeks getting second dose vaccine, they’re close peak. **53 times higher group 76 unvaccinated people recovered COVID-19 two six weeks earlier.**

..well little... 53x... That's insane. Bay Area, get apointment week now. option right would get ""first dose"" booster, 6 months roughly December 11.  World War Z shit. time it’s identified, they’ve already made another variant lab whelp, guess showed lack Geography Knowledge Africa. Stupidly assumed same. virus adapts kill host peak worse ever seen. one extra scary. I've always said this, I'm often afraid way people react bad things things themselves.

I afraid people would react 9/11 terrorist attacks. write, fallout 9/11 far worse 9/11 itself.

And today, continue fear people's reactions Covid Covid itself. feels like life never going return pre-covid, like world never returned pre-9/11 normal. share story? curious effects still bother almost two years Yeah anyone saying less severe grasping straws. almost certainly deadly takes delta. basically back beginning unvaxed. I'm already stocking long cold quarantine winter. unvaccinated want get vaccine, force them. hasn't. kinda love hate I’be learned enough communicable diseases last year understood that.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* don’t think need to. least US. Well luckily still thing called immune system ffs.  read morning variant detected EU, England parts middle east, Israel, Arabian Emirates.There's doubt North American continent. pandemic proven it. pretty much immobilized Ebola sinks it’s teeth Also, tried say outside safe, suddenly they're finding masses deer covid antibodies.

Yea wild animals carry sorts pathogens anyway. deer SARS-CoV-2 change big picture much. probably wide array various coronaviruses wild animals. Dr. Whomst Explain please, moment Masks required medical facilities state since first mask mandate. said, opened visitors non-emergency patients pretty much required every facility then.

At grocery stores, stopped little bit vaccinated, case numbers rose, realized probably best keep wearing masks truly essential businesses regardless pandemic status. God bless work right now. Or…”how dangerous is”. See difference fear mongers ""laymen's terms"". course here. spreading constantly unvaxed. basically back beginning ruined progress made. time need stop nice start forcing shot getting unvaxed away public access spread it.   Sir r/coronavirus skipping Xi taken advantage of. ""They skipped Xi look pockets China"". mean probably unfriendly China, also world police, understandable playing safe. Xi also sounds lot like ""she"". Dont think She-Variant would great idea either.

The greek alphabet bad idea IMO, messy intransparent. I'm hiding house another two years, that's it. course is, FFS. 

What everything seen learned last two years tells us anything different? It’s virus, adapt! It’s going away. believe this? deserve downvotes imo. correct way, Omicron less harmfull.

I Swiss shitshow here. Low vax rate, lot protest masks, vaxx certificate, etc. proved handle pandemic well fear go like that.
A less dangerous variant best chance. Let's hope turns like this. seems blocking Delta pretty effectively SA moment. final mark. Imagine  biggest key respond week so. persists woth tired affects unvaccinated looking major diminishment severity COVID. may also alook coronaviruses arose diminshed past still around today cause common cold. experts virology, epidemiology, microbiology social behaviour Perhaps access vaccine. lab leak conspiracy theorists now? I’m waiting say “50 mutations! way could happened naturally.” Well guess what, that’s viruses typically well - mutate.    ones feel need visit doctor. symptoms mild subgroup infected significant. in, water wet. Isn't/wasn't Mu variant interest variant concern? Honestly, wish US guts ban non essential travel idea potential impact new mutant virus could have.

People want ""follow science"". time scientists come around, behind curve (like boosters.) Israel saw waning problem acted mainstream public health people working denial. 

I think act first ask scientific questions later. completely false. majority years, flu shot less 50% efficacy according fact, last 16 years, half flu shots 40% less efficacy. idea process refined also true, 2018-19 one lowest efficacy rates ever 29%.

Why would clear trend change coronavirus shots? haven’t gotten flu we’ve trying decades. That’s unfortunate. friend mine got pericarditis booster. Take care. ""...and interested learning.""

Some even destructive anti learning too.

And wants actively live like pseudo savages.  What? Can't smell it. ~~axe~~ TDAP! N95s still keep out, size particles changed. there's reason think omicron resist B cells, problem antibodies, going right back immunologically naive. Unless significantly immunocompromised, really ok. There's many reasons. Control one. think fear government always bad thing, think government fully interests kind naive Actually getting ill good getting vaccinated. I'm surprised they've gotten 3 times all. article talking myocarditis Covid infection vaccination. risk myocarditis infection significantly higher vaccination. need get Facebook dude, lmao thing happened me. gone 72 hours. say learned live it, mean species adapted protection, right? Even so, surprised quick market recovered April 2020 think get huge crash now. surely wrong though. seems many experts ""deeply concerned"". mean panic, also mean nothing worry about. Americans selfish, self-entitled, pricks... ike dw ja isn't? fu bot lol experts I've heard said wearing masks protecting yourself, around you.

Experts listen say vaccines far best way protect others Covid. 

If ""those around me"" worried catching Covid passing strangers grocery store choose wear N95 mask. curent wave delta. They're checking regularly. here? read taken context patients young healthy affected previous variants. spend lot time commenting posts subreddits probably scroll past, singular event? Bruh stop already. Come on. however ebola largely contagious severe symptoms set - point patient hospitalized close death.

covid spread significantly symptoms appear there's less evolutionary pressure covid evolve less deadly. see panicking people new variant wanted post thing wrote local Covid subreddit yesterday:

---------------
Reasons yet started panicking, paying attention it: 

1) South Africa overwhelmed cases means, percentagewise took delta -- little community transmission even delta, hard surpass level delta transmission. 

2) seen take foothold another country outcompete delta

3) new antiviral pills probably work well this

4) would residual effect vaccination even variant, mean vary spike protein much bind ACE2 receptor more.

5) see start outcompete delta anywhere, would hopefully reason rethink mRNA boosters -- start tailoring delta, variant, others, hard do.

6) stopped wearing mask public work, kids still school, still work well (if ever comes shores).

7) saw lambda outcompete delta Peru, never really took become worldwide menace

I bet variant eventually traced someone chronic Covid. way get many sudden mutations. new antivirals also deployed immediately given chronic Covid patients, prioritized among anyone else. viruses technically alive, reproduce, evolution put pressure virus evolve infectious enough spread, high mortality rate. SARS bad virus, died rather quickly high mortality rate, well able infect many since contracted SARS, chances icu within 24 48 hours. like Covid asymptomatic presymtomatic week symptoms.   [B cells You’ll still test positive you’re infected. thing happens vaccine immune system produces specific antibodies response vaccine. stick around eventually diminish. However immune system immune ‘memory cells’ remember invasive proteins it’s encountered long time start producing new antibodies next encounters proteins (or similar ones). would not. majority primo HIV infection asymptomatic PLWH remain asymptomatic years. Plus, HIV 100% treatable 2021. think issue necessarily whether severe, whether vaccinated people likely get one symptoms all, leading health care overload. ebola, main concern main reason authorities cautious health care system limited abilities. transmissible Delta relatively similar impact, that's still enjoyable addition. Looks like backstroke, sir.  it’s transmissible think won’t far off. Clotting doesn’t mean death. Long haul covid effects cripple society. I'm point think factory lab pumping new variants. freaking ridiculous. could. happens new variant mutates something deadly, made super-covid. would ever take risk. world's governments collectively grow set ovaries, never end. I’m going December take wife broadway starts Texas A&amp;M. vaccinated worried stuff shut next weeks. Still spreading nonsense, China’s response latched onto Jan. 11 date publication evidence cover-up: why, ask, didn’t Zhang publish Jan. 5, first finished fact, Zhang insists first uploaded genome U.S. National Center Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Jan. 5—an assertion corroborated submission date listed U.S government institution’s Genbank. “When posted genome Jan. 5, United States certainly knew virus,” says. take days even weeks NCBI look submission, given gravity situation buoyed urging colleagues, Zhang chose expedite release public, publishing online. (Approached TIME, Holmes deferred Zhang’s version events.) It’s decision facilitated swift development testing kits, well early discussion antivirals possible vaccines.*

You thanking Chinese doctors like Zhang Yongzhen vaccines tests COVID developed fast, due working without breaks 48 hours sequence first genome virus. informed US 5 Jan 2020, published everything online 11 Jan 2020. Xi even told US president virus phone call. blame THREE MONTHS inaction followed despite China's warnings. all, also given cases. think probably see more. true universally, vaccinated non. random dumbass cannot meaningful research though. need expert actually interpret data. even read it? It’s explaining different scenarios. wish would track mutations influenza paste news social media daily/weekly basis. Lmao. Pull ur hand sand man… 30% suffer psychosoma. Appropriately Trump ratio, except they're hypochondriacs. Canada forcing public servants back office even though productive working home primarily mayor capitol city wants downtown core get better even though many public servants even worth downtown. 

 members Parliament continue working remotely safety reasons. heard mutated name O'Rudy something.  sustainable. know many people used take guidance seriously want live life. selfish people

It's actually behavioral trait *American exceptionalism*. one deal second line anything.  Netherlands 17 mil people, Germany 84 million people mean, never going mutate flu know mean. Here's hoping. one hear Omicron COVID-19 Lurr’s voice Futurama? think forgetting something: China. Thee ole thrill party comment. 🙄

The party over. Wake friend. leadership programs stop pandemics 100 years States. Even longer countries. 

All sudden theses mandates/program/standards work? 

 Serious questions need asked. Questions scare people.

Questions like, BELIEVE CENTURIES OLD SCIENTIFIC PROOF DEALING DISEASE. Followed by, TOLD INFORMATION GETTING IT. picking I'm putting down? pandemic response suffering SABOTAGE. 

Refusal answer result serviceman woman escorted brig. Separated unit. 

Huh, Choice? Freedom, military? news people. Let use Disney song explain military life.

""Its whole new world"".

I fun parties way. I'm sick gas lit all. 90% said aware status 68-71% antiretrovirals, 87% virally suppressed. SA aggressive antiretroviral program.  think know works.

Turns phrase shortcuts.

Only thing matters replication. Thanks this. Clinging hope find 😔 22k average, 5x many germans swampgermans. didn't. There's N. game next Greek letter sequence skipped Nu sounds like new confusing. Xi pronounced Chi confused China. skimmed article clear - definitely mean 133% *more*, 133% *as*? 2.3x 1.3x? agree. Starting learn public reaction news largely predictable, even challenging times. really comforting.  They’re troops imagine obese, diabetic, asthmatic, pages upon pages medical issues. Y’know standard stuff armed forced don’t weed all. Around 20k day according worldometer. Germany number one daily infections quite  healthcare system definitely fine. Good thing didn’t. Thank dark humor. someone burnt depressed, put smile face. :) skipped Nu Xi, pretty obvious why. 30 CONFIRMED cases sent home “isolate” isolated hotel… ones sent home, know one end fuck us… numbers severe/critical cases daily deaths risen rapidly, unexpected. speculated immunity elders received vaccines earlier year diminished. get right antibody tests right time. struggle.  monthly boosters. Plsss Don’t know downvotes, bc you’re absolutely correct - username correct 🤣 100% correct.

Hospitals fill unvaccinated patients even faster didn’t update Delta? least boosters? (Perhaps lethal VoC lurking around corner). . u Omg it’s Omicron!!!!!!! sequenced 13 far Omnicron that's 100% far. Also, still Delta around Omicron, get vaccines boosters protect getting sick. Life certainly changed. always course, time seems even noticeable not-so-young life. They're receiving lessons though. They're throwing blame wherever long themselves. Though like that's stopped virus reproducing EU US. news needed. much spreads issue vaccines still making easy illness handle. said thing version drawn panicky.  Get booster soon can.

I got mine two weeks ago two days later kid got symptoms. tested positive whole time. home test first PCR later negative.

You never know get contact it.  masks do. 

So combination vaccines masks deter spread virus. 

Are saying two don’t? Luckily, there's money line. Pharmaceutical companies sustained regulatory enforcement scrutiny. know many observers would like see even scrutiny, know experience (white-collar criminal defense attorney) pharma companies take risk exposure seriously subjected investigations could lead jail time mistakes. 

The companies deliver solutions COVID-19 get-out-of-jail-free pass, similar leeway. Enforcement agencies listen ""It good-faith mistake,"" argument made company simultaneously curing/treating/diagnosing COVID-19. 

Success COVID-19 could grant pharma execs sense security desperately want. comes actually successful. Anything sets us back (such misrepresenting success) hammered DOJ agencies. yeah can, dunno guy making big ordeal, days finished 2020 (where actually go home come back without japanese citizenship) broad statement, [most Covid infections fully meaning without ""disease"" portion infection, virus able spread general population without much issue remaining sidelined sick individuals. know much least weeks/months. Scientist began working immediately. Vaccination shown lessen long covid strains. hopefully.  I'm disagreeing denying anything. Omicron scary. trying understand right now. Say tell asteroid collision course Earth, hit tomorrow evening. 70% chance burn atmosphere cause damage, 30% chance wipe life earth.

Would freak out? Chances likely non-event. Would fear-mongering report event? aren’t vaccinated. That’s entire problem. tired argument used everytime article like comes up. pReXiStInG cOnDiTiOnS!?! Like yeah, valid matter much. People still dying need carelessness anti-vax misinformation. dont think anyone denies reasonable line inquiry. We're tired hearing argument anytime people die covid. appreciate write up. comforting me. Thanks! Well tell it’s Omicron variant, probably tell strains well. travelers coming South Africa going particular variant Delta seemingly fizzled hence new variant popped completely honest, care whether anti-vaxxers live die. want stop anti-vaxxers one way another; whether means becoming science-trusters becoming corpses entirely them.  Believing anything coming China juvenile.. we’ll never know real origins virus number deaths. 800k deaths China everyone would know, silly. cannot hide bodies, cannot genocide without fleeing refugees. beaten house morning. Three neighbours already outside, starting cars.  34 yo coworker caught Covid back December 2020. survived it, probably gone hospital. lungs scarred, nearly passes slightest physical exertion. used extremely fit, gained significant amount weight year long Covid kicked ass.

Yet, still refuses get vaccine, instead claiming natural immunity protect him. even filed religious exemption employer's vaccine mandate. Well, hospital Covid slowly declining I'm you. even possible percentage positive? traveling restrictions--are completely ignored KLM, apparently enforce masking, either? steady percentage previous flights, new? many questions news. noted sample young healthy people though. Thank you. thought, probably name.the new variant Omnicron It’s close January 2020. Isnt 50% population rural areas? know absolutely nothing certain. even know many Uyghurs missing China, makes people think could know pandemic information? Yeah never get arguments. It’s almost 2 years now. Might well live one dictatorships didn’t allow leave (e.g. east germany). be, isnt necessarily. contagious asymptomatic, die 3 weeks later complications - isnt evolutionary disadvantage virus. Well, that's yes/no. 

A vaccinated person test positive - test negative, would indicate immune response vaccination. 

An unvaccinated person positive result indicates past infection - symptomatic asymptomatic.

At time test, yet vaccinated. tested positive antibodies prior eligible since gotten J&amp;J/Janssen. Like someone said

If Omicron (that name btw) proves infectious less deadly variants, shit keeps evolving following pattern, could mean end pandemic covid common flu one day.

Keeping fingers crossed Here’s simple, fundamental question: vaccine work?

If works, shouldn’t matter people travel. Particularly combined measures like masks etc. 

If don’t work another problem. 

The solution can’t whole world goes lockdown that’s simply sustainable global economy. 

We family world it’s silly keep people hostage.

So policies need based either vaccine working vaccine working. can’t both. believe means person tested positive covid develop symptoms initially. countries, Japan included, people tested positive still hospitalized prevent infecting others considered patients. mean, like HIV? Absolutely, I’m trusting Israel fullest anything COVID related. question trust. case, actually believe doctors absolutely true. doctors different perspectives treating different populations people.  wave coming 6 month mark vaccinations seem recent.  That's tests available early on. tests available later used live patients, dead ones.

What know certain China's total deaths COVID nowhere near 800k. China, despite 4x population US, despite developing country less effective healthcare, despite country COVID first discovered less deaths self-proclaimed human rights champion US A.

There big wave spread across entire country killed millions entirety Wuhan quarantined scale called ""authoritarian"", ""draconian"", ""controversial"" etc. gamble paid [we idea] current vaccines work it.

This ill-defined statement.

It *extraordinarily unlikely* (and essentially expert believes) drop vaccine efficacy, especially severe disease, zero.

However, also *almost guaranteed* vaccines least slightly less effective variant. We've seen many mutations before, know (at least individually).

**What know effective current vaccines be.**

(This different statement yours.)  Paging Dr Zuckerberg  pisses whole pandemic simple cost benefit analysis wholeheartedly ignored many people. clear Masks Shops Transportation much less invasive setting like bar often ignored policymakers countries.   people didn’t keep masking hot plane hours tarmac. people negative test fly proof vaccination? know what's going Michigan. We're tire fire cases currently. Although breakthrough cases thing. know lots people gotten recently (including wife) vaccinated. never said vaccine working. response 100% based assumptions lack interest others ask questions. Yes, Amnesty International lying. 

If read article states Israel isn’t providing vaccine people Gaza West Bank. would they? Palestinians Israelis. governments, laws, justice system, police, hospitals, schools, etc. 

Either Palestinians sovereign countries aren’t. cant sovereign *and* expect Israel provide them.  high score number viruses produced. Killing people worth points.

They going drag us down.  Nice checking already world. deaths serious illness. see something say otherwise I'm concerned. Obviously restrict international travel especially unvaccinated, sound bad seeing loss taste smell. problem feel people don’t mind restrictions able lock us indefinitely. sound stupid way, travellers need PPE/BSL4 suit travelling, way least containment effect.

And also aircraft/airport disinfectant program mechanism 100%. I'm sorry, realize morally superior SOOOOO much mature! Good grief, blinded.

Fully valued inquiring I'm military veteran many ppl get conditions service. wanted know detected got get abused downvoted reason. 

The sad part part still wonder can't convince others order end pandemic. 

Hint: see why. need update.

The boosters 95% effective (as compared two-doses! like 98% effective compared unvaccinated people) symptomatic disease, would update?

Moderna, least, designed delta booster (took like day) chose produce needed. I'm sure Pfizer same.

There downsides modifying vaccine make boosters--most notably, I'm sure would disrupt production current vaccine, world desperately needs of. Yes, production capacity 100 million per month, take years give world. BioNTech Novavax also investigating variant specific vaccine, production capacity finite, would take many months see variant specific vaccine readily available. spend lot time commenting posts subreddits probably scroll past, singular event? one blaming SA. monitoring picked first place.  Hi! worries! Yes, pretty common occurrence. I'll happy find sources DM them--it's really ""standard"" expectation/knowledge study viruses. suck overall unfortunately past eradication stage thanks to...things. I'll reference flu re: death count. given us ""acceptable"" standard average deaths flu. never eradicated. COVID likely go given supplied much opportunity evolve far rapid rate typical coronaviruses (a years). idea course hospitals overwhelmed every year flu, world shutting either. got vaccines treatments across board keep people well help get it. goal point probably get COVID. I'd glad hear international travelers checked easily transmissible illness. Yeah ongoing court case topic. whats point? literally said ""i got vaccinated"" lol tf mean fully vaccinated answer “do vaccines work not” isn’t sample. current vaccines designed original Wuhan variant, especially Pfizer Moderna work great that. also work well Alpha. less effective Delta, they’re even less effective variants like Beta Mu fortunately weren’t transmissible Delta. way, also problem convalescent serum immunity prior infection monoclonal antibodies.

We may need vaccines updated particularly variants. Pfizer vaccines Alpha Delta Phase 2 trials aren’t generally available.

References neutralization loss different variants: Planas et al Uriu et al (see Figure 1C), Li et al (see Figure 1 particular, current concern Omicron might foreseen “yellow”), Liu et al Pan et al Harvey et al different point: (high-skill) essential workers adequately appropriately supported? instance, paid exposed workplace ordered quarantine work? might assume yes, least cases answer *no*. Also, prioritized vaccination? medical personal, places answer *no*. instance, USA, Biden Administration forced states prioritize educators, “CDC Phase 1B” in-person non-medical essential workers mercy states, states gave priority in-person non-medical essential workers. Yes must *taken* within 72 hours, plan accordingly. Lol, way miss point.

The sad thing enjoy certain things. sad thing seem able comprehend certain activities enjoy (eg. going restaurants) essential requirements every single person enjoy life, many people mind much activities restricted.

Please learn less judgemental, people different interests. matters much, doubt first plane infected anyways.  Gottleib Sunday show bit, Fauci Sunday Show appearance finally said first time he's part we're going live camp.

He basically said point, he's working metric standard go make people comfortable possible, he's come accept virus going eliminated, going spread way another years years, wants figure get others come terms live life best can. would murder.  actually read article posted? says nothing Israel “starving” Gaza vaccines. anything tried get vaccines people Gaza sooner supposed get July, Pfizer, Israel Palestinians attempted vaccine swap, Palestinians would receive hundreds thousands soon-to-expire Israeli doses exchange Palestinian shipment expected arrive months later.  Variants competition other. best transmitting crowd others matter what. go look cases original Covid strain. won’t find anymore. No, didn't.

You statement implies some, reasonable possibility vaccine efficacy drop zero.

My statement *do know* vaccines *will work*. know quite well. Nobody 'blaming' South Africa.

South Africa remarkabky open honest new variant. They've handled situation well.

Yes, air travel shut down. accusation shape form. appreciate way SA handled bad covid been, experience interesting. never expected see birth new seasonal virus lifetime.  protests lockdowns small minority. say calm fuck let science thing. takes time.  ""extra scary""? Reports show infected people mild symptoms, even compared original variant tells us initially look potent especially smell taste symptoms absent. Travel restricted, i'm certainly concerned emerged variant. response far see them, luckier side fell on.

If someone said immature I'd genuinely think instead *carry brat*. Lol Even amongst unvacinated chances 'screwed' incredibly low unless old compromised another way. vaccine absolutely working. That's people dying going hospital nearly much unvaccinated.

Just people catching it, mean working. vaccine keeps getting severe covid, getting completely. 

As far pre-existing conditions, likely going find out, again, considering NONE fully vaccinated, I'm going back previous comment - unvaccinated pre-existing condition. facetious. unvaxxed ones dying right now. dunno UK, I'm US. even need doctor's approval here, buy direct lab $40. UK direct consumer lab testing? Yep. irony asking legit questions research. ilogical. *eyeroll* 

I forgot questions allowed days. 

I bet ppl like know all. Thanks! West : Donate vaccines Africa







Africa : nothing Agreed. agree sentiment statement, ""original"" strain getting dominated flushed variants since start. hope continues trend less severe. everyone said, way soon tell yet course.  Smallpox polio beg differ. certain oil producing countries theory since Russia Saudi joining hands reducing oil price, variant publicized (oil dropped 10% last 2 days) true. Likely still protects serious illness, probably provides coverage illness. question much. Still wayyyyy better dumb anti vaxxer f*cks Yes. That’s him. Like...? mean theory yes, think they'll actually use next weeks anything like that? think (?) OP’s point _infectious_ mild variant would cover anti-vaxxers. would great, except reasons it’s not. I’m sure countries considered reactive vs. proactive comes booster. sounds like would fall category “potential problem” opposed totally unexpected. word long symptoms lasted? Covid less politicized Israel unlike US European countries?  feel like ‘General Hospital stars’ oxymoron. Yw bud. DM want chat. I’m licensed therapist I’m trained listener I’d happy chat/shoot de shit :) facts I’m aware need keep reminding myself. Thanks reply reminder Guru(username checks out). veteran yes ppl conditions acquired service. legit statement, keyboard warrior. Hopefully behave “typically”. Don’t get condescending me. agreed masks theater areas wear based convenience.  I'm pretty sure Pfizer Moderna already running lab work behind scenes, case. don’t think that’s time works Sorry us actually like socialize experience things guess believe six months second jab. two months got J&amp;J (because basically J&amp;J really could two dose vaccine). Sounds like bunch assholes can't stand legit questions. Carry on. Either fucking way ain't working. Could becuz ppl make type questions get ignored? 

Nothing better aggressive tactics gain ppls trust. worked well far. Preprint articles require higher degree scrutiny rigor accurately evaluate many types articles. kind discussion would appropriate strictly scientific subreddit /r/COVID19.

Hi.  met Florida? mean hypochondriac type panicked anything else past 2 years, similar gravity. someone trusts science statistics history, cause believe mutation contagious less deadly eventually emerge crowd variants, changing pandemic endemic. thought infected one variant doesnt necessarily give immunity variants. Werent lot people infected alpha went infected delta? Unfortunately dont actual numbers First 4 cases Omicron vaccinated better tho?? better less severe deadly, would stop spreading killing hosts hence pandemic. less deadly spreadable still kill even people long run many many years wonderful day! Israel occupies portions WB Palestinian leaders *never* accepted proposal WB sovereign land defined borders. 

Israel doesnt control points entry Gaza. Gaza shares border Egypt Egypt controls entry point. goes back quarantine two weeks pay pcr test, quarantine hotel etc. it’s simple Source?

A NYT journalist one planes. article mentions everyone flight show negative test result boarding fully Hmm, wonder op blaming one particular band... racism!&lt; none tens millions overseas Chinese people family back China would notice? none million expats living China would say anything? none many millions Chinese people use VPNs (and even active Reddit) would say anything?

The Chinese government nowhere near power ascribing it. original outbreak Wuhan known around world within 72 hours first patient test results (at end December 2019) indicating anything amiss. head China CDC first found outbreak social media, crying loud. wrong. one arguing. unfortunately virologist epidemiologist pretend know anything I've stated. look smallpox someone considered slow mutating disease, happened nail us mutate fast enough avoid near-eradication. yes, everything exceptions.   “Young people, 20s late 30s, coming moderate severe disease, needing intensive care. 65% vaccinated rest half-vaccinated,” said Mathivha. “

everybody get vaccinated, see numbers vaccines work, unvaccinated get sick vaccinate  Preddy Kruger syndrome! IIRC postviral symptoms SARS2 highly corrolated severity illness say it’s “fear mongering,” “it hasn’t even week” sentence expect taken seriously? 

If don’t know enough it, know either way be. accuse everyone reports news “fear mongering” simultaneously admitting don’t know isn’t. 

Hilarious! I'm judging. Nobody gets everything right. I'm trying get picture overall compliance situation.  Omicron incubating immunocompromised person - I’ve seen many reports speculating untreated HIV positive patient - would vaccines helped situation? Months ago, Patient 0 likely infected, vaccines weren’t widely available places. HIV untreated, likely they’d access vaccine? get vaccine, likely vaccine would worked someone whose immune system tanked untreated HIV? 

I don’t think travel bans South Africa anything - horse left barn several international flights already. acting like western countries foregoing third doses vaccine vaccinating kids would stopped happening? unlikely. thinking viruses short transmissability window killing host. Mutations like talking occured viruses chilled slowly time killing host gave time infect multiple hosts. 


Two things remember:

1. Viruses mutate give time infect hosts. virus already long infectious window, there's pressure mutate manner. fact, many anecdotal reports healthcare workers reporting patients dying half time delta alpha beta (3-4 weeks vs 8-9 weeks.) Delta got transmissable a
**and** deadly.

2. Viruses mutate ways cannot predict. dying covers multitude horrendous, possibly long-term disabilities look nothing like colds flus. 

In short, Covid need become less deadly less harmful order become transmissable. B logic exercise. Mutations occur ways make transmissable deadly, covid already long infectious window. There's guarantee suggesting (and I'm faulting you. used trot heard lot people repeat read virologists scientists start countering points made above.) covid eventually mutate ""friendly"" levels, going happen decades likely. Omicorn incubation period may 2 weeks was, research needed however that’s bad news.

Increased incubation time longer ability spread unseen, variants Omicorn would concern. That's really viruses work. exist set shop cell pump many replicates cell dies original virus. Viruses capacity care die. it’s bad cycle  saying two don’t?

Most obviously current half pregnant situation isn’t helping anyone.

Fully agree that. Proof? post article exaggerated coverage new variant? Wonder new talking point now. TASS source could find this, comes TV interview Kluge  made articles based nothing. Prompted fear among population reason. could waited blown articles till know new development no, almost articles released main stream media made look like it’s end world.  Indeed, thoughs new bodies can’t really say 100% etc.
Thank time.   not? Spanish flu?

Also 229E literally coronavirus causes cold.

The next covid coming. Hopefully learn one. Palestine it’s country, Israel occupying West Bank controlling points entry Gaza violation signed peace treaties ? 

Can’t ways. Either Palestine sovereign nation Israeli occupying power want try argue ""we know vaccines work"" thing ""we know vaccines work, know well,"" go it.

But people think two statements same, statement precise enough meaningful. Thanks information.  Yes, fact many people find symptoms appear subsiding think made find days later come back vengeance. Ugh, it’s time year again

Something big covid related happening I’m refreshing Twitter, Reddit BBC news app constantly expecting answers show mean play safe getting vaccinated wearing masks? Yes many chances mutate easily lead 'errors', mutations random 'best' transmissible dominate always mean deadly etc. could easily contagious cold flu due errors mutating become contagious.  vaccines general nearly effective Covid vaccines

Could possible correct, might comparable sooner think.

My (laypersons) understanding flu vaccine effective manufacturers variant surveillance Summer opposite (North/South) hemisphere. try guess variants become dominant hemisphere winter.

When couple traditional vaccine manufacturing techniques means make call early think dominant variants, vaccine year hemisphere therefore targets strains looking like spreading Summertime opposite hemisphere. They'll get strains right miss strains, hence lower overall efficacy.

However, (all?) covid vaccines made vaccine platforms claim faster turnaround getting clinical trials. get manufacture-ready quicker, surveil flu variants longer able accurately guess dominant strains past. Hence, theory, efficacy flu vaccines. barking. thing every one servicemembers common vaccinated. know underlying conditions. know old were, lived, kind lifestyle led. know every one individuals unvaccinated.

That point. unvaccinated point become pre-existing condition. Maybe scientific context, definitely reason day dying now. Anecdotal reassuring. I’ll take it. wait Fauci saying quite one main objectives How? thing I've seen media reporting facts stand. new variant concern, troubling mutations could evade vaccine immunity. mean that's There's nothing else. Lol.   Mandatory vaccinations, distribute medical grade n95 masks everyone actually enforce mask mandate, actually enforce track trace apps public venues, close high transmission non-essential venues like pubs clubs, provide government assistance impacted businesses employees.

The UK short money resources fight this, Torys dont want anything threaten mates money piss anti-vacc voters. got case rate down, literally island effectively control borders strict testing quarantine. Hell, literally right edge forcing case rate keeping low, we've bouncing around R0 1 70% vaccinated, 85-90% would minimal spread Delta. Omicron math yet seen... yes did. alleged lit fire bed room sharing two children Sunday morning.

Hopefully new parents get kids vaccinated. Good Lord, please save us obsession fear porn. Maybe worse side effect pandemic. looking international response lends credence theory nobody expecting this. looks like immunocompromised person Botswana allowed long infection variant born. What’s unfortunate spread. I’m positive there’s similar circumstances new variant simply died host. 

Omicron got out. It’s new development thus far new negative consequence Covid. agree point, dying crash sure beats dying gasping breath five days so... quite. Doctors scientists already saying T/B cells obtained original vaccine could still effective variants, means protection serious illness. delta variant still circulating vaccines shown effective against.  Let's wait weeks see happens.  Sure think selection work.

If deadly contagious variant arrive lock death count cannot ignored, manage stop death pile up.

That selection work, done dice rolled decide new mutation be.  also got sudden Tinnitus mild hearing loss year. apparent reason. It’s also amazing many people zero doses. Live SE Michigan mask mandate removed you’re vaccinated, almost one mask on, even though vaccinations 50-55% range. Yes covid doomsday scenario end world, exactly thinking. Let's lock everything hide corner houses yelling filthy unpure subjugating us despair. really ""standard"" expectation/knowledge study viruses.

What timescales applies, cavaets? Smallpox around thousands years still highly lethal eradicated it. Tuberculosis also around thousands years still highly lethal treated antibiotics. outliers, reasons exceptions? defines pandemic.

I'm work visa visa appointments hard get. slowly getting choose job go home know point I'll choose latter. Hope one things keeps people going. would say everyone needs good dose hope days. hear you. always get flu shot well. However, remember correctly, around 50-60% people states typically get flu shot. need much higher percentage people vaccinated covid make difference. Unfortunately don’t see happening. number mutations omicron concerning. read delta 8 mutations away original. Omicron 32. 

I don’t think anyone expected many mutations quickly. I’m also biologist I’m sure information. Hoping real biologists explain next couple weeks. less likely become severely sick mean catching covid problem.

Ridiculous. everyone well 5’s do, Covid wouldn’t considered pandemic. consult science fiction authors come new strain name? Yes South Africa, cases people 20-30's total confirmed cases studied 2828, limited population many answers people 20-40 less likely vaccinated among population.
 key factor vaccination. new variant appears spreading quickly among unvaccinated. Currently, 40% adult South Africans vaccinated, number much lower among 20 40-year-old age group.

Look, cautious important, it’s obviously serious disease. laypeople often don’t seem understand extent *all* infectious diseases wreak havoc body, even ones typically mild. isn’t remotely unique COVID-19; you’re learning now.

There’s need swing far direction imply things listed remotely common (and throw paper think proves point, I’m willing say near certainty either understand study it’s limitations). safe, careful, get vaccinated, wear mask, fearmongering — even implication — isn’t doing. beginning unbearable, time died little longer constant, still unpleasant times. went get checked doctor determined there's nothing wrong ear hearing totally fine.

Per report - infected Omicron South Africa (so far) mild Nov 28 (Reuters) - South African doctor one first suspect different coronavirus strain among patients said Sunday symptoms Omicron variant far mild could treated home. 
Dr. Angelique Coetzee, private practitioner chair South African Medical Association, told Reuters Nov. 18 noticed seven patients clinic symptoms different dominant Delta variant, albeit ""very mild"". 
Now designated Omicron World Health Organization, variant detected announced South Africa's National Institute Communicable Diseases (NICD) Nov. 25 samples taken laboratory Nov. 14 Nov. 16. 
Coetzee said patient Nov. 18 reported clinic ""extremely fatigued"" two days body aches headache. 
""Symptoms stage much related normal viral infection. seen COVID-19 past eight 10 weeks, decided test,"" said, adding patient family turned positive. 
On day, patients came similar symptoms, realised ""something else going on."" Since then, seen two three patients day. 
""We seen lot Delta patients third wave. fit clinical picture,"" said, adding alerted NICD day clinical results. 
""Most seeing very, mild symptoms none far admitted patients surgeries. able treat patients conservatively home,"" said.

While next weeks give us better indication dealing global scale - certainly possible highly transmissible deadly could too. 

Still - people die Omicron - many preventable deaths too. 

So - meant discourage anyone vaccinated vaccination remains best way currently available mitigate mutations, prevent spread degree, ultimately (and hopefully) make pandemic endemic. Vflex 9105 used even pandemic lead paint dust. Fits really tight around face. Laughs American

No sequencing, omicron Certainly that's true, seems though discovered samples taken 3 weeks ago. So, large universe patients draw data from, 3 weeks data, 5 days. helpful, thanks! think scale production it'll definitely lot potential developing countries. also exploring hybrid flu/covid shot could useful future.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* reason spike targeted it’s critical ability virus enter cell replicate. can’t enter, can’t replicate cause damage. mutations cause spike change much structurally, can’t function function well, likely means existing antibodies still ability neutralize, variants date. It’s also antibodies— T-cells ones seek destroy. ability recognize pathogens, slightly different enough evade them. Also recent research indicated body generates slightly differing versions antibodies well, “just case”, sort of, kind like painting 100 people, they’ll roughly subject different. recognize different versions “car”. 

So see vaccine induced immunity Omicron suspect able evade enough negate existing vaccines support idea it’s pointless get existing vaccines. big media farcical, seen variants OMG. gay. mean might turn straight?? Perfect, let’s get back life now. No, going stuck pandemic forever... rationale people going move life becomes endemic.

If Omicron truly transmissible early signals suggest, capable evading existing antibodies degree, vaccine uptake would virtually 100%. happening, move on, get vaccinated heart's content, stop catastrophizing.

Then, new variant, repeat :/   one welcome new omicronion overlord significant restaurant?  doubt people prior infections fare worse vaccinated. body gets better profile entire virus infection susceptible spike protein changes. Since omicron discovered five days ago we've got limited numbers samples, doubt safely assume anything clinical outcomes. quote actually Fauci?  mean first dose, got booster kids. 

I dont understand. first dose talking waiting booster would qualify 7 months? 

If it’s first dose, that’s got Covid. takes like 45 days first dose fully vaccinated. rather definitive info news Yes shold get booster, provide protection omicron also currently predominant delta. responded punishment volition

And responded pointing comparison apples oranges out. 

What bodily harm inflicted coercing someone pay taxes? 

An injection, hand, Körperverletzung.  Resistant vaccines mean scary lol. flu mutates enough us take vaccine every season, mean scary too?

From I'm reading cases infected, symptoms variant mild even compared first strain covid 3 shots. take trip nuts, imo. Part problem vaccines work nearly well already transplant shit ton immunosuppressive meds prevent organ rejection. found 30% kidney transplant recipients still detectable antibodies 3rd dose vaccine. best time get vaccinated definitely transplant surgery. It’ll least 5-6 months see booster’s initial release. Delta probably still primary variant are. booster help variant even it’s tailored it. Get boosted.  Nope, conservatives use feelings faith based practice. Hence historical practice country wives tails remedies etc think can't say science PR reasons. know, prove first. I’m getting vaxxed you’re happy Jess bezos’s new bitcoin miner. 

I, least decent immune system. prob. wonder guys got sick, Delta vaccines ~90% efficacy 2 weeks second shot - vaccinated single shot 2 weeks ago.

Why get 9 months ago experts said so? covid first started article mutations author talked strain would spread fast deadly taking best case scenario. Basically covid turns commonly cold coronavirus. know early really hope thats direction new variant took. They're not? Surely source that. bet, slight vaccine efficacy reduction. still effective, boosters become necessary across board.

Unvaccinated prior infections high risk. spreads fast it’s looking, burn group spring, fun massive surge brings table.

Hope wrong infectious pretty mild instead…. haven’t lucky far.

Should know soon. 95% ""experts"". Well almost year data billions doses administered, approved fda, fucking Trump said get booed mention Fox News vaccinated, hospitalization data majority good research coming outside United States … yeah, it’s bullshit excuses. .....if symptoms getting less violent need force populace shit.

They force flu shots.  Australia impression full time job. live business owner whose daughter involved assaying. Even known cases town, said able find viral fragments.

Supply outstripped demand. There's huge amount vaccine skepticism SA, point age groups offered vaccines earlier scheduled due low turnout. 

Vaccines super available SA. lot people want them, unfortunately. Ok saying Republicans dying needlessly ""part problem"" Republicans *actually* needlessly dying not. get right? forget take horse medicine today. COVID last December I’m fully vaccinated 2 Pfizer got Moderna booster shot. never knew spike protein changes that’s really interesting. massive wave peaked decline like southeast US. RIP Natural immunity enough. Obviously. remember virus deadly? it. Was. Novel. Meaning bodies never seen before. haven’t seen single person already covid end hospital. however seen hundreds people vaccinated hospital.  That’s I’m saying!!! clinical trials, might earlier that. Meh IMO better first get testing done publish kinds stories yet people media spin twist 200 ways sunday - next thing know unvaccinated Joe Shmoe suddenly reading headline says something like 'Vaccines need updated Omicron' spreads. Based sample young otherwise healthy patients. Also it’s still early days infection don’t know variant progress. It’s good hear they’re well doesn’t really tell us much unfortunately. didn’t read article take it.

Even correct, think maximum use hospital resources caused easily avoidable serious illness benefits anyone? Short long term? Blissfully ignorant? first hand, intimately know Covid done people, day day out. job. fools making scare monger headlines doomsday predictions fuels skepticism anti-vax Q-anon sentiment general public scary headlines get contradicted turn wrong. logical nuanced reason outright banning travel countries happened discover variant ethically, economically logically incorrect approach. Please continue make useless comments, don’t much interest dialogue. Continuing say “ya good job” quite childish way go things. definitely helps make feel better it! Thank you!! Ty this, wondered Peru's crazy numbers while. hope right, don’t think case. said, data show reality near future.

From data seen, natural immunity hasn’t shown nearly good vaccination. Boosters make spread much further. also doesn’t last long. So, new variant comes along looks substantially different, people infer group risk. like delta.

Do good source saying otherwise? true virus never go extinct time wants mutate Keep polarising buddy That's changed counting criteria better reflect actual toll, including people died showing obvious covid symptoms never tested, unlike many countries. Excess deaths data points countries worse death rate Peru, Russia Bulgaria, 6,000 deaths per million inhabitants. fact upvotes blows says omicron variant might 'evade immune protection': COVID-19 updates hurry die.   yes unvaccinated passengers, situation made lot people calling pcr tests everyone flies country see anti- vaxxers clogged hospitals. work omicron ability transmit rapidly, bypassing immunity vaccines monoclonal antibody therapy? people laid stretchers, ambulances outside hospitals delta struck India. know I'm asking ""what if"" questions definitive answers right now. still wait see affects brain long term. unlikely successful.

Say two strains equally infectious. One deadly other.

 one result harsher lockdown measures? US then. Let's go ~~to Winchester~~ get vaccinated, nice cold pint, wait blow over. people politicized. However, ones conducting studies, public health officials doctors seem give fucks care public health only. makes sense me, Israel's end goal public policies long term health/benefit/survival people even odds others.

They also public health system research studies, things like 2 million person study involving people get vaccinated. Agreed outside international travel. I’ll never able see family rate. well. New stadium hey ! let’s fill up. Ridiculous. Well Moderna thinks early 2022.    Thanks post, I've looking discussion plans up-rev current vaccines. 

Thanks like delta, oh wait Glad got now.  Sure do. Can’t fault way shape form. Whitmer protecting state she’s certainly seems upset playtriots. I'm great it, useful skill able worry things can't change. One way help take advice. Yup. Christmas know lot variant. Better cautious flippant. Unless??? Got 2 shots last week. Got time kids could get it. Shoot up, baby! ""I believe therefore can't true"" exactly play Plague Inc.  booster make easier B cells undertake affinity maturation respond slightly different spike proteins (read: variants), helpful either way. Get booster!  got 2 doses last week. say ""yes"" it'll due punishments place saying ""no"" therefore longer wirksame Zustimmung thus Körperverletzung.

Aren't already mandatory vaccinations place? different matter entirely individuals state disregard Grundgesetz.

Explain victim. suggesting individuals round vaccinate force? fucking airlines strict would helped. fuel antivaxxers suggesting vaccine longer work contrary seems like probably (at least partially, booster).  That’s good point. We’ll wait see comes different countries next couple weeks. absurd. Someone shut up. data proves otherwise keep mouth shut. need god damn toilet paper. 
Well, maybe de-ages 30 years... many possibilities know almost nothing new variant!  Pfizer Moderna say respond three months so, include approval?

For Biontech said 100 days detection new variant first batches updated vaccine.  Every day think surprised anymore something like happens.

I wonder people getting vaccine thats unregulated tested 100 people ones still claiming know effects vaccines collectively ""tested"" 7 billion people worldwide far? 

I understand world anymore I'm afraid.  imagine pathetic took time write this. lmao worthless fuck  Wwz looking realistic minute. book least.   considered classic covid symptoms aside loss smell? many population decided listen anti-vaxx vitriol shared freely social media westerners. president practically begging people vaccinate.

That garbage everywhere getting even worse militant. Delta still dominant know current vaccines effective it, get booster can. doctor, advice I've heard immunologists medical professionals online. Wow, fully vaccinated going save officials Sunday confirmed two **fully vaccinated**, asymptomatic passengers flight Sydney tested positive new coronavirus variant government isolation. Agreed :/ See comment, I'll reiterate going post history clearly CCP-belieber sorts:

local government officials hospital administrators punished covid outbreaks region hospitals.

This incentivises extremely harsh lockdowns underreporting cases, even incentivises censorship. report many covid cases, wind outbreak area, CCP either put nice little list pay visit.

Sure, probably manageable amount cases China. 1,3 billion people 'a hundred day' - bollocks.

Don't even get started censorship Chinese social media individual users. You’re scared signaling behind communication. 

things get worse, bad. stop burying head sand Self-reported medical surveys helped identify value cannabinoids potential treatment option epilepsy.

You know talking sad admit it.  isn’t much alternative…  BRB, let get crystal ball Looks like scientific community disagrees  Well highly mutated version COVID evade vaccine infection induced antibodies circulating anywhere relatively high numbers (as Omicron seems Guateng, SA) governments countries would completely irresponsible keep allowing flights nation. Period. End discussion.

Hurt feelings soothed later. Lives line. mainly true, think two points update seem significance already: 

1. Omicron seems reinfect people easily previous variants.

2. Already practiced emergency treatments like steroids IL6 receptor blockers still effective. Reinfection occur virus, it’s whether you’ll sick first encounter that’s issue.  Hm get impression reinfection main concern. True. Im worried bit extreme exhaustion. means even hypothesis, normal cold.   also high fever two days. considering admitting seemed get better couple days. Israeli government blocked Covid vaccines entering Palestine. best light political, worse light far worse thanks input! personally symptoms cough.

As testing, states, no. free way get tested calling state department ambulance service, they're backed takes 3 days come. They're also unreliable it, tests super half-assed cross-contaminating samples, leading false positives.. kind shit show Yes, exactly comment replying said. one shot flu vaccine first Covid vaccine? Interesting...not sure genetic engineering level yet tho...  That’s got it. new data Honestly, masks seriously limited severity Delta surge state allowed us essentially avoid new reatrictions without fully buckling healthcare system. especially obvious cities vaccination rates pretty good masking mandated transmission rate stayed comparatively low. Antigen Test tend show someone contagious. 

PCR shows genetic material present. 

You test positive PCR plaque-forming-units (viral particles ability infect). 

In fact test positive PCR long contagious. Don’t see true warning signaling bad news come. Like seriously blind be. One thing caught attention possibility reinfection COVID previously. Seems case due mutations observed.  don't. tell nothing except people's feelings. know. suspect decide move forward, kind abbreviated trials check safety efficacy. idea process work. Maybe purposely release strain capabilities could speed process take control things. Seems trend, soon scientific community well aware variant, already late. Cries Australian living overseas Exactly. let's stick official numbers speculation. Respond exactly? keep seeing “buying time” argument I’m sure understand people proposing done. vaccines still would much longer lasting antibody neutralization pre-Delta strains. effectiveness reduced Delta multiple antibody escape mutations (as one could expect viral evolution still relatively-new-to-humans virus). existing vaccine effective intended be, else would going back boosters 6 months. original projection/hope they'd good year minimum. likely would true viral evolution stopped Alpha (the vaccines completely crushed Alpha surge US too). I’m gonna track marks doses  get booster shot catching it? Got use something. Might well stick official numbers.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Exactly.  virus Sars-Cov-2, disease virus causes COVID-19. time Sars-Cov-2 mutates enough classified new variant concern given Greek designation make easier talk variant. Omicron next Greek letter used. work? Rapid Antigen Test part rely Nucleocapsid protein, Spike protein. 

While spike protein shown readily mutate, nucleocapsid protein not. taken alarmist bad, not. exactly Swine Flu did, *why* swine flu turned catastrophe.

A probable scenario Omicron completely evades existing antibodies. speculated researchers day first genomic sequencing done, since nearly every binding point current neutralizing antibodies changed. Without effective antibodies, exposure allows infection quickly spread; low incubation period become contagious. could easily lead complete loss sterilizing immunity among vaccinated previously infected people. press released actual antibody neutralization makes likelihood, since would (incorrectly) cause panic.

But mean loss protective immunity. B cells figure new virus multiply numbers within days. happens fast enough - get even tiny booster dose new spike protein train B cells - contagiousness could avoided (and severity, even already low, could reduced another measurable factor). B cells - is, making sure least two vaccine doses separated 6+ months, single vaccine dose months infection - would also help greatly. long ""helper T"" CD4 cells recognize new antigen, cellular immunity still work - time prevent infection/contagiousness.

Omicron growing 5-fold Johannesburg relative Delta. first day people taken simple number tried extrapolate it. cannot tell difference increased contagiousness versus immune escape single number. assume 7-day serial interval immune escape, find 5 times contagious Delta. Obviously immune escape (we tell genome), instead complete immune escape Johannesburg 85% population immunity, instead get 2x less contagious Delta. latter actually makes complete sense - that's par original Covid, rate spreading (5x per week, 25% per day) nearly identical D614G's rate spread back winter/spring 2020.

Loss sterilizing immunity brings short-term problems. means high probability infection regardless vaccination status, likely high rate spread across world. go back swing flu example - exactly saw too. also means less contagious disease that's easier deal long run, likely crushed updated vaccines wildtype Alpha were. pattern holds reduced contagiousness also means reduced severity, means Omicron could less severe even among unvaccinated. Ding ding ding!   biological makeup Omicron hallmarks strain current vaccines struggle with. yes right responsible thing raise alarm put place reasonable precautions err side ot caution. alternative letting rip reacting conclusive data could unimaginably bad consequences.

I'm defending article written btw. reports heard compliance masks planes high. Obviously depends airline, take safety seriously enforce Viruses mutate. notation format mutations (B.1.1.529) notable variants get human-readable name like delta omicron virus. Viruses mutate. mutation gets name easier talk them. Go cry 😹😹😹😹😹 Moderna?  early, yes. said, South Africa also said cases rather mild least hope might good news go along bad news. We’re struggle US city, it’s still pain ass. People quitting frankly it’s job prop commercial real estate rather spending time families maintaining health Covid waves, plenty businesses willing adapt. might especially salty though commercial developers essentially hollowed city’s downtown sitting empty offices years rather selling allowing turned housing, would turn help small businesses area way more. News flash . Stop afraid government’s way scaring lock next 3 years. Wake tf mutating, viruses tend do. particular virus causes much trouble assorted mutations get Greek Alphabet names plastered news, anything unusual viruses do.   surprising, sooner later everyone come contact virus, case vaccinated comparatively high risk severe infection. Since covid stay least several generations matter time. see endemic coronaviruses constant reinfections. vaccines protect severe infection, case. Im glad mild symtpoms. One theories happened Spanish Flu. mutated less deadly form. post like walking well air freshened bathroom someone took giant shit. indeed quite likely it'll take far 3 months distribution. none anything Delta specific booster. tested boosters past found existing vaccine still efficacious, hence warrant complete change 6 mos antibody neutralization completely gone bad

Who defines good bad? You? Antibodies wane, that's is. would likely wane vaccine tailored variant. People already come terms this? Seems like things mostly back normal US, gotta continue mask sanitize regularly Anyone actually seeing true warning come. 

That awful variant really bad timenn ELI5 disease keeps changing much requires new name? Yup say Israel always strategic tries best always self reliant.


Like said unique history position geopolitical sphere surrounded enemies etc. read article? says almost exactly said needs clearly state. exact article. imposing travel bans isn’t downplaying severity lmfao. Anybody brain smell bullshit behind “new variant” . It’s coming abundantly clear mass vaccination what’s causing fret US impose require quarantine affected areas. help enhance curve. west making situation worse actively punishing countries identifying new strains. South Africa share results future they’ll immediately banned? Travel bans stupid, ineffective borderline dangerous. 

There’s containing it. You’re fool don’t believe Omnicron already isn’t US. still level one lockdown. Mask mandates everywhere public since last March. Still curfew night, never got lifted. weare mask. shops still mandate sanitizer enter. 40% got least one vaccine. moved summer.

Go look beautiful three waves. Perfectly controlled elevating lockdown levels. always expected fourth wave early December. right time. Highly doubt it, vaccination curve almost pleateauing SA lately Gauteng 25% country's population. Yea, immunosuppresion regimen help prevent rejection makes sooo difficult us navigate covid infested waters. upon time able rely form herd immunity, well protective measures. Shame disinformation ruined protective measures reaction government population would different. one infection, deadly variant spreading.

Imagine six ten weeks deadly variant come country. government consider lockdown/ mandatory vaccinations fashion infectious mostly harmless variant?

The virus care, success virus depends behaviour people. different deadly virus. media running LOT coverage know weeks know anything. worst kind fear mongering. facts dont know yet, writing articles number mutations doomsday scenarios indefensible. sober way discuss potential threat way it... double bad position win argument. Self-reported medical surveys value. trust nation I’m getting downvoted calling clear informative media response? Pretty sus Thanks man. Im vaxxed synpatons appear mild cold. Honestly blindsided positive test result. We’ll overreact anyway We’re trusting Israeli state? I’m layman, I’m wrong person ask, understanding common cold coronavirus. that’s seems like it’s destiny could (way road) like common cold. Thanks! Looking right now.  Megatron variant coming? made comparisons except EXTROVERTS. thanks offer, would LOVE go outside except we've got 3 shiny atmospheric rivers headed way next 3 days already storming out. hope things looking better part world.  HAHAHAHAHA!!! Take upvote get outta here. *She said, total, two dozen patients tested positive Covid-19 with symptoms new variant. They mostly healthy men turned “feeling tired”. half unvaccinated.* Yep. It’s good though. won’t completely shut border US Canada.

They last time, able travel couple months extended family exemption Canada offering. People sympathy think anyone anything remotely risky anti-vax. 

Yes, I’m going something risky love life. bad? Moderna shots **and** booster. Oh no! vaccine cause fight symptoms? Bummer. Wow telling us without data proof... ""well mild cases"" country exceptionally young due ravaged HIV.

Wait data comes actual scientists. Delta vs. Alpha shows severity need decrease transmissibility, I've long suspected/hoped maximum value severity function transmissibility attained Delta. im concerned people want lock everything soon media posts scary covid headline dont socialize anyway.

We barely data variant speculation media hysteria point.... likelyhood vaccines still effective given would outcompete delta all. point game, it’s pretty much either tell PCP hospitalized/out-patient visits. fucking cares? likely youth really low vaccination rate SA I'm post-doc, wish more! Oh well, least enjoy science. incredible time alive sequence viral genome identify mutated, test mutant strain antibodies derived previous vaccines, develop altered vaccine account new mutations within less week.

I chatting class mate mine earlier week going can't trust pharmaceutical companies there's much money line them. ridiculous premise two reasons. one, else besides pharmaceutical company develop, test, manufacture vaccine less year? Michelin star chefs? Green Peace? Astrophysicists? No. Secondly, yes, large amounts money needed manufacture drugs quickly. Maybe people save millions lives horrible disease *should* get live privileged lives. People who've done far less humanity get rewarded fortunes time. anyone know date enforceable? Still gov website big part virus long takes times strike even exposure/infection. began hear variant yesterday.

I'm hoping best case scenario COVID evolving less dangerous form itself. Thanks hope get paid good would think reason mutate vaxxed people much less likely get infected first place. 

Not immune-compromised vs. non-vaccinated. far non-vaccinated people getting infected immune-compromised simply large disparity two populations. Back trump came power ToI published H1B visas banned; turns proposed bill. trust source supported sources.  Fear way live life. mortality rate covid minimal. Georgia never really shutdown, life normal along. get vaccine want, it’s choice. Go outside, go camping, boyfriend burned out, find something different do. live once, can’t control uncontrollable. Wish best luck. close Ay.4.2.0, shame. appropriate wait see going general consensus. Thus virus proven tricky figure times. I'm going hope best case scenario COVID evolved less dangerous form itself. Thank do! May humans dominant species future. learn anything, keep making mistakes regress antithetical evolution. there’s none left  die jab. said thing. South Africa found first...it could originated anywhere about. would hurt get booster case? long term effect vaccine, already exposed it. Thank could put people quarantine, apparently countries pull off.  Delta also *not* necessarily way worse, way transmissible, mostly dangerous kids many unable get vaccinated recently. Covid going away. Vaccines meant prevent it, meant make less severe. hope is, eventually get mutation transmissible less deadly, circa Spanish flu. Please spread panic misinformation. personally think US, live, lockdown again. I'll set theoretical scenario does. 

Schools lockdown, hinders development schoolchildren. Many jobs close again, never returning. Massive layoffs occur, unemployment skyrockets, inflation gets control, economy heavily damaged. Crime rates across country skyrocket (poor education + high unemployment correlates rising crime), causing mass chaos damage throughout country. ironic thing is, healthcare hospitals, theory lockdown supposed relieve, would also suffer massively scenario. isn’t first person say this. I’m guessing presumed experts would willing say, “this actually seems milder” wouldn’t take long determine it’s killing people left right. Don’t live life fear go see loved ones Genuinely curious - immune-evasive there's enough spike protein mutations, much Delta infection Omicron infection preventative other? dominance occur they're different enough? saying army I've training body last 7 months still lose battle? Yea thing transmissible suspect theres nothing stop spreading everywhere. Thank service. Really. severe symptoms reported among initial crop Omicron patients, CNN, NYT like would shouting rooftops. Smells like covid repeat next variant, next one, one that.

Zoom Christmas BABY!!!! work well. immnocomprised person means still fight better may mean difference life death hopefully prevent events.

Moreover remember hypothetically, know true origins Omicron HIV patient true assuming someone treated. Retrovirals make basically back normal immune system.

Immnocompromised getting vaccines boosters everyone collective interests included. Gauteng's hospital admissions gone last two weeks. symptoms definitely interesting. wonder hospitalized patients also different symptoms.   goal keep out, they've already failed among first nations confirmed infections. I’m curious nature disease changed many mutations. Milder? severe? New symptoms? It’s interesting seeing countries take strong preventive measures, seems like could play either way. I’m arguing here. Im even guy originally replied original comment. Im saying, second commentator asked show article claim bad “March 2020”, original commenter shifted goalposts. 

I don’t really care this. /u/elitenathanpeterman said, article claims back March 2020. 

If anything, annoying part Internet arguments people claiming one thing, bunch commentators come underneath say “well AcTuAlLy that’s meant. didn’t mean literally”. said said. It’s wrong. That’s it.

And no, didn’t say example. said news taking opportunity blast we’re back March 2020 can. again, true. Yes, still incredibly unlikely render vaccines ineffective. good sub covid information. Go r/COVID-19. incredibly well moderated, pinned discussions ones look for. get epidemiology science people epidemiologists.  Well fuck. want “cheers, let reap sow” also child can’t vaccinated yet. Fucking fuck. That’s bad news Maybe it’s they’re focusing certain travellers, sure looks like it’s everywhere Africa Netherland’s 61 cases, didn’t say omnicron, passengers tested positive Covid clear haven’t determined many omnicron. Could strain. fantastic! Let's hope really end it! case ideal. means virus, endemic us now, mellow eventually become another common cold. pretty unsurprising virus' best interest weaken spread faster like cold, rather burn neighborhoods ala ebola. Also they're size refrigerator (average American body type) That's thing though, owe anyone ""everything power"" longer goes longer ""line"" stretch.

Realistically vaccines always true end goal society. sucks get make last longer, done part one entitled sacrifice longer, already done realistically feasible sacrificed could so. cannot purposefully bring hardship wanting make everyone content problem, anti vaxxers are.
Do let person make double think life done Realistically do, owe anything more, one life making harder children already making difference. 

What make difference enough anti vaxxers either died forced get jab risk losing job. won’t it’s transmissible milder symptoms that’s great news. It’d become dominating variant reduce deaths Delta variant. chomping bit emerged America 1930s according Oxford English Dictionary chomp overtaken champ common use.

If something around almost 100 years commonly used... Gonna deal one. 

Better brush Latin, gotta get back close root language language sprang name ""correct"". yet see. varient massively infectious could equivalent giving everybody severe cold/mild flu weeks. clue would actually impact society.

It appear lethal least. Genuinely asking, biologically similar common cold, every going eradicate this, even vaccines? saying originated South Africa.  Circumstantial stuff (and early days too) but..

Edit : link got removed Reddit, searchj Google ""Newsweek 500% Omicron"" first result

When wrote article claiming could 500% transmissible show tweet someone writing ""oh god!!!"" 100 case point Bull ...
Also saying worse Variant ever seen far ...

Not everybody read king articles able understand ""maybe"" article, clearly written way scarry ... read potentially 500% transmissible, people remember sure transmissible, maybe, 200% maybe 500% also less transmisible cause data yet .. 

You could easily super spreader happens initials strain COVID19 suddenly big increase quickly, many possibilities ... 'ow even transmissible, guarantee remove delta one already lot circulating (what really case South Africa right now, easier Omicron spread)

 current vaccines worked variants thus far, better others. drug companies able see vaccines respond variants, able educated guesses future variants get around current vaccines. Earth possible 10% infected two planes? 
They negative pcr surely yet two planes higher infection rate devastated countries peak 
10%??? that's general positivity rate SA thats 6 million currently infected. Something quite add  Almost 1 million people US alone died COVID, many people US suffer autoimmune diseases etc put increased risk illness death.

I'm sympathetic people tired anxiety fatigue stems lockdowns constant stream bad news, inability express evidently experience compassion lives lost, real potential, admirable praiseworthy. better anybody care people country community.  wasn’t talking headline. pointing media run fearful unknowns caused panic facts aren’t clear yet. set seem creating market around anxiety fear that’s large driving factor lot peoples perception times. Good news doesn’t sell well. kind implying well. used crisis ensure open years isolate further. surprised takes decade even free travel China (similar Soviet republic) Oh lord, listening local health authorities. crazy! guy YouTube? Huh?!?!1

/s deepest sympathies support public health workers entire mess ... Well first all, vaccines create natural immunity. quite literally work. Second, get sick get antibodies. bit like saying ""we'll get stronger glass windshield collide unbuckled go it."" people (generally 40) survive that. 

But way many heavy goatee 50s saying this. assholes (and are) bringing hospital capacity. Hope need acute emergency care, that's reserved covidiots. Like water sieve True Israel notoriously overreactive things.

If say mild, likely even mild that. According experts Israel natural immunity 6 13 times effective vaccine.  Like water sieve Like water sieve making educated guess. enough data conclude anything solid.    it’s known contagious virulent is, preemptively closing borders introducing mechanisms contain worst-case situation prudent, especially since won’t long it’s known whether controls relaxed.  doctors quoted sounded optimistic got fingers crossed initial findings stick.  Exactly, know fully well keep out. travel across borders all, ever, would keep anything fully out. see effect extent seeding (# index cases) Delta - India bad April, UK extensive per capita travel India vs US peaked July it, US peak late August. 4 months US bought let people get vaccinated, whereas UK rushing get people second doses since gotten yet. know what. Thank taking time read posts give helpfully replies

I first sickest house, first get tested, requirement job symptoms. mil blaming I'm one positive test, despite everyone else showing symptoms idea Spanish flu originated Kansas absolutely consensus. Also, idea USA willingly blamed another country ludicrous, one time really knew originated (we still don't) Like water sieve Like water sieve *Very intense chin scratching emoji* Real cool Dr Sigh...the medias response completely disproportionate know. constantly building burning credibility shit. say antivax friends news reporting covid sober rational...this doesnt help. Good them. that's gotta year's rent Came say this. ""Mild"" medical setting refers mostly patient needing supplemental oxygen. wide spectrum feeling like shit fine requiring oxygen. 

What mild, severe critical? think “mild” like minor cold.

No. “Mild” positive test, fever, cough — maybe even pneumonia, needing oxygen. “Severe” breathing rate oxygen saturation down, needing oxygen ventilator. “Critical” respiratory failure multi-organ (in New Hampshire) got look bewilderment man 50s seeing walk grocery store mask yesterday. I'm triple vaxxed something tells nothing change peoples minds minor things prevent infection, let alone get vaccine. americans holding concerts now. artists BTS holding concerts right now... way live life. mortality rate covid minimal. 

This 1000%. Remember this. OK live That… doesn’t sound rational. made that. that’s case, man clearly unable make good decisions nursing home. case, doctor friend hav picked that. realize scientists learning virus along rest us, right? damn crystal ball, make recommendations data have. Imagine it’s mild vaccines unnecessary, rip Pfizer Moderna Dammit! Came say this, Cake Day! Thanksgiving's over. two days ago. mean Christmas? Dutch paper wrongly translated. 61 omicron.
 
'On plane SA, 61 passengers tested positive among probably omicron'. Except evolution doesn’t work already kids Yeah... yeah  new variant exact opposite endemic. can’t declare something endemic.

I’m tired grandpa    I'm sure ever say that, source? one person? seemed like everyone knew worse India started happening. He’s acting like doctor offended religious views.

Then went home self harm throw fit defiance almost died. 

Incredible made religion made up, disjointed, contradicting views.  mean many pandemics drawing from? flu strain better known causer 1918 flu pandemic still around gung ho back then. take chances surviving vaccines.

That's kind issue, though. 

All experts I've heard said wearing masks protecting yourself, around you. 

And even care well being, stop sick (potentially infected asymptomatic selves) get back normal. 

However look it, leads simple conclusion wear masks. everywhere, maybe, absolutely high risk areas. based anecdotal observation one doctor 20ish patients, mostly young healthy testing positive. hardly even worth reporting, still know next nothing new variant. Eram...we evidence even *that* technical. Im also dealing anxiety definitely relate.
It easy always go worst possible outcome.

Im Sweden. majority people worn mask point pandemic. around 400.000 confirmed covidcases age 0-30 26 deaths age demographic. understanding, almost everyone several underlying conditions. 

With age, already gone Covid also beeing tripple vaccinated anxiety probably lot likely impact health covid. 

Anxiety makes hard think rationally, try.

Stay safe! overall hospitalisations SA stayed remarkably consistent small rise recently, per site. 514-570-628.  loosing battle means dying, unlikely well trained army, probably even Omicron! next week, basically everywhere? real holidays since War Christmas.  replicate.

Its typically thought milder kikl hosts, happens ecological timelines. Eg look Ebola New England get lot international travel winter? thought ""fuck weather, let's go south"" time year lot them. speed Pfizer claimed produce flexible vaccine makes think got early data variant - Nov. 16th first sequenced - health community spooked. information readily prepared priority thanksgiving week makes concerned already know cat bag. same. Seems maybe rapid tests (already sensitive covid) may quite sufficient Omicron Well played TOI ruling party bias, pandered Congress UPA1. doubt much. Yeah damn know Russel Davies working hard new stuff “Doctor Found Omicron” plot third doctor episode 70s Yes cases gone ~200 ~3000 time frame. Hospitalizations lag cases course far cases rising quite disproportionately, would expect see business usual.  said thing delta beginning. found worse. Misinformation especially rampant first days. hahahahahaha!!! brought back memories!! Yeah that's said. dude god's supposed do. Stupid God. week, shocked affecting stock market soon. never pay back loans.. Let's jinx it, i'll stop going gym couple weeks, big deal.

I'm prepred waves misinformation bullshit i'm going receive familly group whatsapp haha Two cases know of. Probably quite cases community since two recent travel. first two shots Pfizer booster moderna. girlfriend Pfizer first two well. ""We're gonna die""- Chief . Predator higher sequenced cases. 

You view COVID cases here: Makes sense show self-driving vehicles do. downvotes comment illustration humans' denial. Iran government totalitarian, mistreat people, rules 4-6 states using alternative non-state method like state within state militia, control state government bribery forces. possibility lay dormant 2 weeks awaking host Doctor? 9th? 10th? 11th? important info! Fuck wfh never normal life spike protein mutations ones. Δ probably similar WT O. Also, B/T cell immunity probably work regardless. question well antibody protection is. DR Natural selection taken taking many ironically don’t believe either. Hydrate likely ready is.

It’s Europe; Asia Africa well be. evolved bad cold everyone could catch get immunity from, might best case scenario. doubt would happen though. Anyone know possible (for evolve much milder)? started seeing news futurama variant immediately scheduled booster. want go Sounds like cruise ships again. happens six months Omicron prevalent world? Keep isolating? It’s stupid policy never work.  Hard say. Right like Omicron still really early sure case loads are. 22 mutations spike, less Omicron 5 mutations receptor binding motif/domain. might come call I'm connecting tomorrow Omicron. Yes. Terrible luck award 🏆 Still late. based nothing “ohh variant scary”.

The world hasn’t caught normal now. infections remain rare. It’s perfectly reasonable continue living life mean? Guateng 2600 new confirmed corona cases Saturday alone.

Note sure many hospitalization figures case numbers new variant though. three natural immunity! 🏆

I got virus like 2 months vaccine available 😩

Nothing stop now! ::hides omicron:: yeah think end game hope turning another common cold like coronaviruses sort taken context, references two dozen young patients doctor shifts explain problem going potentially complicated hits older kind speculation that's really useful. There's way reliably infer anything virus couple dozen cases said, total, two dozen patients tested positive Covid-19 symptoms new variant. mostly healthy men turned “feeling tired”. half unvaccinated. Perfection  perplexing, relatively small number immunocompromised individual(s) much sway evolution virus? (maybe others)

I understand mechanics, start look like might empiric ~fact. Millions people get delta virus barely changes, yet keep finding cancer patients strange strains evolving (!).

Imagine covid infections relatively quick battles; people respirators usually fighting virus, dealing damage virus damage disproportional immune response.

Think virus found glitch immunocompromised individuals, like video game, found silly way gaining XP points crazy long infection lasts months. immune system there, strong enough completely kill virus, allows virus improve time, learning evade antibodies. virus escapes host leveled ridiculously, different strains circulating around.

Like sounds bit far fetched see crazy strains immunocompromised individuals, know happens, idea virology textbooks say it, guess reality care. According dad, virus created lab there's way predict going behave. (I support theory) Oh OK. Thanks :-)

My sarcasm sensor misplaced. article clarifies doctor health patients, would heavily affect variants Dr Coetzee, briefing African medical associations Saturday, made clear patients healthy worried new variant could still hit older people – co-morbidities diabetes heart disease – much harder. Basically simply - spread one spreads faster (because it’s fit) eventually replaces variant - like alpha original delta alpha remaining original. 

Maybe you’ve read delta variant found 90% cases (I don’t remember exact percentage) virtually cases delta now. may Omicron “spread faster” delta replace it.

Immune escape means vaccine may less effective Omicron Delta - don’t know case. said endemic extent. people already accepted covid part lives now, even pandemic ""over"" eyes experts, it'll still still outbreaks. need learn live virus. Yep. okay gun violence leads directly okay kids getting sick literally fighting easiest basic measures prevent it.   Unless death rate people change minds.  Thank science doing! don’t think that’s part he’s talking about, champ. United States, COMIRNATY (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine fully FDA approved. However, Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine still EUA. reasoning behind this? strange brain: 

Doctor Who, found Omicron.  It’s true, headline borders fake news.

From Dr Coetzee, briefing African medical associations Saturday, made clear patients healthy worried new variant could still hit older people – co-morbidities diabetes heart disease – much harder.

Omicron still probably terrible. Hospitalizations always lagging indicator hopefully that’s case here… ""extremely inconvenient""... Really dude? get lot leaf peepers early-mid fall lot skiers winter. Also, lot regional travelers come through, so, people NY, CT, RI go north go way VT. in-laws second home VT let AirBnB winter busiest season renters.   Helps staunch bleeding. Doesn’t heal wound, gives time get medical attention. 

So no, won’t stop spread aggressive variant, gives governments couple weeks study virus, build new boosters start distribute them, ramp hospital capacity can. Oh no..I sense Rand Paul attempting form coherent thought smacked usual Fauci ita idiocy. course  kids? know. making sarcastic comment current news cycle. almost zero chance it’s US.  Wednesday: went friend brother see Warriors play, drinks. 

Thursday: dinner wife’s family sometimes one friend family. 

Friday: lunch close family kids park kids play decompress cooking 

Saturday: met family lunch. Made last dish leftovers (basically moistmaker like Friends)

Tomorrow: lunch close friend wife, Hanukkah latkes probably brisket. 

I work ton. two kids. wife physician working ton too. I’m going enjoy rare time off.  Rhona Mitra Kate Beckinsale confuse well. Well, idiocy stupidity always seems *trump* common sense America days. still cause long-covid? read “Dr. Who” found omicron…  Man everytime go realize truly live bizarre alternate dimension. early mask decisions? hear incorrectly myocarditis tied vein injection (missing thr muscle tissue)...? Possible ~~incredibly~~ unlikely* Same. life went downhill covid hit. panic attacks agoraphobia. Isolation makes exposure therapy impossible. Sorry you’re going too. hope god variant isn’t worse delta. 500 daily number 5 days ago - much higher now, longer 10% Some, yeah. idiots also idiots, choose listen to... necessarily South Africa country continent itself. could easily lot variants originate South Africa nearby countries detected first South Africa due better infrastructure. BIDEN!!! [Here article early discussing immunocompromised patient remained infected (and infectious) five months dying. virus acquired 20 mutations, including resistance monoclonal antibodies treated with. booster shot got recently brutal side effects... almost point regretted taking it. 5 days horrible flu like symptoms, guarantee think twice another booster, even though know probably better get booster. “Sorry shitty brother Delta dumb anti-vaxxers. Here, take mild cold exchange I’ll deal you.”

-Omicron, maybe, hopefully doesn't. know they're using Greek letters, damn. Leg Day! Cancelling flights would work fantasy land  lab somewhere researching make coronaviruses contagious. Perhaps intent developing vaccine. name, right? Omicron might set success, lot future also depends us.

We're doomed Hate break but, I’m earth I’m ocean. page refer says 94543 covid deaths hospitals alone (in daily hospital surveillance report). die home nursing homes? count them?

Worldometers lists 89791 covid deaths SA refering page: 
 get it. someone explain numbers match? ❤️  read Dr. got confused. 🤣 Yup. Oxford, AZ vaccine Omnicron final trial stages they've working variant like since Beta days. likely Pfizer also this.  I’m quite literally college Got booster yesterday. Felt mostly ok morning, felt tired weird times throughout day. low fever 24 hours shot. Now, 31 hours shot, I’m tender/sore/uncomfortable armpit arm got shot. Weird. 

The side effects aren’t bad shot #2, I’m hoping wake back normal tomorrow. Looking forward peace mind booster bring though, especially new variant. Sadly many people live lives like isn’t even pandemic now.  agree general, still would prefer extremely aggressive policies slow spread enough cases outcomes make intelligent assessment. time needed adapted vaccine 3 months, that's much time need buy. kidding, anyone surprised? Eg. ""I’m pretty sure Democrats desperately seeking another lockdown 2022 elections…for reasons.""

Is everything agenda-filled plot people? lack reasonable arguments justify claims makes stupid definition, naïve *and* confident they're correct.

What happened public health issues public health issues? People afford eat restaurants go social events? Laughs college student. headlines I've seen trying scare shit us without knowing anything. Might well prepared wait. could ""outcompete Delta"" also evade immunity? spread? Current versions vaccine super effective wildly mutated strain.

I hate authoritarian approach one, Aus govt follow Israel...we starting open properly. late, plane load already arrived infected South Africa NSW yesterday. Yup. It’s official. COVID designed wipe humanity. rapid mutations, ineffectiveness vaccinated mutations, spread virus isn’t like anything I’m familiar with. It’s ramping getting deadlier. me! Heck announced yesterday UK shutdown airports south africa already late Yeah I’m aware? maybe stop saying things like “vaccines still work Omicron” past history indicated vaccines waning efficiency like 4 months. tell guys weekend? us typically, we'd dinner Thanksgiving leftovers like day two. panic tho Interesting, thought hadn’t sequenced enough viruses determine that, yesterday 100, thought? news articles

Every health system planet imminently fail according media

We’ve almost Covid live local papers full stories local health system collapsing. Mild covid still long covid detrimental vascular inflammation clotting quiet deadly. “mild” symptoms never reassuring covid. death rate always least consequential variable far.  Yeah like Spanish Flu still big serious pandemic 40 years later, right? folks eventually gain immune familiarity went away?   could taken 10k pretended get vaccine. Big brain forget Yellowstone megavolcano! americans holding concerts now... artists BTS holding concerts right now, past half year. omicron comes U.S., BTS's fault... Generally takes couple weeks get exposures hospitalizations. think jury still out. 🎵We place before🎵 Wow - media today like going Baskin-Robbins - endless different flavors choose from.

Everything ""we know weeks"" ""everything need know"". really start headline beginning 4 times thought dr.who  conspiracy theory thinking. early data indicated tons problematic mutations, natural would say that. disagree emphatically. one thing, country international airport succeed permanently excluding new variant. place hope delay arrival, buying time evaluate it, perhaps modify vaccines. benign variant hope is, we'll know soon enough. odds almost good dangerous. prudent course slow spread aggressively possible data in, enough case outcomes say sure grave threat. Masks, distance, travel restrictions, vaccines, every preventive strategy deploy essential, know. right, salvation predict delayed month two. wrong, reckless optimism prove catastrophic. mostly healthy men turned “feeling tired”.

If that's case I've living omicron since late teens. That’s damn bad!! statements like even .1% less effective make anti vaxxers say ""I told so"" say ""province"" outcompeted Delta universally, across South Africa. Details like behind elevated concern. 😶😶😶😶 capital cities even opposite banks _huge_ Congo river. Rinse repeat every 6 months?  Hoping same! Good luck us both. new variant change unvaccinated minds? Hell expect even spread death coming months huge problem vaccinated well. Surprised comment higher. plenty good reasons get vaccinated, holding out/unsure/hesitant/anti-vax, would definitely spurred news variant may make existing vaccines less effective. I'd wait next generation vaccines case.   I'd surprised Americans licking windows find it. year nucking futz doesn’t make current strategy effective. you’re blocking based identifying variants you’re blocking good sequencing programs. It’s token effort best. need start treating like slightly deadly form flu move one lives. clearly endemic variants stop. dull statement.

Maybe clear Biden, countries world vaccinating like everyone wants it.

Thing is, big hesitancy third word countries.

That overcome ever. can't force countries force population get vaccines.

For word, natural immunity way. look South Africa worldometer, deaths spiking cases rising too. I’m thinking still kills people. Sorry, 16 studies review consider massive outlier? fact getting downvoted says lots 🙁

I’m sorry situation, hope gets better soon. expect people stop traveling long exactly?  Get booster now, next booster becomes available, get it. Thank you. know resource. main concern Omicron many mutations spike protein, potentially reducing effect vaccines target spike? would prospect less effective vaccine spur people get it? I'd also watch UAE. think sequence huge amount banned SA flights major, major transit tourism hub lot tourism right quarantine (+the Expo). way made capacity. 90% fully vaccinated 30% boosted 50-100 Delta cases day. Omicron disrupts current numbers that's definitely bad sign Wear masks, get booster move forward. there's comfort knowing I've done everything possible protect family. Can't say everyone. Anybody got link actual research? Im wondering they're testing antibodies spike whole virus. Australia ""learned live virus"".

Just time *Omicron*. trust me, large amount vaccine hesitancy comes USA, American media, American apps development American influencers. eat shit breakfast. opinion 30% discrepancy much worse critical thinking USA. Wait, Australia total lockdown citizens accepts international flights? highly contagious lowest lethality maybe silver lining. People develop antibodies protected lethal strain comes. Two planes. 600 people total.  “Should” lot work title…  mostly controlled days.  past experience telling this? extremely sus entire world damn near watched India get ravaged delta variant without even batting eye. basically instituted travel bans shut borders dinner genomic sequencing released. Makes feel like there’s data that’s publicly released yet something. why? might start low-key panicking now, reserve right ante, running around lounge screaming whilst waving hands air later necessary. China knew viral outbreak 2000 feet BSL 4 lab one premier coronavirus research labs whole planet.

It's almost ideal place coronavirus outbreak get early detection. lab China could sequence virus victims could walk lunch Correction, 2nd inept - Alberta number 1. trifecta Sandro, Kenny Hinshaw anti-vaxx base pander stay power. mention blantant pushing public health infrastructure breaking point privatization agenda.

You don’t know good Ontario. good point Great stupid people even know started South Africa. first case found Botswana. Africa way vaccinated. fact people getting 3rd dose boosters everyone world wants vaccinated vaccinated huge issue likelihood dangerous variants higher. person variant developed could absolutely country vaccines desperately wanted one able get one. thoughts. fairness common cold still advanced there. Think wart viruses. Practically zero harm host even usually treat infectious. know. think they're unable separate message messenger, they've told hate messengers case, scientists Democrats. actually read article commenting?  know insulting compare introversion class actually systemically oppressed? Please go outside. Omicronous things really quite simple.

You sound *convincing*. full conviction. authoritative.

I'm starting see guys get roped things. sad thing. Wait people know they're allergic lol? Oh definitely started omicron booster already, prelim work least. However press release makes sound otherwise. Sad true. South Africa one countries Africa gene sequencing tech. 

Most central Africa even reliable electricity. could spreading months already. MMR one vaccine 3 diseases, yeah able smash covid variants one vaccine Technically yes, virus' ""end game"" . wants survive thrive. now, even killing people. parasite, trying keep alive.

Even delta, thing contagious harmful endemic cold flu viruses. even becomes lame duck highly transmittable, requires certain sequence mutations can't figure yet - duck could mutate line Yeah thankful, anxiety good 😅 article commenting literally answers question more, give chance. flight Belgium tested negative lateral flow antigen tests departure

It flight Netherlands. actually know many tested negative departure JNB (I able find info yet anyway). Netherlands require test connecting passengers unless destination requires - destinations require it, depending passenger citizenship, residency, vax status, etc. destinations require PCR antigen. without knowing specifics person group passengers, can't know some, all, none took test, type test, departing JNB. Especially Africa lowest vaccination rates world, variant originated there. First positive specimen November 9 South Africa. America probally never beacon anymore, days loong pal Israel confirmed case Omicron already. Nice try stop spreading Israel. Yeah I’ve gotten past point feel weird one masked place  Transmissible easily spreads virulence lethal know nothing people get variant, think expect good information Omicron 2 weeks so. Yes, everyone else confused. one knows real truth about... desperately nit picking CNN headlines internet.

Yawn. get lot anti-Islam people throughout Reddit. reason think Iran going attack Israel U.S would ever let happen. Buddy universe think Pfizer literally able work single vaccine time think people cities got food 1400s? think original commenter used words example top head… point lot panicky headlines. Trying gotcha “It WaSn’T ExAcT WoRDS oRdEr!” irritating internet argument tactic is. Thanks sources. seems like there's always bunch contradictory information early days. lol, even challenging narrative?

What post yours, entire thread, topic commenting article?

The entire thread, far tell, confused op even getting at, instead reacting word choice...then accusing others pedantic (when...maybe shoe might better fit someone else thread). Maybe allowed here, lied told vaccinated get third dose moment heard bad news Omicron. *Virulent* (of disease poison): extremely severe harmful effects. mean amount mutations Omicron it’s possible severity due tearing African nations unhindered due lack testing capabilities vaccine access? recall source 2? Israel always super strict swift make decisions. It’s line everything else they’ve done till previous variants. I'm normally conspiracy theorist myself, fact find laughable, I'm tending agree here. Also telling bad stock market dumped Friday. Typically see VXX go 22% based retail investor jumpiness... rather, that's typical market movers freaking eff out. Monday interesting sure. Ok I'm paraphrasing article, so...I copy another comment. It’s really quite simple. know COVID real, also know something it. Climate change real, don’t humans caused don’t know there’s anything mitigate it. mention, there’s evidence COVID manmade climate change is.

The thing similar two scientists flubbed handling making outrageous claims later proven false. blame you. Thank hanging long have. 

Quick question: would make stay? need $$$ medical community, time off, PPE? PCR tests, areas wastewater program monitors strains well. show sick, measure strains area. Yes, likely protection hospitalization higher 60% current data.  struggling find breakdown recent hospitalizations age group though. Everyone,  no.  non zero chance kills lot 1-2% infected.

So far infected approx 10% world killed approx point 02% it. 

Its realm possibility kill 1% population time done is.  deadlier strain could kill 5% something. 

I think likely happen people follow china's model lockdown areas military style. Viruses muttate whole host reasons, *just* identified sources evolutionary pressure. Previous papers shown there's [likely fitness associated antibody escape SARS CoV2, certainly possible increasing transmissibility beyond what's already occurred beta &amp; delta decreases virulence. opposite also true also ceilings traits. oppressed class.

Try one, friend. surprised. want force everyone lifestyle

Well makes difference want, environment going make decision us can't curb excessive greed. sucks least impact likely going suffer shit really hits fan. already happening South America, people fleeing floods.  evidence variant less serious? basically bare minimum would expect point global pandemic that's going nearly two years. HIV patients lead mutation great testing find variants. Well, continue be. Oh know testing globally designed prevent issue, sure there's margin error terms estimating long circulated, can't imagine week don’t get it, don’t Covid test fly? crowded spaces sick?  see easily prove (and even, demonstrably, something about).

Uh what? Wtf novel enough new strain, novel enough variant. Lockdowns return. Total world economic collapse so. returning. medicine liquid form goes arm ... works. Lockdowns useless cause harm. I’m tired interested happens covid…. Like interest burnout ugh. fear vaccine and/or immune escape. proven either become footnote. 

Cross fingers me, early looking good far. is, Pfizer moderna made multivalent vaccines testing already. Whether would happens don’t know, it’s definitely possible do. Yes agree vote first person lose right post social media find comment tiresome objectionable still early say Omnicron less serious though. I'm hoping is, maybe extreme reactionary restrictions response something powers keeping us.... I'm generally conspiracy theorist, eyebrow raising moment me. Bro invented something called ""vaccines"" “If worried, stay home live fear”— fully third selfish US. $ROPE GANG First iran covid, sad new normal Israel, least trying act preventive.  Let's Reddit. Yeah - introduce propeganda comment right perfectly exemplifies reddit hates people ready bullshit done Mmt. know every football game major super spreaders. Enough shit. quite proven large events really super spreaders all. I'll need sources tracing done. enough term. found why, started type computer would put correction mistake accept correction would move correct word behind another, weird. variant bypass vaccines reason get vaccinated tho? policies never intended stop spread, rather slow exponential spread healthcare systems overloaded. said, necessarily agree point. highly transmissible also highly adaptable, already 30 mutations spike protein means potential mutate way evades immunity. yet, fact clearly potential concerning. absolutely urgency here. sick people get still unknown -- entirely possible vaccines still keep people hospital. I’m hostile want force everyone lifestyle. Introverts oppressed class. Honestly, would hilarious kept Xi. I'm American virus named Trump Biden would also hilarious. 

Politics funny like highlight, age groups ratios (and even gender) UAE may think. population [UAE approx 10m , appox 12-15% others foreigner (!) Yes. whopping percentage... Like workers Pakistan, etc. practically young (and healthy) man. that, gender ratio surprise: woman approx 15% population. 

So, really great archive, covid related death week, amazing! know population pretty large percentage 50 (may around 75%), add bit bit context... taken context I'll need sources omicron killing. like pickles NashvilleHot? people level stupid. COVID19 first appeared effected sale beer USA. know sad  Pfizer effectiveness data people within 3 days symptom onset, 5 days Merck. Pfizer drug blocks viral reproduction, got administered early things get hand, challenging exponential growth. doubt many anti-vaxxers admit possibility covid short timeframe. days ivermectin get it, vitamin D, comments cold, ... Maybe unclear. can't wait covid disappear forever never touch another soul Earth again. I'm dreading, know I'm alone this, society's inevitable return old consumerist bullshit pandemic. rat race, Black Friday stampedes people literally trample death turn labor latest trinket ultimately end landfill year two, day ironically follows day intended reserved giving gratitude already have... pushing environment cliff...

For somebody trying claim superiority complex, sure sitting pretty high mighty horse. think world hostile introverts? pretty hostile me. will, take many months that. true thing many people keep wearing masks fine, many others drop calms down, can't mad that. much people say masks save lives, simply normal thing. knows here. can't say that. big deal people? Nu speculative name next Greek letter assigned variant. skipped ""new"" already different meaning several popular languages. 

They also skipped Xi political reasons. 

The official name Omicron came less 12 hours speculation since problem kind shallow thinking governments holding back. People making decisions based data don’t agree doesn’t really mean anything. Go live life whatever one cares anymore care others. imagine would possible multiple targets one shot associated increased transmissibility immune evasion

This mutation profile includes multiple spike mutations, including receptor 
binding domain furin cleavage site, additional mutations outside spike uncertain 
significance. Based location genome, structural modelling experience 
variants, **may change behaviour virus regards immune escape**, 
transmissibility, susceptibility treatments, particularly therapeutic monoclonal 
antibodies. **There confirmatory laboratory data**. (emphasis added)

In words, await data born stupid something honed developed time? Yes, anyone challenges narratives understand. Excellent way talk never reflecting. Yeah... I'll tend agree here. far points infectious less serious. ended Spanish flu. countries banning travel opposite Delta. Something inside says bad policy... Instead they're gonna corner Delta inside areas roam free destructive medical system.

I firmly believe omicron way pandemic.

 I'll take downvotes correlation Spanish flu ended. 

We're looking window opportunity here. Instead policy makers, OPINION, wrong thing again. failed Delta they're gonna fail let omicron shut Delta. Covid animal reservoirs, argument could “go away” misinformation. Covid already way endemic psychological resistance accepting reality I'd say already working omicron specific booster, prelim work, obtaining sequencing,organising research teams etc. However announcing like undermine trust current jab.

However whole original fast tracking running sequential phases parallel. Starting process relied previous results known. Would like see urgency here. Maybe unclear. can't wait covid disappear forever never touch another soul Earth again. I'm dreading, know I'm alone this, society's inevitable return old consumerist bullshit pandemic. rat race, Black Friday stampedes Americans literally trample death turn labor latest trinket ultimately end landfill year two, day ironically follows day intended reserved giving gratitude already have... high-speed pace late-stage capitalism pushing environment cliff...

For somebody trying claim superiority complex, sure sitting pretty high mighty horse. think world hostile introverts? pretty hostile me. gets us hell lot closer. 

We never hitting COVID zero. get toilet paper tomorrow? Probably best advice. meantime I'm back wearing mask outdoors. Hashimotos high risk group.   Exactly. N=24. N/2= 12 vax. numbers, means 50% vaccinated, 50% not. Ages unknown, “young mostly healthy”. absolutely way tell variant cannot (evade vaccination, etc.), based small, anecdotal sample. takes weeks sequence random samples. lag time lets say hasnt detected yet US course already Amsterdam flight indication. enough data know sure point. population Africa skews young death lagging indicator. Gotcha, that's promising. Okay. let's say 4 5 countries Africa end low vaccination rates. still end pandemic. Update: citizens residents don’t need PCR test flying back Netherlands South Africa. would imagine would account majority 61, small fraction potentially false negatives people caught test.

(Quoted info found r/southafrica subreddit. ) love Reddit. librarian loves research literal font worldwide information. vaccine way Juicy Fruit chewing gum. Nobody knows yet Testing figures include everyone. excess 3% population per day. Somehow we’ve managed vaccinate MMR polio much Africa. clearly it’s Africans continent won’t vaccinate. Loud minority find Mu sound particularly ominous, perhaps bad history cows… thing puzzles lack pathogenisis least early on. infected subjects seem exhibiting severe symptoms straight asymptomatic. I'm curious whether mutations conflicting ultimately working way. zero hospitalizations yet. least I've heard.... want make cruel surmises, case people poor countries Africa willingfully putting rope necks. going choose lesser two evils:

* Donate vaccines Africa, risk African countries also reject it, wasting vaccines process, letting variants pop regardless.

* Hoarding vaccines cause nasty variants Africa pop anyways time chance boostering popultions 3rd,4th,5th... doses *might* cause immunity rocket high, *possible* yet confirmed. Get thyroid levels checked recently Interesting. tested positive COVID yesterday (11/26) typical head cold symptoms since 11/24. 11/18 &amp; 11/19 extremely tired work, 19th went home slept three hours end day. Usually nap evening difficulty sleeping, slept like rock 10 hours didn’t get around 9am, still exhausted entire day. felt fine 11/21 11/23 started mild sinus irritation went become full blown head cold confirmed COVID. Interestingly enough, household member tested positive COVID 11/21, immediately got test 11/22 negative. also fully vaccinated Moderna vaccine since May.
 
The tiredness part crazy though. time life tired got home hospital stay major surgery.  Vaccines seem work quite well still, probably even better boosters become wide spread thing. couple reasons flights cannot stopped immediately. First give US citizens chance get home. Second, airlines need least little bit time plan get planes correct locations. Wanted butt ask, I'm work read everyone's comments, state booster shot vaccine status help strain?  Moderna, mostly Pfizer, Sinooharm little AZD Sputnik. boosters Pfizer.  Vaccines solve either since uptake Sub-Sahran Africa always minimal. basically bad science, tiny sample size (33 booster recipients) antibodies compared 1 week later larger group people recovered virus 2-6 weeks ago. Aside issue antibodies dubious way measure effectiveness even time scale groups. mean will… saying Hi there.. what’s name? friends call Nuzzi, call O. think want slow spread buy time pfizer moderna sequence check omicron variant test see current vaccines still work. 
  
They Delta turned need tweaks. think big fear Omicron mutated much current vaccine work effectively vaccine manufacturers may need modify vaccine similar modify flu vaccine every year. would require everyone get yet another booster. fabric face mask wake variant r around 9 10…. might well use garlic crucifix. Actually, we've run ""it ain't serious"", lots ""let's wait science gives us real facts"". seems one really likes anymore.  yes has? 100% confirmed obviously, far they've traced botswana many countries could identified said nothing? fact South Africa getting crucified speaking beyond me. still lockdown rules, masks mandatory since initial lockdown March 2020. Social distancing still required. 
As expect, overall fatigue COVID, people ignore rules, get called it. 
What irks Europe back normal, vaccinated not, masks, gatherings usual, no, 100% South African variant. Forget Hong Kong Israel also cases. need also concerned flights came countries see red listed.

Apologies sounds like I'm go you, I'm absolutely points valid. think see tone I'm super upset ""first world"" treats thinks beneath them. super country-dependent. 

Plenty vaccine uptake good depending country Africa. 

MMR polio vaccine rates high Tanzania Kenya instance. 

Saying “Africa way” like saying “Asia way” comparing Japan Philippines. There’s way variant would ever contained. soon travel bans let up, absolutely going spread everywhere sort odd another doctor come said they've mostly seen mild cases GP.  knew bad idea Michael Bay make songbird movie, call virus COVID 23? one knows. better safe sorry. semi capable governments understand that.  require pcr test flight? thing going away maybe seem suggest that. Lol news already acting like we're dead  Well, come better official names. Locals call DRC Congo-Kinshasa, RC Congo-Brazzaville, capital cities countries. They're much related, though. wife spent last 9months hyper vigilant get Covid expecting first child. baby 7wks old hyper vigilance continues. going get 5yrs old baby get vaccinated? feel like I’m meltdown   Wait... That's Americans Thanksgiving? beginning summer, way early tell. going difficult task convince people poorer African countries get vaccine, much Westerners hate hear that. Yeah nah. I've stuck three needles, fuck enough? referring to? “If aspirating takes…” you’re guessing?

It's claim, hypothetical. number matter; matters point that's made.

And point can't dismiss risk ""extremely unlikely"" injecting millions people. Especially risk entirely avoidable extremely simple change vaccination technique. 2% time highs thin volume big traders away Thanksgiving. indicator anything bit panic selling profit taking. omicron cases identified current patients? fear something zero control over? South African roulette Was? Im pretty sure Ebola still dealt disease. would imaging catch new variant immunity delta.  Considering many anti vaxxers good thing. Im India, exactly westerner. I've spent years life working NGOs places like Mali, Sudan, Cameroon, Senegal, Congo, Uganda etc. people regularly refuse antibiotics save lives children actively ill actively dying. think going challenge convince get vaccine they're even sick yet, idk tell you. Driving ton countries poverty isn’t going solve pandemic. 

Vaccines sharing scientific knowledge will. literally natural selection works viruses. Best virus features:

a) highly contagious (for humans evolution favoured transmission sneezing, coughing, kissing, sexual contact)

b) no, delayed symptoms

c) features evade/deflect/circumvent human immune system

d) rapid mutations help point c above

e) ability survive outside human body time variety temperatures

f) low delayed morbidity

g) rapid replication/hijacking host cell's ability manufacture virus

h) ability infect large numbers population various ages (certain race/ethnic groups specialist gene mutations immune highly resistant viruses)

i) Super Bonus - Ability cross species border infect multiple species.

&amp;#x200B;

There probably others, comes mind right away. virus many features tends selected for, therefore replicates. virus easily infect, replicate spread tends selected may even wiped out.  Right? feel like we're different data. 
None reassuring all. Hospitalizations Doctor two dozen patients half vaccinated country 25-30% vaxx rate? That's terrible. Something that’s way contagious delta gives everyone sniffles days would perfect see people saying “people need accept we’re longer pandemic now, it’s endemic, get used it.” International Flights? Wow. Thought was. 61/600 Amsterdam tested positive negative boarding. Faulty tests developed enough show 10 plus hours. basically zero protection going forward Travel Ban really? Cant Govenors make rules quarantine then, etc? Well tomorrow latest. sequence anyone's guess. Seems take 2 weeks. No, cases attendees spreading nearby communities be. LA require vaccination 72 hour negative test 13 actual concerts, even close foolproof ways prevent transmission. local group playing bar park nowhere near super spreader potential international concert series like this.

Each BTS band member base salary 8 million per year. guess thought wasn’t enough money without adding concert revenue resulting pr related music sales spikes. research want source thousands articles?   People omicron spotted climbing walls enter Israel, biting people neck Delta R estimated 5-8 read way, read saying surface appears vaccines still job. Oh no! aunt returned egypt one week us thanksgiving. Rigggghhhttt it’s drug it’s piece cloth.

A piece cloth 5%-11% reduction pretty good fucking deal  funny joke, dude. Stop spreading misinfo. Let’s forget restrictions last year. slops, shirts etc sold shops. destructive looting KZN July literally need every type business stay open. sure hell “family meeting” get told level 3 4 lockdown again. exponential growth bad something need shut travel? Must bad. I’m ready today. Shoot up. Don’t worry even running trials. saying literally entire point. know little new Omicron variant, based previous experiences new variants, expect one? colleges send students home return online classes? college hosting two week course New York City beginning summer, I’m wondering new variant affect course well gives peace. Sorry quick aggressive thing thing dragged driving nuts. know vaccinating Africa part solution, going bananas case Africa strictly antivax case we're doomed sorry chance ending people need us turned like us. guess counter argument would quarantining incoming travelers seems help keep cases low, border closures non-citizens make easier run effective quarantine programs since smaller number people entering. 

Of course, need ban non-citizens countries since Omicron lilely global already, guess I'd agree border closures specific countries make much sense. JAH!? 21hr direct flight botswana chicago. may community already country. may end then, mutation transmissible less deadly strain killed Spanish flu Anecdotal. data behind Serious question, chances another shutdown US? Considering career change possibility. comment wrong world. talking course somehow need make YOU. Everyone offended everything think world revolves around them. *She

Dr Angelique Coetzee it’s mild contagious saying 

Pfizer big trouble 

Vaccines won’t needed infected recovered 

Like common cold 

Bit Karma big pharmaceutical coming hope 🤞 

Would great news it’s mild 

Let rip Could also older individuals still traveling much pre-Covid ? Hearing reports variant designed intentionally released hence numerous specific ""mutations"" surrounding spike protein resist current vaccines natural antibodies. Yes, China also plenty domestic vaccine production. Enough happily sell doses countries. willing thing unless surplus.

You critical hear China, seems fairly evident population heavily vaccinated. I'm guessing article means R_t based recent spread SA, highly doubt there's enough data yet estimate R_0 (which number Delta - Delta hit R_t anywhere close 5-8 range ages). probably already vial  don’t actually know ultimately won't. news scared anti-vacc community would've done now. can't handle discussion I'd suggest stop commenting. One unvaccinated countries world increasingly anti vax sentiment suddenly gets ravaged yet another home grown south African variant. need completely travel banned get shit together. make sense. mutates get vaccin earlier mutation different many spike's area nothing different Delta doubt Omicron would affect all. source SARS claim? I'm difficulty finding anything, article people SARS back day stronger immune response vaccine now. direct flights Maun Gaborone US - show seeing direct flight? fact majority hospitalisations non double vaxxed shows promise vaccine still least significant effect ?

Well, 76% SA's population (all ages) double-vaxxed.

Don't know exact numbers among younger adults, *obvious* rates mentioned article significantly different vaccination rates population. eyeballing I'd say looks like there's probably still pretty sizeable protective effect fully-vaxxed, I'd want *much* precise numbers rates involved making hard claims that. Real redditors would never let stocks dwindle far ask.  think confused -- US citizens still come home Monday, subject testing etc. that, stopping someone getting non-US citizens getting plane randomly dropping US. Biden specifically (if little confusedly) said immediately Fauci's advice, Fauci's advice echoing exactly happened Delta. second reaction always heavier. measured people getting covid second time 6 months. wonder high response would Groundhog's Day since March 2020. Clickbait. news sources need alarming headline get click first Japanese coworkers USA come work sick take mask they're sitting desk coughing lungs out. Let's put away stereotype japanese people love wearing masks. 🙄  Thank you! Hope friend okay!! Yeah would really bad wasn’t preventing hospitalizations fully vaccinated young people. 

But doesn’t seem great even young people 1 mRNA shot getting hospitalized. 

And someone breakthrough case delta 2 mRNA shots, tell still sucks lot. I’m one “lucky” long covid sufferers now. 

And sounds like could maybe bad unvaccinated people. fear mongering handful subreddits? real life hear people saying “another variant? damn.” That’s Everyone wear masks public indoor spaces permanently, flus, colds pandemics, airborne illnesses would cease exist. People tired unfortunately. Everyone wants move on. longer goes people join crowd... Even ones anti vax anti mask crowds. 2 years advanced society compared 100 years ago I'd much different. Everyone fed shit lol. I'm concerned soon kids it. guess nowhere near able know yet. Gotta keep narrative relevant, old one worn out. ? far would logic (in loose sense word) impacted Omicron ? weird. 7 years ago caught heavy duty bug laid low 16 hours. Massive fever fatigue. Woke feeling fine. days later noticed thyroid bigger.

Doctor gave meds and, mention sick, said virus probably messed thyroid. right rain day two.  planning trip Morocco January. First international trip outside US since covid. Someone give straight, chances still allowed happen? point one point surpass Delta Variant origin Mumbai Region India   early data South Africa, officials say omicron fueled recent outbreak breathtaking speed, suggests new variant already spreading quickly delta. populous Gauteng province around Johannesburg, share swabs tested positive coronavirus spiked 3.6 percent Wednesday 9.1 percent Friday. country bracing possibility public health systems becoming overwhelmed. Exactly. quantity. measure quantity spike antibodies. sounds similar case Mary Mallon aka Typhoid Mary. immune system strong enough counter Typhoid body never strong enough kill it. Thus became carrier. Similar immune system strong enough counter Covid strong enough eliminate virus patient's body. Would accurate comparison (With obvious differences course)? Hey since mandatory? seen news I'm sure family masking up. live japan literally 99.999% people masking up, I'm flying see family couple weeks (great timing..). I'll 100% masking usual want stick lol. Well around quarter South Africa fully vaccinated (and less 30% least one dose) it’s saying much 65% cases unvaccinated 70+% population It’s nice real president again, wonder really wrote that. Ever think folks hoping Covid kills understand that, different kind masks accomplish goals different effectiveness needs said. 
What people asking “how long?”, first waiting vaccines, near year two pandemic mode, everyone tired wants resume living. forgive impatience think discussion trying achieve important. thing going away, never. maybe talk happens next. main reason many detected cases vaccinated lies fact majority cases detected flight passengers likely vaccinated anyway. variants coronavirus continue emerge merge I'm concerned lack direct communication public.

 realize mutations virus rate situation part continues change whiplash inducing really feels like world's governments understand what's going release information true nature situation six month delay intentionally. 

I know want widespread panic I'd almost feel calm knew certain information state affairs matched mine, better worse. Especially initial months pandemic proved us key information (i.e airborne transmission, little surface transmission, lingering airborne viral loads public places, etc.) withheld. 

But guess easier partially clue everyone bark conspiracy theories eternity tell truth. hasn’t stopped doom articles. defence South Africa, *discovered* it, *shared information* countries could identify it, *penalized* ""index"" (origin) country. 

At time, way ascertain Omicron originated South Africa. 

Shutting flights might smart two weeks ago. gone far make difference point. 

Sooo...end rant behalf hard working scientists South Africa. 

Let's pray turns nicer, kinder COVID.  tweak Pfizer Moderna Delta around? tweaking Omicron? People plain S-T-U-P-I-D. damn narcissistic Botswanians!! Assholes swear ^

""evolutionary pressure"" way complicated people think. long efficiently propagate kills host, whether years like HIV/AIDs, weeks, little pressure evolve less deadly form.


Smallpox around like 50,000 years example (variola major) kill rate 30%. like what's happening SARS-2, genetic diversity lead wide variations rate, variola minor kills 1% example.


Without human intervention selecting benign variants ""letting rip"" ""waiting seeing"" think would real pressure evolve kills enough hosts meaningful impact ability propagate, like large proportion humanity would die. sequencing takes several weeks US, tests US come back positive negative. Maybe speed up?! course already People vaccinated getting covid, guy Italy double vaccinated household got infected, even younger children. they're protesting vaccine mandates, restrictions? Article really say.

I feel like speak majority middle pro vaccine mandates restrictions (unless hospitals overwhelmed happened since May 2020). extreme opinion? isn’t. longest direct flight 18.5hr JFK Singapore. Prepare worst. Hope best. Tried true strategy. submission removed either repost, clickbait low quality submission. Please review sub's rules, particularly rules 3, 5, 6.

But wholesale country closures ineffective. much winning.  find new mutation covid  spike's . learn immune system works better focus spike. right antibodies. make sense lot antibodies work mutation. Yea agree this. still early tell impact vaccinated vs unvaccinated. find new mutation covid  spike's . learn immune system works better focus spike. right antibodies. make sense lot antibodies work mutation. Africa continent, geographical unit. country. Get bidet There’s already different mutations samples collected point common ancestor around October 7th. It’ll refine samples identified sequenced. evidence making vaccinated folks sicker Delta, though many detected cases vaccinated (this may sampling bias). vaccinated, there's particular reason worry getting Omicron.

What terrifying prospect winter wave supercharged crazy infectious variant that's hospitalizing 20-40 year olds heightened rate. vaccinated self may safe, may SOL need doctor hospital reasons. know say, COVID omicron Persei 7, Humans omicron persei 9 want sources. find information? better ready back claims make forum, GTFO. Yeah anecdotal quote without good source lmao. best actual leader, would say silent part loud. end world. Panic now. you’re talking ass. stop it. You’ve clue you’re talking would better suited commenting conspiracy subs. downsides aspiration? make shit you’ve done? Like risk infection aspiration 10%? pharm techs MA’s aren’t trained way won’t able vaccinate people convenient settings? vaccine hesitation increases 10 fold severe bruising, pain, discomfort injection site?  

BRING ACTUAL SCIENCE SUPPORTED REAL DATA. said infected people instead lab. people see said now, hopefully. Lol. ;) Hopefully that’s case say anything younger severe. Maybe low numbers could effected elderly yet?  secret high transfats.  least stay school board meetings. Doesn’t mean like them… people love them, find awkward, normal basically reminder bad everything is. use asked to. I’m quite tired would like ramp, can’t keep living pandemic mode. 

Also cute “talk therapist”, maybe talk it… therapist hates them. Dose 1: May 5th 
Dose 2: August 6th

Double pfizer

I'm kinda wondering go booster offered Canada, heard they're moderna boosters though, regardless pfizer before. #🤷🏻‍♂️ feel like hear every single new variant (or even different waves variant). wonder much severe actually younger people compared OG strain.  swollen lymph node, totally normal go 1-2 weeks. one swollen neck, side got it. I'll probably get swelling get booster. :)  Nope. certainly still screen quarantine people traveling regions low vaccination rates and/or high case rates. Amongst things.  mean covid delta plus 5g already obsolete Kevin background You’re right. don’t know you’re downvoted could used dam emergency slide socially distanced tarmac Pfizer said would take 6 weeks get needed. always skip one virus cannot believe stupidity humanity decided us solid Fox News turned politics religion it’s infected everything. Since people thought delta “last” variant, possibility one 64 mutations arises Omicron?   Anyone thinks contain variant delusional. day age folks jetting around world nonstop. Every place get everything. 


All delay quickly variants spread. Anyone else feel sick stomach? someone hasn’t seen family 2 years travel restrictions, don’t know much take. Thursday felt like finish line sight, I’d finally get see family, sudden it’s like we’re back March 2020, idea bad it’s gonna get.

Fuck Fear mongering   California seems avoiding massive wave started absolutely annihilating us last year around time. matter fact, Hospitalizations lowest they've since July idiots don’t even know difference liberal, socialist communist.

Don’t waste breath. i'm quadrupled vaccinated. 1 J&amp;J vaccine - 3 pfizers. (oh, still wear mask pretty much wherever go). r.disabled   I'll note chairwoman quote comes seems downplaying severity symptoms. article ends chairwoman also criticized decision countries ban flights South Africa premature enough information dangerous is.

She also says variant seen vaccinated individuals, absolutely false. I'm sure trust information. saw guy injecting vaccine boost bridge day. Good him.  Feb 2020 : pandemic

Nov 2021 : gates hell US 70% one dose, within next 3 4 weeks 70% fully vaxxed!! Testing widespread, one highest world per capita believe.

You need 'green pass' go places, fully vaccinated means get PCR every 30 days.

My work makes get PCR every 2 weeks, every week pandemic.  us pretty significant (temporary) side effects, especially second dose. I've 2 MRNA doses plus natural infection, I'd like know good reason put though that. Plus possibility 4th dose omicron several months. Well there’s Covid, there’s everything else. you’re screaming internally: you’re paying attention (or don’t care). Even right. Letting spread like wildfire based evidence milder moment risky, could kill many wrong.

Everyone knows barriers stop omicron, slow down. Enough gather info.

 turn milder, allowed rip through. Restrictions come. sake buying extra weeks assess, correct decision pandemic trial run climate crisis. happens viral level hours, take decades climate. Thus, test well society capable dealing global crisis situation. I'm afraid society spectacularly failed test. Quick context: \~40% PCR tests positive Czechia variant testing great either. would surprised omicron case. Then, depending government, possibly still 0 irrespective findings.   Pray Australian citizens. hope y’all leave house without beaten Outcompetes? like host one them, or? [Hindsight concerts LA

You show proof vaccination. LA surprisingly strict last weekend.  still numbers seem support US natural immunity paradise COVID longer risk, compared Europe.

Oh, absolutely not.

People succumbing wishful thinking last 21 months. go again. That's quite high horse there. keep touting ""scientific method"" ""analyze data"" refuse practice given every opportunity.

You objective basis assertions clearly interested political discussion, rather scientific one. know pharmacist mused would willing take supplies walk nearby streets giving shots could approved. frustration strong community. Uh, no? Idk think israelis inclined follow orders.

I'd say army make inclined follow orders; quite opposite, learn deal bullshit. Much like everything else life, idiots everywhere times get dumb officer. dumb officer lot like dumb manager/boss.

Yes indeed quite fascinating able see realtime phenomena previously relegated textbooks time information widespread. People act like pandemic unique dangerous historical context got profoundly easily. Delta definitely scared people getting summer. Numbers shot spreading lot. Vaccine: preparation used stimulate body’s immune response diseases. Vaccines usually administered needle injections, administered mouth sprayed nose.

I meant these. detect? lmao cant even detect normal covid, brainwashing continues hopeful I’d like be… remember thought Covid mild flu based early cases? depends define long covid. People use term everything “any symptoms 4 6 weeks positive test” could benign lingering cough long term debilitating symptoms.  Yeah literally got Moderna booster last week. Really frustrated this. sounds like friends “waiting” get booster (so putting off) actually going protection concerning new variant actually got booster time. Viruses reproduce much faster humans, evolve faster well. think lot talk healthcare systems ""collapsing"" US hearsay, overcrowding due COVID concern something prevented getting people vaccinated.

Imagine someone sick covid full mouth open exhaling long left right Don’t forget claims “500% infectious “ 🤦‍♂️ Thanks this. ‘many early infections spotted among younger people likely experience mild illness’ then, true, could good sign, no? thought one worry mutated virus could cause worse illness even young? Omicrom isn’t surely good sign? 

I’m clutching straws I’ll take anything! Omicron growing 5x weekly relative Delta Johannesburg. Using 7-day serial interval people therefore claim 5x contagious. 5-day serial interval 5^(5/7) = 3.15x contagious.

But way distinguish change contagiousness change immune escape. instead assume complete immune escape (escape antibodies therefore sterilizing immunity, escape protective immunity infections see mild) get completely different result. Based [60% pre-Delta +50% deaths Delta wave, 85% population immunity seems like good bet Johannesburg (similar Mumbai). 5-day serial interval makes Omicron 3.15\*.15 = 47% contagious Delta, 7-day serial interval 5\*.15 = 75% contagious.

The actual situation could somewhere between, course. know spike genome antibody evasion going incredibly high, result large drop sterilizing immunity. easier said done. remember said forming new ""treaty"" combating future pandemics. cool, two things:

1. done EONS ago. I'll never understand people always act tragedy.
2. treaty right air. untangible, also stick fighting *current* pandemic rather *juggling playing hero* words. militaries world COVID? Maybe what’ll irreversibly cripple entire US military arm cutting manpower damaging mental faculties survivors…? short trading day short trading week. tomorrow could bloody hell. I’m referring specifically virus. completed third paragraph comment would know that. really. mutates longer lasting strain mean strain somehow less likely mutate itself. virus ""cares"" proliferation life.

I like compare COVID Republicans. care birth spreading species, care live die. talk much sucks USA Today seeming go-to newspaper hotels now? Used NY Times, Washington Post, LA Times, San Fran Chronicle, even WS Journal (pre-Murdoch)... shitty USA Today, written 5th grade reading level. Wtf bizarre lmao side effects seem way worse flu vaccine.

Setting aside 'severe' reactions affect small percentage population, agree statement side effects reported COVID vaccination people took it. data back up? several commenters thread mention day two illness second/booster shot, side effects seem vary type vaccine took (globally, Moderna/Pfizer), large effects equal greater flu shot can’t plan kids. mentally exhausting. people vaccinated less 6 months ago. worst covid country earth, USA... fucked... problem ban justified ?
It’s justified variant lethal vaccine resistant. However given knee jerk reaction corners may set bad precedent constant travel bans specifically towards poorer nations completely agree, also think it’s news outlets’ fault, soon omicron discovered knew nothing several news articles came claiming vaccines may useless turned echo chamber reason people choose believe news article experts saying vaccines still provide protection. Naaa, get vibes. Actually mutates slowly compared viruses (mercifully). HIV common cold mutate exponentially faster, that's we've never able control them. makes COVID 19 noticeable airborne easily transmitted. Part public policy working wrong decision easily reversible. Border closures suck reopen heartbeat. possible, requires EVERYONE playing team.

it took nearly decade extra covered effort eliminate smallpox (think got right)

it would easier vaccine lasted longer perhaps eventually mean abandon best shot eradicating covid

just something requires effort mean really. 0.25% entire US population dead. several states 0.4% entire population dead COVID, low IFR makes sense. turns milder Delta...shouldn't want outpace Delta? possible 'messiah' variant I'm thinking April highest peak 4000 something. seen 1000 months soon. shot increased body’s defense reduced transmission! Dutch National Institute Public Health announced 13 Omicron cases Sunday, **but noted investigation ""not yet completed""**, meaning new variant could still found test samples. warned it. obviously earlier poster right. areas US lot sequencing.

For example, New York city’s variant reporting US done terrible job” misinformed statement essentially treats large country monolith. It’s works. 50 states, health department policies.  Thanks! Whose fault though? public health officials emphasize permanent masking social distancing skepticism irrationality amongst already irrational multiply. 

Similarly constant statements “you must still act like it’s 2020 even though vaccinated vaccines don’t eliminate spread 100%” ( supposedly consortium world renowned doctors epidemiologists) competent destroy chance convincing holdouts get vaccinated 2 weeks flatten curve ^ This. also banning travel dozen plus non-African countries detected? No. got booster - matched 3 🤞🏼 Easy say deal either.

How's weather Scotland? Dutch government dare quarantine people hotel compound whatever, like New Zealand Hong Kong. People get ""compulsory quarantine"", home, there's systematic check fine oblige. They've tested 14 people positive Omicron, 550 still test positive tomorrow. bet real follow up. People asked politely go testing, sanction don't.

Both Prime Minister Marc Rutte health minister Hugo de Jonge unfit task. vision, want please everybody, always late ""party"". thing react instead act. reaction always late. sounds bit strong, maybe. Certainly bit self defeating helpful neighbours Unless brand new COVID, suspect status quo out. discover variants may may infectious/deadly fully vax experience mild symptoms, vaccines intended do. intended prevent infection, mitigate severe illness. unvax...I mean gonna gonna virus gonna gonna do. well countries Latin America, like Ecuador Mexico. better response would blocking flights SA, providing country doses desperately needed. Governments acting quickly? Australian government shit. They’ll let know sound like delightful person. holiday season, fun timing. literature long takes happen? I've wondering too- theory says virus selected less lethal, yet reverse seems happening, wonder takes decades hundreds years equilibrium established.

 Maybe ready pool unexposed people infectivity way important selection pressure long people get sick die quickly pull circulation. 

Then number hosts declines ( immune) infectivity without sickness becomes important giving time given host spread virus without dropping death severe illness. 

It's certainly fascinating watch evolution real time ( pull back fact life threatening illness making life shit!) 

Wonder intelligent design crowd make it? seems LOT people asking exact question lately. answer definitely get scheduled booster ASAP. could months vaccine specifically designed variant comes out, data suggests booster that's available still effective Delta actively-circulating Covid variants. There's simply good reason delay. always get ""adjusted"" booster later. Except fact aren’t administering vaccines intravenously rare cases myocarditis it’s one brand vaccine higher others. let first point sink way in. heart related side effects something concerned (now FDA researching it)? Ok, way know many available doses have? I'm making guesses here. problem lack vaccines alone, could fixed inefficient COVAX mechanism. problem vaccine hesitancy alone, government grow pair make people take jab. problem lack vaccines hesitancy, respectfully, SA doomed. Thanks link around paywall masks”Many passengers ignored mask requirements, said.”  Popping Winchester 7 - 10 days. Coming with? 700,000 Americans enough severe case died, majority unvaccinated. I’m thinking singular case may really prove much Lol anybody downvoting this. problematic thinking. Things like travel bans huge. Huge. type measures can't decided lightly, like lockdowns. can't forbid people certain country preventive measure - huge precedent. 13 cases Omicron. seen research this, see reason vape smoke would spread covid person's regular breath. would say infected breathing, would dangerous sitting living room breathing breath vape smoke. Ugh. Ok. literally simple google search subject actually want look available data, look ""scientific method"" want truly understand scientists analyze data reach consensus way deciding want interpret data applicable scientific method. clearly interested. 

Good luck next wave. No, collective problem, like collectively wear masks vaccinations, countries collectively work vaccinate everybody.

It unfair blame South Africa, far difficult vaccinate country like that, compared country like US. can’t shut world economy forever. Trade happen. fact despite Herculean efforts complete police state China can’t completely stop virus tell something. 

Once spread places like India Africa over. 

Since clearly know epidemiologists would done? different game Today in: “Take novel virus seriously know does” What’s going ischgl  seems like natural solution prison. Self contained isolation cell. Door opens outside armed guards can’t leave. compare brain fogs brain damage, please. story keeps getting weirder. South Africa problems access vaccine, it’s people refusing vaccination US. China's cases come abroad. cases begin decided stop it. FREE MONEYYYY I've got booster scheduled days. feel like cancel wait see there's going changes made vaccines due omicron variant. Anyone else position? Afaik. South Africa place far confirmed community spread Omikron. That's sets apart countries imported confirmed cases South Africa. 
 
It's buying little time, ""punishing"" South Africa - sporting victim complex helpful all. clarifying example others read won’t discount random rumor, instead actual portion sequencing findings. likely already here, case actually confirmed, can't say definitely here. complicated.    talk largest defense budget world nothing stop American deaths. Seems like defense knows kill people. Disappointing tbh, country lost war virus, thanks citizens leaders. right, referring 3 rhinovirus species cause colds (and dizzying number variants those, tend escape immunity other).  I'm suck tired Vanilla? Since started naming viruses ice cream cake flavors? never enforce 3000 dead day enough people states. We'll never see true lock unless they're actually enforced businesses police. It’s still disease. chance suddenly changing extent affects young significantly severely unlikely. lethal MERS contagious Measles, even Florida Texas would lockdowns. matter government point... individuals shelter would die pretty quickly. people Ireland still going we’ve 2G since July. people think would benefit introduce 3G beyond me. Maybe whole world population already got infected virus 50% effective turns people whiny little bitches. Seems reasonable explanation. intentionally ignore estimates many 80% Americans pre-existing condition.

Haha, 80%? Overweight obese alone makes 73% country. Hell, work time I'm overweight eat big meal. No? That's said long weekend... doctor A1C test every year, normal? Forgive asking... Google popped things people actually putting hand sanitizer nostrils, vaccine still process. I'm going worry choices others make, love life enough want keep mine safe. finding clear answers. search parameters might off? still pockets unvaccinated Israel. Better safe sorry. democratic governments think followed zero-CoVID strategy are/were Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan Singapore (if count democracy). effective long periods time places well.

Vietnam also successfully followed zero-CoVID strategy year.  submission linking thedailybeast.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

The thing is, much anyway winter chicago area lol NPI’s South Africa moment? I’ve read lot early spread attributed university parties. Probably like least couple weeks ago. boosted. worry much, probably would wear mask unless asked to. No. People still fight lockdowns mandatory vaccinations tooth nail.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  TIL viruses kill infection, covid Given prevalence HIV already South Africa, it’s interesting see relaxed take Omicron compared western world. supposed difference constantly living disease not. No! NOOOOoOOOO!!!!!!!!  someone lives NYC that’s lie lol. Vaccinated boosted masking distancing????? Wtf one That's happens infected traveling. It’s crazy y’all still even care stuff much. Live lives, sake humanity. Peace love. Everything relative. Life eventually kills everybody. take risks order live lives every day. humanity minimizing deaths costs. Hmm yes makes sense. Tell what, I'll delete comment then. likely. came Thanksgiving. wife booked #Delta flight two days ago SA Boston transiting Amsterdam, denied boarding Boston due rapid COVID negative test. pretty upset, time life upgraded business class. denied blessing disguise, made would stranded Cape Town. Mom (90) devastated never made it. Hoping still get chance go back see soon. Maybe I’ll win lottery charter jet fly see her. Even 1,000 day Texas Florida lead change state policy... would need least 1 100 people die month they'd change.  Probably would kill it. think surface transmission rare.

I still use hand sanitizer matter general hygiene, really think particularly needed protect covid. US never lock terms stay home order etc. political financial support. Without it, order lockdown ignored. Aha ok. 🙏 ""Slow know it,"" means acceptable populace. 

If people slow ""it proven threat,"" surprising; disappointing. before, 2020, ""it proven threat."" many take vaccine even now. reason: denial.

So are, experiencing Delta Covid already circulating, causing thousands deaths week US; menace, especially older people, even vaccinated. variant mutations known increase transmissibility--something has, last two variants, associated doubling virulence new variant--and change spike protein conformation--something has, last two variants, impaired antibody binding.

And listening people forum, places, claiming ""we know enough worried."" People already ""unworried"" enough delta bothering booster, someone stupid, malicious, merely ""conservative recommendations"" told ""immunity wane, improves time, like vintage wine.""

This March 2020 again. know variant do, ""novel virus"" implies. Anything else wishful thinking. turns big deal, fine. let's least consistent approach, people. urging vaccines unvaccinated, urging utmost caution policy respect Omicron, prepared support whatever NPI needed next-gen vaccines effective treatments readily available--several months now. It’s required get yearly flu shots work, travel, go school. Also, clarify saying conspiracy nuts saying along people would required get multiple shots, even yearly covid shots blah blah carry everyday life. side, lets say majority reddit, news, media, calling people crazy basically saying “get vaccine end covid”. it’s less severe would lockdown didn’t delta? adults yeah! think rapidtest.  Covid reason become mild infects killing; virus would prevent spreading killing host. Rio 0.5% population died think Mexico city 1% died Yes, reported double vaxxed thought possibly didn’t need it? get booster? Enter ye seek knowledge. thought previous variants already resulted increased rates reinfection case unexpected unless increase rates reinfection far higher before. People equate forced business closures mass unemployment lockdowns, right oppose happening again.. Canada reports first Get booster you’re eligible. essentially isn’t going fully evading MRNA vaccine. Half US never locking circumstances, regardless fauci recommends Lmao Americans. I’m sporting event I’m forced wear mask. I’ll go take food local restaurant!! lockdown sucks!!!!! Thanks correction! point draw attention level precaution widely accepted -- people wear seatbelts -- opposed risk mitigation generally seen overkill, i.e. wearing helmets. think we're reaching point, highly doubt want strict lockdowns lower already low risk essentially zero. healthcare workplace gets flu vaccine every year number call in's booster. I've never seen flu. got booster, take Advil fatigued. different vaccines flu. Still needed, side effects there. Right winged politicians thinking: vote lockdowns. could easy get elected? semantic, way talking mutation evolution dominant variant. booster, I'm deciding better wait scientists research vaccines effective Omicron, changing dose size effectivenes, vs. better get booster ASAP. Anyone care discuss pros cons? thing isn’t fully evading MRNA vaccine. Get booster shot (if eligible) don’t panic. found Canada. actually surprising taking US long find case. Perhaps long weekend.   go fast? Even emergency approval first vaccine took least 9 months. slowly increase deadliness multiple strains people become complacent death, especially become overwhelmingly dominated unvaccinated per capita. Pretty definitive USA much anything stop pouring continent via flights Europe NYC. even PCR tests, nada. 

Just got booster. Pharma saying probably modify vaccines Omicron within couple months, distribution. know, taking precautions weeks figure bad is, nope, option. I’m confused whether get booster wait. Question... Omnicron thing... things like Lysol spray kill it? use sanitizer things like bank card use, hands... spray lysol items. soo many sick, refusing wear masks... public ""dirty"" me. politicizing things bad behavior openly sneezing coughing others. honestly want catch anything... but... methods kill whatever No, don’t think anything currently US currently called lockdown. referring comments US lockdowns point, New York California arguably had. This. point someone gotten plan clearly going get it. Realised recently speaking new co-worker mine unfortunately anti vaxxer. insists vaccine needs research tested properly keeps banging already got natural Immunity covid back March last year. Nit pick: affinity maturation happens 6 months first dose, booster. booster tricks now-mature b cells reproducing, giving many them. they're still going take days figure omicron. Perhaps educate yourself. assume things? There’s chance lockdowns regardless, least nationwide case. Florida Texas locking down, matter what. New York California, might. Or…a bunch triple-vaccinated people habitually wear masks public getting harangued shamed attempting live semblance life two years constant stress anxiety. asymptomatic covid, barring loss smell taste bit. 7 months food like onion garlic smell absolutely unbearable since issue vaccines take two weeks effective. double dose vaccines take 2 months really. forced vaccinations general international travel non negotiable requirement point. 

And subject vaccines, South Africa go two winter waves without vaccines. developed countries hardly went one. low vaccination rate also partially comes fact people don’t see point rushing get vaccine it. Similar Joe Rogan. Bad logic is. Why? Kind problem, that. Considering there's still global pandemic happening. keeping eye new variant. way world leaders reacted makes alarming. know something don’t know Unless get clear proof Omicron Big One, nothing. I’m recently boosted, I’ve found KN95s actually comfortable wear indoor public spaces. however still *going* indoor public spaces. point effects mental health outweighing risks bodily health. Without age distribution vaccinated, half vaccinated unvaccinated doesn’t say whether significant protection vaccine close none! right here. variant transmissible Delta yes fully expect reach rest worlf become new main covid variant. least travel bans buy us time kind figure everything exactly plan is. Like vaccines still work maybe work speeding boosters etc. also possible losing sense taste leads people yolo sugar? strict hotel quarantines AUS NZ worked wonders. Let’s hope one overtakes Delta won’t worry much going forward. Yeah, mean I’m guessing Israel here. 

I wonder intel really saying strain. likely isn’t going “viruses get less deadly” case none would happen. Yes. I've also opinion changed way. I'd venture say effective trading cable news talking points day points *designed* emotionally effective (to draw clicks eyeballs) impossible difficult dissuade someone of. limited one side other, either. way win hearts minds start position empathy completely avoid morass politic-tainment.  Confirmation bias powerful force people like uncertainty. entire pandemic people inclined accept statements already believe demanding much higher standards evidence things go current beliefs (if willing consider all). Additionally answer questions omicron ""we know"" people tend keep asking/scrolling/watching trying read info metaphorical tea leaves rather sitting tight that. 

The endpoint vaccine trials protection symptomatic infection. vaccines protect spread decreasing duration severity breakthrough cases preventing cases first place. know vaccines behave omicron. sera neutralization studies soonish (within next weeks) reasonable proxy still study efficacy actual humans. I'm gonna go dont quite know yet.  Literally website article published hours ago second case confirmed. think two cases tested positive yesterday today good sample size make conclusions? I, people love. 

I'm glad doctors who've worked hard treat cure dismiss disdainfully. ban flights UK Alpha identified? honestly remember, think not. Yeah saw get implemented last week. think Hochul going able hold much longer rest upstate mask mandates given hospital capacities.  I’m Kitchener/Waterloo/Cambridge area weekend huge difference attitude mask wearing COVID general. haven’t seen single nose outside moms house since got here. think so-called ""developed"" countries developed people imagine be.

I think pretty obvious point even stupidest developed countries best interest people vaccinated globally boarding plane.

I strongly favor going door door forced vaccinations unless medical reason to. Western leadership weak. Legally, plenty reason forced vaccinations, whole economy going drain. Without working economy, even government left continue way. Well fluke event, else everyone lives apartment building would've infected now. played family recently. mom(57) unvaccinated 2.5 weeks mild case (this sickest I've ever seen lifetime). sister BIL (both 40s) also unvaccinated spent 3-4 days I'm hospital. BIL oxygen home weeks.

My sister vaccinated got covid, sick one day. Based this, mom claims covid ""no big deal"" vaccines ""don't work"" problem could possibly mutate deadlier version. takes many months affinity maturation. Breakthrough CFR seems bottom around 4 months second dose likely minimum. 6 months good recommendation, pandemic ends it'll surely stretched longer. 50% death rate? No? Well, lockdowns then. Unless Omicron way worse Delta (early indicators isn't) there's chance US locks down. I’m sure it’ll international information sharing session. Given amount independent actors play (both individuals governments), along amount time takes understand transmission, severity, immune evasion, idea something hidden public doesn’t hold much sway. problem heard would risky give virus many opportunities mutate even more, none knows next mutation could do. could indeed check git new commits variants appear diff them. Neat! Think 2022 common cold point. Yawn.  Misinformation illegal, simple assume case fatality rate 0.35 %, seems unlikely given seen Covid do. recorded case fatality rate 1.6% USA 3% SA. We'd assume South Africa missed 90% cases US missed 75-80%. seem realistic me. 

I've worked bad flu seasons case fatality 0.1 even sniff this. 
Even use assumed case fatality 0.7, would mean 50% population infected then.  2-10% Anyone spouts misinformation basically killing people opinion read article posted? anyone else feel like divergences know strain telling us?

or abundance caution, really?

I'm fence myself, looking gauge thinking public Right. 1000 dead day enough. rooky numbers. Thanks response. live state weekly data dumps. mention, low testing seems norm. control choices, considering going back n95 masks rather surgical masks. Might re-evaluate 'exposure budget' well. Nah, 10's thousands people going die along millions going suffer long covid. /s flights? countries know something dont? Jolly irrelevant. Four people family knows vaccinated died Covid past couple weeks. It’s freaking parents etc. pretty much stated ""we know yet"" everything website today Totally, need spread own. Yeah dare awaken us consistently fucked situation let us know things ok.  
/s called mRNA vaccine already engineer :) direct misunderstanding immunity works. They're high chance antibody neutralization (from vaccination previous infection) nearly zero, meaning people immune previous strain mostly catch omicron easily. antibodies easy measure (and cellular immunity takes months develop, long wait research) they've fixated throughout pandemic. 

The reality cellular immunity still work, take days scale up. would mean vaccinated/recovered people would spread omicron, (as we've seen already) likely get sick it. would unvaccinated risk. 

Get third dose. call toxic Ah, apologies. we're supposed feel bad overworked healthcare workers prioritize unvaccinated.  I’m triple vaccinated Pfizer ready jump ship Team Moderna. Whatever takes help get mess. least control. Get 1000 people covid 1000 people ask suffered long covid symptom following infection non-infection. great control people know whether they've covid not, least would starting point. Since long covid symptoms broad hard know whether caused covid coincidental timing. OK, I’m going assume good faith here.   
Let’s get caveats way first:   
I epidemiologist, doctor, etc. job solve pandemic don’t ton novel solutions.    
Being victim something doesn’t make expert eradication make one’s job fix explain it. like minorities aren’t hook solve/explain racism, etc.     
But, given that, constructive thoughts:    
- probably us closer think. Got friends relatives older? Anyone chemo family member chemo? autoimmune diseases? thrivingly healthy person turned thirty. loved ones could vulnerable one day, especially never gets fixed. may feel different get 80, spouse gets cancer, etc. So, that’s important bear mind think rather attitude hear waaaaay much ‘it unvaccinated’. Remember, comment pointing existence unprotected, vulnerable people. And, course, doesn’t even address millions people vaccine access all.     
-Things don’t binary. seems people imagine either total lockdown (which actually experienced), total free all. suggestion caution gets accused something like ‘wearing masks everywhere forever’ hysterical hyperbole. So, reality, maybe would make sense apply things somewhere between, like maybe masks subways planes good idea (even flu tbh). Maybe could special shopping days movie theater days masks only. Etc, etc. lot possibilities ‘all time everywhere all’. also applies to
lockdowns, travel restrictions etc. needs researched, planned sensibly best benefit cost ratio, implemented properly (none nose mask like toddler stuff, etc). And, would great occasional accommodation vulnerable things hard make safe enjoyable everyone, like movie theater example.   
-Personally, think get everyone vaccinated least slows spread saves ton lives everyone. huge logistical social issue. Way big solve.     
-Don’t assume people like taking precautions expecting anything aren’t already trying do. three full strength Moderna shots even thing I’m going two Pfizer doctor’s orders. doctor track advances avidly moment, kinda suck vs vaccine protection. great happening, everything helps, I’m gonna bet life 40% reduction mortality cohort 42 times risk dying. Sporting events? don’t even go grocery store! Basically, people I’ve touched besides partner nearly two years healthcare providers. I’m relatively privileged doctor don’t go bag groceries something. Many people already even restricted average person ever be. I’m pretty resigned idea might never go eat popcorn movie theater again, I’d really like able safely fly coast see parents die old age.    
So, basically, I’m saying, less polarized/absolutist discourse around Covid protections? Keep mind blamelessly vulnerable exist likely one day. try keep open, compassionate mind. really ‘all together’ bunch us get disregarded safe? “Enough people don’t hate already.” -Dr. Fauci  pfe shareholdes keep ip, thanks can't responsible health fucking pandemic, that's absolute nonsense.

People can't quarantine indefinitely inside homes, I've often seen people suggest. That's completely fucking unreasonable.

People societal fucking duty everything protect fellow men countrymen disease that's damn near killed million Americans.

You say 80% severe cases obese? Well that's funny, majority Americans fucking obese. Genius. Nailed it. almost like America unhealthy country vast majority population something increases susceptibility COVID. 

Sorry, I'm done polite. Shit arguments. People need right fucking thing stop selfish, entitled assholes.  Let give u analogy. It’s like boss telling employees might decrease pay, added responsibilities without extra pay, starting sometime near future. small group employees start freaking out, another group chills saying nothing happened yet mention boss made announcement past without changes actually happening. months boss informs employees decision made pay decrease. group freaked pissed upset. group chilled shrugs shoulders tells group stop complaining, lucky work it’s beneficial company needs decrease pay order keep things going. Point story, chill group allows others rule without question complaint.  It’s also interesting look SARS MERS precursors current pandemic. fortunate asymptomatic spread wasn’t much issue those, public health measures able contain became global pandemics. 

It matter time something similar SARS could bypass public health measures still deadly enough cause substantial problems. public health experts reflected SARS prior 2019/2020, would often speak hypothetical virus less deadly virulent, perfect storm disease. That’s basically got Covid-19 I’m going lose it. early? Ya think? aren’t locking regardless? Delta Aug/Sep second coming dooms day lockdowns kids going back school.

Enough shit. one person infected 61 people one flight ? need big jump mortality rate see sort lockdowns US. Why? Actual story - misleading Nov 28 (Reuters) - Americans prepared fight spread new COVID-19 variant Omicron, soon say actions needed, including possible mandates lockdowns, top U.S. infectious disease official Dr. Anthony Fauci said United States must ""anything everything"" amid likely cases variant, ""too early say"" whether need new lockdowns mandates, Fauci told ABC News.

It’s early say whether needed. Don’t play God. reason mess, potentially, cause people tried play God. Sadly won’t last long. Eventually run everybody. lot anti vax people going get sick shrug scream loud “see, told didn’t need vaccine”. Americans traveling anything? Stop trying create straw man.

Believe not, Americans free access information, Chinese not, majority see Chinese point view, except selected few. Yes. here. great American said: ""If stop testing right now, we’d cases, any,” That’s thing. didn’t think. engineer contagious variant causes extremely mild disease. chip shortage.

clearly reason there's chip shortage they're used mind-control chips. Get vaccines, time us move new endemic virus. ones vaccinate, need work go school untill don't. don't, thier problem. variation magically going chenge make vaccines ineffective. probably stupid question, hope pandemic ends, create covid variant lab, contagious make sick, outcompetes delta Omicron?

Would playing god somehow make things worse this? depends define lockdown. I’d say New York California pretty serious restrictions  Compared covid something worry about. pandemic ends need solved, likely reducing dose size spreading doses more. something that's likely appear older get, unlikely ecdn without covid going around. First two mild inconvenience. tired. booster though kicked ass lol People lockdown states (e.g. Oregon, Cali, WA) going non-lockdown states (e.g. Idaho) events, - coming back. good stop movement 70% us - 30% damnedest become superspreaders. 

Honest God hope Omicron evade vaccines. kicked ass two years got depression asshole went fishin' buddies every weekend gets ill die with, I'm gonna haunt whole fuckin' planet. last thing need statistics. People know city shutdown, can't go work, restaurants closed. counter measures necessarily massive outbreak everybody know. Contrary might think, rumors run like wildlife social networks. suppressing them.  low vaccination rates mainly richer countries able buy way vaccine priority list.  

Nope. Nov 24 (Reuters) - South Africa asked Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ.N) Pfizer (PFE.N) delay delivery COVID-19 vaccines much stock, health ministry officials said, vaccine hesitancy slows inoculation campaign.


They plenty vaccine doses, problem one take them. 

Less talk, read. made post forum yesterday promptly removed title didn’t match title (?) live interview. sure supposed work.

The interviewee Pasi Pentinnen EU spoke early observations Omicron (which hadn’t even named yet) gave rise question vaccine prior infection based immunity work new variant, maybe monoclonal antibodies won’t work either.

This forum echo chamber Pollyannas. second booster anything. Time important number doses. Get 6-month booster worry another 6 months. hope ones already gotten work this. virus joke. Way soon… G7 also meeting tomorrow urgent health meeting. really going lol still travel Australia unvaccinated. medical reason vaccinated need exemption travel required 14 days hotel quarantine (unless also get exemption that). NSW cap 210 unvaccinated arrivals per week.  copy-paste, quite quick really. Imagine pathetic enough original author. Yeah exactly. everyone wants complain ""we can't go back lockdown!"" never lockdown begin with. Literally guy responded talking able dine indoors like 4 months. That's ""lockdown."" expected. Dum dum mountain really crowded place. Stranger things happened, so……. science quite clear need wear mask third dose. should. People mostly dumb think smarter you. I'm ""fuck em"" stage. Tell go home figure out. Ain't nothin hospital bunch scary science shit anyway. people never fully locked down. live super-leftist state locked early hard legally... could look window watch smokers area congregate, maskless, multiple families, day. heard people work talk going meet friends house, finding anything could do.

We never locked down, whole country. people refuse vaccines refused sit house long enough stop spread.

It's like saying condom stop pregnancy, turns someone wearing nose. I’m vaccinated, wouldn’t think it’s safe go travel?

Because still spread new variants, like people Australia saying vaccine doesn’t work

It works, work 100%. work slightly less new variant long vaccinated continue exercise caution, generally safe. travel?

It's safety yourself, safety others. One person seed started Australia's current delta outbreak example, want person.

I'm arguing overall perspective, I'm currently travelling myself, think glossing stuff say considerable certainty evade existing immunity greater lesser degree. think that's important know, can't help you. Erie county NY new mask mandate public indoor facilities. 81 year old suspected omicron case experienced mild symptoms rest family. must positive. Yeah, that's happening. mere mention word sends chills back every dem running 2022. sort toxic messaging GOP supermajority Senate. vague twitter person knows 100% immunity SA Ask doctor first. guessing slim

Most people getting boosters, yes people would definitely get omicron booster. US country world vaccine uptake higher countries Looks like mandatory ask doctor get new 2 shot series modena phizer booster.  wonder though much better air circulation scrubbing would offices reopened settings hallways connect supposedly “private” spaces. 

Our reopened offices California already allowed masking long currently presence anyone else. You’re required remask soon possible see another person. sincere doubts protocol effective even Delta. I’d love see emphasis air scrubbing hallways possibly bad circulation, hotels don’t seem terrible general. rooms HVAC system pull fresh air window air exchange systems. Covid reinfection, novel concept haven’t heard canad throwing away vaccines expiring AZ shots recommend getting abundance mRNA wild card it’s mild, still trigger longCovid son turns 7 next month, sore arm shots. neighbor reported two children! pump new vaccine quickly delta vaccine? Would better giving everyone delta booster, mixed variant booster, booster based original variant, capability there. Second this. Ordered year them, kid powcom kn95 too. usually find coupon shipping free.  So, basically boils hindsight 20/20?? correct?

What find scary posts like fail place blame trump admin. addition, lack political context, erodes public trust CDC time important ever. purpose post? think failures trump admin attempts weaken public trust government institutions continue? think weakening trust CDC appropriate new variant emerging?  sources time say cases   investigation, right speak. early disease course.

Quite right. Severe disease come immediately. people were, we'd point fizzled much another winter virus comes goes without roar. scenario proposed someone covid Twitter last day so.

Basically speculated due multiple massive prior waves covid South Africa may close 100% immunity (total natural immunity plus low levels vax-based immunity).

If Omicron really spreading fast claim speculation may due high levels immune escape opposed increased transmissibility. hell? would put danger? No. COVID matters. Duh. chances SARS-Cov-2 already done reverse spillover back horseshoe bats South really are. There's reliable way find underground water beyond surveys existing wells nearby Yes! thinking restarting series wanted check! Yep. tradeoffs giving political legal freedoms. 

Pesky. 6 year old got second yesterday. He's seems totally normal today, even complained arm (I asked). Head kisses show fever. seems wee bit tired, sleep well night wakes early af sure they're related. reading evidence far, Seems like similar Delta, infectious. vaccinated people seem fine.

But yeah still early sadly keep seeing comments around here. freaking hyperventilating much? got Pfizer vaccine. far know, myocarditis pericarditis potential side effects J&amp;J vaccine, could mistaken that. knowledge gaps remain different conditions result coronaviruses passing bats humans. Dynamic integration among field studies, modelling, laboratory experiments human epidemiology required understand processes **prevent new coronavirus spillovers pandemics** (emphasis added).

I wonder realistic goal. Given large population bats, wide geographic dispersion, complex interaction humans bridge species creating surveillance network seems technologically daunting inevitably clash various human rights. Early detection--as opposed outright prevention--seems realistic aim research program. Um last saw 59 percent adults. received one shot? Definitely due next. think start mix matching now. that's terrible example best thing have. wanna bathe every time business alone this. elderly preconditions hiding away young people think freedom infringed allowed parties. Even pensioner needs go sometimes shopping, hospital visits, pay taxes, etc. self-isolating almost two years now. constant struggle figure necessary things without exposing potentially life-threatening infection. little patients people tell virus conspiracy infringe freedom. 

They would change mind virus mutate kill young healthy people like Spanish flu. Let's hope happen. Lots democratic countries taken super seriously continue struggling. 

It’s funny somehow every country failing control containment country incredibly opaque undemocratic regime somehow cracking code?

Maybe?

But tradeoff even worth it?  gf got type 1 knew college. autoimmune disease triggered viral infection. understanding that's common way get type 1, triggered another viral illness. really prepare ! Serious ! Thannkfully vax free everyone available..💪🏻 It’s everywhere. Omicron everywhere. point this. want follow science recommending travel bans. one give fuck Africa. That’s what’s happening. UK especially turned it’s back first sign trouble one former colonies. 

As long mines don’t stop know one really gives shit. son got second shot yesterday morning. side effect sore arm told sore asked was. problem reasons believe might dangerous.

Multiple mutations spike protein target presented vaccines. Laboratory experiments engineered COVID virus similar spike protein changes led escape immunity conferred vaccines previous infection.

And appears may spread much much quickly highly contagious Delta variant.

Fingers crossed benign. really sick tired COVID. tired blood oxygen saturation 80% though, there's that! info? laugh.

I literally never said that. Looks like looking opportunity appear smarter everyone far. merely stated info far SUGGESTS it. make conclusions ""laugh"" at. merely stated may fact bigger fish turn much highly transmissable delta regardless fatal is. stated, see. merely wanted discourage statements suggesting worry new mutation ""fear mongering"" may fact something worry about.  ER nurse (US). It’s super common, nut starts hurting real bad, go ER. nurse worth salt triage seen quickly (loss life, limb, senses priority number one - testicle counts). It’s reversible, go right away, save testicle. Also, word drop “torsion” they’ll get straight ultrasound check blood flow.

It’s generally worse women - ovarian torsion. Mostly “abdominal/pelvic pain” common complaint, often less immediately critical, triaged lower - meaning wait longer. many potential problems abdomen/pelvis, unless someone obviously excruciating pain, wait people heart attacks, strokes, massive trauma get taken care of. Yes, critical issues need worked up, abd pain patients often discharged home without needing intervention. Depending location, especially COVID overwhelming healthcare system, it’s unfortunate people wait long, long time seen :( We're screwed: there's ""Welcome"" sign airport. Source: Buffy. Great Firewall watertight trucker hat. Tons people outside China know Chinese. Even foreigner ever learned language, got millions Chinese people moved know language.  Yeah, got preserve mental health, reading many negative posts/comments take toll you. get blood test labcorp tests nucleocapsid antibodies spike protein antibodies. theory goes covid, likely nucleocapsid spike antibodies. vaccine, spike protein antibodies. thought covid got blood test getting vaccinated turned didn't. Apparently 1 brand PCR test picks Omicron. yes tested negative, obviously infected Omicron already. probably cases caught airport even plane.   neither stop happening, lets pretend like lmao. becomes endemic reproductive number = 1. Aka massive surges slow burn society. Same. Pfizer. understand it’s difficult remember like hindsight. there’s reason got bad initially. it’s wasn’t taken seriously. Part wants set Joe Rogan treatment centers unvaccinated would diverted Ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, zinc, vitamin C palliative care, precedent sets far uglier implications even massive problem we're trying solve.  mean like barging comment sections ask questions easily answered simply reading article everyone commenting on? variant evolved independently delta right ? delta++ hence separate name China country amazing. 

China CPC bad. [incivil ban worthy comment involving death despite sympathy] 1 turns straight second turns back gay. 
(I’m gay. Let make joke.) Right they’ve cooperative they’re known upfront honest. Riiiiiiiiight. Facts. Ok, way know many available doses have? 

16 million. wonder kind changes healthcare system would need undergo admit that’s point we’re at. Would pop-up emergency care become norm, traveling around areas hospitals overwhelmed? Would provide funding covid beds, even covid-only hospitals? Would covid shots stay free forever (likely requiring ongoing government funding)? 

I’ve seen lot speculation workplace practices, working home, major changes may affect jobs. haven’t seen much discussion healthcare system look like current strains (and associated severity) endemic. Yes definition recently changed realized current vaccines effective creating  can’t use Xi don’t offend China…seriously. point ""entire US Military"" vaccinated doin fine. That's article amount variant identification America low likely time give case already thousands. hardly contact tracing thousands become millions even act. missed something though. local province level China's government lies downplays everything. 

The city level authoritarian lockdown came exploded big problem hide anymore. [There's need alarm,  Dr. Theodin: [watching armies people admitted hospitals] begins... Unless mild, would make really good. Yep I’m South Africa trust know. know. heard loud clear. first hint trouble one really gives fuck Africa. hard tell days lol amend organ donor status specify want lungs going antivax plaguebearer? would scare them? 

They got vaccinations right? Agree.

As unvaccinated fond saying, “It makes sense live fear."" nothing religious texts encourage getting vaccinated stop spreading disease. fact, common underlying theme religions respect health life, anyone considers religious get vaccinated.

In words: God made possible vaccine exist. getting vaccinated, spitting face God.  dunno, people pretty scared Jan-Feb last year. I’m sure anyone sane claimed would mild. did? believe asked J&amp;J Pfizer stop sending many vaccins, enough know what... South Africa's case numbers declining months hospitalisations stuck higher previous waves. Evading rapid testing may explain things. Since Omicron different Delta, would possible contract time? Maybe even two? Like covid Royal Flush effects declaring endemic? feel like circulated lot among certain groups expect it’s declare endemic, everything goes back COVID. actually happen declared endemic? I’m South Africa. Honestly feel like west likes wear Black Lives Matter shirts point fuck else. Omicron shown straight complete destruction African economies means nothing western world traded first sign trouble. 

Omicron everywhere. it’s cheap political trick fuck Africa show countries something.

Really, one gives fuck Africa. say quiet part loud. hear anything like that... (United States) haven’t locked like past year half. don’t know everyone acts like lockdown even table. like 2 week lockdown March 2020, states soft lockdowns another month so. like 50% bar restrictions, every thing fully open basically whole year again. 

People act like mask mandates recommendations “lockdowns”. Question: Omicron variant variant referred South African Variant back earlier year?  different one? Israel best intelligence world. anyone know bad, them. could see spooking people think getting boosters like Delta spooked people thought getting first. two weeks examine deadliness. 

If three vaccines don’t work significant decrease fatality (personally expect will) we’re screwed confirmed easily spread? hear here's would post First all: CDC acknowledged myocarditis risk quite time. new development [redacted] thread suggests. date [CDC says Nov. 12 that's latest revision. [first May 27. CDC conspiring hide anything [redacted] uncover Viral infections like COVID-19 common cause myocarditis. true COVID-19 vaccinations may also cause myocarditis, risk negligible comparison. Myocarditis incidence [146 per people get sick COVID-19. myocarditis incidence [2.3 per vaccination. Moreover, reasonably suspected people get myocarditis COVID-19 vaccination would also get myocarditis COVID-19 Myocarditis also equal myocarditis. Myocarditis result vaccination mild 76% cases intermediate 22% cases. Severe myocarditis like one might get COVID-19 might long-term effects observed result vaccination. [Severe indeed 50% mortality rate 5 years. there's easy way avoid severe myocarditis: Get vaccinated!

u/hypekit, u/christopher_mtrl, u/laserinlove everybody else: find fault above, please, let know! think so. willing right thing *now* based information everyone currently has, everyone else still vacillating. do. pay enough attention. foolish dangerous too. Many wrong things could done name ""defending lives"". always Reddit stockbrokers like this? Yeah, family that's gone rabbit hole. Reality become inconsequential - believe Covid risk vaccine safe personally hospitalized it, even there's good chance they'll still denial. point make sure rest us vaccinated boostered. hope Omicron turns much Ado nothing, there's amount facts get people vaccinate voluntarily. nice real president all. study outlier real takeaway vaccines important. takeaway covid infection superior vaccine. definitely don’t know something isn’t already there. taking extreme precautions *until* understand better.  Israel pushed harder vaccines. quite time define fully vaxed 3 doses. f... Around anymore it. want people party streets new years eve that's lock down. USA issuing travel ban small letters ""only non US persons"" anyone citizenship green card bring shit home. know bad omicron is. Thus, making lock two weeks may turn nothing burger. However, case omicron bad suggest, time implement measures prepare hospitals.  Yes know lots mutations.

That doesn’t change fact literally way Israel enough time properly study variant attain info aren’t sharing rest world *Record scratch* didn't. I'm group also curious well. won't. Spoiler alert already everywhere. number cases detected directly correlated regional sequencing capabilities. Nice one. key difference Israel knows something, mostly every major super power, would keeping secret, none opted total lockdown. come? anything might change mind? Living Switzerland, understand Deutsch Swiss girlfriend, would assessment list above;

- Restrictions inline number IC beds available country. Additionally I've wear mask public transport entire time, case lot northern/western countries.
- Vaccine hesitancy true absolute disgrace. mostly concentrated among German speaking towns (not cities) still describes large part Switzerland
- Almost every guy went army gun. Shooting Vereins also hughly popular here. Switzerland also relative lower murder rate despite guns I've never seen someone carry gun (unless soldier public transport)
- country side conservative, major cities quite progressive seems everywhere world.
- Absolutely true
- Absolutely true  Along line reasoning, SA rest global south pays dysfunction societies practices led climate change.  possible, yes. Since people infectious serious symptoms set in, I'm sure there's much evolutionary pressure become less lethal. here, man suck ass long flights :-( countries started analysis old samples fwiw haven’t seen finding secret huge numbers Omnicron cases. virus actually came China history hiding things rest world. 

This variant come Israel. detected first case yesterday since found 7 suspected cases. 2 days' worth internal data variant. know anything know. analogy China fit here. quote new Wheel Time show Amazon (that's pretty good), plays heavily concept reincarnation. trying play ""stuck home watching streaming shows"" (like Tiger King) theme, deja vu concept previous lockdowns pandemic. interesting see develops coming days weeks. know 32 mutations opposed 3(? I’m 100% that) delta. They’re playing odds game one ends worse/more deadly/ transmissible/ etc. locking accordingly. every country done 2020 wouldn’t mess we’re applaud least taking seriously information arises. many governments people flipping variant many previous variants detected? makes one different?

So far seems like vaccines work it, big deal? I'm wondering worth uproar, bringing back mask mandates, etc... Feels like overreacting. mean HOPE that's case, ends nothing, keep this, people tune take future variants seriously. Aye, see too. I'd gone one alternatives priority group. end assigned AZ irrelevant. booster though I've gone moderna. might seem strangely specific, anyone experiencing stomach discomfort typical even Thanksgiving? 

 Started feel funny morning.... [don't “If food fixes hunger, get hungry again?” flights Netherlands ""tested negative"" allowed fly.

No didn't. swamp thing reference b Rate 80s horror flicks missed? Yeah....probably :( Inees second booster shot. feel like one enough. That's true

""It first detected individual returned Israel Malawi. Saturday night, seven cases evaluated – four returned abroad three not. verified case fully vaccinated. suspicious cases, three fully vaccinated four others not""

It break whether ""from abroad"" cases vaccinated not. first case traveller, vaccinated (obvious, vaccinated travel Israel). 7 suspected cases, know vaccination breakdown respect travel That's good sign least.

I mean, know COVID contagious. learned anything new here. 8 individuals sick, asymptomatic? hospital? things matter. brother-in-law two-dose Moderna series six months getting J&amp;J. I’m quite sure pulled off. find pharmacist mass vaccination site doesn’t bother ask questions. Wishful thinking. Covidiots never give medical freedum. Omicrkn sounds super badass. I'm guessing time next year, think though. Thanks. basically staying house forever now! messaging great immunity complex predict future. know effectiveness would wane. always knew J&amp;J quite effective mild moderate disease, effective hospitalization worth delaying weeks find different vaccine made sense populations unlikely show twice. 

So mostly complaining lack ability predict future there. 28 Days Later.... America finally beacon light world 💪 🇺🇸 data set 7 people isn’t enough draw meaningful conclusions mention, fact persona adorable pine marten, mad that? :)

There's even company selling authorized plushies character. cute. Plus happens huge fast rising wave.

Most people world form immunity. really unlikely we'll find back March 2020, even lots breakthrough infections suppose free view. Please post can’t see it.  told thing December 2019 China started locking large swathes country probable become variant concern too? Geez thank work! There’s gonna plenty ups downs whole thing goes away. stay strong, we’ll get there!

I think it’s good communicate concerns new variant, it’s still early tell bad is. lot maybes moment. 

Maybe vaccines perform fine. Maybe transmits like crazy replaces Delta, people don’t get sick (hoping one). maybe it’s setback need another booster 6 months. maybe ends like variants concern never even reached news. dropped folks airport 2 weeks Arizona. left March 2020 Minnesota hadn’t back since. dad going stir crazy wants open condo, come back MN Christmas, fly back AZ January - April. told last night multiple times today surprised won’t returning MN Christmas. folks careful time - vaccines, boosters, etc - especially mom high risk. Now, seems really stupid two weeks AZ. dad also really stubborn. So, is. gave double hugs. always everyone now. never know you’ll see people again. gave double hug aunt died shortly thereafter. Sigh. Good thing im getting booster Tuesday. Hopefully late a, know, March 2020 type thing. Hope doctor fired him. strain covid spreads like wildfire, less virulent, could actually good news.

Don't tell media desperately hanging onto COVID fear/doom stories.  check flight first sequence November 9th started looking actively now. good weeks spread least. hardly immediate … maybe 30 days. Good times public health service! Sad hear it, I’m sure relatives thankful. Fam, think this, thought food poisoning tho sister-in-law nurse husband doctor working South refusing get booster ‘because don’t know works’.

Thank sharing this. doesn’t change minds nothing fear patients. conspiracy theory thinking. Like rest world, bringing measures precisely don’t know enough reason warrant caution (and Israel typically cautious countries comes borders). possible know much stage. kidding, people ICU asking vaccinated. help it. people referring screaming abuse doctors nurses diagnosing COVID. ""It's scam, can't wrong!"" try spin want, show work data. doesn’t work way you’re saying. Source? wow, true, big hit economy.

Israel pretty much top vaxxing rates…so must really concerned know something yet disclosing. fair, caught Vanilla covid February (before vaccine available age group), vaxxed April, got Delta October. live high allergen area, based experience Vanilla decades seasonal allergies idea \*wasn't\* regular allergies lost sense smell again. symptomatic difference infections night day me.

I'm still masking, way I'll social distancing rest life (suits fine), probably also get Omicron too. body appears decided best Pokemon game ever hate it. it’s happening again. might much worse elderly relative home soon. Ok mask wear visor get it. could wear reusable gloves stopped virus. read 0-micron (0μm) I'm Ontario we're better restrictions I'm sure people would happy comply full lockdown vaccinated well. We've come live level restrictions think people would react well ever went back April 2020 style lockdown vaccines even proved effective covid uncanny sense timing… first outbreak wuhan occurred ahead new year festivals caused large spread across country world.

now mutated variant appears ahead thanksgivings superspreader event winter northern hemisphere/ xmas nye.. govts let run wild? locking weeks time late Continue you’ve doing. risk calculus different others regardless COVID not. likely cautious winter well influenza parainfluenzas remained risk well. 

Vaccinate, continue using available NMIs, push policies help mitigate risk.

But kids go back school point. People need work. can’t isolate forever degree risk everyone. sure you’ve shared correct link? one wants wear mask, choose N95 protect themselves.

I wish could transition trying mandate masks everyone, this. Israel know don’t? seem concerned variant. Contagious bad serious infections? lol fuk shipping everything else like currently is, case, would ballgame. Correct There’s way Israel able complete efficacy transmission studies 48 hours. Well, article provides much plausible (and sad) explanation. manners co workers still show sick brag vacation hours dont use  High transmissibility mild version Covid would good thing - would quickly drown strains cause far fewer (relative) fatalities. saying little difference 18 year old told get boosted, 17 1/2 year old. immunity wearing 18 year old, would think 17 1/2 year old boat. Wouldn’t 17 1/2 year old school working public need booster than, example, 18 year old takes online college classes doesn’t work? saying isn’t good reason 18 cutoff (maybe evidence 16 17 year olds won’t breakthrough cases). saying told 16 17 year olds don’t need boosters 18 year olds do. Seriously. Like they’re following book. I'm Twickenham well. usually like living Rugby miserable. Hate coming home uni go well way roads closed. Nothing wrong comprehension. Everything wrong banal focus. thankful enough show grateful work, hero! Same. pharmacist flu shot fine hit nerve Covid booster. happens. :-(

If put warm compress twenty minutes ice pack twenty, really helps. took 3 years Spanish flu mutate enough become regular flu, applies virus, got least another year two this. Why? Doesn’t sound like work epidemiology anything. paper.  Given many people traveled weekend states, probably right :(  You’re projecting. don’t sound informed topic. 

You pro vaccine still acknowledge natural immunity superior.

You sound like political zealot. fun extreme. Don’t forget use promo code ‘COVID4EVA’  bad reacting slowly.  
  
This simply wrong. stop think second potential cost each. wonder salary people oversee she'd tune. boss, gotta go work, well compensated it. Cry river. People work remotely pandemic should. simple. hero needed.  get feeling governments know something telling us mutations Omicron Could always reverse ban turns bad feared. Can’t put genie back bottle it’s already international flights.

""If non-U.S. citizen nonimmigrant (not U.S. citizen, U.S. national, lawful permanent resident, traveling United States immigrant visa), need show proof fully vaccinated COVID-19 travel air United States foreign country.""

""At time, air passengers ages 2 older, regardless citizenship vaccination status, must show negative result COVID-19 viral test documentation recovery COVID-19 board flight United States.""

[CDC: Requirement Proof COVID-19 Vaccination Air  That's get everyone around vaccinated. 1. learned Delta.

2. cases increased hundred cases two thousand 2 weeks.

3. mutations thought increase transmissibility partially evade immune response based similar mutations variants.

4. Seems possibly outcompete Delta.  

5. Local transmission seen one (or two) countries. stupid article Yeah I’m getting downvoted oblivion said “hey maybe they’re telling us everything know yet shut super hard super fast whilst simultaneously saying panic enough know yet”. I’d love wrong whopping big old deal nothing I’m gonna air side caution say shut hard fast maybe it’s reason? got Pfizer booster felt like complete ass 3 days. guess worth new variant rip shreds. every country done 2020 wouldn’t mess we’re now

Honestly, hindsight 20/20 country would've risked economy back something like info Covid.  They'll able focus long term effects, whip HIV analogy. 

I taste headlines already:

""MINIMAL SYMPTOMS, DIE TEN YEARS LATER?"" CDC peer reviewed internally, meaning ‘the CDC right CDC said so. 

I gave two recent reports peer reviewed published end year. 

Not sure grade got research methods. think reassuring declared too. real world data who's vaccinated who's see caught vaccinated. turned out. Heyyyyooooooo look history numbers South Africa. spikes valleys. numbers way, way Omicron became thing. they've started climb bit, almost Omicron. 10% positivity seems pretty line country's numbers.  Fauci showed hand, red flag event. Time tell, however scientific community running cylinders right trying figure decepticon err mean omicron. 

Sit tight. It’s gonna wild wide. Dr. Sickle probably already knows here. Yep! Literally Australia past 1.5 years. F extreme, sure. covid killing people weeks months later leaving plenty time spread virus feel fine. There's linear relationship case infectiousness severity. Also, Czechia. guess Europe. GL HF  “Worst ever” COVID strain sure seems imply worse started Delta. nitpick wording, doubt lot panic soon Thursday night. Yeah, feel like we've seen real life point... Israelis also fairly quick action they'll start travel banner much faster governments also likely reverse course quickly turns there's realistic chance stopping community spread. Israeli government shown fairly logical areas well starting booster program shortly receiving data pointed towards sharp decrease vaccine effectiveness around sixth month period. That's decision likely already saved lives. super comforting freaking mind sign need log imo. week two ago Canada, people anti -vax/mask congregation died covid. pastor church called ""God's will"". Jesus Fucking Christ !! Denmark already sequencing every single positive PCR-test, spreads quickly rumored soon see high percentage confirmed Omicron-cases here. 

It currently suspected two COVID-positive tests new variant, stay tuned. Results come back tomorrow Monday. better stop driving logic. really really bad imo. 

Also, I'm still convinced northeast US's summer 'mystery' mass bird illness covid (they publicly ruled lot things, covid, hadnt named last checked.) Israel history wonky data throughout pandemic. likely cautious aren’t hoarding info. even said 2020 “act fast, act early, don’t regrets.” Well, it’s biologically similar common cold, would make sense. important thing seems historically viruses mutate frequently eventually become transmissible less virulent. it’s destiny probably like bad cold. comparison flu guess long term virulence. 

Either way, now, that’s pattern. seems always one dominant variant. American, postulating; perhaps due high medical bills, people go hospitals seek treatment recover/die home. way. Especially since Hanukkah starts tomorrow. Ah yes old CDC vs random guy 16 peer reviewed studies can’t cite lol. know. know many cases been. many identified yet. said, strictly factual sense, think Omicron deaths confirmed. could test something didn’t know existed? I’m genuinely asking, I’m sure. I’ve heard possible it’s going around already without anyone knowing yet. Yep, wanna see Vaccination card?  omicron came, almost nothing Omicrom MORONIC spelled another way first sequenced November 9th really enough time kill anyone yet. EVEN  Ah, sounds idyllic (frontline worker) fully vaccinated tho? Literally shit OG COVID especially Delta WSJ obsessed idea ""natural immunity"" better vaccine. seem publish something suggesting this, like, month. Reality, maybe. interesting. known yet, course cannot rule out. think evidence suggest do, maybe well previous variants. writing reddit, OK. arguing antivax themselves, can't offer data people reject data. able weather many waves minimal strict lockdowns compared Europe. don’t great results aren’t much worse…. recent pressure almost unvaccinated south.

I guess lot population. instance Netherlands: 517 inhabitants per square kilometer land area.| US 35 per sq. km Sure buddy. sound misguided misinformed I’m glad pro vaccine! anyone explain variant particular reason concern? don’t remember vivid reaction immediately discovery variants. E.g. delta started worrying knowing right discovery. mention iota, kappa never saw mentioned press happen new flavour variant forever. Get vax, catch covid numerous times, hope get bad. basically life Overreacting better reacting, we’ve learned hard way. Luckily it’s looking far like won’t bad, mutations scary lot people tired whole thing, it’s easy go panic mode hear information sounds scary. keep saying, makes much sense. plan next house bidet. people questioning country's choice protect people new deadly strain governments lock down. much pressure real estate food/retail businesses. cater donors. 

People gonna die You’ll get 8 next Halloween. fun like... Make sick? singing time! rich get richer surprising. 100% fatality rate isn’t cards it? Yeah well shit story came ago. They're giving free entry brothel still pay sex. anyone died this? $50 less Buffalo assert this, let assert contrary feel like it

They already did. multiple threads. ""common knowledge"" sub CDC ""hiding"" myocarditis risk. want prove anything them. want prove Reddit [redacted] disinformation sub needs banned. Yeah, read NY times article, thanks anyway! virus tons others always animals. “Gut feeling” good data gastroenterologist, epidemiologist. interesting see compliance like. dropped massively area (Kent) since summer. Busy weekend trains to/from London sometimes 25% wearing masks that. see lot people stubborn resisting. thought right probably isn’t dissimilar think “outcompete delta” thing seems fairly likely statistical artifact fact few-to-no delta cases SA time arose. Actually yeah. need apply pressure incentivized even try persuasive strategies.

They calling media well. reading 5 different articles mutation seems theory. Nobody really knows. find interesting happened one country. One high vaccination rate basically 100% population wears mask. already animals spread humans though. Hope guys ok. Everything alright ya know. enough information 2 days data completely shut borders didn’t Delta. I’m going actions here, I’m conspiracy theorist anything. I’m saying pay attention people actually say. would noticed already. one good news, there’s good news, variant, B.1.1.529, detected one particular PCR assay,” de Oliveira said news conference, meaning diagnostic labs quickly identify new BNO News started tracking map. I'm sure ""nostalgia"" right term, but. That's completely useless, virus enter country customs.  fair, changes could render less problem. things identify ""oh shit,"" could achillies heal. know something everyone else doesn’t?

No, know information exists, enough. 

I know variant first detected 3 weeks ago. know since became dominant strain South Africa spread around Africa. know 3 weeks, travel restrictions tens thousands people flew areas every corner globe. know people know look it, dozens countries starting detect exact time. know identical story played delta measure took anything prevent going global.    go Someone maybe information possible every mutation detectable PCR test/other tests?

If variant escapes tests spread wide, would think everything ok... doesn’t need special testing, that’s part you’re missing. they’re testing Covid *at all*, typical PCR tests differentiate variant.  Let’s real, it’s every country anyone give breakdown new variant reason worry variant seen? 

I know it’s ‘helluvalot’ mutations. mean laments terms? made everyone sick never would become pandemic.

I think would worked way would killed everyone would able infect people. 

But somewhat right. Reason really get much attention(not enough produce quality vaccine like permanent Pan coronavirus vaccine) imo impact enough people. serious Polio Ebola, probably would problems funding research get done. Maybe slow things let vaccine makers get update version out.

IMO new vaccines get time help unless approval process dramatically shortened. could see taking 6 8 months again, going way late head off. 

If bad might turn out, we'll deep shit within month. keep flying, see care. Agreed. Absolutely hate masking. absolutely required. Don’t care it’s unpopular opinion. actually avoid places know mask. vaccinated boosted. others concerned get boosted too. Good them. countries stupid. early indications symptoms much milder, open borders kiss South African. want outpace Delta Thanks! US great job insisting still hoax!  Still need looking it. Maybe better put would ""regional variant-dection capabilities."" Yep. It’s definitely interesting it’s different enough identified PCR testing. Thanks hard work, LEGEND. Either know they're saying (more likely) want another Delta variant catch guard. one ever distancing again. we’re told lockdown distance despite vaccinated boosted, riots. Ever since beginning, people judging others never leaving house - like act cowardice. Fuck - people choice, bodies different issues people.

Sometimes wonder lack empathy greater plague kind physical pandemic. one good news, there’s good news, variant, B.1.1.529, detected one particular PCR assay,” de Oliveira said news conference, meaning diagnostic labs quickly identify new need sequencing identified. know quote, cuckoo clock even originate Switzerland, Germany lol Except isn’t many labs doing. don’t even variant test all. Narrator: won't. Covid going disappear regardless many people vaccinated. curious, someone explain like I’m five? key points know omicron? differences original COVID? want get quick understanding what’s new, knowledgeable. vaccinated, COVID November 2020 coughed spit grocery worker telling people put mask it’s mandatory Massachusetts spiking back up. I’m bit worried could already well.  seems premature. Perhaps Israeli government watching much World War Z wonder virus going away time soon new variants like popping up. Idk cultural precedent South Africa lol Love haha. Could've two shots everyone got vaccinated beginning. 

Could've one got J&amp;J everyone got vaccinated beginning. 

Could've zero everyone locked told should.

The reason going get 11 shots people (presumably like you) bothered right thing. would look like Alpha standard PCR test (it's missing one three key genetic sequences typical PCR test), sample would flagged unusual sent sequencing, technician/scientist would realized Alpha. Hopefully works like that(as usually viruses). sadly case Delta. 

Once study says 133% deadlier original strain far state live lowest vaccination Poland. 37% vaccinated. Ppl believe vacine government give Sh....   omicron variant discovered couple days ago south africa 
Beta variant discovered earlier july south africa Scientist say weeks know worse delta, know far look good.

It took omicron less 2 weeks become dominate strain many parts South Africa, really surprising considering omicron 50 mutations, 30 spike protein alone, that's twice many spike protein mutations compared delta variant.

There also mutations enhance virus’s ability enter cells changes never seen previous variants. Look face!!! Lol Dude ever heard football league? top two leagues alone account like 500k people. Every saturday. Gathered i. Groups 75000. wouldn’t worry rugby match We’re three weeks in. COVID mortality usually 4 weeks. know soon enough. spread unprecedented. It’s apparently contagious. South America see delta surge. flew to/from Europe last month. Several people plane masks off, chin, nose exposed throughout virtually flight. 

Flight attendants asked mask wearing. even made announcement wearing mask could get banned airline. get taken aside landed? No. hung baggage claim talking phone masks completely pre-customs.

Oh, one shocked person coughing entire flight also one wearing mask right. course were. Agreed. narratives trying get early foothold. don’t enough data yet.  Updated URL: really hope someday virus mutates version doesn’t cause anosmia manifest delayed parosmia. Israel impressive public health response, making great decisions information instead waiting perfect data. turns wrong decision, inconvenienced international travelers. could difficult some, able see family difficult time, complete important business travel. Compare entire country invaluable time respond. ends serious, it'll well worth it, even slow spread week two. wish kind forward thinking public health leadership US. Pretty much Americans virus good faith risk analysis.

Nearly participating identity politics ""Good GOP"" \*has\* outraged things Fox News Talk Radio outraged about.

Not throwing tantrum vaccine recommendation doctor would threaten identity peer group membership. got 2nd shot back February appt booster tomorrow.. wondering get (I US) saw don’t work new variant Pfizer reformulate? Thanks!  ….. Christmas New Years? Honest question, people like Marty Markay getting natural immunity upwards 100x better double vaxx?

I thought previous studies showed natural immunity wasn’t anywhere close strong, last anywhere near long. 

Sure feels like either someone full shit, poor studies. Unlikely. time need hospitalization Covid likely don’t care costs (and somewhat covered pandemic). really need hospitalization would likely die home US death rate high numbers don’t bear large swaths home. lot actors/actresses look alike, either Hollywood specific type they’ve cloning people years. contradicting think lot beds. Gloves aren’t necessary, wash/sanitize hands avoid touching face. It’s transmittable surfaces anyway. get get with. 


Denmark sequence almost cases. 50% recent spike case rates, still seen omicron ago widespread. today appear. thought read new variant resistant vaccine? Anyone clear me? Fox News said so. *should* Good comment. irrational religious antivaxxers could see too. read tweet supposedly South African infectious disease doctor/official saying far caused mild symptoms. Cant verify truth information, hopefully turns accurate. China needs get better vaccines quickly. Fly vaccines tge idea getting sick frequently better generally bunk. yet another spin anti-vax crowd ""get back normal"" crowd vaccines let everyone get sick die.

Humans already amazing immune system resist diseases minimal noticeable illness. get exposed many diseases couple years fighting Covid-19 variants, going fundamentally break immune responses. did, would seen much Spanish Flu 1918. Instead, people got vaccinated, things returned normal years and, expected, common diseases suddenly run rampant. hate right like Please tell turned away (or 36-hour wait) capacity COVID patients. looks like polio came monkey. small pox unknown origin. 0% fully vaccinated still good sign Density comparisons entire US aren’t particularly accurate. include bath swaths unpopulated mountain west (and never mind Alaska).

LA county population density 2k per square mile (over 800 per square kilometer) 10m people. state New Jersey 1200 per square mile.

Most US population lives cities/suburbs density wildly different Europe. highest death rates sparsely populated states….  Apparently skipped 'nu' 'xi' 'nu' similar 'mu' naming variant 'xi' would almost certainly taken advantage sinophobes. 


It spread extremely quickly SA, recently. Obviously spreading across world, going saying everywhere weeks even months simply supported know.

Denmark sequences large proportion positive covid tests, today seen omicron. Oh shit. mean, yeah? Makes lot sense. Masks don’t disturbe Travel purpose totally bar purpose. Also everybody chooses go Bar, People use public transport get somewhere find bit shocking formula changed since original version virus

My guess would logistical nightmare switch new vaccine every variant/mutation pops every day. money.


“Pfizer BioNTech … begun clinical trials variant-specific vaccines (Alpha Delta) collect safety tolerability data provided regulators part blueprint studies event needed variant-specific vaccine."" I’m nitpicking wording. I’m literally saying words originally discussed linked article. Israel continues ridiculous reactionary COVID policies. Well don’t think booster enough time kick in. week later, horrible timing though feeling effects booster right got super sick Covid. Two weeks later feel close 100% can’t smell anything. girlfriend fully vaccinated booster she’s still sick week half.      nothing point. barrier people vaccinated barrier (hesitancy, misinformation), regardless current percentages are. special modes kinds rules!

There's also ""save world"" version, fight virus. really difficult quite realistic.

You issue lockdowns, people start breaking rules rioting. play long, real. Add complete lack self awareness assessment serious compassion deficit I’m sitting reading exchange just…*yikes*. You’re definitely wrong holy moly, dunno kept responding face *that*. understand one busts screed like absolutely shame turns still surprised. O_o 

I hope stay safe. refrain comment hope one thread. 😂  Yes good thing can’t think anything upcoming /s Innativated virus vaccines would resilient spike mutations asked know told them. Okay. fun date new variant! hope mean you. sounds horribly isolating. Nobody forcing socialize, like shouldn’t dragging everyone else introversion you. fact world leaders addressing within days us learning nervous. might nothing, pretty crazy none us knew week ago, everyone know well aware it. think even delta felt concerning. Source: trust evidence contradicts gut feeling I'm trying emphasize evidence. Sorry I'm clear. Three Pfizer shots Yes, also need holdouts get vaccinated already. Narrator: ""various places"" means Johannesburg, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique ""some time"" means 2-4 weeks. getting depressing. Would worked better pfizer modernas vaccine?

I can't imagine china better vaccine. They'll believe whatever moment allows *win*. least feel like they're winning. ... ... shall witness ... DISMEMBERMENT Excuse me, difference transmissible virulent? always asumed concepts same. I’d surprised anyone besides politicians give fuck. read title thought: lol. I'm definitely sick it. say it, though. older daughter got first shot younger can't get yet. continue cautious hopefully ok. helps fully work home, wife currently (rumor they're going back, might change things), older daughter's school requires masks.

So far we've ok, hope continue without much concern. guess we'll see. take lot walks, we've remodeled downstairs playroom room live without about. Christmas might interesting, I'm willing visit family comes that. think everyone going family's Christmas vaccinated be, so...I know. really want go, I'll take excuse suffer insanity kids, but...we see.  don't, Desantis sure import Every case 100% belongs here, he's right. Yes, hothead Pooh Bear responsible starting never ending mess. people world called Bush terrorist back day. pales, pales... think would've learned controlling spread first round  Shades “you don’t need mask you’re fully vaccinated!” like honor code was/is somehow thriving? Yeah, no. could take precautions world still catch it.

Or could lock away years die something COVID.

Just live life dude. South Africa 24.1% full vaccinated. US 60%. That's quite difference. *Deja vu* definitely is. It’s always loopholes exceptions nothing prevent spread travel Everybody re-vaccinated.

No big shit never ending circle.

It ends soon taken seriously. fact many politicians acted quick restrict flights good sign. seeing sentiment anti-vaccination circles Omicron validation stance. see makes sense.

It comes anti-vaxxers. course make sense. Flipping nothing vaccines. always last months, whole world act protect unvaccinated (and really-elderly vaccinated).

Omicron detected Tuesday causing surge Saturday. something like 10x faster previous variant. first time since winter/spring 2020, new variant spreading faster study it. know ton mutations likely lot unpredictable things, increasing case counts 5x per week. Fipping attempt buy time find more. used like recently. Last couple times week I've dinner always scanned asked ID. Actually anymore, vaccines almost everyone got vaxxed, safe. chose take vaccine made bed refuse bend shitheads. Idc variant into, done. Hail Satan! sad you’re downvoted. Funny story. took PCR test day 2 uploaded results onto website showed clearly negative, got email next day inconclusive stake test. Ok. Reorder test, wait day delivery (day 4). Retake test? Nope flight back states. 4 days walking around UK without knowing I'm positive not. 

Such shit show. could wrong, think read somewhere Omicron variant easy detect platforms one target genes knocked out. Please variant that's harmless everybody. “Should” operative word. Antivaxxers still seem vocal antivaxxers. got name wanted avoid use ""nu"" people think new virus separate COVID apparently.

They avoided use ""xi"" want make d\*ckhead China killing whole ethnic group angry. i'm saying i'm better anyone. i'm saying guys bit sensitive. everyone i've talking totally fine.  Boris johnson dropped matrix leadership smashing billion pieces labs use sequence gene. Somewhere internet find list PCR tests versus don't.  assume don’t get tetanus boosters stepping rusty nails. doubling time 3-9 days according Trevor Bedford's look genetic evolution omicron, probably means 2-6 months, one month ( 10 doublings 30 days get one patient become thousand, 60 days million ) china devastating covid outbreaks? works. Get it. Third doses increase cellular immunity, absolutely works preventing severe disease. Bs. Yeah early know, right news full virologists experts saying mutations extremely concerning, far fetched think omicron going worse delta.. is? Everything I’ve read said reason disappearance wasn’t well understood… Please show numbers/studies.

Not saying impossible. curious country pandemic started solution problem bans foreign mrna vaccines.

Don't wanna conspiracy theorist, looks like dystopian futur want world like.

If vaccine work perfectly I'm suspicious.

If comes orchestrated that, it'd open whole new era biological warfare. right, it’s possibility point. need quit reading found confirmed actually is. forget every case starts asymptomatic and/or mild. Yeah damn time! Ebola spread symptoms means know. new variant is, first time since early pandemic, spreading faster study it. number mutations red flag, 5x weekly increase cases big red flag. Beyond everything complete unknown. know could specifically picked PCR pointed out. interesting cool. point remains exactly - *you need specifically looking it* (be via sequencing specifically designed PCR test) order find it. think is. sad thing is, it’s sapping mine people *don’t* issues deal with. It’s crazy making. coronavirus, something see easily prove (and even, demonstrable, something about). post belong here. stimulus = votes me.  


Especially first round meant businesses entirely stolen legal maneuvering. Saw businesses near able get it, still hear stories richies got theirs. I’m allergic shellfish-ness r/foundtheidiot Yea reason, viruses thrive immunocompromised hosts, AIDS (not sure HIV). host unable quickly fight virus due weak immune system. virus mutates weeks go inside host.

There paper last year immunocompromised person Boston covid 5 months, time virus mutated lot  helping immunocompromised people find WFH positions and/or helping get approved disability? Anything happen anyone. need best care other. whatever reason

A median age well 30 (and often 20) perhaps? Bang point. handful problem variants. mRNA vaccines adapted stop all. inevitable bullshit stupid. imo stop ""keep lights on"" strategy update needed. course still update formula needed.

Hospital admissions 134 401 2 weeks know guy getting sources, supposedly 25% patients hospital vaccinated. 
Gauteng 31% fully vaccinated, 6% partially vaccinated. quick math, assume partial vaccination gives protection (just simply math...) end fully vaccinated 31% making around 18% hospitalizations. math right, means fully vaccinated grant around 60% protection hospitalization. 

Obviously kinda napkin math low sample size biased numbers, doubt hold up, best could moment. that. initials look like American conservative pretend news network still ahead anti-vaxxers? Rolling vaccine doses?? Sounds exhausting. I'll stick myriad craft hobbies require consumption hypersocialization. second point barely anyone South Africa vaccinated. totally agree you, we’ve learned mistakes keep happening. Fingers crossed help accelerate vaccinations, convince hold outs, hope vaccine efficacy hold mean time.  Israel though capacity terms contact tracing, surveillance, social solidarity etc pretty much anywhere outside East Asia oh lot worse 

* social distancing 
* masks requirement shops England
* masks requirement trains England 
* Nightclubs, bars, pubs, restaurants,cinema,theaters, schools, colleges, universities open
* yesterday 50k new cases 7 day average 45k 

Boris created set circumstances create disaster China's propaganda value self-interest.

Nothinf china says taken true.

It's chinese government owns media chinese government interest heart. Period.

They admit themselves. something long term. Get ready world economy tank every winter. see travel economy tank. mention majority lockdown again. Nope, omicron noticeable testing gives weird PCR result.

Germany's problem winter surge delta low (compared Western Europe) levels vaccination. I'd wager also fairly low levels naturally-acquired immunity compared neighbours (Germany quite well controlling virus now).  bother fucking hospital... PCR based primers match specific nucleic acid sequence. mutations virus accumulates, easier design primers mutation-rich region *specifically* amplify variant (and amplify non-variants). 

What means although detect PCR, can't simply detect using *existing* PCR protocols. need variant-specific assay variant-specific primers. easy cheap, that's good news. read mistakenly think normal test use going tell anyone whether variant not. I’m not. Screw that. wanna travel country infected new strain global pandemic sit ass hotel 2 weeks. trillions war, trillions supplement unpaid leave work.  Yeah, think needs option. I’m sorry you’re going this, I’m sorry others make feel like don’t matter - don’t matter much others. matter, seen. need support guys best can. goes 0 day after, got hear fear burning death passing like poor lady Las Vegas, burned death along dog.
to would brutal Delta usually around 1.0-1.5 moment restricitons countries vaccinated. idea numbers high, 10% lung transplant patients alot. Still, agree previously unvacinated patients excluded (the way ex-smokers aren't), long refuse get future. Get vaccinated aren’t already, due one, get booster. Preliminary data coming Israel showing current vaccines effective variant. Omicron I’m annoyed “natural immunity” better “republican” “booster shots better” “democrat”.

The science speaks   concern I've regarding global response pandemic. boosters, great way stay safe keep pandemic check, good news. gotten booster yet plan get soon, tbh mind even need boosters regularly rest life. However, I'm also seeing ways mean bad news global level.

Before vaccines even out, knew distributing less-developed countries would logistical nightmare. turns need take boosters regularly keep pandemic control, mean even bigger logistical nightmare less developed countries need distribute vaccines once, distribute boosters regularly. can't get regular boosters turn can't keep pandemic control, hurts us all, *global* pandemic. Additionally, given anti-vax sentiment places like US, hard enough get people even take dose 1. that's already hard enough, imagine it'll harder get people take subsequent doses.

I seen issues discussed much, concern mind ever since boosters announced. good boosters safe, fear need boosters, gonna even harder keep pandemic control globally. anyone else concerns, overpessimistic? really hope I'm wrong bad I'm imagining be. can’t UK? refuse entry anyone isn’t resident… Even 90%+ vaccination rates US, means squat 7 billion people vaccinated 30% clip  completely contradicts original claim adults flight vaccinated. one take anything read Reddit comments face value. it’s worse thought (I said scratching beard white lab coat) find hard time good news posts I’m sure they’re good news not.   

Any given group 30 people test positive going mostly mild symptoms.   It’s one 20 ends serious trouble....  typically people less healthy older.  problem Covid always infectiousness makes one 20 huge number hits millions people.

So 5 30 people healthy enough travel young enough travel might best basis making conclusions. 

So guess it’s good don’t see extreme illness big change there.   sounding minimum similar types Covid.

But guess I’m ready make conclusions whether it’s milder see hundred thousand people  dare sound mee variants future? really sad, they’re good thing humanity yet they’re punished   Actually likely. Viruses high mortality rate aggressive symptoms can’t spread well mild symptoms.

If you’re stuck bed hospital, can’t walk around cough people. Meaning you’ll spread less.

If virus highly transmissible causes minor coughing sneezing. You’re less likely stay home, likely walk around infect others. Part might demographics. we're seeing mostly young people catching virus (due likely social less cautious older age groups) going see younger people admitted hospital, even direct risk changed. said that, may hopes variant significantly less severe, could optimistic. guess we'll wait see. Puts different spin happens go Baskin-Robbins.

Vanilla: ""I want stodgy older guy."" Older people got vaccinated, missing. leads higher percentage patients younger. Saving lives bad. -You

235 dead Americans per 100,000 covid alone. took numbers applied rate China (China densely populated it'd tried US's plan), would 3.3 million dead. 

Instead less 5,000 confirmed covid deaths China, less 100,000 cases. guess freedom die get long covid. article states one particular hospital 65% patients unvaccinated. However, since 27% South Africa fully vaccinated, information particularly helpful regards Omicron may respond vaccines. Exactly. already natural immunity, understand. you’re allergic components. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Lamar Burgess  mean exactly comment said, then?

At point, getting vaccinated truly meaningful thing one help others. Fully vaccinated people wearing masks prudent, going make much impact far spread goes. Masking drop bucket compared vaccination. 

The unvaxxed need fend point. Whether choose remain unvaxxed not. community longer responsible *can't* be.

You realize many people still financially ruined? 

You realize many people thisclose blowing brains able pay bills?

Yeah, 3-4 month lockdown would awesome. I’ll survive variant, live poverty rest life wish dead. doctor discovered omicron said cases “extremely mild”. combined fact contagious good news covid essentially become common cold. Yes, saw too. red, purple (especially related immune response), quite don’t know.

When concerning mutations cause new strain move quickly population, sometimes many neutral ones tag along ride. useful mutations, really effective mutations nearby swept everything else it.

Not saying that’s case. mutations aren’t bad - bad studied determine bad. Dude, **I lived there.** conveniently leaving *""or quarantine hotel""* part, also said option. prefecture, staying hospital *was* option. Japan =/= Tokyo. weren’t, person doesn’t know. Or, worse, India. Sounds like great way sell vaccines is, course, anecdotal, nonetheless good news. Good news hopeflly remain good. Lol third fourth person ask favor list weird one wanted it, got cookies though  Apologies, correct. asked friends confirmed well. mean took growth hormone injections make sure air bubbles etc.   would assume yes. testing see *how much* spread where. spread. 

Viruses cluster. That's works. Vaccine science advanced design one days. still takes significant time test apparently even longer FDA CDC look data approve use.

When Pfizer Moderna say respond three months so, include approval? like Thanos, “I inevitable” No. Governor state said won’t require masks. Even require them, businesses refused enforce them. us diligently wore masks work every day tried right think still ended getting Covid giving entire family, others refused cooperate. really, would cooperate? mandates never enforced. I’m wondering thing. got doses Moderna spring got COVID Halloween. I’m happy get booster makes sense, I’m hard time believing would help much soon infection. 

Like sure, might produce antibodies, already enough make functionally immune COVID months. “More” isn’t “better” case, right? What’s point?  That’s waiting new 3rd booster, going take outdated vaccine. Man, high tolerance say ""not extremely severe"" ""constantly fatigued, bad brain fog, muscle aches, cough won’t go away, heart palpitations"", would go completely crazy things going.

They first observe this, first vaccine population high first close borders variant came out

It's easier close borders countries, land borders enemies frenemies, closing borders less burden  know either. Probably misread number people. Let's hope becomes HCoV-OC43, virus think responsible 1889 Russian ""Flu"" mutated less harmful version. HCoV-OC43 one mild common cold coronaviruses.   pretty much 90 percent people get vaccinated. people stupid get would representative all. Probably half people flying Netherlands SA came Netherlands return trip. international travelers probably much likely vaccinated average SA citizen. Also wealthy average.  lot people got type 1 (used called juvenile diabetes) battling viral infection, enteroviruses studied possible link well. got T1 H1N1. known, ask type 1 group many people link sick getting T1 diagnosis. What's known people diagnosed Covid type something different. 

For people prone developing type 2, perhaps Covid pushed diagnosis along that's conjecture. T1 autoimmune disease body attacks beta cells, seems happening Covid well. T2 seem stronger genetic link 85% cases inked diet/lifestyle 15% getting T2 normal weight, linked autoimmune attack beta cell die (their beta cells die decades T2 managing it).

Why prone possible severe outcomes? ill, blood glucose levels raise significantly despite best efforts may come down. bg high healing difficult got closed loop. Can't fight virus body bringing bg levels. Can't lower bg levels sick. T1 Covid good match there's enough research yet specifically T1 Covid outcomes researchers lump types together cannot get clear picture. anecdotally, people normal near normal A1C's happen T1 seem fare general population. one's A1C already high, may harder time fighting Covid. I've seen uptick people joining type 1 groups Covid, anecdotal, i'm researcher. Shhh, need fear explain market crash Monday. It’s way small sample, time complacent, considering fast spread much worse delta variant, going get really bad, US hospitals already filled medical workers already overburdened. need start lockdowns restrictions now. better looking Israeli data want see runs highly vaccinated population. Israel high mRNA vaccination rate definition ""fully vaccinated"" includes booster last shot less 5 months ago. South Africa uses mixture Pfizer J&amp;J much lower vaccination rate general. Doesn’t Israel like 4 cases discovered last couple days. I’m sure basing of, though hope right Australia said two cases. Freddy Kruger?! Freddy get Fingered?! Information likely withheld anything conclusive yet regards variant I'd like think governments trying get smarter messaging.

Also think they're trying come stronger given timing variant right near holidays we'll likely see explosion cases. Getting really sick persecution complex everyone seems get people try protect themselves. … “Air Travel” UK banned last year. last long found world, point. buy time temporary I'm sure. question seemed something along lines of, *If someone gets Omicron get Delta?*

The answer lies data. transmissible variants lead immunity thats **temporary** long enough squash less transmissible variants.

So, yes, immune variants least long enough squashed out.

Now, asking something else? Obviously everyone two brain cells rub together knows there’s nothing like permanent immunity variants… can't help feel like that's worse scenario people make be. can't imagine annual covid shot uptake gonna enough keep things control without additional public health measures essentially means permanent state capacity limits, masking, vaccine passports etc.  Punished? asked receive vaccines 4 days think need reminded this.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  long enough timeline people comfortable vaccines also ones survive. Nah that's normal. Booster smaller dose. Omicron kind alternative vaccine?

It's ideal Omicron turns asymptomatic v low fatality rates could potentially provide protection deadlier strains? fine. people questioning account things simply came SA would apparently incentivized cover things up. Everyone understands handful patients evidence. idea updating vaccines kind failure needs stop. Vaccines tool tools improved. one improved months ago. Yeah need work more. left Facebook years ago seeing dumb stuff hurting mental health, that’s someone fortunate never suffer depression anxiety typically. helped lot. seeing Reddit past years. Almost article tons people comments saying definitively super bad news, mark words make things way worse, on. 

I remember nightmare back around 2016 think Russia attacking US, jets flying house, time Russia lot close flybys planes near Alaska (they may still be, Reddit story time), constant doom sayers obviously got me. 

Anyway, point is, you’re right algorithms even normal people sometimes quick go worst case may sound like know stuff, every instance far they’ve wrong. do, delta variant immune escape scare well yet didn’t this. really thinking they’re holding back order minimize panic Ofcourse, someone one thing time need , never change spike protines. matter much people retweet one researcher. says little change spike protines. Really different, vaccinated individuals US countries using vaccines. dangerous like viruses, mutation less deadly bur spreads faster. un vaccinated individuals worry ? Yes thier problem. never mutation magically changes spike protines enough even make vaccines ineffective percentage. like 1000 variations track give ominous names. evidence see, speculations made fearmongering. Show less deadly variation little know effects vaccinated individuals. thought Nu scary new one watch. That's fine issue - posts suggesting biased political reasons / avoid travel bans cover severity posts quotes. worse that? 13% positivity rate population (A) produced negative test prior couple days could get plane (B) affluent average (got figure folks flying SA Netherlands skews toward upper middle class average) meaning likely access vaccines, good masks, social distancing measures. 

I agree. hope something confounding it. 20,000 *official* COVID deaths young people 39 years old. people age bracket much likely survive develop severe case, it’s fair state COVID (now especially Delta) made lot young adults severely ill. 

The narrative young adults nothing worry COVID caused lot harm throughout pandemic. past week, 20 something coworker wife, unvaccinated, came work two days hiding symptoms illness. end result this? wife four coworkers COVID positive, two managers place employment well. One managers (woman, mid upper 30’s ill breathing difficulties, double vaccinated boosted). 

The behavior young people pandemic recklessly endanger importantly others one big driving forces behind disaster. 

It’s really sickening. words I’d like say little brat selfishly got wife sick immature selfish right thing… unfortunate. That's WHO's decision named wise one. least short term stigma long lasting impact. Yeah, said moving towards yet. guess limited understanding things. (French citizen here, nearly 88% two-dose coverage is, something guess. Boosters also considered they're made available category I'll take 'em.)  experts tell travel bans nothing set virus got in! That's mostly correct. However, different flu varients, different strains. flu virus segmented genome (only handful viruses like that) every copy contains genetic material make every strain (different H N surface protein configurations). take much undergo genetic drift switch surface proteins already genetic coding go so. covid virus genetic material make every covid variant, thus relies mutation genetic drift. said IF. I’m reading anything. know someone lives 2 miles small town indiana. fell love online fly south Africa couple weeks ago get married. returned 4 days ago. new variant spread extremely rapidly cause mild symptoms, could replace Delta net good thing? strange news — surely it’s settle fears (“theoretically, would possible targeted vaccine two months discovery new variant “) something that’s actively worked way takes away development successful Delta targeted booster… lucky avoid Corona Original Corona Delta far. Let's hope cross path! No, unfair thing double standard. positive cases confirmed day Belgium, Hong Kong Israel one even talks countries nobody banning countries. world reacting way towards every country, nobody would complain unfortunately, political decision discrimination towards Africa. still positive cases coming different countries Europe UK, Netherlands, Germany, etc. banned anywhere, they? first time happening, thing happened Delta variant. main stream media represented ""South African variant"" cases low South Africa period still, positive case numbers low S. Africa months, especially compare European countries. variant discovered Africa mean originated here. actually shows good African scientists are. world thank unfortunately, that's happening right now. peak season tourism Africa decision huge negative impact economy.  cousin’s wife, 40s health concerns, caught Covid April 2020. spent weeks hospital, three weeks ventilator, time rehab. took year able work full time still isn’t physically back getting sick. acquaintance mine, who’s mid 50s, got it. spent time hospital BiPap. never go ventilator what’s probably permanent lung damage, use oxygen home, longer work nurse.  else BBC propose? dangerous virus discovered country get rewarded free travel everywhere, order encourage countries look viruses? Confusing. Aren’t already ? Vegas ? Pharmacy administering vaccines, state’s dime. claim it’s enough time say it’s fear mongering, yet it’s enough time say fear mongering.

The simple fact don’t understand fucking stupid assume this, illustrates makes fucking sense you.  Yes. Sadly may also true. time tell. Shut kept borders closed....but know... capitalism. turned plane back around Triple double dosed? Got booster yesterday. Woke 5 feeling like poo. Took couple Tylenol PM crashed again. 15 minute window wakefulness, thought, “why people focused survival rate? I’d take vaccine feel like days”

Woke sweaty sheets, feel pretty good now. definitely want virus. course got booster hearing MAY need another one new variant (not yet confirmed) going upset, annoyed excited. We're dealing pandemic comes us. booster already showing significant increase antibodies compared first 2 doses. correct annual seasonal concern, yet. time science tell. context, originally talked fictional situation. Swapping back reality make sense. respond pseudo joke based fiction reality, going to, use term ""high score""?  Air passengers? flights grounded point?    That's news article says southern (not capitalized) Africa (continent), lists specifically 9 countries (including limited South Africa) article itself.

I'm sorry education issue, actually read article issue. less pertinent details news story always bottom paragraphs. current vaccine seems working Israel SA, get ready Omicron fine, push unless actually needed.  anything feel like it’s going decrease. amount disinformation/misinformation increased anti-vaxx campaigns strong ever. Keep thinking that, bro. delusional. I'm done here. Peace. getting from? Pfizer said months ago produce 4 billion vaccines 2022. Everyone planet could die tomorrow stock market would hit record high within month. Definitely agree. actually practicing felt great prior variant news. Now, U.S. National Science Foundation-funded scientists Yale School Public Health University North Carolina Charlotte answer: Strong protection following natural infection short-lived. 
 
""Reinfection reasonably happen three months less,"" said Jeffrey Townsend Yale, study's lead author. ""Therefore, naturally infected get vaccinated. Previous infection alone offer little long-term protection subsequent participants 5 times likely COVID-19 unvaccinated prior true. That’s we’ve needed people think they’re young healthy vaccinate too. I’m immunocompromised I’ve recognized long time it’s bodies like mine produce variants, unvaccinated. unvaccinated super dangerous could kill also infection could use body produce variants. Us sick people known everyone decided we’d die acceptable. they’ve realized could kill them, suddenly show slightest bit concern could vaccinating protect others whole time. [just like Spain flu going around 1918 originated Kansas, USA Gabe credit pandemic Spain, unfortunately!  interesting Yes, consider overall population still sit around 60% vaccinated. Many smart people indicated need closer 90-95% population vaccinated make true difference. 

Honestly feels like we’re going stuck pandemic forever. Article quotes ""the remarkable thing MRNA vaccines, Moderna platform move fast"" least initial breakthroughs MRNA vaccines wait year variant vaccines. course, did, another variant may mutated then. Hope current vaccines still effective. much transmissible would SARS-COV-2 if, instead killing 1 200 transmission killed 1 2000 transmission.

It would 0.45% infectious. know nothing variant new boogeyman news gets another thousand articles.

Is dangerous? already? vaccines work? need lock down? make new vaccine one? close borders? Bonus points scientists don’t know say “maybe” “it’s possible” Reporters love words.

Reporting covid joke. “The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) carrying targeted testing individual visited likely infectious. said Westminster central London.”

I hope she/he wearing mask Ask CIA provide satellite photos evidence. happy oblige. lot countries relaxed requirements double vaccinated. South Africa not, apply destinations policies. 
So many countries essentially say fly regardless status double vaxxed need test arrive. 

And tourists almost always loads exposure events. 🤣🤣🤣 Thanks corrections, seems flu slippier beast. people, many people. state still 50% fully vaccinated. Depends entirely mortality breakthrough cases. nearly zero (most probable outcome) possibility lockdown countries.   However everyone unvaccinated 60 Moscow must stay home spring Israel they're putting idiocy using unproven things like Ivermectin like idiots country doing. think bad? wait pie jokes next edition… people flying Amsterdam staying, like connecting flight? Says lot crappy US disease surveillance haven’t found yet. number cases increasing too. Probably related variant. Delta severe higher reproduction Correct. Far early draw conclusions yet severity infection, rate infection, immune escape. don’t know yet. two weeks likely definitive answers. Yeah I’ve gotten 3. suppose I’m bothered that, maybe it’s 2 kids: 2 years old 6.5 months old. I’m thick making sure get vaccines timely manner… means vaccines every 3 months baby. Babies get shots every 3 months basically first year half life. anyone mad (excluding anti-vaxxers)? Anytime get primary series vaccine takes one shot, covid vaccine different. Going forward, get transmission level huge mutations aren’t likely, perhaps need annual boosters. maybe every years. since we’re still pandemic phase don’t know. 

It’s cluster fuck. can’t convince enough people get first shots, boosters aren’t really going solve problem. But, us want protected via vaccines getting boosters every 6 months isn’t sustainable (for many). idea why? Really? It’s fairly simple understand people charge want scaremonger. Power control  Get third dose. Flu mutates far rapidly Covid, new strains every year. case. better. country challenges world largely said meh fuck AIDS isnt problem us. resources get everyone ART. I’ll chip someone country year recently moved Beijing.

In terms everyday life, effects minimal. previous city lived show green health code taking public transport entering shopping malls, etc. Beijing it’s complete opposite scan malls, etc. walk subway like it’s nobody’s business.

Other traveling Beijing outbreak pain ass requires PCR test. Traveling elsewhere outbreak (most time) pretty smooth. foreigner get full COVID theatre treatment separate lane arriving another city, meant record passport details etc.

I’m sure make infection numbers. Since come China never met anyone local COVID friends/relatives it. inclined believe numbers largely true, much relied comes asymptomatic carriers.

What realize state much deeper control measures anywhere else world, they’ve able wield advantage comes battling virus.

Case point, weeks ago partner feeling sniffly ordered counter drugs delivered home (side note: get anything delivered home China, time day night). Two days later got phone call local health authority asking whether run fever confirming address employment details. Imagine getting paracetamol govt calling check you. That’s exactly happens everyday.

As side note, might surprised hear obligation get vaccinated. I’ve yet get first dose it’s never issue even though work education. scheduled get first jab two weeks, though since seems increasingly unlikely I’ll able get anything locally-produced vaccine. Extreme chest pain. went ER bunch tests found way There’s still concern getting since don’t know long term effects getting are. There’s least evidence neuroscience it’s causing forms brain damage people losing sense smell. people regain groups people haven’t doctors think never will.

Are fucking serious?

We wouldn’t even talking China hadn’t fucked first place. sure treatments, Fosun Pharma China acquired license produce BioNTech/Pfizer’s vaccine locally year ago.

I get 4th dose means save people start going normalcy again. time, stick summary / need know articles comes developing stories like one. [Such one 

There's countless reports moment, lot speculation, useful information us usually summarized sentences. see benefit trying ""stay informed"" since there's virtually nothing articles would affect us moment.

More important information come eventually, really need follow live feed find third case identified UK bit earlier today? really... depends well immune system recognizes Omicron vs. covid variants. enough differences Omicron, immune system might recognize Omicron “covid”, therefore won’t react way infected different variant.

Until Omicron, variants similar enough immune system respond appropriately regardless variant came contact with. Omicron ~50 mutations compared variants, ~30 spike protein, mRNA vaccines use train immune system. there’s possibility exposure Omicron won’t result immune response exposed variants. 

From we’ve seen far (which little): Omicron far contagious. could due mutations causing increased infectivity, immune systems recognizing Omicron covid, both.

If vaccinated people milder symptoms compared unvaccinated people, we’ll know vaccines still working. vaccines still working, exposure Omicron train immune system protect covid variants. haven’t enough cases studies yet know play out. submission removed either repost, clickbait low quality submission.

It never got less deadly. European population got filtered preceding 3000 years. Hopefully, variant inevitably mutate though, seems like won’t end. quickly spreading (Graph showing you)

That graph would much nicer could somehow include number cases too. 0-80% much impressive 500 Delta vs 5 Delta  Please provide links specifically showing talking about. 

It opinion. demonstrable fact true. Stop typing share links quiet. Y’all go work country cares healthcare workers prioritizes getting us shitty debacle. US clearly intention put foot enforce things get us faster. I'm northeast valley - Sunland-Tujunga/Sun Valley. got hit hard last winter people remember, guess. No. article linked says 40% adults vaccinated.  South Africans adults. babies virus? people selfish. summarize:

• hasn’t enough time say *isn’t* fear mongering.
• enough time say *is* fear mongering.
• According you, I’m saying can’t comment disagree clearly pointed it’s waste time argue people topic topic point sub. (This equivalent going anime sub pointing anime sucks. don’t pointless, even though every right to).
• You’ve yet make point support argument.

Is gist? Ah government proven forthcoming earnest activities past right. mention conduct first covid outbreak. Yeah I'd really pass benefit doubt current reported cases. Google image search ""U Ohio game crowd"" figures really make sense. many people care anymore there, state's mess.  Yes. honestly, really contagious, avoid everywhere? don’t think so.   said ""serious case""? (preface saying knew would never eliminated, like Ebola plague, also knew long time we'd safe sanitary mask up.) know, 2 years pandemic coming top another wave news another variant concern? reading statement post, said Fauci (which middle watching Face Nation interview rn) depressing fuck. 

and I'm sure plenty people depressed really optimistic I've able optimistic like I've extremely depressed throughout pandemic reading depressing makes wonder many people going say fuck either a) become suicidal what's fucking point living b) live like pandemic precautions masks die anyway infect people process. Social credit +1! need two weeks, Delta still worse variant…but spreads faster..? phrase ""living virus"" means different things different people, however fauci's 10k cases reached pretty harsh measures whoch societal political implement America, given variant spread waning vaccine immunity  guess like vaccines 70% treated (if that’s case) sufficient. Here’s article found Bloomberg basically predicting variant.[HIV epidemic stymies South Africa’s COVID  Unsub news world news subreddits! awhile nice living obliviously awhile. resubbed recently friends talking current events figure things get overwhelming know handle it. 

Bury head sand lol.  want get US, fly another country Americas looser restrictions.

I think confused works like forgot passports -- passport fly Mexico SA, shows via stamps reporting, like VISA.

Now someone flying Mexico illegally crossing Rio Grande entirely possible, think agree incredibly unlikely. one everyone tries that, obviously won't, would still slowed things intended. Turns vaccine created mutations nearly 99% ineffective. Imagine lied every step way evil fucks yet still trust best interest heart lmao. I'm fully vaccinated getting booster. think I'm antivaxx go eat brothers asshole. Fool once... wont fooled - Bush. Macadamia Nuts 'n Cream: “It’s never same” work niche field relatively low demand also relatively low people qualified. trade chance remote. mean, might cause trouble future. Assuming want keep specific work, could hard find new position geographic area. could set back career progression. hand, lot transferable skills, maybe moving niche anyways. Hard say.  


I already got take 2020 off. we'll see. afford it. means we'll make sacrifices later. Like might deciding grad school me. need include testing order see arrived United States. I've scheduled Moderna Booster shot self Brother 25 year old Father didn’t decide call coronavirus that’s you’re saying. Coronavirus really category viruses COVID belongs to. Somehow name stuck instead actual name disease.  study Cleveland Clinic tracked cases healthcare workers either vaccinated previously COVID-19 found rate reinfection essentially vaccinated.

I question. simply providing sources opposite claims quote. Covid 2: Omicron Boogaloo didn’t decide call coronavirus that’s you’re saying. Coronavirus really category viruses COVID belongs to. Somehow name stuck instead actual name disease. kind tests take prior arrival..how long prior arrival..many factors here.  arguments there! bothers me, “I think people saw coming”. No, people didn’t see coming. People made claims called crazy. Anyone spoke things ignored, made fun of, cancelled completely. Okay, doctor learned live choice. Delta could contained, neither this. hubris ever think could maintain zero cases.  Mine healthcare related. I’m also curious, haven’t heard it’s better get 3rd shot type mix up? need TWIV emergency episode please..... Great see misinformation rejected immediately can't name virus world leader.  Closing didn’t keep Delta out. considering major passages Australia via Hong Kong, Dubai Singapore—even border closures—it bound happen. share sources? Pretty curious findings. People died Spanish flu quickly, often within 3 days, makes sense less deadly mutations persisted. Covid isn’t like that, people quite contagious symptom onset. 

I’m also concerned sheer volume hosts available (8 billion) opposed maybe 1 billion century ago. gives virus eightfold opportunity persist mutate. Hopefully vaccination reduce number, much, I’m sure. Well considering anti vaxxers love using study Israel claiming natural immunity better vaccination reason get vaccinated I'm sure take information seriously True, unfortunately would rather ethically questionable rainbow six whole situation. watching Mich Ohio St game yesterday thinking ""aren't big issues COVID there?"" field end game shoulder shoulder. They've still got Delta SA. Plus vaccine rate shockingly low. Think like 28% least 1 dose last time checked. know , I’m sure virus already called Xi virus would rename heartbeat no--the omicron mutations make akin vampires enter country invite it. Definitely respecting borders sovereignty otherwise world needs stop shutting panicking sake voluntarily unvaccinated.  basically none freak matters? prediction, unvaxxed, fucked. nice day. what? Came lab. Go Harvest restaurant across street. don’t even get back car.  However, like good red blooded Americans, I’m sure would get back car go across street. late what?

- keep contained African continent? Well, never really question. It’s identified elsewhere, essentially start.

- minimize travel current hot zones, thereby limit chance accelerated seeding parts word? Yes, effective (for now). measures harsh, buying governments, healthcare systems public extra days prepare. difference Xi one many possible monikers whereas “corona” literally type virus was. well Taiwan rang bell, one cared... even WHO.  lol Likely far 5M dead Covid.

The Economist puts like 17M Severe deaths Palestinian children though...not due covid  would take booster. probably help anyway, plus new vaccin could take much longer, new variant show 3 months. hard predict, I'd go something right proven help delta (so pretty good chance also help one). used political tool existence, danger, vaccinations politicized like US really small miracle manage cram many mind-controlly chips tiny vial serum ^^\s Life expectancy tell many elderly is. Median age Israel 30.5 US 38.1 higher % US 65+. 5 million official figure, real one likely double more. 
Plenty countries reported deaths, like India many deaths gone unreported, Russia many deaths attributes covid been. mention many people died without even tested, issue common developing countries.
And 18 million figure Spanish flu gave lowest possible figure. agree around twice that, three times.
But total world population 4 times 1918. Present, then. Republican genes getting harder harder pass Finally, makes sense me. Thank you. Gottleib's Thoughts Omicron:

""When comes travel restrictions South Africa nations, unfortunately, think punitive measures way harsh. US buy us two weeks time slow spread here.""

""While official reported cases, Omicron almost definitely US already.""

""For time being, would recommend using level precautions average person using now. Whatever comfortable with.""

""It's important note South Africa, Biden banned travel 8 countries. 5 8 countries recently told Pfizer stop delivering doses, stockpile full nobody taking them. question distributing certain areas, question hesitancy.""

""The two big unanswered questions determine trajectory US are, protected Omicron previously infected Delta, gotten 3 doses vaccine, two original plus booster, protect Omicron. say latter is, talking vaccine workers, degree confidence can't give exact percentage now, believe Booster offer FAIR amount protection Omicron.""

""Ultimately, level protection prior infection boosters going determine future numbers US. protection rate one high, got blockade another epidemic wave. wait numbers."" skipped letter Xi name new variant, “the word common name” didn’t care Corona common surname Spain, Italy Latin America. called “guidelines” pure BS. 
My surname Corona living English speaking country I’ve mocked constantly last year slap face me. religion. There's this: Deuteronomy 30:19: ""I call heaven earth record day you, set life death, blessing cursing: therefore choose life, thou thy seed may live.""

Seems like lot people ignoring religious edict choosing death. Yeah really don’t enough evidence. healthy individuals traveling. nothing clean mess Saying travel bans don’t work saying vaccines don’t work don’t stop 100% cases. idea slow spread certain high risk areas cut exponential growth early on. won’t prevent coming eventually buys time respond. personal experience, partner COVID. Rapid test caught mine. PCR tested positive me. tested negative PCR 2 days testing positive. We're fully vaccinated. 

Rapid tests always reliable catching positives.  But… but… but… media going can’t put people fear!?!? else going drive traffic websites get revenue? Great news Older people funds travel internationally. mom 89 year old grandma spent 3 weeks Bosnia Croatia. They’re going back Greece February. mom dad going Prague Austria (if they’re allowed in) two weeks. Egypt Africa, North Africa. You’re forgetting don’t actually know anything mindlessly regurgitating propaganda fed you. I'd get booster again, even told symptoms would 10x were.  Yeah, took 2020 (no unemployment payments unfortunately) wife WFH. together #1. #2 plan home work, working outside.  


Seems fair, want chance 100% present. quit, could pick part time WFH jump Obamacare. year two one us could go back fulltime.  


I already feel like I'm missing #2, course miss #1 too. four days row holiday wonderful. Honestly considering quitting staying home things turn around soon. really wife's call. savings stem higher paychecks last years, bought house. say, good 50 grand bank? long keep food, shelter medicine payments, bother retirement savings? world gonna unrecognizable 30 year anyways. ""South Africa shuts outgoing air traffic protect nations newly discovered variant""

Just trying imagine world where, instead whining right thing forced upon them, people would themselves. It’s complicated. assume reaction may different, depending region. However, saying it’s “punishment” counterproductive. We’re together quick actions taken, won’t always perfect equitable. pandemic.  positivity rate shot week stuck 9% day past three days. really feel it’s good given spread hasn’t exploded. say it’s potentially bad! Pass left hand side never severe case covid unvaccinated Still glad hear that. previously healthy mid-30's person, I'm still dealing long covid 21 months initial infection wildtype :/ 

I hope vaccine protects healthy young people going deal nearly two years. soon know definitely prefer good anecdotal data bad. hoping news stays good $35 USD. bad, might make worthwhile staffing/overhead/paperwork.
For contrast, pharmacies Ontario paid $13.00/shot pharmacists receive none. Paperwork brutal. typically get flu shot annually. 

The side effects intense second dose covid vaccine I, one, get covid vaccine annually. even sure get third dose booster. 

103 degree fever 72 hours, dizziness, extreme body aches fatigue. like voluntarily injecting bad case flu. exactly would net positive sure

NO. I‘m sorry true every case. Sure, could possibility. covid shown us less deadly transmissible lead much higher casualties. Compare Ebola (50% case fatality rate) H5N1 (54% case fatality rate) example, much harder time spreading claimed far less lives covid. 

Whether better worse depend highly specifics, i.e. things like transmissibility, incubation time mortality rates. simply early know yet. 

There reports omicron variant seems cause milder illness, claims suffer huge selection bias. example, South Africa‘s population young, travelers vaccinated twice even three times. addition, people bad cases take approximately 2-3 weeks worsen point go hospital. It‘s lagging indicator. top that, know nothing potential long-covid effects yet. use almost everyone survives return left crippled. 

I want fearmonger, assume worst obviously hoping best. way around, may end falling flat faces. 

To summarize, let‘s wait actual data omicron trickle in. say certainty wether it‘s going «net positive» not. McDonalds gonna sell new cheese burger next year. surprise. 1 product exists per company- stock price like computer virus. program (file) virus scanners detect it. really know does. need run multiple computers, reverse engineer it, etc.

If sample virus read (DNA) code. code tell sick people get it. make guesses. wonder though bias severely infected patients either pre-diabetic undiagnosed diabetic, considering obesity major risk factor severe COVID type 2 diabetes. Insurance companies: “Write down! Write down!”  ❤️ how's general? what's horizon, career-wise? understanding virus infectious protein better able attach receptor, less. I've never heard job requires flu short work unless healthcare related. No, get booster scheduled. That’s got extremely small margin people. I’ve never heard that. Im south 50% residents unvaxxed I’m lockdowns/restrictions hospitals start become overrun again. Last time drive refrigeration trucks morgue overrun. want virus pass get back normal life, even want others stay alive safe. It’s tragic demoralizing living place half population thinks it’s “common flu” reality it’s killing record number people many rapid tests would say enough sure covid? 

Last sunday hung friend boyfriend, house. We're vaccinated see often enough. stuffy nose, nothing else, brushed off. monday evening feeling weird took rapid test turned positive, took PCR positive also. 

Since we've seeing anyone, wednesday thursday till now, bf rapid test every day. bought several brands, spit nasal swab tests. Thing is, I've coughing since thursday - constantly, I'll get coughing fit couple times day. Still, tests negative. PCR pretty expensive I'm money. 4-5 negative home tests reliable enough? — Worried scientists South Africa scrambling combat lightning spread across country new highly transmissible omicron COVID-19 variant world grapples emergence.
In space two weeks, omicron variant sent South Africa period low transmission rapid growth new confirmed cases. country’s numbers still relatively low, 2,828 new confirmed cases recorded Friday, omicron’s speed infecting young South Africans alarmed health professionals.


“We’re seeing marked change demographic profile patients COVID-19,” Rudo Mathivha, head intensive care unit Soweto’s Baragwanath Hospital, told online press briefing.
“Young people, 20s late 30s, coming moderate severe disease, needing intensive care. 65% vaccinated rest half-vaccinated,” said Mathivha. “I’m worried numbers go up, public health care facilities become overwhelmed.”


She said urgent preparations needed enable public hospitals cope potential large influx patients needing intensive care.
“We know new variant,” said Mathivha. “The worst case scenario hits us like delta … need critical care beds ready.”


What looked like cluster infection among university students Pretoria ballooned hundreds new cases thousands, first capital city nearby Johannesburg, South Africa’s largest city.
Studying surge, scientists identified new variant diagnostic tests indicate likely responsible many 90% new cases, according South Africa’s health officials. Early studies show reproduction rate 2 — meaning every person infected likely spread two people.


The new variant high number mutations appear make transmissible help evade immune responses. World Health Organization looked data Friday named variant omicron, system using Greek letters, calling highly transmissible variant concern.


“It’s huge concern. terribly concerned virus,” Professor Willem Hanekom, director Africa Health Research Institute, told Associated Press.
“This variant mostly Gauteng province, Johannesburg area South Africa. we’ve got clues diagnostic tests … suggest variant already South Africa,” said Hanekom, also co-chair South African COVID Variant Research Consortium.
“The scientific reaction within South Africa need learn much soon possible. know precious little,” said. “For example, know virulent virus is, means bad disease causes?”


A key factor vaccination. new variant appears spreading quickly among unvaccinated. Currently, 40% adult South Africans vaccinated, number much lower among 20 40-year-old age group.
South Africa nearly 20 million doses vaccines — made Pfizer Johnson &amp; Johnson — numbers people getting vaccines 120,000 per day, far government’s target 300,000 per day.
As scientists try learn omicron, people South Africa take measures protect it, said Hanekom.


“This unique opportunity. There’s still time people get vaccinated go get vaccine, provide protection, believe, infection, especially protection severe infection, severe disease death,” said. “So would call people vaccinate can.” 80% American adults least one shot. many die hard antivaxxers sounds like, whine loudly. idea new variant dangerous current vaccines work it. don’t get VG links accepted here, though tabloid reliable comes corona news. weird blaming China Covid spreading hafl US thinks masks work vaccines Satan...... necessarily negative. Tests required fly SA vaxxed fouchi? Many need confirmation, troops instance. double vaxxed. SA government requires testing flying in, applies destinations policies flying out. ask netherlands/uk require it. Let's hopeful soon know.

Seems contagious delta terms vaccine escape mortality known.

Not sure it'll go Omicron, high vaccinations play time.  Nice would be, think much time wasted someone drive house house, compared line people filing getting shots one another.  empirical data based what’s reported far, (afaik) vaccinated cases asymptomatic Yes, fake according antivaxxers. haven’t gotten shot yet, would change mind? really hope future variant becomes deadly MERS was.

Can ask source?

Because major vaccine companies said study new strain find it.

Can ask source?can sure short time. wouldnt suprised??? helloo?? things completely control shred hope containment. us already. fact know lot people exactly big fans Israeli government, I'm probably one too.

However take hat acknowledge see clearly shit together certainly world leaders helping beat virus. 

This probably first article I've seen subject i'd probably believe basis fact. True. Maybe ""Get vaccinated get less sick"" bit purpose, determination courage, ""plop"", goes needle, press plunger pull (now try one hand - that's supposing panic around needles). No, difficult. simple. probably going hurt... TWO years since pandemic began yet fact still hard time tell people common sense... don’t know anymore...   England removed mask restrictions since July. German society immunology said less 0,5% breakthrough cases Germany 50 million vaccinations. first thought stupid, it’s clear pandemic unvaccinated, especially 3,5m elderly refused get jab, sadly kids younger 12-15 mean twice covid second time Bang two days over. first time like heyfeaver two weeks. generally person gets contact covid immune system fagocytes virus end presents particles specialised immune cells like T4. recognises virus spike also specific bindings. covid second time knows whole virus. produces also antibodies components spike.
With vaccin know use body recognise spike's produce learn parts. Israel’s chief public health services, Dr. Sharon Alroy-Preis, warned Sunday potential infection COVID variant omicron “very high,” stressed cases vaccinated people infected became slightly ill.

Seems anecdotal still, honestly things looking promising day. Hopefully come eat words.

Keep mind, too, coming Israel's health department, far one cautious doom-laden world. first signal vaccines wane first close borders variant came out. say stuff like this.    essential reasons travel, beyond — I’m glad I’m alone. vacation really worth spreading pandemic virus? Press conference omicron coming 35min. It'll people flew Amsterdam SA 2 days ago. still UK? standard world? single flight, thousands flights South Africa countries last months.  think there’s chance you’ll ease restrictions booster vaccinations. hope Portugal won’t another big wave, wanna travel next year :x seen reports variant originated Botswana. South Africa also regional hub (for southern africa). 

But yes, probably top 5 countries globaly viral sequencing.  decided yet, it? Israel’s chief public health services, Dr. Sharon Alroy-Preis, warned Sunday potential infection COVID variant omicron “very high,” stressed cases vaccinated people infected became slightly ill.

Laughs look Pfizer’s revenue. Seem getting rich me.  Welcome party Aussies! not. Many variants emerge months, cause thousand cases, ones cause million cases, South Africa got one (Beta). Aaand.. hello voters. Really?

Lets say considered celler option, table exsistence. Also worth bearing mind variant 14 spike mutations we've never seen before, true indeed evolve immunosuppressed individual, evolutionarily selected specifically dodge entire human immune system, rather dodging neutralizing antibodies like lab-made ones. Many people countries clowning us (Portugal) keeping masks malls public transports (and locals actually use EVERYWHERE despite law says) high percentage vaccinated individuals... guess end going useful.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  know dangerous hysteria? 

OH RIGHT, FEAR SELLS Transmissibility necessarily mean lethality. 

It’s early tell Omicron variant, let’s cross fingers, toes, testicles easily spread, less harmful. 

PSA: don’t twist testicles… that’s bad. perfect moment say shit sherlock Gone well? 40,000 new cases per day, kind insane transmission ability control new variants practically zero, even managed cook stronger Delta variant AY.4.2. 

The Torys obsessed short term completely ignoring long term reality. disease isnt even close adapting mutating. Maybe decade might see optimal virulence mutation that's highly transmissable low-impact, gonna get pounded multiple high virulence vaccine resistant strains ever year. Hell, current system high transmission high vaccination literally ideal experiment would design breed vaccine resistant strain.

The long term play isnt current strain, strains coming pipe. UK utterly failed keep case rate control gonna get hit wave wave new deadly shit. first one strong vaccine resistance gonna kill tremendous amount people.  time smells fishy.. international travel starts picking up, boom, back hole. want slow anything now? get here. even get there's still winter weather around. Everyone vulnerable got booster. change delay month? Look graph: 
 (scroll tiny bit down, mean second graph)

It seems really recent, based spreading like wildfire. Australia sequences every positive case already legal requirement vaccinated measles schools legal requirement visit school. Go figure.  work offering booster shot considering getting it. variant, even bother? get booster shot need another variant, that's 4 shots altogether. know anymore, maybe best wait. masks, get booster move forward

And keep washing hands frequently/as needed.  Yeah don’t get people traveling around world pretending Covid over. least travel somewhere 35% vaccination rate ffs. forced travel places put health safety risk work, deserve better. trust single bit information coming SA government. I'm former citizen place fucking shit show. write science.org. Yet happening certain countries already. Netherlands IC full unvaccinated people growth stopped. 🙁 Short answer: YES!

Longer answer: seems like current vaccine works new variant (at least preventing hospitalisation) mean improved vaccine can't even better job.

Also updated vaccine be, well, let's call backward compatible. There's reason kick old stuff adding new, say.

For comparison, Influenza vaccine updated every year target variants expected prevalent coming winter. process quite comparable. 
 
Vaccine protection binary thing, yes situation. specific vaccine, better protection (in general) specific variant virus, general vaccine also greatly help immune system prepare adjacent variants said virus.

Go get booster shot. alternative let antivaxers/antimaskers infect others virus want body. goes ways. analogy, put kidnappers prison, right? encouraging. Thank you. No! You’re horribly oppressed living harsh dictatorship put public safety “‘muh freedoms”. need people places point you’re brainwashed.

(/s safety) Force people homelessness don’t comply, sounds like great policy proud of. Yes . mid september states highest number unvaccinated.

So lot people . Even though ca higher vax rate...the sheer number unvaxxed could problem

&amp;#x200B;

Texas 12 million unvaxxed 
 
California 12 million unvaxxed 
 
also

Florida 
 
New York 
  Seven countries, happen one continent, never mind 2 continents could found may spreading like wildfire would scientists detected alerted everyone. 

But screw guys hard work continent ""poor friend"" mean deserve equal treatment. done fucking learn we.   professionals announcing facts already know like need confirmation? That's description feel next day exercising blue moon. mass vax site intake desk county staffed seems college kids supervised maybe 1 professional 50 temp hires. care say get churned 3-4 minutes parking lot bandaid.  way it. wanna vaccinated? Fine, society want either. force anything, can't force people interact either. Yeah, exactly I'm thinking. I'm happy get shots long makes sense. may need booster specifically new variant I'd rather wait that. COVID-1? restarting game new DLC? need sequencing identified. so-called S-gen dropout marker PCR test tells dealing variant (Alpha, Omicron, etc.), confirm exact type variant still need sequencing. Ty smooth brainer country already heading direction delta. ICUs fill up, really choice. seems like current vaccine works new variant (at least preventing hospitalisation) mean *improved* vaccine even better job.  Dude, boosters like 95% efficacy compared someone 2 doses. get saying original vaccines fare good delta. Nah dead seems case foreseeable future. long run fully expect Covid-19 vaccinating become yearly, like Influenza vaccination already is.  Lol thank validation  Legsgiving unfortunate happened close Christmas, know people mulling cancelling travel plans. information would make choice lot easier. mind much says, seem always wanting wait facts table. situation we're in, need act early imperfect information, may act way late. overall vaccination rate also high, 63% fully vaccinated. lower EU countries. 44% given booster, though, comparatively high.  Early reports say it’s easily transmitted moderate symptoms. It’s probably place already identified. It’ll weeks know sure, though. official stance Germany children generally don’t experience major symptoms infected. therefore clear indication vaccinate them. 
On hand, keep hearing serious vascular damage Covid that’s obvious first sight. keep wondering whether letting virus run expose children long term threat that’s hardly ever discussed here. Could someone maybe point reliable source long term effect COVID children predicted disregarded grounds substantial knowledge? pretty sure I've seen articles weeks ago stating South African scientists identified new strain contagious.  people get vaccinated allowed anywhere.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* bit luck, Omicron might way out. mild builds immunity strains, we've got new flu/cold affect world significant way anymore. Exactly point lol, another mutation comes another vax... (so unless ur going vax urself 20+ strains) end...

It's question accept can't protect 100% every mutation (as literally flu) get back real normality know love...

We can't keep living fear ;( Nobody really wants needs shitty prayers...anywhere.  must vaccine centre bridge house, always see lots needles left ground. No, suggesting reaction measured. best response comes vaccine covid infection. imagine vaccine infection would create robust immune response.  
Personally, I’m meds give immune response still refuse vaccinate me. could 100% vaccinated still going lockdown visited family Wales, people wore masks shops. However, masks public transport.

I hate seperate rules. would ? media reporting variant escapes vaccine. would someone unvaccinated, rush get vaccinated told vaccine ineffective? What’s compulsory? us tardos back?    played positive negative role...

Katalin Karikó, Hungarian scientist behind technology, demoted UPenn research considered important enough merit professorship. (This huge slap-in-the-face academic standards.) Companies like Moderna BioNTech, Karikó works, took huge risk trying adapt yet unripe technology use humans.  do, really? stomp foot say like it, change reality. let burn population zero restrictions, going get ugly fast. Even UK reinstating masks. solution?  Worth noting country's head public health said less opposite - infections overall mild compared Delta. Still lot uncertainty. This. Translation: it’s already 

While personally agree travel restrictions, it’s late. It’s already found Europe we’re restricting travel Africa. Much like originally thought Covid coming China, late. truly want prevent spread another country need close boarders entirely, never happen. ""We 158 days' stock country current use,"" spokesman Health Ministry said. ""We deferred deliveries."" ""Get vaccine, improve social score today!"" I’m talking intravenous injections. hell? Based CBS soaps mom watches, never even acknowledged it. imagine General Hospital acknowledged it, considering set a, well, general hospital. Dude got breakthrough case sick dog 2 months. like vaccines cure fucking pandemic. need natural also especially spike protein mutations. natural body learns fight parts virus besides protein. 

Ill probably reinfected Omicron ill likely higher chance survival vaccines without natural immunity previously. Thats fact. different, world already thought Delta final thats it. Also used word monsterous... wish too.. Left! Beautiful analogy moderna higher load, found incite higher immune response (which good thing) immune responses make us feel crappy. 3 moderna got knocked ass first 2. still stuff third responded way better, body adjusted better. Something offer consider booster issue, it’s booster makes feel bad it’s good sign felt bad, even doesn’t feel way   anyone else noticing restaurants closing left right ""for 10 days"". even local fish markets stuff. workers getting covid. im east coast. florida think people like lockdown? Don’t know anyone does. Maybe need new friends current ones enjoyed us, solid half. Go ahead concisely explain then. mitigation you’re talking about. precisely data correlates lack taking measures increase myocarditis?

You know, there's interesting perspective dumb people believe conspiracy theories.


It's short-cut feeling smart. idiot believes know something one else does. get euphoria feeling intellectually superior crave.


You're espousing one two extreme minority viewpoints.


It possible right something even though everyone else believes differently. happen twice person's lifetime would extremely rare event. even Copernicus Newton experienced that.


If seeing things others see, unlikely special insight matters others lack. might dumb. tell brilliant idea heard boof charcoal effective. long gets shot. idk eating charcoal kill him, assume activated charcoal thats maybe...idk I'm seeing lot people saying thing already spreading countries probably true fact death rates hospitalization rates spiked good sign then? might mean variant less deadly tramsmissive might actually blessing disguise.

Too early call. Covid-19 SARS, new sars variant. 
Vaccines prevent covid spread...just prevent people get sick.
google “would probably cause start taking little seriously”

If haven’t vaccinated now, doubt change minds. takes death close calls around take seriously. long way getting hell…. Depends bad compared Delta. least am, colleges change reopening plans account Delta semester. 

If vaccines still work reasonable degree (which evidence currently exists suggest do), colleges probably gonna stay open. personally hope fuck online college, really air know Omicron. Also, ""nu"" sounds like ""new"", another thing could cause confusion. CDC WHO, among others, literally advised people wear masks circa February/March 2020. April 2020 CDC May 2020 reverse opinions.

So many people maskless direction various health agencies. Fauci admitted attempt save reserve masks, information relayed ""commonplace mask wearing harm good"". worry many people continue deny vaccination children... number could grow exponentially. county, Covid, 30% already. already snowballing Covid vax flu measles. Meanwhile, I'm here, booster kids vaxxed feeling pissy af. $50 Covaids? always hope best. Experience, however, taught expect worst. evolve one HIV positive people, like person's *fault*. Evolution does, need permission. Moderna Pfizer, but... moderna's booster still stronger pfizer moderna longer/higher lasting immunity. cacses far mild. new symptoms.  me. No, need vaccines. Damn good sketch. US could definitely important improvements healthcare coverage, though support. Medicare covers people 65 older, Medicaid CHIP cover income thresholds. people receive health coverage policies employer earn much qualify Medicaid, income-based subsidies help people purchase coverage. 

A form universal healthcare would better avoid gaps coverage (or avoid people choosing purchase coverage even though they're able) fragmentation current system. Well, enough say _might_ case. Certainly early say certain.  unvaccinated blame  important thing virus severe disease makes, sick people get. now, know, cases mild. weird symptoms also SA, still looking mild. spreading matter virus mild. enough data... didn’t even happen beginning COVID HIV patient origin suspected that’s probably common cause weak immune systems southern Africa.

It could HIV/AIDS could someone tuberculosis. significant concerns here, TB number one cause death disease, tiny bit ahead Sadly many vaxxed due supply. I’d rather give people want Yeah there's reason update vaccines viruses mutate /s Great find panic check US one every hour lol  think wait May, think likely make time period original booster Omicron booster shorter, probably 2 months looking J&amp;J booster. Maybe wait even needed all, doubt Omicron **that** different. curiosity point think pandemic could avoided? they? studies? New York Islanders' next two upcoming games, possibly more, postponed due outbreak COVID-19, NHL announced Saturday. league said ""the team's games postponed least Tuesday, November players team currently NHL's COVID-19 protocol. well enough though? FDA's original effectiveness rate 50%? saying vaccine that's seen reduced effectiveness? What's floor they're willing accept need new one? always read ""still effective"" (not talking omicron) numbers quantify it. Technically 5% effective ""still effective"" Unfortunately pills good initial estimates. There's still huge gap non symptomatic know spread it, people sick get tested. Plus think rare people purposefully break quarantine unless to.


Not mention there's like national registry HIV positive people, even wanted like know who. Plus least U.S.A. self quarantine anyway.


Is really surprising things way are? ever need make specific booster, call Optimus Booster  Lmao. live life filled much fear. Gene samples COVID get uploaded database tracking spread variants, info shared research institutions around world. UKZN lot legwork figure variants spreading South Africa.

Roughly one ten positive PCR samples around country set aside sent labs NICD UKZN sequencing research. Well, testing see Omicron-specific booster even needed. thing variants: started work variant-specific vaccine testing efficacy existing vaccine variant. point, needed variant-specific vaccines. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:
  
[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* News flash, won’t.  That’s probably good thing, still plenty delta hanging around. Someone posted above. Tracing back mutations various samples omicron collected (there differences already mutations), indicates common ancestor 1-2 months ago. Two cases found Israel people haven’t left country also indicates already community spread happening there. still know sure omicron break though boosters previous infections bad doe.ls. preparing worst trying get ahead plus trying find worse so. think anyone would surprised point. Absolutely. Even going mitigate it. There's telling full impact could do. Jesus. problem?

Nobody saying vaccines bad. We’re saying even low risk event worth mitigating scale billions denominator. 

I showed actual data risks. You’re happily ignoring data. Fine, slow route might take castigate chastise people rich/mid-rich countries taking boosters vaccinating children. want give vaccines Africa, right so, going act like super trooper mode vaccinate Africa.

Listen, let's suppose even gives Africa doses take them. That's *possible* scenario. I'm going sacrifice life idiots side ocean taking part. either take vaccine offered gtfo, offense.  exactly this. need start rationing medical capacity, actively refused vaccination first lose treatment. borders closed countries receive majority flights (the EU/UK/India/China/Brazil/South Africa) 19 months. nothing. Travel bans don’t work isn’t enforced quarantine. followed reports Moderna, tested vaccine specific alterations Delta around time testing boosters original vaccine. found booster worked well enough use Delta. good keep products minimum *if* still work. first world you. Lol.

A lot people still unvaxxed due supply..

At point, die even though I'm vaccinated, I'd think meant be.   lot people aren’t going let life pass part vaccinated take least 90 days updated vaccine come around. Even comes around 90 days, 60+ age group, wait month two get it. Also literally one knows anything effective vaccine boosters omnicron. one even knows omnicron deadly delta. many unknowns.

If able get booster, get now. chances getting omnicron vaccine booster next 4-5 minths slim. Better safe sorry. good news that, likely everywhere, probably big concern fear, would definitely detected variant see massive uptick deaths hospitalizations, deadly, vaccine resistant. 

We'll wait tests sure long expect people travel? Israel locking down. banning international travellers asses situation. Israelis going lives. Googled. Sources things like sun mirror which... great say least...  Quote Twitter Hospitals overburdened Omicron patients new strain detected vaccinated individuals there. know vaccinated countries infected mild asymptomatic. - Angelique Coetzee, chairwoman South African Medical Association.

Fingers crossed. Even though it’s far perfect, well-proven, safe vaccines know masking, distancing, tracing isolating remain effective past.

But people things anymore. take vaccine drop Vaccine companies roll new vaccines fast needed.

They *design* vaccines new variants quickly, *roll out* vaccines quickly, vaccines go trials, takes months. Sadly, still limitation. cargo flights? family member working cargo airline fly really unusual routes. many people board though.  produced alpha, beta, delta variant vaccines. meaningful difference performance existing vaccine early tests. never rolled out.

Fingers crossed. unhygienic individual. Stay fuck away me. rest world get neglected creates perfect recipe stuff happening.

5 days ago, South Africa asked J&amp;J &amp; Pfizer delay shipments ""[because much far back [August, issue shifting low help \~35% rate (just recently) retired [Supreme Court Chief Justice suggesting vaccines may marked Man, fuck General Hospital making aware exists news Covid.

Fuck General Hospital. mentiom reason need flu shot every year necessarily due waning immunity evolution, due prevalent strains changing every year. Science journal one best sources get something like though. already everywhere. 

By time variant identified, already late. delusion humans stop virus spreading straight hubris. Cuz exist understand gave cool name. Plus word would ruined turned deadly hangs around many years.  cures worms! Well shit we’re gonna die reals time, see ya side un-fucking-controlled southern borders, hell would know!!! think zombie movie equivalent people recognize zombies dangerous hide away survivors think rehab despite missing organs obvious shit. might actually true. new scary strain gives everyone out. get vaccinated still pretend wrong first place. would work countries thing. problem society relies global stability, can’t countries wrecked disease others isolated frozen supply chains.

Apocalypse cultists going meltdown Biden needs rally global pandemic group get countries moving direction. Allocate vaccines globally based solely spread, targeted lockdowns hotspots travel stoppages global level, etc. 

The option accept drastically higher death rate sick elderly ppl going basis, sadly know ppl ready feel they’re personally safe (for now). 

The scary thing historically viruses mutated less deadly that’s rule, we’ve lucky. BoostCrate Mardi Gras! think safe assume even mutated, body able create immunity response Alpha Delta. I'd rather vaccine. comment drove point. Get vaccinated won’t get sick. Liar Delta rise US northeast. restaurant industry one likely undereducated workers choose vaccinated. Everyone go get boosters, wear mask appropriate, take break news enjoy life. 

There reason believe vaccines ineffective Omicron, lot reason believe effective. 

Realistically, done common sense safety measures going fine. cannot help unvaccinated more. “Don’t make Google you”.  Go ahead Google “it” explain it. can’t stop whining someone calling nonsense. It’s super lame. Direct flight even required predicted transmission rate ends accurate can't, 4 reasons:

1. cannot predict effects given mutation, combination several mutations. Right now, thing say something along lines ""Look, mutation found variant X associated faster spread/immune escape, better careful"". know enough virus make variant that's transmissible less dangerous.

2. would ethical concerns. Even getting vaccine approved challenge, much less dangerous presumed milder variant would be. People would also catch variant will, people designed would directly responsible people's deaths, otherwise died, even means preventing deaths whole.

3. Nothing would stop new variant mutating becoming dangerous, especially spreads like wildfire.

4. would essentially lose trust compliance population, since people understand anything beyond ""Hey, look, murderers deliberately infecting us Covid"" Omicron causing S-gene drop-outs one RT-PCR tests. Alpha thing. UK used track Alpha. used S-gene returning track Delta. Delta background, S-gene drop-out used track Omicron. People seem inclined here. I’m done arguing Redditor going believe believe … predicting anti body escape going need another shot nice day . don’t discredit guy posted Twitter knows hell lot Shhhh! Logic makes bees angry read we’re 58%. helpful videos, Thanks. Still sure answer original question basically similar viruses recognized B-cells find match quicker similar viruses rolling dice random B-cell needs detect antigen mutated virus?  too. I'm surprised reference place yet. easy drive NL CH. Yes, I'm pretty much certain still possible get border without finding manned border posts. know works new variant. substantially different mutation different protein spike see  within last couple days. Autobots roll out! reading this: fact they're vaccinated inherently alarming. Everyone travelling Australia must double vaccinated. default, chances vaccinated 100%. (Selection bias!) should, won't. People would rather cling religious political excuses face reality what's going on, even solution simple consequences following fatal. don’t blame you. Thanks everything do. Lots people ‘natural immunity’ Delta rolled around. It’s deadly reinfection *more* likely cause death. isn’t way less deadly variant compete deadly one, don’t understand optimism. science says it’s misplaced. ""needed"" thing really make sense. saw 2.5-fold rise breakthroughs going wildtype delta. Bringing antibody neutralization back level using multvalent vaccine could cut breakthroughs 2.5-fold (yes, declines time) let us cut vaccine dosage. multivalent vaccine would absolutely worked better Omicron, shares protein changes Beta Delta would used multivalent vaccine.

We ""need"" multivalent vaccines. Delta’s waning immunity post-infection really throwing wrench psychopathic approach. dude literal puppet. real president read note cards look handlers call next scripted question. wish actual leader spoke words thoughts straight mind. *Then* would real president again. desperately need good news. know variant?   Australia become world's largest prison again, it? India. I’ve heard it’s rough right now. mean it’s worth vaccinated mothers create covid 19 antibodies pass onto babies breast milk. Along another immune boosting factors.  Something like 100,000 people die COVID every vaccine death. every single country planet recommends it. 

The morons believe everything hear Facebook YouTube places ones believe otherwise Look India. Majority virus vaccination rate low yet much much better U.S. want hide house forever means go ahead. us want go back normal accept risks life. Here's study Lancet Nov 8, 2021 says natural immunity excellent, even multiple epidemiological clinical studies, including studies recent period predominantly delta (B.1.617.2) variant transmission, found risk repeat SARS-CoV-2 infection decreased 80·5–100% among COVID-19 previously (panel). reported studies large conducted throughout world. Another laboratory-based study analysed test results 9119 people previous COVID-19 Dec 1, 2019, Nov 13, 2020, found 0·7% became reinfected."" probably everywhere. 

Not sure often looking variants samples Americas. identified Africa Australia first mean wasnt already US spread there. isn’t regular stupidity…this advanced stupidity course would! know many online flown countries. huge deal fans. It’s first concert two years four shows one location. Yes... further, countries resources allow group people shield / isolate avoid infection avoid transmission. pretend know say. idea. I’m saying better idea, full s*** simple. every time virus replicates, there's chance coding errors i.e. mutation. healthy individuals infection cleared within week two. Meaning virus replicates period time. Immunocompromised patients effectively clear pathogens, resulting weeks months infection viral replication leading chances virus accumulates mutations. reason unvaccinated people contribute generation new variants compared vaccinated people. could mutate wants, long highly stable region mRNA vaccines target remains constant, even mostly so. hard people get heads around fact? 

I swear virus mutated Black Plague people would still talking somebody moving goalposts. never goalposts fighting unknowable enemy. that's exactly right. think unequivocally game-changing horror variant probably would know now, bad otherwise unknown.  Source this? PCR understood it, reacts specific markers. heard new variant hasn’t rendered useless. However, never heard could identify variant current application. Delta containable either. it’s find vaccines reduce severity. lot field work woods. Pretty much every time I’ve impaled (not often, often enough) get new tetanus shot. THAT’S WORKS DON’T WANT TETANUS. don’t see actual experts saying we’re back square one. 

In fact part epidemiologists saying quite opposite. Stop getting science Twitter, jeez. They’re asymptomatic, also double vaccinated.  agree more.

I willing lockdown protect community vaccines available. point, literally can't help anyone. I've done can. rest them. 

If people want stay safe, get vaccinated. especially vulnerable, consider added measures. exactly me. Yes, became milder accident spread faster dangerous variants, would outcompete anyway. fastest-spreading variant wins, regardless deadly is. said, I'm holding breath Omicron significantly less dangerous Delta. want see real data I'm making judgment dangerous might everyone’s sake hope right ……but it’s looking like way, hence lockdowns may going back square one  really. wait least week two longer that. trust stuff coming doctor. know what, happy going UK    Also one can’t support uncontrolled spread among young healthy people without also supporting uncontrolled spread among vulnerable people society mingles. want out. that's option. choices flame retardant, turning sprinklers, and/or getting rid pile kindling. trying stop idiots drinking fire extinguisher juice. It’s game man … 
No yeah calm hell world , likely beta scenario . careful don’t lock us identifying new mutation. Every day groundhogs day lately tbh they? unvaccinated cause virus mutate? Bay Area seems lot things right. yesterday saw someone commenting high vaccination rates low infection numbers Santa Clara County. living wasn’t extremely expensive… ""covid known evolve worse""

Covid unique sense every virus unique. Due contagion factor, covid mutating faster many viruses. pattern mutation less normal likely evolve way viruses do. trust doctor quoted article more? hearsay right now. Bedford said “I believe we're looking variant potentially significant immune evasion.”

That doesn’t mean vaccines become useless. EU trade organization. open borders motto. guess US developed country paid leave illness isn’t standard.  **WHOOPOOSH**   Plenty information google B.1.1.529 …….here I’ll throw bone Yes. lived there. 

Your semester abroad change facts we’re talking bar concerts. literally go ticketmaster.com scroll stadium tours. like dumb seriously think bts band holding concerts harry styles literally stadium world tour past 3 months what’s clicking Right. would financial interest actually end pandemic? could sell vaccine anymore.

So financial perspective, lucrative like vaccine companies doing: keep selling genetically old vaccine. Keeps sales rolling keeps pandemic going well, demand remains.  Need pull prayer-straps redneck capital Midwest drunkest state union One news outlet suggesting people aren’t getting seriously ill it.

Another news outlet claiming they’re seeing serious cases, including ICU admissions, among people 20s 30s. Yeah. But, really trust one doctor though? generally speaking, yes. viruses largely 1 goal - survive long enough replicate. can't replicate host dead.

that's viruses like ebola fizzled - killed host quickly. many common viral infections (such influenza) evolved less deadly slightly contagious. r/unexpecteddoctorwho completely understand.  Germany Austria seeing colder days winter approaches. Equally surprising news. hero! knew Doctor Who!  going lie, read post board initial thought well. “The” start would made sentence lot clear. ready booster? Yeah right... We're Martians. smoking dream flowers grow great rift something?  course, it’s already strange already found 10% positive one flight. amount people asymptomatic/presymptomatic extremely high. Either virus prevalence South Africa extremely high, virus infects extremely fast statistically impossible situation. 

It interesting follow people coming days.   also covid-19 symptoms, one point last winter developed really bad muscle inflammation back. Could sit move head without pain. lasted several weeks went away. Still wondering Covid. ""Plenty"" could much, much more.    Idk downvoted, maybe they’re scared wanted assurance, kinda spoiled lol That's actually excellent point.  completely untrue hate propaganda, usual glad see upvoted. 
“This always case happen” horrible logical fallacy really needs killed off.   hear much except seeing cool looking Facebook memes without sources must true would someone post wasn't?!    surprises much Omicron people testing positive - testing positive all. Maybe I'm horribly wrong thought places required testing prior travel point?  get see original virus spread around world. Vaccinated get severe case lags behind infection way unvaccinated person. South African health officials saying young, unvaccinated patients exhibiting serious symptoms Omicron. Seems like going kill lot young, unvaccinated people, anyone vaccinated fine.   Strange country say different:

Echt besmettelijke virussen veroorzaken vaak minder ernstige klachten. 

Translated: Truly contagious viruses often cause less serious complaints.

Hmmm. problem USA simply hospital resources try. leaving fates results overworked hospitals can't handle non-covid issues.  would ‘purpose’ matter people still get infected?  OMG Omicron!!!!?!?!? Ah, worries. misunderstood comment. Yeah, anyone traveling SA right moron. opinion always china open winter olympics. Yes, exactly. Delta proved theory highly transmissible strain performing killing strains becomes dominant. 

If omicron spread far easily Delta, insane Delta one transmissible viruses (strains) ever seen, Omicron outperform Delta give temporary immunity people much faster. 

It would net positive sure. remind people children 5 still among “unvaccinated”. Covid leaving casualties ranks, public told them.  make passengers ill? yea sure bro Exactly. introduced 2G regulations (vaccinated recovered) months ago. 

Goddamn political bullshit. everything 2g plus, means vaccinated/recovered effectively locked unless manage get tested damned time want go anything.

Oh, except shop. Everyone shop.

My head going explode. last sequencing South Africa shows Omikron completely taken Delta Gauteng. cases sequenced, statistically it’s impossible variant prevalent. (vaccinated recovered) effectively locked 2G plus?

I'm fucking furious this. Honest God - brutal everything right individual time, get bullshit response. Completely free accessible, townships quite big government hospitals get vaccinated. . less accessible rural areas Covid really spread there. Yes, gene Spike protein gene.  methods leave hundreds thousands dead

It didnt yet. That's point article, delaying outbreak. Nah, March already much late.

I looked nextstrain looks like Alpha Omicron split Delta broke away. Meaning Alpha Omicron closely related. wonder 69/70 deletion predates Omicron Alpha divergence emerged independently variant. ""they""? Please specific link article read. irresponsible downplay seriousness new strain cases developed serious symptoms YET. Covid19 two years learned people get tested positive even developing symptoms, serious symptoms like pneumonia appear later on. even said 10th day symptoms make break. Now, monitor couple tens, ideally hundreds new strain cases, see significantly smaller percentage people develop serious symptoms throughout around two weeks, start publishing new strain cause serious symptoms. Mandatory chips gravy!!!! still don’t know, won’t awhile, it’s best think risks still play. example young Israel girl elevated heart rate/palpitations leads think there’s good likelihood behave like vanilla Covid it’s variants regard long Covid.

That’s I’m looking it. It’s essentially like first moments shooting people think two shooters end turns one lone shooter. Best thing wait couple weeks data well vaccines Omicron. ""cautious""- yet blaming SA new strain. detected it, mean originated there.  go home? Despite Omicron sharing mutations Alpha Delta, analyses I’ve seen Alpha, Delta, Omicron appear distinct lineages. Omicron brand new variant. Delta dominant variant summer. omicron virulent say dominant wherever lands weeks. would do, curiosity? I'm fan government, what's point vaccine used (and adapted) keep life going track? ideal play strict, month-long lockdown eradicate transmission entirely course, there's way work unless coordinated worldwide. We're still working small sample size, encouraging. Let's hope similar news coming weeks less concern long covid/future health complications still unknown? Hopefully mild cases mean less stress healthcare systems I'd hate lower ""it's cold""status know that's mutated into. terrible article. went omg end world..to hey things fine. shit there's breakthrough cases. Omicron different Delta beta alpha regard. already breakthrough cases.

The media needs take god damn back seat.

“We know breakthroughs occurring, far occurred multiple vaccines,” said. “That is, itself, concerning. looking structure virus, could potential basically override immune response.”

Initial data suggest variant causes mild illness, based many cases followed South Africa, Topol said. would make sense evolutionary point view, it’s advantageous virus become infectious less virulent, Kim-Farley said.

“If virus becomes severe it’s killing people, travel much, needs people transmit others,” said. “So sense, virus seeking increase transmissibility usually actually decrease severity.” literally way hell ever going able contain COVID within first months discovery. original strain intensely infectious, may forgotten. SARS mers pesky asymptomatic long incubation period spread problem.

China one better places break detected contained early. know SARS. dealt this. authoritarian government. locked cities millions people. it. broke Africa, Europe, anywhere America would've gone way. Except less expertise SARS less power citizens. No, uncertainty. extremely tired people calling information sharing ""fear mongering"". shallow argument used discredit media particular media outlets even actually consume them.

I seen exactly zero fear mongering mainstream media, fact found Omicron coverage termpered cautious. variant.

Half point mRNA-based vaccines trivial update. got one foot! Peril? extreme word choice. True it’s already spreading among people travel history it’s already spreading longer 5-10 days right? like mom repeat things cause didnt listen. walk across street car hits cause still didnt listen mom warning it. people aren’t holding end pandemic. people dragging us many things. Climate change even bigger issue covid.  going survive shitstorm that’s coming, it’s likely going without people holding us back. Coincidentally, neck too. think covid, though! Thank service solution problem vaccine. believe it’s easy get one couple people online shout day day vaccines don’t work shouldn’t trusted. Last year variant would cause concern everyone masks social distancing. 

Now vaccine far looks job variant. months probably another booster designed beat variant better way vaccine effective, we’ll probably rinse repeat situation quite awhile like decades flu. 

At point humanity’s recent lifetime, flu basically scary Covid able turn somehow able conquer point even worry anymore. many people see freak flu like people Covid? Besides vaccine, I’d say also partially due certain antiviral stuff take like Tamiflu start showing symptoms. comes Covid, believe we’ll start treating Covid carefree way flu. argue people presence vaccine, feel you’ll really see carefreeness antiviral. vaccine pills beat it, it’s essentially over. takes simple updates medicine like flu vaccine updated every year so.

So yeah, unvaccinated definitely problem likely lead Omicrons, Deltas, Betas, name it, vaccine always meet it. think it’s best start searching articles data vaccine effects new variants conditions people sick new variant. LOT people sick double vaxxed boosters, that’s time concern, it’s opposite it’s another reason everyone taking vaccine. seen headlines. links them? legitimate concern regarding people rely industries tourism, travel, hospitality provide food, medicine, shelter.

However, issue casual travel relaxed infection control general impact essential workers. ""In pandemic, people talked lot essential workers, actually treat essential jobs. treat workers quite replaceable,"" particular concern essential workers high-skill essential workers require years train. Burning doctors nurses means fewer future. also problem replacing burned-out educators. additional high-skill essential-worker professions. major concern many high-skill essential workers feel treated expendable thus disrespected, many looking find new employment retire? happens many high-skill essential workers quit? replaced? impacts can’t replaced? fact governments acted fast compared delta already process studying hopefully modifying vaccines means actually learned Delta. Straight taking seriously start making variant concern rather dicking around weeks anything. bound happend regardless consequences might dear compared ignored it. Post Pandemic Stress Disorder news released. strain new, research needs time. People worry meantime Killing host evolutionary disadvantage. Lol research half thorough critical actual research is.   inconvenient position Israel make untrue. extremely true documented trustworthy sources.

Update priors. Join reality. severe? heard confirmed patients severe cases. Source? testing antibodies.

Does still reliably work they're vaccinated? irony username clearly lost question. Perhaps place higher value keeping family comminity alive decease free American whos highest want id go shopping without mask? suggest spend time talking citizens country stereotypical image of. Maybe Omnicron blessing curse.

I guess find out.   Exactly, vaccinated fine. like every variation. media loves pushing variations scare people. Twas joke Checking recent flights, lot flights SA recent weeks, Emirates 2 day. shudder think many travelled, new variant, became aware it, now, probably everywhere  NJ masks mandatory either Michigan. handling pretty well rules place now. see reason change it. Might time get grandmas Facebook group. You’re problem. Billions shots given you, random Reddit guy, know better rest us medical community. Get bent Imagine end 2022, new variant covid discovered, another lockdowns, travel bans, mask mandates coming effect Natural human reaction. Per CDC, it’s required even recommended. needed, they’d say otherwise!

I don’t anything it, also isn’t data mixing 50mcg moderna I’m hoping actual information conjecture people don’t know, rise cases predicted occur weeks ago (prior new variant) relaxed restrictions day Halloween. knew going happen. contrary, use invent bullshit “proves” vaccines useless. already see coming, current vaccines maybe less efficient variant, comfort stance.

Ever heard Dilbert Principle? That's hilarious corollary created guy writes Dilbert comic strip. theory ""companies tend systematically promote incompetent employees management get workflow.""

In words - companies tend identify best workers...and either promote quickly executive level, give good incentives specialize non-managers.

Middle management send worst ranks, that's bad employees cause least damage. implement policy. Unlike specialists, can't make critical R&amp;D design choices blow company bottom. also can't make process policy decisions top (exec level) either. exist no-person's land can't hurt anybody, worry employee morale, whip specialists working harder without understanding specialists doing, etc. Let offer different perspective. 

My wife used travel lot — fact, she’s Aussie met Melbourne. post COVID really haven’t. went Iceland earlier year took trip Yellowstone Grand Tetons that’s it. reason haven’t traveled four week old baby. 

But didn’t baby, we’d probably traveled more. point, live life. take best precautions — vaccinations, masks etc. hope best. 

My parents retired 70s. It’s incredibly hard able socialize travel, especially since know don’t lot years could it. 

Plus, lived South Africa, SA places like Zam, Zim, Nam, Moz, Bots etc. heavily dependent tourism economy. 

Let’s also forget vaccine. I’m vaccinated, wouldn’t think it’s safe go travel? saying vaccine doesn’t work, bigger problems (but data points vaccine working, wouldn’t travel?). 

Now obviously there’s always risk variants etc. based knew variant, long vaccinated continue exercise caution, generally safe. travel?  Whoever still convinced point immune evidence, know even worth keep trying. Safe assume others delta? They're done yet, think first PCR trick (there's one test detect one alpha, detect Delta), omicron, 13 sequences they're omicron. offence, surely could Googled it?  Oh :( That's rough :( hope feels better soon :( Sequencing analysis still done - cases still found. Interesting.  13/61 far confirmed, sounds like 13, rest still omicron well.

Gonna PCR-tests quarantine travellers. :( wrong, covid, *happy* world seemed smaller approachable. would thought exaggerating, unfortunately know exact person: want vax restrictions breath complains father law can't get needed medical care local hospital they're full COVID patients. make connection.

The person upset government get enough monoclonal antibodies cure everyone, primary care doctors giving people medicine make better. medicine? pointed rich countries world massive deaths explain magic pills register ALL. 

This someone higher education yet irrationally blind. can't understand it. RIVM confirmed Sunday found omicron variant coronavirus humans Netherlands first Friday, 61 passengers two KLM flights South Africa tested positive coronavirus Schiphol. analysis RIVM showed 13 indeed carrying omicron investigation 61 people tested positive yet completed. possible new variant found test samples, RIVM evening RIVM already reported ""almost certainly"" multiple infections omicron variant. new variant, first found southern part Africa, contagious previous coronavirus omicron variant also identified Belgium, Germany England, among countries. classified omicron variant ""worrying"" Friday. researchers yet know exactly affect course disease, reassured.

People need stop using term describe people covid antibodies 

You don’t immunity get virus vaccine.

The way get immunity getting covid vaccine. many vaccinated? South African Dr said patients mild symptoms namely headache fatigue classic covid symptoms

Likely lot people already mild issue

The alarm makes sense, though revealing perhaps false one

Here's hoping 🙏   Vaccines biologics, small molecule drugs. Giving manufacturers patent would good - manufacturing process 2 incredibly different I'll call ivermectin [used humans intended [horse paste feed stores literally checking see buyers horses selling horse logic ""Do trust anybody money involved"" sad - would make necessary trust literally medicine medical treatment all. even self treat using youtube videos youtubers also make money views. what's verdict Dutchies? Hmmm, 13? would've expected more. Definitely me. 3 days 2nd Pfizer shot March tinnitus spiked significantly. level hear day even background noise sometimes like torture. I'm overall getting booster, I'd lying said worried tinnitus getting even worse it. It’s quote article… Frankly, unvaccinated screwed even status quo Delta. point hopefully, Omicron lead many *additional* problems beyond ones currently exist Delta. That's smart. smart enough. thing could really work travel ban countries time. little less extreme: people wants enter country offer PCR-test + quarantine special hotels + second PCR-test days. countries this. react new variant detected always late. could try sequencing negative case keen wasting reagents. much unless false negative (very unlikely). Omicron Percy I8 possible would good thing someone gets natural immunity omicron keeps getting worse variants? Really depends country you’re  unvaccinated. That's problem. Sorry feel way…have great day! ""Israel Saturday said would ban entry foreigners country reintroduce counter-terrorism phone-tracking technology""
Sounds legit... people aspirate? come aspirate Covid shots? Even probability low, billions getting vaccinated, *will* happen. It’s both. reduce chances catching at, you’ll experience much less severe symptoms (including zero symptoms many cases) happen get sick.

You also reduce chances spreading others, friends, coworkers, loved ones. new data Netherlands omikron: Friday, 624 passengers arrived South Africa South Africa (last flights flight ban). tested, 61 positive. positive samples sequenced, 13 omikron variant.  trust Fauci however think correct this.  Yes BioNTech’s cancer vaccine trials failing. virus came along pivoted nicely profitability. It’s neither illegal unethical. COVID real blessing them. facts.  probably hate too. used volunteer couple nurse medical student friends e test dummy injection practice since needed live person, many times teacher like ""No, there, here"" little scary lol.  exactly. shocking mouthcaps, shocking 10% infected even though testing and/or vaccination. Omicron, that's already seen countries doubt 10% infected Thursday also. That's General Sherlock you! read book years ago called [The Peter comment reminded it, applied humanity general. TL/DR organization, tendency people rise level beyond ability manage, stay there. Perhaps applies societal scale, hit ""level incompetence"".  According people yes. Projections show yes 63% error margin 3% like start buying couple rolls toilet paper ease things. course there's *concern* virulence, data yet. Oh, shit. country often receive tourist Australia. Australia already got hit omicron, time, country also hit it. considering bad trace track ability, bet variant spread like wildfire probably late realizing one hit us omicron variant. think understand government works. govern people. Pandemic health care must necessarily handling people cannot do, order protect public health. way it. superhero Avengers entity 'save us' without involving us. 

The governments job weight competing interests figure involves. Economic interests, freedom, health. balance factor outweighs others start see system fail. Australia done really well far, considering economy fine, huge amounts deaths cases, people able go sporting events, small concerts, picnics, eat take out, support small business, go hikes, go beach, much pandemic. 

I'm glad live somewhere balance wrong shit tonne people died. People seem forget sever cases always lag behind infections. saying wrong way early make connections ‘reduce chances able get ya dick up’ talking 50 mutations, already sequenced. Pfizer Modera already vaccine designed probably already testing pre-clinical phase animal models.

I source, reasonable assumptions based mutation news long took Moderna design drug two years ago, week. know they're two years later, reasonable assumption. I’ve gotten COVID 3 times mom once, shit gonna want Adolph variant? Ew Get vaccinated save lives. Maybe even someone care for. something good life rather trying falsely boost ego pretending others fearful plain smart. Oh God people need let shit go.

They want everyone run out, buy cases masks, none left medical staff. makes perfect sense. Remember too, time saying stay away people locking down; two things that, done correctly negate, need mask.

There LOT complain initial response. ain't one them. 

It's exhaustingly stupid makes clear want blame medical experts Trump. Actually US really. hospitals privatised 22% Public hospitals, social system covering healthcare. hands big companies. 78% hospitals government personnel, staff nurses doctors like average Joe working company. 
It's interest keep hospitals running flooded co I'd patients.

Couple high numbers unvaxxed Haredi would awful. Body bags piled street awful. get it. r/unexpectedoffice UK went delta. First detected UK, miles main crossing Britain France (a country almost zero sequencing) yet France closed border UK even first cases finally detected France. anyone reported moderate mild cases new variant? Seems producing asymptomatic mild cases worst. Could silver bullet ends pandemic? Well better term might philosophy, voodoo. Philosophy humans make sense cold hard factual data driven world live in. Hah dating nurse pays  come way test Omnicron fast? I’m willing tolerate getting sick sneezy twice year means living seeing friends faces again.  happen know troops pre-existing conditions? so, could provide link sources. See specifically know scary name So... 20% then. Can't sequence negative case.  Ok, many cases Israel anyway? must sizeable sample size justify claim, Right? Last remember Israel &lt;10 cases(most probable). Dutch, doubtful it'll make : time personal also hope mutant lizards eat eyes... UK one extensive testing programs world. 25% sequenced cases world UK. fact variant detected quickly UK, days identified South Africa, tribute this. UK provides 2 free covid tests per week everyone UK, surge testing areas new variant detected. assure UK cares this. literal way government protect health system covid keep covid cases literal way restrictions.

If govts gave accepted health system write would likely hurt country much restrictions. Bulgaria like month now, rampant delta 20% vaccinated. many people dying. Well yes TRY enjoy status USD has, reserve currency currency intl contracts denominated 100% here. probably hundreds cases now. ban South Africa earth yet? Christ. Clearly deal have, also evidence points mutation around quite likely hood people continents quarantined remote whole ban African countries become even nonsensical.

When people US still arguing whether wear masks believe still idiots wear deep economically destroying lock confined houses 5 weeks ridiculous demands us like certain good allowed sold stores. 

We far stringent soul destroying measures passed upon us ever imagine punished ready alerting rest world variant (beta) one.

If think government seriously considering keeping cards chest future prevent us complete economic ruin guess people countries lack even critical thinking skills empathy already assume do. German society immunology said less 0,5% breakthrough cases Germany 50 million vaccinations. 

Citation please. looked could find anything said respect. Yeah like whether covid came lab irrelevant. Point new diseases eventually come arent prepared people die. happened human history. least today modern medicine measures reduce spread save lives.  Man scheduled get booster Friday I’m sure there’s even point getting new variant. Plus come new vaccine months new one, yeah… can't compare Turkey advanced western economies. cronies running central bank foreign investors fled. Doesn’t matter government says either. general population live lifetime masking capacity limits. won’t happen, shouldn’t happen.   Yeah probably, that's covid. I'm referring diseases general. isnt covid something else bound come us point like major disease since human history. im sure future. sub weird wtf. None headlines make sense; look generated /r/subredditsimuator Yeah percentage fully vaccinated? many vaccinate mandates helped us even get high? true, median says make children elders died sooner risk covid sorry loss. cause death? I’m assuming insulin shouldn’t diabetes Shoot. Easy choice! I’m old fat lady. never even crossed mind sacrifice health life politics (or religion, “principles”) going fuck supply chain even harder Christmas season. Well fun lockdown Australia, close… want scare kids. Also true. Even looking history obvious whether came lab nature. Diseases constantly coming us. Bacteria share planet us. machines metal bodies cells fragile. takes several weeks vaccines become effective, sounds like got COVID right vaccination likely significant protection. mean honestly think things listed problems think they've talked about. People voicing concerns issues quite loudly. think many people see concerning. 

Vaccine passports around way longer covid. already exist diseases, surprise anyone educated exist covid too. remember anyone dismissive vaccine passports possibility, dismissive idea big breach freedom whatever.

Requirements work federal level US federal gov. employees imo that's within government's right require employees, private businesses business. remember people denying idea could vax requirements go work. fact many people *hoped* would requirements work.

Fully vaccinated status shifting, slowly, accommodate science third booster necessary lasting protection. Note almost places initial 1/2 doses still enough count fully vaccinated. perfectly line expected many vaccines diseases require multiple spread doses months/years getting permanent benefit. kid(7) side effects aside sore arm covid vaccine - doses.

Should concerned get right amount?

I keep hearing pharmacies taking upon give patients right injection give saline believe vaccine... paranoid Firstly, low vaccination rates mainly richer countries able buy way vaccine priority list. Due this, South Africa started vaccinating around June year non-essential workers. 

Secondly, there's evidence strain started South Africa, happen world's best epidemiologists laboratories due high TB/HIV rates country able pick first. Since mass testing regions world yet, likely everyone's already fucked banning Southern Africa going ineffective. responded punishment volition. still want talk that, switching foreign substances inside body, scientifically tested vaccine, - know - nasty virus? adamant calling ""substance""? vaccine, modern medicine, best got. really need develop thicker skin. Well it’s mutating time still variants. really freaking lucky, omicron would far less deadly, far less debilitating previous variants, plus super infectious becomes dominant strain. well considering timeline going holding breath. came worry covid, I'm worried too. Fuck. Also 24% South Africa fully vaccinated, approximately vonly 65% people seeing unvaccinated, would mean unvaccinated people actually better proportionally vaccinated partially vaccinated.  Aspirate no? feel that? ask get booster, important you?

My second shot produced blood, forgot ask aspirated not, sure injected vessel artery. 

Your thoughts? Ugh frustrating. vast majority research results, linked, support scientific consensus. formed scientific consensus. one arguing data reference ignored, data ignored context scientific consensus recommendations regarding vaccines. keep using tiny minority inconsistent results negate vast majority consistent results. 

Again, scientists people vested interest one form immunity better another. also started including antigen tests counts starting Nov. 23rd, could contributing factor sudden spike positivity. We’ll wait see.  Ahh, seems we're reaching endemic, flu-like stage virus. 

If Covid going away, becoming non-fatal best we're gonna get.  much I'm hoping might end beginning end. fully appreciate may well reaction get clearer picture means react underreact could well getting deep deep trouble.  infection might low levels day before, rapidly reached levels needed test positive. comments filled non experts playing part experts. 

That’s like 95% internet days. stories vaccine hesitancy since story broke. literally evidence vaccines effective variant. 

We know sure Omicron turn gay, either. right headline that? matter think, dictate policy. I'm saying 2 years every government goes panic mode first sign trouble, gonna long time we're clear IV essential oils  I'd careful reading much hospitalization/death figures article gene may double risk lung failure/death COVID:

*""Around 60% people South Asian backgrounds 15% people European ancestry carry high-risk version gene.*

*They estimate risky version gene present 2% people African-Caribbean backgrounds 1.8% people East Asian descent.""*

Couple things like fact SA like many African nations much higher percentage population young, situation makes 1 1 comparisons difficult. 

I'm saying *not* high prevalence/less risky variant, variables play means unfortunately we're still ""wait see"" mode. best way protect healthcare system vaccination. endless cycles restrictions increasingly respected population. Also generally hospitalize COVID literally can't breathe. worth noting fatigue alone, even otherwise ""recovered"" devastating one's life livelihood. lot well studied spike protein mutations grant antibody resistance. lot reason need boosters due waning antibodies. 

They probably feel probability results indicating need variant specific booster high enough want start pieces development process proof need to. are. mentioned different article epidemiologists, three things done simultaneously: 
1. Test existing dosing antibodies plasma Omicron. 
2. Test larger booster dose antibodies plasma Omicron.  
3. Reconfigure mRNA vaccine Omicron plasma test (they named variant FYI get quick understanding -- part takes longer).

It's early, surprised hear 10 days existing efficacy 2 dose regiment falls slightly still pretty good, boosted even better, higher dose boost really good, data changes 2022 doses modified existing wildtypes. particular expectations. laugh people thread getting hopeful useless info. 600+ plane, 61 positive. 
13 (so far, sequencing still taking place) Omicron. important keep mind ""opening up"" means ending border quarantine.

Internally, China already opened year-and-a-half ago. essentially zero infected people walking around China, restaurants, bars, sports stadiums, theaters, etc. operate largely normal.

The trade-off people entering country quarantine. That's trade-off vast majority people China willing make, order live lives normally without worrying virus. True, would put flu level one else said thread? :) Yes that's exactly happening (at least UK). There's operational lag enacting contingency measures say hospitals testing capability. There's also value providing time research variant draw better cost benefit analysis, addition deciding conclusively non-medical interventions necessary. one claimed gospel, they? exactly expectations? less week. can't actually see reported anywhere, confirmed we're waiting results 48? want know whether ""slightly ill"" mean ill vaccinated people variants, noticeably less ill. Breakthrough infections vaccinated strains quite serious, lead long-term side effects. news obviously better alternative, health officials tend understate things terms language choices gives people often-unjustified sense security.   I'm concerned us knowing handle it, I'm worried people care handle affecting ones do. Specifically varient somewhat bypass immunity, give pressure mutate way successful. many anti vax/mask/virus world, reason things like delta omicron (most likely) exist, ones taking right steps.  already get annual flu shot changes based circulating strain get different covid shot reason? definitely selective pressure viruses become contagious less deadly. pandemics end become endemic. [here problem eventually solves itself. worry hospitals getting slammed yet worry antivaxxers anymore. made choice also skipped naming variant Xi, Greek letter right Omicron. true that's literally risk deal kinds ongoing coronaviruses well flu. many countries, older children cannot get vaccinated.

In US, lots children 5. less likely become severely sick mean catching covid problem. introduced 2G regulations (vaccinated recovered) months ago

They zero basis that. what's going *not* fear mongering considering mild actual disease fact even week? even accomplish? reduce rates lots people still infected

And evidence OP sought posts specifically disagree far that’s case variants, alpha beta dominated Delta. There’s nothing show us changing, but, it’s early. 

In terms likelihood, based scientists posting Twitter, I’d lack concern means it’s likely. Thank you, helpful! point, masks thing people willing tolerate, way people going go back days curbside pickup resturaunts, ""virtual"" concerts, Zoom thanksgivings, mandatory 6ft apart spacing situation. Ah - that's right. Resistance futile, efforts stop mutations useless. Give now, thoughts/prayers loved ones wind ICU, assuming get bed. Covid wins, wave white flag. I’m commenting can’t believe it’s almost 2022. ""Nothing worry, guys... let us steal masks shots tarmacs"" least 13. finished sequencing. 6 months almost caught (presumably) Delta two weeks ago. might good idea fudge 6 months bit get early. sheesh accidentally read ""**new** severe covid cases...."" . glad case natural immunity omicron cause immunity variants? 

If everything said true I've seen concluded. also worth noting 'Covid concern people pre-existing conditions' talking point become new attack GOP news networks. intentionally misleading.

The argument presented as: ""evil democrats want get vaccine, want scared, I'm going tell something won't. need scared, look cases, majority people pre-existing conditions. healthy, need worry.""

The problem? intentionally ignore estimates many 80% Americans pre-existing condition. course majority cases cases bad outcomes among people pre-existing conditions. Near end 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic (18 million dead opposed 5 million dead covid far) emerged several fast-spreading mild strains eventually choked potent strains contributed end pandemic. smart people saying? Michigan terrible covid. Masks required. Many still vaccinated. family covid Thanksgiving. stayed home. vaccine boosters yet. Might wait new booster since omnicron probably already spreading here. Case numbers high among vaccinated non vaccinated.

It's crazy many people michigan 1 dose think that's enough. local government little limit spread here. shame time Christmas. link wrong article? one posted says lack interest among Palestinians Palestinian Authority done lot encourage people. kind implies enough, trouble getting people get jab Yeah things come nowhere sometimes. Even ignore controversy around covids origins bound happen eventually. So, yep. is. New normal. want say find funny downvoting saying need move life. people really wants stuck pandemic mode. air travel open shouldn’t it’s governments shut random people, wisit historic sites stupid tourist things dont get started Journalist.

You cant compare China country 100 days til manufacture prioritize elderly hugest risk first…with rollout probably end around 6 months anyways. meantime stronger protection delta, still common strain home, potentially even omicron (it’s unknown) holidays winter potential really devastating wave. that’s closed borders over, compared Delta? We're nearing point showing hospital COVID willingly unvaccinated put back queue. makes absolutely sense many critical non time-sensitive surgeries procedures like heart surgeries cancer treatments put hold Billy Bob Texican get free vaccine personal freedoms. really even see ethical dilemma anymore, people made choice welcome suffer consequences. way hospitalised every person tested positive.

No medical system world enough beds sheer number people. 

You mistaken. even link prove wrong. peak recording 23,000 positive cases per day. Again, hospital system world capacity take man patients. Going long two weeks. 

As ""If vaccinated person virus don’t develop symptoms that’s sign vaccine working,"" that's necessarily true. COVID caused asymptomatic infections people along. 

We need LOT data. even ability evade vaccines overstated, still huge unvaccinated pool potential hosts, many gathered inside droves, without masks, last days.  Hi! first thing found articulates smallpox (and viruses like it) mutate incredibly slow rate. One mutation put us flat asses. definitely happens. We're talking completely different virus type here. time, see Polio 3 variants, can't find info long took evolve moment (on vacation, sorry). wrong course, two diseases exceptions happen. exceptions, rule. also exhausting people pushing strict measures remain place enforced people, vaccinated not. nearly 2 years since tried flatten curve... remember that? blame want, going demonize individuals when, population level, acting as, well, humans. We're worker bees, we're programmed same, God we're not. 

Do want people vaccinated, yes indeed. However, even population 80%+ vaccinated Delta would still circulate spread... Omicron indeed many times infectious Delta able escape vaccination degree, what? Wait entire world vaccinated new Omicron-specific variant? Yeah, thanks. I'll let everyone risk calculation move life. least eight hospitals 100% full, according latest state data. West Michigan’s largest hospital system, Spectrum Health, reached system-record number patients hospitals ICUs. Makes sense, antibodies first line defence prevent us becoming infected.

If variant bypass catch it.

However, b cells job virus stopped progressing severe state. 

So doomsday scenario making naive. Uhm rule.

It well deadly easier transmit.

In long run possibile true, since might take seriously snuff out.

But fun time then. Time stop travel bans specific countries. need punish SA testing/sequencing thoroughly discovering new variant variant everywhere. evidence Delta? I’m one accusing fear mongering. seek posts disagree opinion post opposing opinion them. Kinda sus every similar comment 5 downvotes Barking ppl asks questions work- would think 🙄 need said keep forgetting reddit Viruses become less harmful long term, there’s also evolutionary path happens wiped population didn’t natural immunity. I’m listing reasons I’ve seen given people concerned variant. Possibly outcompeting delta reason I’ve seen put forth several times different articles. mind, too, coming Israel's health department, far one cautious doom-laden world. first signal vaccines wane first close borders variant came out. say stuff like this.

It matter doom laden usually are. Unless much larger sample size know, likely don't, literally making claims **four** vaccinated patients. sample size says nothing actually severe variant is, anyone believing otherwise deluded.  fuck mean? country 1 billion, great fire wall, launguage barrier top complete authoritarian power, want could kill burry millions single person would know. clue from. question general viruses. pity 2 different sources give us different infomation. difficult determine real not.


 think might important consider statement less deadly life virus micro level we're dealing now. change happened virulent variant might horizon fully neutered. 


Just aware blanket statements might fully pertinent virus loose still significantly changing. might bump road less deadly strain. heard weaker. still anecdotal evidence. get empirical LONG TERM evidence, can't say anything certainty. early draw conclusions. 7 Variants Interest Delta Omicron heard none entities reacted strongly them. Greek letters Alpha Omicron except Nu Xi used. mean fucking way ain't working
? botswana It’s terrible see given up. Yesterday headline 1 10 new cases US Michigan.  Vaccination magical pill. Data already proven highly vaccinated nations still high infection rate, moreover new strain. vaccine effective super mutation strain. way lockdown ban, like wise leave door open, inviting dangers home. Tell Alpha declined massively prevalence Delta came around barely exists anymore. People tried facts. data everywhere. actually cared REAL information, getting social must sizeable sample size justify claim, Right?

No don't. whole thread bunch people rejoicing worthless anecdotal ""evidence"". Omecron variant sure would travelled fast South-Africa Israel did. So, obvious statement. governor Alaska could probably stated same...  UK already bad enough right now. father go hospital stay overnight last week referral doctor (thankfully nothing major, better now). stay 6 hours bed A&amp;E, eventually found bed women's ward. Yeah, whole political game.

China gains benefits lying

1. Chinese people isolated due great fire wall
2. people outside China dont know Chinese
3. show superiority world dont wanna seem like weak country many decades ago seriously believe random introverts influence implementing lockdowns, pointless discussing you. 

You're pissed people mind restrictions much do. see bad relationship family. He's nuts. omicron dominant less/barely lethal (which know officially proven yet), surely contributing helping halt well? necessarily apply SARS-CoV-2 incubation period, selective pressure less severe transmission occurs symptoms present. Key word: “may”.

Even new vaccine becomes available better protects omicron variant chances masses line take it? I’m guessing slim. Vaccine uptake states already terrible. Messaging CDC blunder. People simply don’t understand ever-changing situation say “see goalposts keep moving.”

I’ll gladly take new doses necessary, don’t feel like that’s going case most. Hang there. peaks eventually.  Exactly, 

Its like telling liver transplant candidate suffering etoh cirrhosis stop drinking 6 months transplant. large organ shortage, gift organ isnt taken lightly. little sad tribal is. Turn TV think yourself- victim outrage pornography cycle. literally repeating talking points mindlessly point non-sequitur. ounce rational thought realize spouting cable news talking points day help anything, actually trenches people (including yourself) deeper culture war dogma.  r/Masks4All
Bonafide masks well regarded, people found Powecom masks Office Depot well. People also discuss N95 masks five recommendations. Still worry long Covid right? I'm sure newspaper thinking clicks all. There's way we'll variant booster 6 months now. Everyone needs get existing booster now. one thing ""make"" new vaccine, whole thing regulatory crap. still variant booster Delta despite vaccines work well preventing infection anymore (6 mos antibody neutralization completely gone bad). point hospitals protocols place somewhat manage Covid surges, really specific mean say “reasonable” context. you’re really describing extreme staffing shortages crisis standards ration care, standards aren’t way normal functioning. mean days long waits, people sent home oxygen crossed fingers, folks turned away, insane levels staff burn out, necessary medical procedures put hold, “elective” surgeries canceled, cancer treatments postponed, etc. You’re talking lots people suffering unnecessarily, still think that’s big deal, encourage talk medical staff who’ve worked Covid surges. I’m genuinely trying sound alarmist anything like that, could look eyes family members working places see toll it’s taken, you’d reevaluate. Yep, Russia too.

The reason hyper-aware distinction supposed fly Morocco, via Lisbon, coming Friday. still go today's announcement. said ‘chips’ thought meant Doritos. really bummed. Need info state unvaxxed well. omicron suffocates hospitals unvaxxed deep shit long provide help?  version story read NYPost yesterday can’t link here, search Coetzee emphasized patients healthy, expressed worry elderly unvaccinated patients could hit omicron much harder –especially comorbidities diabetes heart disease.

So don’t know sure happens vulnerable population yet. far seems like least won’t worse. Fingers crossed. one's extreme lockdown measures stock market like 3%

There plane stopped Amsterdam turned people infected wearing masks so... That’s Israel extremely centralized national healthcare system. makes easy gather data. government also recruited army help management virus vaccine distribution. Making someone else money? Weird outlook bon economy. mutual arrangement employer I. make money, pay one highest pay scales union workers field country. yeah, prefer work take 40% take home unemployment time.

Obviously dramatic, like literally watched Netflix day. functioning member society far greater emotional intellectual benefits working out, reading whatever offer time. That's me. Everyone different. agree I'd rather see car/train coming SPLAT stepping road Russia, yeah? suppose technically may misspoke, surely massive swath Europe’s population. saying beginning pandemic... 

If there's chance bypass immune system long lot transmissive infectious, matter aquire somehow deadly rate SARS MERS one mutations. 

We got luck Spanish flu turned less deadly variant know common cold nowadays, luck COVID-19? Yeah can't imagine. vaccine passports unvaccinated can't go restaurants etc. places course check suppose end January. Please think minute. 

The conduct CCP Wuhan outbreak transparent Soviets Chernobyl exploded. issue - dozens examples Chinese government fudging information covering stuff up, sorts fields sorts crises. present day historically. They're ever forthcoming situation enormous magnitude even censors can't maintain control. fact they'll still manipulate/rewrite history.

Even worse, **local governments healthcare administrators punished covid outbreaks region**. incentivises extremely harsh crackdowns suppression reporting. region city reports covid cases many, CCP ass. government also propaganda reputation uphold: infallible; full control; alone bulwark Chinese people covid. covid outbreak messes narrative. reported COVID outbreak occur also squarely blamed foreigners. matter virus shown survive inanimate objects even spreads via animals. 

But sure, trust Chinese government. Nevermind lying people, they'll surely open situation international media.    unvaccinated?

The CDC entire page dedicated risk profile known Covid19 comorbidities.

SMFH Source this?

Vaccinations never really created stop infection.... keeping people alive.  plan getting booster first place? improve waning immunity 2nd dose? so, something happen week leads believe 2nd dose last months? not, get booster let scientists figure best omicron practices side, gives people hope. - that's big - news hit weeks vaccine indeed needs updated, people remember going 1-1.5 years again.   vape smoke spread covid?

Like infected vape, would spread right? Yes many, many people know diabetes walkin’ around 300-400 sugar levels. true. suits well. even try keep citizens going better controlled. No, don’t trust people like demonstrated zero qualifications make statements you’ve making. opposed family friends working healthcare research said qualifications. 

For know information gleaned session huffing paint fumes. yeah let's also remain blissfully ignorant, making irrational claims. Good Job. Fauci says lot things. another one ""White lies""? add person said bit explanation: clinical trials, participant monitored symptoms contracting COVID-19. agencies companies analyze data determine breakthroughs common particular subset people without X symptoms. detectable association symptoms vaccine risk contracting COVID-19. likely *if* impact immunity, it’s quite small, extent couldn’t detect trial 10s thousands participants.

Hope helps! think small party suddenly want restrictions mahority changed.  I’m concerned variants Omicorn could produce mean much, majority population SA unvaxxed obvious they're also gonna majority cases hospitalisations.  Among?


Kinda sus.




Kill please I? absolutely are. people spreading miss information one same. roughly zero percent chance mutates bind different protein bind to. would complete rewrite protein sequence spike protein. Actually, vaccines free widely available private public healthcare open 18 since August. Dammit, got booster…I’m going plan another day 2022 lay bed side effects. Yolo guess half measures. Put unvaccinated camps end pandemic. Cool. always say no.

And say ""yes"" it'll due punishments place saying ""no"" therefore longer wirksame Zustimmung thus say infected antivaxer? Nope, think so.

Again, different matter entirely individuals state disregard Grundgesetz. Agee. well go full lockdown zombie outbreak happened, although taking refugees mistake started singing setting zombies off. update flu vaccine every year one blinks. Seems logical another mutating respiratory virus would also require vaccine updates.  something contagious , chance mutate becomes higher could mutate lethal-highly-contagious-vaccine-resistant strain. Ok? experience doesn’t represent everyone else’s. Here’s articles August last article interview Fauci flat says protection maybe lasts 6 months therapies needed ultimately end.   really, especially population density high incubation/transmissibility period high. real way fight basically month long extremely tight lockdown. Seeing one willing that... well go. really. Israel strict covid measures. think they'd minimize Especially chip shortage. Prepare? Like hoard TP?  Wait till find new strain pushed make stock market go become scapegoat impending market crash Take look childhood vaccine schedule. pretty normal. 

DTaP three-dose series (at 2, 4, 6 months) boosters \~15 months \~4 years. Adults supposed get every 10 years.

Nearly two years in, COVID appears mutating slowly compared RNA viruses, fast influenza. Notice boosters exact vaccine remained effective date.  get point, kind irony saying headline carefully chosen generate clicks remedy to…click article. really believe there's 0 covid cases among 1,3 billion population. 

There zero cases. double triple digit cases per day while. Also note China much much strict country comes COVID. Containment works far right holding country hostage.

Also, way secret major outbreak happening China. Even Wuhan outbreak, rumors already running amok social media. rumors China

In case, people like would satisfied hear millions Chiness dying infected “fair“. that's true, still endless fantasizing conspiracy theories. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

People please get vaccine, not, ain't gonna miss ya. “hospital beds full” stories garbage. Hospitals designed full capacity. fill really quickly 100%. lots ways, reasonable sketchy, increase capacity. we’ve seeing stories 2 years now. basically know anything mutation. mutation could nothing burger like alpha, beta, nu etc. But, yet saw stock market go down, people panicking, even travel bans. ridiculous.

they leave unvaxed mixing mingling rest us, KNOWING chance breakthrough infections (that clear beginning, vaccinations) have....WHAT evidence exactly change calculus?

seriously - changed last month aside exploding cases ICU overruns UNvaxed?   watch news everyday ZDF. think areas Sachsen (around Dresden) bit hard time, that's mostly due fact that's Bundesland lost vaccination rate bought big box N95 Costco. Highest rated masks trust supply chain counterfeit. $150 100 masks. 

If order online, need member. add $5 fee non members IIRC. Alpha uk strain - original covid.  ""Most people see coming"" bothered pay attention think anyone predicting crazy. Look happened Europe vaccine protection overstated peiple thoughtthey 100% effective. People need know still need careful now, know Omicron, before. Saying stuff like part problem. Vaccines culture war making kinds generalizations contributes making that. stop it. Reading news fine. aware ""could"" ""may"" often get twisted certainty they're actually expressing exact opposite. go incredibly quickly ""we know X"" ""X may true"" ""scientists say X"" Inb4 TP joke new ones usually show first NYC, Cali?

I looking flair, I'm fully vaccinated too, feel matters much point. There’s high risk neutralizing antibodies prior vaccination prior non-Omicron infection won’t stick.

What basing off? modeling mutations? mean people recently received booster need ride storm another 5-6 months, new variants sweeps country? amazes many years zombie movies one actually talking dealing here. 
The plot movie unique, virus causes global pandemic 21st century time see rise zombie like behavior…  flu vaccines United States “quadrivalent” vaccines, means protect four different flu viruses: influenza A(H1N1) virus, influenza A(H3N2) virus, two influenza B viruses.  Yes exactly! I'm thrilled covid vaccines studied long term effects, got jab anyways bc it'll better covid.

The confusing people ones fear vaccine side effects, covid ""just flu."" Like either worry studied  It’s feasible letting hospitals get overwhelmed either. That’s it’s going countries while. Denmark, positive cases sequenced.

It's worrying people upvote misinformation. achieve would take 2 billion hours computing time per day Wait, really bad ? say briefings countries ? universe Moscow Times mainstream media? Groundhog's day? can't blow off. That’s several flu vaccines work, too.   think meant difference quickly spreads dangerous effects are. Influenza vaccines already updated year year. no, you. Imagine gives gas Dr noted loss taste smell patients saw gonna lie... read ""Doctor Who"" ""Dr who"". may need go sleep. Sorry hear mate. Glad vaccinated, hope guys get better. 

Am curious affects vaccinated people. Please keep us posted. Aroha New Zealand Yep actually becomes flu. take vaccine whole life avoid worst consequences finally gets old age. wouldn’t surprised cause helped creat damn thing! doesn’t. Travel bans work countries cannot surges variants faster spread beyond borders. It’s either let hospitals get overwhelmed, affects everyone needing type medical care. plenty vaccine turning shipments away actually. true holiday get together eat people.   Sure it’s great plan act like mild. get data it’s better cautious.  Omnicron another variant eventually emerge. Covid never going away. Get annual shot, hope best, live life. terrifying FYI, Delta first spotted late 2020. start fucking us months later. I'm trying optimistic, omicron month two old necessarily mean blow up. Vaccines work well immunocompromised individuals. SA sky high prevalence HIV (unfortunately) distribution antiretrovirals far perfect.

The origins Omicron actually quite fascinanting; direct descent early branch, come delta.

One theory developed single immunocompromised individual got infected 6 months ago (maybe even 2020), i.e. Omicron might result prolonged battle virus immune system single person.

Similar ""crazy strains"" seen cancer patients (e.g. [article can't help find theory fascinanting, like last large pandemic (HIV) might fuel new one. long causal chain goes Congo 1920s HIV started Omicron today, ~100 years later.

Ideally everyone HIV would access antiretrovirals, good, good public health measure. Yes. remembered sudden increase cases got attention scientists started investigating increase cluster. don’t know truly mild gets worse later, worse without vaccination. don’t know. Would new one cause issues delta vaccine end making us vulnerable before? second that. It’s horrifying doctor could give bad information. Actually, think opposite true, South Africa exelent testing build HIV gene sequencing, that's discovered really useful early on. Banning travel countries ones banning already thousands cases day pointless. IIRC, recent spike entirely composed Delta based sequencing data. We’re seeing expected effects colder weather/less precautions. help international flights testing arrival part customs departure. 250 people sealed tube 16 hours 6 test positive arrival, course people around test clean less day post exposure. They're less danger, though. Airlines desperate customers care part they're playing. They're mechanism variants jumping oceans. could gatekeepers instead they're super spreaders. Let's go crazy.  Downvoted sharing alarmist headlines. Like water sieve Show peer review studies prove less deadly less transmisible... can't. proof need treat every variant like thus upmost caution. Especially one 3060 mutations ability evade vaccine. Michigan education system work. Sorry. soon know ever happens I've heard (had another friend woke one day). Straight ER so, they'll sort out. made full recovery (both guys, testicles). Israeli scientists ""experts"" literally less said so. follow experts doomsday predictions ? think people crazed evidence little self projecting here. Makes sense. Hungary people go Chinese Russian vaccines based older technology older people particular trust more. despite supposed lower rate efficacy compared western vaccines. gather would killing lot young people article? Like water sieve Ok cool.  Literally, need one google search ""vaccine versus natural immunity covid"" get slew results. That's think pointless, they're easily available many many results simple google search interested learning topic. Clearly bothered single google search topic. Like water sieve seeing information? saw one patient abnormally high heart rate, haven’t seen anything regarding blood pressure. *Raises hand Explain that's clickbait headline. important question need answer people want know answer to. If, instead, confident cause severe disease headline still said 'WHO reveals possibility Omicron could cause devastating illness' .00001% chance...then sure, that's clickbaity. literal fact. Everyone wants know, know, researching drug companies need identify happen. headline suggests unknown mean clickbait...that's fact, know. Yeah works great pox viruses mutation rate low. 

Something like covid still want vaccinate since SARS mutation rate much, much higher average. mutation faster spreading, weaker, virus possibility much deadly virulent strain mutates seems good theory could devastating right circumstance. second paragraph late edit, too. Somehow, knew cv19 vaxxed. Somehow......... China million excess deaths. China lies. Seems like story better suited local news sub. Literally every state like need watch ""Inglorious Basterds."" (It's worth it!) assume it’s helping. vaccination rates good still climbing, friends able get walk booster shots without appointment fuss. focus independent pharmacies especially good many remote mountainous places staffing can’t easy. straight extreme lockdown measures.

How temporarily halting travel countries, “extreme lockdown measures”? 

Baffling think bare minimum extreme. feel emphasized still much learn everyone still vaccinated - seeing sample young healthy patients?

Her saying mostly affected 40 (who also highest group unvaccinated South Africa) isn’t saying younger people patients seen whole practice. 

As understand reading article - younger affected group older vaccinated population isn’t seeing level impact. 

However, groups hasn’t severe Delta cases mild.

Am missing something information there? parent wouldn’t want best reduce potential risks kid? take necessary risk mitigation measures like using rearfacing car seats following safe sleep practices. things take responsibility control. can’t get kids vaccinated yet therefore rely others “right” things… sadly that’s apparently much ask many people. Doctors South Africa saying thing.  feel like almost pointless link studies say opposite claiming.

Absolutely ridiculous completely transparent. Stop making excuses fact evidence back saying. happened Europe? IC units full unvaccinated people, clearly showing vaccines effective. give non-vaccinated people free ride boosters eventually needed. 

But vaccine protection overstated.  side effects seem way worse flu vaccine.

No, really don't.

In US alone, adults taking flu vaccine somewhere within 40-50% range, whereas 70%+ taken least one dose COVID vaccine. jump ~50% ~70% difference 40 million adults. massive sample possibility severe symptoms dramatically increases population.

So natural hear people adverse symptoms *you people taking it*. fact new vaccine also increases chance nocebo effect.

I booster yet I've shots far 24-hour turnaround time sore arm fatigue. much different reaction take another schedule vaccine, tetanus shot. single person know bad reaction COVID vaccine, know someone bad reaction flu vaccine. lesson can't take anecdotal data read online hear people group think empirical. People far likely complain bad experiences; people inclined share stories totally fine feel. make sense. accurate picture hospital capacity city many people inside right now? 

Anecdotally sure don't. depend published statistics like anyone else.  Speaking which, seems kind unhelpful share articles behind paywall readers aren’t going spring for. enough problems people reading articles even can, sticking absorbing often misleading titles. Yeah, South African decided visit family last week whilst working US EU visa, guess what? trapped country live/work now, God knows long. happened bunch people original travel ban, many many articles time.

If governments keep randomly restricting travel countries every time new variant pops up, course people visas going nervous traveling/visiting family. leave, suddenly find variant country, can't come back. worth risk entire career life stake.

If going easy see situation is, trust me. big deal.  agree need wait see sure. it’s purely knee jerk thing. 

The scientific community raising alarms. variants. mutations modelled scientist year ago possible mutations would highly problematic. coupled sudden explosion cases SA cause concern. 

Now wait data analysis confirm. nothing all. exceptions, see restrictions coming back. That's right, wasting time. question natural vs vaccine-induced immunity politicised pointless discuss actual science US-dominated websites.

You see effects here. posting links research actual scientists getting downvoted, person making *claims* ""all evidence"" points way, without providing evidence whatsoever back up, getting upvoted. vaccine created mutations nearly 99% ineffective. Imagine lied every step way evil fucks yet still trust best interest heart lmao. I'm fully vaccinated getting booster. think I'm antivaxx go eat brothers asshole. Fool once... wont fooled - Bush.

I'm fully vaccinated covid. vaccines.. know.. ones actually work prevent designed prevent? covid vaccine fucking work cannot understand now.. data showing many covid vaccinated people still GETTING COVID, SPREADING COVID, DYING COVID fucking stupid understand that. yet going try blame unvaccinated people FUCKING GOVERNMENTS CAUSING THIS. wake dummies time.

I love thay used George W Bush quote, quote famously butchered he's dumb dont need asshole study done.
But would interesting see rate side effects aspirated vs non aspirated groups. countries default want quick data.

If theory gains traction, might see study. 
And eat words then.
For proof injecting vaccine vein cause myocarditis animal model. enough dig further. Looks like we’ll seeing fewer Republican voters remaining next wave. Yeet whack job conspiracy theorists saying cnn fauci talked way back 2020 lmao reporting severity covid virus media expert shit happening china. Let’s see whole covid mess takes us next months years requirements added. hope hear new unique information cnn fauci nut jobs already discussed million times years ago. Also good one. 72.3966222 repeating, course. know mean well know nothing yet. Wait another week two panicking spreading worst case scenarios online. Also remember effective treatments didn’t months ago. Maybe media informative instead click bait headlines create unjust unmerited hysteria Personal anecdotes meaningless. peer-reviewed studies showing otherwise, everyone treat variant far deadly contagious covid variant since delta. Well said. US total tool people.
Israel leader! Cowpox vs smallpox exactly thinking of.

If works maybe net positive. 

I'm jaded hope yet though. Source data says evading vaccines severe hospital numbers deaths due omicron. ""You good last job,"" now, done pandemic started, people actually dumb enough forget badly pandemic handled didnt mean covid would dissapear literally... dissapear mention news/social media outlets. see... I'll come back thread covid-sanctioned passports mandatory vaccinations regular cadence written law. Communism inbound! Talk soon good start would pronouncing right. I've seen ""omnicron"" ""omicorn"" quite bit. Oh/Ah Kron 800k deaths relatively small price pay live totalitarian dystopia. risked getting sick, potentially dieing unable look children even worse, passing disease children could get time kids could get it?

Meanwhile every medical expert anyone merit degree biology medical sciences pleading everyone get vaccinated so? wonder world state currently in. Nope I'm good thanks advice. That's weird?

I'm arguing statement... idea. happenstance played past considering indicated occurs? connection transmission severity? sounds like video game. Sure, raise transmissible level, lowers severity symptoms. death count gonna suck, never reach high score. COVID probably never going away. Israel usually takes pretty extreme measures Yet mask advisory. Right, know they're antivaxxer?

Also, I'm curious significance pre-existing conditions ***far*** antivaxxer.

They asked question everyone *assumed* malicious. much even *I*'m downvoted association.

Scientifically speaking, viruses evolve adapt able transmit better. 

This one need to, already evolved pretty well it. even adapted way life packed schools, international travel, antivaxxers politicians want unpopular necessary things. Agreed. locked cities millions people. it. I

Afaik it. Wuhan virus free point. ended importing virus like countries, like deadly boomerang. think delta ever though. 4. Seems possibly outcompete Delta.

While technically true, due word ""possibly"" there, pretty misleading. could accurately put ""seems possibly anything"". 

We really good data yet suggest outcompete Delta. hardly Delta South Africa Omicron outbreak. hardly *covid* South Africa Omicron outbreak. really seeing evidence **yet** Omicron outcompeting Delta. yet seen happen Omicron introduced population already overwhelmed Delta. there's real evidence yet suggest put true. diseased continent  ""Israel's health department, far one cautious doom-laden world.""

Agree that. contagious+less deadly good thing since people would catch without issues develop immunity?

... number significant mutations theorized result someone poor immune system catching covid... could easily reach many people simply roll doomsday dice again.

It feels like compelling argument, think it, realize substance longer exists cannot effect you.

This acute studies sufficient. Vaccine reactions adverse events occur short term.

Of course, short term effects may long term consequences, depending effects (a headache fleeting, example, blood clot may cause damage never fully heals). comes vaccines, quite well understood decades data vaccination.

It also plainly evident covid *does* cause serious adverse effects acute infection long term consequences. risks occurring far greater vaccine (as I'm sure know). regard data quite clear, ""long term studies"" provide us usable information comes adverse events risk.

What absolute moron weird... omicron worldwide months? anyone sequenced blood possibly saved weeks ago never tested? studied yet. Totally understand, answer question different everyone. Personally, I'll sacrifice many years takes keep elderly parents safe. everyone either relationships priorities, truly judgement call society needs make together. Unfortunately one complete agreement. *Hopefully* still remain civil it. new south park movie yet ? 40 years still going on? Ya that's even joke going happen.

I feel man. understand this: even South Park lampoon *real life* society, still cartoon, still *fiction*. magic ball tell future is. top.

They episode internet fell boys found root cause giant router rebooted, episode said Family Guy wroten manatees.

COVID still exist future, coming decades, there's chance become less threat. going take much much longer, maybe couple years more. Oh go look. saw yesterday maybe changed? actually insurance meet deductible first high. think I'll wait tomorrow see headache subsides feel better. like severe chest pain. I’m expert think drug want chemical compound bind somewhere specific. vaccine RNA goes cells cells produce antibodies.

So drugs like “consume compound” mRNA vaccines like “here instructions make compound” says study referenced OP booster shot doesnt fare well new variants opposed natural immunity. even mutate unvaccinated person immunity would effective, whilst booster shots would not.  chance 600 people two aircraft COVID independent individual. It’s random sample. Obvious examples would large group traveling together many returning conference superspreader event occurred. This! comment help sleep tonight. say typically, offer example?  Africans aren’t strictly antivaxxers. Lots African countries ordered haven’t gotten any. usual, westerners rushing blame poor poor. 

South Africa one country entire continent. 3 shots get would fucking hope so. 

That isn’t reason get vaccine, whole point reduce hospitalizations it’s nice know 3 jabs protected worse Covid also better immunity someone took risk got infected naturally.  ""importation party! South Africans fly free!"" credentials make definitive statements? mean Xi variant. Conveniently emerges maxwell trial. It’ll never end. * crickets * ZERO evidence this. It’s popping everywhere going likely true variant well.

Depends different is. Delta-specific booster prepared ultimately determined worth similar root virus, meant targeted booster would offer limited benefits. 

Omnicron significantly divergeant might different time around. might still worthwhile. We're gonna trust professionals.  spend 10 minutes reading virus mutations, that’s think. muscles tiredness

til i've corona omicron years dont know from, similar things said fx US (2019 Forbes survey):

Eleven percent survey respondents never traveled outside state born.
Over half surveyed (54 percent) say they’ve visited 10 states fewer.
As many 13 percent say never flown airplane.
Forty percent questioned said they’ve never left country. course closing borders fail wait days publically set deadline day, thus causing widespread panic fleeing back home countries. words, South Africa grown pair months ago made people take jab yes yes. There's little bit nuance this. Apparently first 4 patients foreign diplomats. 
So adds whole extra layer countries banned. 

Think issue SA detected Belgium countries shutting borders Belgium. 

It's also SA arent actually changing alert levels, scientists yet view dangerous.
Prevailing theory discovered Germany world would shut borders quickly definition vaccine absolutely supposed provide immunity. try follow Israel’s caution, CDC. got 3rd one Aug 18-21 sincerely hope you’re correct. comments gibberish rambling data. added substance this. Yeah, used HIV thing example information didn’t believe. think thanks quantum computing. longer need silicone based chips vaccines. also reason new generation chips even smaller go easily needles. (/s someone really needs it) results large ambulance queues hospitals full admit new patients. Massive waits A&amp;E (ER) departments beds patients lying corridors days. Horrendous stuff. natural selection. percentage, even USA lot antivax sentiment, still managed vaccinate 60% full scheme. hand, SA one fifth USA's population, less antivaxxers USA, less people vaccinated, even plenty doses.

Guess natural selection job here. say they're right virus going away mandates reach. Oh let's forget logic of, vaccinated get spread too?

Just wondering, less likely spread covid vaccinated protected severe disease death. [CDC Stop using buzz words like “high alert” Come on. ""Traitor"" tightly defined.

Just give general discharge along kick ass. Good point, think also need know type test pre-flight. purely conjecture, wonder due mutations pcr picking variant up. Would certainly make sense given UKs switch PCR entry country opinion ""rational dialogue"" whatever Joe Rogan tells think rational dialogue is. making pointless sequiturs? vaccination rate lower Republicans right wing people factual statement. Less vaccinated = likely die. likely die = harder pass genes.

If anything, looks like unwilling accept wrong. good deer CDC testing contact tracing? current vaccine good enough need new one? messaging confusing. know something don't? related news per se, I’ve experienced going Israel recently perform PCR test sampling shallow portion nose(anterior nares) vs what’s done Spain example, deepest part nose (nasopharyngeal), reliable.

And attitude people testing makes doubt even test anything, that’s paranoia. Calling required mask wearing proof vax go indoors hardly would call ""lockdown"". Sure, that's restrictive Florida, encourage spit others mouths greeting, bits hardly ""lockdown"".  start panicking now, avoid rush common cold flu. I've numerous patients come back present withe DKA, complication untreated type 1 diabetes, varying degrees Covid. ages. Swiss ain't stupid. don’t think it’s bias. lived experience uncle sadly passed away. diabetic T2, controlled. However, sick, blood sugar never came down, doctors trying lower insulin, etc, total nightmare. sugar high, body cannot heal effectively, good fighting pneumonia. Travel bans work though. using wrong definition ""work"" ""completely fix everything avoid problems"". 7 months day oh great, unfortunate enough someone called Larry, *variant* named them? think Larrys! already require PCR travellers South Africa? vaccinated? Got link sources? We're people vaccinated Onicron? ""Jumping straight extreme lockdown measures""

Maybe I've missed countries gone lockdown new variant? I've seen since Thursday/Friday bunch countries bringing international travel restrictions mostly Southern Africa. European countries lockdown went lockdown rising cases new variant identified. experience college level science likely hard time finishing semester successfully miss two full weeks middle least likely miss information may need build later. Unless unusual vulnerable unusually able mitigate effects missing 2 weeks 15 week semester probably continue attending class. like can't help yourself. hardly unfair. SA kept proclaiming one best infectious disease infrastructures world great keeping spread control, suddenly 10% two flights infected covid, either lying world things control. good reasons block incoming passengers better understanding situation. Cases HK, Holland, Germany, UK connections someone traveling Africa. count cases: see much larger count SA? 

As Delta, clearly variant came India, doubt that... no, SA blamed Delta. Beta yes, Delta. 

Also argument come SA, argument China making initial spread last year, either way shocking number passengers two flights reason alarm, irrespective SA source, clearly SA pandemic control matter keep claiming. absolutely cannot ""say that"" level certainty. zero evidence back up. Zero. 

This exactly misleading headlines neb stopped. fact believe zero evidence, many look you, huge problem. Yes, did. 98% react headline sound bite cable news concerns me. I'm political consultant DMV area—so read word ""lockdown"" headline unnerving.   I'm glad that. finally shit care team. need crystal ball? assumption drugs market go testing things like this. I’ve seen SA symptoms mild. got booster hopefully protect family, facts show right now, contagious strain symptoms mild. wish could headline. Even confusing Dutch, new = nu

“Nu variant?”

“Nee, Nu variant”

... No, we're #1 Travel restrictions make compete sense worldwide perspective, leave individual countries shoulder cost ""penalty"" acting correctly. Rewarding bad behavior countries hide outbreaks. Guaranteed print I'm buying indexes bounce bullshit? Like, seriously. happened last year. also year that. sources found, people interact somehow. initial infected person wearing one-way valve mask. I’ll take gains dip bought, hopefully. bullshit. refuse wear mask on. vaccinated apparently It’s like real lockdowns point pandemic places. People trying panic likely trying avoid change current behavior. It’s disingenuous argument. Overreaction imo asked similar question. relaxed behavior last months, I'm considering bit careful. Going back n95 masks rather surgical masks I've wearing lately. Also, reconsidering non-essential outings. Classes seem essential, unless equivalent online option? HIV common cold mutate exponentially faster, that's we've never able control them.

The problem common cold mutation rate, fact single virus. 100 different viruses cause common cold (including 4 different coronaviruses together make 15% colds). common cold much distinct disease, rather catch-all term mild upper respiratory tract infections. Unfortunately, large portion society let us. Hospitals buckling pressure unvaccinated right now.  Agreed, usually is, it’s also pretty clear vaccines outrun effectiveness population getting boosters, we’ll better shape, depending variant turns out. 

I’m least anti-vaccine. I’m vaccinated boosted. reached someone today encourage get booster. hate whole drama around it. made best risk based choice myself. Something close 80% severe cases overweight obese patients one complaining they’re overwhelming hospital system (not objectively it’s damaging health care.) I’m responsible health. everyone else. crazy flu really fucking bad. dont think wrong. Quote Guardian linked post above:

”More 80% mild disease recover, 14% severe disease including pneumonia shortness breath, 5% critical disease including respiratory failure, septic shock multi-organ failure 2% cases fatal”

Doesnt really strike underplaying covid? positive 81 year old article experienced mild symptoms omicron.

Also appeared way November 11th first sequencing date would’ve travelled origin Mozambique would see it: Unvaccinated people contracting dying rapid rates. deadly variant unvaccinated. Fauci said unvaccinated risk dying 99.7% Hello said rubbish. That's funny never locking period. treat scenario socializing unvaccinated people. Here’s article found discussing HIV South Africa COVID vaccination:
[HIV epidemic stymies COVID response Hey dumb fuck. ever say trust me? said stupid enough trust anyone masters/doctorate. anything morality. also said likely soul real life NPC. Every word worthless lifeless mouth proves that. Good luck satan. Yeah, that's lockdown dude. Also, I'm Chicago. Restaurants ""outdoor"" dining last winter. Given it’s multiple countries detected went searching think claim fully put rest None really I’m high risk didn’t drop protections. I’m likely switch back curbside store peak shopping times that’s city’s Covid dashboard already inching back forth green red. dashboard indicates positivity rates hospitalizations among things. state huge backdated data dump won’t clear indications post-holiday likely December 7. exercise caution it’s survive. can’t afford get case requires oxygen lung issues can’t afford levels risk maybe okay assuming. Sounds like hunkered, hankered. Totally different things. But.. cases mild. retracted? haven’t seen one yet. right, responding ""mostly mild cases"", ""flu-like"". I've prepared already vaccinated. Otherwise, can't isolate anymore.  I'll take whatever risk comes. impression get seriously ill COVID, COVID pneumonia takes out. didn’t think high correlation mild case COVID pneumonia Yeah, they're banning South Africa cause ya'll black!  Delta everywhere pretty quickly took months hit peak many countries. Reducing number people seeding new variant could make big impact delaying spread.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Wait getting paid it? mutation increases incubation period without reducing lethality? I’d imagine that’d give variant similar advantage Variants either disappear become dominant. seem anything between. Spring 2020, Italian D614G mutation rapidly replaced earlier Wuhan strains. winter, Alpha rapidly replace previous versions replace Delta 2021. regional variants become dominant disappeared. Thus, either Omicron becomes dominant it'll disappear.  Omicron popular Greek letter. know letters math, like pi delta, know omicron. omicron looks like circle, like Roman Oo. can't use omicron math, would confuse zero. big-oh notation like O(n lg n), say, ""oh en log en""; say, ""omicron en log en"". Amen that. stupid mutation we've opposite. case want variant take over. continues evolve seems contagious less deadly. hope ends.  Italy’s spike came later timeline. first, severity Covid really downplayed. wasn’t China started building hospitals parking lots people started take seriously. Enough flood sites anecdotes large immune evasion effect, could doesn’t transmissible delta completely overtake it? missing point. It’s perfectly fine want avoid political drama, that’s goal say so. Instead, chose outright lie it. “Xi common last name” true all. It’s lie matter look it. Dixie Oregon still social defectors. What!? haven’t deal have

No argument there, wish US county took seriously. quick travel ban actually one example evidence points mutation around awhile 

And? countries 75% cases Omnicron? Even shit testing would notice even percent cases omnicron, that’s basic statistics. would want import cases needed? makes lot sense ban travel countries high percent cases, matter are. prevents number early cases slows spread Omnicron. happening Europe I’d support ban European think government seriously considering keeping cards chest future prevent us complete economic ruin

I don’t. don’t think developed non-authoritarian country could hide this. tracing back guys hiding could lead ban duration covid. Also don’t know lot economy quick Google search shows 2019 tourism 6.9% GDP 2020 3.7%. you’re clearly exaggerating economic ruin, especially ban ends getting dropped quickly booster sucked bad second shot. cold sweats chills 2 nights row. Felt achey nauseous mornings woke up. Managed eat food take ibuprofen day, helped lot, rough. couldn’t fall asleep comfortably arm hurt far worse shot I’ve ever had. Dude, booked Christmas cruise last week. thought wow husband triple vaccinated, 6 year old fully vaccinated, everyone ship vaccinated tested, current ships many issues, bad could be? I'm wondering going one ships see news. think that? remember Italy  Better third booster, essentially another shot needed scenario I've used comparison flu long, starting feel like common cold. cure mutates frequently. know accurate is, case heck we're gonna do. Hahahahaha!!!! something free America??? want smoking problem might similar magnitude totally different. SA 24% US 59%. colossal difference. 100% it’s already here. know someone who’s parents literally came SA. I’m sure sort test not, id put money though. 

I know already contact daughter, friend, quite others. Obviously, weren’t ones flight infection rate new variant one flight 10% people infected... i’m assuming it’s spreading like wildfire.... right noses.   Look Germany Belgium’s increased cases last couple days think would fair assume similar spikes coming every country adequate testing. Unfortunately time tell us deadly variant wait see.  Oh right yeah wrote omi I'd assumed talking omnivores context thread. Good thinking  Yep. another Africa/Europe. [Currently represented sequences France/Democratic Republic seen that, US giving away anyway, yet.  I’ll happy go bar, thanks! git shots months ago... another country... get one vouchers?

Also, plane ticket Vienna? planning quarantining?  point. symptoms different Delta? easily spread…. Yes, findings studies natural immunity seems vary, severe cases providing protection going forward. submission automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* That’s I’ve trying tell everyone. Listen say follow actions. tell panic hard shutdowns fast, doesn’t really add up. I'm kinda proud least, better they've years is... shockingly aggressive. source say anything us back March 2020.   Yep. Actively putting final law school paper semester myself. bad time get booster, either, considering got initial shots already probably never will. They’re banning foreigners entering Yeah fact immediately showing allover world talks transmissibility. China refuse use non-Chinese treatments? seen hasn’t experts stoking panic. ones seen anyway saying could bad based know mutations aside don’t data say one way another yet. News websites though panicking lot more. Ohhh trifecta.  mean defend level head-in-the-sand, someone got vaccine booster soon available, become harder feel like even efforts much anything. _does_ start wear make think efforts might naught. 

Now, know look data, blatantly case, emotion always listen reason.  I’m sure world watching Israel responds this. Good luck them. Reduce seed cases. Starting 2 cases Vs starting 128 6 doublings.
 
6 doublings 128 seed cases 8000.  Uh no, Majin shit up, plain simple. 100% vax rate second available well good behaviors would likely much cohesion citizens effort, remaining careful following mandates brought potential variants etc. 

It would ""high"" amount shit. know almost two years folk accept covid base level, pretending like nothing changes outcome secret lie built, anyone everyone brain see it. personal responsibility
Sorry scares you. daily covid cases around ~100 now, compared ~20,000 summer. happening there.  going lie, double take even realize 2 different people. Genuinely thought guy hair different 2 pictures Makes sense, thank  100-ish 40 h #2 100.5-ish \~24 h #3, damn, 60 h really unfortunate.  Mater artium necessitas

Perhaps people realize inadequate government vote differently next time. 

But untill royally screw us one term course (whenever that's supposed happen, I'm sure they'll announce ""the good news"" right new ""low""). don’t think bad thing countries reacting strict regarding new variant, wish twitter/reddit would spread doom variant new. “Its serious” “this bring us back March” crowds pushing way far, still much data collect draw conclusions yet  I'll say majority news I've seen similar tone one. there's also people think *this* scare mongering. think absolutely can't win writing story covid. God's work. Wasn’t case Mu Lambda South America? largest comprehensive study issue released 2 half months ago old. Right. You’ve obviously never work peer reviewed published. 

What sources? pretty easy point out. provide them? “Now become Antibody, destroyer Covid.” Sorry evolution care tired pandemic. situation immunocompromised sensible point. immunocompromised, definitely still diligence longer sucks, however please understand longer entire population stop living life almost 2 years restrictions.

 vaccinated part tired bear burden chose part. later feel anger reason pandemic stretched, part cautious anymore. closed first wave hit original strain, large portion felt sacrificed livelihoods time believed affecting mostly elderly people, next waves changed view many longer willing sacrifice never part. around mandate. think popped cater tourists travelers get tests boarding flights.

The two times I’ve used corner testing it’s always mostly foreign tourists preparing fly home. Makes think know something os sme South Africa good job research alerting world.

Since Omicron already exported dozen countries, bound widespread already SA. suggests missed cases spread long detected it. Sarcasm? cannot denied entry country citizenship. No, that's considered presymptomatic different. spur anti vaxxers get shot touting new variant could break vaccines? double edge sword.... Got solution shutting travel? No? What's point?  People people matter country culture. media incites reactions general population, average person expects POLITICIANS something. herd mentality, already described.

Serious scientists know travel bans nothing because, time variant discovered, variant already widespread. Plus, disincentivizes countries report variants, fear stigmatized.  never much need ""find"" new one. 

Expect new variant announced every time run excuses. High time people start wearing actual good masks (n95, kn95) floating around months basically everywhere, actually good sign. really understand went awry comprehension what's going branch comments, spent much time barking tree even there.

But imply *other people* ones wasting time...idk man.  drug companies cannot lie

It’s lying, rhetoric write reports way pressure governments buying boosters

Their goal make billions selling products, savimy governments money scared Unicron variant, I'm scared Omega Shenron variant. bro. 7 people got addition 1 reported yesterday, 4 unvaccinated aborad, 3 travel vaccinated. 
That's good sign least. mean riskiest? Risk contraction possible due occupation/lifestyle. Risk serious complications still low. 

I run operation employs 45 “kids,” call them, 17-22/23. group predominately vaccinated (90+%, best knowledge it’s one person medical exemption.) observation delta made way community also staff. 50% “kids” symptomatic cases last 2.5 months. None severe means. Coincidentally internal conversations well utter curiosity determined cases came family spread, predominately younger siblings bringing home school, also little severity. 

To best understanding observation vaccines working designed. One cases lives grandma, 94, 2x vaxxed boosted she’s risk. positive symptomatic cases limited severity. 

I can’t wrap head around 17 year old getting boosted anything community spread severity would imply such. [I make  diversity chances mutations... That's widely researched various studies. say vaccination 6 months covid best protection someone may acquire. early primer that, refer ""hybrid immunity"". Also, similar note, researchers messed psudovirus similar sars2 reach point could possibly evade current vaccines says findings similar Omicron. However, studies, thing neutralized infected vaccinated serum. Hopefully 3 doses vaccine same.  There’s convincing US government tends find way doesn’t require comes foreign matters.  Fucking BTS. Oh well, blame people wanting derive enjoyment last years planet. I’m sure follow idea it’s around months? First case sequenced dates back two weeks, would give time naturally plane hopped spread around couple contacts out, fits we’re seeing? 

Obviously hope you’re right, ball ache. Definitely watching approach 6 month mark vaccination. Debating going ahead booster vs waiting find it'll even cover strain. It’s interesting watch speculate right there’s little good information variant. steps countries (Israel think currently extreme position) taken makes seem likely variant pretty concerning.

I’d like think leaders trying proactive, honestly think banning foreigners entry isn’t kind thing you’d unless pretty good idea things might bad.

On hand, maybe heads state really desperate seem like they’re something. knows. interesting find weeks overreaction really looking something massively different we’ve seen far. Fair comment.

All eyes SA hospitalisation data. Yup.

I'm reasonably sure I'm typing scientists either collecting, cultivating, and/or dumping load Omicron petri dish see effective existing antibody's neutralizing new strain.

That'll (probably) first data I'll put amount faith outside community study's (But still lack context much contagious deadly strain is) Let guys seriously figured COVID thing ends world kills us all? example car accident totally logical fallacy even know start. better would lol really sobering see much we’ve screwed think major challenges face us face us future, like climate change. Scientists generally done great job pandemic, course- there’s weird contrast amazing, Apollo-like successful effort get vaccine year refusal millions take vaccine. It’s it’s always been, guess. species capable amazing things, time, large numbers people always behave poorly. capable great progress great failures. tension two really made clear pandemic. Snap mandatory shops public areas won’t. Spoiler alert it’s already everywhere. number cases detected directly correlated **regional sequencing capabilities**.  fuck mandating quarantine?! It’s shit like makes step back go “hmm, maybe morons something intentional.” submission removed either repost, clickbait low quality submission. Please review sub's rules, particularly rules 3, 5, 6.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Depends risk tolerance want see Omicron really made of. It’s still air point we’ll find weeks. Personally thrill seek ways I’d get booster, given limited downsides. first covid article read like 6 months though(fully taxed pro mask). skipped straight NPR bc want waste time garbage. think people like lol. wish dad would 🤭 Sure. it’s initial infection invades it’s still alarming since thing ever really concerned hospitalization / death.  vaccines continue block doesn’t change much last week bought tickets London mid December, first work trip two years. country five days I’m going assume means won’t going now. What’s alternative, exactly? 

There’s cost-benefit analysis society whole requires us make decisions can’t possibly perfect everyone. 

Like said person, kids excluded schools family predetermined time? COVID zero never happening. tell kids go get fucked?

It’s impossibly shitty situation. long not? even need ask question  I've also done same. I'm also still staying responsible. sucks, hey, whether like not. thing. probably everybody's too. Like current vaccines ineffective new train, shitty time again.

Especially countries vaccine producers like mine Canada. Everybody re-vaccinated. Yeah take new vaccines widely available countries. citizens poorer countries even gotten first shot ... leaves potential new variants pop. 

This shit never ending circle.  Great, Covidmass 2021 did. spread stuff faster. also antivax sentiment (justifiably since one fucked like native Americans) Yea, makes sense. catch break already! Fack covid one especially so, understand it. would park Buick middle room? (If get joke, old) foresee complete travel bans and/or return mandatory 14 day quarantine policy post travel. 

Both policies completely failed curb spread previous variants (alpha, delta) - mention original COVID - sure let's try again, maybe 4th time's charm. 

If Omicron 5X contagious delta suggested, thought prevent going global laughable. solution always vaccines - question current vaccines sufficient need adapt variant. Maybe household contacts travellers? That’s exactly feels like. forgotten. I’m lucky work home. immunocompromised people can’t? Probably need give disability. lot societal trauma original Wuhan outbreak, nobody really believes fatality numbers experience, it’s clear whatever actually happened shook CCP it’s core. 50 sci fi, I'm surprised already tired [Q's Wasn’t 5 times last week? We’ve gone like 100x 3x lol  Pfizer said 100 days shots arms.  bet neededavodka2020 well 🤭  Well that's happened school closed march 2020, hear scream unfair was, understood needed.

Because cannot see family, mean families vaxed safe can't see solidarity someone know never meet. 
If family fullt vaxxed still refuse see them, that's you. Definitely Florida Texas right cautious. look India last April, new VoC. think aware able deal Delta/Omicron spreads wild. things - capable outcompeting delta(Theoretically!). Mutations thing we've built vacienes around (spike protein - helps get ew) might render less effective. Less info outcomes various demographics. Might another elderly nightmare, one us. early say hopefully raised transmissibility comes lowered mortality rate. selective pressure done lead time infection, sumptoms death, feels like genetic wall spaff. So... fuck knows?  parents immunocompromised like me, would let kids see them? would hope safety.

I don’t need empathy. need people comply rules vaccinations. need stricter mandates. Mostly seemed men 30s 40s saw difficult know anecdotally. Fully vaccinated people dying original strain, alpha,beta, delta etc. 

More data needs come declare anything (good bad) confidence levels. bunch comments blaming people HIV. 

Is reason suspect happened among people HIV vs. say, larger population people SA vaccinated all? sort bigotry? Could humans develop less lethal version Covid, higher transmissibility, lab release across public, stop current variants? 


Apologies dumb question. obviously possible, would political armageddon. hear you. feel like version “I got mine; don’t matter”. Maybe booster study Phase 3 substudy, conducted 306 participants ≥18 55 years age, showed vaccine well tolerated second primary dose elicited immune responses (SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralizing titers) wild-type 1 month third dose non-inferior immune responses observed 1 month second primary dose, meeting protocol pre-specified success criteria GMTs seroresponse rates. Immunology complicated me. know mutations affect memory cells react virus.

There's 20x things probably idea about.

If there's change spike protein, change affect antibodies attack it. know already conditioned antibody able affext protein mutated?

Wouldn't better mix mutated protein mrna?

Or stable part spike protein can't change all, vaccine specifically designed attack unchanging part?

I ask questions expert, people knowledge, experts answer questions, people understand anything immunology. article literally titled “we know almost nothing omicron” - hard say that’s fear mongering.  Half Reddit hasn’t changed routine all, consisted sitting home playing video games every weekend evening.  copied pasted exact response somewhere else. Word word read yesterday. read Vagina initially confused.  

Enjoy! would much better US shared whatever everyone. Two cases new Omicron coronavirus variant also detected southern German state Bavaria Italy, neighbours Switzerland, Switzerland thus far imposed travel restrictions countries shares borders. 

LOL bad policy also stupidly applied. kids weren’t talking about. she’s missing learning, feel there. rest though? Nah. empathy. don’t get see family friends either. can’t. get nothing there. probably weeks virus.  _ｐｅｄａｎｔｉｃ_ sorry, entitled sacrifice like family done part 18months+ indefinite amount time.
We vaxxed danger others, refuse get vax wear mask indoor public spaces problem. Even vaccine 100% get breakthrough case (again someone unvaxxed spread someone else) pull ressource already strained hospitals
I one life, children deserve see family fulfilled allow anyone tell sacrifice well being. Honestly wear N95 mask careful around people. reuse masks bake em. caught covid two years masking regularly. foresee complete travel bans and/or return mandatory 14 day quarantine policy post travel. point, policy changes happening quickly could matter hours dominoes fall Comments like warn China propaganda time sound like propaganda itself. weird. Depends mean mRNA tech.

mRNA discovered long time ago. mRNA replication around decades.

The nanolipid coatings packaging machines new. clinically, approved mRNA products market, numerous trials started 2019, mostly cancer treatments.

But live carrier vaccine tech years older. first clinical product approved Ebola vaccine 2019.  still haven’t even discovered Covid19 started!  Perfectly fine better different. R0 3 better 2. right, hard. new booster least 100 days out, probably ok terms waiting period. still need right PCR assay variant-specific primers. article: “The one good news, there’s good news, variant, B.1.1.529, detected **one particular PCR assay**”

Believe me, someone literally PCR living: standard qPCR test tell variant not. Yes, enough mutations design primers specifically pick up, without need full genome sequencing. still need looking it. easy cheap, looking, find it. Exactly.  Yes!!! No, I’m Saskatchewan, Canada, health care system almost collapsed fully opened summer. 

We fly patients Ontario, country’s provincial capital, Sask emergency departments can’t ICU patients *hallways*.

I don’t know Eric Ding is. Good luck, friend. mental health bad. wish health. still get booster. take months anything new rolled out, don’t know even needed. Good point BNO news getting first track ultimate troll move. feels like start pandemic. hate it. google eric topol twitter. low vaccination rate, low baseline Delta, meaning whatever variant took hold next wave would quickly become dominant. likely founder effect needs disentangling increased transmissibility, virulence etc Omicron. could well bit both. Again, know yet. 'laments'

its layman's terms.

the worrisome aspect could dodge antibodies previous infections vaccines.

what unknown lethal/severe is. Damn sucks, heart goes you. I'm serious want whatever takes get it, I'm mission lol. ya, already hermit years experience ab anti social mf, outlast muahahaha  plans distance mask . global standards, Germany low vaccination rate, compare rich, Western European countries, Germany remarkably badly.  Exponential growth starts slow ramps up. country like US sequenced 5% (it sequencing around 2% march) cases day started 1-5 cases daily new variant could realistically take weeks months catch variant there. Countries would sequence almost cases catch variants early enough stop  Yes, Denmark actually cares catching variants. smart though? lockdown something used flippantly start somewhere. We’ve already seen nothing leads to. Science says ""We know"" &amp; still claiming moral high-ground here. *Explain works, again?* Good. Closing border entirely way works. Selectively banning certain countries nothing. CHISE PLUSHIES!?!?!?!?! comes availability care resources: beds staff. everyone love vaccinated, really mind open floodgates forget masks vaccine checks. 

But stop think: let guard, anti-vaxxers clog hospital beds, huge liability vaccinated person may need kind care. coworker who'd chronic pain months elective surgery canceled summer, hospitals overwhelmed. Let’s go Brandon Would really mattered were?.. Especially they're wearing basic surgical cloth masks taking eat provided snacks drinks foot away stranger they've sitting next hours. would expect places NYC would already begun reviewing previous PCR data search missing gene tests preemptive effort find potential cases around.

Has anyone heard anything done? Seems like pretty easy cheap way get general idea far. That's right. That's reality Polio wasn't. 

Small pox wasn't. 

Those two big examples everyone references Lmao yes! excellent. I’m concerned sad lives people fine indefinitely living life without events, restaurants, social gatherings, conventions, in-person classes, etc.  sure mean? pretty pointless trying stop it. benefit closing borders etc try slow spread coincide winter flu surge (if even possible), somewhat legitimate tactic, simply delaying inevitable Wait final product vaccine instead beta-testing version. People would scared smallpox, due changes appearance infected.  can’t find life worth living without superspreader concerts I’m concerned sad life Please. can't take much virus ultimately demise

A little sensationalist, think? Covid going bring doom humanity, unless implying apocalyptic virus show future. Christmas fun. Post Thanksgiving USA interesting.  are. think people downplaying it, think we're distinct danger going way. I've seen least 3 people, likely areas rising delta infections mean infection distinct risk booster wise, asking wait getting booster they've heard omicron, even sera neutralization studies yet, completely resistant vaccines. accurate say concerning indicators also lot information making definitive statements point. data available seems slim. I'm really surprised *entire world* reacting quickly. Jesus Christ. That's really extreme. Millions dead, least people demonize news. Instead capitalist systems failed (and incentivize doom news business model) Hotel quarantine international arrivals stopped NSW vaccination rates hit pre-defined target. I'm entirely sure Victoria ACT imagine less same. Gotta get sweet, sweet clicks Yes. place PCR testing identify cases according WHO, interesting see local spread. That's way see it, point go back pragmatic cannot keep restrictions part, literally nothing help anymore, lockdowns closures hurting average joe, either financially mentally. 

Tell it, 2020 kids remote learning, son well, however daughter IEP lost significant learning still dealing results closures learning today. long want sacrifice daughter's learning future? sacrificed enough make happy? Sure one cared either closed schools! Asking prolong point tools longer take extreme measures used tools realistic. Like said, portion population done everything could. Idk solution take care half, minute talk mandate met ""we becoming dictatorship!!"" Overreaction....

I kept fairly cautious longer due kids got eligible vaccine, first months school full day person stressful good management district went well thankfully. However hear complain children free people fully vaxxed done could back normal live. 

A large part population sacrificed, forced lose livelihood, major set backs, health mental problems protect weakest year vaccine available all, longer children still unprotected. welcome. trust anything China says. Oh no

That means pandemic last eight years even though enough virus one-year pandemic :(  Should, wont really. current 4th wave extra high still many idiots convince people get vaxxed... Also politicians declared end pandemic restrictions earlier. we're completely fucked.
The new variant new yet responsible big peak right now. still pretty sure already place, however still small numbers.  person either old well connected get second vaccine 9 months ago Austria. That’s true, depends get information from. US government isn’t aware new virus it’s characteristics individual scientists governments around world (more South Africa’s understanding virus first detected) able study coming conclusion significant mutation (roughly 35 mutations) 500% contagious already contagious delta variant. mutations omicron variant share similar mutations variants associated highly contagious vaccine resistant. Takes time make stuff Prudent, considering known unknown.  Since boarder south wide open surprise popular variant US. man imprisoned spreading omnivirus They'll cave eventually tbh. Covid going anywhere like avatar knows Omicron already U.S. Everyone knows it. he’s stop strain. knows well. restrictions coming show, make people feel like he’s least trying. make people like comment things like lol Yes, eventually, die. matter time. case even covid. Sinopharm 68.7% effective stopping infection, Pfizer sits 83.3% Moderna 88.7% - alpha, infer info delta this, too. given much even small difference vaccinated population matters delta, vaccine effectiveness works way, might end fun.

source: [recent [reddit mentioned minute ago another one comments. 

No. People get vaccinated. it’s absurd honest conversation can’t science. surprising think COVID-19 subside think people continue wear masks afterwards. don’t morbidly obese guess got booster day Thanksgiving...should waited. Reading lines lost art (and confused conspiracy theory). It’s preparation, prevention survival.  It’s exactly fact DON’T exactly know severe virus they’re extra cautious they’re able reach conclusion. [Hey everybody! we're gonna get laid! doubt there'll massive amounts old cases found honestly think nearly contagious making (I've heard people say 500% contagious delta absurd). It'll likely follow trend exponential growth meaning it'll slow weeks months becomes real problem becomes real problem (by point, hopefully tweaked vaccines way they're needed). still possible delta remains dominant variant countries spreading large scale  


There's absolutely cause concern really think thing insane people media making yet let lots vaccines EXPIRE antivax idiots US. I'm fucking pissed Precautionary principle would say close border now. There’s Klepper interview asks guy vaccine claims won’t take developed fast asks trump’s operation warp speed expedite vaccine production praises saving millions lives. used think people memory it’s far worse. don’t perceive cognitive dissonance. It’s forget views recently (although well), it’s hold antithetical opinions simultaneously without realizing least without bothering all. risk severe disease 17 year old 2 shots already exceedingly low.

The main benefit giving boosters youngish people reduce spread community, reducing likelihood infection elderly. Fascinating work. Thank contributing something important. Sorry hear you’ll miss Christmas. 🎄❤️ also possible could transmittable lethal.

Or less transmittable lethal.

Or less transmittable less lethal.

At point, know, anything's table, right? think Israel generally chosen aggressive. it’s nothing, that’s fine, taking precautionary principle seriously. Exactly!!!!! tired pipe dream causes millions deaths. Worldwide!!!! point quarantines mandates easy make drug unavailable intellectual propierty? nobody see control point? like third summat variant we've gone through, they're going keep adding keep us living fear.

And no, I'm antivaxxer, I'm speaking fully vaccinated person. No. 16 studies found natural immunity stronger vaccination. 2 published CDC saying opposite outliers. 

Natural immunity, recorded history virology, considered effective vaccinations. 

That doesn’t mean people shouldn’t get vaccine. doesn’t mean someone try get virus instead getting vaccinated. 

It means natural immunity provides protection. That’s it. always going get Greek letter identified variant concern.

Not sure Nu think Xi skipped political reasons.  Except doesn’t sequenced noticed. one good news, there’s good news, variant, B.1.1.529, detected one particular PCR assay,” de Oliveira said news conference, meaning diagnostic labs quickly identify new Moderna never played games half dose bullshit.

Withholding results 50 vs 100 study going look even shadier now.   FML stupid ass sitting Disney breaking news headline Omicron popped up... major crowds 2 years. Got talked last minute everyone around saying finally ""safe"" go out. Stupid MSM encouraging everyone last two weeks NORMAL Thanksgiving....and did.

Flying back home state tomorrow bring new variant me....

Got booster 3 weeks ago. Potentially six months ago. cases asymptomatic. vaccine provides limited protection infection delta six month (hence need boosters). agree takeaway studies get vaccinated right? aren’t pushing narrative correct? It’s easy spot doesn’t need sequencing. spotted gene drop PCR want scare everyone It’s able detected PCR test. place like UK Israel would picked sure. true. prediction lot young males vaccinated Monday’s least one entirely asymptomatic There's 13 17 Delta People either really like hate it. Contrary fear-mongering, relatively sane here. weather, though. many mutations variant previous variants, previously identified potentially increasing infectiousness decreasing antibody effectiveness. yet enough evidence variant behave. CDC conspiring hide anything \[redacted\] uncover anything.

Don't assert this, let assert contrary feel like let burden proof, since making extraordinary claim. also equal myocarditis. 

""Viral myocarditis also equal vaccine-induced myocarditis."" let context quote make seem like advocating 1 + 1 = 3. likely counter can't possibly know 5 year death rate vaccine-induced myocarditis anyway. fuck gets plane symptomatic right now?

At point, I'd shocked symptomatic person willingly chose get plane. I'd expect fight tooth nail get on, shrieking rights something. variant unusual large amount mutations. 28 compared 10 Delta variant

What mutations dont know. Scientists raised alarm could mean virus lot different.

That plus appears spread fast 

But really know yet.  Except plenty countries sequence strains ongoing basis, precisely keep track new ones. saying things simply supported current evidence. idiots.  I'm afraid good sir. afraid they'll close borders ruin trip. That's way going f go called B11what-ever Nu variant Omicron 12 hours virus keep stealing names promising techno DJs? people almost exterminated due part denialism, learn take decisive action early. Isn’t viruses widely spread tend evolve? Shift towards equilibrium. know this, how? lie someone long covid symptoms way share medical group? pcp didn’t even know covid told looked back charts. wish official repository.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*   That’s Delta. take breather. ❤️ lethal, lower opportunity spread. kill somebody 6 hours, can't go shopping. I’ve seen movie :(  January vaccines given elderly (and rich). Alpha variant dangerous younger people either. really skews graphs. least twits essentially donated vaccine poorer countries.  theory also supposes Johannesburg origin, literally know. Could Mozambique origin one group infected split Joburg Moz. literally know.  Christmas, New Years, Valentines Day, Saint Patrick's day. also people think walking around contagious possibly deadly virus normal thing do, without negative consequence. Omicron probably already US. Air travel restrictions drop bucket. Would surprise spreads Europe Netherlands, take serious cos believed enough vaccinated, would surprise new variant would come Netherlands soon already.

You tired measures wont make virus go away, argue fight want, stay long taken serious potential ignored time. LMAO nah. yall paying attention much dick people give inch. muh phreedumz Well, let’s hope they’re right. Meanwhile, let’s take cautious approach. get everywhere. It’s Israel, be. enough evidence suggest vaccines do/don't work it.  severity illness it’s causing? high number mutations definitely incredibly unlikely. Delta already way worse dominant variants likely going get worse. Everybody panic! gonna Europeans coming shared terminal restaurant Africans. thoughts simply cautious - case. far come vaccine-wise would risk come undone stop/slow gather data. like shutting windows morning go work chance rain. Last time listen forecast carpets ruined. care 100% effective tbh...N95's quite effective know them. yet see study cloth masks much anything. (5% nothing).

That said, take chances surviving vaccines. masking rest life delay catching virus everyone catch eventually. knows, good chance already exposed even notice.  Covid, intelligence test. failed. least aircraft good filtration systems. I'm never going public transit like buses trains without mask. Ah see. telegraph also reporting story, think truth it. people still debate natural immunity better.

Joe Rogan fucked us. Ah Zimbabwe Gambit, nice infected mushroom course. meant countries know look list countries variant already grow substantially. said that? certainly didn't. ToI fairly marked pro-BJP nationalist bias, terrible Indian standards. said exactly reliable either. rule thumb, can't find source that's ToI, story's probably true all. Yep terms missing variants fewer one would think people know Greek alphabet least Delta picking steam colder parts US. looking ok US south right knows things go next couple months. came ask exact question. Israel closed borders foreign travelers. What's going here? Feels like 18 months ago world said, ""let's wait see"", China locked whole cities sanitized streets using huge trucks. Narrator: “It didn’t.” 4. study single massive outlier every study (and there's many) reached opposite conclusion.

Yet antivaxxers continue spamming single preprint like conclusive.  Maybe know know. goal keep Omicron country possibility, already spread many countries. danger Omicron still unclear, precaution till know more. Interesting - article linked says 40% got number. long weekend bet would heard confirmed cases US already paying taxes learning drive getting behind wheel. Yes area makes big difference compliance. feel like west LA lot people wear mask. Glendale area much less use bathtub That’s actually funny yeah far vaccine seems working, wait bit see that’s case sure mean, like vaccine?

a vaccine infectious:) world wait long for, talking waiting again? Looks like Christmas back menu boys people infected Delta Omikron time? South Africa 24.1% vaccinated two doses.  

28.7% partially vaccinated one dose. anyone explain country fucking dumb? can’t wrap head around it. Countries find variant Thursday start shutting flights ramping testing procedures. country do? “We shut flights Monday continue monitor situation.” Oh, that’s right. virus week visiting family thanksgiving. way it’ll get US Monday. JFC. country would fuck wet dream. convenient reality aligns facts science (and liberals) 

Funny works huh believe evidence N=1 studies, except contradicts ""divinely inspired"" tenets shared belief system. ..Okay? thousands businesses every day. rest planet supposed give shit one restaurant NY? Lots people got vaccinated Delta wave. first sequenced November 9th really enough time kill anyone yet.

it mostly likely around long sequencing. I’m due moderna booster. wait omicron vax? people part L.A. comply it. saw one person without mask yesterday store. say word I'm small older female guy almost assaulted grocery store last year (came arm up, fist clenched) asked pull mask up. maskless people violent assholes looking fight. agree also another reason. CCP hurry open China. believe actually prefer status quo sense. In- outbound travel tightly controlled, there's barely 'meddling' foreigners countries/NGO's/academia much harder time figuring China's internal affairs.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  long covid symptoms have? Indeed. husband got type 1 33. Passed away 40. family history autoimmune issue allergic alcohol found college called Stephens Johnson syndrome. Doctors thought could virus made beta cells pancreas stop working. always skinny made go ER stop peeing time could see bones skin. thought type 2 first since skinny people get type 2 fat people. There's new studies linking vitamin deficiency type 2 along parathyroid. surprised since live indoor culture use sunscreen. Dermatologist always saying stay sun endocrinologist say get sun. people get sick weeks doubt getting much sun seen lot articles covid vit deficiency outcomes. Stills need research taking multivitamin highly recommended check doctor since much certain vitamins also cause similar issues getting enough I’m Shelfishness ppl. thanks! stock market move delta variant discovered. 

Oil move much either.

We also ban travel meaningful way delta found.

This time around oil dropped 11% one day. Thats huge.

The stock market sold broadly, meaning sold everything. rotate another sector, sold everything.

Countries banning travel time.

This doctors patients could 25 years old perfect health. thats case course symptoms would mild.

Listen wall street doctor. skin game doctor does. Asymptomatic “serious case” ? really hope someday virus mutates version doesn’t cause anosmia manifest delayed parosmia.

I tought Delta symptoms didnt include loss smell anymore, cass? I'll take covid getting beaten mob criminals badges time. Dont need read foreign press, Dutch media blew proportion. went work (we got strict covid protocol ) Friday everyone panicking like it’s end world. Maybe weren’t affect media many people around me. end it’s opinion witnessed myself, could different you. put prespective, 30 confirmed new cases variant plane Amsterdam. data indicates vaccination produces far immunity time.

Not true. Studies show protection reinfection strong persists 10 months vaccine safer way *acquire* immunity, studies show natural immunity least strong as, stronger than, vaccine immunity. Genomic testing positive samples routinely (not nearly enough though) would check matches known genomic epidemiology Omicron. post indicate COVDI test still work Omicron, course tell variant. already Delta specific boosters original one well enough they’re waste. fact, may luckier used Delta specific one Omnicron similar original strain Delta, per virologist types. BBC proposing anything, reporting South Africa said.  So, looks like moderation removed recent thread another Redditor due edited title (and commented I'll add anyone chime others might educate and/or inform others)...

Article: interesting article gives us glimpse happening South Africa ways always see reported elsewhere.

One interesting item found article studies show reproduction rate 2 — meaning every person infected likely spread two people.**

My understanding basic reproductive number Delta ranged around 3 8 mean around 5 (although may depend data source). 

Internal documents CDC (and revealed NYTimes others summer months) suggested 8-9 rivaled contagiousness chickenpox mumps (and numbers informed Public Health England Imperial College London). Furthermore, understanding thatthose documents whowed Alpha/Beta/Epsilon around 3ish original Coronavirus 2.5ish.

I'm expert reproductive rates general (e.g. number may change time different settings vaccinated versus unvaccinated) - curious reported rate much lower compared Delta others yet mutations indicate may transmissible.

It understanding South Africa somewhere around 40% vaccinated currently.

I'm probably missing something experts (or informed persons) want chime I'd appreciate help understanding piece information. countries act slow also It’s late, omicron already everywhere. see It'll overtake delta. far least symptoms aren’t severe vaccinated  Unfortunately year ago probably highest level opening felt, since last winter’s multiple local outbreak, Delta, policy become tighter tighter, it’s impossible get many places without 48 hours PCR test, even places without COVID weeks, various level lockdowns affecting millions happens weekly since July

Do mistake, obviously much better US, least comparable best developed countries hemisphere, I’m worrying strategy sustainable, investment measures actually stops potential improvements fields health care, China still pretty much lagging behind average life expectancy. Right, hence word “assume”. Google best mean useful way. Yes, two cases confirmed Australia (returned SA) asymptomatic.

Obviously two significant number. Israel reported believe we'll wait see. Need data.  strange. wonder everyone line knew getting mystery vaccine. leaves bleeding pustules face. That's that's needed really something disgusting that's actually visible. clearly dieing grandparents parents enough call action. Roughly 100% cases Johannesburg flew Omicron, remainder Delta.  safe assume others Omicron. I'm vaccines, one, gut feeling telling no, im updated everything except covid shot. Something sit right me.. Another curious fact outside Wuhan, China, home first big outbreak, infected individuals weren’t immediately causing exponential local outbreaks, says Endo, one earliest quantify phenomenon.

This uneven, sputtering form transmission, individuals infect many people infect few, any, shared coronavirus’s cousins — SARS-CoV, caused deadly epidemic severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 2003, MERS-CoV, source Middle East respiratory syndrome. similar mode transmission occurs pathogens cause Ebola, smallpox unvaccinated? point know answer. one does. They've begun studying variant, impossible say vaccine picture look like 3, 4, 5 months. may need booster, may not. good conjecture it. Furthermore, FDA/CDC handled booster rollout particularly well, behind curve every step way. doubt really know yet, masks probably help least extent. course, higher-quality masks like N95s probably help more.

See (news article) (scientific paper). course pre-Omicron. Source? places allow antigen testing within 72 hrs a) might see omicron b) effective asymptomatic cases c) might much window trip get COVID test.

Anecdotally, got COVID testing site 😔 challenge is, variant 500 percent transmissible original, flood already strained ICUs already short staffed. greatly impact people issues i.e. strokes, heart attacks, kidney failure, etc. unrelated COVID.

It's also possible variant could mild vaccinated, fatal unvaccinated. Time tell. maybe actually taking virus seriously works. seems like that’s never occurred Reddit. explanation China lying media fear mongering gets clicks problem. It’s lot. website super easy explore, navigate, read, learn. It’s true treasure. wish people would share it.  Essentially they're saying accept anything. Every item list checked they're still saying no. Even Donald Trump encouraged vaccination. literally nothing point time change minds. didn’t really mutate something less serious. means vaccines work muting seriousness. South Africa 60% urban seroprevalence going Delta wave. Delta wave worst yet, raising deaths around 50%. old people got vaccinated (28% population first dose) mostly let run. 0.5% South Africa died COVID. Delta also died out.

It's likely Johannesburg 85% population immunity, Mumbai. Even small amount immune escape (and Omicron nearly every antibody binding point changed amount small) would give Omicron dramatic rate spread. Yes. new variant could undo everything achieved. Yes. nut jobs right? We’re expected get covid shots every time told order work, travel, etc. wtf Can’t split difference Japan Australia? low deaths, functioning democracy. :{ Everyone panicking, know enough mutation yet, precautions necessary. Westminster thing everywhere soon. London massive air, rail road hub UK (in case air, world). cluster London could seed UK quickly. would worry much, seeing nightmares Mig parts nukes raining since forever nothing happened.  Yeah getting scary.

When booked flight everything looking hopeful, we're slowly getting afraid might cancel flight.

I hope much issue, first time almost year partner finally see friends family longer lives home country vacation would home country. might possibly last chance seeing family members well.

=

Things like travel restrictions like absolutely detrimental people live, work study abroad. hope thing happen, even would require extra extensive testing traveling. Even normal vaccines like polio measles lot resistance many communities including US, large parts Middle East large parts Africa. Africa largely spared death rates continents seen plus issues transportation isolation, seems incredibly unlikely going get uptake vaccination necessary prevent immunocompromised people catching extremely contagious virus. Large chunks Africa already natural
immunity didn’t stop spread either. also made statement young healthy people (probably vaccinacted im sure). seems like delta variant, infectious  variants then? Sorta getting burnt this. Also mostly Triple Pfizer vaccinated population. mean… companies developed vaccines major variants. case, original vaccine worked well one hasn’t required spin production new vaccine. might required case, it’s worth framing “needed” yet. significant percentage infected vaccinated hence concern 50 mutations Misleading headline. Omricon reason quite right. Israel banned incoming outgoing want come back air traffic. Add capacity manufacturers. end real problem yet vaccine requires cold chain, leaving poorest areas planet without vaccine access. - high amount mutations could lead evading protections
- quickly spreading ([Graph showing early tell severe  got booster last Saturday. Definitely symptoms 2. Felt bad part Sunday Monday. Better Tuesday. back normal soon. headlines came Delta started circulating, one panic.  Lockdowns work minute they're implemented. shot, said, takes weeks. time innoculate millions. already struggling germany administer boosters risk groups vaccination sites closed half GPs didint vaccinate either. Even everyone yet vaccinated suddenly decideded get vaccinated capacity. Additionally vaccine sceptics even antivaxx wont decide take shot timeframe.

Drosten said vaccinating not-yet-vaccinated medium term solution, boostering longterm solution thing helping short term contact reductions. boosters population wide effect also need 30+ millions. opinion. opinion shared lot scientists, e.g. academic group Cool, anti-vaxxers shit everything consequences. Lovely. omicron mutated enough evades vaccines, wouldn’t delta omicron circulate together. would omicron “replace” delta. different enough couldn’t theoretically get infected both? realise people family loved ones seen 2 years lot cases right?

Are really going say vaccinated people allowed travel again? worst case Omicron quite bad, that's making people panic. entirely cannot rule contagious Delta, partial immune evasion, kills 10% people (1% breakthroughs reinfections).

But best case like swine flu, actually pretty probable. people think Omicron originated Laundrie flower bed fear vaccines, ‘long term side effects’? can’t imagine losing friend horrible way think, ‘nahhhh, I’m good.’    anecdotal still,

Yes one confirmed case Israel sure anecdotal.. would suggest priority system patients vaccination status. 

So, willfully unvaccinated adult vaccinated adult competing ICU bed, goes vaccinated individual even means moving unvaccinated person ward receive palliative care (so, like heavy painkiller drip prevent suffering) longer pressure ICU. I'm less harsh views regarding kids, many places parental permission needed get jabs want punish unvaccinated kid anti-vax parents. USA virtually adult able get vaccines/boosters many months would say kind priority system way go keep ICUs getting overwhelmed. ""but start smokers, fat people, alcoholics, others made poor choices etc."" folks show weigh (cause know coming)... come back talk alcoholics smokers etc. overwhelming ICUs. now, temporarily, keeps medical system running Covid surges need prioritizing people could help avoid overwhelming it. fact is, got booster today, you’re stuck one. You’ll expected hunker house eligible next shot. 

Repeat infinity Omicron isn’t deadlier Delta, still par it, could still really bad, considering looks significantly contagious. Delta alone already hurting lot hospitals. Delta, contagious, could spell disaster place like, say, Michigan. Hey /u/LadyEm8 please clarify post title indicate UNVACCINATED 20-30 year olds hospitalized? Israel say symptom mild, proceed ban entry foreigners. 360 degree turn, least right start, rather panic lockdown.  get heart inflammation diagnosed? symptoms? anti-CCP, know CCP seperate everything, banned Winnie Pooh bit, atrocities Uyghurs, eating away Indian territory, taking Asian sea social credit system.

Had 1 child policy backfired done alot stuff, apologize aint pro CCP. hate American governemnt to, least people complain people see shit is.

Yes way containment effective, official numbers laughable likely. Writing speeches difficult painstaking, done well. time.

He 100% reviewed approved it, though. already know amino acid substitutions b.1.351 (Beta) plus bunch one unknown impact. means yes, taking possibility immune evasion seriously using language induce panic confirm suspicions solution already hand. Oh, it’ll get approved sometime late spring, available masses mid-summer, variant mostly died off? 

Cool. Generally speaking video games great thing cite discussion virology. game game, ""congrats infected everyone, nobody died occasionally get mild fever night keep passing around"" kind ""meh"" game concept. 

""Success,"" evolution-speak basically ability continually, successfully reproduce. intelligent semi-intelligent creatures produces things like humans looking compatible spouses, bucks fighting best mate with. Intentional actions specific goals mind. virus intelligent standard, instead spins occasional variation random might happen better reproducing.

So virus lethal, especially kills quickly, less time reproduce less opportunity spread hosts, interfere fundamental biology imperative trying reproduce more. flu worldwide problem every single year, develop new flu vaccine address specific emergent strands shift change.

There's theoretical world supervirus existing asymptomatic contagious, long asymptomatic period, basically guaranteed fatal time symptoms show. Like dangerous rabies spread asymptomaticly. viruses capable designing towards specific ends, fortunately nothing evolved nightmare scenario human history.  know Brandon Stark came mind reading comment. We're chilling lol Meanwhile Chief Medical Officer Moderna said suspects new variant least partially vaccine resistant. team began process prepping tweaked vaccine Thursday, planning Omicron vaccine March 2022. African countries though. Remember detected South African scientists, necessarily mean originated there. comment correctly removed. Please familiarize high quality rule. Thanks. agree. got booster knocked flat three days. Careful say Omicron less severe point. People hoping would case Delta first well. look forward time Sars-cov-2 fatality rate 0.01% people younger 40. that, got 10 cases country, want become 100 within days borders open. need give time. hey lived too. what's sense people think border quarantining go? people walk around fear stuff gonna hit fan? borders closed year, recently reopened, close unprofessional opinion, since little loss taste smell Omicron patients heard far, seems like damage brain much less - one common lasting effects long COVID. also personally one scariest effects me. seems like could less concern  Boosters. I'd say like 1 30 first dose. Longer incubation could (and complete guess) mean milder disease. Delta shorter incubation period hit harder alpha wild type. course, curious first we’re hearing hospitalizations. Omicron arrives China maybe cannot contain it, even drastic measures. 24% South Africa’s population fully vaccinated, doesn’t give us full picture would countries vaccination rate much higher. We’re still going wait see Omicron responds vaccines. Vaccinated people slow community spread boosting masking. Trust me, lot help others many won’t even that.  Like Valentines Day screaming fewer orgasms. least person eaten. article red color categorized mutation concerning were. lot red. 

But yeah. I’m trying resist drawing early conclusions. planning travel Republican run state Christmas. means mask usage lot angry people get information unreliable sources. 

Omicron good news. figured kids finally got vaccinated, things would get easier.  play safe, mean folks self impose lockdown mild flu symptoms Pfizer #1 Pfizer first booster, problems Moderna second booster. family member dog sick second booster (same shots) 36 hours.

It's weird people react differently, I'm starting think needs work done figure why, different reactions could bearing COVID outcome immune system reaction COVID. Israel helpful pandemic terms research &amp; knowledge virus pandemic say many sequenced. South Africa punished diligence test new strains report promptly No, maybe go clubbing necking randoms double tequilas.

Look, new information. choose completely ignore hope best, take reasonable precautions based already know (covid bad, omicron virulent, etc.). people going gamble country think might fine. Come on. Probably true but, one always hope. point y'all anti-China sake comes covid. China right. Time delay symptoms, hospitalisation severity. like quote response “isn’t hysteria, concern”. That’s really succinct way putting Legit praying COVID-19 becomes coronavirus another common cold. Like someday we’ll look back people still run test protocol go, “remember could kill you”? like selling snake oil. truth really depend individual immune system, booster can’t much immune system weak first place. That’s doctor always said, can’t always depend antibiotics, gotta train immune system. guess almost everyone immune system weaken prolong consumption antibiotics. Especially given unknown long term effects. Even person early 20s die many lasting neurological respiratory effects present survivors. That’s vaccine producers world. think it’s unlikely come variant specific vaccine quickly. 

My point is, variant dangerous vaccines effective it, problem next 4-5 months sure. self reported survey. control group. control anything all.

Given earlier, rigorous study France, shows common mistakenly think suffer long COVID. think full scale lockdowns early 2020 going take place, think government even tried implement would completely backfire. said, think masks stay. It’s also difference signs symptoms. sign objective measurement effects disease. fever sign. symptom subjective effect disease. Losing sense taste symptom. 

The thing is, don’t necessarily notice signs. could extensive lung damage show scan, low oxygen saturation, feel fine. That’s one hallmarks COVID. fucks up, low-key. Continuing punish poor countries nothing help anyone. robust testing requirements traveling. know reported patients vaccinated not? anyone it? discussions be/have been:

1. New variant discovered country X 
2. Countries start banning flights country X, people Reddit Twitter say shut international travel, ignoring reality global supply chains can't really stopped.
3. Sequencing shows variant everywhere actually original travel bans probably effective. 
4. People keep talking need border controls even though countries much stop original strain, alpha, beta, delta.

Rinse repeat. moment clarity looking hot takes everyone opinion realized people like autopilot. saying things two years ago. it. “…for unvaccinated” legit got tinnitus too. think caused bupropion almost feel would better say nothing 61 samples tested. tested 13 13 Omicron, that's huge. tested 58 13 Omicron still significant leaves another question Delta come COVID almost gone SA. living here, I've 4 hard lockdowns year, probably tested 50 times 2021. border quarantine work there's still much proactive tracking. Agreed. Pretty much zero data Africa vaccine uptake availability near zero. classic Airplane Armor kinda proven false hospitalization rocketing SA. need Japan bingo! Hope stays way…  “If make brand new vaccine, think that’s going early 2022 that’s really going available large quantities,” said.

Pretty fucking incredible almost end year yet brand new vaccine *that even made yet* could already available ""large quantities"" early next year necessary.

These mRNA vaccines truly amazing accomplishment.  Hahaha lmao. Needing external validation much? One person? That's needed? learn word 'projection'? use word fits conversation beyond me. anything, projecting insecurities 'mature enough' like condescend people circlejerking taking things seriously. Or, going reply back saying ""you're gaslighting me"" that's another fun new buzzword learned? 

Go hit cannabis, sit genuinely think condescending people self-righteousness taking life goddamm seriously.  Stocks reacted 
#1”South African doctor raised alarm omicron variant says symptoms ‘unusual mild’
Dr Angelique Coetzee noticed otherwise healthy patients showing unusual symptoms worries new variant might hurt elderly   Haha yeah let's make situation worse already everywhere world without banning international travels lmao. hate SA tho gotta contain this. Read thread, question answered plenty. country young people unlikely vaccinated. it’s clear unvaccinated risk, tells little effect vaccine variant. Try combined capacity 1.5 billion per month. Yep, I've saying since Thursday ... response much greater variants. conspiracy theorist all, really think ""they"" know something telling us right now, necessarily think that's bad thing unnecessary panic would good point. would anything? That's lot cases hospitals even full no.....Lrrr coming, ruler Omicron Persei 8 think it'll work. lotteries, seeing people dying, jobs requiring work either. people still required show negative COVID test prior boarding international flight? case, heck many cases slip prior screening? No, trials yet. Right they're testing lab see worth trouble making new vaccine.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  think downvoting two reasons. First, cite fictional situation. secondly, would virus's best interest kill host, unless act way could reproduce. 

The ideal situation real world virus would undetectable, basically observably harmless host, infectious. means, able reproduce like crazy long time. 

The goal reproduce. mean COVID patients willingly unvaccinated. murder, choice rely science based medicine. Depriving others much needed ICUs well murder argument, victims make choice.  add optimism, think absolutely better place year ago more. vaccines hold line Omicron, anecdotal evidence leaning toward right South Africa Israel... well, OK long get people vaccinated. got booster weeks ago, wonder new vaccine would needed, would ineligible now? know, kind feeling gotten despite scientific evidence benefits greatly, greatly outweigh potential side effects, going get it. Maybe nudge along 5 10% hold outs, unvaxed people know entrenched defense mechanisms going get vaccinated, even get covid they'll proclaim natural immunity recover it. Unvaxxed = new variant machines

Unvaxxed = end pandemic 

Where see good this?  Brutal totalitarianism great! taking possibility regular flu mutating super flu. thought clear context. anyone noticed every outbreak everywhere, new variant not, always accompanied hospitals saying younger younger people coming in?

This something I’ve noticed happens regularly, I’m sure I’m seeing something isn’t there. 

It’s weird know I’ve read every outbreak far (especially US). looked statistics, never support statements. 

I’m sure I’m missing. Obviously. curious first we’ve seen mention elevated hospitalizations. timing kinda fucked people made holiday plans probably really change point. You’re right. Needed hear this. One thing point genetic evaluation omicron shows mutation entry proteins. Covid used ACE receptors, virus known use. suddenly mutated different entry mechanism, could explain Change symptoms. ACE receptors located respiratory tract, lungs, heart, intestines, fat tissue, vascular endothelium. explains presentations issues Covid. cellular entry mechanism changed, essentially completely different virus cross immunity prior versions. Fauci said today working guidelines help public move believes it’s endemic. freaks out. dramatic reaction first dose already covid, second dose lot better still left heart palps 2 weeks. booster like second dose? I'm hopeful. No, also proves less deadly might actually want everywhere ASAP. think people saw coming. least obvious wouldn’t eradicated. also don’t see issue things you’ve referenced. I’d love things it’s reality. covid stay (and is) respond.  vaccine majorly used Israel ?  Thanks this, definitely will. going away. learn live it.

Living involves getting vaccinated occasionally wearing masks dealing occasional set restrictions like vaccine mandates you. reality people able move lives spite minor restrictions.   Data proven vast majority people hospitals covid right unvaccinated. 
Also yet known effective current vaccines new mutation early findings suggest effective preventing severe sickness hospitalization. work, yes. don’t know, much want know.  described reasons vaccines aren’t silver bullet hoped would be. It’s one part solution need more. vaccines can’t keep cases manageable level focus moved towards treatment. good start anti-viral pills like Pfizer’s (although also likely lead mutations need regularly updated). Great perspective! attempting worked days ago. definitely need break this. Sample size small can't sure certain anything. We're literally going wait &amp; see. chill change happens, accept pretend wasn’t talked concern, like conspiracy theorists calling vaccine passports, vaccine mandates work, requirements “fully vaccinated” status changing? That’s amore We're letting world leader censorship become world leader vaccine production. strings come billions doses they're giving third-world countries? NewIP?  host still infectuous point death, covid really seem case.  don’t think people avoided vaccine prioritized people born Cystic Fibrosis example.  need flu shots work travel? That's really good point. Clearly, kind effect nervous system virus. Either directly cranial nerves perhaps brainstem, *something* goes long term side effects kind neurological damage could prove bad age. ""about 65%""

That's weird number choose cuff estimate. I'd like see actual data. I'd also like see many omicron vs remaining delta infections. Say, 90% admitted patients still testing positive delta, signal lower mortality or, omicron, know delta completely displaced. Also, importance 20% roughly south Africans HIV many TB, making population overall susceptible. 

And, true, GP say mild sick patients going heading hospital. need overall statistics infections, hospitalizations, divide vaccinated, prior infected, zero immunity. That's going require thousands positively identified cases, going weeks.  work making someone else money mean sit ass day. say! there's positive rapid test generally person needs confirm PCR. Sequencing done PCR positive though depends state likely get sequenced (Washington state ~5% PCR positives sent sequencing). PCR tests pick gene knockouts.

Other variants gene knockout can't assume Omicron yet. give clue samples expedited check sure. Malls still exist? Omnicron discovered country low vaccine rates, somehow that's fault vaccinated people want live lives. want prevent variants? Get people vaccinated!  always “the west?”

Why blame India saying would sell tens millions vaccines Africa stop sending vaccinate populous? blame Russia promising millions vaccines mix donations exports send none can’t produce vaccine? well look spanish flu, time nobody vaccinated (because medical technology developed enough) couple years became common cold know today. actually unvaccinated people speeding process making corona harmless This! Put shoes countries' health ministers. care originated SA, China, France, Mars. Slow response irresponsible. pause travel basic facts understood seems prudent. Ok, part said negates cumulative 7 billion shots already committed? side kept saying flu. also predicted vaccine passports, vaccine mandates work participate activities community. strong beliefs wouldn’t one done kind vaccine, would endless requirement get “fully vaccinated”, side called crazy happily got vaccine thinking end concerns. there’s shit pharmaceutical companies thats another discussion. need negative test fly SA double vaccinated arrival country require it. China isn’t world leader anything except censorship. true; people saying they've picked arbitrarily high cutoff new vaccine ""needed"" versus ""is waste"". Multivalent vaccines [better across board every difference tremendous, significant: enough halve dose, enough halve number Delta breakthroughs we'd have. trivalent vaccine (wt+beta+delta) works months, we'd switched would absolutely get several times lower breakthrough rates Delta well better outcome omicron. submission automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* healthcare system definitely fine.

Because people vaccinated unless people get vaccinated, that's going change. Blaming fully vaccinated going back sense normalcy going fix broken healthcare system. would mean people got boosters Chill lol even determined shot necessary, they're testing see better third booster. not, need one. delta variant found necessary. (forgive spamming couple places probably in-depth effort post I've ever made Reddit trying good information soldier).

It's important remember law nature says viruses become less lethal virulent (spread faster/easier). example virus could replicate faster lungs generate viral output respiratory system surrounding air, would make lethal infected host virulent due higher viral output. virus kills host faster kills hosts per capita necessarily imply evolutionary disadvantage. Viral evolution big pile different variables trial errored come novel solutions. example key trait Delta made become problematic higher incidence people infectious becoming symptomatic time tested positive already spread virus others, became increasingly less likely get ahead spread.

I also take lot comfort idea there's much mutation happen spike still able infect human cells. Frankly know large domain possibilities is. example paper way covid attaches cells work, mother nature found solution.

The smart money seems fact omicron definitely going dodge antibody response major way, that's one arm immunity arsenal (but big one obviously ideal disarmed), see happen scary headlines come near term showing convalescent plasma shows almost reactivity omicron, sometime later properly model virus actual populations infected individuals ""real"" news terms lethality.

Another bummer highly mutated Spike current generation monoclonal antibody treatments going hit miss depending individual manufacturers approach synthesizing individual targets. 

It's also silly think 2 years pandemic going see peak fitness given pathogen, viruses generally evolve time scale centuries millennia. 

You also run risk getting situation virus become mutated longer compete different variant functioning completely different virus. example person past vaccine infection immunity infected omicron, there's guarantee natural immunity confer protection something like Delta. 

Our first batch vaccines covid modern miracle exceeded everyone's optimistic expectations fact protection seems wear work well variance flaw immune system work less design vaccines. One thing gives optimism feel next generation vaccines going another gigantic leap opposed variant tweak existing ones. example I'm keeping close eye inhaled vaccines developed China vaccines currently tested target larger stable chunks virus. One silver lining covid absolutely slingshoted vaccine capabilities decades future span 18 months. mRNA technology going change world. 

Having absorbed available data point safe say dozen reasons extremely concerned little reason optimistic, need get lucky weird way (ie, us rolling Yahtzee omicron hyper fast barely dangerous still operates fitness domain Delta properly compete/displace variants). I'm trying neither optimistic pessimistic one instead go data tells us. Thanks. much trouble finding news Russia English. huge story disappeared - Eastern Europe. timescales consider.

Viruses fit kill host, even would giving plenty chances transmitted.

To virus, death 100% immunity. hosts around long periods time pathogens fair better. less fare worse.  isn’t scale up, though. global shortage raw materials finite quantity produced certain components. Certainly slowly scaled, already working highest possible output. still don’t know need specific vaccine given lead time needed make (100 days) it’s better start early. 

Moderna beta + delta specific vaccine original vaccine works well enough wasn’t deployed. 

It’s better options.  Dowsing rods best thing find water. 

They're completely useless They’re definitely experts psychology behavioral economics continue variants, news completely accessable like get much doom'n'gloom life desire. 

I decided basically ignoring news listening local health authority tell (I trust them, know may case people live). 

If something needs change (more restrictions etc) tell me, it. basically care point, need know. lot less stressful go flow, I'm grateful live place many people closely monitoring situation *so to*. cares breaks health care system effect infected.

And vaccination rate country is...? Generally speaking video games great thing cite discussion virology. 

Stopped reading that. joke. Jesus. Delta around months got huge dangerous, think governments learning last time trying overly cautious avoid mistake. course media helping stirring panic. No, waste. Multivalent vaccines would cost same, changeover would cost almost nothing, would small fraction Delta breakthrough rate, would significantly better future variants (that last we've known months, certainly would better Omicron). Major caveats needed story. Israel ONE confirmed Omicron case 11 likely cases. mostly younger mostly vaccinated early disease course.

This tells us nothing. Yet. way immune system works, even 100% something similar new, still effective. People SARS-1 partial good immunity SARS-2/COVID. immunity original still gives head start Omicron future new variants. pay attention wanting anyone else says Israel. figure US government consistently engaged policy balancing public perception, scarcity, people tolerate, etc. 

Israel gives fucks man objective always been... keep people safe thriving (all policies based whether agree methods not). want good information, look doing. so, vaccinated people one spreading new variant now? (flights requires vaccine countries) Nobody knows yet, nobody enough data omnicron yet. government spokesperson making claim omnicron early tells one thing: concerned. find way get rid sound know screen time? 
Happened three weeks ago its... Hard. okay, they're still testing. decent chance current booster effective omicron, beta delta well. suck international travel even positive test means getting stuck extra 2 weeks country. even make sense. might well say talking Omicron South Africa fucked up, agree South Africa fuck up. Could outside agenda treating China differently there? Keep mind way Delta went well. Early reports terrifying, everyone speculating immune escape, ended mostly pandemic unvaccinated. 

That's still terrible clogs hospitals, can't keep allowing that, true ""back square one"" moment. People refer southern Africa. conversation today. south african. Why? didnt want list roughly 10 15 countries independently. Arguably robust testing requirements travel. flying KLM required negative tests prior flying. Yet still, 10 % positive arrival. early tell. likely survivorship bias  And?

Ready early 2022. take years vaccinate everyone it, many anyway, new variant inevitably come along. Rinse, repeat. told un vaccinated even believe virus What’s worse conspiracy folks saying it’s anagram moronic think despite much contrary  I'm Ireland, 93%+ vaccination rate 12s one highest case numbers Europe atm. people still blame 7% unvaccinated what's happening, world gone bit nuts. People pointing fingers suits politicians. Everytime you’ve gotten shot it’s knocked out? gotten two doses booster, I’m young 23 literally didn’t get single symptom greater sore arm. wouldn’t surprised got sick one shot every shot doubt. nut jobs always claimed like flu. people get seasonal flu shots. ok scenario, no? got booster, friend got one j&amp;j afaik, idk roommates have. They’re currently working rolling vaccines infants children 5. Makes sense since babies get lot vaccines first two years life.  still early tell. biased media science. need larger pool people vaccinated infected. This. Evolution purposeful, result. I'm glad forcing vaccine troops, opinion try avoid tried traitors   says article. absolutely evidence back assertion. Omicron starts killing higher percentage ""over it""... early tell.   course getting 3 shots one year seem like lot we're also still learning lot virus effectiveness vaccines. Antibody levels reported something around 25x higher booster (3rd dose 6 months 2nd dose) compared 1st 2nd dose.  next question long antibodies lasting? know Canada recommending 8 weeks first second doses pediatric covid vaccine help reduce adverse events increase effectiveness vaccine (as seen vaccinations). We're global pandemic moving speed science. Let's wait see happens. already get annual flu shot changes based circulating strain get different covid shot reason?

Other mentioned side effects, we're still nowhere near ""annual"" ""seasonal"" concern. people got shots 6-7 months ago. month got get booster. we're already potentially talking need something else ASAP. really difficult pill swallow people.   10% people flying planes country COVID. sucks economy, that’s statement fact. South African government really using effort they’re putting portraying victims two things would much protective people:

- Encouraging vaccination. South Africa actually [asked postpone vaccine order due low demand days Make PCR tests affordable accessible: COVID testing isn’t free South Africa like middle income countries, people pay pocket it’s [unaffordable working It’s really awful government claiming testing great, testing available working poor people, allowed spread undetected long. would helpful doubt work way. Delta ripped community, still get vaccinated, seems like feet dug pretty good. Plus, many states worst summer surges low rates, they've really promoting natural immunity crap. Omicron's immunity evasion likely surprise (looking Florida), South Africa hit low baseline Delta surge Omicron came started another huge spike. Ugh.  Also know going wreck body long term. Better cautious. seem hopeful people saying is, especially severely immunocompromised people. 

Surrounding vaccinated loved ones healthcare workers provided sense safety/comfort -- even boosted individuals could ""mild"" case unknowingly spread immunocompromised person, could kill them. 

 Unless effective cure horizon, could death sentence immunocompromised vaccines/boosters fail much anything variant.  using traditional vaccine much effective e.g. weakened virus. we'll get antibodies much virus. understand takes longer develop using live pathogens company working this? article says one confirmed case twelve suspected cases. seems like awfully small sample draw conclusions severity. think youre taking lot seriously am. also might less severe version competes Delta. Please go see family actual fuck...  would ignore HIV stuff, notice viral strain “might” things, recognize don’t know much yet. still measures take individuals help keep safe. Maybe you’re aware [theory evolution adaptation? ](http://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/adaptation/). 
Don’t get wrong, don’t think viruses this.  Shoot. Lmao flight Europe set leave literally day closed borders 2020. Maybe stop making plans. Thanks. It’s cause country different health safety standards different standards testing done Fun fact, US around 10% case positivity peak delta surge, see devastation. tells two things SA's 10% positivity, shrugging at: 1) denominator, total number people actually getting tested low, test absolutely necessary 2) case numbers actually pretty high numbers suppressed.

...In cases, shows badly SA's healthcare infrastructure capability manage curb spread virus. 61/600 passengers positive two KLM flights alarming SA. I'm surprised SA chosen defensive move though; that's countries seem claim responsibility.  Tip: Stop reading much news / Reddit much. Obviously important informed, lots people making lots money sensational headlines. algorithm care developing depression hopelessness, wants click, matter what.  standard US, Los Angeles County mandate, anyone wants ignore one says word stressed cases vaccinated people infected became slightly ill.

It ought standard practice specific symptom profile point. exact symptoms? long last?

We've before, medical authorities using terms like ""mild"" leaving open interpretation scare public, reality ""mild"" used clinical definition of, ""anything short requiring supplemental oxygen."" say, much potential become very, *very* sick ""mild"" disease.

""Slightly ill"" certainly step mild, that's good, past point vaguery. Give us specifics. Yeah play. Ashkenazi Jews lot health issues reason cautious. Israel's health department play.  much transmissible would virus if, instead killing 1 200 killed 1 2000, transmission.

It would 0.45% infectious.

Seriously, myth transmission lethality rate apply Sars-cov-2. might paper apply virus fatality rate. concerning aspect (other obvious) getting boosted now. current boosters effective enough, leave people? still provides decent protection totally see waiting next fall next adjusted booster. hard imagine gotten booster last week, get another one 3 months. can't imagine uptake would look like. really ought stop calling experts. Eventually agree unvaccinated don’t deserve hospitalization? say family members vaccinated one infected. Get vaccinated get dying. Yeah, like happened delta, already probably weeks. big question whether nasty variant like delta something less dangerous. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:
  
[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Omg!!! omicron crazy!!!!!! Should, won't. unvaccinated adults unvaccinated choice feel strongly it. ""Those service members pre-existing conditions."" think one Nobel Prizes go towards individuals developed covid vaccines   Apparently quote saying cases mild taken completely context. spike protein makes covid-19 deadly, large number mutations spike protein make less deadly…I really think world panicked prematurely this. personally hope annual flu shot uptake increase. know amount misinformation increased pandemic awareness much vaccinations help us. know learned lot pandemic vaccines immune system, continue read learn strictly curiosity. can’t test willing human volunteers? would gladly sign help others. excuse animal testing, 100% unethical. Covid virus spike proteins, bits jut orb body virus. spike proteins virus fuses host cell process called proteases. Essentially, virus evolving via mutations spike protein better fuse host cells. Many mutations much concern, faster virus mutate, faster could possibly reach mutation highly effective. Omicron variant mutates lot, potential reach highly effective mutation previous variants mutate slowly all. Regardless that, people states still get vaccinated. knows, maybe next mutant variant originate (although probably wouldn’t ones find surveillance sucks). Could imagine uproar happening? need make illegal unvaxxed. I'm talking jail time.  think world panicking again

So far I've seen lot concern, real biggest panic seen financial markets. 

Markets react severity illness. react negatively uncertainty general. saying Israel older people? Life expectancy Israel 82, 4 years United States. us gotten 2-3 already. annual, three one year (witha possible 4th ont way).

And side effects seem way worse flu vaccine. Unfortunately 50% best see way. rest tell lied everything farce. compare official death number Wuhan New York city, similar population size, population density, unpreparedness covid.

The death rate New York City first three months per 100k 62 (source: NY city government). New York city eight million people (8000k), total covid death 5000. roughly official covid deaths Wuhan. live Michigan shit show here. Delta? take non incentivised advice spent plenty time mainland Chinese believe not. Also occasions.

Many idea world outside China, ones travel small minority exposure.

Its nothing wearing mask not, content deflecting reality onto another country. Remember two years ago people said would mutate something way contagious way less serious? isn’t considered anymore? Exactly!! still spread COVID vaccinated. pretty bad breakthrough case 6 months second shot I'm still recovering 2 weeks later. also ended ER suspected damage heart. don’t know expected happen, honestly. 

“Rest world, discovered potentially harmful, highly-mutated version covid may originated here. think?”

“We need prevent variant leaving country, that’s need do.”

“What!?”

They really thought world would react way? Definitely anecdotal. fine hope based anecdotes. Give many nice anecdotes possible right now. Pump good anecdotes straight veins. States like 80% vaccinated adults btw. 

But, i've three GD shots last 8 months... chances i'll get 4th variant REALLY slim unless dangerous fuck. yet like variant T’Challa-as-Star-Lord universe, maybe it’ll kinder, gentler Thanos. Buy dip suppose mention hotels would checked several times day offered medication. hospitalized, resources used conditions monitored. Vaccine equity never going reality.

Imagine government telling young people (voters) wait 2-3 years everyone vaccinated get vaccine.

Long story short, making proclamations wouldn’t charge long. good news early on. think key metric affects unvaccinated vs Delta. looking increased surge ICUs worse (maybe even less severe) Delta? Let's hope less severe case. 45% vaccinated likely mamy one dose.  don’t understand mindset. Either virus everywhere like claim every country would picking existence anyways, need “punish” South Africa also big deal wouldn’t publicize existence. virus isn’t everywhere, means South Africa publicizing great also lockdowns would even important. feel like articles cherry-pick situations two mutually exclusive possibilities. Definitely valid concern missing work option lot people. main reason boosters increase neutralizing antibodies prevent infection (and spread) begin with. like vaccines receive early life rely B cells prevent serious illness. Increasing neutralizing antibodies outbreak help control spread think something take consideration deciding whether get booster. major outbreak we're trying control? getting ill cause miss work compared two days needed vaccination? There's lot consider ultimately decision (given workplace government mandated booster).  really, best sort thing don’t know test  always, unvaccinated babysit  understand that. Vaccine equity access huge problem. It’s shame states ample supply people refuse vaccine. People countries would ecstatic have. something noticed media started April 2020. really made chuckle XD won’t. They’ll downvote anyone asking keep moving.  England though, Wales Scotland never stopped mask restrictions. Wales also tighter self isolation rules still place. Ehhh stuck metric ""we need go winter less 10,000 cases per day"" two straight fall seasons. think 2 week window carefully observed monitor variant. days, we'll much much clearer picture. optimistic say rn variant bad younger ones. would delayed? China quarantine measures place, covid policies place, tests / vaccines readily available athletes even countries without yet (vaccine apartheid :( ), unless athletes want vaccinated good go, no?  saying may many mutations varying lethality. worked ER decade viral flu seasons worse others. Flu vaccines educated guess mutations coming next flu season. 

I comparing COVID flu. coronavirus devastating viral pandemic, accelerated international travel, disparities amongst people’s access obtaining vaccine, undeniably politicized propagandized media coverage. 

I downplaying Omicron variant “a younger sibling that’s weaker contagious”. wayyyy soon tell largely mutated variant effect humans. 

My point was, geo-political situation going on, addition ease travel social disparity, able contain coronavirus becoming chronic, endemic disease. reckon boosters every 6-8 months years learn lethality mutations. reckon adapt COVID new ways, reform social norms. 

I’m saying CANNOT become transmissible lethal. I’m saying increased transmissibility viral agents historically longitudinally correlated lethality time. 

The flu still kills hell lot people. Vaccines eliminated “flu season”. They’re best guess inoculate people may best scientific guess evolution mutations virus. 

Again, point is, foresee COVID becoming akin flu. NOW!!! easily alikened Spanish Flu pandemic - lil’ cold. Horribly devastating, overwhelming resources capacity (even disaster flex operation), potentially able mutate worse less severe fatality rates… depending multitude factors. 

It could easily become transmissible lethal - especially globalization. But, 10-15 years time, probably highly mutating virus advise everyone get shots annually, inoculate best scientific guess mutations be. 

It’s going away. I’m saying it’s big deal. “misinformation” spreading?? study done showed people recovered 1918 flu still responded strongly challenged 90 years later. Herd immunity temporary, coronaviruses mutate way much long term immunity wanted herd immunity globally would need vaccinate almost everyone short period, coronavirus always animal vectors pass back humans. Herd immunity myth globally cant believe still mindset eradication holding everything back never eradicated. read they're vaccinated they're fine Omicron. new sequence. FDA approvals greatly streamlined sequence tweak vaccine design. differentiation subtle. forcibly vaccinating people (""Impfzwang""), declaring law everyone expected vaccinated (""Impfpflicht""). 

The latter opens ability legal consequences vaccinated, like higher healthcare deductions etc. “So let’s say” isn’t scientific argument. Bring facts data. think that's works. Delta Omicron exist time. Maybe one imparts immunity other, think whole thing new ""variant"" don't. data science behind , predicting antibodies escape new mutations. Geneticist tracking it. saying it’s like new strain. unvaccinated got covid worst symptom headache 2 days. Im good. Ah shit. Buckle up. go again... 1) Delta didnt spread SA many times more, also similarly vs. delta.

It suspected mutated HIV patient whose immune system basically gone, nut virus time body mutate longer Okay. instance there’s least known myocarditis adults mRNA vaccines: fine. It’s relatively minor far data. say even reduce half, that’s many fewer hospital stays. That’s good!

Nobody saying don’t vaccinate. Nobody saying they’re bad. We’re saying something even rare risks give 6b people you’ll eventually handful bad outcomes. 

That’s expected. 

But halve something rare make even rarer that’s even better!

I’m sure controversial, honest.  True, certainly isn’t going keep spreading. I’m interested seeing learned last two years we’re going apply next cycle.  Check HCA, delta kills less week. probably already designed options. nice AI computer has. that's good, I've seeing minimum 3 months think worth counting natural immunity delay booster imo Well, central banks drowned world liquidity tune trillions dollars, that's one reasons rising prices everywhere, monetary inflation.

So crash comes next weeks think central banks caught rock hard place comes monetary inflation, prices especially consumer goods services could get hand(if already areas).

We already seeing play Turkey, Erdogan ordered Turkish central bank lower interest rates spur economic growth, (and past) monetary inflation already eating purchasing power Lira lunch Erdogan facing plummeting popularity this.  told people 3 shots spread well, then? need vaccines natural immunity. preferable. immunity getting virus vaccines, better are. really hope misinformation strong. bad, way worse delta, need go lockdown Bad comparison. implying masks staying ""normal"" garment. Sorry BS. Again, strongly abide *now*, expect everyone keep using calms down. 50-50, okay. 

You understand full grasp this. Let explain you:

* Masking distancing go *hand hand*, i.e. one measure work without other. example, 20 people single room, wearing masks (maybe N95s best), distance, chances spreading still there. separate them, abiding distancing, take masks off. going spread virus anyways.
* abiding masking long run, means going abide social distancing long run well. can't done forever. Masks maybe, distancing cannot. Isolation decades destructive mind, like happens lifers prisons isolated 23-24 hours (ok, got tad extreme there, thing social distancing since tied masking, long run going bring terrible effects society). Distancing long run means gatherings, parties, social life outside zoom. simply living, existing. I’ve got lupus lots issues…so I’m right ya…. “infect” vax w/ thing. felt weather couple days. :) Comparatively, sure. delta run course unaware new one. admit he’s full bull, admit they’ve taking bad advice almost 2 years now. Almost one brave Everyone getting tetanus booster every 10 years, 5 years get severe wound.


Healthcare workers literally checked see immunity mmr, tdap, etc given boosters.


Yearly flu shots.


I think everything children get multiple doses aka boosters.


To people covid vaccines 100% politics nothing health them.  one knows current vaccines stack omicron. would certainly get booster kind original 2-shot series. FDA already said earlier year approval reformulation trivial compared previous process, like flu vaccines, platform tested approved. manufacturers didn’t end pursuing production delta focused ones boosters first versions useful enough. surprising read Moderna executive scare public comments. stock price 20.5% Friday, adding $26 billion value purely Omicron. I’m glad Moderna world we’ll getting better info academics without multi-billion dollar profit incentives. -_- it. Cite ONE study aspiration would prevented Myocarditis. exactly thing vaccines, new man-made variant would spreading competing variants. Nah dude. Regular flu virus mutates two weeks thing two years. 

It's still 99.9% original virus. regular year flu virus changes 0.5% wish time sit around find anagrams things disliked nothing anything, even time, stupidity think anagram actually means anything  Fuck literally got boosted do, Omicron detected Tuesday, already Hong Kong, UK Belgium, likely already arrived NYC, made way around states undetected, event bypasses immunity.

Now one question reaffect people who've already contracted covid previously. would suck big time. “Took risk” like it’s somehow way even semi voluntary, bot? Lol Based what. US 3 weeks away 70% fully vaxxed, thankfully.  daily flight Delta ATL always full one deltas profitable routes. understand someone autism would struggle it. severe anxiety related breathing know tough long hours, really affects anyone flights. quick grocery store trip, think manageable. get bidet Logic one idiot taking advice another idiot. pi next one omicron? looking greek pi next, unlikely big variant (there many those). might get tau Lateral flow tests don’t qualify everything I’ve seen. It’s PCR. Half dose fine. might lose mind first.  Nah. There's still much understand immunity. predict changes evade antibodies much. 

They also can't predict rest immune system react. 

Or virus changes deleterious. Nature combined known mutations immune escape found resulting virus ""replication competent attenuated"". Somehow combo mutations made reproduce slower reason Derp KF94 reliable KN95 get 3rd dose booster 1/2 dose ?   people want live Middle Ages.

I still Janitor's silent sobs. Australia 2 people tested positive arrived plane. thing infective surprised people flight test positive net couple days. Well, need toilet paper much, go store get pack. know somebody bidet? /s SA doctors also said aren’t sure elderly people enough elderly infected. 

We don’t know people infected recently (who unvaccinated) actually partial protection past infection earlier variant. Maybe it’s pretty deadly elderly person immunity all. don’t data yet. Travelers don’t tend old/frail either. prefer human immune system. 

Super cringe, know.   media offers titles ""everything need know"" ""we know nothing"" variant read enough posts people double vaxxed still getting multiple breakthrough infections. Obviously enough end hospital. However, even new variant squeezes Delta even toxic Delta, still likely segment population need hospitalisation perhaps die. Thinking along lines seasonal flu also kills people year. numbers game. r0 Alpha 3.8. Delta 6.5. Omicron 500 times infective original covid. Even morbidity mortality greater original covid still expect many people get sick. may die. Well news coming soon Wow, disturbing tragic. What's problem. think authority figures allowed share opinions? Fuck .... Maybe 7th? Oh, almost forgot, record, world managed vaccinate 3.3 billion least 2 doses, almost 2.75 times population Africa (1.2 billion). Let sink in.

And China virtually managed vaccinate entire population, 1.4 billion, slightly population Africa. Yep, might used crappy Cansino vaccine, least managed fully vaccinate population Cansino, slow approving Cansino COVAX mechanism, could given surplus doses Africa. guarantee approves Cansino, ever do, Africa's vaccination rate problems could solved, made millions doses.

LET SINK IN. matter, massive outlier. Natural immunity broader, booster changes things. That's humans think they're exempt worst case scenarios desperately want go life usual awesome thank much. ill continue dig read. guess full pie decided ask question here. also ive digging around weird stock stuff. heckin Sears stock then....oh dear, im rambling new varient It’s not. Delta came basically left (infected lots people ran victims) South Africa earlier year. Omicron could gain footing probably either evades immunity raised Delta infection, natural immunity wearing off. Delta peak July. That's sequenced traveler Mozambique. bet ton cases know variant sequenced them. I'm triple vaccinated SARS-CoV-2 virus I'm particularly worried there. fucking headlines variant might drive completely mad though. friendliest burn ever seen Yet gotten downvoted stating facts. upvoted though.   got exactly 20 days go till fly loved ones...
Im terrified able again.

I can't handle another xmas completely alone. links watch ?? Im double jabbed caught it, ill week, ill either. Thank scientists. Celebrations even last 1 month  good news. Better yet, ""Get vaccinated **reduce chances** getting sick."" binary. get vaccinated still get sick still die, probabilities happening much lower. Almost everyone SA probably exposure delta variant. coal

yes.. tho canary showing practically symptoms...

perhaps variant vaccine itself.... “This great news public know”, said one FOX Network. Yeah live London past couple weeks I've noticed big uplift people coming overseas, many tourists city well people coming visit family long last. everywhere. panic, there's reason assume harmful previous variants. concerns transmissability vaccine effectiveness, virulence. routinely speak people? Like troops tell pull ass? Betting pulled ass. **England** People patient want I’m getting booster. enforced quarantine worked?  Seems bit optimistic, no? Denmark masks also gone since august, parlanent figured enough vaccinated 

They'll probably back couple weeks well going great covid cases. *England 

The rest us U.K. wearing masks places since introduced.

Different areas country also different stages development - remote poor areas unlikely infrastructure accurate monitoring viral spread.

But, know accept Chinese government enforces extremely strict lockdowns even single infection detected. Honestly think many viral hotspots go unreported get completely locked while. else central government wants exude total control. infections also blamed foreigners moment.

It would take another Wuhan-like outbreak shift government narrative they're complete control vs. failing outside world.

Michigan going absolutely nuts, outside state, many northern states seeing winter surges climb past rates time last year. Even infectious less deadly variant seems like would throwing gas fire many areas. looking forward it. delta doesn’t scare you, Omicron wouldn’t"
